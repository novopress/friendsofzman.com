        Well, we‚Äôll never have another Scottish Enlightenment.  Whatever you may think of Jordan Peterson, heard him once make an excellent observation.  Basically, we have all this focus on sending everybody, regardless of cognitive ability to college.  To graduate we have to dumb everything down and what they learn is insufficient to support themselves. What we should be doing if focusing ‚Äúwhat can a 90IQ person do that is both useful to them and society, but we don‚Äôt‚Äù. Same issue with importing vast quantities of 75IQ Central Africans and Incas.  The dirt ain‚Äôt magic.  Never has been.

            InThe Wizard of Ozgifting the Scarecrow a diploma as a substitute for his missing brain was a joke; now it‚Äôs considered fundamental to creating an egalitarian society. For a race so reverential of science, we are approaching Aztec levels of ignorance and superstition.

                        Lineman, I saw a little vid of guys crawling along power lines carrying 750,000 amps.  Think of the brainpower to figure out how to do that.  Think of the brainpower to build those transmission lines.
These are the types that are building and maintaining oil wells at the bottom of the ocean underneath the Arctic glaciers and drilling volcanos for geothermal turbines in Iceland.

Good movie. Some parts of it are kind of stupid but that‚Äôs hollywood for ya. The core theme is very on point.
‚ÄúCity of Brass‚Äù by Kipling is a great poem too. Tangentially related theme. A century old parable that applies more than ever today. Weak men(and women now) create hard times.

                    Exactly. We have been fed the great lie that to work with your *hands* is not to work with your *mind*!

                        It‚Äôs not a great lie. It‚Äôs shitty work. It takes a toll on your body. You don‚Äôt work and rub elbows with the best class of people and these days they also don‚Äôt have the best kinds of behaviors and you‚Äôre signing up for a lot of dysfunction.My dad was a college boy but when he immigrated to the United States, he ended up in construction. He rued every single day of his working life. In fact, he used to take my brother and me on jobs just to pound into our head that we were not to do this with our lives. It worked. We didn‚Äôt follow his career path and I don‚Äôt regret a single day that I didn‚Äôt.Mike Rowe is just an actor. Dirty Jobs is not that glamorous in real life.

                            In the old days work required a combination of mind and body. Work had not been disassembled into ‚Äúmental work‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical work.‚Äù The craftsmen in the pre-industrial age had a combination of mental and physical skills and aptitudes.Vestiges of this still survive today if you can find a self-employed car mechanic who invests his soul in his work.

Yes, the trade are hard on the body, which is what retirement was supposed to be about it. The original aim was to not 65 year olds drop dead on physically demanding jobs.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with these jobs, but as I often say, Jewish mothers don‚Äôt push their kids to be welders. If all of you dopes are going to push your kids in this direction, then don‚Äôt come here and gripe because the Jews own and control everything in this country.

                                    Yes, I‚Äôve seen both sides of it too. I don‚Äôt come from a long line of college graduates.As I type this, I am physically exhausted from some remodel work that frankly we can‚Äôt afford to have done right now. It probably wouldn‚Äôt be up to my standards at this stage of my life anyway. We remodeled 90% of our house only to fire our general contractor for fraud about 25% of the way through, and finished it ourselves with subs.Yes, I‚Äôve seen the underbelly of the trades and meet some genuinely great contractors along the way. I know what this work is like, which is why I agree that there less than ideal people in them.‚ÄúPlumbers and welders don‚Äôt run America.‚ÄùIn weird way, yes they do. It just requires seeing a world that exists when those men shrug as a collective. Nobody cares if the CEO never showed up.And honestly, union carpentry is a great job compared to some of the factory work that dominated the 20th century. A little dangerous at times, depending on the subspecialty. However, it‚Äôs thinking man‚Äôs work and highly respectable. It‚Äôs only Dad‚Äôs attitude and ingratitude about it that made it not that way. I assume there was a native son who might have appreciate that job, rather than decades of grumbling from an immigrant.I also note the trade is also that of a very important Nazarean, one of my favorite people.‚Äúut as I often say, Jewish mothers don‚Äôt push their kids to be welders. If all of you dopes are going to push your kids in this direction, then don‚Äôt come here and gripe because the Jews own and control everything in this country.‚ÄùThey own everything because of the the off the charts greed of Americans and immigrants and the collapse of the native elite, who also take their plumbing for granted. The problem is not the money, because Jewish moms would be sending them right now in droves. The problem is that it‚Äôs not prestigious. That may also be one of the stumbling blocks with Jesus in their world.

                                        I don‚Äôt know, @Wiffle. I had a good tech career in an office, followed by a couple decades running my own companies, but nothing compares to when I built my house. Not sub it out. We drove every nail. We put in the electrical, plumbing, HVAC, septic, etc. Cable chases and conduit so we could pull wires when Cat 5 would eventually become obsolete. Climbing through trusses 20+ feet off the floor in order to set them in place. Installing every window, every skylight.
I kind of feel sorry for people who don‚Äôt experience that.

                                            Here‚Äôs what you need to answer Steve to have this discussion.  Assuming you went to college, what did you major in that helped you in your ‚Äúsuccessful career‚Äù?I believe no one is arguing that a college degree when earned in a rigorous disciple is not useful or desirable.  It is those people who sit in class for 5 years and run up debt with little prospect of what to do with their worthless degree when they finally receive them is the issue.Even assuming that every college graduate is a ‚Äúsharp cookie‚Äù (ha) does not make up for a degree which has no market value.  Hence the pointing to alternative training and job seeking.

Computer science, until I dropped out to become a systems programmer at Control Data. Then back later to get a Chemical Engineering degree because I thought I needed to BE a PE rather than just hire one. Worst mistake of my life.
But, yeah, if Chem E is a worthless degree, there are a lot worse.

You guys got a good deal out of it. Everybody in my extended family (first cousins and their kids) finished college and ended up doing something productive with our lives, not to mention we‚Äôre white. Not a single loser among us. Even if together we‚Äôre all net zero, my brother puts us in the plus range by delivering babies. You gained with my clan. üòÅ

                                My father had to quit formal schooling after 8th grade.  He got a day job and had to go to a night school for training to find employment.  He apprenticed, if that‚Äôs the term over there, during the occupation so he had a skilled trade in which to find employment.  I still have his school records.  It got him a resident VISA to this country!He worked hard, but the labor was no worse that what a faculty member does in front of his computer all day.  He was an avid reader.  When he died, his apartment looked like a library.  Shelves and shelves of books in the living room and bedroom and on the floor.  I remember reading some of them as a child.  He was no stupid man and yet, he worked with his hands.

                                However, America was built on manual labor for whites, no matter what your Dad found distasteful and beneath him.What a nasty last line. What a willful misreading for the purposes of social validation. That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs saying at all. Your idiotic cruise ship vacation line shows that you haven‚Äôt left the 1970s. Americans lucky enough to land in 1950-1980 are clueless about reality. Clueless. Living on old family tales about how hard Dad worked but it was all about BUILDIN‚Äô MURIKA FOLKS.Well, it doesn‚Äôt matter now buddy, because we ain‚Äôt slaving for you any longer. Every white male I ever interviewed with was determined to keep as many whites out of his office as possible, so he‚Äôd stay the smartest one in the room until he moved on. And go figure, that‚Äôs what the white owners of capital started doing to us in the 1970s and 1980s, too. (Sorry, Pete, just gave your job to a Mexican, still see you on the 4th of July, right?).I figure that‚Äôs a decent metaphor for the US at this point. White guys still stabbing each other in the back over how hard grampy had it laying bricks and whether it taught him character and The American Way.

Very few of whom know which end of a screwdriver to use. All is needed is an mba from an on line school,  the ability to blow lots of smoke and of course no consience.The days i miss it Ill go visit some of the guys that are still working in what i call the real world, most of them look even worse than i do.

                            TempoNick.  No one is talking about hard work and effect on the body.  That‚Äôs just your hobby horse.  We are talking about the denigration of people who do manual labor of a highly skilled type.If you have what it takes to achieve a college degree in a rigorous course of study, then by all means achieve it.  However, last I read the latest generation had about 40% obtaining a tertiary degree of some sort.  That‚Äôs waay too many‚Äîand the overwhelming number are majoring in faux courses of ‚Äústudy‚Äù. You get your degree in some worthless field of study, then wind up as a receptionist in a doctor‚Äôs office trying to figure out how to pay back your loans.Is going bankrupt and living hand to mouth while working in an air conditioned office better than construction work?  Really?  No everyone is cut out for college and purely intellectual based jobs.  Nor for that matter is every tradesmen skilled and qualified in his field.  I simply maintain that the tradesmen who have impressed me the most are not some dummies who could not make it in college.  That elitism shit went out in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs when colleges turned into money making ventures specializing in tuition milking of students via Fed aid.

                                And I don‚Äôt disagree with anything you wrote. But much like the people who keep pushing buggery on children, I get the same feeling from these people dismissive of sending kids to college and pushing them into the trades. Of course college is not for everyone and of course we need plumbers and welders. I just don‚Äôt like this whole notion of pushing kids into the trades so that we can end up being the serf class servicing our Jewish and Indian overlords, unclogging their toilets while they run everything and hoover up all the money in the economy.

                                Agreed,@Compsci, and I‚Äôd go further. Outside of a few select fields where licensing is an issue, like medicine, or where it‚Äôs otherwise a requirement, like academia, a college degree is not for the capable, ambitious, intelligent person, who can do better without.
Yes, my kids got engineering degrees, but mostly  preventative. They had no idea whether they had what it took to make it without the credentials.

                            These guys haven‚Äôt done it. They‚Äôll pose here as if they have. But my bro was done at 41 as a plumber. Saved a lot, but it‚Äôs not going to last him until he‚Äôs 75, not with the four kids he thought he‚Äôd be able to support.
It‚Äôs brutal work, they do things to their necks when young that cause lasting nerve damage because they think they‚Äôre Spiderman. Then that first fall reminds them of what‚Äôs inside that 190-pound envelope, and how easy it is to break stuff in there.

                                    If jew tactics didn‚Äôt work they wouldn‚Äôt be running the West. They may be running it into the ground but they are still running it. And jews don‚Äôt jew each other very often.Especially when threatened, even in a small way. They tribe up and go hard on nepotism. Look into the founding of the ADL and Leo Frank. Terrible story, but it‚Äôs what happened.Pride and honor are virtues, but Hubris leads to defeat. The best dictum is almost always a well thought out balance. We can‚Äôt create a nice place to live if we do not control our own homelands. Don‚Äôt sell your soul, but don‚Äôt fall into foolish pride either. We are dying out. We have gone from 25% of the world to 8% in less than a century.Think of it like this‚Ä¶ if every other boxer is using steroids and PEDs but you‚Ä¶ you are gonna lose. Doesn‚Äôt make steroids a good idea, but in a world where the rules are constantly bent and broken‚Ä¶ name a cyclist who isn‚Äôt Lance Armstrong.

                                    He is strawmanning but his point is valid. Plumbers and electricians wield no actual power. Unions are run by shills nowadays. Almost everyone at the top has been bribed.
Unions have to potential to wield power, but the people at the top of them would have to be replaced with people who refuse to take personal bribes.

                                    Unions haven‚Äôt been strong since the 50‚Äôs. Almost 50% of workers were unionized back then. But then the owners starting bringing in black scab labor and‚Ä¶ in 2024 less than 10% of workers are in unions. The few that remain almost never bargain for anything political. It‚Äôs slightly higher pay and an extra few days of sick leave only.
Offshoring continues unabated and millions of illegal and legal immigrants arrive every year to keep the labor supply in the rentier classes‚Äô favor domestically.

                    I would not be surprised that at some not too distant point of the future that work experience can be used in lieu of an undergraduate degree to get an MBA or something. Because what‚Äôs invariably going to happen is that the best of the trades guys wants to differentiate himself or get some business knowledge to start his own thing and that next step is some kind of formal education. To make him the total package.  Maybe not an MBA which is a generic degree, but something that teaches them the basics of accounting and finance etc.   Say something like the first year curriculum of an MBA.But the point being, a hybrid work-education model could be the shit as they say for the better of the bunch. Sort of like an enlisted deciding to finish college so he can get his officer stripes and becoming an officer means something to him as he gets older.   Which as it so happens is where my son is at.

                        ‚ÄúI would not be surprised that at some not too distant point of the future that work experience can be used in lieu of an undergraduate degree to get an MBA or something.‚ÄùThat has already been the case for many years, at least in Europe, where a combination of relevant work experience and professional qualification (but no undergrad degree) can get you into a business school. And even if you can‚Äôt, there are various programs in place where a short course or combination of such will get you some sort of diploma or certificate. Universities and business schools are in the racket of selling pieces of paper of rather dubious worth for hard cash.But this also makes sense in that an undergrad degree long ago lost all meaning as an indication of intellectual mettle or scholarly rigor. I recall one extreme case of an American college graduate who literally could not read and taught social studies for 17 years before finally confessing he was illiterate. On an anecdotal level, I keep running into college graduates who cannot read at what used to considered sixth- or seventh-grade level. Likewise for numeracy.

                            Did a lot of work with Lloyds in my career.  Traditionally, bright high school grads apprenticed in the market, took professional courses like accounting as necessary and moved up to become syndicate managers.  Met some of them, far more qualified than the MBAs they brought in.

                As long as Uncle Sam pays the bills, higher education will *not* run out of fools.  Most all colleges/universities have bought into the great lie of equality.

                            Yes, you‚Äôre seeing those people as beneath you, which is exactly how the Jews see the trades.People who can do things matter, even if the construction is not filled with the height of humanity. God loves the poor, which is why He made so many of themFormal education is the way to take dumb, incompetent people and give them a sense of superiority. It does nothing to actually improve them. It actually threatens to make them useless eaters for most of their life. The people with problems in the trades are least honest about it.

                                    Again, you miss a point.  They don‚Äôt make less money.  The average degree holder 1) Doesn‚Äôt work in his field of study, and 2) Doesn‚Äôt find a job that pays as much as a skilled tradesmen.
No one here has said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go to college, take a job at the nearest McDonalds.‚Äù  What the general discussion dwells on is whether or not college is for you.  Simply getting a degree after 5 years does not mean college was for you.  The question is, ‚ÄúHow did you college experience set you up for the rest of you productive life?‚Äù

                    ‚ÄúFor all the carping about Jews on these boards, and I‚Äôm one of them who carps, at least they take education seriously.‚Äù
A certain kind of education, one that focuses on words, semantics, arguments, that is theoretical in nature but does not have much contact with the real world. Whereas white education focuses more on the real world and the theoretical underpinning for real world phenomena. This is one of many distinctions between Jews and whites.

The slave trade is hard work and takes smarts, ok.  But that‚Äôs not the kind of meritocracy I want running the world.

                            All those people exist in the larger framework of a Gentile world, built on experimentation and real world results. Apparently Christians even invented double entry bookkeeping.There is a certain type of absent minded scholar that no one minds helping, because they are grateful for the more practical people of the world. Holding up abstract thinkers as the height of humanity is part of our collective problems.

                        It‚Äôs not education that puts Jews at the top.  It‚Äôs nepotism, which started with middle class Jews caring for fellow Jews, even the poor ones, and bringing them up even just a couple rungs on the ladder.  You‚Äôre expressing the opposite sentiment here, the same thing that caused this situation, a disdain for poor whites. Also, what do you think all those female gender quota recruits and black athletes on scholarship are doing together in universities?  I‚Äôd never send a girl to a university.  There are plenty of middle class neighborhoods that are composed of service workers and trades people, with busy churches and big families, an hour away from any blacks.

            There‚Äôs a video of Peterson on YouTube in one of his classes I think with some even more devastating observations about IQ.  He actually raises the possibility that it may be nearlyimpossibleto find useful employment for those with IQ‚Äôs below a certain number.  He talks about someone with an IQ just under 80 that attempted to volunteer stuffing envelopes essentially, but the person couldn‚Äôt fold letters squarely or figure out the correct envelope to put the letter in and so on to the point that he was actuallyfiredas avolunteerfor making things worse on the job.

                Somebody, perhaps it was Peterson, asserted that people whose IQ is below 90 are unemployable because they cannot even organize themselves well enough to get out of bed in the morning and arrive on the job consistently on time. Most negroes have an IQ below 90.

                Two sides to that coin.  Right now the lights are dimming.  Folks are unhappy.  When they go out, they‚Äôll be desperate.  Only when you hit bottom, can you begin the process of recovery.  That process will entail many facets, but the main one will be a return to meritocracy in all areas essential to life.

                    The experience of the Soviet Union seems to suggest that baseless egalitarianism is far harder to root out than most other errors of thinking. It ground on for a whole murderous human lifetime and only ended when the country was falling apart and apocalyptic disasters like the Afghan war and Chernobyl were in the news you could hear on shortwave.Young children eventually learn that a taller glass of water does not necessarily hold more water than a shorter one. Perhaps it is this kind of realization that makes it possible to convince people of the idea thatsomehow, people really are all equally capable. If this is true, it may simply be that egalitarian ideology rests on people being able to sort of outsmart themselves. I think this is also what Orwell was talking about when he said that there are some things that are so stupid that only an intellectual could believe them.Much of modern science, such as Relativity, also seems to teach that the counter-intuitive is sometimes correct. Generalizing this idea though, is a mistake in most cases. This may also explain why you see so many scientists buy into the most ridiculous woke ideology. Engineers, who are more grounded in practical reality, tend to be much more conservative.Perhaps once fanatical egalitarianism takes hold it just runs to the point that it exhausts everything and everyone. Sadly the experience of the last 30 years suggests that the ruling elite is becoming more, not less fanatical in it‚Äôs egalitarian faith. Of course, this may mean that the West is collectively headed for a multi-nation civil war. Let‚Äôs not forget that the first consequence of the Bolshevik revolution was a civil war that didn‚Äôt end until 1921 and that theWhite Russians (anti-Bolsheviks) could well have won. Let‚Äôs be the White Russians(in all senses of that)and win this time!

                        One quibble to an otherwise outstanding analysis.I don‚Äôt equate the equalitarianism of the USSR with today‚Äôs equalitarianism in the USA.  If my understanding is correct, the USSR never assumed people were of equal ability.  They sent their best to the university and others to their trade schools.  There was no AA in the USSR.Where they made their biggest mistake is in their reward/renumeration for differing abilities.  So that a doctor would receive the same State payment as a crane operator‚Äîor a teacher in school, the same pay as a line worker in a factory.It was the old adage, ‚ÄúFrom each according to ability, to each according to need.‚Äù  This of course perturbs the economy.

                        Correct. And Grey wasn‚Äôt wrong. If the lights were going out on white civilization 110 years ago‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a pretty damn long-term slide.
If you think in terms of the meta-narrative the fall of the West is a long-term, multi-generational, multi-national problem. The stuff we‚Äôre talking about today ‚Äî the trannies, the queers, the nonwhite immigration ‚Äî is just the logical endpoint of the rejection of Christianity and the fratricidal slaughter of whites that began well over a century ago.

            The damage the phones have done is incalculable. I started teaching at the university level at Tier-Two schools when flip phones were the only game in town. When I left, iPhones were in every hand. In seven years I went from being able to assign parts of Kant‚Äôs ‚ÄúGroundwork‚Äù to needing to have PowerPoint on at all times just in case I needed to put The Categorical Imperative up there for the 10,000th time.They simply couldn‚Äôt remember anything. This was a decade ago. I cannot imagine how bad it is now. My own family is ruined. They are in their 40s and have their phones in their hands all the time. They are all women. It is impossible to have a discussion with them. They have no attention span whatsoever. To even the score, I have a male boss who tells me to do the same task about eight times an hour. He‚Äôs in his 40s too. I feel like I‚Äôm speaking to my grandfather. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll get right on that now, thanks.‚ÄùI walk around in a daze now. I cannot believe this has happened. I cannot believe I am living through this. It is going to be terrifying in a decade. Absolutely terrifying. We have killed ourselves off.Those of you in the know, already know that medicine in parts of the US has collapsed. It just ain‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs all been taken from us. Learn first aid. And more. Get books from the 1830s and start learnin‚Äô how to do things.

        A related argument can be made about opposition to immigration ‚Äì we don‚Äôt oppose immigration because the economic numbers don‚Äôt make sense, nor because they cook weird foods and wear funny clothes. Numbers and ‚Äúlogical‚Äù arguments about cultural enrichment, different perspectives or alleged cultural rejuvenation are irrelevant. We oppose immigration because our lands belong to us and nobody else. Our ancestors fought and gave their lives to preserve our heritage. Outsiders can go f*ck themselves.

                Do you think the Indians were tourists, or ‚Äúnew Americans‚Äù? Cincinnati used to be a very nice city, in my experience. It had a big German-American population from before the Civil War. Not sure if you‚Äôre referring to that or to German tourists, but I think the combination of old-fashioned German civic interest and Anglo decency and politeness had a very good impact on the city, until recent decades at least. I‚Äôm glad to know that someone else, in this case you, had a good experience there, at least away from the dot Indians. As with most cities in the West, I‚Äôve worried that maybe Cincinnati went downhill too. It had its rough spots, but I was impressed by it in the multiple times I was there years ago.It also had a great museum, the Taft, but I shudder to think what the ‚Äúmuseum studies‚Äù graduates have done with it. Hopefully it has been spared, unlike so many others.

                    They were not tourists but new Americans because their kids were all speaking English.im seeing that among Indians and orientals that their conception of being ‚Äúupper class‚Äù is to take up tennis or golf.wrt the Germans, I am referring to the locals. Where I‚Äôm staying is in an area called Montgomery. All the girls look like the girl on the Swiss Miss logo ha ha.lastly, yes I had a great time here and love the city and look forward to coming back next year.  I get that there are bad areas but it seems pretty easy to insulate oneself from the problems.

Ugh, that‚Äôs what I was afraid of‚Äìthe same pattern as in other cities.  Maybe you‚Äôve noticed the sculpted pigs around downtown?  A whimsical testament to how Cincinnati used to have a big pork industry.  With the new arrivals the streets will be adorned with other foul smells.

I think all White nations deserve their homelands. Other races can have the rest of the world, I don‚Äôt care. They can sort it out between themselves. I don‚Äôt believe that Whites need to dominate the world. Africa, for example, is just too much trouble. Ideally, it should be sealed off from the rest of the world and exist as a natural reservation.

                    You could be right. I‚Äôd don‚Äôt care which it is. But the dominance thing is a valid argument and smarter people than I have made it. But the white mind has to be very tough:Take up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîSend forth the best ye breed‚ÄîGo bind your sons to exileTo serve your captives‚Äô need;To wait in heavy harnessOn fluttered folk and wild‚ÄîYour new-caught, sullen peoples,Half devil and half child.Take up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîIn patience to abide,To veil the threat of terrorAnd check the show of pride;By open speech and simple,An hundred times made plain.To seek another‚Äôs profit,And work another‚Äôs gain.Take up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîThe savage wars of peace‚ÄîFill full the mouth of FamineAnd bid the sickness cease;And when your goal is nearestThe end for others sought,Watch Sloth and heathen FollyBring all your hopes to nought.Take up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîNo tawdry rule of kings,But toil of serf and sweeper‚ÄîThe tale of common things.The ports ye shall not enter,The roads ye shall not tread,Go make them with your living,And mark them with your dead!Take up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîAnd reap his old reward:The blame of those ye better,The hate of those ye guard‚ÄîThe cry of hosts ye humour(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:‚Äî‚ÄúWhy brought ye us from bondage,Our loved Egyptian night?‚ÄùTake up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîYe dare not stoop to lessNor call too loud on FreedomTo cloak your weariness;By all ye cry or whisper,By all ye leave or do,The silent, sullen peoplesShall weigh your Gods and you.Take up the White Man‚Äôs burden‚ÄîHave done with childish days‚ÄîThe lightly proffered laurel,The easy, ungrudged praise.Comes now, to search your manhoodThrough all the thankless years,Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,The judgment of your peers!

        Some e-righter on Twitter recalled the Solzhenitsyn passage fromThe Gulag Archipelagoin regards to Britain, and here is the passage:‚ÄúAnd how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?‚Ä¶ The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin‚Äôs thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If‚Ä¶if‚Ä¶We didn‚Äôt love freedom enough. And even more ‚Äì we had no awareness of the real situation‚Ä¶. We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.‚Äù

            So what‚Äôs the point to the quote? Do you mean English people deserve this or you saying that you support the people who,unlike in America,are actually physically doing something?Also, typical  American: the f*cking obsession with abstract nouns. The people in England are not fighting for FWEEDOM they are standing up for their people,their tribe.I would say that whenever anything bad happens in England there‚Äôs always some rightwing scumbag from the US gloating .We, in England,don‚Äôt do the same to you even though there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù regarding the ‚Äúgreatest country in the world evah‚Äù.

                john smith:  I cannot speak for anyone but myself, but I mourn what‚Äôs happening in England.  Love the people, the country, the history, and the heritage.  And spot on ‚Äì those who are standing up are not doing so for magic principles like freedom or free speech.  Whether they even know it or not, they are fighting for their people.  Would that more on the dissident right understood that instinctual, visceral reaction. It never ought to have come to this ‚Äì Enoch Powell was so very right.

                        That‚Äôs silly. There is always a hierarchy. I will always care for my wife and kids more than I care for you, and I will (likely) care for you more than some arbitrary white, who I will care more about than some arbitrary human.

                I would say that the advice given in that quote would apply equally to our tribe members located on both sides of the Atlantic. Our brothers on the eastern side have decided to be more active because although we‚Äôre both in dire straits, your condition is more advanced than ours. Give it time, we‚Äôll catch up‚Ä¶elections are coming.
Please, no hard feelings. We are in this together and need to be united. When we begin to Balkanize, emigrate, join your brethren here.

                    The United States is in far worse condition demographically. There is less room in Britain to seek out ‚Äúbetter schools,‚Äù to use the euphemism. It is odd to note that the only real recent resistance to the wide-open border and flood of humanity into the US has come from blacks afraid they will lose dey gibs. I admire my British brothers and sisters for having backbone.

                        Jack:  This.  The only ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô of being in AINO rather than England is more space, and all those unused guns we constantly hear about.  Demographically, England is still far more White than we are.

                            In an odd way the lack of space and guns may work in favor of the Britons since it will force action earlier into their displacement. The attempted Colony Ridges throughout the States likely will end in utter failure since the replacement populations will migrate to urban center with more individualized gibs and easier lives*. In Britain, the rubber hit the road when the populations in the towns and smaller cities started to be gifted with the brown hordes. People had seen what happened in London, Manchester and Liverpool, and the British State was far more generous with the gibs to the hordes in the hinterlands, which was inducement to stay put.Britain remains almost eighty percent white, the States is barely half and if I found that to be exaggerated there would be no surprise.*Another way in which space also works for us; the feds would love to force their foot soldiers to stay in the hinterlands, too, but it won‚Äôt be as easy here. Look for gibs to be dialed up to 11.

                                The black/brown/yellow hordes definitely prefer cities.  If Whites had any backbone and unity, it would be a simple matter to control the food supply.

                            A lot of the demoralization campaigns have given way to straight up persecutions. It is hard to tell if this is due to a belief the populations have been softened up to permit this or whether it is due to impulsivity. I suspect the latter.

                                I get the sense that when they decided to crack down on anti immigrant talk, and saw how little pushback there was to that,  then they moved on to the next item on their list they wanted to crack down on. ‚ÄúMisogyny.‚Äù If there isn‚Äôt any pushbback on that either, then it will be on to whatever the next one is.

                                    There is no doubt this is being done incrementally. Remember the old line about how trends started in California and spread to the rest of the United States? I don‚Äôt think it is due to California becoming such a dumpster fire, but the way things happen now societal trends start in Western Europe and spread to the States. New forms of oppression are test run there, tweaked, adapted, and then imposed in the US. Once the police start to go after ‚Äúracist posts‚Äù here, they also will transition to ‚Äúmisogyny.‚Äù And, no, the First Amendment does not matter and will be ignored.

                    I have come to hateSolzhenitsyn‚Äôs quote, because I have seen too many right wingers repeat it in the abstract, but then turn around and condemn the people acting out when the quote should be applied.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt resist and follow the law or you will end up in prison‚Äù
Isnt the whole point of the quote that they can‚Äôt arrest everyone?  That sufficient numbers can overwhelm the tyranny.
In order for the quote to work, instead of shaming people for ‚Äúbeing a fed‚Äù, they should be shaming the people who forever refuse to act.

                There‚Äôs a few levels to this, but what Solzy is trying to say, in essence, is better to die on your feet than live on your knees, and those people in the gulag realized this all too late.Apparently some white English guy, who was arrested for being part of the riots, or being mean online, was put in prison. As is the custom of spiteful and tyrannical systems, they housed the white guy in with Muslims, who quickly beat him to a pulp. (You will recall that January 6th political prisoners were housed with violent Latin gangmembers and black security guards and made to suffer by them.)My point, and Solzy‚Äôs, is that if you are led off quietly to this fate, instead of fighting back and possibly (probably) losing your life, you indeed deserve what you get. It‚Äôs a very harsh assessment ‚Äì who among us would choose to fight and die while there‚Äôs a small chance you could see your wife and kids again? ‚Äì but one‚Äôs sacrifice, compounded, could save hundreds and thousands more and grind a corrupt system to a halt.Life is brutish and unfair, and most white people, who have been living in Liberal comfort for generations, are not used to thinking in these terms, but our white cousins to the east ‚Äì the Russians ‚Äì have known it better than most. I just realize this; I am not goading the white Brits to risk death and prison for my amusement. I am half English on my dad‚Äôs side and am in horror of the Brown Orwellian state that Britain is becoming.I guess the question for everyone is, would I kill a few policemen who came to my door, to lead me to a prison full of people who want me beaten, raped, or dead too? Or would I chicken out? I don‚Äôt man, I don‚Äôt know.

You have to kill them before they come to your door in order to have a chance of a good life.
If you ambush them somewhere when your name has not yet crossed their mind, you at least have the ‚Äúchance‚Äù of getting away while striking a blow at the system.
Once they receive orders and come to your door it‚Äôs already too late.  Anything you stop will just be followed by endless reinforcements to the same door until you are dead.

                        That is the point, according to Solzy. The point is to take a few of them out knowing that you are doomed, which will make the authorities think twice about sending more men in. At some point, it becomes too dangerous even for the state. See: Cabrini Green.

            Solzhenitsyn was writing as someone who found himself on the wrong side of the Gulag‚Äîone who ‚Äúhad nothing left to lose.‚Äù Most Englishmen (like the people of Leningrad) see themselves as being on the right side of history, in Marxian parlance. They are very much like some of the characters in Orwell‚ÄôsNineteen Eighty-Four, believers in the system to varying degrees, who hope that by strict adherence to the woke orthodoxy (Parsons), careful avoidance of dangerous topics (Ampleforth), and enough money to escape the prole lifestyle (Charrington), they can avoid the worst. This attitude is heavily reinforced by the harsh custodial sentences being meted out to any dissidents by the Inner Party.

                Solzhenitsyn also remarked that many people didn‚Äôt lose their faith in the Party just because they were sent to the Gulag. They themselves were there by mistake, of course, and once Little Father found out about their unjust imprisonment, he‚Äôd set them free and leave all you traitors, saboteurs and Capitalist spies to be deservedly worked to death.

            i think the quote is appropriate for all freedom loving people.  the quote is a hindsight view of how free people should react to the chains of slavery.  additionally the quote describes the frailty of the captors.  the quote leaves out but implies the part about refusing to recognize a corrupt authority.  the hard part for any enslaved people is to come to the realization that abstaining from the authority think is complimentary to freedom.  acting on the idea of freedom in masse is the cure, it doesn‚Äôt take much, but it does require the refusal to accept corrupt authority.  if every government employee from town, city, county, state, federal cannot freely travel without threat the machine stops.

        ‚ÄúSinceThe Bell Curvewas published thirty years ago, the blank slate, fanatical egalitarianism and universalism have become so entrenched in elite thinking that dissent is now criminal in many countries.‚ÄùYou‚Äôre probably right but ‚ÄúThe Bell Curve‚Äù was pretty tame stuff. Scientists like Richard Lynn, J.P. Rushton, and Arthur Jensen, and philosophers like Michael Levin (‚ÄúWhy Race Matters‚Äù) have gone much further. You might argue that this ‚Äúknowledge for the sake of knowledge‚Äù is unimportant because it has had no impact on public policy. But it does matter because the sceptics and dissidents among us do need to know what the science indicates and what reasonable conclusions can be drawn. That the American black has an IQ a little over one standard deviation lower than then white IQ, and that his testosterone level is much higher, furnishes me with an enhanced understanding of what to expect in terms of behavior (impulsiveness, proclivity to violence, heedlessness of consequences). I also understand why there‚Äôs an ‚Äúachievement gap.‚Äù Academics like Rushton and Levin have been explicit and detailed about all this. Without this knowledge I would always think that I‚Äôm ‚Äúprejudiced‚Äù. that it‚Äôs the deprived environment of blacks that makes them what they are, that ‚Äúinstitutional racism‚Äù might be a factor, and that we all start astabula rasa. I might also succumb to the liberal virus of treating everyone as an individual, with no preconceptions about what to expect.

            Reason as a moral authority can only be a waystation to simply the will to impose our preferences. In other words, the human sciences can provide justification for rejecting the prevailing orthodoxy, but the justification for what comes next must either be our desire for it or some new religion that captures that desire.

                        The tribalism of intellectual elites is an important element of the system that divides the societies in the West. In the end the access to saloons is what many aspiring philosophers/political writers crave, especially those who were born into affluence, but for various reasons became ostracized by the ‚Äúpolite society‚Äù.It is also one of the defense mechanisms against dissent. A promise of redemption and re-admittance can successfully divide the opponents as those previously rejected will leap at any chance of attending the cocktail parties again. Others will see their new seat at the table as sufficient victory, promising to ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù better terms for the Little People (many DEI activists chose corporate sinecures to virtue-signal, while safeguarding the system). The Critical Theory actually discusses this co-opting tactic as a way to institutionalize the dissent as a part of the system (buy our merch to smash the Enemy, donate to our culture-war).After all, populism is a tool for achieving political ends. Nobody is seriously thinking about handing over the direct power to the pleb when engaging in rabble-rousing. While in the post-modern West empowering the rube is seen as heresy, it‚Äôs still forgivable when thepopularesremember that they belong to the elite at the end of the day. Class contempt is racism for the upper classes and they hate nothing more than the betrayal of their identity. You can play the advocate of ‚Äúthe People‚Äù as long as you don‚Äôt get any revolutionary ideas and invite plebeians to saloons.A true break with the ruling system is to recognize the old elites as the Enemy (in Schmittian terms) and prepare for a war to forcefully circulate a new elite into power, while co-opting the left-overs. The motives are less important, even selfish, greedy individuals can be useful to institute changes as seen in all revolutions.

                        In these cases, the idea of reciprocity may be helpful with the white elites who can be reached:
Most of the non-whites elites to whom you have bound yourself have more loyalty to the most stupid and violent of their race than to you. Look at OJ and Black Lives Matter.
They tell you to your face that you can never atone for your personal racism that you inherit from your whiteness. You will never be forgiven or spared. Listen to hate with which non-white women talk about the tears of liberal white women.

            Arshad Ali:  Science is all well and good, but it‚Äôs far more vital that people understand they do not need scientific and rational reasons for preferring one‚Äôs own people and civilization.  The sub-saharans and mestizos and asians who are overwhelming the West are not justifying their conquest by citing IQ scores (they leave that to the cuckservatard Whites).  They don‚Äôt apologize for their alien habits and ways that subvert everything the West was supposedly founded upon.  Their ethnocentrism is instinctual.  So, too, is all the defense we need:  Not that Whites are smarter or better, but Because We Prefer Our Own.  Because We Said So.

                We used to be able to say I don‚Äôt like so and so because I just don‚Äôt like his face.  As with me and Matt Damon.  Don‚Äôt ask me to explain it.  I just see his face and want to punch it.but people always do, and that‚Äôs a white problem lately. People have to get over this bourgeois bullshit of having to support every opinion with facts or some kind of scientific study.  Aargh.  The HBD crowd was always huge into that, along with the white nationalists (think Greg. Johnson) and unfortunately much of the DR.   It comes down to the fact that whites have been over educated ‚Äî or overly dependent on seeming educated or they wilt and then can‚Äôt spit out an opinion because, god forbid, they may not sound ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and being smart is the end be all of white existence today.fortunetaly we can still say I don‚Äôt like pizza or fish and not have to provide a scientific study as to why, at least among most people.  But I have seen white guys in social settings demanding a valid reason for not liking tacos or some girl over there or what have you.it points to a deeper sense of lack of confidence.  And that‚Äôs the crux of the matter.  Whites overall simply have no real confidence. Probably why so many young people are drawn to music from the 1980s which is when whites last had the public confidence to make great dance music or just great harmonic music.but as I always say, the road out of this hell is going to start with the arts.  It may be a long road, but when people who happen to be ‚Äúwhite‚Äù start making great art agin, it will trickle through society as a form of inspiration.  It always does.

                    Interesting post. If whites begin making great art‚Äìand music‚Äìagain, it will because we have rejected the revolting and repellent aesthetics of nihilism and diversity that now hold sway. And having rejected that aesthetic, we will have rejected egalitarianism and relativism into the bargain. Civilization, in that scenario, could be reborn.

                    The disappearance of good art/music followed cultural decline, it did not precede it. Likewise, if and when it returns, it will be following cultural renewal, it will not precede it.

                I won‚Äôt quibble with you on this and in fact you‚Äôve made this point before. But many white people are not this way. And those who are not might need some persuasion. And so some scientific arguments might come in handy. Intellectual armor.
Race realism is different to mere tribal or ethnic solidarity (though I have no problem with the latter). Let fact-based arguments speak for themselves.

        After reading about the Spanish Civil War I don‚Äôt think we can overcome the tyranny without some kind of belief system, a new religion, as the Z just wrote about. It can be the old religion if it gets it‚Äôs act together in the modern age and kicks out the  communists and other eglatarians.Franco would not have succeeded unless the organized Catholics were not already organized and in place and willing to fight.The Carlists being one of those groups.Our Christianity has been so feminized that there is little fight in it‚Äôs men at the moment.That can change.Or we get a new religion.I think that it will change given time.Fighting Christianity is not finished.We just need some hard times.

            The greatest Christian army ever gathered is here, poised to cleanse this chosen land of those who, having heard the gospel, refuse saving‚ÄîThe Irredeemable!

Y‚Äôknow, us.

Religion isespeciallysubject to ‚Äúdemographic reality.‚Äù In books and fantasy Christianity is many things, but out here among the actual facts of life, it‚Äôs a cult of anti-whiteness, a murderous dusky horde driven by traitors.

That the Bible doesn‚Äôt say to be that, and few white believers consciously believe it‚Äîor consider anyextra-salvificeffects of their acts‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt matter at all.

The migrant camps hum with prayer.

                This is a recipe for certain defeat and extinction. Out here in the hinterlands there are millions of white Heritage Americans, deeply Christian, who you‚Äôll need on your side in order to win. Shit-talking their religion is a sure way to get them to not join your cause, ever. So shut your big stupid pie-hole about how much you don‚Äôt like Christianity, unless you want American whites to share the fate of the Russian ‚ÄúWhites‚Äù, who also couldn‚Äôt quit squabbling with each other long enough to effectively fight the communists.

        When blogger Heartiste had his site the subtitle was ‚ÄúWhere Pretty Little Lies Perish‚Äù. As you‚Äôve pointed out Z, a great bulk of people prefer the pretty little lies they tell themselves until reality smashes them in the face, sometimes quite literally.The problem with guys like Sailer and Murray is the people who do read them are either heading down their path of understanding or have seen what they‚Äôre pointing out with their own two eyes. Certainly you living in Bodymore Murderland saw it. The Catch-22 is the people whoshouldread them won‚Äôt read them because the words they speak and write have bad ju-ju and will turn one evil if they read or hear them, or as the saying attributed to Winston Churchill went: ‚ÄúSome men stumble over the truth. They then pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and go on as if nothing happened.‚Äù

            One of the main problems with Sailer and Murray et. al. is that the emphasis has primarily been on the differences between blacks and Whites, and supposedly ‚Äòpure‚Äô rationality.  That‚Äôs why most HBD comment sections are filled with White apologists (because to prefer one‚Äôs own just ‚Äòbecause‚Äô is beyond the pale), as well as Jewish and Korean and other non-Whites that readily agree on black disfunction, but combine it with triumphantly preferring their own.  It‚Äôs not enough to accept HBD.  One must be pro-White.

Don‚Äôt want to play devil‚Äôs advocate but as the Derb pointed out ten or fifteen years back, the major difference is between blacks and everyone else, while the differences between non-blacks are a bagatelle in comparison (I‚Äôm using his words). In saying this I‚Äôm not questioning a pro-white stance.

                    You and I may know (or find persuasive) the vast DNA chasm between blacks and all other races (no Neanderthal, etc.).  But intellectualism does NOT matter in a fight forracial survival.  Just as the best propaganda is NOT what you find clever or witty, but what most stirs people‚Äôs emotions.  Derbyshire likes to say his Chinese wife ‚Äúadds salt‚Äù to the European soup.  I say the European soup was perfectly seasoned and tasteful on its own, and needed no other seasoning.

                It is a matter of ‚Äúbaby steps‚Äù.  Murray has been more successful than any of us in that he‚Äôs worked within a group of non-believers to get them back to that which their father‚Äôs and grandfathers knew wrt racial differences.  He‚Äôs walked a tight rope rather successfully in that milieu.I do not blame him for picking the low handing fruit of Black vs White.  To accept  just that is a big step in our present delusional environment.  His audience is different.  Here we preach to the choir so to speak and look at all the dissent within just our comments.

        ‚ÄúTherein lies the most important lesson to come from the HBD scene. Facts and reason can never overcome belief.‚Äù
99%. of people have never heard of these studies and those that have aren‚Äôt going to speak up for fear of losing everything.  The control of media and institutions matters.  The elite matter.  The opinions of the plebs are both malleable and of secondary importance.  Power is the only thing that matters. If the right people had control of the media we could be expelling foreigners and sweeping Jews out of oven trays within a decade.

            I see you come by your username honestly. But the Jews and oven trays bit is a bit much. It would be more than sufficient to establish a homogeneous, sovereign white homeland and, on pain of termination, make certain no Finkel ever sets foot in it. And it pains me to say that because, in many ways, I respect and even admire that tribe. Loose your flaming arrows.

        The HBD stuff is kind of beside the point. Because even if it weren‚Äôt true, the threats to our race and our civilization would remain the same. The ‚Äúgreat truth‚Äù is that once he is a minority (globally speaking he already is), nobody else is going to stick up for whitey the way whitey sticks up for others.  He will be on his own.

        That is what you are seeing in the UK. The people being sent off to prison for voicing complaints about immigration are not being punished for opposing public policy, but for violating official orthodoxy with regards to the human condition.It may have started that way but it isn‚Äôt that benign now. Assuming it wasn‚Äôt always so, this has become explicitly anti-white oppression throughout the West and specifically at the moment in Britain. This no longer is enforcement of a whacked-out ideology but a malicious program to ‚Äúeliminate whiteness,‚Äù which is code for cultural and eventual physical genocide. I hold particular contempt for the self-righteous bourgeoise there hurling the pejorative ‚Äúgammon‚Äù at those in rightful resistance to their replacement. The hallmark of totalitarianism is a populace willing to act as moral enforcers of the state, and these types in Britain, America and the rest of the West are merely following in the footsteps of the pigs who came before them. The British state and its official thugs would be overwhelmed without these unofficial enforcers.The official orthodoxy is not in regard to the human condition but in regard to the elimination of our portion of it.

            Yes, and the current Starmer regime in Britain is doubling down recently on accusing the critics of immigration as ‚Äúracist,‚Äù and it seems to be using NGO‚Äôs, the SWP, and Antifa as very effective, intimidating enforcers, along with the British MSM which includes supposedly ‚Äúconservative‚Äù rags such as the Telegraph.  Once again, they seem to be all reading from the same script.  And it is all towards eliminating the white British and their culture.  Relentlessly.DR people will condemn someone like Tommy Robinson, but he seems to have a large following among patriotic Britons.  There was an impressive patriotic rally in London a few days before the murder of the little girls which he was involved with, and I think that such a movement, if it remains peaceful, can gain traction.  Robinson should be treated with caution, but his following indicates a great hunger for real action.  Peter Whittle and his New Culture Forum also offer hope, especially with its encouragement of local groups of like-minded people.

                From what I gather, Robinson‚Äôs role is to redirect the ire from the tribe that created the problem to the pawns said tribe uses in carrying out its goals.  Refocus from the cause to the symptom.

                    That is the main criticism of Robinson from the right, but I think that the number of his ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù indicates that there is something afoot that is much bigger than him, which should be respected and supported.  Many of his followers seem to be regular, white, patriotic Britons.Maybe the biggest problem with the DR is that it disdains ordinary people like them‚Äìthese ‚Äúnormies‚Äù so to speak, who might not have completely ‚Äúseen the light.‚Äù  We have to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good, or however the saying goes.  The real, immediate threats are the massive numbers of immigrants, and what I‚Äôll call the Starmer regime, which reaches beyond Westminster.  And the people who were at that London rally were putting themselves on the line against those threats, in a peaceful way.I like the videos of one of Robinson‚Äôs associates, Richard Inman.  He‚Äôs in Northern Ireland, was in the British military, is devoutly Christian, and understands what the strengths of Britain were before the Blairite madness.  As he says, ‚ÄúBritain was a gentle, generous, peaceful, tolerant country.‚Äù  He emphasizes a peaceful movement, and speaks against globalism.  To me, that‚Äôs something that should be strongly supported.

                It is of note that the Starmer regime is expanding its state oppression to other areas such as ‚Äúmisogyny,‚Äù which some prudish she-minister has announced will be relentlessly suppressed right along with ‚Äúracism.‚Äù To belabor the obvious, the misogyny campaign never will include the chador because that would be racist. I assume battered women‚Äôs shelters will be expanded to include (white) females who are afraid they will hear something pro-masculine.Thanks for the information. I try not to opine much on the inner workings of the politics of other nations since I read so many bad takes on ours, so that about Robinson is duly noted. It seems somewhat analogous to Trump, in that he may awaken others regardless of his motivation/backers. State persecutions of public figures are intended to act as warnings, but they can backfire mightily. Here‚Äôs to hoping. The British State seems hellbent on making him into a martyr.

                Robinson believes multiculturalism can work, just not with Muslims. His activism grew out of watching the Pakistani (Muslim) takeover of Luton, his hometown. He‚Äôs defended Sam Melia, imprisoned for anti-immigration stickers. But accusations of racism reinforced by periods of imprisonment have led him to champion Britain‚Äôs colonization byIndians (Hindu), Africans, and most of all Jews. The latter now largely run his organization. He enjoys considerable working class support, but it‚Äôs become something of a grift. In between arrests, he‚Äôs become known for hanging out on beaches in Portugal, Spain, or Cyprus.

        I believe that Judeo-Puritanism will have to be greatly diminished in order for Western Civ to survive. And we may be about to witness this. About an hour ago, Alistair Crooke gave an interview where he described the insanely fanatical forces at work within the Israeli Jewish community. I won‚Äôt bother with the gory details, which you can hear for yourself over at Judge Napolitano‚Äôs website (Facebook). But you can‚Äôt help but think that no matter how unhinged these Jews are over their desire for a final Armageddon with their Mideast foes, America‚Äôs Judeo-Puritans are going to march into that gristmill shoulder to shoulder with them.

            Jews are going back to being just another semitic tribe in the region, with better tech. The European-Ashkenazi dividend is slowly running out as ‚Äútropical Jews‚Äù take over demographically. Zionism, a purely Ashkenazi attempt at emulating modern Europeans is coming to an end. What lies beyond may be some kind of Jewish Volkism that tosses out the secular nation-state in favor of a mystical Greater Israel.

            Why Judeo-Puritan?Because the British were Anglicans, a Masonic (Enlightenment) offshoot.King James of the KJ Bible was a certified Mason, not merely a Protestant.The Constitutional United States was the start of a breakaway Masonic Empire.The British Empire had already been converged by the first Parliament, followed a few years later by the Bank granted by William of Orange.(it is claimed ideas formulated by Weishaupt in Bavaria inside the Lodges were implemented in France. Tudor duplicity may have begun in similar fashion.)This is not to say that Masonry or the Enlightenment were evil in origin, quite the opposite, they were an attempt to rise above the Christian wars caused by this process of breaking away.The same problem existed in early Christianity itself, however; its nature as a carrier makes it quite easily converged, in any of its forms. ‚ÄúAs a carrier‚Äù means accepting the legitimacy of a stolen identity ‚Äì an identity stolenfrom us,and inverted.When we accept thatwe were first, the God of Creation (not of Vengeance) is ours, and Jesus was White-then the nature of the theft becomes apparent, the political coding in the Bible becomes overt, and belief in our race can be restored.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄìOf course, the Word of God. He left it in there so you could see what was done and how they did it.  How they stole it from us and revised it for themselves.

            I tend to disagree.  HBD as I see it, and practice it, is an explanation for much observed reality we are faced with today.  Yes, I agree with Z-man.  You need a emotional movement to desire change‚Äînot just an explanation for that desired change. Nonetheless an understanding of just why the society is failing in its ‚Äúgood‚Äù intentions I find helpful in prediction and avoidance.  I don‚Äôt need to see the tiger at the end of the path.

        Ultimately it is a fight for survival on several levels, individual, genetic (your kids future) and societal. All arguments about ‚Äúthe common good‚Äù are subconscious or deliberate attempts to deceive the enemy. And the enemy is whomever you perceive to be the most dangerous rival to your continued prospering.This has several implications: for loser men winner men from the local tribe are the most dangerous rival. Therefore they are the most hated. For women it is a win win situation; they get to mate, voluntarily or not, with the winners. Since loser men and desperate women are in power in the West, you get a state that is actively treasonous towards the heritage stock (loser men) and busy inviting in alien men for mating fights (women‚Äôs wet dream). This will not change until the old stock alphas do, at the very least, a Pinochet. Otherwise it‚Äôs onto status Dodo. No prizes for being losers here

        ‚ÄúOne side, the winning side, believes the human condition can be solved because they believe the cause of human conflict lies in the human mind and can therefore be eradicated.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs funny about this is their ultimate victory entails destroying the very conditions that allowed them to exist &amp; thrive in the first place.With the foreign races in the West there‚Äôs obvious benefits to subvert &amp; destroy the civilization but there‚Äôs nothing at the end of the road for these people besides martyrdom at the hands of the savages they worship.Every time I see Kmac talk about European individualism it pains me because I can‚Äôt help but note the comparisons to extinct species who became extremely specialized for an environment that eventually changed leaving them woefully unable to adapt.Belief needs to be a proxy for reason otherwise it‚Äôs a liability. You can believe completely batshit crazy things so long as it doesn‚Äôt cause you to behave in a self defeating manner. Before modernity it wasn‚Äôt that costly to have these utopian universalist views but not anymore. Universalism &amp; the Western morality which is obsessed with fairness is a weakness.The Right is obsessed with complaining about fairness but they‚Äôre denying basic observable reality. Wanting fairness &amp; meritocracy in society is defacto White supremacy in actual practice, very few brown people would be successful in such an environment. So much of the hostility towards leftists &amp; racial aliens is due to their alleged immorality, it amounts to crying about the reality that we‚Äôre not all the same.Most of the pro White crowd isn‚Äôt that far removed from the normies unfortunately. If I had a nickel for every time I saw someone complain about jewish ethnocentrism I‚Äôd be able to retire &amp; live comfortably for the rest of my days. The idea that jews are bad people because they love their own &amp; hate racial aliens reveals how childishly utopian so many on far Right are. The implicit argument is that they‚Äôre bad because they don‚Äôt embrace universalism like we do. Based on the behavior I so often see they seem to believe that complaining that the world doesn‚Äôt match their fantastical beliefs will somehow change things.One thing non Whites seem to understand far better than Whites is that at the end of the day might is in fact right, the world does not give a shit about feel good morality. Unless your morality happens to produce outcomes in concordance with reality you‚Äôre going to lose. Unfortunately a lot of normie rightists are completely fine with that, they‚Äôre the distorted mirror image counterparts of leftists in that they don‚Äôt care about reality. Just like their alleged political enemies they‚Äôre all too happy to martyr Western civilization while virtue signaling about their liberal morality.You see this everywhere, look all the talk about how democracy is great &amp; dictatorships are bad even though democracy in practice means the masses have zero say in how society is run. There‚Äôs no veritable proof any of these beliefs are actually good but they‚Äôre clung to even as it destroys everything. The real preferences of these people is dysgenic supremacy &amp; savage worship. You can see this revealed in comical fashion when costumed neo nazis publicly protest mutilating children. Those same conservatives who just a moment before were against child trannies suddenly lock hands with leftists &amp; side against the nazis. They think it‚Äôs better to have your kids mutilated &amp; damaged for life than be pro White &amp; hostile to jews. People like that are not even a lost cause but straight up subversive for claiming to be right wing.Unfortunately I think this leftist utopianism is hardwired in most Western Euros, they spent so long indulging fantasy while facing no consequences for it which essentially created the conditions that favored breeding the most fanatical people.  That does however take away some of the sting knowing the White population is collapsing, most of them would‚Äôve sided with the brown hordes against us.Fanaticism wins against reason but as Z always says reality doesn‚Äôt go away &amp; the current beliefs are a complete inversion of reality that will ironically forcefully reintroduce basic might is right morality. If there‚Äôs to be any Whites in the future they‚Äôll have to be fanatically ethnocentric &amp; utterly hostile to liberalism either directly or by proxy because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to be necessary to survive the brown invasion currently underway.

                To be fair there‚Äôs certainly willpower but there‚Äôs simply no way to channel it unless it involves leaving the West to create a new community.I‚Äôve seen the glowies up close &amp; personal during the tea party era, they were swarming every single non mainstream group both left &amp; right. That was relatively tame compared to today, now they can send an agent to associate with your group &amp; then go commit crimes without you even knowing about it to get you federally charged.There‚Äôs millions of us scattered across the country but if we group up they‚Äôre on us like flies on shit. That‚Äôs why I always say I‚Äôm actually looking forward to the government agencies becoming majority non White &amp; civilization crumbling. Their ability to keep a boot our necks requires competence &amp; technology both of which brown people are lacking &amp; incapable of maintaining, respectively.They want techno communism but also a brown population who is functionally retarded, they can have one or the other &amp; they made their choice by importing the third world.

                I think you forgot about the north going to war with explicit purpose of freeing feral negro slaves. Also even before that I wouldn‚Äôt count the brits nor their diaspora going around wasting resources &amp; White lives trying to free african slaves from arab slavers as racist either.There‚Äôs tons of anecdotes about Euros being sentimental towards savages before WWII. One of my favorite examples is Mussolini hiring a painter to make postcards depicting Italian soldiers helping negro babies which was done explicitly to prey on the people‚Äôs savage sentimentality to get them on board with invading Ethiopia.Having witnessed such sentimentality many times in many people it seems to come from this sort of sense of guilt of being successful which jews have exploited the hell out of for the purposes of subversion. It‚Äôs like humility taken to such an extreme that it becomes toxic.

                    That‚Äôs a fair point. However, even in cases where the white man endeavored to aid the savage, never did he regard the savage as his equal. Rather, he regarded him merely as a human being upon whom one should not prey. And that hardly passes muster for non-racism.

                        I swear I‚Äôm not trying to be arbitrarily contrarian but.. Now I‚Äôm not going fully disagree with you on this but I will say its not so black &amp; White. Many of those northern liberals really did believe they were equal just like they do today with, ironically, identical excuses for their condition. The classic ‚Äúif we just educate them‚Äù originated with them, the quakers in particular really believed they could be molded into being indistinguishable from Whites.Now even though they don‚Äôt deserve it &amp; they never changed one iota since that time with every generation of those people continuing to be shitlib to the max I‚Äôm gonna throw them a bone. The vast majority blacks they saw were freed slaves who headed north &amp; that was the creme de la creme of blacks &amp; they‚Äôre still used as a lie by omission to argue against the genetic basis for IQ. Thomas Sowell‚Äôs bullshit arguments against race &amp; IQ hinge on that &amp; have been repeated ad nauseam.Also there‚Äôs the christian afterlife angle, equal in the eyes of the lord &amp; we‚Äôre all the same in the afterlife yada yada yada. It‚Äôs not a stretch to say that those types have &amp; still do weaponize the universalism of christianity to shill for savages.Still let‚Äôs just say for the sake of argument that those wannabe israelites in the north didn‚Äôt believe humans are equal under the guise that they‚Äôre moldable clay that‚Äôs still a far cry from being considered racist.Still I care not what the mental motivation was I just care that White resources, even their lives, were being expended on ungrateful savages who, if given the chance, would wipe us off the map in a new york second.Another anecdote is president Adams using American (White) tax dollars &amp; supplies to help the Haitians genocide the French in Haiti.If I come off as overly harsh towards Whites in the past its because these people areconstantlytreated like infallible gods who dindu nuffin when in reality they laid the groundwork for hellscape we live in today. In addition in many cases, particularly the northern Whites, they were near identical to the shitlibs we have around today. This sort of stuff is rarely discussed &amp; it does nobody any good to run apologetics for evil men regardless of their race.Finally, to be fair the most cucked past Whites were almost always of a specific ethnic and/or religious background that constitute a specific set of subversive pseudo sub racial tribes but unfortunately those tendencies exist in seemingly every Euro population. To draw a contrast you‚Äôll never see jews willingly cede an inch of their territory or resources to savages on moral grounds like Whites have.The overall point is that this is a flaw that must be acknowledged &amp; dealt with because if it‚Äôs not I don‚Äôt think Western Euros have a future &amp; I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a controversial position to hold. Perhaps it is, I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm going to keep saying it &amp; keep providing evidence, of which there is copious amounts, to prove it because it genuinely worries me.That quote about allies attributed to Napoleon is very relevant in my opinion is precisely what I think is the greatest danger to the continued existence of Whites.‚ÄúWhat one should really fear is not a competent enemy, but an incompetent ally‚Äù-‚Äì Napoleon BonaparteAs much as jews were influential in subverting society they needed the consent of White masses to enact their anti White policies, we should never forget that.

White people go gaga for saving orangutans, it doesn‚Äôt mean they consider them their equals. You may call it benign racism, but it‚Äôs still racism. The Joe Sobran-quote comes to mind:Other races feel like subjects of Western power long after colonialism, imperialism and slavery have disappeared. The charge of racism puzzles whites who feel not hostility, but only baffled good will, because they don‚Äôt grasp what it really means: humiliation. The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn‚Äôt conscious of it.Also, the Civil War wasn‚Äôt fought with the express purpose of freeing Negroes. Lincoln was planning on sending them back to Africa, not give them human rights.

                        Next time we interact I will be sure to clear definitions with you first because I certainly don‚Äôt consider the word racist to mean viewed as unequal but even so you can refer to my reply to the other post to see my response to that.‚ÄúLincoln was planning on sending them back to Africa, not give them human rights.‚ÄùI was discussing the northern liberals generally not Lincoln specifically &amp; if you‚Äôre claiming his personal views were representative of the masses as it appears you are then I‚Äôll respond to that.I‚Äôm not usually the type to ask for sources but in this case I have to because I‚Äôve read a lot of literature &amp; online articles on the subject &amp; have had many discussions to the point that I can say with very high confidence that Lincoln‚Äôs motivation is wildly different than the citizens who supported the civil war.So I have to ask the you please provide evidence that all those northern churches &amp; abolitionist organizations were motivated to fight a bloody war on the basis of sending the negroes to Caribbean colony where I guess they would still be enslaved since that apparently wasn‚Äôt the whole point for them. Or really just any motivation other than freeing them would do actually.I think you‚Äôre going to be hard pressed to find anything to the contrary of what I said, just giving you a heads up. I am if course open to being proven wrong but there‚Äôs just so much evidence to the contrary that it wasn‚Äôt about ending slavery for those poor negroes.Now I know Lincoln &amp; all these other high profile politicians were motivated by monetary concerns &amp; preserving the union but I haven‚Äôt seen one piece of propaganda nor rally cry about either of those things from the northern citizens who agitated for the civil war. They were pretty damn clear about the fact they viewed it as a holy war to free black slaves, there was no mention of a colony, preserving the union or money.Having said that I‚Äôm sure that just on the face of it you can see how utterly ridiculous it would be for those people to be willing to die to send slaves to a colony. Neither did Lincoln rally the people about preserving the union so the northerners could continue to exist in the same country as the people they would shortly thereafter rape, slaughter &amp; whose homes they would lay waste to.That‚Äôs not even mentioning the fact that those people did the complete opposite of what Lincoln wanted after his death. They sure as hell didn‚Äôt behave in a manner consistent with wanting these people expelled from the country after the war. Some did to be sure but I strongly suspect those were the same exact people, mostly Irish were a completely racially separate group of people from the northern anglos, that were force conscripted against their will to fight for the north.All in all I‚Äôm not seeing it, feel free to provide evidence to the contrary but also keep in mind it‚Äôs also going to have to either prove everything that‚Äôs currently known about those radical groups in the north to be false or at least be so overwhelming as to make it clear they were a minority &amp; not the bulk of their demographic as all the evidence seems to suggest.

                                I presumed a level of knowledge on your part that I‚Äôm now aware doesn‚Äôt exist hence why I preempted a lot of things that I now understand that you clearly have no understanding of which did muddy the waters admittedly.I‚Äôll fix that now.Are you aware of abolitionist movement?  Rhetorical question, your argument hinges on being ignorant of it. I presumed you knew about that but apparently I was wrong. Here you go:https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/abolitionist-movementhttps://rmc.library.cornell.edu/abolitionism/abolitionists.htm#:~:text=Abolitionists%20believed%20that%20slavery%20was,and%20returning%20them%20to%20Africa..‚ÄúBut by the mid-nineteenth century, the ideological contradictions between a national defense of slavery on American soil on the one hand, and the universal freedoms espoused in the Declaration of Independence on the other hand, had created a deep moral schism in the national culture. During the thirty years leading up to the Civil War, anti-slavery organizations proliferated, and became increasingly effective in their methods of resistance. As the century progressed, branches of the abolitionist movement became more radical, calling for the immediate end of slavery.‚ÄùBringing Lincoln up in response to the nothern abolitionist movement is whataboutism, a deflection, which is why I responded the way I did.Also as an aside Lincoln shilled giving negroes the ability to vote for the express purpose of winning favor with the people you are claiming didn‚Äôt want to free slaves even though that‚Äôs exactly what they did after the war. This was documented, with sources, in Kevin Orlin Johnson‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Lincolns in the White House.‚ÄùAsking me about the Caribbean colony as if it‚Äôs a gotcha is hilarious, it‚Äôs clear you have no idea why I mentioned that. Yet again I was replying under the assumption you weren‚Äôt totally ignorant of the subject matter, this line of questioning demonstrates that.https://www.history.com/news/abraham-lincoln-black-resettlement-haitiBy the way, Lincoln‚Äôs resettlement plan? He wasn‚Äôt going force them, his plan was voluntary so he defacto wanted to free slaves &amp; unleash them upon the country &amp; that‚Äôs actually what he did in the states with the largest slave populations before he was assassinated. That was called the emancipation proclamation, you can google search that. That detail about voluntary resettlement is in the book I listed which isn‚Äôt filled with lies by omission like both your arguments &amp; the lolbertarian books you‚Äôre either directly or inadvertently sourcing information from.Anyway outside of that I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre stupid or intentionally employing sophistry which you‚Äôve been doing since the beginning of our exchange.You ignored every single thing I said that didn‚Äôt rely on knowledge of that time period. You made the implication that the citizens who were pro war were ready to die purely because they wanted to preserve the union which is patently absurd just on the face of it let alone when you get into the details. Again, this silly position hinges on either lying about history or being utterly ignorant about the motivation of the people themselves &amp; if you think a politician &amp; citizens on the ground who will actually be fighting that war have the same exact viewpoints you‚Äôre insane, no really. As if they union soldiers marched while chanting ‚Äúfor the economic advantages of preserving the union!‚Äù lol.You have to do this whataboutist position that lolbertarian frauds invented because a cursory glance at the virtue signaling abolitionists utterly destroys that argument.Show me the abolitionists talking about preserving the union purely for the sake of the union &amp; not because they wanted to prevent the confederacy to break off &amp; continue practicing slavery. You can‚Äôt because all they cared about was ending slavery &amp; in addition Lincoln‚Äôs personal motivations for preserving the union have fuck all do with the northern anglo‚Äôs obsession with equality for blacks.Also pulling this ‚Äúb-bu-but muh Lincoln‚Äù argument doesn‚Äôt magically wipe away the nonstop agitation for ending slavery that started from before America was even a country. The only reason preserving the union was a concern was because of the slaves, churches on both sides viewed it as a holy war because of the issue of slavery with the north believing the negroes were entitled to the same rights as Whites.You‚Äôre sitting here arguing about intent when it is a fact that these people did in fact unleash feral negroes upon the country &amp; belonged an abolitionist movement that explicitly called for them to be freed. This whole semantic argument conveniently ignores how they behaved after the war, do I need to provide a source for every single anti White thing they did after the war too? I should probably copy paste the reconstruction era Wikipedia article for you because I‚Äôm sure somehow you missed that too but I‚Äôm not going to, I‚Äôve indulged you enough as it is.Claiming ‚Äúoh but they didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äù even if true, which it‚Äôs not, they still did it which is the whole point &amp; is conveniently ommited from your shilling of these people.If you‚Äôre trolling me then I give you credit for dragging me into the weeds this far, well done. If not then I question your sanity. Pooh poohing all the subversive equality bullshit these people did because they cannibalized their pet negroes in a survival situation is both batshit crazy &amp; incredibly stupid. If I that‚Äôs the bar for what you consider racist then we‚Äôre currently living in a White nationalist utopia right now, we‚Äôre winning bigly if that‚Äôs the standard lol.By your logic those Whites in marthas vinyard are full blown nazis for calling in the national guard to remove spics even though they wholeheartedly support anti White policies just like the quaker cucks you‚Äôre falling over yourself to defend.Next you‚Äôre going to say mudsharks who abort their niglets are actually based because they killed a negro, that‚Äôs right in line with the schizo logic you‚Äôre employing.You got a lot of mileage out of this, credit where it‚Äôs due but that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm not gonna read anymore of your fallacious rebuttals nor will I respond to them.

Yep, my entire life as a young boy, say a bit over 60 years ago, such ‚Äúracist‚Äù talk was acceptable and common at the dinner table.  Whether the foreign side of my facility or the heritage American side, it made no difference‚Äîand I might note it did not simply revolve around Blacks.

        I just viewed the depressing documentary ‚ÄúThe Fall of Minneapolis.‚Äù I used this URL:https://rumble.com/embed/v3tdi8y/?pub=4Granted it‚Äôs from a certain viewpoint; even so, it well illustrates how Egalitarian ideals can grow out of control. Were the events following Floyd‚Äôs death organic or fanned by opportunists? Some combination, I‚Äôd guess. One fact that jumps out in the documentary footage is that it was non-Blacks participating in much of the protest and/or violence.The events of May 25, 2020 continue to spread their ripples. The Radical/Progressive Left made great strides out of this and similar movements. If consolidating political power is the goal, abrogating long-held norms of legal procedure and trashing the lives of four police officers who apparently were just doing their jobs according to procedure is a small price to pay, isn‚Äôt it?It‚Äôs not out of the question that Tim Walz will be a future President.

            Blacks largely did black things and mostly looted during the Summer of Floyd. The main takeaway was how seriously damaged whites, particularly women, are psychologically and why you can write off so many of them as trustworthy. In fact, due to their higher intelligence, they pose a greater danger in a sense. A scene from Atlanta that really stuck was a bunch of looting blacks complaining about the white girl setting fire to a Wendy‚Äôs and how that might reflect badly on them.

            Like many millions of AINO proles, I was raised not to be a ‚Äúracist.‚Äù And for many years, if I‚Äôd bothered to think about it (which I rarely if ever did) I qualified as a colorblind civnat. Yet here I am with all of you. So I have some personal experience with crossing the great divide from normieland to the DR. And it was primarily the behavior of the ‚Äúleft‚Äù which pushed me over here, not any charts or graphs, however true, about HBD. So if even those events of the Summer of Floyd were not enough to rouse normie from his propaganda induced stupor and see the threat to his own race and therefore to himself, then brother, probably nothing at all is.

        I‚Äôve stopped listening to Ramz Paul because in one of his broadcasts he says he is not a white nationalist. He jokes about  blood tests and then sarcastic asked if whites would deport Clarence Thomas and Ron unz.up to then he would say stuff like we need our own homeland.(now I‚Äôm not sure who he is referring to with that 1st person plural pronoun)he would say that the head of the adl should be deported. And blacks behaving badly should be deportedbut basically what you are left  is civic nationalism: citizenship based on behavior and stuff you say. If you can‚Äôt deport all non whites but just the ones that say stuff you don‚Äôt like then what‚Äôs the differs between you and Ben Shapiro?I get the feeling that keeping readership listenership is more import to some than consistency .maybe I‚Äôm not understanding Ramz position.

            He‚Äôs always been a flip flopping chameleon. I don‚Äôt mean to come off like a hard ass but he‚Äôs always been soft, he‚Äôs very effeminate &amp; slimy.I used to enjoy his short videos but as soon as that came to an end &amp; he only did streams I noticed that about him right away since he wasn‚Äôt just doing a bit &amp; was being himself. That was a rather prescient observation given he would go onto become indistinguishable from a catty woman.I have to admit I did find it funny when he piled on with TRS attacking Andrew Anglin right before wuflu hit &amp; then he immediately turned on them for supporting lockdowns. The irony was he was in full agreement with Anglin on that in addition to many other things- at least at the time anyway. That was the moment he burned every bridge with White Nationalists &amp; decided he was a pro White lolbertarian &amp; started streaming with styx.Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs continued down the civcuck path but defending the jew Unz who wants infinite latino immigration to drown out Whites? I knew he was regressing but that‚Äôs pretty extreme.

                Most of the big names in HBD did. Most people in blogs like this did not. It might be an age/generational thing. Most of the HBD ‚Äúluminaries‚Äù are in their 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. Some are in their 80‚Äôs. Most people in blogs such as this tend to be GenX and younger. There is an overlap between HBD and alt-right. But it certainly does not map perfectly.

        To the best of my knowledge, HBD has never addressed the implications of its strong version ‚Äî that it is just the materialistic version of Calvinist Predestination. If one knew the state of the universe at any point in time, he could (in theory) calculate its state at any other point in time, since free will is an illusion.
Those of us who think the consciousness (soul) is something other than material never have to deal with that, but we do run headlong into the idea that HBD tells us just tendencies, modalities, a slippery slope into civic nationalism‚Ä¶

        Mind, body, soul. Truthfully, I used to be skeptical of the soul part. Hence my long struggle with the Trinity (fairly recently resolved, it seems), my first life as a STEM machine, etc.I think that‚Äôs because, in my readings, will was always portrayed as a more or less mental faculty‚Äî a conscious intention. You have the idea, and your will is what imposes it on matter. Even ideas like the id or the subconscious come back to the mind. Psychology, obviously.It was coming to see will as spirit, or soul‚Äî as something separate from the mind, mysterious, not ideal in essence‚Äî that made the difference for me. Whether it‚Äôs true or not, it makes more sense to me, solves a lot of problems. Mind, body, soul; Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Not mind, body, animal mind; mind, body, error; or something like that.I think the trinitarian view also has a moderating effect. Cosmic RPS, I call it. Your mind isn‚Äôt 2/3, and so dominant. There are checks and balances, for instance, will can run into reality rather than being the reality-making mental faculty, the mind doesn‚Äôt always dictate, etc.

        ‚ÄúSmarter, not harder‚Äù is both hereditarian and remedial. The forces arrayed against us are formidable, much like a herd of buffalo. And attacking the problem via an appeal to sanity is simply a slow death. Can anyone be talked out of Stage 4 cancer? Only in your dreams.

        Another lesson from the twilight of the human sciences is that knowledge for the sake of knowledge is a dead end.
This is not quite right because it‚Äôs not always possible to know, in advance, which kinds of knowledge will ultimately prove useful to humans. General Relativity seems fairly useless but GPS doesn‚Äôt work right without it ‚Äî not to mention Special Relativity. It might not even be a stretch to say that most useful human knowledge came about this way, oftentimes motivated by religion but not by practicality.

        If the West is to survive, it will be due to those who will it so and use any means necessary to prevail over those determined to turn out the lights on civilization.-This is the central question of political philosophy posed by both Plato and Aristotle ‚Äî how does Man achieve a coincidence of justice and power?In Plato‚ÄôsRepublic, the answer is to be ruled by a guardian class with total power, yet selflessly dedicated to truth. Of course this necessitates the ‚ÄúNoble Lie‚Äù to keep the rubes on board. In Aristotle‚ÄôsPolitics, the problem is presented as the problem of the ‚Äúslave by nature.‚Äù The ‚Äúnatural‚Äù slave is unable to govern himself by reason, therefore he must be directed by one more intelligent than he. Of course, if he was intelligent, he would recognize his own lack of intelligence, and voluntarily be directed; but since he is unintelligent he must be ruled by force.Of course, anyone can rule by force. The British Empire of the Enlightenment ruled by force; so did the Mongol hordes. Everyone who exercises force is going to claim that he is justified.Christianity pronounces the problem of the just and intelligent use of force insoluble due to the Fall of Man, and places the answer to the question in the hereafter.

        The only justification needed will simply be the desire to make it so.ive always said we could solve many of the problems we have if only a few million white men wanted to get some things done:women to have absolutely no public voiceall non whites out of North Americathis would provide the raw material to build, rediscover new era of human excellence. without the above, I just don‚Äôt see a future for the world let alone our people.but people need reasons to do everything. Even Rome said they were spreading civilization and law and order to the world to justify empire and conquest. Although they also said the ‚Äúglory of Rome ‚Äú was something in itself too.i think phrasing things in terms of layers of responsibility and piety could work. I see ‚Äúracism‚Äù as white piety. And a racist as a pious white. But besides that I‚Äôm out of ideas. Also, god could pull a rabbit out of his hat who knows how things will shake out.

Racism is a meaningless term, or rather has been defined by our enemies to be used against us.  To use such, or defend against such, is to immediately cede to them the high ground in any argument.  It is not possible to redefine the term.  Do not do so.  I don‚Äôt have a good substitute, but I like Taylor‚Äôs use of ‚Äúrace realism‚Äù for now.

                    Well that brings up the problems with Christianity and the great commandment to love your neighbor as yourself.  The Jews never fell for that.  But then there‚Äôs a related question in Scripture:  Who is my neighbor?  The answer seems to be, well, everybody.  But that runs up against basic biology and the nature of life.  Plus to love everyone is to love no one.

                        I‚Äôm not quite sure I understand the question. In my analogy, your race is your family, the neighbors are the brown guys.
‚ÄúRace‚Äù is a vernacular term with a rather vague boundary, but it is quite real. You can tell a Dane from a Swede by their DNA, and only seventy years ago, the Swedish Social Democrats were able to name ‚Äúthe Swedish race‚Äù as their country‚Äôs most important asset.
And yes, of course you prefer your own family to mine, but it‚Äôs concentric circles of love, with your family at the centre. Racism starts at home.

        Gravity always wins.  However, I‚Äôve been enjoying the concern trolls trying to convince everyone that they‚Äôre, ‚ÄúLike, totally MAGA, but Harris is so gosh darn charming and look at all the good press she‚Äôs getting!  Trump has too many flaws, so I‚Äôm thinking Harris‚Ä¶‚Äù blah blah blahfor vote fraud to work, and maintain the illusion of legitimacy of the current regime, the ruling class needs two things: volunteers and real voters.  Both of these require enthusiasm.The Zerg Rush media onslaught is losing steam.  Harris gave what was supposed to be a serious policy speech in front of about twelve supported, 74 staff, and 130 media toadies.  No Bon Jovi, no crowds.Biden‚Äôs basement campaign in 2020 was meant to reinforce covid hysteria.  And as a geezer, he was on the verge of death as it was. They don‚Äôt have that this time.Like the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù thing ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs talking about‚Äù, but nobody actually has, marketing and gaslighting can only get you so far.  Like an overhyped movie, people catch on, and they don‚Äôt show up.
