        Sports as a whole operates on an illusion, an illusion that the people on the field somehow represent you, your family, your city, your university. This foray into far left politics has shattered that illusion for many people, I used to be a huge NFL fan, I followed every player on my team including the training camp bubble players.Today I couldn’t care less, I don’t hate sports by any means, but I also can’t bring myself to spend time watching people who not only don’t represent me, they hate me.Sadly, I have friends who are STILL following the NFL and MLB. I’ve talked to them and asked them if it feels a little pathetic to spend hours and hours watching people who hate you. They just answer that they don’t care about their politics. Boomer-con is a state of mind more than an age I suppose.

            Re: escapism, the phrase ‘the wicked flee when none pursue’ seems increasingly applicable, which makes me uncomfortable. Don’t want to see my people in that light, but I’m having a hard time figuring it any other way.

            Agree. It’s impossible to view the whole thing as an amusing distraction when things have become so deadly serious. And when it’s clear they are on the other side. Baseball could keep going during WWII because the players weren’t repeating Tokyo Rose’s talking points.

            I think a lot of us grew up playing these sports and it was cool/ fun watching those at the pinnacle, play. But as many – particularly the nfl and nba have become almost totally negrofied, now coupled with insane levels of negofilia, blm bullshit and White cucking to beat the band, what rational person would give a flying F? What; our negros are better than your negros?

I’ve talked to them and asked them if it feels a little pathetic to spend hours and hours watching people who hate you.The bandwagon effect is real, and a lot of the true believers will stop watching after they realize no one cares about sports by the water cooler at work.

                Changing well established habits especially one’s thought pro civic is difficult especially for somewhat conservative normies. It will take time.That said the amount of time it is taking is surprisingly little given how ingrained sports are in our culture,

            Our side doesn’t care about the oppo’s politics, but the other side sure cares about the politics of Chick-Fil-W, the Boy Scouts, WalMart, etc. Who’s winning? You can’t win the war when you refuse to even show up on the battlefield. And, that, is much as anything, is why America died. The villains were totally committed to victory at any cost and the good guys couldn’t even be bothered to put up a resistance.

Hey man, normies just wanna grill and chill…besides, there’s a lot to look forward to this Fall – corn mazes, hayrides, and pumpkin picking, as long as you’re wearing your state-mandated face diaper!

            Just telling them that they’re watching “people who hate you” probably isn’t a severe enough damnation of what they’re doing.
What you probably should be telling them is that they’re spending their time and money supporting people who want to destroy the country.
It’s like it’s 1980 …… you’re an American watching the Olympics – and you’re rooting for the Russians to win hockey.
What kind of complete a-hole does that make you – if not an outright traitor?

        I dunno how much longer this can go on.  Every day I wake up, there is another slap in the face.This morning I woke up to read about that wine soaked old bitch, Nancy Pelosi. She broke quarantine rules that she signed into law to get her hair done. When she got busted, and ended up in the news for it – she wants to sue the salon for going public with it.Every day, I see shit like this and have to stifle myself from saying things like, “Somebody should put a bullet through that cunned stunt…” I can’t because some idiot will scream that I am espousing violence – and everyone knows you simply CAN’T do that!!!!I am beginning to disagree. If somebody puts a bullet through Nancy Pelosi or one of these other hacks… I am buying a round for the house.This particular Saxon is beginning to hate again.

            There truly needs to be a special place in hell , or facsimile on earth, for such a vile human being. All her incredible wealth, privilege, and power. and this monster throws a small business woman under the bus, with lies no less.They inflict financial harm and ruinous policies on her and rather than have an embarrassing episode, attempt to ruin someone.God damn her.

                I’m actually somewhat impressed with Nancy P’s latest escapade.  I mean I didn’t think she could do anything to make me hate hermore. Yet somehow she has.  Remarkable woman, truly.

            I’d be willing to bet that hair salon owner was a Democrat who got bitch-slapped by reality. She’ll move out of San Francisco (her words), but end up in Nevada or Arizona…where she will continue to vote for Democrats.

                Usually, they have to identify the prep.  But that was done almost immediately and was handed to them on a platter.  So where are they now?  Yep, strange that such a low life could disappear.  But as you intimate, perhaps there is not that much effort in the finding.  How long before they had Timothy McVeigh in custody?

                    So where are they now?


The MAGA-killer is by now safely ensconced in the BLM/Antifa safehouse network with a weekly cash stipend, burner phone, and runners for groceries and Riot Ribs.
BLM/Antifa probably have tacit agreements with the local mosques so they have additional options for hiding this guy in a pinch.

I saw one guy take a selfie with it in the background.  I can’t stop wondering how much anger is bubbling below the surface and what it’s going to take to set it off.

        I don’t give a shit whether they play or not. My alma mater is a famous football power…but it is also a politically correct shit-hole which requires incoming freshmen to take neo-Marxist indoctrination courses. Has anyone noticed that the growth in the number of these courses correlates pretty well with the growth in football coaches’ salaries? And why should I watch ignorant Bantus with no business near a college campus running around in my team’s laundry? I’m out. I’m not watching. The addiction is gone.

        Another surprising one was the NHL. The league is 99% white and the fans are 99.5% white. There is more non-white (cherokee) DNA mixed in at a kkk meeting.

They still decided to cuck and cancel their games, at the behest of the handful of mulatto players.

I hope all pro sports sink and fail this year. NBA and NHL ratings are down 20-30% compared to last year’s playoffs, according to sports media watch. NASCAR is shitting the bed too.

                    A chapter of history that I keep meaning to read up on. But I think I can guess the main outcome immediately:Haiti became, at a stroke, master of her own fate. As non-whites were expelled, immediately engineers and scientists of color (EASOC) set about modernizing infrastructure and industry. Contrary to what standard scholarship believes, Haiti was the first country to industrialize. Of particular note was the success of EASOC in developing the first transistor – almost 150 years before Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley.Today, Haiti is known for it’s immense contribution medicine, civil engineering, mathematical physics and computer science and boasts an economy that is estimated to be equal in size to the UK, US and Uganda – another non-white success story.

                        Been readingFacing Racial Revolution – Eyewitness Accounts of the Haitian Insurrection. It’s a collection of first-person accounts of the Whites who lived through the different stages of the revolution. Interesting in a number of ways.
Interesting to note that the French Revolution spawned two separate genocides, in the Vendée and in Haiti. Yet, so far in my reading of this book, the editor cannot bring himself to use the word.

Yes, for all the good scholarship has done, sometimes one just wants to call a spade a spade.

Haiti acquired a great deal of advanced science… but then whites showed up again and stole all the science.  After the white ships were loaded up with crates and crates of science there was no more left for the native scientists to use.  That is why haiti is in a sad state today.

            How long will we have to pretend these big strong thugs are such shrinking violets afraid of whitey. Listen to the “Rock” in the news today. All his family are covid victims along with his litany of other obstacles that he, and only he, had to overcome.The NHL lost me years ago before all the woke crap. Overly padded bigger men crashing around on the ice.

                Athletes like the “Rock” honestly believe that Beer Flu is simply hanging around in the aether or phlogiston waiting to get them, so of course they will act like a bunch of Muscle Marys during any discussion of Beer Flu.

                My parents were huge hockey fans back in the 70s when I was a boy.  One of my first memories is of the Stanley Cup playoffs the Flyers won in the mid 70s.  The last ice hockey game I watched was in person in the early 2ks. Two players grabbed each other’s shirts and cocked their fists like they were about to sucker the other one.  They stayed in that position for about 8 seconds waiting for someone to see them and the camera to start panning to them, as the camera panned over to them, they started “fighting”  FAKE AND GAY.

                    I used to play with a guy who had a pretty good career in the NHL- he told me that fighting where two guys were mad enough at each other to actually fight happened about as often in hockey as in other sports- the vast majority were more or less fake, that is, the reason was fake. Once the fists started flying it could get real. Oh, and often one could find the two goons sitting together at the bar later that night.

        College sports should be mostly eliminated and replaced with junior leagues akin to the baseball minor leagues. Dimwit semi-professional athletes have no place in colleges. Of course, most current college students have no place in college either.

                I’d also argue that the corruption in college hockey is less evident.Also the players don’t seem to hate the fans. Two years ago, after UMASS beat Notre Dame to advance to the Frozen Four, for the first time in program history, the fans lingered in the stands in Manchester, and the team and coaches came out to mingle with the long suffering supporters. It was a great moment that seemed genuine. I couldn’t imagine that happening in hoops or football.

        I went to the range with a friend this weekend, where incidentally you don’t have to wear a mask, and I asked him if he was still planning on watching football. He’s always been a season-ticket holder. He is. He said “I know they hate me but I enjoy it”. What can you do with these people?

                You actually do have a point there because I do find my refusal to watch any new TV movies or read books written and the last half-century have made it difficult for me to have normal conversations about modern ‘culture’. I’ve always been a bit of a weirdo but when I was a bartender I did watch one of the Real Housewives so I would have something to talk to the women about and football so I’d have something to talk to the men about.

                    There’s not a hit show in the past two decades that I am familiar with.  Even movies I used to enjoy are now too irritating because of the actors’ politics (Tom Hanks, anyone?).  My kids have both criticized me for their alienation from pop culture, and at the same time thanked me because they see how incredibly stupid most of their peers are.

There are a raft of actors and directors that I find so vile that I simply can’t sit there and enjoy any project that involves them. And that’s aside from the woke progressive messaging that is unsubtly shouted in my face in most shows. (Oh, another stunning and brave gay couple? Another evil White man oppressing a person of color? What a surprise.)

                I still try occasionally to watch TV.  Someone recommended a movie called “District 9” as something decent and worth watching.  The anti-white was subtle, but it was there.  It takes place in South Africa and there are a bunch of blacks in the movie, but all of the psychotic evil-corp militaristic morons are white.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  They made sure there was not a single bad black guy. Even the criminal Nigerian gang were not portrayed as badly as whites. They were pyschos for the sake of being psychotic.These people LOVE pushing blacks as our bosses or even God himself in movies.This kind of stuff just jumps out at me. I can’t suspend belief because they can’t help themselves but make their shit unwatchable to anyone who is even remotely aware of what they do.My ad-blocker recently stopped working on YT and now every other video has this black woman jumping up and down with the camera zoomed in on her face. I think she’s jumping for car insurance.  Then there’s the Stacey Abrams commercial begging for money and then there the Adam Schiff commercial with them begging for money. They love putting nothing but blacks and jews in your face.

                        It wouldn’t be the first time some leftist tried to portray a right wing thing negatively without realizing it’s still intrinsically more compelling and attractive that whatever gay critique xhe had in mind.  The movie is good, maybe it was an accident, but it happened

I recommend “Elite Squad” (from Brazil) as a well made unabashed right wing movie though. The sequel got jewed up but the first one is GREAT


Now excuse me but I need to go return some videotapes

                        Well, I don’t know much about the culture of South Africa or the Boers.All I know is that all of the bad guys were white. They were unnecessarily bad too.  That jumped right out at me like a crazed white boy just dying to whip a black slave 1/2 to death on the slightest pretense in an average American slavery movie. It’s not like the movie was all white either.  Of course, the hero of the movie is a peaceful alien who is outraged and disgusted by the white men performing experiments on his fellows and just wantonly killing them.

                        If you want a good (IMO) spoof on the diversity charade, watch NetFlix “Lilyhammer”.  Near as I can tell, it’s some sort of combined effort of Norwegians and Americans at a TV series.  Lots of mixed subtitles, English and Norwegian.Plot is about an American Mafia type who gets relocated in Norway as a “refugee” by the FBI witness protection program.  He begins to own the place in the second episode because he’s an American wise guy—a wolf among sheep, so to speak.  Every episode has a dig at Norwegian cucks, and their attempts to integrate refugees into Norwegian life and culture.  The picture painted is anything *but* supportive of the effort.Not bad.  My suspicion is that Netflix has bought any number of foreign TV shows for presentation to their now imprisoned American audience.  And they are often not the same tripe as we produce here.

                        I didn’t think it was terrible or that it was specifically anti-whte, although it does have anti-white overtones.  I don’t think it treated blacks especially well. The Nigerians are a bunch of criminals. They were otherwise just part of the background, mostly.I can see the anti-universalist aspects of it, but it also reeked of ‘humans bad, especially whites’ Avatar thing.It seems to me that the good guy of the movie is the guy who flies away with the mothership at the end and who, presumably, is going to return and destroy the humans.People are saying I’m getting it wrong. Maybe I should watch it again.

                    Just today I had a friend text me out of the blue to tell me how much he hates the new, black “Jake from State Farm”.  In the original commercial Jake was a slovenly white guy.  Now he’s an affable, humble, uber-capable black whom the white folks slobber over.  The overt messaging in commercials is yet more straw heaped upon the camel’s back.

            People are usually amazed when I tell them that every Browns game since the “expansion” has been sold out, and keep in mind one of those seasons they went 0-16 (and that probably wasn’t even the worst season to watch).  These people have apparently never heard the term “sunk cost”, but yeah if they’d convinced themselves to blow thousands of dollars a year to freeze to death to watch a crappy team lose, then it’s probably not that much more of a leap for them to put up with black millionaires tea-bagging them as they walk into the stadium.

                I saw an article yesterday that the Buffalo Wild Wings locations in Cleveland are selling a season pass for $750.  It comes with a reserved booth for every Browns game with seating for four, 30 wings, fried nachos and free soda.  The idea is to get people who normally go to games and can’t go or tailgate because of Covid restrictions.  I bet they sell out.

                    Someone needs to explain to me why, cramming people into a booth at B dubs is somehow less contagious than having them go to the stadium. Even if I bought into all this nonsense which I don’t it’s just seems really stupid to me.

                        I think we’re prone to pointing out the stupidity of the rules as if that’s an accidental flaw.  I suggest that the stupidity of the rules connects to the primary PURPOSE of the rules…
We are made to look like fools and we behave like fools and no objection we can have is deemed relevant to anyone that matters.  Our acceptance of this state of affairs is what is important.

        Paradoxically, the collapse in television viewership may save these sports from their black players. If the stands were full, the fans could boo when the players take a knee or make some idiotic gesture. There would be social proof that normal white people resent this stuff.Don’t discount the games would be disrupted, too. It almost would require projectiles full of piss being thrown at the players, coaches and refs to remain a patriot in good standing if one is so inclined. An argument could be made for making those piss projectiles into Molotov cocktails to show love of ‘Murica. Expect security to be off the charts and oppressive because the schools know this, too.Sportsball is dead in the long run for professional franchises. The college versions will limp along a bit longer until the fan base turns mostly hostile. These are positive developments.

        I grew up a fan in the most storied rivalry in college football, Ohio State/Michigan. I’m still not so cynical as to believe that everything about the hype back then was fake. Schembechler &amp; Hayes both seemed admirable men who were sincere in trying to better their players while winning games and their negroes were NABALT’s for the most part.Fast-forward to the John Cooper era and the wheels had entirely come off. Lots of wins but not even a pretense of character recruiting, concern for grades or criminality. With a couple of NABALT exceptions like Robert Smith (pre-med, later MD) under post-Cooper coaches like Tressel (scandal-mired in his own right), the players are just as awful as any other major team or conference.And Michigan has seen a similar moral decline in its coaches and players on a similar timeline.College football since at least the 1990s has been one of the most destructive influences on young White men (and many unfortunate White women as well) in terms of negrolatry, distraction and the over-selling and over-pricing of the “college experience.”Team sports in general now are a cancer. I’ll watch a little baseball or hockey but it’s mostly (((tricks))) in the end – shekels, consumerism &amp; faux Americana.

            I had season tickets to OSU football from 1972 to 2010. As Professor Emeritus, I still get solicitations to buy a season pass.In general I thoroughly enjoyed the games and the hoopla around them. Much of it was the comradery, the tailgating, etc. But eventually it got old, a nine hour day, and a 55 mile commute each way.In the stands one can just enjoy the spectacle, and need not consider who is on the field. On TV the blackness on the field, and the disdain of the players for the fans becomes painfully obvious. The in-your-face hostility of blacks towards whites completely destroys what interest I have in either college or professional football.Last year, the Ohio State athletic department actually lost about $10 million on a budget of over $200 million. This year will be an unmitigated financial disaster.One problem is debt. Ohio State borrowed almost $500 million to upgrade Ohio Stadium (very well done, by the way) and to built the Schottenstein basketball/hockey arena (a minor failure). Much of that debt is still outstanding, and it is paid out of football and basketball revenues.Only a handful of universities actually make money off athletics. Ohio State (usually), Texas, maybe a dozen all told. Most lose money on football, including big name programs like Illinois, Purdue. Of course, Ivy League football is a total economic loss.Would I care if Ohio State shutdown its athletics permanently? No. I don’t need the insults.

                When my son was at Ohio Wesleyan, I attended a few Buckeye hockey games. They have a very good team with a very good coach, and every game I attended there was almost no one in the stands. The top section of the Schottenstein center Is closed off. Last game I attended was against UMass, an early season matchup between the top 10 teams. Crickets.

            What are the odds that a black is both over 2 SDs above average in intelligence  and a few SDs over average in athleticism at the NCAA level? Don’t believe the hype.  There are lots of ways they pass blacks through the university with fake grades. Either one, sure, both, gets my spidey senses tingling.

                When I was in the University, you did not need to graduate these guys, only keep them “eligible” to play.  Way back when, the student paper took the time to follow up on the basketball and football players (even then mostly minority recruits) for 5 year graduation rates.The results were startling: 90% of the basketball team and something like 80% of the football team played their eligibility time, but did not graduate in 5 years.  Of course, the head coaches were upset and said the analysis by the newspaper was faulty and gave all sorts of excuses, but the truth was on the table for all to see.

            “Negrolatry”Is that what you call shining the shoes and washing the feet of thugs and pompous religious charlatans?
ILIKEit! Gonna steal that word. However, we must remember that while all joggers are negros, not all negros are joggers. The vast majority these days possibly, but notALL.

        Remember Steven Baca, the guy who was forced to defend himself when attacked by BLM/Antifa in Albuquerque?
The Antifa thug who attacked him with a knife is getting immunity from prosecution to testify against Baca.https://twitter.com/michellemalkin/status/1301329190311002112
We must never, ever get complacent and assume that Rittenhouse is safe just because he has popular support. He could be railroaded like everyone else before him.
Meanwhile, yet another day has come and gone and murderers and attempted murderers like Reinoehl and Grosskreutz continue to run free. BLM/Antifa enjoys protection from the very highest levels of government.

            Isn’t it remarkable how all the terrorist cells were disrupted by feds infiltrating them but Antifa can emerge at a riot and disperse afterwards without a trace.By the way, when was the last time there was a terrorist attack by muslim extremists?

            The only silver lining to all this is that it’s undermining white American support for “color revolution” imperialism abroad. Whenever some GOP harpy starts screeching about “oppression” in China!China!China! or some other country, I think “Who cares? The same shit’s happening here.”
If anything, the Chinese are at least censoring anyone who tries tounderminethe Historic Chinese Nation, while the American apparatus seeks to destroy anyone whosupportsthe Historic American Nation.

OT: Hey, have you guys heard about this Kyle Rittenhouse fellow? Apparently he’s a racist vigilante in this “bugaloo” movement (who want a second civil war to reinstitute slavery and kill millions).

Anyway Kyle drove to a peaceful protest and used an illegal AR (assault rifle) to randomly murdering all these local activists who don’t support police brutality. Fortunately he’s been arrested after an extensive manhunt (he fled the state!) and will soon be tried for his horrific deeds.

        Universities are in a world of shit financially right now.  And these programs prop up all the other athletic offerings, save basketball. Many years ago my alma mater refused to leave their conference for exactly that reason–the share of TV and licensing revenue was too lucrative.  But the silver lining is that whole fiasco looks like it is triggering the rectification that needs to happen in higher education.  Schools are seeing the “full pay” freshmen deferring a year, others are sitting out a semester.  One professor I know at a well know eastern private school told me university had to resort to threatening kids with the loss ofpartial academic scholarships to extort them into “returning” to online classes.  Pulled one of my  kids out for the semester after a couple completely unfulfilling chats with an assistant dean where she could not even begin to articulate the value of 30k tuition for my kid to sit in a bedroom and stare at a computer.  Going through all parents webinars for two schools simply highlighted how incompetent the management  of these schools has become in a world where that has been no competition or market discipline.  While it won’t benefit my pocketbook, I’m optimistic that this will put a dent in the “{fill-in-the-blank} Studies to Antifa pipeline.

            Pulled one of my kids out for the semesterA wise move.When I was at university, and I did a technical degree, the number of people who just went along for ‘degree’ and ‘passport to office job’ was staggering. I would estimate that 85% of any class were not really interested at all in learning for learning’s sake – this struck me as sad but is an obvious result of shoehorning people into university because ‘progress’.In the UK, our former Prime Minister Anthony Blair was very fond of this shoehorning. It is a great shame for young men, in particular, who never even considered (and worse, were rarely encouraged by adults to look at) the trades. I think part of this lies with parents also, I know my parents – and those of my friends – all thought going to university was a must. My mother would often say ‘I just think any degree is worth it’ and in a way, she was right, there was a period where cushy opportunities would open because ‘degree’. But alas, sitting behind a screen all day, degree or not, filling in spreadsheets, can easily be seen (as it often is) as make-work; and after that observation one must do what one can to fend off demoralizing thoughts.

                I’m retired now, but I speak from LONG experience as a professor, at all university levels: The vast majority of students have no idea why they’re there, don’t want to be there, couldn’t care less about anything other than drinking and partying. I used to outright ask any freshman class I taught: “What job are you studying for?” Only the gunners — your obnoxious pre-med types — knew, and you can spot that kind of kid instantly. The rest looked at me with either incomprehension or outright hostility. College is, for 95% of the student population, a 5 year sleepaway camp, at $20K per year.

                    Severian , I can wholeheartedly agree with your commentary on pre-med students as “gunners”. I was one of them, and there is not doubt they ( and I) were focused like a laser on goal of our lives. Any class that was required, but not involved in sciences, was “conquered” with good grade in order to enhance each one’s curriculum vitae for entrance into med School. Would you have had it any other way. I would suspect you were in a similar stance on your way to status as a professor. As an aside but to address the topic of Zman, I worked as a laboratory assistant in the biology dept. in a small state college. I happen to teach a lab class to what was essentially the entire basketball team with a sprinkling of football grunts. I gave a lab test, and charted the seating arrangement of the class so I could tell who was seated next to whom. I implicated all of them (some 24 students) in cheating! When I presented this to the professor of this particular class, he had almost a coronary, and stated that I would get both of us fired, if we exposed this! The time period, I might add was 1957. I suspect times have gotten much worse since across the entire landscape of colleges today!

                    You truly were a college professor.  Your malfeasance is clear in your post.  You didn’t like any of your students, either the partiers or the ones there to work, driven to succeed in a highly competitive field.  You and your kind in academia, hiding from real jobs in the real world, allowed and even kindled the progressive infiltration and indoctrination of our students.  When the revolution happens, academics should be the first under la madame guillotone.

                        Come now, there are many academics posting here.One should not “like” a student who is not inclined to work to master the curriculum, but rather is putting in minimal time and effort in order to obtain a degree.  Seeking credentialism, instead of knowledge so to speak.That is an insult to the profession and the particular academic area the professor has spend a lifetime mastering.  Nothing could be worse than promoting academic mediocrity.  Those students take up seat time and tax payer dollars. The situation is bad, and getting worse, as I’ve spoken about before.I remember once in my old department, we had a speaker from the Dean of Students Office give us a presentation on the state of academic dishonesty in the College and update us on current procedure and University policy.  I was completely taken back when he said that we, in our small department, had the most complaints filed on students for academic dishonesty.Indeed, our department alone, filed most of the complaints from the entire college.  He congratulated us on holding the line on this rapidly growing problem as it meant we were maintaining standards at a time where standards were being watered down and abandoned throughout the University system nationwide.The Assistant Dean had even worse news; The entire College of Engineering (huge) had not filed even one complaint of academic dishonesty over the last year—and they graduate engineers who design and build things, like bridges, skyscrapers, airplanes and what not.  You don’t want mediocrity in those fields.If you’ve read some of my comments in the past, you’ll have some idea of why this reduction in standards is an inevitable process.  I won’t bore you with a repeat of what most of you already understand.

                    Maybe for the white people.
The Asians and Indians actually come to study (well, ok, cheat) to get their degree.
Most white people just view it as a fun experience to drink and have sex.
Guess who’s taking over the STEM and middle class jobs? Not whites.

                        It doesn’t matter as much as you think. , Once a non White gets into management, no White will ever get hired again. Unless you are there to learn specific skills you can’t learn elsewhere even STEM is increasingly a waste of time and moneyAnd any bleats of “don’t these fools know they will destroy everything” are pointless. The other side lacks the forsight for the most part and of the ones that do, they don’t care. This is about power and status and for them a peaceful pleasant nation where they aren’t on top is unthinkable.Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven might as well be the motto.

                        The Asians are an ethnic Mafia, that’s why they’re taking (for a time) STEM jobs. Plenty of hard working white kids are working for those degrees.
We need to handle the Asians as an invasive species- we will, or die.

                            I see no reason for us as a society to educate large numbers of East Asians and sub-continentals. The occasional exchange, no problem. Again, my immigration policy is hockey players and their hot WAGS.

                            This is maybe #2 in difficult topics to discuss with normal conservatives, (#1 anything to do with Jewish influence).
Normal civnat conservatives view Asians as the heroic perfect minority. Smart, hard-working, peaceful. Send more!
Me, I’m more scared of Asian immigration than I am of Hispanic immigration. An overclass is much more dangerous to your heritage population than an underclass.

                    I taught at a minor college level in the UK and the so-called students had no concept not only of studying but also what work beyond involved. They thought on leaving — having successfully copied and pasted stuff they didn’t understand or care about — they would receive huge salaries in undemanding jobs that gave them lots of time off.As fate would have it years later I met a former student, who admitted college was largely a waste of time but was now learning how to do something useful. He was working to become a plumber because he was smart enough to realise life after college was pointless unless he set about learning a trade that people actually wanted. Fixing toilets would have horrified him when he was a ‘student’ but now he could see people would pay him for what he could do.In short, learn a trade and be useful!

                What happened in the US years ago is aptitude testing was barred from hiring screening–despite institutions like the Army using it going over a hundred years.  So a four year college degree became the proxy for consideration.  And so it goes.  Have traded all my career with one of the great British institutions that begins with “L”.  And still run across the occasional oldster that began there as an apprentice out of your equivalent of high school.  Frankly most of them know the business top to bottom.  And were very effective senior execs since they knew their businesses down to the mailroom level.

                    Frankly most of them know the business top to bottom. And were very effective senior execs since they knew their businesses down to the mailroom level.This is something that is totally lost nowadays. A friend of my mother’s, recounting his career for a UK Telco lamented on the huge turnover of his staff. He himself had been there for 25 years, but said it was not uncommon to see people out of the door in under a year.It seems that this sort of system inspires a loyalty and a knowledge – as you mention – that any company would want to aspire to if it could. Many men that I have known started out as an apprentice and where treated very well by the company; in return they forge it’s culture. This has been whittled away.Funny you mention this, as I was talking to a colleague the other day about one of our project managers who has an obsession with contractors. We were both making the case for keeping as much work in house as possible, and our case was strong – but it will not win out. The PM seems convinced that ‘the more the merrier’ and for complex systems that cannot be easily subdivided into tasks, that is not necessarily so.Said PM does have an MBA, though…

                            Socialism of some kind is an inevitable consequence of tech innovation.Otherwise too many people generate to little market value to eat much less have healthy families.If you think otherwise , every industrial nation on planet Earth has below replacement fertility and has for near two generations. This goes into a low a development index as Brazil now/Ultimately this will result in a catabolic collapse of the  entire capitalist system with an intermediary entry either into some of Socialism, Democratic, Nationalist Workers, International, Distributionist , Basic Income  or Technocratic.None of these actually work, humanity has a social carrying capacity as much as a physical one and in time, a few centuries, we won’t be doing Star Trek but 1900 revisited if not a lower tech index.

                                    Whatever faith may teach that its an eternal truth but reality is that all religions come to an end.When societies are unprepared for decline or worse encourage it for material and power base gains  and worse count on religion as social capital to solve problem, it can move to crisis, quickly.Another truth is there does come a point in which there is too much being fruitful.I have no desire for high population density and nor does our society need more cities . Having more than 2 kids that survive to adulthood or so contributes to city growth and social  decay.An extreme example, if all Americans 18-34 were as fruitful as the Amish, we’d add 70 million people in 20 years, 140 in 40 , 280 in 60 and more than half a billion in 80.Just Whites would be 35m in 20, 70m  in 40. This would be fine if we removed basically all non Whites somehow –This owuld put us at 270 in roughly the time from 1980 till now.Problem is in another twenty we’d be at 410 and another twenty after that (from roughly 1960 till now) 680 million.This is more people that’s we can support, have jobs for or have resources for in the long term,Throw in another 20 years, from 1940 till now and you have the population density of China and a society governed by the kid of warren logic of all densely populated societies,The decline in population was in fact a boon exceotthat our short sighted “Big” everything has the morality  of a cancer cell grow, grow, grow and so we got more and more immigration.,

                                        If you have a large project, you’re going to hire people to do it, and when the job is done you’ll lay them off.I have the feeling, and that’s all it is, haven’t tried to build an argument around it, that the population boom was engineered to accomplish some great and imo evil goal that may or may not be nearing completion. I say may not because, while tptb might think they’re wrapping things up, I’m not sure they’re sane and competent.At any rate, if that’s what’s been going on and things are proceeding according to plan, an engineered population collapse would probably be in the cards.If my feeling is correct, and if tptb weren’t ambitious and evil, they wouldn’t essentially breed humans.  I can’t blame them if they feel like a separate and superior race, because we’ve allowed them to treat us like livestock. For all the fecundity of the faithful, they never created a mess like the modern world has.

                                            Nah. I think its pent up demand for families + a great economy  +antibiotics + sanitation+ a modest fertility increase (around 3 for the Boom) becoming  massive population growth.It declined gradually as the economic boom sputtered out and the social changes went in reaching in the USD at least its current level of 1.8 or lower.An argument could be made that 1.8 or lower is the normal rate in industrial society since it hit near this rate in the 30’s during the depression till the late 40’s and than again from 1972 onward  Its possible that the boom was a bubble which is a bit disturbing.The only growth we have now is from momentum and from immigration.The former was a product of the baby boom and the later was a product of the growth at any cost people, i.e the consumer state, big religion, cheap labor and Democrats harvesting votes.The best outcome for all of us is to deport 50 million or so people and just let the population of the West decline till it steadies out.It may require some economic controls to keep the TFR at 2 or so but its doable

One of my PM’s favourite questions to ask us is:
How hard can it be?
This is in relation to what we all know to be a hard technical problem.

                    FYI, aptitude tests such as the SAT are rapidly being phased out of the university admissions process. And in the university where I work, the history department has dropped comprehensive exams as part of the requirement to earn a Ph.D. It’s getting to the point that everybody gets in and is handed whatever degree they want.

                        My alma mater used to have very strict pre-req requirements for history degrees.  Until you completed survey classes could not delve into more specific 300/400 level courses.  Now with no background, in say, American history, you can dive straight into “Queer/Slave Perspectives on Colonial America”, ad infinitum and get a “degree”.  Recall being told by the guy running the China program that unless was willing to take the full year (3 quarters) intro course along with intensive Mandarin, would not even be considered for any of the higher level courses, despite having credentialed in South/SE Asian and Japanese history.  But I understood his point, he wasn’t looking for unserious people.

                    One of my weaknesses is reading WEB Griffin novels. In the “The Corps” series one of the characters comes from a rich family who own a bunch of luxury hotels. This character started in the family business in the laundry, and worked his way through all the different jobs in the hotel. Fiction, I know, but I wonder how many do that today?

            Saml- I’m very close to a senior administrator at a reasonably well branded NE liberal arts college. EVERYONE at her school is all in on Coronapanic. They really believe that this is the black death. They also believe that the value of the brand is so high that students and more importantly the parents, who pay for it all, will put up with anything to save their kids from corona-chan AND get that prestigious piece of paper. As you point out, there is considerable push back from students and parents. Many of these schools are cutting their own throats.As for college sportsball- well, I’m an American- I am accustomed to, and enjoy, in the fall, particularly in my town, the sounds of college football, the band, the crowd, etc. I can hear the games from my backyard on football Saturdays. I’ve always been aware of the inherent corruption of the system, but have chosen to ignore it.I follow hockey and lacrosse at the college level- very white sports with way less wokeness, though our local DIII powerhouse lacrosse (national runners-up the last lacrosse season) team’s coach was fired over, in my opinion, a ginned up racial incident. His replacement is black, in fact the last three coaches hired at this school, hoops, squash, and Mlax are all black. I wonder if the next hockey coach will be black as well

                Not a statistically valid sampling–but I do know that nearly 30% of the incoming freshman class at this school elected to defer a year.  And from informal survey of peers my kid tells me she thinks most of the upper class semester opt-outs are kids paying and/or borrowing to cover tuition.  So from a revenue model, a disproportionate impact.  Hence the more panicked tone of the subsequent calls.  Believe more people than they think will call the bluff.

                    I’ve seen similar numbers, and here’s a bonus fun fact: There are ongoing faculty mutinies all over the place. Like Ganderson says, they’re all Branch Covidians in academia; they’re convinced they’re gonna die if they even set foot on campus, and the big ol’ meanies in the administration are actually forcing them to do their jobs. “Big State: Come for the classes taught exclusively by grad students, stay for the death sentence” isn’t exactly a winning recruiting slogan.

                        Yep.  There are exceptions.  Another kid is finishing up at an all engineering school.  Much smaller faculty–but all voted to come back.  The campus is on pretty tight lockdown, but functioning.  But not a discipline, particularly for the senior thesis projects that can be taught remotely.

I preached that for years — unless you’re in a discipline that requires Calc II, research-grade lab equipment, or both, you shouldn’t be here (yes with very few exceptions for the “Liberal Arts” made on a case-by-case basis). It didn’t do any good, obviously, but maybe now that the Higher Ed Biz has decided to slit its own throat over COVID, some people might remember…

                                When I was an undergraduate in the dorm, we had a guy living there who had a doctorate degree, obtained by mail from an unaccredited degree mill.  I think it cost him a $100 bucks or so.  It was better looking that the stuff our University gave out and was a hoot to see on his wall in his room.  We all had a good laugh when we were drinking there.
Who’d have thought, our University would, in a couple of generations, be  awarding similar worthless degrees at 1000’s the cost.  😉

                                Though one of my kids tells me they are trying to “woke” those too–with limited success.  But generally it means passing the “diversity” element along with barely passing grades.  But because those courses build on each other, it’s hard to keep them in the advanced courses–since by that point they are totally befuddled.

                I don’t understand how people can fall for this. The information is very easily available that COVID is of very, very low risk to college-aged people. I can understand a 65-year-old professor emeritus being a bit worried about it, but the policies should revolve around the thousands of students, not a handful of elderly professors. Let the professor lecture via video screen to a class full of live students. Most of the hands-on work I did on college was handled by young TAs anyway, until I got deep into my major. My consultations with my faculty advisor, etc., could easily be handled over Zoom these days, but the campus and its facilities should be open because the students are at such low risk, and the immunity they may acquire is beneficial to everyone.

                    I don’t get it either. All these supposedly smart people who can’t read data.The other thing about this “pandemic” is the eye test. What does your observation of the world tell you? Are people dropping dead in the streets? Are the morgues overflowing? Are health care workers doing 12 hour shifts, no time off? No, no, and no.CNN yesterday had a headline predicting 400k additional corona-chan deaths by the end of the year. Even if this outbreak is as serious as “they” say it is, how could that possibly be true?

        Sports betting is keeping NFL alive to a large degree. I know a lot of guys who are into that scene and they can’t seem to pull away from it. With all the fantasy football betting money floating around it’s a matter of time till we have a 1919 White Sox type revelation. We all know the joggers are not susceptible to money and hookers right?

            Sports betting only gets you so far.  Without fans in the stands and eyeballs on the TV, it doesn’t keep the sport going.  Boxing has a ton of betting and as a sport it is virtually non-existent.

                Boxing may experience a resurgence as more whites are competitive again.  Anyway boxing has largely been replaced…I’d argue that MMA is popular now because (requiring a surprising degree of strategy in addition to outlier athleticism) whites are again competitive at the highest level.Unfortunately MMA is also being negrified…  rules reducing the effectiveness of grappling relative to striking were a huge step in that direction.  It takes knowledge to appreciate the flow of a grappling chess match… but anyone can understand a dude getting kicked in the face.  Also negros are better at kicking people in the face than thinking three steps ahead.  BLM riots prove that!

        I managed to maintain my American nice guy sports fan soul all the way up to the riots of the last two months. Now things have gotten so IN OUR FACE belligerent and dark, that I’m willing to give up my lifelong Raiders passion and join the ranks of my fellow angry-as-fuck Dissidents and give up sports caring for good. Not just watching…but caring to know the current division standings, playoff “picture”, draft pics, etc. If I saw a segment of blacks taking the side of reality, I might be kinder. But I see no blacks are taking our side. I used to watch the charismatic black Christian preacher T.D. Jakes. Where are black leaders like him on the violent riots and anti-white talk. Whites are Christian brothers too. If anyone here ever catches me posting anything enthusiastic about sportsball again please point out that I’m a weak hypocrite weasel.

        Sports allowed casual discussion that was non political and non religious.  The professional leagues killed that by politicizing the games. One of the benefits of Winnie the Flu has been that we discovered how unimportant pro sports really are. We will now have to find other things to fill up casual conversations, like our homes and gardens.

        “There is no genuine market for their ideas, so they make sure to either cripple the marketplace of ideas with censorship or simply impose their way on everyone by controlling the institutions, like colleges.”This is what makes debating so pointless. I love Jared Taylor but trying to explain something to the other guy is not going to work, because the other guy already knows what Taylor is saying is true, unless he is really dumb/crazy/a minority (in which case arguing about anything is a waste of time). The TV anchor/PR flak sees no percentage in being honest about something like race and IQ and sees a lot of percentage in playing dumb: “Wes brot ich ess des lied ich sing.” Or in English, “Whose bread I eat, his praises I sing.” This is also what’s so dumb about our system of shaming which results in cancellation. The Chinese apparently have a process called “reintegration,” where, after the subject is finished grovelling and being punished, they are worked back into society. Our elite (or their stinging wasps in media) impoverish the target and ban them, and now they have smart and angry people who are their sworn enemies. Sure these people don’t have power (Sailer’s “megaphone”) but they have time and a grudge. Prisoners can get over on wardens and guards having far fewer resources, simply because they have 24 hours instead of eight or 12. If you work where I live, I’m eventually going to beat you, or at least catch you with your guard down.

        The vast majority of college programs get very little in the way of tv revenue, unless they happen to play the part of the sacrificial lamb to some powerhouse.  And w/o fans in the stands, what’s the point?  Even for the major programs, who wants to watch a bunch of joggers and their monkeyshines along with empty stands?  It’s ludicrous.  I would think those income generating sports would start withering on the vine as well, xspecially as they add in the magical negro/anti-White bs.

        All college and professional sports are dead to me. No watching, no TV, no discussion, no interest. Why watch low-IQ fools who hate white people display their hatred and stupidity? Conversely, wouldn’t it be interesting to watch all-white sports leagues with participants who comported themselves with honor and class? Like white people have traditionally been expected to act? Just a thought.

From what Stossel wrote she probably represents my understanding of the world a whole lot better than does Mr Trump. Problem is a single snowflake on the casing of a 50 megaton thermonuclear device stands a better chance of surviving detonation than that nice lady has of being elected. In the electorial system as it exists today, a vote for anyone but Trump is in effect a vote for Kamala Harris – excuse me, Biden. However much I couldWISHthings were different they aren’t.

        The NFL TV ratings starting next week are going to be very closely analyzed.  Anything less than a 10% decline will be spun as a success for the league.  The Big Ten decision to cancel their season is truly baffling, in addition the public relations problems it creates, it is going to kill them in recruiting against the SEC, where they were already having trouble keeping up.  The revenue drop off is happening at a time when college sports and the NCAA are already in trouble.  They may not ever recover.

                Yep. With as much money as college ball makes, it’s simply a given that some parasite is looking for a pretense for a shakedown. The loss of foregone revenue is probably the same as the loss from a class action suit, so you may as well avoid the hassle of staffing and playing.

        College football is one of those uniquely American things. In the rest of the world, sports are a solely professional thing.What? No, 99% of sports in Europe are played in amateur clubs, clubs that you pay to be a member of, and the coaches are most often volunteers. Only a tiny minority of players ever go professional, even in football clubs.Of course, what makes it really weird compared to the rest of the world is the players do not get paid in the traditional sense.What makes it weird is that American football players get paid at all, and the fact that they’re paid in academic rebates and tuition makes it even weirder. Qualifying for college does not necessarily mean you’re good with a swine bladder.

Nor does “being good with a swine bladder” mean you have any business attending an institute of –alleged– higher learning. Which probably explains earlier comments about the criminality associated with college sports.

                Yes. That was what I actually meant to write.
Mind you, college teams seems like a charming idea to me, but not if those teams are run professionally and as a substitute for actual coursework. If you’re good enough to be a pro, you’re probably not applying yourself to your studies.

                    The initiation of college sports goes back to the amateur days of the late 1800’s—where you were truly a student first and then an amateur athlete second.  As with most things, American fans and financial incentives screwed it all up over the years.  Now in most college sports, there are no true student athletes—just wannabe pro’s in the making.
I stopped enjoying such “amateur” college athletics early on in my academic career—especially after having them in class and reading the newspaper accounts of their “exploits”—rape, assault, murder, etc.  While members of the campus “community”.

        For a good while (three decades) I’ve been far more interested in one single issue than any other:immigration. In the meantime I’ve become a hardcore White Nationalist, and was one long before recent events.Now in addition, regarding white men (making some allowance for younger, athletic guys) I take note of whether they have the self-respect to abandon any remaining interest in spectator ‘sportsball’,which is as anti-white as fuck— it’s approaching a litmus test for me.

        College sports watching is extremely regional.  I have to believe that even if there is a spike the first couple of weeks, viewing will quickly drop.  Northern Big State U fans don’t care much for watching Southern MegaState College play Southern Tech University.  The Big Ten and Pac-12 may actually be saved somewhat by not going through the BLM gesturing that the other power conferences are going to be doing.  Meanwhile, the NFL is about to implode.

            But here’s the thing I don’t understand about the way college sports ball has evolved (devolved). Many of the players who are recruited don’t live anywhere near the states where they end up playing. They have no appreciation for the area, no nostalgia for the university or feelings of empathy for its traditions and history. These are feral athletes who are recruited to maintain high coaching salaries and the egos of fans. It is fake loyalty and garish entertainment. The whole thing is madness.

                My observation of the process in the 90s – it’s a mix.  Some of the 5-star recruits just want the right place to train and get playing time for a few years before the NFL.  For others – at USC for instance – grew up nearby and were life-long fans.  Some came in from other parts of the country, met Marcus Allen or OJ (before ’94), saw the campus, the weather, the cheerleaders, the band, the trophies… and said hell yes I want to be part of this.

                Different coaches have different styles of play they prefer and recruit players who are best suited to their system.  In football the latest trends have been towards lots of passing downfield, so a coach will recruit fast receivers, a quarterback with a big arm and a quick running back who can also catch well.  A running back who is strong and prefers to go up the middle isn’t going to play for that coach even if he is highly talented.

                    College football is highly tribal. Or was. Money has turned it into something else. If you want to see Iowa boys play Arizona boys, good luck. What’s the point of “loyalty”? All the fans are really left with is cheering on their favored mascot and colors. When I was young, most university teams were composed of over 95% in-state students. That’s all over now. Check the Alabama roster some time. The concept of state rivalries has become ridiculous.

                Same with the Olympics. For more than a quarter century now we’ve had ‘American’ athletes from wherever because they got the $ and sponsorship, or ‘French’ soccer players who are all African. The whole thing reeks because it’s supposed to be the best athletes from each ‘nation’ when actual nationalism is verboten and the ‘best,’ when judged by people, increasingly tend to be POCs and ‘victims.’  It’s another part of feminized, homogenized clown world and it all needs to die.

                    I wonder how many heritage Americans cheer for the overseas white person in an event instead of the “American”.  I expect in their heart of hearts… LOTS.
What self respecting white person would wants to see big booty american negresses win over beautiful russian gymnasts?
Of course how many whites are self respecting anymore?  I guess we’ll see in November.  That or else we’ll see how many negros work at the post office.

            Technically, correct.  But solstice is somewhat more apt as religious rituals tend to center around those more than the equinox.  And college football is nothing if not a religious ritual.

        I absolutely love CF, but I am a traditionalist. The realignment of teams in conferences that are not regional, the presence of super conferences, the college football playoffs, all started to turn me off, as it was becoming NFL-lite. Throw in a loss of interest due to Covid and then the BLM BS, and I have almost no desire to watch, and likely won’t since my team, the Michigan Wolverines, are not playing.

            NAM attendance levels won’t drop at all without a total overhaul of the administration. The colleges are committed to keeping NAM attendance at their current levels or higher. Lack of sports would simply mean the unqualified black men these school admit would have a lot more free time. It is questionable how much of a benefit they get out of college, but the rest of the college sees some benefit from having them spending 50 hours a week playing a sport. If they are going to be there anyway it is better to have them playing sports.

        That is how it always is with the Left. There is no genuine market for their ideas, so they make sure to either cripple the marketplace of ideas with censorship or simply impose their way on everyone by controlling the institutions, like colleges.

So like abrahamic religion

        My sister is big buddies with Saban’s wife. I sent her the video of his jackassery and the only thing I wrote was UGHHHH.
She wrote back *sigh*
Never let it be said we women aren’t the most passive-aggressive people alive. 😀
I doubt I’ll hear from her for a good long time.

        I dont criticize the boomers for any unique character flaws, since idiots are born every minute.  But… historians will wonder how boomers watched their favorite past-times of strategy and planning devolve into roid raging, full contact , criminal, savage, african hunter gatherer brawls.  It always struck me as traitorous watching white men drool over black athletes. Boomers actually played sports in highschool, but my generation had black monsters shipped to our schools to literally fight to the death on the field.  No white kids wanted to break their skulls with the africans on the varsity teams.  It was obvious these kids were dumber than elementary school whites but special passed to improve the sports program.  They were on steroids in middle school too!.  New research shows africans have thicker bones, so we dont even belong in the same leagues.  I believe black spports normalized black retarded behavior and paved the way for the disgusting black music and degenerate culture that wiggers and sllutty white women are trying to emulate.  Do you think europeans would have invented twerking on their own?  When the boomers are gone, im hoping pro sports goes too.  Younger generations would rather watch eachother play video games on tv.

        So, how does the “Me, Too” movement fit into all of this? One of the biggest conventions of international prostitutes is the NBA All-Star game, where gorgeous black ladies of the evening congregate around an auditorium filled with wealthy African-American athletes who also posses hyper-active libidos. Someone must save those poor ladies from such a dismal fate.

                                    You just saw a picture of him? That’s the extent of your familiarity with Saban?  My parents went to Bama.  I’ve been following them since Bear Bryant days.  Saban is no Jew.   He’s typical hard &amp; charmless East Euro.  A hard Jew will be hard, but with some hidden gruffly warmth.  Sobran sounds similar to Saban.  Both East Euros.  You calling Sobran a Jew?  Fight me right now.

                                            “…I blame them for bringing in these pickaninnies to begin with.”Most slaves came in through Northern ports. Boston took over the slave trade/financing/insurance from Charleston in the 18th century and held that honor till New York became the slave import capital after 1783 and the center for insuring and financing slaves. And New York held that honor right up till Jefferson helped pass legislation to ban the importation of slaves. But there still continued to be a lively black market for the sale of slaves smuggled into New York right up until 1861. So if your ancestors came from the Northeast, hate yourself.
