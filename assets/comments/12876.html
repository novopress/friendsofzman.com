        The best use of the Alt Light/ Prog rear-guard guys is as a spotlight.Milo, Cerno, Shapiro, Sargon, etc. run websites that expose the progs and keep up a steady stream outrage for the normies. We’ve seen that as the progs expand their target list gamers, metalheads, comics readers, the Alt Right has grown. Why? Because they can point out symptoms but only we have solutions.The best thing to do is keep a presence in their comment sections. That way we can poach a few frustrated guys who are ready for actual diagnoses and solutions. This isn’t a large number but think of how much the Alt Right grew because of Gamergate or seeing what college professors think? They aren’t allies, they are useful.

            I used to get a kick out of Sargon’s stuff, but now that the election long past so much of the mild anti-SJW stuff is becoming repetitive. We’ve seen all the take-down moves so many times by now. Also if you just browse the headlines at Breitbart and PJ Media regularly you’ll already know most of the topics Sargon will cover on This Week in Stupid. Do I really need to hear some guy with a British accent read me an article (with the text on the screen) then chuckle about how stupid it all is? One nice thing about Styx is he assumes you know what the news is (or you can and will read it yourself to get up to speed) and gets right down to commentary and speculation. What I like about ZMan’s podcast is he finds off-the-beaten path stuff like today’s thing about the alt-Right and Orthodox Jews.

        My first thought on last weeks apologia on the lack of editing was, he’s going to be pissed when he realizes that there’s no difference between the first few and the ones when he’s spent a couple of hours tuning them up.I download the MP3 burn them to a CD and listen in the car.All sound find to me, but then I’m going deaf in the left ear, oddly that’s the one turned to the wife…

        The sad truth regarding “Porn Studies” is that it’s the result of a “Teufelskreise” (Devil’s Circle) in academia. Astronomical tuition makes a lot of these girls pursuing nonsense degrees do things like webcam shows (and sometimes prostitute themselves), and so the things they do to get money for these stupid courses affect their “area of study” as well. It gets worse: because the girls debase themselves in porn and prostitution, they start to feel resentment toward themselves, which then gets channeled into resentment toward men (feminism). I feel some sympathy for these hapless, crazy girls (I actually took one of these courses in grad school, and know some of these females) and it’s easier to understand why they hate men when you realize they’re sucking sixty year-old cock or beating flabby Jews with leather riding crops to pay off debt for a degree that, at best, will let them scrape by as adjunct faculty. Feminism is basically their heroin to stop the pain of self-loathing these girls feel. Heroin is also many times their heroin.

            I used to be really good at finding out people’s back stories. Maybe I’m still good, but just don’t care anymore. Strippers always seemed to be working off educational debt, real estate debt, or party debt. I actually came to respect them in a way. They could have just gone down the bankruptcy route after all.

                Every stripper I met in New England said she was a student at Johnson and Wales. No kidding. It became a running joke as I’d always ask.
As far as backstories, people love telling me their life story. I must have a friendly face.

                    BTW, Deleuze’s “philosophy” (if I can call it that) contains three “lifelines,” one of which is molar.  I didn’t want to read ten-thousand words of French nonsense, but the best I could come up from bouncing around the webz is that it refers to the concept of a “mole” in chemistry. The progression is from molar to segmented to molecular.  I’m guessing that in plain English, that might mean _really_ fragmented (6.023 x 10^23 is a lot of fragments) to somewhat fragmented to more or less whole.  I shouldn’t waste time on this sort of stuff, but I love a real-life puzzle.

                        Yeah, I started down that rabbit hole and realized I had no need to know anything about Deleuze. The molar bit just made me laugh every time I thought of it.

        Yeah, last week’s podcast was one of the best. You are increasingly terse, perhaps dismissive of a select number of things as if to say–if you’re here catch up already, there are important things that await attention. Conservative inc., civic nationalism, a dead Constitution, whatever has established a long record of losing. Some people will take it personally. I didn’t. This is fun. Lead on.

        These Edgitarians are shaping up to be Girondists.  All talk, all debate, no action.  Psychologists all, willing to discuss issues out of existence with a strong probability of failure.  Their flesh will be consumed with all the spectacle and fanfare as the Girondists, I hope.I desire to be entertained at least.

            The issue is they concede the premise to the Left and then start negotiating on behalf of the rest of us. “We all agree that racism is bad, but why is it bad to want to send your kids to good schools? Oh, its racist? OK. How about we bus in some blacks? Oh, not enough? How about….”

        Re: Peterson Milo etcAbsence of evidence is not evidence of absence.If somebody joins the real right, and is asked “how did you get here” is he more likely to say: “A friend tipped me of to the … site, and that convinced me” or “At first I listen to Peterson, then after a another year I … and then I got to talk with … and then last year I found the … site” etc.I.e. I still believe that people like Peterson can have a good impact on turing people away from the left. Once somebody is turned onto the path of truth seeking …Of course they can get stuck in some intermediate step. But even then it leaves the (far) left weakened.

        Z – whats your view on feminism? My view has always been that yes women can work but that not all of them want to and if they can afford to stay at home and want to, that there’s nothing wrong with that. You’ll always have outliers such as a woman who is an engineer or microbiologist but outside of those talents – college probably isn’t a good idea and it would be better to spend those years working, living on your own and eventually meeting a guy.I’m pretty sure Jordan Peterson would agree with this as would most of the altright.
