        “Way back when we were hunter-gatherers, bands of humans would attack other groups and try to kill every single one.”
Not quite true.  Fertile females were allowed to live if they agreed to become wives or concubines of those who killed their men.

            Not really. Females moved between groups, but most likely it had little to do with war. Studies of mtDNA shows much wider distribution than Y-chromosome distribution. Observations of the few hunter-gatherer groups remaining shows females movement between groups. Either way, females had no say in the matter so there were certainly some women carried off after the men were all killed or chased off.The point here is that one of the earliest human behaviors to evolve was war. Early humans lived astoundingly violent lives. Killing off the competing males was a primary goal of ware because it had reproductive advantage. Groups of related men had good reason to work together to defend their turf and kill off the other men. That trait is still with us today.
