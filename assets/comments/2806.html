        “He tried to do it over the summer, but the idiot in the White House screwed it up with the Children’s Crusade at the border.”It wasn’t just the idiot in the White House.  Conservative Inc. had its fingerprints all over the Children’s Crusade.  The GOP was trying to use the Crusade to shoehorn the Dream Act past the base.  Shows how tone deaf they are; that debacle is what cost Eric Cantor his job here in VA.Notice how Boehner keeps chanting “secure the border” like a mantra.  So does Ryan and the conservative commentariat.  This is the tell.  After the midterms, The Ruling Class will announce some kind of agreement on border security.  Obama, who is a lame duck and can take the heat without consequence will announce some showy deportations and other enforcement “crackdowns”.  La Raza and Luis Gutierrez will gnash their teeth on cue and declare Obama the traitorous “Deporter in Chief”.  Someone trusted by the conservative base, most likely Ted Cruz, will announce himself satisfied with these “tough” new border security measures.  Boehner, Ryan, Pelosi, McCain, Graham, Rubio, and Reid will then put forward some kind of amnesty measure that will pass both Houses of Congress and will be signed into law by President Obama.If the scenario does not play out along these lines, I will be shocked.  Of course, if there are any snags, Obama will just announce an executive amnesty, safely after the mid terms.  He will do this not caring for the electoral consequences in 2016, because the Dems want to lose anyway.
