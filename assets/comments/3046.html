        Crap like this continues because too many people just shake their heads in disbelief, but then do nothing. It’s long past time for pushback.

        Why do you mention Rosseau? Cultural Marxism is a invention of the Frankfurt School, the jewish teachers from the Frankfurt School defined what post-WWII Germany should be for America. Later they defined what the West should be.

            Why do you mention Rosseau?All of these Utopian faiths spring from Rousseau. The most damaging words ever uttered by man:The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying This is mine, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society.  From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not anyone have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, “Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.”
