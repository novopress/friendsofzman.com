        I think the virile normalcy of Trump’s sexual appetites is another reason the Cloud People hate him. There is incidental anti-Cloud counter signaling in banging gorgeous, feminine women half your age.
That said, hedonistic quirks aren’t necessarily indications of a lack of seriousness. To stick with emperors, Tiberius (“Tiberius’ minnows”) and Hadrian (his obsession with the Elysian mysteries and his drowned boytoy) are generally regarded as decent-to-good leaders.

            My theory is that the prevailing culture is simply anti-sex.  Male heterosexual  confidence and desire is the fuel that keeps the sexual economy (pardon the mixed metaphor) going.  The left has done everything it can to extinguish this:sexual harrassmentdeliberate disenfranchisement of men from the “modern economy”divorce and all the trimmings along with it (ie. family law)full throated celebration of homosexuality (particularly male homosexuality)demonisation of “bro culture” (ie. healthy male homosociality)general destruction of heterosexual male statusditto for female reproductive purposerevulsion of healthy familiesand I could go on and onit is, as usual, puritannical values given a superficial sheen of sexual liberation.Japan is the ultimate goal…all the more need to import third worlders right?

                    Another possibility is Stravinsky’s ‘Rite of Spring’. Or Resphigi’s ‘The Fountains of Rome’. But yeah, Wagner is tip-top here too.

        Well done, Mr. Zman! You have a very nice speaking voice, and the sound quality was excellent. Your subjects are of course well chosen, and you speak with knowledge.I should have taken notes; I still much prefer written copy, so that I can more easily refer back to the things that caught my attention. At least now I know that I should do that next time!It’s sad that our immigration &amp; educational policies for the past decades have resulted in the dumbing-down of our population, and the coarsening of our public discourse certainly shows that happening. We have lost trust in each other as well as faith in our country.Diversity is another word for fragmentation, and it disintegrates our culture.

        Fascinating thought, after listening to the section on “Edison’s Test”. I love classic 40’s-50’s Looney Tunes cartoons, and have found them to be fascinating little time capsules of their era. And I’d bet that 90% of the oxygen suckers in a modern college classroom probably wouldn’t recognize the puns and references in, say, “A Hare Grows in Manhattan”, “Hare We Go” or “Rabbit of Seville”. (They would, of course, hyper-trigger into such a state of raging woke-itude that they’d have a collective aneurysm.)Side note about Paleofuture: yeah, it’s part of BuzzFeed. So, it’s written by sneering wannabe Daily Show writers who couldn’t get a job at Vox. Occasional source of entertainment, but nothing more.

            Disagree. I’d rather take my chances with Irma than with Hillary.
That said, if you are in the danger cone shown on your map, I wish you well.

        Hmpfffff. I had no problem with most of the Edison test. And I am not patronizing anyone; most of you boys here are way smarter than me. Vox Day once called me a pig ignorant mid-wit and I didn’t get mad at all because it’s mostly true.I regard pre-employment tests as mostly quackery.

        I am fascinated to learn Bill Kristol has a podcast and YouTube channel…I’m trying to imagine who’d be the audience for that kind of thing. A bunch of deracinated, Cato Institute loving DC BugMen, but that doesn’t seem like it would be a huge audience. Do many NeoCon Baby Boomers download podcasts???

        Z,Another fun cast.  I like the music and hope you can run it far enough in to get the gals’ entrance.  And think of all the skid marks in DC if the whole thing were to be played loudly over public speakers on Pennsylvania Ave.As regards the brain dead fogies, one of my favorite proposals is to ban hair dye for all members of Congress.  Let the public see what a decrepit bunch of arthritic nitwits we have in charge.Having taught at a number of universities as an adjunct or part timer over the past 40 years, I can attest to the declining quality of U.S. Students even at very selective universities.  And speaking of panic, as soon as I would put a bit of calculus on the board the Americans would panic, the East Asians would see another “A”.

        Things to consider:
1. Demographic change means that traditional conservatism will have no broad support
2. The right wing movements appeal to no one under 40 (seriously, why are you guys so old?) and no women
Taking the above into account, how do you expect anybody to take you sincerely?

                    When they allow Social Security and Medicare to run dry, take away all the free pills and meds, make it impossible for the old people to find a doctor, take away the driver’s licenses of incapable old folks, and make it impossible for people to go outside without being armed and trained in how to use them, it’s going to be an interesting state of affairs.

            That border will be enforced. Even Cankles Clinton is saying we need to deport illegals now. After that is taken care of, the social programs will either be destroyed or administered with common sense. Vibrants will either self-deport or adopt conservative values to survive.And – kids are proggies and liberals until they grow up and have to get jobs to support themselves and their families. Then most go hard right. Those gay social justice warriors that won’t grow up look mighty different through the eyes of an adult. As do those lonely, angry feminists that are so ugly inside and out,  they can’t get laid. Saw a study somewhere that said 50% of our young people favour Trump. Granted, most of them are white, and do well academically… so the left definitely IS losing ground. If they keep imploding st the rate they’re going they’ll be a shadow of themselves in five years and pretty much a ghetto party.Women? There again: most women have either sons, brothers, husbands or fathers getting screwed by proggie political correctness either at work, or in divorce court, in the media, etc. Thanks to the Buckwheat Administration they (and their daughters) now have to pee and poop alongside trannies and perverts that come in 32 gendered varieties. Fact is, if Civil War 2 breaks out, it will probably be women driving it.We don’t expect to be taken seriously by stupid people. That’s why we’re taking the country back, and why we will either drain their swamp and remove them peacefully, or kill them.

            The right wing movements appeal to no one under 40
It annoys me that there have not yet been cross-tabs in any of the scant public polling about the alt right that have included age ranges. I’m confident when one rolls out–and it will–we’ll find that the Alt Right’s strongest base of support will be among those under 40.

                Looking at Trump rallies there are plenty of women and folk under 40. It certainly does not have the geriatric tinge to it like the Tea Party movement when you had people showing up in Rascals.I do see more women getting involved because they are taking it in the teeth from the Left/Cloud People. They are forced to shared their bathrooms with male perverts and the same for their daughters. And they don’t like it one bit.See unlike the childless harpies on the Left – they don’tEventually they’re gonna realize the Cloud people will throw them and the LGBT crowd under bus as they begin to welcome in more Muslims. Rape? ‘oh get used to that’  will be their response. You children being raped? ‘oh that’s not a bug it’s a enriching cultural feature of Islam and how dare you criticize it! Police arrest that woman!’. After all that’s how the British elites view it.
