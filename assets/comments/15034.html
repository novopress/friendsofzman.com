        “This is not who we are” has replaced “You’re on the wrong side of history.” It seems the degenerate Left always has some pat phrase that they think will effectively silence dissents.

If you get down to The Netherlands let me know. I’d be happy to show you the best spots in Amsterdam for a beer.

        Not sure about Copenhagen but Helsinki is definitely getting more “vibrant” by the day.  If you walk through the shopping malls during mid day you will see large groups of so-called immigrants hanging around.
Mostly muslims, but what the blacks lack in numbers they make up for  with their obnoxious behavior. Most locals don’t see this because they’re busy working.
There is a small amount of backlash. The Sons of Odin come to mind.Not sure of their numbers. Just hope for Scandinavia’s sake opposition to this invasion continues to grow.

        A little further south there is Belgium.  Belgians have a reputation for being slow.  As in slow-witted.  I’ve had a few conversations with some, and they had a slow manner.  Anyway, does anyone know if the reputation is warranted?   Are they more Kraut or Surrender Monkey?  Should they be taken over again?  What is the point of Belgium?  Thanks.

            The point of Belgium is to be a buffer state between France and Germany (Prussia). Anglo geopolitical strategy has always been based on the recurring fear of a Continental hegemon. It also divides the major Rhine ports (Antwerp, Rotterdam) between two countries. Imagine if Louisiana was carved up on a linguistic barrier (Cajun French/English), a new port could be built on the Atchafalaya.

                    Much of the Netherlands is built on reclaimed land that was formerly something akin to swamp or estuary. Blasting a channel from Baton Rouge down the Atchafalaya would be an excellent idea in an authoritarian system.

                        No need for blasting anything. It cost millions a year to keep the mississippi from flowing into the atchafalaya naturally. Google old river control structure.

            Belgium has always been Europe’s unhappiest country, the reason being they are two peoples, with nothing in common but mutual animosity. Curiously, the best thing about Belgium and the one Belgians are proud of is school choice, unrestricted school choice.

            Actually Belgium is a delightful country. They have some beautiful cities, excellent food and they make some of the finest small arms anywhere in the world. Sadly, though, parts of Brussels resemble Tangiers.

                    Agree. Ideally the country would split into  Flemish and Walloon regions (Dutch Protestant and French Catholic reapectively historically). The problem is with reference to Molenbeek etc., where does Kebab go?

                        Belgium was historically Catholic, as it was a Habsburg possession. The Netherlands revolted (1568-1648) because it was Protestant. Both territories ended up as the Netherlands after the defeat of Napoleon (1815), this is also how the Dutch got a King, previously they had an aristocratic republic like the UAE of today. The Catholic south revolted (1830) and was given its independence as Belgium thanks to Britain.

                        I believe that, historically, there has been a lot of talk about splitting the country along the Dutch Protestant/French Catholic lines but the split never materialised. It may be that failure to answer the “who is going to get the kebabs” question which may prevent it from ever happening.

        Society will be in for a major structural adjustment when the Grim Reaper of automation comes for service industry jobs. The steel mills of Cleveland today only employ around 4,000 people, when at their peak it was something like 50,000, yet production is higher in terms of tonnage. If similar achievements happen in restaurants, janitors and retail, the economic basis on which the Third World moves to the First World (or the Gulf Arab states) and remits money back, will collapse.

            This transition is already accelerating. Walmart with a revenue of 500 billion worldwide, employs 2.3 million (217K/employee). Amazon with a workforce of 560,000 achieves a revenue of 178 billion (318K/employee). Alibaba of China is even more productive, a revenue of 40 billion off of 67K employed (600K/employee).

            It depends. If a robot costs a million dollars to do the job of a human and has a annual maintenance cost of say $40k. It won’t happen.Automation works in certain industries where the cost of automation is justified in terms of productivity and efficiency improvements.I don’t see it in the service industry like say restaurants or janitorial work for the simple reason is cost and loss of flexibility.  So far I haven’t heard of a robot chef than can do more than one thing and that’s flipping burger patties. BFD.And what happens when the robot dies during the lunch or dinner crowd or worse starts making undercookerd or overcooked food? That spells doom.When the nerds can make a robotic chef than can make a dozen menu items from say the Olive Garden or Claim Jumper and do it for under $100k and  $30k annual maintenance and support. It’s getting close.Janitorial robots? Same thing except it the robot has to cost say $10k and do everything a human worker can.  Not happening in this century.

                The first shifts are already underway, mostly in delivery. Flying drones are probably still far off, but ground drones are in service, unsure if they are profitable. In the states where min. wage is being raised to 15/hr, it could be feasible.Shifting to a delivery model rather than a table model makes more efficient use of expensive bicoastal real-estate. Perhaps drones function as ATMs did, increasing the number of bank branches (restaurants) and employment. That increase in employment is actually now on the downswing as cash declines and mobile payments are increasing. The number of ATMs is in a slow decline.The cost of automation goes down with the increase in chip capacity.

        While living in Atlanta, I visited Denmark in the early 1990s. While Atlanta is a very new city, in Copenhagen, every building looked like it was 50+ years old. My hotel was probably 100 years old; the shower must have been designed by a masochist, as the water temperature oscillated between freezing cold and scalding hot with a duty cycle of about 30 seconds.As a car guy, I got to talking about the price of cars while riding in a local guest’s car that was Toyota’s local equivalent of a Carolla. He paid $40K for the car due to import duties on a car that would have cost $18K back home. I thought to myself, the duties must be in place to protect the massive Danish car industry.

On the contrary. The duties are there to protect the balance of payment. In countries that don’t have their own money press – i.e. everybody except America – you have to earn a dollar before you can spend it, so for every car bought, you need to export produce for a similar amount or your currency crashes.
If Denmark made their own cars, this wouldn’t be a problem.

        The thing I hate about women is they love being do-gooders.  Their whole M.O. is to appear morally angelic.  But they also love complaining about how society has an unfair expectation of them to be good.   So they throw on graphic T’s declaring themselves “BITCH”,  “BAD GIRL” and “SLUT”.  Take THAT society!   They truly are unsatisfiable beings.  (I’d say insatiable, but they don’t deserve the sexy connotation anymore).

                It’s a fantastic turn of phrase. Quote all of the Wikipedia (lol, clear bias demonstrated; global warming, anyone?), Bianca, or again the scientifically questionable social “sciences” that you like. I’ll believe the empirical evidence of my eyes. Others have noted it here as well. Like Z, I live outside Lagos. It is all around me and has extended to the exurbs. At one time, it was only landwhales and obvious head cases; now it’s even infected the divorcees and career women.Advertising targets women, pure and simple. Miscegenation is the Narrative. The overwhelming number of portrayed couples are white woman/black man. The only white couples are homos…

                    True about the advertising, but ya know, that’s not real life.  That’s a dream world.  While it is true white women marry black men at a slightly higher rate (0.8%) than white men marry black women (0.3%), white women still intermarry less than white men overall.https://www.npr.org/2011/10/14/141235709/the-changing-face-of-seeing-raceI know, NPR.

                        Lineman, most people date before they marry and while they may date and cohabit with one another after marriage, they do it as a married couple.  Dating and cohabitation come before marriage, if marriage takes place.  I’m not making any assumptions about white men being more willing to date and marry interracially than white women are, it’s in the stats.  You may not like that fact, but there it is.  Are you thinking white women date interracially less than white men, but somehow end up cohabiting interracially more?  Pleased to meet you, let’s cohabit? Yes, I do know black people personally.

Cohabitation is the order of the day.”It’s difficult to locate statistics on interracial dating and cohabitation, but there was this tidbit:“Of the 2.4 million heterosexual interactions researchers reviewed, the findings show:*Women get three times the interactions men do.*ALL MEN SEEMED TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN PEOPLE OUTSIDE THEIR RACE.*Black men and women get the lowest response rates to their messages.*All women except black women are most drawn to white men, and men of all races (with one notable exception) prefer Asian women.”https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/11/30/247530095/are-you-interested-dating-odds-favor-white-men-asian-womenAgain, I know, it’s NPR.  But one would have to guess that people who date interracially would have roughly the same stats as those who gigabit or marry interracially, since one thing leads to another.  At any rate, men overall date and marry interracially more than women and white men do so more than white women.  It’s just a fact.

        I hope you get to shoot the shit with Jared Taylor at least.
Maybe the Lord does work in mysterious ways. On your way to a white ethnos conference you learn to embrace diversity. Of course being from Lagos you are already well groomed for it.

                    There’s also Pew and The Census. The gap is small, but white men intermarry more than white women.“Among white newlyweds, there is no notable gender gap in intermarriage – 12% of men and 10% of women had married someone of a different race or ethnicity in 2015.”http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/05/18/1-trends-and-patterns-in-intermarriage/Maybe you’re just not paying as much attention to white males marrying Asian and Hispanic women as you are to white women marrying blacks.

            We need to scorn and shame white men who choose Asians.  I live in a red state and it is fairly common to see the white man-Asian woman pairing.  I understand the appeal.  Most men just want a woman who is not fat and not a feminist bitch and unfortunately, more Asian women meet this standard than whites, per capita.  My message is you are damaging your people for your personal satisfaction and that’s wrong.

                It’s very definitely not just a matter of looks.East Asian women come from a culture with an uninterrupted, multi-millennial tradition of intact families, emphasis on personal responsibility, filial piety, frugality, willingness to work hard without complaint, a tradition that meshes very well with Biblical values.Such women will inevitably pass some of these traits on to their children. If they happen to be Christian, so much the better.The Left has been using churches, the school system, the MSM, the courts and the government to poison people’s minds for multiple generations. We need all the help we can get.Rather than succumb to narrow tribalism, isn’t it better to form strategic partnerships? Asian women are our allies against the leftist juggernaut.

        Thats a fair point about the female role. I do think the PUA’s and manosphere types are on to something regarding sexual market place value. It’s been a regular feature on gossip mags in the UK, usually some aging spinster who finds love on an exotic location usually the Caribean, Middle East. When you look at the dating stats the most desired groups tend to be White males, there’s a parity from the female side between White and Asian female. The bottom rung of desirability is taken by black males/females. If you’re 3 or a 4 out of 10 within your Ethnic group, you raise your status by checking out and searching in the less desired pastures. To take two random celebrities Melissa McCarthy is overweight and unattractive, but put her up against Leslie Jones and the flaws don’t stand out as remotely as much. And there’s always thirsty men in all ethnic groups. And the chance of moving to a permissive welfare state and you get a nice bit of cash into the bag.
