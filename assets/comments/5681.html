        I respectfully disagree. Let me clarify…I do agree that free market capitalism is indeed an innovation growth machine. William Baumol makes the case in the book of the same name. What differentiates free enterprise from other economic systems is that innovation self amplifies, and the participants have to innovate or they effectively lose ground relative to their peers by standing in place. Your basic Red Queen phenomenon, but with a twist. Free enterprise requires people to solve problems for other (a form of cooperation) to advance their own interests (when properly functioning).Second, I need to clarify that endless growth is possible. The reason is because what grows is Problem Solving ability. Value and knowledge are not objective material qualities and they can increase without limit, or increase so much further than today as to make any limits to growth discussion absurd.Third, growth — again defined as cumulative problem solving volume in a society  — is in general a good thing. The reason is that people tend to prefer solutions over problems, and if the world is not growing in net solutions then any improvement in position for one needs to come, by definition from a net deterioration to someone else. This is a zero sum, win/lose dynamic, and it leads quickly to arms races of exploitation, attack and defense which actually tends to become a negative sum situation as people redirect their efforts to struggling over capped resources.  I will say that not everybody wants growth in problem solving ability. Fine, they don’t need to pursue it.  Those that do, had better have positive sum outlets (where they can advance their own interests by advancing that of others) or we are screwed.Fourth, the track record for “the strange modern religion” of free enterprise vs all other alternatives is simply unbelievably amazing. The other systems have always capped out at a couple dollars per day in purchasing power problem solving (aka Malthusian subsistence living for most people) with virtually no growth, short lifespans, longer working hours, thirty to fifty percent child mortality, and so on. Modern non market systems can however free ride or draft upon free market innovation and growth (many do).I agree that increased immigration is NOT essential to market growth. International trade accomplishes much of the same thing in the same way.  Indeed, although more humans does seem to correlate with more growth per capita in free markets as per Julian Simon, there are obvious trade offs.

        Wow, talk about a group of people with no knowledge of how things work.“We need to let in more people to grow our economy”.But in order to grow an economy, you (meaning some entity) must harvest and process natural resources like petroleum and metals and such.But, the CML doesn’t WANT to harvest resources.  They are Luddites, for the most part, who worship the god of environmentalism, and thus want the earth protected.How are you going to grow the economy if you don’t harvest resources?Not only that, but if you bring in more people to grow OUR economy, you have fewer people in the other country, and their economy will shrink.  Can you say Zero Sum Game, anyone?

        The prog may as you say rely on many forms of ersatz growth to attain his ends, but there is no growth in Utopia. Growth is a word which is opposite to Utopian ends. The chief prog will of course have all the privileges which are his due in running the monastery…shepherding the citizen in his duties, improving his mind and awareness.
When Adolf couldn’t make things go his way he blew up his ungrateful country. I don’t see why things should happen so differently here. At that time progs will re-settle in Davos.

        Asset valuation is an ephemeral thing. Things are worth only what someone else will pay for them, at any given moment. The notion of never-ending economic growth is the means to feed the asset valuation beast. If assets are not in ever higher demand, then available supply will often overwhelm demand (oil and copper right now?), and asset values shrink. The uber-wealthy are all wrapped around the valuation of the assets that they own, that are surplus to their own real needs. They spend considerable time and money greasing the way for the surplus assets they own to be ever valued more highly.  The limits of growth and the shrinking of demand frighten them to their very core. They will sacrifice all of our long runs, including their own, to satisfy their short run preference. It is just human nature to do so, I suppose.

        They’re scared out of their little minds by deflation. The only way they know how to forestall it is by throwing people and money into the equation.The thing that scares them the most after deflation is population growth. So they’ve convinced their own people to stop having babies and have started importing Vandals and Huns to fill the empty houses and retail aisles until they can propagandize the barbarians to stop having babies.They don’t want to believe the tenets of the CML, they must. Otherwise, they’d have to face the horror of the coming disaster that they themselves have fashioned.The analogy is exact. If religion helps us cope with the horrors of death, then CML buffers its adherents from the collapse of their world. They’ve completely hosed themselves. Indefinite growth is unsustainable. The barbarians are inside the gate. The civilization-crushing specter of long-term deflation flickers on the near horizon. Their faith is the only thing left to sustain them.

        I think the Cult of Economics is like the Cult of Modern Liberalism — a piss-poor ersatz answer to one of the old, profound questions.  As CML answers the old existential question “What’s the meaning of life?”, Economics answers the question “what’s a nation for?”Since the Peace of Westphalia, the answer to that second question has been “to preserve the lives, property, andcultureof the people within its borders.”  The point of Germany was to help German-ness thrive.  France was above all things the guarantor of French-ness.  Italy unified because Italian-ness wasn’t sufficiently protected by the hodgepodge of powers on the peninsula, and Austria-Hungary collapsed because Austrians weren’t Hungarians (and vice versa).But now there’s no such thing as nation-ness.  The ruling clique sees all humans as fungible, to taste based on their ideology — either interchangeable producer-units (for the socialists) or interchangeable consumer-units (for the libertarians).  The Elite’s job is to reconfigure these units to optimize output.  If the economy isn’t always growing, what good are the Elite?
