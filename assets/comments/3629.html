        Well, it seems obvious that anyone with an occupation subject to drug testing, such as patient care, child care, or equipment operation, would find themselves in demand in states which have legalized weed. There will arise in these states a stratified, caste – ridden society of potheads, and those who abstain for the sake of providing for their families. The potheads will call this unfair, and blame anyone but themselves.

        At the turn of the twentieth century a number of counties around the country were dry. Opium was illegal in San Francisco; it had been quite the problem there. That didn’t affect mom in the rest of the country, and the middle aged housewife was the typical addict. Cocaine was $2.50 an ounce at the pharmacy. You could blend the one with the other and call it Tonic.But the war between the Old Republic and Progressivism was hot. Our first Progressive President emerged. 1905, the last year in which the Republic had no drug law. The Federal Reserve was on the way.  Senators by popular vote. Universal suffrage. Prohibition. Woody and Franklin. The New Deal, the Great Society.Then the Progressives changed their minds, but only about mind altering substances out of a bottle or bag. The other mind altering stuff stays. Only an altered mind could watch the SOTU.

        Oh, “legal…”.   I always wondered how a plant could be illegal, kind of like a child being illegitimate.

            “He” is so cysgendered. S/he also put venomous snakes out there too. Yet, we don’t try and get bit by snakes.
Legal intoxicants are fine as long as you have other methods to curb excess and punish abuse. In the welfare state, excess is encouraged and abuse is rewarded.

        It ain’t necessarily so. According to Forbes, 2011, Spiegel, 2013 &amp; many others, Portugal’s decriminalization is an overall net plus with fewer medical problems, OD’s, drug users, etc. A 2014 report by UK Charity, Transform, titled “Drug decriminalisation [their spelling] in Portugal: setting the record strait,” notes:“The Reality is that Portugal’s drug situation has improved significantly…while the dramatic rise in use feared by some has failed to materialize…such improvements are not solely the result of decriminalisation, but also a more health centered approach…”Further, personal experience with smoking doesn’t jive.By HS in the 50’s nearly all kids smoked and you are right – advertising promoted it, probably the most influential being the movies where pretty girls displayed interest by leaning forward for a light and the handsome male stars did so with elegance. Boys learned to strike matches in all kinds of “cool” ways including on their teeth. Zippo lighters could be sprung open with a 1-hand trick &amp; the little lighting wheel spun with a finger click – boys learned all sorts of cig lighting tricks to impress.During the 60s my friends were accepting that it was really bad for you and started quitting which nearly all did over the following decade or two and long before public smoking was banned. At HS reunions of hundreds, people had long ago quit.As I understand it, huge numbers of US soldiers had heroin habits during the Vietnam war and quit on their own when returning.Legalize the drugs and tell people the truth about them, though government doesn’t have  much credibility for such job.

        Then there’s the “other” legal state, Washingon. We finally got the state out of the liquor business. So, to make sure that no bureaucrats were harmed, they put them in charge of the new pot business. Several counties have passed laws preventing pot from being sold in their area, so it really is a patchwork. And, they didn’t get around to licensing growers until late in the game, so demand outstrips supply. No one talks about legal pot in WA, because it’s easy to get the illegal stuff.

            I’ve always been a bit skeptical about the the availability of weed. I hear middle-class people say, “You can get pot anywhere. May as well make it legal.” I often ask, “where do you buy your pot?” The response is always to dodge the question, but the fact is most people don’t smoke pot nor do they know anyone who does smoke pot. Getting started would be a lot tougher than going down to Walmart and buying a bag of weed.Reading up on Colorado’s experiment, the first take away is that the increase in usage is vastly higher than expected. Maybe that’s the novelty, tourism or some other short term cause. Maybe it is simply the result of better supply, better marketing and the lack of cultural taboos to tamp down usage. The other lesson so far is that it has not eliminated the black market. There’s are fewer arrests for possession, obviously, but the black market remains in place. At some point, policing will adjust and arrests will climb back up. Maybe not to previous levels, but we will still have weed dealers in the court system.I’m open minded on legalizing cannabis. I just think we are in for a long period of discovery with lots of unpleasant surprises. Public policy is about trade-offs. We’re about to find out what the other side of the legalization ledger will hold.
