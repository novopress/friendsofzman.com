        When ESPN talking heads begin ranting about the unfairness of college football players not getting paid, I can only wonder whether  any of them have ever heard of Title IX. You can bet that if the schools pay the guys, they will also have to pay the gals. And since women’s softball—just to take one example—makes no money at the gate, plus their squads are big and their travel costs huge, it’s always going to be a big money loser, unlike big time men’s football. But, colleges fear federal penalties under Title IX, so they’ll never drop women’s softball regardless of the sport’s bad economics, even now when the players are NOT getting paid.Pushed too far, the idea of paying college students to play sports could bankrupt a lot of small athletic programs and give such schools pause whether intercollegiate sports are really worth it.  At that point, if programs are downsized or even cancelled, the black athletes who now get into college based on their athletic ability rather than their scholastic ability, will end up being the losers…all because other busy-bodies thought it was somehow unfair these student athletes were not getting paid like a pro.

        Interesting that ESPN always does an Obama piece daily. Curiously, here in the UK the BBC always lead when they can with Obama. When the news broke about Robin Williams’ suicide, they not only lead the flagship news with that story but started with Obama’s comments on the man.
No one in the UK voted for Obama and we have our own problems with disaffected minorities. However, your president gets pole position no mater what happens. It is like someone high up in London cares about the man…

            The greatest fear in America is something happens to Obama. It is not just that having Biden as president is so frightening. It’s that Obama will be on all of our money forever.

        Those dangerous displays of masculine testosterone are what keep many countries civilized.  I say the world has a choice:   pick one, the Olympics or World War III?Cowherd has probably never seen a sprint car in his whole life, so he doesn’t know there’s a huge wing on the top of the car that extends far down one side of the car (right side from the driver’s perspective), almost completely blocking the driver’s view in that direction. That’s where the irate Ward was standing when he was hit by Stewart’s car. Among his other mistakes, Ward couldn’t have chosen a worse place to stand on the track.
