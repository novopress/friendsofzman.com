        “It is an identitarianism that is majority white, but tolerant of a fringe that is not white, but fully assimilated.”
That’s how we may frame America, but JD’s family situation smells of the libertarian oligarchy attitude that people are interchangeable, that this is not a blood and soil country. Our demographics are in a dire situation right now. That is really the only issue that matters. I have trouble believing that someone with a lefty “Asian” wife is going to be sensitive to the need to get the house in order.

            Exactly. Setting aside the assassination attempt, Trump is an old man, and the chances of this guy becoming El Jefe if Trump is elected are pretty significant.Something tells me that if a guy with a son named Vivek becomes the head honcho, the primary change we can expect is that the flood of immigrants becomes his San Fran girlboss wife’s 203 uncles and 3rd cousins named Pajeet instead of guys named Juan.Frankly, I would rather take the one’s named Juan. They at least have some fragments of European culture in their background from the continent’s history. The dot Indians are busy shaking off any memory of Brotish colonialism and in the main are totally alien.

                That’s exactly what happened under Zero, I never saw as many people at the grocery store with head wraps as I did after he was finished with his 8 years of destruction. Remember, born in Hawaii, but his heart was in Indonesia. SSDD.

                Indians coming to America either maintain the entirety of their culture or go hyper-secular. Frankly the latter is more terrifying. Similarly, as much flak as fundamentalist Muslims get, they are far less dangerous than their woke converts. The converts feel the need to signal submission to power like you wouldn’t believe and there are no brakes on what they will do to gain social status.
One of my neighbors is a traditional Muslim, and his wife was raised Muslim but is now completely secular. I can work with the guy, but his wife terrifies me.

                        In this country, what choice does he have?  Divorce is his only option, or I guess he could try to move her back to a Muslim country where he could get her back under control.

                            Traditional Islam is about appearances. Men supposedly are running the show. However, it appears that women really run most of everything that is not politics, even if in some countries they are wearing some garbage bags in public. I note that garbage bag fashion means that older women need not compete with younger and pretty ones.Such a wife is not an embarrassment in the US. If she has job/career, quite often that would make her a high status wife. She also does not to be provided for. Shoulder shrugs will do here.

                    I have several friends, good people from South Asia, whose children became rabid shitlib activists at the age of 10. That is right. At the age of 10. They celebrate their activism. I think this is driven by the wives and the cucked husbands. Now the kids are in fancy college prep schools and headed for insertion into the Hive. Well, provided there is a place to insert them. If the Hive lives in its current form, bots will be taking the place of the sinecures by these spawn are of age.This shitlibbery is attractive to the women as the anti-male part of it . Of course, there is only advantage in also pushing the anti-White part of it, so they end up going all the way.This is what happens when you permit legal immigration into a shopping mall. They come here for jobs and then find themselves as non-white living in an anti-White milieu. So, the second generation feels not gratitude but gets status, advantage and emotional charge out of joining the destruction of the society that treated their grandparents and parents better than they were treated in the home country.America was a petri dish for creating an employment zone and shopping center in place of a country. It is things like these anti-White, anti-America 2nd generation folks that are yet another sign of utter failure.

                I too prefer the blood and soil Juanita to a Pajeet, but they are not in the elite academic and corporate circles, hence the talented white guys who can’t find traditional white brides marry Asians. It’s a hell of a choice, but at least the tribal Hindus are a check on the intolerant Jewish elites currently ruling America.

                    One thing you will rarely see an actual talented white man doing is marrying an Asian, East or South. Can you imagine a guy like Trump using an Asian as anything but a quick lay?
The sorts of white guys who pick those types of women are pretty much invariably weak cucks who need the most docile possible women in order to breed, and all it costs them is having their sons become hapa supreme gentlemen like Eliot Rodgers.

                        Young men in America today looking for a compatible mate will find slim pickings. The cities, the college campuses, women you meet at work are majority Woke feminists. Loneliness, being alone, is a depressing place to be. So what’s a guy to do? He finds an immigrant woman whose more traditional value system is more in alignment with his own. It’s not ideal, but better than being alone or married to a crazy tattooed American cat woman who may decide    that your son is actually male.

                            If the system wasn’t misandrist you could maybe bully the white chicks into being a bit more tolerable (though let’s be honest, Millenial and later guys aren’t exactly perfect), but you risk getting the Amber Heard treatment, without the finances and star power to defend yourself.

                    “at least the tribal Hindus are a check on the intolerant Jewish elites currently ruling America.”???  Brahmins are discount Jews. If you have money and power, it’s because God loves you (TM) as a Brahmin. The social system of Hindiusm is indisguishible from that modern Judaism.There are 3 groups at the tippy tops of US income, per Pew Research:-Jews-Psyberterians/Reform-Hindus, of largely the Brahmin casteThat said, unlike Jews they cannot easily blend into European society. The more of them that appear, the less likely they are to change their names, etc. Jews can influence in the background. Pajeet sticks out compared to Europeans (and of course vis versa).At some point it being ruled by foreigners becomes far more obvious than it did under Jewish rule.

                Yes, the one major flaw in Vance is the Hindu influence, because the Hindus have demonstrated that they are even more ethnocentric than the jews… Though the two top castes are considerably smarter than the Juans of this world, I would not like to be living in India….

                        Pajeets don’t show the (minor) virtues of the Tribe, however I don’t find them as close to being objectively evil re: The Holodomor, porn industry, various slave trades etc.
So I’d still say Shlomo &lt; Shi’tavious &lt; Pajeet &lt; “Other” &lt; Long Wang/Sakura &lt; Joe Blow

                            The bit you’re missing is that Quantity has a Quality all of its own. There’s a lot more money-grubbing Patels and crazy smart weirder than Yuval Noah Hariri South Indian Brahmins than there are Tribe members on this third rock from the sun.Two things to remember about Indians:1) They’re a totally matriarchal culture (like Jews used to be and still are in all their jokes) despite the stupid faux heroics in their trashy movies. The women rule them.2) And their women are the worst amongst the screeching vanguard of the woke. Not great thought leaders but very push second tier adopters and promoters of every kind of wokeness. They don’t generate the really dangerous bad ideas (Usual Suspects and deviant Whites do that) but they will enthusiastically push them with a work ethic puts woke Whites and Jews to shame.Could they be turned if Dissident Rights owned the media and promulgated a new morality? Perhaps. But why take a chance? They have to go back.

                            The great advantage the Indian immigrants have over others RIGHT NOW is that the speak pretty darn good English. That is an irreplaceable legacy the British left them, like it did for all their colonies, the US included! Blacks from Jamaica are not very numerous in the US but they have this advantage, too. Just look at dear Kamala Harris — she’s a twofer;-) Compare these folks with the French-speaking immigrants: Haitians; French-Canadians; those from the Congo, etc., ignoring for now certain racial disparities. Yes, the offspring of Chinese immigrants are browbeaten by their families to achieve academic success, but they are not as socially mobile as the Indians, who have taken to American politics like ducks to water. The Indians are clannish and publicly flashy, whereas the Chinese think that’s bad form!

                It might very well be that White racial ”purity” as promoted in DR circles is dead.  The best that can therefore come about is a racially blind immigration system based upon the needs of American society in the future.  Hopefully resembling a meritocracy.  It was once that way, except there were quotas attached to countries/nationalities of origin, but your “skills” were judged wrt need and employment.So yes, one can imagine many Indian immigrants from high castes coming in, but that is balanced by a reduction in low IQ dirt scrapers from the third world.  In some respects, this might look like the environment I left at the University.  Faculty, albeit still majority White, were a mix of racial backgrounds from all over the (educated) world.  This meant Chinese, Indian, and yes, European—but few Blacks.

                    It’s not that it is dead, it’s that it hasn’t been born yet because the idea of a purely racial identity not being forged by being an oppressed minority is stupid.Black can work because blacks spent multiple successive generations being treated solely by race. No one gave a shit whether their slave was an Igbo or a Zulu. Whites have not been through anything comparable to have forged a similar identity, it was always just a negative identity to “black”. It may be that down the road, white becomes a real identity, but it will take generation of being the dumped on minority for it to happen.Way too many of America’s problems stem from people in the 20th century pretending an Italian or a Pollock is the same thing as an Englishman or a German.

                        Genetically and in every other respect, a Pollack is the helluva lot more like a Limey than he is like a Chink or a Hutu. And most of the problems whites face today stem from a refusal to hoist in this very obvious truth.

                        Well, that’s the glass half full observation.  As good as mine.  Folks here downvote ideas not to their liking/desire, but nonetheless are of valid observation/concern.The DR concept of Race Realism has yet to take hold and at the rate we are progressing, may never reach a critical mass.  It seems entirely possible, perhaps probable, that immigration reform comes about in a form that does not consider race, but rather “quality” of the applicant solely.  Quality of course needs to be discussed, but it won’t be race.This would solve the problem of race differences discussion—which to date is not an acceptable topic for the majority of the population.  And how could it be, when the White race declines precipitously and the minority races of Black and Hispanic—and who knows what else—proportionally increases to Whites?Not a pleasant thought for those here, but not an unreasonable prediction from current observations.

                            I upvoted your comments because they are reasonable and within the range of possible outcomes.  However, minority tribalism would need to disappear for this path to result in an acceptable compromise.  Given that IQ disparities are stubborn things, I do not see this happening anytime soon.  I believe our more likely best outcome is something like we see in Alabama/Mississippi/Louisiana where the black population is over 30%, but the states are deep red due to whites being very race realistic based on their close daily interactions.

                                Agreed. And I freely point to the unspoken problem in *my observation*—that of “regression to the mean”. In short, every race category has its outliers. Those are the ones we will encourage to apply for immigration.Good bet that the offspring of two higher IQ immigrants won’t reach the intellectual level of their off-the-scale parents, but instead decline to or reflect something between the average of the parents race and that of the (high status) parents.But in any event, it certainly is better than the millions flooding in now whose only ability is fogging a mirror. It looks like from my (conservative) estimates we are adding at least 1-1.5% increase in population yearly (approx 5M) due to legal and illegal immigration. No country can withstand/absorb this influx long term without societal collapse.

                        You are completely wrong when talking about the U.S. Canada and Australia. There has been so much mixing for so long the old conflicts have been forgotten and even if they weren’t how would you tell who is who? However, you are right when discussing Europeans. It hasn’t been nearly long enough for them to forget their past wars, and so you will never, in your lifetime, get a Frenchman to say he is the very same thing as an Englishman or a German.

                        I don’t know about that. It seems like a lot of pajheets would be allowed in through meritocracy. I forget the name of the case, but it was a Supreme Court case that said there is nothing wrong with discernment bye national background when it comes to immigration. Everything can be fixed legislatively.

                        Merit could serve as a proxy for race, if we were reduced to going that route on immigration. Much would depend on the definition of merit.

                            Somewhat of a proxy, yes.  However, TempoNick is on the correct tract.  Every race has its outliers.  India especially if Reich’s analysis of the population genetics is correct.  Indeed, those who fear more “Pradeep’s” are absolutely correct.  There are a few high caste populations within India aside from the well known Brahmin caste.  These people are smart enough to immigrate under any system that does not define strict racial quotas.

                                If we were creative enough, we could tweak the merit tests in ways to restict immigration by high-caste subcons. Ideally, of course, only white immigration or almost white-only immigration would be allowed. That’s why I said “reduced to.”

                                            Brain drain is a long discussed issue.  I’d as soon reduce immigration to even less numbers, and certainly leave out anything resembling non-merit based resident VISA’s—and no, just because you immigrated does not mean all your family can come over to join you.
On the other hand, we already have our businesses forming divisions in other countries to take advantage of their cognitive elite.  So there is no easy solution.

                White populations are falling rapidly, so if you seek a political solution then you are required to seek allies, and in a racial conflict those allies will be other races. An acceptance and alliance with “Asians” may be our only political hope. You may find yourself saying Asian immigration is good, to get the support of those Asians.

                                That’s fine, but clarity in discussion—especially when it drifts from immigration to societal norms and such.  Right, we don’t want “others” if possible, but if not…

                    A thin reed, but Indian upper castes are an Aryan admixture, as are the mestizos.Another small plus is that their religions preserved far more of the ancient proto-Aryan sciences than did the socio-political cant of the Habiru (they didn’t have meteors smashing the place to smithereens.)
Since Nature’s intent is relentless, that is, to spread the upgrade (us), we might become as the jews; retaining consanguinous cores of breeders to replenish the constant assimilation of an outbreeder majority.

                        “Aryan” stuff is just made up academic junk from the early 20th century. It’s a way to replace God for Europeans and give them a way to throw away their immediate history and heritage. Pajeet is not our ancestors. Even if he were, he’s way too different to make a compatible society.The discussion of India is where already dubious Aryan theories fall on their face.

                            Not entirely made up. The Indo-Europeans seem to have originated somewhere in northern India and the Aryans were an offshot that migrated to Iran (the word comes from Aryan) and later into Europe. Now does that make us natural boon companions with Rajiv and Deepika? Certainly not. But we do share genetic material, and you can’t say that about most other non-European peoples.

                                Not to get into some sort of physiognomy argument, but simply look at JD Vance’s wife’s facial features in her image spread on Google.  I could take pretty much any photo and with simple coloration changes in Photoshop turn her into a “White” person.Not intending to be snide here or provocative.  I live in a predominately Hispanic town in the Southwest.  The Hispanic community has many good looking women of Indio-Spanish heritage, but I’d be hard pressed to modify most images through coloration alone to anglicize them.  They simply don’t have the features.This is pretty much what I remember from years dealing with Indian students in my former department.  Indeed, the general perception from White males I dealt with was that these foreign “co-ed’s” were very favorably viewed as to their femininity as compared to the standard American fare we interacted with.  I suspect, Vance was no different if he met her a Yale.

                        South Indian Brahmins (smartest of the smart, lords of Silicon Valley) are Dravidic and not remotely Aryan.That being said, the whole Aryan bit is clutching at straws. You might want a country with zero non-White immigration. You’re not going to get it from the present ruling Elite and you also won’t get it if the PayPal Mafia and Musk (Vance being their sock puppet) get to run the joint.What you might be able to get is more say over who gets in. And in that happy circumstance, I’d be looking at more East Asians and a lot fewer South Asians. Of course that would mean deciding not to start World War 3 with China — big ask for the Big Brains who rule over you, but perhaps they could be convinced.

                            You have it backwards. The Aryans (Iranians) invaded northern India c.1500 BC. Real Brahmins (the kind who don’t need or want to emigrate) are very white skinned, not brown at all, unless it’s a suntan.

South Indian Brahmins run much of Silicon Valley. They are nothing at all like North Indian (Aryanish) Brahmins.
South Indians are Dravidian. Totally different genetics and different non Indo-European language families.
The wealthiest people in India tend not to be North Indian Brahmins — Parsees and Jains to name two groups. North Indian Brahmins tend to be Civil Servants, Lawyers, that kind of thing — not money grabbers like Patels, or tech CEOs like (say) the Iyers. Caste == mini-race == Destiny.

                                    Parsee is a Hindi corruption of Persian. The Parsees, mostly confined to Bombay, are a remnant of ancient Persians who settled in India and they still practice Zoroastrianism. Freddie Mercury, improably enough, was a Parsee.

                                        I’m aware of that fact. Many of the wealthiest Indians traditionally were Parsis (e.g. Tata clan).There’s still a bunch of them sitting on a pile of money in Hong Kong — arrived with the British, founded the bank which became HSBC, did very well in the opium trade, etc. I don’t think it qualifies as a full-on Fire Temple, but they have some kind of religious centre here.The Parsi remnant in Iran seems to be fairly well tolerated by the Mullahs.. again one of those things which jar with the propaganda we’re fed by GAE media.We focus on the Usual Suspects a lot for all the usual reasons, but, as your post implies, there’s so many curious little minorities with interesting histories.

                This shiznat with Ron Howard having made a movie about JD Vance, way the heck back in 2020, simply stinks to high heaven.My guess is that the Sodomite Paedophile Industrial Complex, which controls the GOP***, has had their eye on  JD [JenDer-fluid] Vance since forever.In turn, that would tend to imply that Ron Howard did indeed have to bend the knee &amp; perform the fellatio on the circumcised erections of Hollywood, in order to have a career as a movie director in the United States.Poor Ron Howard was probably being molested as early as the Andy Griffith Show.For a few precious years there, before she ballooned up into Beluga status, Bryce Dallas Howard was a frigging smoke-show.===============***To their credit, DEM politicians tend to prefer little girls, as opposed to GOP politicians, who are obsessively fixated on molesting little boys.Back in the day, if anyone had told me that Ronald Reagan’s GOP would eventually become the party of the pederasts, I woulda thought that that was sheer insanity.

            Impossible to say anything with any surety right yet. I am more informed about American politics than the average Canuck – and I had no idea who this guy is or was. He stinks to high heaven: supposedly raised in poverty and squalor, with a psychotic family… usually kids from those childhoods end up in jail or doing low paying mundane jobs at best. But I am supposed to believe he bravely rose above his circumstances, and rose to prominence in the Marines and other organizations on pluck and merit alone?Pull my other finger! That’s like the Disney movies showing me that blacks are scientists, miracle workers and great leaders. Or the girl bosses. Or the queers and pedos.Trump has replaced Pence with another treacherous apparatchik Unless Trump is ready to crack skulls and stretch necks all indicators are that he will get even less done in his second term. The machine is on to him and if they can’t remove him – they will just tie him up until he can be replaced.

                Too harsh.  I know nothing about Vance, but if he is one of the “smart ones”, it is entirely possible he rose above his early life circumstance.  I can speak of that from experience.  My background in life is completely lower (no) class up until I entered university. I don’t pat myself on the back here, much has to due with Providence, and less to do with me.  Nonetheless, there is nothing in my biography to suggest good things were in store for me at birth.

                    I’m from the same milieu. First person in my family to graduate from college, and in doing so I dealt with the reverse snobbery so common to the white working class. Now I’m obviously no JD Vance, but it is entirely possible for base-born whites to–in the felicitous phrasing or Tarl Cabot–climb the greasy pole.

Zed sed:
“They wanted someone who was more clearly on their side, even though such a person does not exist.”
Which was basically my point yesterday that upset people.
I sympathise with Devon Stack in thinking the shooting, and Trump in general, is anti-accelerationist; Trump keeps the Goyim on the plantation (and Vance moreso) but I think Trump is still destructive to The System as a whole.

                Everything about Vance screams “groomed for the Deep State”. Granted the man’s bona fides of an impoverished childhood the fact is Grandma and Grandpa must have been very wealthy indeed to pay for both Ohio State and a Yale JD. You don’t get that kind of tuition benefit from a four year enlistment. His formation is not unlike Clinton’s when you think of it.If he had been especially talented the Marines would have slotted him in something besides being a reporter and he would have majored in something besides political science. Deep state agent probably from his active duty days.

                As I said over on Bayou Renaissance Man where my motto isÉpater les Boomers,Vance pulled himself up by his bootstraps by not impregnating siblings or cousins in his ancestral in-bred Appalachian mountain fastness. He also did well by surviving an enlisted tour in the military and doing well in his GI Bill undergrad. Somehow he got into Harvard Law as ‘White Trash’ — if he did this under his own steam then even better… but likely he got a big leg up at this stage from Claremont-aligned talent scouts.After that it was all a matter of being the right kind of package and saying the right things to the right people and Bob’s Your Uncle. Amy Chua who runs a big Introduction to Influential People sideline racket took him under her wing, later Thiel invited Vance out to California and set him up with a slam dunk job in VC so that Vance could be sheep dipped as not just self-made but very successfully wealthy self-made.The rest is history. He’s a creature of the Thiel/Musk axis, Palantir / NSA, Musks’ SpaceX / NRO (or whatever agency), etc.. etc.Best deal American Whites can get at this moment, so don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. Just know who the horse belongs to.The irony of Z-Man calling Claremont a Y-Combinator for Vance types is that the real Y-Combinator seems to be totally in the can for the Biden Regime if Paul Graham’s Twitter feed is any indication. Still, Billionaires like Graham can be brought to heel. It’s just a matter of attaining Power first.

                    Zaphod, I concede you know his background in detail. My research was just a quick Wiki. I admit I often speak in bald assertions, but c’mon Zaphod, weren’t you in the service? I’ll admit I haven’t checked, my during my 80s service the GI Bill equivalents were nowhere near generous enough to pay for four years even at a State university. Men enlisting cricially in-demand fields may receive lavish tuition or other kickers, but to believe that “media specialist” requires much talent rather stretches credulity. He probably received some type of intel training. Being a “reporter” is one of the oldest covers in the spook business. I’ve never had any intel connections beyond reading spy novels, unless you count hearing stories growing up in the DC suburbs, and even I know that, for crying out loud.All the same, credit where due: For whatever reasons, the young man was selected and preened for greater things from his early 20s. And his subsequent career path was laid out like a red carpet. He’s a Deep State apparachik with Dirt People “roots”. Don’t fall for it.

                        If he kicked tail in high school and aced his SAT, chances are good he got at least a partial scholly to Ohio State. If not, GSLs. As for Yale, well most people get a free ride at the Ivies because not many people could attend otherwise, and certainly not their diverse pets.

                I put “Asian” in quotes for reasons similar to what you wrote. A lot of times in the media they will paint with a broad brush describing anybody who comes from east of the Urals as an “Asian.” I think they are trying to gloss over the fact that somebody’s a Packi or an Indian by using that word to confuse them with Oriental Asians.

                That’s really the gist of it. Granted, I’m hardly thrilled Vance is married to a subcon and has a son named Vivek. However, if his ideology and policy preferences substantially align with the DR, that trumps his marriage. And if what Z says about Vance is true, then the evidence suggests he is fairly close to the DR, subcon wife notwithstanding.Like most on the DR, I yearn to don the Phrygian cap, spit on my hands, hoist the black flag and begin cutting throats. But until the times are propitious for such behavior, we must make do with imperfect vessels of white identitarianism. What do you want? An egg in your beer?

                    One can hope—with caution wrt “hope” as I’ve noted.  I only add that everything is at stake here.  Trump, I believe has noted that no matter how successful he is in his (third?) election to the office, his job is going to take longer than he has time on this earth.
I myself believe he understands this and has appointed an heir to his legacy (if he makes one).  It will take three terms at least to right this country and that’s if all goes well with domestic policy and world events.  There are many “spiteful mutants” to contend with.

                    “Vance is married to a subcon and has a son named Vivek….”Overlooked this comment in first reading.  I wonder if Vance uses this name in interaction with son?My mother thought it would be the greatest thing to give me an ethnic name.  She named me after my grandfather in Europe.  My father hated it and never address me as such, nor allow such to be used, or even written down on paperwork he handled.  When he came here, he was serious about leaving the “old world” behind.  Hell, I’m not even bilingual.I did not even know my given name until I once needed to bring my birth certificate somewhere.  Then the story from father concerning naming.  Till this day, even on passport, my name remains anglocised.  Only my birth certificate shows my mother’s preference.  😉

                        Yes the Euro immigrants of the first half of the 20th century couldn’t shed their Old World trappings quickly enough. For the most part they really wanted to assimilate and did so. Compare and contrast with today’s immigrants and invaders.

            I just don’t think people understand the disaster interracial marriage is.  The statement it makes, the confusion it brings, identify issues, the loyalty it questions, the philosophy of indifferentism it proposes. A regular, real marriage says very little about a man. But this is not just a fashion-of-the-times, it’s a serious thing. It was illegal for good reason. It’s a society and culture killer.Are her parents and the problems of her people’s homeland NOT a concern for him? This shows the poorest of judgments and  selfishness . Not for her, this is a step up for her, cause her children are Indian.Why wouldnt israel be at the top of his priority if he has knitted his soul to a foreigner? There is no black there is no white there only humanity, so screw your nation, raysiss!phew! Got that out of my system!

                Yes, intermarriage is selfish, especially for the male. From the POV of the nation, it would be better if he stayed single and was at least free to help his nation.Vance is safely one of the globalists, because of that mixed marriage with the upper class career wife. Trump, like or not, is just as part of that global elite. It would not surprise me that his wife is the reason why Trump is betting on unknown.If I can also make a note here, Catholics politically are all over the board. There are Catholics reactionaries like myself interested in nationalism. However, obviously the name “Catholic” suggests certain ideas imbedded into the faith. Modern Catholicism in it’s pop culture has no tools to have him think of the US as anything more than UN shopping mall that the global elites already think of it as.

                    If what X-22 report says is true, the Secret Service staff was essentially a bunch of temps. Not the B team, but the F team as he puts it. Crooks got kicked off of his shooting team in high school because he was a comically awful shot. (I forget if it was yesterday’s podcast or today’s.)After listening to the last two podcasts, I’m even more convinced that I’m on the right track. What happened over the weekend was fake, but it was a reenactment of what already happened before (real).That’s not what X22 report says, by the way. He’s telling the story as if it’s real, yet at the same time he relates back Q posts to what happened and that tells me it’s a reenactment.

        At this point my willingness to support Trump and Vance boils down to Ukraine.  Both Trump and Vance seem inclined to end the conflict on the most favorable terms Ukraine can get (probably the loss of four oblasts and Crimea and neutrality guaranteed by Russian presence monitoring the remnants of the Ukraine military, but the continued existence of the Ukrainian state). If Ukraine doesn’t agree, Trump and Vance would cut off the funding.  The fact that the Europeans seem terrified of Trump and Vance is another reason to support them.  Biden, by contrast is likely to do something borderline insane, such as direct intervention of the American military and a definite possibility of escalation into a nuclear exchange.  A nuclear exchange would make the rest of the issues of the election totally irrelevant.

            If there is any reason to vote, you just nailed it. I have decided to opt out again, but if Trump/Vance lay out explicit plans for winding down the Ukraine insanity I may revisit my decision.

                Vote anyway because even without an explicit plan their being in office will sober up the crazies in the EU and NATO and the support will dwindle to nothing. All the crazy talk about mobilization and more money for defense will go away when the elites realize they are risking their lives. It hasn’t sunk in for them yet but it will.

        Vance was the best pick of the likely alternatives, and maybe even the best pick overall. Certainly better than Nikki Haley or Marco Rubio.What I admire about Vance is he has a Machiavellian streak, as Michael Anton might describe it. He played the game very well, like Barack Obama, and cultivated serious people by allowing them to project their own assumptions onto him, without actually declaring his intentions, one way or another. Also like Obama, he has used various names and identities to climb the greasy pole (hopefully not literally).Which brings me to Peter Thiel. Many on the right are suspect of this connection, and Vance’s ties to Silicon Valley generally, but the sad fact is the only way to beat a ruling elite is with another elite. I would prefer that the incipient elite not be spergy and gay, but as another man I used to admire once said, “You go to war with the army you’ve got.”Hopefully, Vance’s career will follow a better trajectory.

            This. We weren’t going to get any better. He brings money, which unfortunately is very important. The intra-Elite competition is emerging and of course this is essential to victory. I’d worry about the rest of it in 3 years.

                Seems to me she’s almost irrelevant as long as she’s not Angela Davis.  Theymarried in 2014 when Trump was barely getting his toe in the running waters. He was completely invested in her pre-escalator, but she didn’t bail through his entire head journey (assuming it’s real and it seems to be within the context of trying to start within the system).

                    That’s another thing. Are Indian women enamored of divorce rape, like Filipinas are?
I don’t think they are. Someone once pointed out on Heartiste that a handsome Sikh guy will take one for the team, and marry an ugly wife. Kids and relations are more important to him.
If we need to tribe up, if we need allies, if we need to emulate an intensely political culture, maybe having some Brahman influence might be the necessary kick in the ass.

                        Vance apparently is a serious Catholic. If she is a serious Catholic (likely), there will be no divorce.Also, I have to say there is nothing more disheartening than reading  people who are “We need to save the White people” and then immediately shift into “Well, Indians are not all the bad”Come on guys. Not picking on you in particular, but these this need to have anyone come save us is about our weakness right now.  There are less materialistic thoughts I can offer hope about. One I cannot is hoping that some other nation will be helpful in preserving ours.

        I don’t really know where Vance stands. I must have read his “Hillbilly Elegy” about seven years back. He hails from the Rust Belt, and his socio-economic background is white lumpenprole. He managed to escape the common destiny of Rust Belt lumpenproles by earning a Yale law degree and going on to a legal career. But he seems to be blaming poor whites in the Rust Belt for what has happened to them (economic and consequently social devastation attendant upon deindustrialisation), and exhorting them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. If you’re looking for ethnic solidarity, he is probably not the man.

            Also, the Yale-story reads as it was his Indian Princess who saved him from being an evil, racist hick like the rest of his tribe. I got Prince Harry-vibes when he described how wonderful and wise his brown savior was.
And I don’t believe he can be trusted with immigration issues either – no person in a mixed marriage can, but in particular not a guy who pussy pedestals his wife.

            Trump has a foreign wife, but at least she’s one of us. I don’t know if I can handle Barack Obama 2.0, the First Lady edition. At this point, I’m kind of hoping the Democrats go back to being their racist selves. That is really our only hope. The Whigs are worthless.

                    100% this. I feel sad reading these comments that so many Americans are “trapped” in the Matrix that is the Continental United States. Europe is NOT the UK, France, and Germany which are equally lost to (((globalism))). Bargaining between ‘which flavor of mud’ is the best tasting to sprinkle on top of the ice cream cone is depressing.Eastern Europeans are quite “white” and based AF. They know what a n-gger is, and will openly state it as such in public no less. Sadly, they are economically stagnant because the aftershocks of Communism take decades to erase and corruption is a problem everywhere. But we are staring down the same barrel as Commies have infiltrated every level of government in the West. Demographically, I don’t see how to course correct without some serious ‘fedpoasting’ behaviors, but if I have to live in an economic shithole full of corruption I would rather do it amongst people with minimum amount of genetic drift from myself as possible.Said in plainer language, I will take Budapest over Baltimore every day of every week, in perpetuity. It is not even a question.

                    Melania is a low status wife in the modern world of globalist elites. High status wives have those mind bogglingly intensive careers, while their children are raised by people who make full time salaries.I think it speaks to Trump’s own status in that elite by the end of his 2nd divorce. Trump also has knack for finding the almost serious but not quite Catholics in that world for help. Melania, Pence (yes, he’s still a traitor, nominal Catholic doesn’t matter), his chief of staff, and now Vance. An interesting pattern that.

                It is shockingly common, especially on the left. Three close friends of mine are absolutely beta and insufferable having melded themselves to their wives rather than visa-versa including all the far left talking points and support of all the woke f-ckery.
I have zero respect for them and their wives are not far behind. One of them basically has told the guy she doesn’t want to be touched anymore by him. I wonder why? Nothing gets a woman more hot than catering to her every irrational demand and emotional wish… 🙄

        I can believe that Vance’s politics have evolved in the last 8 years. Whose haven’t? He’s had his chance to see the clown world borg bare its fangs as have the rest of us and has drawn his conclusions. He married his hindu wife 10 years ago, prior to this evolution. Would his political evolution have led to a personal evolution which made a different choice? Hard to say. The point is he’s young, 39, a work in progress.Speaking of his wife, the judges she clerked for were Roberts and Kavanaugh, ostensibly “conservative” but in truth borg. I’d like it a lot better if she clerked for Alito and Thomas. Still, that should answer charges that she is a shitlib. I do not find it coincidental that she has these connections on her resume. Couple that with his fast rise, at a young age, into the spotlight. A lot of people write memoirs. Not many of them become glowingly reviewed NYT bestsellers. Then he got a job on CNN. As one does. One could get the sense that the Vances were chosen, groomed etc. from a good while back. Probably all the way back to Yale.It could have been worse. Trump could have picked Rubio or Scott. Is there some ideal VP candidate he could have picked who would make us all happy? I’m not aware of one.

Excellent question even though it may be wish casting. I personally know of one such case where there was buyer’s remorse over the dusky wife and hapa kids. It does indicate a serious lapse of judgment.

                That I must agree with you on. Sex is one thing. Marriage and children another. I’ve just looked at pictures of the couple. I certainly wish them well—especially the children.  What this signals to me is that we have a man with no race considerations/concerns at all. I simply don’t think at this (my) stage of race realization—but perhaps not at a younger age either—that I’d enter into marriage outside of a White, Northern European spouse.So what I see here is we have a person—dead to us—wrt anything involving racial awareness in future political decisions. As Ostei pointed out, the best we can hope for are proxies which carry some form of racial awareness. Better than nothing perhaps, but not the goal.

            I had the strong feeling Trump was going to go with Carson, pre-assassination attempt – Carson is completely loyal and would never step out in front of Trump, even accidentally. Vivek (or even Tucker) could easily steal the thunder. Tucker’s invaluable doing what he does best, imo.As for JD, I wasn’t thrilled abt the book – to me it came off as something of a guided slumming tour. But then one of the nastiest pieces of journalism this century was penned in review of it when Kevin Williamson actually gave the game away. He was the first bubble head to express pure vindictive hatred of the specifically white underclass, much like an unhinged Destiny (think tank version). Ball got moved down the field by a year from that piece alone, just as the ball got moved 5 years ahead by the botched attempt on Trump’s life.

            My Senator comes from a small town and attended a regional college with no particular reputation for academic excellence. Instead of attending the law school at the college somehow he ended up at Harvard law. After graduating he returned to his small town for two years of private practice  before running for state representative and then it was off to the races. The system has talent scouts everywhere looking for young people with “potential.”

                “The system has talent scouts everywhere looking for young people with “potential.”Perhaps, but Harvard *does* accept/look for “White Trash”. Their selection criteria does not exclude all Whites out of hand and has slots open for such “underserved” minorities. This developed when they started getting pressure from lowered admission standards for minorities, so criteria switched somewhat from score based, objective measures to “underserved” communities, i.e., ghetto rats and White trash being two communities.  A good sob story goes a long way there and subjective evaluation seems to pass muster in admissions.  Vance may have been a “token” admission to prove the “fairness” of the new biased admission criteria.

            “Trump could have picked Rubio or Scott.”You sold me right there.
A commenter at Micheal Yon (the combat journalist who exposed Mayorkas’ Darien Gap immigration pipeline) credibly speculated that the shooter scenario was an assassination attempt by theRepublicanside, in cahoots with the Obama-laid bureaucracy. Getting Nikki or even Desantis into Trump’s place would’ve buttressed the System.

        The people celebrating Trump getting shot or saying it’s fake and he staged it, these people want him dead and all of us dead also.  They may pull out all the stops and steal it again. We may be able to see the corruption from Mars but not voting at this point because the candidates aren’t perfect it’s just madness. The other side wants your son’s castrated and your daughter’s raped. All your are voting for is the people that don’t want that. It’s not a real hard decision

        I’m willing to accept the possibility that you outlined: Vance was involved in the never Trump stuff because he adopted the politics of those around him. He then had some epiphanies and started moving towards Trump, and even some viewpoints on our side. Heck, everyone on here started somewhere else and ended here ideologically. The list of people he follows on X is interesting evidence to that conclusion that I’ll mull over. HOWEVER…You can’t easily gloss over the married to an Indian woman thing. It’s not just that he married an Indian woman. It was an “interfaith” Hindu-Christian marriage ceremony. As someone that lives in a very lefty part of the country, I can tell you how the overwhelming majority of people who do these interfaith marriages think. Also, how will you raise your kids? You can’t raise them to be both. These kids will be morally and spiritually confused, and it also means he doesn’t take his own religion terribly seriously. Furthermore, I think it’s just as likely that he realized how popular Trump was in his state, and that he’d never get elected without bending the knee to him. He could be the establishment guy that threw on a convenient skin suit because it was necessary in his state.Everyone keeps asking who else did you want? Tucker would have had me excited without a doubt. It would have lit the party base on fire. He was the choice, but maybe he didn’t want it.

            It is also possible that Vance has moved substantially rightward over the last several years and that, if he had it to do all over again, wouldn’t marry the subcon.
We’re all just taking shots in the dark here because reality in the BFE seems to be little more than a semantic field of independent hunches. The only source of truth anymore is a well-calibrated BS-detector.

                His wife is the interior of his life. It will dominate his thoughts and most of his “off” time for the rest of his life. Vance by having a foreign wife is not going to be a nationalist. That’s probably why he was chosen, despite a weird history and other red flags.

Both sides are for sure in Israel’s pocket but at least there are some positive thingsExactly.Some people are pissed that JDV is seemingly so pro-Israel and pro-Jewish. The fact is, no American politician has been allowed into prominence (any higher than say Thomas Massie) in recent decades who hasn’t been. You’re just not in the current day going to get someone willing to fight that fight.That battle was lost when they railroaded Nixon out office. That battle was lost when the Chicago Seven weren’t put away for life, there weren’t more Kent States, and America generally wasn’t more firm with the Jewish takeover of the sixties. That battle was lost when the Buckleyites banished the Birchers. That battle was lost when Joe McCarthy was disgraced and then killed, and more Americans didn’t line up behind him against the real threat he was identifying. That battle was lost when they assassinated Patton and James Forrestal. That battle was lost when no one stopped FDR, Henry Morgenthau, Felix Frankfurter, and others from provoking Japan so that they could get reluctant pacifist Americans to smash Germany. That battle was lost when FDR used the outbreak of war to banish Father Coughlin, James T Flynn, Harry Elmer Barnes, and other influential Americans. That battle was lost when Carl Weiss murdered Huey Long. That battle was lost when Americans allowed Jews to found and grow the ADL, SPLC, ACLU, AIPAC, and (tens of?) thousands of other political pressure organizations. That battle was lost when we threw open the gates of Ellis Island to the Ashkenazi, and gained the atomic bomb and other wonders, at the faustian cost of our nation.Maybe that war will be refought in the future. This is one reason why I see the hard left’s agitation against Israel’s war of extermination as one of the most hopeful developments in modern AmericaThat said, I think JD Vance is on our side as much as he can be. He’s not responsible for the last 140 years of American history, and it’s not helpful to hate him for being a creature of his times.

        Vance bears the hallmarks of a true toady who has been snatched from a low background, groomed, and installed for oligarchical service. I have worked with and for such amphibians. Vance can never lead a genuine reform let alone revolution. Bend over for the next fifteen million invaders, the talk will be potent but the action will not deliver the medicine. I oppose Vance and will vote Biden to accelerate. To Hell with these muppets.

            Staying home is something I am seriously contemplating. I don’t know if I can cross over to the dark side and vote for Biden. Maybe if JD does enough stupid things to piss me off.

        Trump’s pick of Vance bought me another election cycle. I thought it was a terrific pick, and most notably, it finally exposed Nick F as a sputtering little goblin: the goy Ben Shapiro.
If the system can be saved, big IF, we’ll need Vance and Gaetz and Massie and Theil and Musk money. Not our guys of course, but like they say, Gaetz didn’t get me cancelled for being edgy online.
After the recent elections in the UK and France, however, I do think this is the actual Flight 93 election. If Trump loses, the Borg has won.

            I view the UK and particularly French elections as precursors to revolutionary times. There almost certainly will be a pro-white government elected in France next go-round and a likely civil war to follow.

                Marine Le Pen is not pro-white. None of the so-called far right parties in Europe are, with the possible exception of Golden Dawn in Greece.
The civil war comes when enough people realize this.

                        I must admit I know less about her crown prince than I do about Vance, but I very much doubt he’d be in the running for leadership if he was some kind of rogue.Le Pen ousted her own father (the founder of Front National) because he called Israel “a shitty little country in the Middle East” and that the Holocaust was “a detail in WW2-history” – both objectively true facts.(Jean-Marie Le Pen, incidentally, was in the paratroopers during the Algerian War, and served in general Aussaresses’ clandestine torture-and-mayhem squad, an Operation Phoenix-type outfit. He participated in at least two massacres of fellahin fighters, and helped bury the bodies far out in the desert. Aussaresses noted that Le Pen was careful to bury them with their feet facing Mecca, as per Mohammadan tradition.)

                        No, although they do nothing to dissuade people from that misconception. AfD, as the rest of them, are civnats and Israel Firsters.Next time you hear one of these types speak about immigration, pay attention to the qualifier they put right before “immigration.” In America the qualifier is usually “illegal”, for AfD, it’s “Moslem” and for Marine, it’s “chaotic” or “uncontrolled”.For some reason, globalists plants are not allowed to outright lie on this point and tell you they’re against mass migration, they need that plausible deniability the qualifier gives them, in case they should ever garner enough power to deliver on the expectations.It’s like Trump with his big, beautiful door in the big, beautiful wall: people only hear “wall”, they don’t hear the “door”-part.

                                No Mohammadan ever opened our borders to Moslem mass migration. The Mohammadans are just a weapon the gate-openers wield against us, they are not the enemy himself.Once we win and regain control of Europe, re-migration will be a trivial problem that could be completed in a few decades with minimal weeping and gnashing of teeth, except from the shitlibs.Economic incentives brought them here, economic incentives can make them go home – and the tax cattle must suffer or he learns nothing.

The usual suspects (of the Mercantile Venetian variety) are happy for people to cry over jihad and dhimmitude but they wont let anyone do anything constructive about it.
There’s plenty of evidence it gives cover for ‘glassing the diaperheads’ though. To the benefit of Greater Yidsrael, naturally.

Just so. With the left hand, you usher in the Mohammadans and tell the locals they’re obliged to love and respect them.
With the right hand, you tell the locals they’re all terrorists who rape their daughters and beat their wives and want to establish a caliphate.
Psychologically, it’s like kicking your dog in the balls every time you give him a treat.

                                I dare say European girls who’ve been raped by Sand Hutus might differ with you on their not being the enemy. From a practical standpoint, the guy pulling a knife on you is always your enemy regardless of how he came to be standing in front of you.
And I suspect it will be much easier to convince the European public that the Muzz must be expelled than the Finkels, which I presume is the actual enemy to whom you allude.

                                    Girls are raped all the time, big deal. The kosher-right rakes in millions by dealing in such inter-racial snuff porn and in the bargain they demoralize whitey. I read the statistics and draw my conclusion on that basis, I don’t need photo montages of girls who were raped and bludgeoned to death, or videos of Swedish boys being forced to kiss a Mohammadan shoe sole.I’m not terribly fond of Mohammadans for a number of reasons beyond them being in my country, but most of them are a lot more civilized than niggers and, in some respects, even Hispanics, since they don’t drink and their girls don’t dress like streetwalkers. Most of the really gruesome rapes are by Africans, sometimes Pakis.They need to go home, of course, but the kosher right uses their insalubrious cultures to distract you from what matters: closing the borders. People like Tommy Robinstein, Nigel Farage and Douglas Murray play this game excellently, they redirect your rage at being replaced onto the Mohammadans.it will be much easier to convince the European public that the Muzz must be expelled than the FinkelsThat’s because the Finkels run the propaganda machine. If people understood it was the Finkels who brought the Moslems here, they’d be run all the way to the border at the end of a cattle prod.

                                        Not just the Finkels. Leftist whites are equally to blame, possibly more so. And seeking to expel the Sand Hutus does not gainsay the wisdom of ejecting a few other groups, too. It is simply one phase of the same project. Sending the Muzz packing is a big step in the right direction and is preperatory to the general whitereconquete. If you condition whites that repatriating one group is kosher–so to speak–then they will be more likely to take similar action against other groups.

        The man who emerged from the pages ofHillbilly Elegywas a slimy, insufferably smug little backstabber more than ready to shit on the Whites impoverished by Globalism in exchange for a seat at the Eunuch’s Table at Davos. This little boot licker clawed his way into Yale; does anyone imagine the connections he madethereshare any of the beliefs of the readershiphere?But now he has changed, struck down by the dissident light on the road to Damascus D.C.?It seems very, very unlikely to me.The Perfect Dissident Candidate may not exist but it becomes a question of degree.  “The saltine crackers are all stale anyway, so why would you object to this turd served on a sheet of sandpaper?”Anyone treating his street shitting wife as an unimportant detail has repudiated White interests by default. Pleading expediency only makes it doubly repugnant.

            “Anyone treating his street shitting wife as an unimportant detail has repudiated White interests by default.”You’re the helluva writer and I enjoy reading your posts. However, that statement is unsubstantiable hyperbole. To begin, I don’t think any of us are saying the subcon wife is unimportant. Rather, we’re saying that if indeed Vance is approaching the DR ambit, she’s not a deal-breaker.And the fact is, none of us really now where Vance’s head is at just as we don’t know where most non-Leftist political elites’ heads are at. Are they squishes, cucks and backstabbers? Or are they perhaps the vanguard of the movement we’ve been campaigning for? Because such people swim in shark-infested waters and the Left has a monopoly on dissemination of information, they have to keep their cards close to the vest, particularly if they’re true rightwingers. So, we just don’t know.﻿Are you willing to take the chance that Vance is useful? I think I am. And doing so doesn’t mean I’ve “repudiated white interests.” In fact, I resent the accusation.

                The aspect of the wife being a fundamental figure, as in the women controlling the man, seems premature in the absence of some supporting evidence.  As I’ve said many times, my wife brings important insight in her right—especially wrt people and a sense for personal relationships.  She complements me in such areas.  But in other areas she does not and does not even attempt to “meddle”.How is it that we, on the “other side of the divide”, have such great respect for our positions and so little regard for our sex (apologies to the great number of women who lend insight to the commentary here)?  Do we have not enough problems without creating boogeymen?

                To begin, I don’t think any of us are saying the subcon wife is unimportant.Imagine Trump had chosen T. Boone Skeezix as his VP. Little is known about Skeezix, but we do know (by his own admission) that he spent 15 years of his youth and early manhood carrying out cat burglaries and writing numerous books on successfully conning seniors out of their pension money.Once the nomination is announced, the conversation turns to questions of viability for the ticket. “Skeezix may have been our best bet; certainly better than a warmonger like Nikki Haley!”“No coalition with the House Dems would be possible without Skeezix on the ticket!” (Obviously these are exaggerations of the actual conversation).What about the predatory theft, though?Doesn’t that disqualify Skeezix automatically? Seeing how he runs his personal life?Is ignoring his irrefutable history of criminalitynota tacit confession that the matter is not taken at all seriously? In this situation, is ignoring evidence of low character and poor judgment functionally any different than openly advocatingforit?What is the goal here? Simply to win elections? Why, though? For what purpose?I am interested in political power because the legislative steam shovel can shape the world I live in to such an enormous extent. I am interested in political power because I want to use it to protect and uplift my own people, and yes, I am talking about other Whites. I want the State’s monopoly on violence harnessed in defense of Christian morality and traditional societal structures. I want peace, prosperity, and the ruthless subjugation of cancerous ideologues and Satanic nation wreckers pushing their poisonous ideologies from behind the shelter of our thoroughly captured institutions.There is no other reason to evencareabout winning elections.I live in a country that actively discriminates against me. POX are allowed to openly advocate for my dispossession and murder without repercussions, while my life will be ended for uttering the dreaded N word. I don’t have children, but I look at the children of my friends and I shudder for them.Who is responsible for all this? Opinions vary, and I pose the question rhetorically, but there is no question the dusky hordes of Mud World are descending on our still-twitching corpse with slavering jaws and grasping paws.Either a person agrees that this is a bad thing and wants our dispossession stopped, or they do not. Like pregnancy, it is an utterly binary point of view.Someone with an Indian wife has signalledhisallegiances. What else needs to be said? He not only supports our ongoing genocide, he actively participates in it. So what if he and Trump win the election? It would be meaningless, because the ‘victory’ itself negates everything we would like to see accomplished.How can we talk about the ills of DIE one day, then start discussing compromises and probabilities and necessary concessions the day after that?It is compromises, probabilities, and concessions that got us here in the first place.I understand that most who comment here realize its all an illusion. But I am puzzled when those same people slip into Expediency Speech, and start a discussion wherein all their premises are lifted from a Republican convention in 1992, and much earnest theorizing ensues about which candidate will appeal to what special interest group, and how political strategies must inevitably be employed if there’s to be any hope at all of victory,  even if it means cozying up to our literal enemies and replacements.And doing so doesn’t mean I’ve “repudiated white interests.” In fact, I resent the accusationIt was not my intention to be offensive; hopefully my meaning will be more clear now.

                    SDB, we see the same problems and want the same solutions. That’s not an issue. The key to Vance, in this context, is his position on immigration. True, the fact that he married a subcon is not promising. However, that was 10 years ago, and as Z suggested, it at least appears as though scales have fallen from Vance’s eyes and he’s beginning to see sense. And it may well be that he now favors much more restrictive immigration policy than the open-borders bullshit that currently vexes us. We really can’t say for certain where Vance stands on the matter, but at least there’s a fair chance he would be an improvement over the shitheels who’ve dictated immigration policy since 1965.At any rate, I’ve gone on record here many times as stating that we’re in a post-electoral environment, which is another way of saying voting no longer amounts to dicksquat. That being the case, the whole Trump/Vance  issue is a fairly meaningless diversion. On the off chance, however, that who’s in office does still matter somewhat, I’d take Vance over any of the other plausible VP candidates.

        JD knifed his family, his economic class, his racial &amp; regional demographic in the back to the applause of the ruling class who showered him with money for his service. He was such a never Trumper that he even insinuated that Trump was literally Hitler. Then he did a sudden heel turn &amp; adopted all the rhetoric he became rich and famous for denouncing.Oh and he’s totally down to do whatever israel wants because and I quote verbatim, “because of who Americans are.”Where have I heard that before? Oh right “our democracy” &amp; “our values” about fifty thousand times since at least the obama era.Yeah he’s goodun alright, a real maverick even, you could say.I’d take Vivek over him, at least he doesn’t implicitly shill race mixing by parading around a racial alien he mated with like Vance does. They’re both ultimately going to be hindu/israeli supremacists but Vivek is a lot less grotesque than JD in my eyes even if the outcome would be the same regardless.As for Trump I’ll count my blessings if he maintains the same level of limp wristed cuckery as his first term but I doubt that. His spinelessness escalated exponentially as time went on even when he left office so I fully expect his second term to be indistinguishable from a jeb presidency. He might as well have had a D next to his name the last two years he was in office.I’m not looking forward to another four years of conservatives hyping up anti White policies, israel directed warmongering &amp; endless apologetics for gun control &amp; vaccine mandates purely because Trump cosigned it. Unfortunately it seems highly likely that’s coming unless they figure out a way to get blacks excited enough about another biden term to do a repeat of 2020. I’m getting a headache just thinking about it.

            The Republicans are still the enemy no less than the Dems, and Trump’s survival and the Vance pick do nothing to change that. But it is possible that Trance are now closer to the DR than they are to the Republicans.

        One other thing I wanted to add, what is this fixation center right WASPs have with (dot) Indians? The UK Tories love them, center right Australians love them and now the Whigs here in the US.
Curiously, this is a lot like the Whig love affair with the Jews. Indians, like Jews, don’t vote Republican, either.
It’s like the same people run everything. Nah, that would be a conspiracy.

            This country is “browning” so rapidly that time is running out for Whites as a group to have a say in anything.  As more of the swarthies embed themselves into positions of power and influence, our options will continue to decrease.  But hey, we’re just proposition “country” amirite?

            This is what I wrote the other day about it on the Inflection Point post (I’d add that Hindu’s lean Zionist because of Pakistan):I think there is also an undercurrent that Indians get special treatment as a wedge or bribe against the Chinese. By placating or selling out your country to India, you keep them in the Western Sphere, when it would otherwise lean at the very least unaligned, or possibly even anti-Western/Atlanticist.The thing is, one of the major deals made with India is just to let them flood your country, instead of the standard bribes in Central Asia etc. where you simply invest in some infrastructure and a handful of fixers get enriched.India has its own homegrown billionaires and power nexi, after all.Sorry to bore people with the Antipodes, but here Down Undah there is a definite but subtle subtext that the centre-left leans Chinese and the centre-right leans Hindu, especially if you look into who tends to benefit from their respective corruption scandals.I also remember a while back us making some deals with India to get them onboard with AUKUS or pacific containment and a sweetener was sold as “mutual education opportunities” which is obviously just an excuse for millions of coolies to flood in and practice their Bobs and Vergana skills.And the whole UK Conservative Party/Hindu thing over there.

        Let’s assume that you guys are correct and that the assassination attempt was legit. Contrary to popular opinion, this pick gives them even more incentive to whack Trump. If Trump gets whacked, JD is going to have the same problem with his wife that Romney had with his Mormonism. Too much of our base is going to stay home. Probably including me.Honestly, I wouldn’t mind who he’s married to if our immigration were in order. But given what’s happened in the past, I don’t trust this guy at all. Next thing you know, they’ll quadruple the H1B visas and we’ll be flooded with IndiaIncredible.

        A big part of being a dissident is understanding that humans are born different from one another, and that these differences extend to groups as well.  South Asians are, on the whole, radically different from Europeans in terms of aptitude, religious beliefs, political beliefs, etc.  They are also notoriously ethnocentric.  I actually took the time to read Vance’s book, and was sympathetic until I got to the section where he married an Indian.  If he cared as much about his heritage and his people as he claimed to in his book, he would not have done this.  As a result, I simply can’t bring myself to trust him, even if he’s the least bad option out of nothing but bad options.  There is no chance of saving what’s left of the west until the people leading on our side start thinking racially first.

        Vance said the US would look to strengthen alliances between the“Israelis and the Sunni Arab states” to “form a united front against Iran”.Exclusive: Secret Service ramped up security after intel of Iran plot to assassinate Trump.
The oligarchs are creating a Narrative right now.
Let’s hope white americans aren’t so dumb to believe the future cyber attack, which will be blamed on iran, is worth going to war for.

            I don’t think this was yet true when Vance wed his hindu bride, but here today in the year of our Lord 2024, if one is to pair with a white woman of child bearing age, then one must accept her tattoos and all that they signify.
I have little doubt she was a cut above most of the white women he met at Yale

                This is sadly true. If you are white and not yet married and in the DR, you should probably find a white lady. But finding one without tattoos and a body count is very difficult. I can forgive based lads who end up with trad nonwhites. The alternative is inceldom. Life is full of uncomfortable choices.

                True enough. Why, it was only yesterday that many were lamenting the fallen state of white women, and now we’re wailing about Vance marrying a non-white woman. Also, we’re admonished to go forth, be fruitful and multiply.

                    I think the issue is that your average White guy cannot meet an average White girl, pair bond, and start a family. JD Vance is not an average White guy. Reading JD Vance’s Wikipedia, he met his Indian wife at Yale and was persuaded to write his book by “Tiger mom” Amy Chua, wife of Jed Rubenfeld. This is not the world of your average White person. This is the world of the rootless cosmopolitan, one which JD Vance moved into with great skill. I find it tough to believe that a Marine veteran in Yale Law School couldn’t find a nice White woman there, but I suppose I am reaching here.

                            Every now and then I notice an attractive young White girl in my neighborhood. They’re rare as it has now converted mostly into a South Asian tech worker slum. Still, when I see such a girl I immediately start thinking “OK, where are the tats?”. I almost never fail to spot them. I found my wife by an amazing stroke of luck. I have no idea what a young man looking for a “nice White girl” would do.

                Think about it, with Vance’s background he had no chance to hook up with a white at Yale. He was a literal hillbilly with not much in the way of prospects on the surface. Do you think some social register type or a relentless social climber there would have given him a second look? Look, I hate the Pajeet wife thing but that may be understandable.

        I agree totally with this take even though I think the system is beyond reform and doubt it would be desirable to preserve it if that even were possible. You are especially right here:Vance was not a political guy and when he was encouraged to get into politics, he adopted the politics of the people around him. When he got a good look at what those politics meant, he reacted negatively and started down the path that led him to this point. Anyone who has been to a dissident event has heard a version of this story many times.Spot on. Vance certainly is not Our Guy, and is certainly not pro-white, but he has Noticed. So have infinitely wealthier and well-placed figures. Cloud People such as Musk and Thiel are problematic but seem to appreciate their extraordinary wealth and legacies are at risk. They seek a likely hopeless reform, but given systemic revolution would be necessary to preserve Our People (if even such would work), elites would be necessary to go there. It remains to be seen how far they will go, but cracks have opened among those who ultimately matter in the larger scheme of things.It is a horrifying yet fascinating time to be alive.

                I don’t think federalism as contemplated in the Constitution is even possible now. We have ade factoseparation happening within states at an accelerating rate, and that likely will lead to future white enclaves. The Regime is working overtime to prevent and offset it, but time is not on its side, which is why such effort is being put into an otherwise meaningless pageant this fall. A racial form of federalism would work, but that would not be allowed under present circumstances.

                Clouds getting sideways with one another certainly is progress. Musk seems to have been radicalized when his child jumped on the tranny train. Note how he pounced yesterday when Newsome signed into law a prohibition against informing parents about their kids’ whispered perversions. Thiel was outed by Gawker and proceeded to destroy it in a spectacular fashion. The Left’s impulsiveness is its Achilles Heel and that is playing out publicly now.

        At least we get some tiny bit of clarity of what the future through 2028 holds in store for us. It’s no use bemoaning the fact that J.D. Vance has an Indian wife. That train left the station long ago. America as many of us knew it is over. It was over 60 years ago when I was but a child first becoming aware of the dismal miasma of American politics. Our destiny — the destiny of our progeny — doesn’t even lie on this continent. It lies in other lands thousands of miles to the east amongst peoples who are our distant relations from thousands of years ago. These future men in those lands will have time and distance to reflect on the disastrous “American Experiment” and its variants along their western borders with a bemused detachment and using their own recent history as a guide. For the present, we ourselves can only look forward to increasing chaos and disorder in our own land. I’m not suggesting btw that we shouldn’t be involved in our own small spheres of influence as that can only lead to apathy.

            I’m in the process of permanent reversion to my ancestral homeland. It will take many years because my entire life is here in the US. But I consider it worth the time and effort just like my ancestors and many like them, took on the hardship of leaving everything behind and getting on a boat with very little to their name.I will be one of the “men of the East” you mention and I have said, totally seriously, that I intend to spend most of my time educating people about what is waiting for them should they “take the ticket” from the West.The question becomes how much hardship are you willing to endure? Most people are still VERY comfortable and so will gripe on the internet, but will take no real and immediate action in their lives to do anything about the situation. I amnotthat guy.

        “The system” is anti-whiteness. Vivek on the Romans (and Iowa voters) and Vance in his book (and life) have signaled their allegiance to it. Does it need saving? Seems to be doing fine, with or without them. They’re justinto it.Trump’s surrender to that faction of the regime is a sad fate, but it’s probably the least horrible end he’s allowed. Does he know? Did he just find out? Is he so boomer-brained he thinks he’s helping out some young go-getters? I suspect that’s Elon’s error.Anyway, America has a hell of a streak of bad days going, but the last few have been special.

However, the attempt must be made by those with investment in the perpetuation of the system and BE SEEN to be made by the ruled class, before the ruled class cross that line into walking away (inside their heads) from corpse-America.Moreover, historically these kinds of breaks from old orders occur more strongly when things get better after they have been been bad, and then they get worse again, not through random happenstance but from old-order elite misconduct after they regroup and counterattack. Pres. Trump can bring about an economic revival in short order, if he is willing to go Andrew Jackson.Pres. Trump’s cobbled together coalition of nuevo-American merchant clown trash has one chance to get it right. Senator Salazar exemplifies this group for me, a modern neo-Bourbon in line with Metternich’s “They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.” They WILL blow it, as sure as rain. They love money more than they love their own people, and most viscerally hate our people. The RNC is just a collection of backstabbers with short term interests in backing Pres. Trump. It is NOT a civilizational rebirth movement like what Pres. Putin shepherded into a Russian revival.

                This post about sums up what I think about Vance and what will happen when he takes over from Trump. The system will still fall but if we think of the system as a 200′ tall golem, it very much matters which way the corpse falls. I think Trump/Vance give it a chance to fall on our enemies and not us. That’s why I endorse the T/V ticket.

If Trump passed away I can see Vance totally renouncing MAGA and bending over backwards to import as many Subcons as possible, saying stuff like, “They speak better English than most white Americans!”

        Vance, King Cobra and Musk represent a new elite emerging. Sure, they’re part of the system, but you can see how they’re bristling at being just the help. They want a seat at the table, but the tribe won’t allow outsiders into board room. Will be interesting to see where this goes.As to whites, I’d suspect that Vance and Musk have a good understanding of the situation and some sympathy, but it’s not their top priority. King Cobra likely understands why the West is better than India (white people and culture) and prefers the West, so not exactly sympathy for whites but he knows why they’re important.

        I find it hard to believe that Trump picked a guy who took Bill Kristol’s side in 2016, who voted for Evan McMuffin, and who wrote a fawning op-ed for Barack Obama when he left office. If there is anything that shows crystal clear how Trump is not the same guy he was back then, or even in 2020, it is this. Trump is a hobbled candidate who decided he needs to play ball to stay afloat. This entire RNC has actually been a depressing window into all of this. They write off Trump’s “mean tweets” – the things that got him support and got him elected in 2016, despite the fact that they pissed off the regime – and claim he is actually just here to be a standard GOP operative looking for corporate tax cuts and immigration as long as it is LEGAL.That said, the fact that there is an oligarchy that is willing to play ball with him shows some cracks and divisions among the elite, of the sort that has not existed since the end of the Cold War.

        The thing to remember about Vance is that he’s a hillbilly who pulled himself out of Bumblefuck Kentucky to go to Yale and become a lawyerdawg and a success.  Problem is, that’s exactly the sort of person who absolutely hates his own kind, as his ego will have been utterly defined by the idea that he overcame his dirt identity and achieved apotheosis as a cloud person.He’s the perfect example of the bioleninist principle that the regime prefers to use uplifted underclass members since their loyalty is ensured by their fear of getting kicked back down to the gutter should they step out of line.

        Btw, that Murray discussion Lowry gets it wrong when he says, “You are saying there is a threat from the Left and a threat from the Right.”No. Here is what it is for Vance, Lowry and any others who may ever get here.There is a threat from The Left which is now a coalition of anti-White. That threat is an existential threat which wants to eradicate White people and our civilization. Look up Ignatiev, Donald Moss, Scott Potok, Tim Wise etcetera to see what they say. That is they explicitly threaten us with annihilation. Then you have guys like Krugman and his buddies who wrote that book about White Rural Rage who make the threat implicitly but still pretty directly. Then you have Mayorkas, HIAS and NGO after NGO and politician after politician who are carrying out the project through an explicit invasion of anti-White colonizers.Then there are Whites who are not in denial about the threat and take it seriously. We are not threatening we are defending ourselves – currently from a position of total vulnerability and weakness. We have no explicit advocates who hold any position of power. It is totally one sided. So, rather than fear The Right, if you believe that it is wrong to invade and colonize multiple continents that constitute a people’s homeland and to target them for genocide, you should encourage and join the formation of The Right so we can defend ourselves. Yes. That will mean total destruction of those who have moved against us in this way. For Lowry, it is the least you can do given how much blood and treasure we gave to end slavery and allow your people a good life on our shores.

        Vance looks like a Grifter, pure and simple. No real life outside of VC and politics, at least Trump who inherited wealth built stuff greater than his father.Vance is guaranteed to take the Indian side of things over White people, and non-Whites generally over Whites. That is baked into the cake. He has non-White kids so he hates you and wants you dead for being White. Got it.I have very limited wants from the Republican Party: A. No global nuclear war with China or Russia and certainly not both. B. No draft (of only White guys of course) and general wartime mobilization. C. No White tax aka Reparations. D. Some limits to the Open Border and some pushing of the illegals back to where they came from.These are listed in order of importance for me. I think we can get A and B out of them, and that is not in the cards with Team Democrat. So there is that.Inevitably however there will be collapse, i.e. general war with China and Russia as the former inevitably takes not just Taiwan but South Korea, Southern Japan, and Hawaii, and the latter retakes Alaska. We just don’t have the means to defend those places, not the men, not the equipment, and not the means to raise men or equipment. THAT collapse is going to create the collapse of the federal system and various states going their own way; the Soviets like Nietzsche predicted the future, but like the Madman with the lantern in daylight were simply too early.The Soviets long thought that the racial and regional/ethnic difference among Blacks/Hispanics/Whites and among Whites and Hispanics would create this breakup; and Nietzsche famously predicted the death of belief in God. Nothing Vance will do as successor to Trump will change this in any way, the true measure of reform required to do this: MASSIVE deportations, ending anti-Whiteness, massive tariffs and import duties, massive orientation towards manufacturing and energy, and crushing feminism, is simply not in the cards.

            Regarding the conquest of land it seems we are witnessing the 21st century technological stalemate in Ukraine analogous to the trench warfare of the early 20th. Not just drones and missiles, but the theater level AI integrated surveillance making all targets visible and known, and all major offensives virtually impossible. Attrition. So I discount the probability of any prospective Russia/China conquests in this sense. Even if they lack the IT capability of the west (I am sure they are gaining though) the west lacks the industrial capability to advance. So militarily I expect to see stalemate all around so long as things remain conventional. Although the warring parties can strike at each other in dramatic but indecisive ways. The war will be won and lost economically, long before attrition has a chance to be decisive. But, I’m sure some portion of the braintrust has concluded that the way to break the stalemate is with tactical nukes. I’m not saying we wouldn’t get our hair mussed……

            “He has non-White kids so he hates you and wants you dead for being White.”I don’t think he wants you dead, but he probably doesn’t mind the white kids learning lgbt/celebrate sodomy ‘tolerance’ in school while his kids will not be traumatized like that. He may be willing to say POC kids and parents have a different culture so should be exempt while white kids don’t get that privilege. That’s very possible.

        There is only one issue that matters in the upcoming election, and that is the energy issue, specifically its falsification as an environmental concern. The “Green New Deal” and it associated patterns of thought represent an existential threat to civilization in a way that nothing else in our day and age even compares to. No energy, no civilization. Everything else is academic.JD Vance is a strong supporter of the oil and gas industry and he considers global climate change to be a fantasy (which it is). That makes him worth supporting, even if it means we get stuck with someone less than optimal on other issues. This election must be about dismantling the international pseudo-environmentalist cabal. We can discuss the other things later.

                    “Right quick” is part of the problem.  Getting resource like oil and nuclear in place takes time.  In particular if you have destroyed or removed the previous systems to accommodate green crap.
Not saying the other issues are not important.  Perhaps need to address them all.

            “There is only one issue that matters in the upcoming election, and that is the energy issue, specifically its falsification as an environmental concern.”One of many, not the only.  Here’s an intellectual exercise, assume in the *first year* a complete reversal of anti-fossil fuel bigotry and a return to such use and complete “energy independence” as they say.  How would this cure what ails this country?  Would race issues subside?  Would Boeing become smarter and build better planes?  Would our military readiness/effectiveness increase?  Would our aging and failing infrastructure be restored?  Would this even balance the budget?Man-made global warming (global warming is real, just not man-made) is merely a front for implementation of authoritarian world government.  If global warming fear dries up, they’ll find another excuse as they’ve shown since the 60’s when we jumped from food shortages and mass starvation, to pollution, to ice age, to global warming.  The EU is a good example (of a bad example) here.  An authoritative body removed from public accountability and individual country’s citizens traditions and sensibilities.

            People will not willingly and peacefully return to a Thomas Jefferson agrarian lifestyle preindustrial level of civilization, as some hippie dreamer theater majors imagine. The “Green New Deal,” if allowed to gain traction, when it eventually fails will ratchet the temperature of competitive geopolitics to feverish levels and that will almost certainly lead us to nuclear annihilation. The temperature is already rising dangerously (metaphorically speaking of course). That is unquestionably an existential threat to civilization.

            The Monday RNC speaking slate is one of the most depressing and blackpilling political events I have ever seen, especially in context of what happened 2 days prior. I don’t know how anyone on this side can realistically get on board with this party, or get on board with the man who signed off on all of this. Even if he signed off on it before a bullet was a centimeter away from opening his skull, he signed off on it. Yesterday’s was a little better, but the primary message I got from all of it is that the GOP has captured Trump instead of the other way around.

The organizers probably planned on Trump being terminally indisposed for the convention and that it’d be all about anointing Nikki Haley – hence the heathen magic chant and the appalling waffle about some Hindoo demon creating America.

        The best thing that can be said about JD Vance is that he is the virtual opposite of that pussy fart known as Mike Pence. Trump is not going to tolerate any backstabbing going forward and Vance is a fighter, so you want someone like him on your side when the time comes to throw down. If Trump wins in November, I hope Vance will swing a baseball bat in the Senate during the interim before inauguration.

            The chance that Vance does anything of consequence as VP let alone swing a skull crushing bat is between Slim and None, and Slim is on vacation. My concern is “president” Vance, which must not occur in the muppetry. No pahjeetas allowed in this country. Vance and his wife can take their savage street craps in India, not here.

                I guess what you are saying, and I don’t mean to engage in sophistry, but it is basically impossible to do anything of consequence as VP, unless the President lets you do it, which almost never happens (Dick Cheney and… that’s about it). I tend to think that Trump may give Vance more rope especially considering the elite and power players behind him, but it’s impossible to tell until it happens.
I do think Vance is by far the frontrunner for 2028 though, no matter what happens in this election.

        Fascinating that far more men in the Dissident right are upset he married an Indian than he is lavishly devoted to our greatest ally and wants conflict with China over Taiwan.Given the sorry state of white American women, there is a lot of butt hurt in store for the Dissident right because more high status men are choosing Asians.JD Vance is probably as good as we can expect. Given that America is a conquered nation, our rulers are not going to accept an anti Israel candidate for the ticket. Vance seems to be capable of getting a clearer picture of reality and changing his positions. He at least has discussed the Great replacement and expressed sympathy with the wiring class. Just getting white people to recognize the great replacement and what it means will be a huge win even if he and Trump don’t do anything to stop it.Maybe Vance will keep evolving. Maybe he will backtrack like Trump has done. Time will tell but nothing major will be allowed to happen with the presidency if the Orange Man makes it in

            He practically begged to be co-opted with his incessant approval seeking behavior, backstabbing of his base &amp; reneging on his campaign promises. Once he orchestrated that ukraine funding deal I figured that was done deal, he wanted that second term to satisfy his ego no matter the cost.

                Every Halloween, Dimon used to open his home in the Gold Coast of Chicago to neighborhood trick-or-treaters.  Booze, small snacks, full-sized candy bars.  It was wild.
He kept the house and kept up the tradition for years after he moved to NYC.
It doesn’t make him “one of us”, but it does provide evidence that he has a soul.

        Just heard this, and I agree:
JD Vance is a shoutout to the neglected demographic that got Trump elected, the Rustbelt middle class white voter.
You could look at it this way: he was undecided until the day of the shooting…and then chose the people who stood by him in that crowd.
I mean, how many times have we seen a candidate pickedbecausehe represented the white deplorables? Not the standard and cynically obvious “he’ll win the black percentage!” play by the Rove types.

        I noticed that within that “strident right,” some of the people at Counter-Currents have become especially unhinged. And these are people who seemed, well, relatively sane compared with the out-and-proud Nazis. The former are talking as if they expected Trump to pick a reincarnation of Heinrich Himmler as running mate. Since Trump didn’t do that, he must be condemned as the greatest Cuck in history. Not that they were very appreciative of Trump anyway, but…From my observations, which seem to match pretty well ZMan’s comments, people like Vance and Musk have acquired a growing appreciation for what the threats really are. And they seem to have a more realistic view of what can and should be done. My hunch is that they will accomplish more that is positive than what some ideologue in office would accomplish.

        I read Vance’s bio in Wikipedia this morning and was unimpressed:  In the Marines, but not a fighter.  Did well college – very well.  Good for him.  Wrote a book that became a cultural touch-stone.  That’s nice.  After that he seemed to have drifted around the Swamp.  Meh.  I am not saying that he doesn’t have sound opinions, but it seems a pretty thin resume.  I mean it’s not the amphibious invasion of Europe.  But I guess it’s more than getting some asbestos removed from a Chicago housing project…

        Vance is one of the few intelligent members of the Senate.   I’ll give you that.  However when he talks about the war in Ukraine he seems to not be philosophically against the war so much as he understands the strategic situation in the West.  His point seems to be that the war is unwinnable so we should cut our losses.Now that is progress but I wish he was against the war because we started it and because it is morally wrong.   Regards Israel and their stated intent to expand,  Vance is close to full on neocon as is his new boss.I guess this is the best we can do at this time.

        Great post today. This is the most solid way of thinking I have seen presented to me in regards to Vance. I hope Vance is stumbling his way to recognizing that he can wear the crown of the man who began the project of saving Occidental Man and the entirety of his civilization across three continents. He could go down in history with his name above Martel, Alfred, Octavian if he seizes the moment. I bet he doesn’t realize it yet. If he comes to, then things could get very interesting.It does seem that the libertarian oligarchs, (who ironically make their fortunes off of the government’s printing press and by direct contracts), are going to use their power to do more than vote this time. Without mobilization and active support Trump does nothing.I think the key for them and for us is if they understand that the America’s queen is fully surrounded on the board. It is surrounded by hoards of legal and illegal immigrants. There are four years to enact deportations both physically forced and through financial incentives like those of White Papers Policy Institute. WPPI needs a seat at the table. If they do not build a real wall, by enriching the SV drone/tech guys like Palmer Luckey and that MAGA kid from Nevada who was building drones and tech specifically for border enforcement and get them to mobilize a Terminator style border defense and if they do not truly do mass deportations then America goes from in the grave to coffin closed under six feet of dirt. Biden’s platform is, “Finish The Job”, for a reason.The Republicans also need to change their optics. I never watch these conventions. What snips I have seen I have thought I was watching globalist conventions the DIE is so prominent. I hope all Whites (Americans) are on a needle size thread of just walking away. Trump and his admin better represent America (majority White/European people), or we will walk away and come back ready to throw over the table.The situation is intolerable and grows worse by the day. If you are a ConInc insider reading this, the clock is ticking. This cannot go on. And one more thing, you aren’t going to rescue the American experiment. You are going to have to break with principles and ideology to absolutely crush The Regime. They own the system and they wrote the rules that usurped the ones that you foolishly play by. That means, you are going to have to abandon your leftism and become true Right Wingers. On the other side of saving the American people, we’ll figure out . If you don’t save Our people, then you will fail. Become Right Wing or go home.One thing is for sure. Saturday’s assassination attempt guarantees that from here on out, every politician will have their own Praetorian Guard. That could turn to our favor in the coming years. The Left put this in motion, and it is not to their advantage.

            You know, theoretically we become adults at age 18. I don’t know about you, but when I was 40 I still had some stupid ideas. You really need another 20 years to learn through life experience and to get cynical enough to have your head screwed on straight. We’re not talking about running a company here, where short-term decision-making rules the day. We’re talking about making decisions that are going to have generational impact. Seasoning that comes through age and experience I think is a plus in government.

                His age also surprised me – that does seem young to be at that level of power since 40 is about the time you START getting wisdom.  And he is eligible to run only because his birthday is in August and the election is in November.The Indian wife thing bothers me, but not enough to stay home on the VP ticket.  At the top of the ticket I would have to think a long time. Similarly I like Vivek a lot and would have beers with the guy, but would never vote for him.

        I think many folks here are missin’ it.
Over the last decade, there have been two main camps regarding Trump. There are those who think he will operate the levers and gears of the machine to their liking or not to their liking and those who get that he exists to destroy the machine, even as he tries to operate it.
Vance is not /areguy, but he’s the best choice in the sense that he is most likely to break some things. That’s all that matters.

        Madame Guilfoyle strutted out in a determined, practiced manner.She invoked the armor of God and made the sign of the cross.  Then it was all botox and volume.An hour later her fi-ance entered to “Stranglehold.”JD Vance telling Mamaw Stories.Pretty direct appeal to Appalachia as a political bloc.But the robot scriptwriters have Vance talking a lot about white people fighting without ever addressing us directly.  Or getting into why we are fighting or who we are supposed to be fighting against.  Some calm but determined blood and soil stuff that could be directed towards or against anything.But mostly it was a competent recounting of his well-packaged biography.  The new brown woman will be an improvement over the current brown woman.  The doubters should close their eyes and imagine the world’s 1.2 billion Hindus trying to establish relations with the dirt people, and JD Vance is how they are going about it.Jonathan Bowden saw the need for thinking seriously about majority-minority politics years ago.So did Arthur Kemp.  But no one did because it is unpleasant and difficult to think about, especially for midwits.  And because thinking about it has been anathametized by the ususal suspects, who were well-represented tonight, both directly and through marriage.This whole production has been slick but unsubtle: from re-running the Roosevelt shooting gag to staging it in Milwaukee to trolling the Clintonistas by ending the evening with Mac’s “Don’t Stop”.

        The system cannot be saved, since the collapse of that system is the only event that would have enough political clout to create a change. Collapse is the only irrestible force capable of smashing through the establishment immovable object.

        Is there an equivalent to Clarence “Kelly” Johnson actively attempting to lead redesign and design for Western Civilization as we have appreciated it? This, my fellow UM engin Wolverine, is the standard I believe most of us have set seldom to experience. We deserve a Kelly Johnson in my heart.

        The way I see it Vance is my people. I read his book a couple years ago. It was like seeing my reflection in water.  His mother could have been my first wife.I wouldent watch her die.Thank God we had no children.I doubt the republic can be saved &amp; restored… without bloodshed.These guys are a lifeline to grasp at. Now they need to find a place for Tulsi.

        Trump should have picked DeSantis. DeSantis has solid wins against the woke agenda in Florida, and is a dot the I’s cross the T’s policy guy. DeSantis also brings million’s of his own supporters. Disgruntled former Trump supporters who abandoned Trump after his first term.Much as I’m a Trump guy, he just makes a lot of poor decisions regarding staff.

        “The dissident case for Vance.”
Another article with a clear agenda to coax dissidents to accepting what is now extremely blatant. Probably due to all the talk online not buying any of it. I’m struggling to even read here anymore.

            Well, name who you think should be running for P and VP. You have ideas of what you  don’t want, let us know what you do want. It has to be two real persons, not a shopping list of attitudes, properties, and wishes. Two real people.
This goes out to anyone dissatisfied with the choices. Let us know who you think will do the job.
