        I am ethnic Indian and I completely agree with you. ‘Real Wages’ have been dropping in the tech field for quite some time now. The whole problem is exacerbated by the importation of my fellow brown brothers-who happily undercut me, and each other, for jobs.
It’s race to the bottom!

I’m generally pro-immigration, but bringing indentured servants in to compete with you is not immigration. That’s slavery.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It’s an overstatement to say porn built the internet, but it was a joke in the 90’s because it was mostly true
No wonder Al Gore put so much time and effort into its invention.

        Facebook or Google aren’t the first In their business but they’re promoted to a virtual monopoly because their owners are “Tribesmen”.

        I’d call it slavery, except slave owners were legally liable:“The Obama administration has ordered federal agents responsible for protecting one of the nation’s busiest and most crime-infested regions near Mexico to stop apprehending drunk drivers, according to an internal government memo that also concedes an officer that elects to detain them is “acting within the course and scope of his employment.”Obtained by Judicial Watch this week, the notice is titled “Enforcement Options With Alcohol-Impaired Drivers” and directs the 4,000-plus U.S. Border Patrol agents in the Tucson, Arizona sector to “release” individuals under the influence and “allow them to go on their way.”“There is no legal requirement for a Border Patrol agent to intervene in a state crime, including DUI,” the order says, adding that “therefore there is generally no liability that will attach to the agent or agency for failing to act in this situation.”viathe market-tickerAnd speaking of, there were only 500k slaves imported to the American colonies. While you have now tens of millions of central American “pseudo slaves”.All the benefits of slavery with none of the liability, you can even pat yourself on the back by supporting it!Fun fact, if i as a white person from Europe wanted to just visit the US, I’d have to disclose my finances, provide a bank statements, give my biometric data and 24h before you board the plane, you have to tell the embassy where exactly in the US you are staying. They are very strict about it all.It’s always funny when European students are sent back to Europe in the middle of a semester, because they only had like 5k instead of the required 10k on their bank account, while illegal aliens in the very same class, which don’t even have a valid id, are left alone…Another fun fact is also how illegals are also theinfection vector for measles, it gets better and better!

Way back in the olden thymes, it was the porn makers who were pushing the envelope on web technology. It’s an overstatement to say porn built the internet, but it was a joke in the 90’s because it was mostly true. Porn also figured out how to monetize the web first with subscription models for their product.

        How cool would it be for a main stream news outlet to do a report on this, complete with interviews of the “imported ones” in their camps, telling the story of the wages they’re paid and the hours they work. Juxtaposed with interviews of the hapless college graduates who spent so much to get the tech degree they were told was the key to wealth and success in the 21st century, and can’t find a full-time job.Sunlight, the best disinfectant, blocked by the clouds of collusion. Hmm, Clouds Of Collusion. Cool band name.

        People say that more immigration is an affront to government, but the weird thing is, more immigration doesn’t preclude enforcement of non-immigration laws. Police presence is as strong as ever and the jails are full of people, so it’s not like we have anything close to anarchy despite lots of immigration.
