        Decades ago over on The Daily Reckoning, some long-gone author (Bill Bonner or one of his collaborators perhaps) had a rule-of-thumb that was basically: People (the public) will believe in anything, when the time has come for them to believe it. I‚Äôm sure this could be stated in many similar ways. Any number of examples can be found. Here are just a couple of examples.Old: A gold coin standard is mandatory; without it, no check on the unlimited issuance of money exists and the value of same will drop to zero.New: The gold standard is too constricting. We must give the banks/government more power to create credit. Therefore we‚Äôll make these changes to the gold standard‚Ä¶Old: Men are men. Women are women. Sex roles are immutably decreed by biology. Society and culture reinforce these roles with the goal of the greatest benefit to the society.New: That‚Äôs all so twentieth-century. Down with the partriarchy and white supremacy. Don‚Äôt like your gender? No problem! Change it at will. If makeup and clothing isn‚Äôt enough, you can get surgery and hormones to ramp it up. Do others resist your new-found identity? No problem; now you‚Äôre a victim, and the law will come to your aid in supporting your rebellion against reality.

        For Christians, the key to the next life lies in this one. Even the pagans had a dim awareness that what was sown in this life bore fruit in the next.

            Yes, it is a false dichotomy. Of course, the Christian wants to be saved but his main focus is on this life: how to live, pray, follow the Master, how to react after situations. After all, the Bible has about 1200 pages and no clear description of Heaven.When my university scheduled a meeting to talk about the new LGBT program, I was full of anxiety. How should I act as a Christian? I never thought of Heaven: after all, my salvation does not depend on that. I decided to express my opinion against this program. I knew I was risking my job. In fact, I was fired, in my 50s, after 10 years of work. But the afterlife never had anything to do with that.Religion and ideology is also a false dichotomy. Classical Islam, Old Testament religion and Rabbinical Judaism include rules for politics, inheritance, judges, etc. Confucianism does not include the supernatural. There is no definition of religion that can include all traditional beliefs and exclude liberalism. As ‚ÄúThe Myth of Religious Violence‚Äù book says, labelling Christianity as religion and liberalism as non-religion is only a political trick to exclude Christianity from public life

                Thank you for saving me the necessity of replying to this post; your reply succinctly does it.  I would add only that Christianity was brought to Japan by Francis Xavier in 16th Century, but was declared illegal and persecuted to near extinction under the Shogunate.  So instead of a country of Jesus followers we eventually got World War II in the Pacific.

                    Yes, it‚Äôs somewhat misleading to say that Christianity failed in Japan. While it certainly failed to totally dominate the Japanese socioreligious landscape for various reasons, there is also a long-established Christian community in Japan with an impressive history of resilience in the face of persecution.

                    In fact, one could argue that Christianity was deliberately exterminated in Japan because it was far TOO successful, and the newly-created Shogunate could not brook any kind of challenge to its authority after unifying the country. Japan had several daimyos who had converted to Christianity (particularly in the south) and thousands upon thousands of commoners who openly practiced the faith.
The Shogunate basically did the same thing to Buddhism, though less violently: by the time the Meiji Restoration came around, every Buddhist temple in the country was little more than an administrative center for the civil authority.

                I recall reading it around 1980 probably because Dad‚Äôs ‚Äúnewsletters‚Äù mentioned it. Probably borrowed it from a public library !!! Perhaps that can be ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù since this was in a rural county of Virginia where the last vestiges of the Confederacy hadn‚Äôt yet been purged. Library probably had shelves of Mein Kampf available too. üòÄ
The title appears to available from ‚Äúallternative‚Äù sources. I cannot speak for whether it‚Äôs the genuine article.

        What is interesting is the evolving morality around p3d0s and the like. The film by the star of Person of Interest about rescuing kids from that stuff generated a ton of hate in the media, with the remarkable assertions that it was morally wrong to be against these p3d0s as that was anti-Alphabet+ people.Again, sacred Alphabet+ people have a right (to White) kids for whatever purpose, because their sacred gayness allows this. Its pretty remarkable. And its a clash of the fury/hatred of ordinary White people by the elite and their gofers, against the fundamental genetic interests of said ordinary White people ‚Äî to have grandkids, to exist somehow in the future. Of course, open borders = p3d0.OT, what‚Äôs the over/under for Newsom‚Äôs arrest? Now that there is a serious effort to unseat Dr. Jill? Stupid Party Members, thinking that would just stop at Orange Man Bad. [Yes we will all be targets, every last one of us, either in a virtual gulag see Nigel Farage denied banking services etc. or a hard version, but they will be first.] Stalin went after Trotsky before he turned back to the Kulaks. [No way the neo-cons, DOJ, Feebs etc want adult supervision now, so they will back Dr. Jill to the hilt.]I think two months, tops before Newsom is arrested for his and his wife‚Äôs foundation pushing Alphabet+ people in schools, and raking off $$$.

                Agreed, but there‚Äôs already been stories about financial improprieties. Non reporting of expenses to the Newsoms etc. Siebel Newsom ‚Äúproduced‚Äù a documentary sold at pricey $$ to schools, the proceeds going to the Foundation that has as its chief officers the Newsoms. Who operate a winery.
I assume this was the shot across the bow. Dr. Jill is not going to leave the White House.

        Web: ‚ÄúNo one dare say that international finance would be backing up a war to destroy Monarchies, thus creating a need to replace them with democracy,which we all know is influenced by Dollars, instead of heritage and culture.‚Äù‚ÄúWW1 was waged for two reason and two reasons only: 1) to destroy the monarchies of Europe; and 2) destroy the Ottoman Empire so that Palestine would become under the protectorate of the British empire,which was then handed over to the Rothschilds via the Balfour Declaration (the deal struck to bring the US into the war).‚ÄùSo how did the creators of universalist monotheism hack the folk nationalists?  The same way they did before, in the beginning.Universalist religion begins as politics; the subject are made to submit to the conquerors.  This can be by threats, real or imagined; or by promises, real (such as patronage or status), or imagined, marketing to desires.(Said desires are especially powerful, tapping into an undefined perception, a sixth sense, that there is a something more than the merely physical.)Universalist monotheism is a conquest religion, using tactics of a weaker minority, the ‚Äúcoalition of‚Äù aspect.Folk religion is the deep well of accrued knowledge; shared knowledge, genetics, and territory creating a rooted identity.The universalist monotheism of Democracy- we must all submit to the same master- is fulfilling its driven  vision of supplanting the organic identities of patria, natio, familia.  The weak are conquering the strong.This was done in the White West as it was done in the Bronze Age: by the messaging, the narrative, of a guilt/shame culture.Through ethno-masochism.You‚Äôre not as good as them, no.You‚Äôre as bad.We are all equal,because we‚Äôre all equally sinful.Therefore, you are no better than those who wish to live beside you, and share equally in all you have.Minorities, women, immigrants, foreigners, tweaks, whoever, because we‚Äôre all one family, the human family, all children of the same master.One master!  And since the master must be the highest, why, he must also be the first!  And to be the first, he must be all-powerful!All must submit to this father, and achieve Krishna consciousness.Since you haven‚Äôt achieved Krishna consciousness, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.Because you‚Äôre doing it wrong,And because the master is perfect, and above you-You must be getting it wrong on purpose!  Or because you can‚Äôt!You have fallen short.Either way, it proves that you are not fit to rule yourself, and therefore must submit to the master.To your brothers and sisters-To Democracy.And since you‚Äôre the problem, you obstinate throwback‚Ä¶And since by our reasoning, there can only be One, the ideal, the most Perfect‚Ä¶You must respect mine, as I am allied with the elect, but I don‚Äôt have to respect yours, low creature.Therefore, it is right to push you out of what you claim to have built; your kind deserve only to form a ring-fence to protect and serve the more deserving elect.The natural morality the order, of primate hierarchy is thus inverted, turned on its head.The weak, unable to actually rule as a majority- their sole vision is to upset the cart, that they might catch the cart- the weak, now uncertain of a disordered future, seek strength of numbers, turning only to their own.Soon enough, they will turn on their own- because that wasn‚Äôt real Democracy, real universal Democracy has never been tried.

        Commandments against idolatry are overlooked as low key, but it might be what humans do the most unwittingly.
Celebrity worship is idolatry.  Superhero collections are idolatry.  These atheist geeks have shelves of graven image statues of superman and star wars that would put a pagan shrine to shame.
Worship of technology and social media and selfies is an obvious one.
Of course people make idols over their bodies, obsessing how they look.  Or make idols of others bodies into paraphilias.
All people will worship, whether they know it or not

            Coming back because I forgot to thank Fakeemail for illustrating my contention that of the Bible is political, political messaging.Political messaging is fine, good, when applied to the proper scale of ‚Äúmember of a family, community, tribe‚Äù; the difficulty is sorting out what works for sheik and shtetl from messages handed down from a ruling class.Messaging, how? Through memes.The didn‚Äôt have cartoons, so they painted a picture with stories.  A picture with a point, like Aesop did.(Islamic storytelling never gets to a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù.  There is no If-Then-Thus; only and endless run-on of a thousand and one nights.  Semitic programming is for a different brain than Aryan programming. Feminine brains follow rules, they don‚Äôt solve problems.)We were in a meme war then, just as we are now.  It‚Äôs the only way to move one‚Äôs Herd.

        Man plants seed in a moist fertile place; after a time, life emerges.  A European looks across an Alpine valley, lake or sea shore, gazes upon mother and child, do these not stir the soul?We have a sense of time, we want to perpetuate these wonderful vistas and physicalities forward into futures as far as they can be perpetuated.  We want to drink good water, eat and enjoy healthy food.  We want unspoiled lands.  We want to go on in to the future, just as long gone ancestors went on into us.Reverence for nature and perceiving one‚Äôs self as a continuing part is not the problem.  The desires to take care and husband resources is a good thing.The problem is the Jew.  This entity was created by a scribal guild.  The Jew must live apart because the Jew has a mission from god.  He can‚Äôt just become us because yakov is our spiritual better. He must be our shepherd. He must be hated to maintain separateness. yakov must rule humanity.We have a situation: a nutty group of outsiders control our media.  The have perverted our desire to live in good harmony with nature into something twisted and evil.  It is yakov‚Äôs means of warfare to twist and pervert.There are those who should know better that will draw our attention to the rattle.  The problem is the fangs.

        I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and documentary watching about ancient civilizations as of late. A common thread of any ancient civilization documentary or essay since the 1990s is to incorporate climate change as having a huge impact on history. A recent documentary that I watched about Egyptian pyramids emphasized that one pyramid in particular was once surrounded by water, and was made to look like an island floating in the middle of a lake. The area where they pyramid is located has since become more dry, but of course that environmental condition has been true for at least a millennium.Many once thriving ancient cities are covered in water. Underwater archaeology has grown in the last 3-4 decades, and a lot of research has uncovered some fascinating things. But the flooding of these cities occurred thousands of years ago, NOT after the invention of internal combustion engines.Every finger-wagging documentary or essay that uses ancient history as a warning about climate change is doing a self-own, because it highlights how abundantly clear it is that Earth‚Äôs climate has been steadily warming for 10,000 years. Pre-historic science also shows that there have been periods in Earth‚Äôs history that were much hotter than they are now. In fact, a global climate that is 2-3 degrees warmer would greatly benefit the world as far as agriculture goes. They never mention this.I‚Äôm not even totally against having this discussion about climate change. They‚Äôre aren‚Äôt wrong in pointing out climate change as a serious thing that will have consequences in the future. The problem is that their climate change lecturing is on par with their ‚Äúdiversity is our greatest strength‚Äù lecturing. Their fantasies don‚Äôt align with reality in either case.

        This is not hard. The collection of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù beliefs can be explained in three words: single, childless women. The CDS‚Äôs latest study on fertility (January, 2023) reveals that 48% of women of childbearing age (15-44) in the US are childless. I saw another recent study that predicted over 50% of women in the US will be single and childless by 2030.These ‚Äúwoke‚Äù movements are populated overwhelmingly by single, childless women. Typically, they are credentialed and with decent jobs in HR departments or government, but dumber than a bag of rocks. Having failed to exercise their biological imperative to become a mother, they compensate by attempting to roleplay mom over an entire swath of society. Worshiping Gaia makes some psychological and spiritual sense when you have nothing else for which to live and no legacy to leave.Fix the single, childless woman problem and most of the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù issues melt away.

                The tribe could not have sold their destructive narratives so effortlessly if it wasn‚Äôt for white women especially the childless university graduate ones.
Two big red pills for me were seeing how if only men had voted, Trump would have won every state. If only women had voted, Hillary would have won nearly every state.
The second was the demographics of the wall support. Single white women were the most opposed to the wall with around 90 percent opposing it.
The tribe comes up with the narratives. Women are the enforcers and vanguard.

            ‚ÄúMost will just lament the most recent development but remain blind to what caused it as with the feminists who resist the transgender movement which is just a natural progression of their own ideology. They will be unable to see they have brought this about themselves. The leftists, the globalists, the feminists, the internationalists (no borders!), the materialists, the atheists and a whole host of other spiritual deviants will wring their hands and say this is not what we meant when it is the direct result of their thoughts and writings and words and actions.‚Äù‚ÄìWilliam Wildbloodhttp://meetingthemasters.blogspot.com/2023/07/feminist-hypocrisy.html‚ÄúAnd Yet, the complaints from feminists about women being discriminated-against, held-back (glass ceiling etc) are more strident than ever; and the bureaucratic/ legal apparatus to favour women increases and increases without end-point.This demonstrates that the Real motivations behind this movement are totally different from the advertised motives ‚Äì and probably always has-been, considering how rare it is for feminists to see-through the false affectations.To me this demonstrates the corrosive and corrupting power of the sin of resentment; how it feeds upon itself insatiably ‚Äì and gradually mutates into sheer spite.‚Äù‚ÄìBruce Charlton

                Ah, yes, behold the power ofressentimentin the Nietzschean sense, a power almost tectonic in its ability to grind great, God-given things to nothingness. And to those in the grip of this demonic possession, the very ability to comprehend the beauty of that which they are led to destroy is extirpated first of all, leading inevitably to their insensibility toward the evils that they then perpetrate.

            Excellent observation. The theory was that, with child bearing now a distant option, women could become what they are supposed to be and live a rich, full life destroying the patriarchy. In practice, it has led to vast herds of desperately embittered woke females with too much time on their hands.

        I really hate it when people who are basically atheists possessing only the most superficial and curated understanding of religion, then presume to sit in judgment over it, pronouncing on what it is and was, and who believes what and why. They imagine their position at the cusp of a failing modern age gives them a bird‚Äôs eye view of the subject, when they are really just ignorantly scoffing at sounds they‚Äôve lost the ability to hear.The only question that should be put about a religion is whether it‚Äôs true or not. Any material or even ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù benefits accruing to the believer are simply not part of the subject. It is the hallmark of a modern man that he prescinds from the question of religious truth thesocial effects of religious beliefimmediately and subtly, without even noticing that a change has taken place. This is because modernity recognizes only social effects; everything is real only to the extent that it makes some sort of social impact, and the solipsistic study of such impacts is modernity‚Äôs only purpose, only science, and only art. The whole history of the world has been transvaluated into a sum of ‚Äúmovements‚Äù operating according to the logic of Facebook groups. This is no way to understand anything.Wokeness today is certainly not a religion or an ideology. Modern man has no organ for real religious belief and the age of ideology lies behind him. Wokeness is an avoidance mechanism, a way of palliating a situation has grown quite intolerable but which no one thinks he has the ability to change.Although it cuts against the grain of contemporary teaching, human life does not usually require ‚Äúmeaning,‚Äù in the grand sense, in order to be lived contentedly. Most people neither have nor desire meaning, so hypothesizing a quest for meaning behind a burgeoning social trend will usually fail to capture the essence of it. What people cannot do without, however, is amodus vivendi. Since modern society affords no way of redressing the many grievances caused by living in an open-air flea market managed by oligarchs, wokeness was developed as a set of rules designed to keep grievances from breaking out into open conflict.Hitherto, those who would attempt explain the progression of wokeness have erred by looking only at theenforcersof wokeness‚Äîthe government, the corporations, the universities, the media, various race-hustlers, and so forth. Among these, it is easy to see how self-interested desires for money, power, and status play a part. Social-climbers, sadists, self-seekers, and any grifter determined to get his piece of the pie, will force their way to the forefront of this movement just as they would with any other movement. But the motivations of these types, which are found universally in every going concern, do not say anything about what wokenessitselfis; and analyzing only their motivations, to the exclusion of the motivations of the rest of us, who simply suffer under it and grumble, is bound to give a very skewed picture.We suffer and grumble under wokeness because we have to, because it has become amodus vivendiand the effort to change it is not really worth the cost. It exists because it is a direct derivative of quotidian politeness, ‚Äúthe ethics of the marketplace,‚Äù the prescriptive norms from the oligarchs designed to keep the plebs subordinated. To this end, it makes no difference whether anyone really believes it or not (and most don‚Äôt). It‚Äôs just the way we have to live.In order to stop this, we have to cease living in an oligarchic-controlled collective. We will have to fight many hard battles on many levels in order to claw back a respectable measure of economic independence, property rights, and local autonomy for small communities. There is no shortcut or secret to this, but it has to bedone. It is a very arduous climb that requires us to actually partake in the dreaded political process, and that‚Äôs why you see so few people interested in it.

            It is a beautiful analysis and timeless to boot.
Seventy years ago, in a Soviet-satellite country, wokeness (in arts) was called socialistic realism.  I remember everybody in my school complaining that the assigned books were unreadable because they were untrue.I think we understood that the regime would not mind if their writers were more talented or we were more receptive. Why don‚Äôt they drop the absurd plots and stop annoying us?
I don‚Äôt think we understood that the silly medium contained a clearheaded message: this is your life now, forever.

                I still grapple with the deceptive (in my opinion) use of the term ‚Äúreal.‚Äù Unless I‚Äôm mistaken, the term dates to Plato and his Forms. What I‚Äôd call the abstract, interior world of ideals is what Platonism, in fact, terms the ‚Äúreal.‚Äù In contrast was that ‚Äúrabble of the senses,‚Äù the body‚Äôs sense organs that tried to inform the brain of the ‚Äúapparent‚Äù world.I‚Äôm not sure if the above is an example of what Neitzsche (and perhaps others) call inversion of values. But it certainly would qualify, seems to me. Let‚Äôs see: make up any old shit you want, in your imagination, and declare it to be the true reality. Call it the ‚Äúreal.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt deny that abstraction (‚ÄúReal‚Äù) and the empirical (‚ÄúApparent‚Äù) worlds serve useful ends (e.g. morals, ethics, law, even mathematics!) But when what I call idealism (Plato‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù) takes up arms against Objective Reality (his ‚Äúapparent‚Äù), my money is on the latter.

                    Late comment.I call it Plato‚Äôs Mistake; it is the same mistake the religious make.Plato assumed that there was a perfect form from which the earthly descended.No.  The opposite is true.We can sense that there is a World Beyond the physical- BUT, the reality is, itdescends from us.From the real Real, the reality of organic physical form.This is the best Creation can do.The Mistake comes from imagining One Beginning; no, the physical constants were built up, piece-by-piece, particle-by-particle, through unknown cycles of Creation.That is what I call the Bones.  The organic nodes- biospheres like ours- build another layer on the Bones.When energy loses its push, and gravity resumes its pull, snowballing once again into a core, the structure we add by generating radiant panspermia- information, or coherent form- is what the titanic pressures of that core will compress against.Information is incompressible.We provide the the compression spark in the Big Diesel.And Bang!, it all begins again.Without Life, the essential froth, all the lights in the sky stop.This is the Why of existence.And we, being the embodied memory of those very same physical constants- their living expression- we will mold the next cycle of Creation, embedded in its weave.The five forces, the Hand, of Creation, is the Power above the gods.God‚Äôs Creator.

        ‚ÄúPerhaps the appeal of what we call wokeness lies in the sense of identity it provides to people who live in highly conformist societies.‚Äù
This exactly.
Modern society has stripped people of any identity, killed God and made even the affluent pretty miserable. They need a reason to suffer. Jesus and Buddha have been ignored. So creating heaven on earth is there goal. They think Woke is the path.
I think it‚Äôs easier to multiply loaves and fishes than it is to civilize Barbarians, but that‚Äôs what make a horse race.

This is why it‚Äôs dumb to say we should just get rid of gender studies and things will be better. If it was just gender studies it might be a manageable problem. This is someone who ‚Äúmajored in something useful‚Äù.
I had always assumed that blacks in this level of society are like Sidney Poitier. But it seems you have professional class blacks that are almost as bad as ghetto blacks, just bad in a different way.

            Look, this woman is most likely an AA graduate from med school.  Why would one think that she has an superior intellect to match her (given) status. Her post seems to reinforce my bias.She is mentally still a ghetto Black without her own accomplishments‚Äîand she probably senses it‚Äîhence she display‚Äôs an MD behind her name in a non-medical forum/discussion.  I‚Äôve seen bunches of these people, both White and minority!  Hell, when I was a graduate student, the ribbing one got when claiming the title ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù upon graduating was humbling to see and strongly reinforced by the faculty of my department‚Äîwho decried such ‚Äúairs‚Äù were for the  Med School folk, whom they considered no better than technicians.  That is to say, they were not real scientists and so insecure they needed to call each other *doctor* in front of patients.Majoring in something useful is fine as long as you accomplish something like graduating on your *own* merit‚Äînot because of your race.  I suspect that‚Äôs as important as whether or not she took Feminist Studies courses.  Hell I did as well as an undergrad, but that‚Äôs another story.

                Tony Scalia could be a jerk at times but in one of the last oral arguments he participated in, he said this:‚ÄúOne of ¬≠¬≠‚Äî one of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don‚Äôt come from schools like the University of Texas.

        Some kind of perceived social status has to be the answer because there is no material gain from the religion, in fact the opposite. Although many of them already have plenty of money for at least a generation.It‚Äôs weird how it spread so quickly too. Even 15 years ago most of the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people today were just race blind liberals. Why did it spread so fast? What changed that made simply being a regular liberal not nearly enough for them?Why didn‚Äôt this happen earlier, when the lower and middle classes had a lifestyle more similar to the wealthy? You‚Äôd think that would make them feel more of a need to signal their separateness than today.Are today‚Äôs ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people our natural rulers, and former aristocrats, that have gone crazy in the modern age? The ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people are not stupid, in fact most are highly organized and competent. If they are former aristocrats, is it a fear response as they are getting flooded with the 3rd worlders they used to rule? Quite a lot of revenge narrative for example in the France riot.Are whites splitting off into 2 ethnic groups? Can we even consider a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù white person and a Dirt white person to be of the same race? The Clouds don‚Äôt think so.What motivates the woke males? Why are skinny armed soy face white men working in tech (for example) happy to be cucks admonishing their privilege all day long? They seem happy with no sex.All open ended questions. Hard for me to say because their mindset is so alien to me. We don‚Äôt understand our enemies which is a problem.

            Humans seem to have an instinct to form ingroups and outgroups in any situation, even when the humans are similar.  In the past, in otherwise homogeneous societies, whites fought over religion and class.I guess that part of the hatred that white leftists have for other whites is a new expression of the old class conflict.One of the many reasons that I am so interested in the failed Austrian painter is that he had explicit policies to try to encourage brotherhood between the different classes.How much can the seemingly innate instinct to form ingroups and outgroups within a homogeneous group be mitigated?

            You could say that the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù industrialists making millions off government subsidies for inefficient power sources are the corollary to televangelists. There is some money in it, even if it‚Äôs not exactly prosperity gospel.I think you understate their need to signal their separateness from the dirts. They need to signal it every day in every way. Material affluence, the display of which is discouraged so as to not offend Gaia, isn‚Äôt a reliable marker, or always an obvious one. Out and about in their daily world, nobody really knows how affluent the average person they cross paths with is.

            My guess as to why they went nuts in the last 15 years is Obama. In 2008 they put all of their hopes and dreams in him, thinking he was going to bring about paradise. Around 2013, they figured out paradise wasn‚Äôt going to happen. Rather than do some self-reflection, they thought some evil people must have prevented their sacred Obama from doing it. Who opposed him? Racist whites.

        These soulless gods aren‚Äôt as omnipotent as they believe themselves to be.The guy who runs Boderhawk shared an experience he had in a small college town in Switzerland a few years ago. He heard noises in the street below late one night and looked out the window of his apartment. He saw two vibrant, scholarly refugees brawling. One of them threw the other through a glass store window. The local police arrived and sent the less injured guy back up to his apartment. There was glass and blood on the street in front of the store.The next morning, he decided to go check out the scene in the light of day. There was nothing to see. They had cleaned the glass and blood and repaired the store window within a few hours. Appalling.A quick google search of ‚ÄúFrance‚Äù today provides dozens of ‚Äòtour de France‚Äô stories. The few articles which might mention the destruction and looting appear are articles about systemic race-ism as they laud the latest patron saint, France‚Äôs Georges Floyd.Try as they might, they can‚Äôt completely conceal the mostly peaceful protests there. They can‚Äôt sweep in and rebuild the largest public library in Marseille and the all the other buildings which have been destroyed the past few weeks.

            Melissa:  Harkens back to the classic ‚ÄúIf a tree falls in a forest . . . ‚ÄùMy husband‚Äôs colleague, who took his family to Europe for a train trip, insisted there was no unrest in France that HE saw, therefore it did not exist.

        Hrrrrmmmmm. I am a recent convert to Christianity and can‚Äôt speak with any authority but‚Ä¶I think I might take exception to your statement that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about getting into the afterlife‚Ä¶‚Äù In my outhouse studies, the Bible is actually very vague about details of the afterlife. Also, you can‚Äôt up your chances merely by being charitable and virtue signalling. You are literally called upon to be a better human being. It is very much more about the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù and how people need to think in order to get along. But whadda I know?I can speak with some authority on the new religions. I was born and raised in The Hive where all the new gods are honoured and revered. I was banished 10 years ago when I ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù some things, and began asking all the wrong questions‚Ä¶which leads to the wrong opinions and ultimately to crime-speak.The new ideologies ‚Äì feminism, egalitarianism, Marxism, faggotry, nigolatry, (hork, spit) judeochristianity ‚Äì are all hate based. The new demons are bums like us. Heretics, apostates, dissidents or even the odd griller or normie who accidentally states the obvious out loud. If we are removed‚Ä¶ new villains will need to be created. These ideologies of hatred invariably tear themselves apart. Holiness spirals and all that. Plus, the new gods will have to wage war on each other. You‚Äôd have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at chaos that the trannies are unleashing on the queers. (Don‚Äôt be a TERF, you hateful dissident cretins!!!üòÇ).Christianity thrived and survived to this day because it starts with ‚Äúlove thy neighbour‚Ä¶‚Äù. Classical Christianity is all about assimilating your enemies and working harmoniously with them. That‚Äôs my theory‚Ä¶but I am not happy as it has holes in it.As usual, the jews perplex me. They too have thrived and survived and I am at a complete loss in understanding it. They‚Äôre hated and loathed wherever they go, they‚Äôve evoked such hatred that their communities have been murdered en masse, right down to the last woman and child‚Ä¶ and they are the biggest stinkers driving globalism and the new gods today. Isreal is powerful enough to control the Middle East. Washington is infested with pervert and corrupt jews. They have a stranglehold on our media and history. How in hell do they do it?Clearly, this topic needs much more careful thought.

            You are correct on the minimal points about the afterlife in the Bible. Heck, even Hell is three different words, none of which signal afterlife (e.g. Gehenna). However, if we understand Christianity as the Catholic Church or other main denominations, then we have to acknowledge that they do spend a great deal of time perverting the messages in the Bible, one of which is the afterlife.

                Speaking strictly clinically and dispassionately about the net result ‚Äì yes. Many Dissidents struggle with faith and spiritualism and I am merely trying to speak to them on their terms.
I struggle with my own faith too, sometimes. Years of hive mind conditioning makes it incredibly difficult sometimes.

                    On second thought I may have managed to trip over my own dink and and gone tumbling down the stairs with this. Obviously real Christianity is far more involved than ‚Äúworrying about the afterlife‚Äù and I gently chided our esteemed blog host for it.
Then I made the same mistake myself. Christianity is far more complicated and involved than ‚Äúassimilation of your enemies‚Äù.
We have to be extremely careful when we ‚Äòsimplify things‚Äô. It‚Äôs currently a huge problem in Dissident thought, but they are not the only ones doing it.

            Filthie: I recommend Yuri Slezkine‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Jewish Century.‚Äù (I was tipped off to it here or a similar place.) Of course it‚Äôs written from a European Jew perspective, but I found it quite credible. In particular, it‚Äôll provide very detailed answers to several questions you pose above. How much is true and how much is skillful storytelling, you must decide for yourself. While the book doesn‚Äôt deal much in Bronze Age legends, consider some of the Jew‚Äôs own folklore. Stripped of its supernatural trappings, there still remains more than a grain of truth in such grand narratives as Joseph‚Äôs successful career in Egypt. For whatever reasons, these people seem to have the knack for coming in as outsiders, making themselves highly useful for a time until they gain too much influence, then bringing the whole structure crashing down upon their heads (literally, as in the case of Samson‚Äôs story.)

            I always thought it ironic: Nagasaki, target #2, always had a (small) Christian community ‚Äì rare in Japan.
But really: Christianity in Japan was aggressively trampled down by Toyotomi Hideyoshi et.al., in the16th century.
(The Catholic Church seemed either incapable or unwilling to do syncretism with folk religions in either Japan or China ‚Äì see Matteo Ricci ‚Äì as they had centuries earlier done with Norse, Celtic, Latin, and Slavic folk religions.)
Anyway, check out Martin Scorsese‚Äôs SILENCE (2016?)

        Believe it not, the sexual mutilation of children for some religious end hasantecedents in Christianity. Google the ‚ÄúSkoptsy‚Äù (just don‚Äôt use Google Images.) They believed that lust was so devilish that the only way to rid the world of it was to rid the sites of the body of these vestiges‚Äîmastectomies for females and castration for males (sound familiar?) They even claimed to be in the Word with their acts:‚ÄúAnd if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:29 KJVThe most popular book among the cult members now is ‚ÄúElliot‚Äù Page‚Äôs memoir of  her sex change, ‚ÄúPageboy.‚Äù  She was a cute (albeit far from stunning) young lady, so it‚Äôs disturbing to see this, especially the photos where she‚Äôs shirtless and showing off her mutilated breasts, as if they were pecs. The book isn‚Äôt just available at specialty bookstores or libraries or online. It‚Äôs as ubiquitous as James Patterson‚Äôs crap books; it‚Äôs on sale on the racks at my grocery store, which means everyone is seeing it.There must be some American version of the ‚ÄúSkoptsy‚Äù that either antedates them or came after them. I know that Boston Corbett‚Äîthe man who killed John Wilkes Booth‚Äîwas a Union veteran and Episcopalian who removed his own testicle with scissors and thought slavery was a sin. He‚Äôd fit right in with the mainliners these days.

        The Covidian religion was a little more different than the Earth worshipers.  It offered more redemptive capacity.  With the eco religion even when you adhere to the strict theology humanity is still considered a cancer that needs to be eviscerated to make Mother Earth clean again.  In the Covidian one as long as you wore the mask, even alone in your car, boosted every five minutes, cleaned your UPS packages (I know people who did this, sadly) turned around three times to spray Lysol in house, etc., you were redeemed from the virus.  Even if you died from it you were redeemed because you somehow tried, unlike the dirty hillbilly with late stage COPD, sitting in the double wide.  And the magic RNA juice was the lambs blood.  They were pumping lambs blood inside of you, no need to paint it on a door frame.

            ‚ÄúThis new religion, as Z terms it, is coterminous with Leftism. It is Leftism. And, inasmuch as Leftism has always been the ideology of those unhappy with the status quo, it has needs be destructive.‚ÄùThe problem, though, is that these people are NOT unhappy with the status quo the way that traditional working-class/peasant leftists were. To the contrary, adherents of the new religion are the overclass ‚Äî they have a lot of money, education, status, power, nice homes, secure jobs, sexual license,  etc.Let me tell you I was in both Chapel Hill, NC and West Virginia last week, and the West Virginians are the ones who should be unhappy with the status quo. But they are the most patriotic, flag-waving, Trump-voting people out there. Meanwhile, the queers and the liberals living quite well in their shitlib bubbles are the ones consumed with hate.I think the reason the New Religion is so dissatisfied with the status quo is that they cannot stand the fact that there is anyone alive who might contradict or disagree with their bullshit. Like the Jews, they think they are the Chosen People by virtue of their social status and academic credentials. Like the Jews, they think they are entitled to live off the labor of others. Like the Jews, if they cannot have total control their Promised Land and completely exterminate every last one the Amalekites and the Canaanites, they are unhappy. They are essentially secularized Pharisees who cannot possibly allow their moral virtue to be challenged ‚Äî or to allow anyone to expose their money-grifting schemes.Not for nothing did wokism emerge as the new civic religion during the apex of Jewish power in America and the world.

                Beginning with the French Revolution, Leftists have been unhappy with society for any number of reasons. But in the present, their primary gravamen is that groups of people are not equal, dammit, and they should be!The fact that negroes, despite intensive and expensive remediation for 60-plus years, still lag far behind whites by virtually every index, drives them mad. The fact that perverts are held in lower esteem by society and are far more prone to suicide than normal people, pushes their buttons. The fact that we still live by hierarchical dyads such as criminal/lawful, insane/sane, lazy/productive, offends against their egalitarian pretensions and pieties. And, of course, the only way to level the various groups is to level civilization. In a state of nature‚Äìor so they suppose‚Äìwe are all the same.

                    Skillful use of ‚Äúlevel‚Äù as a verb in two senses. But wait, there‚Äôs more!
(1) make something (in social sense people‚Äôs opportunities or outcomes) to be equal or similar;(2) to aim (a weapon);(3) [similar] to direct a criticism or accusation;(4) [most ominously] to demolish [a building, a town, a city, etc.]
The World-Improver (Egalitarian, Liberal, Reformer, etc.) has made ample use of all four senses of that verb, dating to the dawn of civilization and perhaps even earlier.

        Not expert on this, but iirc Marx was influenced by Hegel. Hegel was an idealist, more or less gave us the modern notion of dialectic. Again iirc.Maybe I absorbed this somewhere, but to my mind, there‚Äôs a trinity of ideal, material, spiritual. Take away spirit, because it‚Äôs mysterious and more or less operates ex nihilo, and you get a dialectic. Progress is no longer a will, but a process working itself out. It‚Äôs not potentially capricious, it has fixed, potentially universal, rules. The question is, is it ideas or stuff in the driver‚Äôs seat? Again, Hegel an idealist, but Marx then a materialist‚Äî kind of interesting, not sure how significant that is, at any rate.I‚Äôm tempted to say ideology is what you get when you strip religion of the spiritual. That‚Äôs why it often takes on religious overtones and why it eventually peters out or goes insane‚Äî it‚Äôs missing a crucial piece of the puzzle.I think modernity comes down to spiritual or religious bankruptcy. People are searching for an answer when it‚Äôs been right there the whole time.FWIW: I don‚Äôt advocate everybody run to church, because the church is an institution with its own problems. Maybe you come to it, maybe you don‚Äôt. Again fwiw, I started by getting out of my head and dealing with the flesh. That raised more questions and made me realize there must be something else, which brought me to the trinity from the bottom up, which brought me back to faith. Mystery, not as superstition, but as an aspect of reality. (Which is why it‚Äôs hard to talk about without sounding superstitious or getting profoundly metaphorical.)Who knows, I might become a church-going man again lol.

        What is it about this doomsday cult that the believers find appealing? ‚Äì  Answer- The human need for suffering and depravation in order to bring enlightenment.  A middle or upper class that has always had the conveniences of modern living, hot water, electricity, etc., still needs to overcome sin.  Since all the old sins, like getting railed in an orgy or taking drugs are out the window, new sins must be invented.  There‚Äôs not even need for redemption, although buying carbon offset credits can do that.

        When humans acquired complex language skill, this enabled verbal programming of their young with ancient wisdom that served to enhance survival, hence evolutionary reinforcement. Religion was an adaptation that successfully enhanced this programming via consistency, repetition, and constructive feedback. All historical religions are a compilation of ancient and local wisdom that evolved in a particular environment.Universalist religions are those which distilled the common denominators of ancient wisdom across many environments into one composite paradigm. In addition, they all include an element of deferred gratification, which evolution seems to find valuable.The important point is that religions can only persist if they ‚Äúwork‚Äù in the sense of enhancing the ability to survive and thrive in the locality of the population base. But what happens when people are mobile across large distances and constantly change localities? What happens when ancient wisdom is no longer applicable in the new environment?The answer is that conflict replaces cooperation. And all Hell breaks loose.

                Yes, the inmates are now running the asylum and they command the obedience of the Jackboots to ensure their security. And all tyrannies are like this because its the only way they can persist, even if temporarily. At the root, these societies largely sustain themselves via exploitation or slavery, which is enabled by application of supreme force. If evolution looked favorably upon this model, slavery would still exist. Eventually the plebs reach a breaking point and rise up. We are not quite there yet, but with the defeat of Ukraine and the rise of BRICS+, that tipping point may come sooner than many think.

        One of the strangest aspects of the new religion is how they ascertain the friend/enemy distinction. The zealots seem to be more and more motivated by simply rejecting what their enemies are embracing. You see this in environmentalism when they flock to farming mega-corps when we espouse the virtues of regenerative farming, or in Germany when they re-fire coal plants in order to close down their nuclear power. If there was a 100% clean, infinite energy source, the environmentalists would probably be against it just because the ‚Äúbad people‚Äù are for it.Probably the strangest modern example is he left vilifying an anti-human-trafficking movie simply because the wrong people like it.It used to be the right got their cues about their beliefs from what the left didn‚Äôt want, and now it seems to have completely reversed.

            Well, if you look at how prior religions metastasized, it always snowballed once the religion became a means of displaying higher social status.  Social status in our society is largely based on how far removed you are from hillbillies, so wokeism appeals to that by simply believing the opposite of whatever a redneck would believe.

                Christianization was not uniform. It was a bottom up affair in the core of the Roman empire. In Gaul it was more of a top down process as Roman power waned. In other parts of Europe it was an evolution that resulted in a different religion. Christianity in Scandia, for example, was never the same thing in practice, as it was in Rome.

                Clearly, Christianity raised the status of women in the ancient world. Paganism valued women, if at all, only as sexual commodities, and highly perishable ones at that. The nurturing aspect embodied by the  Virgin Mary, as well as other women in the New Testament, has a longer shelf life, literally.
Note that I do not view this development as an entirely unalloyed good. Empowered women have their downsides for society.

                    Yes, Christianity was the first-wave feminism of its day. I am not disparaging Christianity here‚Ä¶I agree with first-wave feminism.
Women are valued members and saints. I can‚Äôt think of another religion that holds women in as high a regard. But it merely elevated women from being chattel; it didn‚Äôt reject family and biology like the progressive religions do. That was enough.

            There was some practical advantages to conversion. Clovis converted and made sure to be on good terms with the bishops for purely practical reasons. Whether he was ever a genuine believer is debatable. He issued edicts in defense of the Catholic church, but rarely enforced them. He also appointed his people to positions within the church, thus coopting it.
On the other hand, there were German tribes that rejected the Gallo-Roman Christianity in favor of Arianism for cultural reasons, but Arianism provided the rulers with tools that the old gods did not in terms of social organization.

                The conversion to Christianity in  Anglo-Saxon Briton was generally a practical affair. Sometimes it was done to curry favor.woth Frankish kings, especially if the Anglo-Saxon king was married to a French noble woman.
Other times, the Anglo-Saxon kings realized the advantages of a literate class and the added authority Christianity gave them.
Britain is an interesting case. Pagan to Christian to pagan to Christian.and almost back to pagan.

                It‚Äôs odd to me that so many people assert the conversion of Clovis was insincere. Conversions of rulers are always constrained by prudence, but people seem to think that if he didn‚Äôt become a monk or something, then maybe it was merely instrumental. He never went back to worshipping the old gods; not sure what more we would expect.Peter Heather wrote a history of the era and seemed to think it would scandalize the faithful by pointing out Clovis entertained Arianism before deciding on orthodoxy ‚Äì as if the ruling class in Spain, western France, all of Italy, and north Africa (for a time) being Arians should have no weight, whatever.Don‚Äôt get it.

                Trinitarianism has many aspects which leech away masculinity. It wants us to‚Ä¶‚Ä¢ Reject our own patriarchs for Israel‚Äôs,‚Ä¢ Submit to a degrading guilt trip which is promoted under the rubric of ‚Äúoriginal sin‚Äù,‚Ä¢ Honor Joseph, a probable cuckold‚Ä¢ Pretend that Mary was impregnated miraculously by a god, not by Joseph before marriage nor by another man,‚Ä¢ Love our enemies indiscriminately,‚Ä¢ Believe that the poor in spirit are blessed,‚Ä¢ Turn the other cheek,‚Ä¢ Take no care for the morrow,‚Ä¢ Agree that ‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù even though it‚Äôs obvious that the god, if it were real, would be damning most humans to Hell, for the god (again, assuming its existence) chooses to let most humans be born in conditions which make faith in Jesus unlikely,‚Ä¢ Worship Jesus, a sadomasochist who committed suicide with assistance,‚Ä¢ Accept the scriptural testimony of hysterical women who are said to have found Jesus‚Äô tomb empty,‚Ä¢ Turn a blind eye to passages in John about the disciple whom Jesus loved,‚Ä¢ Believe still more risible nonsense like the Ascension and the Real Presence,‚Ä¢ Accept that a believer is a member of a flock of sheep,‚Ä¢ Respect parents and elders who accept Trinitarian drivel,‚Ä¢ Suspend or suppress basically all street smarts, and‚Ä¢ Push this bizarre cult upon the whole world.

            Oh gawd. Another escaped trailer park intellectual from Jim‚Äôs Blog. Expect Bubbles to come along any moment. It makes you wonder where these goofs went to school and who taught them.Christianity has produced the best men the world has ever seen. The best warriors were historically Christian. As were the best architects, the best shipwrights, the best captains and navigators, the best scientists, the best builders ‚Äì all had their roots in Christianity. Hell‚Äôs bells‚Ä¶even blacks can be raised from utter squalor by the faith. The best families and fathers and sons are Christians.Contrary to Jim and his self proclaimed alphas, Game players and PUA‚Äôs ‚Äì Christians also produced the best concept of marriage too. Marriage is seen as a union where both partners divide labour and combine resources. The partners play to their strengths, cover for the weaknesses and limitations of the other and accomplish more together as a team than they do alone. They produce better children too. Guys like Jim, Roosh, and other manosphere flunkies produce bastards, cat ladies, and justification for the lopsided laws that unfairly favour women in marriage and the workplace. Christians understand that if you hurt or punish one gender, ultimately you will hurt them both. And when your families fall apart‚Ä¶your community, state and nation won‚Äôt be far behind.

        ‚Äú Christianity pushed out paganism in Europe because it offered something that paganism either did not offer or did not address‚Ä¶‚Äù$Accounting$.  The monks were literate and could count money and taxpayers and the Barbarians who weren‚Äôt Christian-because the Germans who took over Rome were- needed tax revenue and so literacy, and so Clerics became Clerks.Gaia same thing;  The actual corporate polluters who do put heavy metals in the water table realize that all idealists seek money, as Marx with Engels.   They rigged the Corporate research grant game so Carbon and CO2 became the poison, this is a much easier sell as you can now tax people for breathing, you WILL NOT get any research grant these days without checking the Global Warming block, and crony politicians were happy to rig the government research grants the same way.  (Source experienced DC lawyer).I don‚Äôt think it all comes down to money, but I‚Äôm apparently a regressive freak cursed with morality.

            This is dumb.

‚ÄúAh! But it was all fake, see? The rulers never believed it, they just pretended to believe so they could get those literate and numerate monks to do their work,‚Äù etc.

        ‚Äúthe result is a collection of beliefs that define a group of people and give them an elevated sense of status‚ÄùThis is the conclusion that I‚Äôve come to having lived almost all of my life on the leftist west coast.  The major appeal of this belief system is the sense of superiority that it grants the believer and the license to hate those outside of the group.  Smugness and condescension flow from this group towards the non-believers.  Take my sister, for example.  Please‚Ä¶All of their humorists, Colbert, Stewart, drip with scorn for those who don‚Äôt believe.  Smugness is the well from which almost all of their humor springs.Why these privileged people have so much spite and condescension towards others, which requires a means of expression like leftism, is less clear to me.

            I tend to agree with you on this one LineInTheSand. I witnessed it first hand in the land of the Smug Index for many years and later in the island borough that is the world‚Äôs capital city ‚Äì even worse there.It seems like it is a gigantic doom loop. It also explains why they make cause with the black grievance mongers. Misery likes company.The system of rootless college to corporation status and power seeking is very destructive of the human soul. Loyalty to the nation was replaced with loyalty to the Degree Stamping Institution. That was a thin veneer over loyalty to oneself, as life became a game of self service and status seeking. But, the shock and horror to find out that there is an endless train of the next graduates coming after you, even if from lesser schools as you sit at your useless job of a branding expert or market.Destroying/abandoning our natural local communities unleashed a rootless army of credentialed status seekers. Shipping away real productive endeavors created a class of people with no shame in going about performative act after performative act of self promotion. Commoditizing credentialization and replacing higher education with credentialism ensured that a class of people with a toxic combination of inflated self-opinion, woeful ignorance, nay anti-knowledge when it comes to history and civics, massive anxiety due to abandoning tradition and responding to it by further attacking, is a fiery clown car laced with dynamite. They lash out as the honors become more hollow and meaningless. The soul must be nourished in the halls of humility, but they instead fill its yearnings with anger and judgement.That kind of hatred is a two way street. The 90s ‚Äì 2020 were about showing their hatred for Flyover Country. 2020 ‚Äì ??? is about showing their hatred for their fellow rootless credentialists. They are on their luxury cruise and freaking out that they have to see those pesky ruffians in the economy cabins. Or they are a ruffian freaking out that they will be discovered by the gold cabin class to be in an economy cabin. In the meantime, they spawn iceberg after iceberg of enmity.In the dead of which night the ship of fools and which mountain of ice cold retribution they hit is unknown. It is bound to happen someday.

            Yeah, I‚Äôve lived around these people for 20 years. They‚Äôre signaling their membership to a club, a club that they feel gives them the right to look down on other whites.What‚Äôs fascinating is how the club is almost exclusively whites. Non-whites are just props, which  is why they get so confused and, frankly, a bit upset when Asians and Indians start to join the club. (Blacks are okay but they‚Äôre special and no threat.)Lefty whites don‚Äôt know what to do with Indians and Asians that start harping on white priviledge. First, the lefty whites lose status in the club because non-whites always trump whites. Second, lefty whites don‚Äôt like the priviledge accusation aimed them. Even if the Indian or Asian isn‚Äôt specifically saying left whites are evil, it‚Äôs understood that they ‚Äì by being white ‚Äì are still part of the problem.

                I disagree. I think white Leftists, in their perversity, revel in being condemned for their whiteness and their alleged priviledge. It gives them a masochistic frisson, and allows them to play the martyr‚Äôs role at the same time.

        Marxism, environmentalism, anti-racism and wokism are all offshoots of liberal-enlightenment philosophy.  The only difference is the area of focus.  Underlying all of them is the idea that liberated man can build utopia.  With marxism it was liberation from markets and economics; with the modern iterations it is liberation from biology.In all cases they are narcissistic hubris.   Even environmentalism superficially elevates nature, but at core is the belief that  humans are dominating nature in a negative, disastrous way.  People that truly worshipped nature would not think that man was capable of destroying the planet.  Those morons actually do believe that.  Which reveals a belief in the supremacy of humans ‚Äì just a twisted one.All of the mutations of the liberal-enlightenment philosophy are forms of gnosticism.  They all involve a belief in a hidden or secret knowledge, that their contemporary world is evil, and that it can be transformed by the secret knowledge.The appeal of theses faiths is to the ego and hope of the acolytes.  They are superior because they have the secret knowledge. Which makes them smarter than those who lack it.  And they are morally superior because they will use that secret knowledge to improve the life of everyone. Their activism is therefor selfless ‚Äì even if they too benefit from it.

            Your point about secret knowledge is a good one. However, I locate this knowledge in the realm of postmodern philosophy‚Äìor theory as they prefer to call it.Any literate, intelligent person who picks up a postmodern text will be utterly baffled by what he encounters. The language, the postmodern liturgy if you will, is utterly bizarre, and from a semantic and grammatical standpoint, simply does not make sense roughly 50 percent of the time. This moeity is incoherent gibberish.But the postmodern initiate doesn‚Äôt see it that way. She will claim that there is meaning, and that only those who have devoted countless hours to decoding the language, can grasp that meaning. This meaning, which constitutes a body of knowledge, is fundamentally occult. It is unknowable to outsiders, but is a source of great power to the acolytes and hierophants.And indeed, this has proved the case. The inscrutibility of postmodernism has generated a penumbra of prestige around it in Leftist intellectual circles. So much so that postmodernism has become the ipso facto intellectual foundation of the New Left, which controls the West. This process has been ongoing since the second half of the 60s.

        ‚ÄúChristianity pushed out paganism in Europe because it offered something that paganism either did not offer or did not address as well as the new religion.‚Äù
Anything that could be a rival to Catholic Christianity was brutally stomped on and extirpated. Including variants of Christianity that were promptly labeled heresies. Most of the folk religions and practices of pre-Christian Europe got this treatment and it‚Äôs a miracle they still managed to survive in odd nooks and crannies. The first victim of Christianity was the high culture of the Greco-Roman world.

            Anything that could be a rival to Catholic Christianity was brutally stomped on and extirpated. Including variants of Christianity that were promptly labeled heresies.That narrative is pretty overblown because the Papacy lacked the power to do that before the twelfth century, and even then only in north-western Europe.There was a lot of schismatism between ~300ad and 800ad which the empire fought with vary limited degrees of success. But that was not the heavy repression of later middle ages, and mostly failed.As a side note, christianity splintered from the very beginning ‚Äì throwing off innumerable offshoots that labeled each other as heresies.

                Sure. Look at the various ecumenical councils, beginning with Nicea. The two major versions that emerged victorious were Catholicism in Europe and the Orthodox Church in Byzantium. Efforts to reconcile the two failed.
Christianity began as a variant of Judaism. The failure to attract enough Jews led to casting the net further to snare Goyim. But to do this Greek philosophical ideas had to be added to the mix. This was an ongoing process that continued right up to Aquinas in the 13th century, with his synthesis of Christian theology and Aristotelianism.

                    Forgive my corrections, but:During Jesus‚Äôs ministry Jews were the prime targets of his message. But even during his ministry, he said he was going to welcome the Gentile, and he did so on several occasions. From the beginning, Christianity was universalist. Not a failing Jewish cult.‚ÄúCatholicism‚Äù (AKA Universalism) was the entire Christian church until the high middle ages. There was no east-west thing until The Crusades (some say the Great Schism of 1054) was the cause of the split between Roman and Byzantine Christianity. And it was over Papal authority, of course, with the help of idiot bands of Crusaders.

                        Basically true, Marko. However, eastern Christianity always tended to emphasize the divine component of the triune god as manifested in Christ, while western Christianity played up his human element. But this difference was more de facto than de jure. In other words, it was more practical than doctrinal.

            They were labeled heresies because they were heresies.  Either Arianism was true (the Second and Third Persons of the Trinity were created) or it was false. If false, then a heresy. If true, then holding They were uncreated is the heresy. Both can‚Äôt be true.
