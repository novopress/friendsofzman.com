        This election cycle is notable in that, for the first time, the regime has begun putting forward presidential candidates who are incapable of “debating,” even in a rigged, staged “debate” setting. Incapable of even giving a staged, rehearsed interview without having an old white guy alongside to mansplain. You could say it’s a flex on their part, you could say it’s a sign of decline, of incompetents failing up, but you can’t deny it.Earnest civnats would tell you this is because they can no longer find anyone better to run for president, but I doubt that. More like, the regime will no longer allow anyone better to run for president.

            Why would any sane person run for president? To have every skeleton in your closet exposed to the country and have half the country hating your guts, all so a handful of rich Jews can tell you what your policies are.

                True. You have to be 1) an amoral narcissist 2) a dull people-pleasing optimist 3) a dumb idealist to even want a taste of the Washington game.
I wonder which one is JD Vance? It very much pains me to write that.
I will only presume to be President if drafted, or if our alien overlords install me because they recognize my hyper-wisdom. But they’ll have to surround me with their invisible personal defense shields or else I’ll getso assassinated.

                        He didn’t write anything. That’s what the people pulling the puppet strings do. It’s part of the standard marketing package to introduce a new “made man” to the public. They also did that for Zero.

                Yes. But remember, in todays demonic, value-inverted society, having “every skeleton in your closet exposed to the country” would be something to be celebrated.
Look! Candidate X was a junkie in her younger years! So strong!Look! Candidate Y was an armed robber in her younger years, but she showed great form to get where she is today! Go her!Look! Candidate Z has orgies with children – he’s expressing himself! We mustn’t judge!

                    Even starting a gay club for the kids in PE class is now a virtue. And sleeping your way up the political ladder not a vice. According to the media. Perhaps the voters still take a different view, if they are allowed to have a say.

                        For years I remember the media looking wistfully across the Atlantic at the French and how, say, an affair would not derail a politician’s career because they are oh-so-enlightened about sex compared to us stodgy prude Americans. This is especially in relation to political careers of handsome, dashing Chads, people the members of the media presumably liked and/or desired (consider who works for the media, a lot of women and gays), who got derailed because they cheated on their wives.At some point they stopped trying to change our minds and just declared that there is no perversion or degeneracy that renders someone off-limits for political office. They even whined about that “throuple” slut having to resign. At some point they just stopped pretending to care what we think and just went full mask-off.

                            At some point they just stopped pretending to care what we think and just went full mask-off.Remarkable, isn’t it? The scope and the speed of the cultural decline. The way that male and female relationships have been warped is one of the saddest results of Leftism.This is why I simply cannot bring myself to vote. Whether I hold my nose or not, voting for some person issome sort of endorsementof them. I cannot endorse those whom I know to share not one shred of common morality.I think of the public faces of the politicians we see before us, and imagine the daily, almost non-stop lying and deceit that lurks behind the fascia.

Good point. The counterpoint is that because the church decided charging interest was sinful, and would deny the sacraments and Christian burial to parishioners who did so, the warriors of Christendom did the white thing, obeyed their leaders, and stood down. Abandoned the field of battle to our bestest buddies ever.
Without good Christian men to moderate, our bestest buddies ever created a financial system designed to bleed Christians dry, and to benefit their tribe.
Was standing down was the right thing to do?

                It’s also the arbitrariness of it all which makes public life so impossible. They can manufacture outrage at your skeletons or celebrate them, depending upon whether or not they find some profit in your actions. Short of any real scandals, they simply make something up.

            From the perspective of the regime, the primary qualification for high office is now pliability. They want someone stupid who will do what they are told, without any inconvenient ideas of their own (this is why they got rid of Andrew Cuomo, btw). Harris is perfect in this regard, even better than Biden (no old man tantrums- hell, she’s even beyond PMS at this point. Maybe some alcoholic contrarianism, but that’s what Xanax is for.

            No more Presidential debates? There are a lot of people, including Martin Armstrong’s AI, who think there will be no more Presidential elections after this one…If the current situation is chaotic, 2028 will be chaotic on steroids…Head for the hills time….

            The designated puppet has to be absolutely controllable, sure. But putting forward an obvious dementia patient followed by someone unable to hide their profound stupidity indicates pure sadism. The intent behind first Biden and then Harris is to humiliate. Yes, it is a flex as well, but the intent is much darker. The same applies to populating small white heartland towns with Third World savages. Those who actually control the West despise its indigenous and heritage populations enough to torture and torment their subjects. It is a precursor to trying to kill them, obviously, and goes well beyond totalitarian control.

                I realized this when I saw the Dems put up a braindead hobo who couldn’t understand the spoken word for a Senate seat, and demand their shills line up and support him. I remember, shortly before the election, I was driving through Philadelphia, the nice part of Philadelphia, and seeing signs for him. I thought, these people are likely executives, finance people, doctors, lawyers, scientists, professors, people who are ostensibly intelligent and worked to get to their station in life, and they are forced to support an addled caveman to rule over them. It’s just pure humiliation but as you talk about, it gets much worse with every passing year.

                    I don’t think it is a humiliation for this class of professionals. I think that is how degraded and stupid they are.ShoppingMallica places no value on any externality to being a maximalist consumption vehicle. This includes any sort of real culture. You don’t need culture. You can buy a brand and show how cultured and elite you are.Those doctors, lawyers, executives … … live on a conveyor belt. Burbs, high-school w/ copious SAT prep to college for credentialing and nothing else to job and then career. Fetterman doesn’t need to be competent or good or well presented. He just needs to be nice and stick up for the downtrodden so that their vote means they are nice and sticking up for the downtrodden. They feel no humiliation or shame. They were born into this humiliating and shameful existence. The ability to live in that neighborhood and put up that sign is the compensation for that something that they probably don’t know is missing.Have you seen a recent speech at any elite high school by a Yale/Harvard/MIT/… bound valedictorian? Granted I have a small sample size. I kid you not that the tenor of the ones I hear are the equivalent of the bad Valentines cards I wrote in first grade and the subject matter is shocking in how vaccuous it is. Hallmark cards are more interesting – and entertaining.Absurd people behave in an absurd manner and they are formed in and by an absurd society/system.

        My prediction for some time has been that Harris will “win,” Don is toast and if it’s close the Dems will cheat.
That being said I am pleasantly surprised at how close the polls are and how many young men seem to be rejecting Harris.
Who would have guessed that young males who actually have to work for a living are not keen on voting for an entitled, stupid, nonwhite female who slept her way to the top?

                Probably the best thing about Trump winning is it’d set the leftard’s collective hair on fire.  Granted, the incessant lefty yammering about Orangeman bad, tyrannical, Hitler is extremely tiresome to say the least, but it can be quite entertaining as well…. Oh, and “free speech” being labeled a threat to democracy – hell, we’re damn near there.

                It’s great. It has totally put the libs on the defensive. They are putting out articles about how AKSHULLY the Haitians aren’t eating cats in Springfield, they’re doing it in Columbus or whatever, like this is just a stunning fact check. It seems like they ordered the local police to refute it, but if you read the police statements carefully, they arenotrefuting it. They are saying stuff like, “it isn’t on our radar now”, well no kidding, whatison cops’ radar these days?People need to hammer Kamala as the president that will protect Haitians’ right to eat your cat and the ducks at the park until election day.

                    I don’t think Haitians should be here, and I definitely think they shouldn’t be eating park animals. That’s just detestable. It’s a perfect metaphor for third-world immigration.BUT let me stick up for the Haitians for a sec. I suspect that the Haitians were not moved into “Springfield”, rather the poor area of Springfield. Which in many small cities is populated by poor white people with a bunch of loose and dirty animals – I mean pets – everywhere. The poorer white you are, the more animals you have. They seem to have a nasty obsession with collecting random “fur babies”. I’ll bet the Haitians mistook the poor areas for literally being in a third-world slum (which they tend to look like) which happened to be overrun by animals.Why weren’t the locals eating these?They asked themselves. I’ll bet most Haitians don’t understand the concept of pets, much less the white concept of having too many of them, all looking ragged from being adopted from shelters or births from not being spayed/neutered.

                        I find it hard to believe that any Haitian would think any part of the USA is a third world slum. Even the worst part of Camden is like Malibu compared to Haiti.In any case, what you are pointing to is the basic difference in norms and values. I don’t want to live around people who don’t understand the concept of pets. It’s just ridiculous that I should be forced to, or that I should have to spend my time trying to explain it to people with a sub-70 IQ. What we are seeing here is the Haitian way of life being imposed on non-Haitians. If Port-au-Prince doesn’t have geese in the park, neither does Springfield. They need to go back.

                                My suggestion, given that they are coming over here, is to bring back colonialism. Occupy Haiti and run the place as a sort of “repository” for such creatures, well outside of where their presence would cause damage to the nation.  We must commit to an occupation of a century or more.Of course, they are not “coming over here”. They are being brought here by the usual suspects. Nonetheless, it is worth any amount of “blood and treasure” to keep them out of the country. We should have learned our lesson from the Somalis we imported.With the possible exception of Muslims, I never made such extreme recommendations.

Open borders is what is extreme.  Turning a country (if not exactly a nation) into a multiethnic empire is what is extreme.

                            I was trying to explain that this is what happens when you import a bunch of people who eat whatever runs by into a population of people that have too many pets. And I don’t think these Haitians are eating people’s golden retrievers…they’re eating one of the dozens of raggedy dogs and cats roaming around any given poverty-stricken white area.
This is akin to the argument we make about young white women going out in sexy outfits amongst an aggressive male population. I blame the aggressive males, but I also blame the woman a bit.

                                Foraging for small animals: It’s not just poor areas. Stray, abandoned, feral dogs/cats are a problem everywhere. And of course, almost any area that has lakes and ponds will have waterfowl etc. A Haitain’s paradise, I guess.
As for men preying on women, well not always…

                            Indeed, you are not.  Haitians are a very special case of taking the worst of Africa and allowing it to degenerate for 10 generations in relative isolation.  It is the human replication of the “Universe 25” experiment conducted by American ethologist John B. Calhoun in the 1960s and 1970s.

                        Read and weep. Here is today’s missive on Haitian IQ I received in the mail:https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/average-iq-of-haitiIt is simply *not* possible to adapt such people to a 1st world, technological society. They and their offspring will *never* rise to a level of self maintenance and contribution required.One of two things must happen: ‘Haitians remain a subculture within the main culture, living in their self created ghetto slums, parasitically preying upon the main culture’, or ‘Haitians mix their genes with the prevailing populace through miscegenation, thereby degrading the ability of the main culture to function at the high level needed’. Most likely a bit of both to be sure.We already have seen such with our “native” Black population—and they are 25% White admixture! 150 years later and we are still suffering from the effects their presence in society.

                        No lie detected, 13 downvotes.You can’t import savages and then act surprised when they do savage things; the savages are not the problem, the problem is the people who let them in.A Commie pol here in Denmark visited her clients in a mosque and now she’s offended that their holy man wouldn’t shake her hand. Her party has been yammering about multi-culti for two decades, Adolf-shaming everybody even remotely critical. But when she actually meets someone that’s unapologetically practicing his culture, rather than act Danish around Danes, she gets offended.Let me up the ante and extend my personal thanks to those voodoo-joggers. For the price of a cat, you’ve converted more libs than ten mass stabbings.

                        28 down votes, really??? I volunteer at a cat/dog shelter and I tend to agree with Marko’s characterization of poor whites and their devil-may-care attitude towards their pets, all too often. And Marko should not be punished for portraying the Haitians are they really (probably) are. They hail from the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere; you’d have to look in Africa to find worse. At subsistence levels of “civilization,” nearly any animal is fair game for food. Those Haitians are probsbly doing what seems most rational to them in their situation. The only problem is that they should be doing it in Haiti, not in a small town in Ohio.I’ll go Marko one better and I’m sure I speak for a lot of people here:Those Haitians, and (in my xenophobic opinion at least) the vast majority of other immigrants, legal or not, should never have been allowed into our country in the first place. Certainly not allowed to stay at our expense.Correcting the above problem is going to be extremely unpleasant, and I fear it may not even be possible at this late date. I suspect we will find out one way or the other.

                One of 2020’s innovations instate capacity: Media calls of electoral results are final, binding, and The Law. They’ll just say she won, like they did with Biden, and that’s that. Soldiers will occupy the capital and aim their rifles out at us—again.Remember Republicans lamenting that Fox called Arizona before the count began (statistically)? That call was not only sacred but eternal. Arizona will never be “red” again.Millions of MAGA guys, Trump included, were banned from everything forcontradicting the television.Novel crimes were invented to imprison election—electioncoverage—”deniers.”Etc.The coup was military. The junta it installed is the media. It isliterally criminalto contradict it.

                Well, that worked fine in Venezuela just recently, although those in charge had to take the extra step of sending the army to secure the radio and TV stations.  Not needed here where all media, especially social media, is safely in regime hands.

        Debates will be unnecessary for no other reason than presidential elections will be a forgone conclusion. Whites were 85% of eligible voters in 1995. That dropped to 69% in 2019. The oldest Boomers are 78 years old. The actuarial tables are about to kick in and reduce whites at a much faster clip.Of course, for presidential elections, it’s all about the states so let’s look at the coming death of the GOP by key state. Here’s the share of white voters in 2000 compared to 2018 for the states that matter:Texas: 62% vs 51%Florida: 74% vs 61%Arizona: 75% vs 63%Georgia: 68% vs 58%Pennsylvania: 87% vs 81%North Carolina: 75% vs 69%Nevada: 76% vs 58%Most of those states saw the white voter count fall by around ten percentage points over 18 years, so ~0.5% a year. That will accelerate with the passing of the Boomers, so in four years, Florida’s voters will be majority non-white. Nevada will be close.Trump has a good shot. There’s even a shot for a GOP candidate in 2028, though it’ll be very slim. But that’s it. That’s the end. By 2032, there will be no path for a Republican presidential candidate, not that it matters because they are pointless cucks, but at some point, conservative American whites will realize that they are forever a despised minority in country where the federal government is controlled by people who hate them.

                Whites share of military recruits have fallen from ~60% five years ago to ~40-45% now. Young whites are getting the message. And that number will fall even more. Just as whites don’t want to live in minority neighborhoods, they don’t want to work at a place where they’re a minority.

            That’s probably not true.  The two party state will most likely be safe.  Instead of a one party state, the uniparty will become even more indistinguishable than they are now.  The GOP will simply move further to the left.  It will pander even more to the mestizo vote than it does now.  Why does anyone believe the GOP will remain a White party (at least in rhetoric) with Whites only being a plurality?  It might take a couple of lost elections, but they will adapt.

                It’s not about ideas. Non-whites view the GOP as the “white” party. They won’t vote for it. The country will look demographically and politically like California.

            Demographics is the only thing that matters.  But people still want to discuss electoral politics, ‘socialism’ vs. ‘capitalism,’ abortion, food additives, etc.  All those things can be decided in a White polity – yes, even if it includes the 30% of woke leftist Whites.  But the demographics in AINO are the oncoming freight train and most don’t have a clue.  Even your statistics from 2018 are outdated now, given the massive immigration, increased non-White births, and White deaths in the past 4 years.

                Yep. Ideas only matter in a homogeneous country. Once you go multiracial, the only thing that matters in politics is demographics.Whites – liberal and conservative – have no clue what’s about to hit them. California whites fled as a responsive. What happens when no state is safe? What happens when normal whites are a minority in every state in the union? Because that’s coming. There will be no state where normal, conservative whites make up a majority of the voters. Liberal whites and non-whites will be the majority in every state outside of a few mountain states within 10 years.

                    What happens is they decide if they want to carry on as the Remnant of European civilization. Other factors of how radicalized they get in terms of digging in to a racial identity and a distinct cultural group are: how much affluence the system can promise them; how intense the anti-White pogrom remains, abates or increases.

I truly believe our posterity is going to do it – if we do our part and nurture positive identity and transmit our heritage and our culture and tell them what was lost so that they do everything required to get all of it back.

                    It is highly questionable that the United States will be effectively governable at all in ten years save for infrequent outbursts of state violence and raw exercises of power. That may be fine with TPTB, of course, but the GAE’s reach will grow smaller within its original borders similar to how it is swiftly receding abroad. The Regime probably in time will permit the unclean to pay the jizya and do their own thing out of public view until the jizya itself becomes impossible to collect. The ongoing dissolution and fragmentation are the counter to the demographic replacement, and both will speed up. Nihilism likely will follow totalitarianism.

                    Allracial bean counting is either self-reported (as in the census) or includes anyone not obviously black as White (as in police reports).  The 2030 census will, for the first time, have a MENA category with an Iranian sub-category.  Everything else up to and including the presents lumps in Iranians, Syrians, Palestinians, etc. as White.  Many subcon Indians also check the White category depending on caste (it’s a status thing with them).  So, too, do many South American mestizos, of 10-50% non-White admixture.  And, of course, Jews also check the White box, although they will have the MENA option in 2030.So – officially in 2020 the White % of the population was 57.9%.  That included Jews (depending on if one includes 25-50%ers, that’s 2-4%) and Arabs (another 2%) and the various subcons and mestizos.  So Whites of European Christian descent were about 53% of AINO’s population in 2020.  Today?  Easily less than 50%.

                “All those things can be decided in a White polity – yes, even if it includes the 30% of woke leftist Whites.”
Whistling past the graveyard.
Rich white enclaves can only be bombed into rubble. There is absolutely nothing they have ever “compromised” on, nor will they ever. These people did not get their views based on facts or reason, so cannot be reasoned out of it. Evanston, IL needs to be razed to the ground and salt sown on the ruins. That’s the only way all these things can be decided in a White polity.

                    I have seen a nature video where two antelope are locking horns and fighting, oblivious to everything, while a leopard saunters up for the slaughter. Upper class Whites have been engaged in a one sided civil war against their blue collar brethren for decades. They have used the 3rd world hordes as a bludgeon against poor Whites. Well these 3rd worlders aren’t content with just being a voting block and step ‘n fetchits for the establishment. Yes there are influential minority groups pushing agendas but none of what is occurring today would be happening without the full support of the White power structure, past and present. These idiots have literally put the long term survival of the White race on planet earth in jeopardy and I don’t feel that is hyperbole.

Preach it. While the “Judeo” prong played a heavy role, everything we see today is the master plan of the “Puritan” wing. Not that it improves our lives, but they indeed will reign in hell.

            I’m just thinking out loud here, but currently a lot of whites, especially women, vote Dem.  As whites become more of a despised minority, and the hate greatly increases, perhaps that will radicalize them and make up for the lost numbers, with many of them abandoning the Dems.  Just a thought.

                That likely will happen. You see it in the South. So, it’s possible the GOP hangs on a bit longer, but the country’s politics will resemble California at some point. Even in the South, the GOP will fade.

            but at some point, conservative American whites will realize that they are forever a despised minority in country where the federal government is controlled by people who hate them.If they don’t know this by now I don’t think they will realize it until they are being held over the cannibal’s pot basically.I know two conservatards who are constantly droning on about how the left doesn’t play fair. And “I’m so mad that Minneapolis voted to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer 5 times a day, why not the Our Father?”They are just so ticked off! They may even write an angry letter to an editor. Sorry to Z for this next part but you either need to start eliminating people or accept your fate. I know approximately zero people who have the stomach for the type of work that needs to be done. Either boxcars or ammo boxes are required, period.We who truly understand the calculus are still rather a minority and by the time the majority realize it as I said, they will be either headed to a camp or up against a wall.

        “The abolition of rights, the pogroms and censorship all point to a time when the regime simply decides there is nothing to debate and puts an end to all public debate.”From the Clinton-Dole debate from ’96 to the present time, I can’t recall much of any substance in any presidential debate. Trump brought some new ideas in the 2016 debates but as an outsider having a fun time, not expecting to win, and relatively little censorship (because the regime didn’t expect him to win either), he could afford to do so. In the current stultifying atmosphere, I don’t expect him to show the same devil-may-care attitude and as you’re indicating, there debates — such as they were — may soon be a thing of the past.Harris is a low-IQ apparatchik of the regime — no brain, no style, no command of language, no command of policy. But she does have an infectious laugh. Sort of like the neighing of Incitatus. The regime has figured out that iif it could install a low-IQ senile old gasbag like Biden, why not Harris? Harris will be Biden 2.0. Same foreign and domestic policies as the empire goes down the drain.

        It is possible this may be the last presidential debate we see at all.I plan to raise a toast tonight, because it absolutely is. I am bidding farewell to the US I’ve known all my life tonight. I don’t know what’s coming next, but whatever it is, it will finish off everything I have known.As a young man in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR and the opportunities it provided for the US — knowing all of that, having lived through it — I simply cannot believe what has occurred to this nation since then. It is unfathomable. If I could somehow have warned myself, I would have moved and built a life elsewhere on earth.This is not quitting, or a blackpill, but reality, because I worked like a dog in education for decades to educate the youth — I put in the work at the university level — and failed. I didn’t sit on the couch and write comments online (not suggesting anyone here is, but that’s the most common criticism we hear). No, not due to my own errors, but because I was fighting a war alone. Not a single family member or friend who’s spent the past four years bitching and moaning about “kids today” ever bothered to inquire about my career in education, and in fact, quietly smirked at it while I struggled to pay rent and eventually, quit for something that paid more than pennies on the dollar.Well, the bill is coming, I tell my remaining friends, the invoice is here. But not from me, like you thought it would.

I did that directly Biden was inaugurated. But the destruction of the Boy Scouts and the forced integration of women’s public restrooms were dire auguries of what was soon to come.
How ironic that winning the Cold War was the final inflection point in America’s demise. What looked to be the beginning of a Platinum Age instead saw a fissure crack open along the Continental Divide and every spawn of Hades rise to the surface and rule.

                I wrote it off when Reagan didn’t amount to a tempest in a teapot. Eight years and couldn’t even undo the damage Jimmy did in 4.
I had that one uncle everyone has, and he decided there was little to no hope back in the 70s. Something like, “Country’s damn near 90% white, sad to think half of ’em ‘r worthless faggots stealin’ anything not nailed down. Country’s goin’ to hell.”
An all-white polity is not the answer. Maybe a little slower trainwreck, that’s it. Once whites decided to eat the seed corn, it was all over.

Do you have an alternative answer?
My answer is a white ethnostate that explicitly states that its highest value is the flourishing of white people.  Anything that is inconsistent with that highest value, like non-white immigration or the promotion of sexual deviancy, is illegal.

                        Same issue, though. We can’t get to a white ethnostate. At the moment, even proposing it would have maybe 90% of whites wanting to put you in prison.
Someone above said it. Whenever the wheels come off, some whites, particularly the blue collar rural and semi-rural will disproportionately survive. Maybe even thrive.
Once they pull through, then we should definitely implement a white ethnostate.

                    “I wrote it off when Reagan didn’t amount to a tempest in a teapot.”Very disappointing at the time.  49 State win, good economy, Cold War Win, spirits were running high. . .and it was all down the memory hole the second he was out of office.  There was no one to carry-on in the slightest.And of course in retrospect, Reagan’s accomplishments were quickly erased and didn’t equal his mistakes.Even in the 80s; humpty dumpty couldn’t be put back together again.  There was no going back to the 50s and Lassie and all that; no matter how many or how much a lot of people wanted to.

                        “And of course in retrospect, Reagan’s accomplishments were quickly erased and didn’t equal his mistakes.”A little more study and a lot less trashing is in order here.Reagan can be argued to have “won” the Cold War, but that was never apparent during his Presidency.  The collapse of the USSR did not occur until Dec 1991, about three years into the Bush presidency.  What Reagan did accomplish was to strengthen the military and bring the US back from a retreat on the global stage—whether that was a good thing is certainly debatable, but under Reagan we recovered from our ignominious retreat from Vietnam and our inability to rescue our hostages in Iran.Reagan *never* had full control of Congress, hence to slight him as a failure is a bit of a reach.  He did what he could with the Executive power he had.  He was forced to bargain with the Dem’s to exchange a rise in military spending for a rise in social spending.This was bad of course, especially since both were done via deficit spending.  He did however, “fix”, Social Security in a bipartisan deal with the Dem’s.  The deal straightened out finances up to the early 2000’s.  It was never said at the time to extend beyond 2000 or so.  Prior to that “deal” SS had no automatic cost of living (COLA) provisions and no “trust fund” to speak of.Perhaps the best thing that can be said of Reagan was that he did “do little”.  We were coming off LBJ, Nixon, and Carter who basically turned this country into a welfare and regulatory State on steroids. Heck, under Nixon, a purported conservative, we had the EPA, the ESA, CEQ/NEPA, and NOAA formed.  The country was in a mood for a bit of stability and settling down to digest all this progressive change.Carter enacted the DOE in the face of the energy crisis and oil embargo. Reagan ameliorate that and allowed massive drilling and production of local resources.  No more gas shortages.Reagan also held firm on Federal employees attempting to strike (against the terms of their employment contract as Federal workers) by firing all air traffic controllers who did not return to work.  I don’t believe there have been any organized walkouts since, albeit there have been some points of unrest settled—examples, TSA, Postal Workers, etc.

                            I don’t read his comment as anti-Reagan. Mine wasn’t. It was the cold realization the wheels were coming off, and there was no peaceful way to stop it.
Sure, we could maybe get rid of the white shitlibs’ pets, or down to a manageable number, but there are always more they can bring in. Africa alone is fecund enough to make that a futile gesture.
Unless and until those who want the pets are persuaded or neutralized, this just goes on.

Nonsense, there is very little room for you to run away from your and fakeemail’s comments.  You diminish the man without qualification.  If that is the standard of discourse, then I defy you to name just “one” President of the post WWII era who fits you definition of successful.

                                    Not at all. He didn’t accomplish a whole lot. It wasn’t his fault, absolutely, but it’s hard to argue his presidency wasn’t a lot like the hole left in a cup of water when you pull your finger out of it.
I don’t think there were any successful Presidents post WWII. Or even post WWI. In terms of salvation of the ideals of the country, I mean. At best, they fought delaying actions and lost. The only ones who moved the ball downfield were the progs.

                    An all-white polity is not the answer.
Truth.
The assumption that it’s the answer amounts to confounding the fruits of good action with good action itself. And “white” is a preposterously superficial term. It makes as much sense as saying and writing ‘albino’.
There are plenty of people of good character, intelligence, and form who are not albino. There is no such thing as the white race, and the “Dissident Right” is a ghetto for dissident conservatards who are spinning their wheels in the deep mud of the past.

                                You didn’t address my point that non-whites will not make common cause with whites.  Instead they will always see their race as distinct from the whites and look for ways to gain the upper hand.

                                    You didn’t address my point that non-whites will not make common cause with whites.I didn’t need to. It’s obvious that I, myself, do not make common cause with most “whites” just because of low melanin content of the skin. Most such people (esp. American Protestants) are devoutly loyal to evil, anyway, so I’m not losing much sleep just because existence has arranged for the disappearance of most “white” people during the next few centuries.Let the world be cleansed, and pay closer attention to what is written (e.g. ‘form’) before reacting again like a leg to a rubber mallet tapping a tendon. There’s much more to a race than skin pigmentation. For example, just the other week I encountered a young fellow whose form was excellent but whose skin was almost tawny. He wasn’t sprayed or burnt up by the Sun, either. In fact, he looked as if he’d spent most of the summer in an office, but he’d deserve to laugh in the face of any retard who called him white. If your clownishly shallow idea held merit, many people of eastern Asia (often about the same color as me) would likewise count as “white” even though we belong to different breeds of humans.

                            The USA is doomed one way or another, and she is dragging her most hardheaded loyalists with her. One day, an event horizon will be passed, or has been passed already. Then there will be no escape. Should this come to pass, demographers of the future will be correct to say ‘deserved’.

                            The problem is wrt selecting upon good character, morals, and intelligence is the unfortunate aspect of “regression” to the mean.  In short, the mean of the racial category these folk belong to, would indicate that in many cases, they are but “outliers” of their “people”.  To bring them here and to expect them to produce offspring with as high a caliber as the parents is not in the offing.For example, studies have shown that the children of Black parents in the *highest* US SES category have children whose SAT scores are lower that White children from parents in the lowest SES category.  I believe the measure was in quintiles.  Of course these are averages across all such parents.  Some children themselves will be outliers—but we don’t make societal decisions on outliers.

                                I don’t know that anyone is arguing to import foreigners of good character. Just that maybe we could find some common cause somewhere to get things prioritized.
Whatever positive might be said about Trayvon Martin’s dad, he obviously failed to get his son out of the shithole gangland his mom raised him in. Family court or whatever else one blames, failure is failure.
However, I’d like to think that his dad could at least agree that without the gangland culture, his son might still be alive, and the elimination of gangland is a priority.

                                    Prioritization I agree upon. Indeed, if presented with a choice of vetted immigration and non-vetted illegal immigration, I choose the lessor of evils. I have always done so—and rightfully been criticized regarding that position.
The original comment/response, perhaps somewhat misunderstood by me, was toward that goal, but attempted to explain why such is “an evil” nonetheless!

                        “There is no such thing as the white race,…”Yep, the uneducated keep saying that, but the science says you are wrong.  Hell, there was even a study published a few years ago using machine learning on x-ray’s and was able to distinguish between the 4 major race distinctions with close to 100% accuracy.If there is no thing as the White race, then certainly there is no such thing as the Black race, and infinitely less so for the Hispanic racial classification.  Yet they are all used and folks have little problem identifying themselves as such.  Again, studies have shown almost 100% accuracy in matching these folk on the basis of testing to their self proclaimed racial categories.

                        That may be true. No not the “no white race” thing, but the “character, intelligence, form” thing. It may also turn out that it’s just an outlier thing.
Problem, there’s not much one can do with that right now either way. If the collapse happens, we will find out whether character and environment matters or genes matter.
Knowing what I do of the North Side of Chicago when I can’t avoid doing business there, and how DC is playing out, I don’t think the smart money is on genes. Not White genes, anyway.

                “How ironic that winning the Cold War was the final inflection point in America’s demise”.I’ve mentioned this before on this site, but I posit that the US did not win the CW – the Communist did. I know there will be folks here that will argue “how can you that be when the USSR was dissolved”?   I didn’t say the USSR or Russia won the CW, but the rising communists in the US, the Anglosphere, and W Europe sure did. The early 90s was the point when the young radicals  of the 60s (and a certain demographic)began to take over the levers of power in the West and they’ve never looked back.  One could even say the communist lost the USSR and Russia, but WON the West, and it absolutely galls the leftist elite to no end that they still can’t get their claws around the Motherland again. But as we see with Ukrainian war, they will never give up trying.

                    Well, you’re absolutely correct in noting that the Left gained absolute power soon after the end of the Cold War (conservative abdication had something to do with that). You’re also right that the Leftists were 60s radicals come of age. However, these people were and are postmodern fascists, not communists in any meaningful sense. Oh sure, they’ll still prate on occasionally with their socialist cant, but in point of fact they’re quite cozy with capitalism, especially since they hijacked it.

German fascism, yes, at least rhetorically. Also , not outright ownership of the means of production, but of any who would not use their industries as the state wanted them used, e.g., Junkers. (IMO, distinction without much of a difference.) Another was such a screwy understanding of economics that it made protectionism look sensible.
Other nations’ versions of fascism (Spain, for instance) was more about the nation, not the people. And like today, fascist was also used as a synonym for “bad” or “evil”.

                        Zman or perhaps it was Severian, opined, correctly I believe, that after the Soviet Union dissolved it left the US/West with no clear “enemy.” Relevant to this discussion is that while a state of [Cold] war existed, to a large degree “The West” was united in its effort to resist the “Enemy” (primarily the Soviets). This had the salubrious benefit of keeping a lid on the Left’s worst tendencies. However, once the Great Russian Boogey Man was no more, then was lost the restraining influence and the Left could run amok.Of course there are plenty of other influences, such as the already cited importation of Marxist/Communist ideologies from Europe dating back to (at least) the 1930s if not earlier. Many of those and their descendants were highly intelligent who went into academia, business, government, etc. This was, of course the “march through the institutions,” the Cultural Marxism we sometimes hear of.It sure seems that our (“Western”) governments are going to great effort to make their own legacy (“White”) citizens the new enemy.This won’t end well.

                            The defeat of the USSR had the biggest impact on the Right in America. The Right, for around half a century, saw destroying global communism as itsraison d’etre. With that task accomplished, it had no reason to exist other than to maintain its lucrative sinecures. And it was both ill-equipped and disinclined to resist the postmodern antiwhite fascists of the New Left who had battened right under its nose. In fact, the Right went so far as to join the other side. And here we are with a Leftist uniparty blethering on inanely about Our Democracy.

            If you are straight, white and male, you have no country and no advocacy.  The time will eventually come when strong men must make great sacrifice.  In doing so, those men must be capable of sociopathy towards our enemies and show no mercy or remorse for what they must do.
if that doesn’t happen then all hope of a proper civilization will be swept into the dustbin.

                Couldn’t agree more.  I’ve been thinking about this for the past 6-7 years.  NO ONE has been willing to sacrifice anything so it’s no surprise that we find ourselves in this position.  These are the fruits of a selfish, individualistic society.  I’ll keep plugging along, living far below my means, building up my property/ skills for self-sufficiency and just waiting for the black flag to be hoisted.

                        That remains to be seen, but going into 2015 did anybody think Donald Trump would be the one ushering in a populist/nativist right movement?  All we can do is prepare ourselves for the possibility.  If the opportunity presents itself, we must be able to capitalize.

                A couple quibbles. Its not really a sacrifice to give up something you value highly for something you value even more highly. That’s just a rational choice. I get giving up your life to save your kids is called a sacrifice, but it’s not. It’s just being a dad. Anyone who would not does not deserve the title.
Second, men must be willing to engage in great violence, yes, but that is not sociopathy. It’s restoring the “proper” society. It’s the exact opposite of sociopathy.

                    That’s not the sociopathy I’m referring to.  The sociopathy comes into play when one must do what he must to his enemies, despite their cries for mercy.  None can or should be shown.

If you revel in torturing them, sure. Sick puppy. A clean kill, even if your enemy is hors de combat? A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do. A man doesn’t make someone else do what needs to be done just because he’s too weak to do it.

            “I simply cannot believe what has occurred to this nation since then.”I can.  No matter how mighty or rich a nation, it’s only a matter of time for it’s death when it sell it soul and it sells out it’s people.  When it stop believing in God.And the that is precisely what the USA has done since at least the Civil Rights coup/regime took power and replaced the constitution and heritage America.  It’s been all selling the American people (esp. the middle class) down the river and dividing them against each other economically and socially.   Once women and the “newcomers” were given moral and legal precedence it was over.   Once prayers was criminalized in public spaces it was over.   Once Americans became TV and sports zombies it was over.  Once Americans gave more respect to “credentials” then necessary hard work and character it was over.  Once Americans became porn addicts it was over.In other words, it’s been over for a long time.

                I also heard that Trump was saying stuff to Biden when the mic was turned off to distract him and throw him off. LOL. I hope he does that again. Even with that, he was still off his game in June. I hope he is closer to his 2016 form when he made Clinton become totally unglued multiple times.

Yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and call BS on that one. Like many here, I watched that debate, and there were cameras on him the entire time, usually with a split screen for viewers. If he had done that, we would have seen it, and the media would be playing the tape non-stop.
So please, don’t help the left spread their rumors.

                            …but I don’t know why the left would spread it, it makes Trump look based and hilarious.You should continue to check your assumptions. You’re assuming the left still has any sense of irony. Or, that they have any ability to consider second- or third-order consequences for their actions.All they have in mind is, “Orange Man Bad”, so anything that makes him soundbadderto them must be true. At the least, it must be repeated. It’s a basic gut reaction they are incapable of resisting.We all must give up the assumption that we are dealing with rational, reasonable people who more or less think like us, but just come to different conclusions. Those days are long past.

                    Well, as our host noted, Trump is a well known quantity now so he’s lost the element of surprise. On the other hand Kamala is so monumentally stupid she could see a train coming a mile off and not think to get off the tracks.

        I thought that Harris and the Dems would find a way to get out of this, but I was wrong. It looks like the Democrat plan to stash her away, stage-manage her appearances (that crying shop owner a few days ago), and let the media run her campaign isn’t working. The Dems seem to have forgotten that if you put up an actor as candidate, they need to be able to act. Harris couldn’t handle a 45 minute softball interview on CNN, how is she going to handle a debate with a guy who spent 2015 and 2016 hunting presidential candidates for sport?I also don’t think her messaging and strategy is working. Nobody excite wine aunts, soyboys, and black women are excited to vote for her. She hasn’t been able to make the case that she is simultaneously responsible for the great Biden admin and will fix everything wrong with the country during the great Biden admin. Everybody, even the most blinkered liberal, can see that things are not what they used to be. I know many will never vote for Trump, but at some point, a bunch of “mean tweets” don’t look so bad compared to the sight of Haitian stealing your dog and eating it alive.

        Biden has always been an idiot but even so before senility kicked inbhe could still hold a conversation even if it was full of gaffes &amp; bold faced lies that were so obvious even a small child could see right through them. Even with that he was so confidently full of shit that he maintained a steady tempo during his younger days but kamala has always been an idiot with no age excuse.The way she talks shes so awkward it’s like she can’t go five seconds without making the room freeze in shock at her uncomfortably cringe inducing social blunder it’s cringe inducing &amp; worst of all her stupid phrases &amp; that cackle of hers drips with smug condescension. She’s like a greatest hits of all the worst social traits of humanity combined into one person, she has masterful timing at behaving in the worst possible way. It’s like she’s an anti-comedian, it’s almost impressive in an inverse sense at how repulsive she is.I wonder which persona she’s going to adopt during the debates, the cackling wrench, the sacharine but well spoken victimized negro, the unconvincing ebonics laden ghetto obama black preacher rip off or Mrs boss lady prosecutor. Perhaps she’ll regale us with a compilation of all of them depending on the context of what’s being discussed.The only thing that’s certain is that her performance is going to be intellectually offensive to anyone whose IQ doesn’t double as their shoe size &amp; her grotesque phoniness will make everyone’s skin crawl reflexively in disgust.This debate is really gonna make her eventual newly crowned most popular president in US history status that much more sadistically &amp; obviously fraudulent. If you thought it was bad seeing people unflinchingly parrot that comically obvious lie for the last four years you haven’t seen nothing yet. Don’t despair though, put on the clown make up &amp; start juggling bowling pins, embrace the absurdity of it all &amp; join in on the fun. When they lie about reality it’s a painful act of self subversion even more than it is directed outward, why they het so upset when observable reality is pointed out &amp; why they want to control speech with an iron fist. They’re not even really trying to convince you but themselves.Imagine how self depreciating it must be to go around &amp; say with a straight face that george floyd was a future astronaut who was taken out in his prime because of hatred of the tone of his skin, that’s a level of internal suffering that’s hard to even grasp. If you don’t believe me look at the happiness index of leftist strongholds like Portland, we may get blackpilled but they exist in a veritable black hole of negativity.https://www.bendsource.com/news/misery-thy-name-is-portland-2133009We’re all going to be mad men by the time the next election cycle comes around so we might as well start soaking it in now. Easier said than done I know but there is a certain cosmic humor to all this. In between the inevitable bouts of rage just try to laugh at it because that’s one thing the left absolutely despises due to their seething hatred of humor, happiness &amp; all things beautiful in this world.

        The stupidity of the old elite allowing hostile foreigners to take over radio, TV and movies along with most newspapers and magazines has always meant that nothing of actual importance could ever be debated in public.  For example, instead of debating the need for continual immigration and the price to be paid for such a policy, it’s reframed as illegal vs legal immigration and how we need more PHD immigrants.  The option of a total moratorium on all immigration and repatriation of most foreigners in the country is completely off the table.Most people couldn’t care less about what is said at the debate in terms of who they will vote for.  It’s just a big propaganda event.  Anyone who is swayed by the debates shouldn’t be allowed to vote anyway.

        I think this is the right outlook and disposition. America was finished by the revolution in the 60s. The 70s, 80s and 90s presented the final chance to restore her. That would have required not Conservatism, but a ferocious counter-revolution. The Beautiful Losers were wholly incapable of that. To be fair, neither were we capable of lighting the fire to rouse them.We are in the midst of a massive demolition of the nation-state. Of course the rulers know that a nation is a people and that it is the people who construct this state on their behalf. So, destroying the people is to destroy the nation state.We have to focus on the path forward. Do we want to survive as a people? Do we want to do so in the context of a hostile and extremely powerful international ruling class? Their project doesn’t seem driven by making a plan for a better world but driven by avarice and malice. In other words, they are making the choice for those who don’t want all they love to perish forever.The ruling class was on the right track in the 20s with the immigration halt and the intentional project to forge a people through ethno and cultural genesis. We had WWII and the space program as binding projects. ButAs for practical politics what benefits us that is worth our engagement?Abolishing the Civil Rights (Anti-White) regimeMoratorium on All ImmigrationMass peaceful deportation by taking the money awayTotal overhaul of the Secret ServiceAre any of those even on the docket in a serious way? I am not so sure. I seem to recall a prayer in a Sari to the one true God of Sravahavi Guru and a DNC style parade at the RNC. It looked like Republican capitulation and a prostrate kissing of the standard to me.There are a huge number of things we can do even in the face of the controlled demolition as it proceeds. One of them is acceptance and knowing the difference between acceptance and capitulation. Acceptance frees our energy up for getting started on the cross generational project to preserve our people, preserve our heritage, and to use the building process to build the next version of our people and our future heritage.They’ve got their throat on the dying corpse and they are only squeezing harder. That isn’t to despair it is to move forward on our own and organize the hell out of ourselves. A hero’s journey for a stateless people must now begin.

        Debates are carny shows intended to keep the savages on the reservation. It provides false hope for a better future via rooting for your team. Both sides will throw snark at the other and bask in the illusion of winning. Rah Rah vote harder. No matter what, post election the doom cycle begins. Russia wins in Ukraine, Israel marches into the toilet, and the dollar begins its death spiral. Here is the hard part. The Deep State will have its back against the wall and feel compelled to unleash the invaders on a blissfully unaware sheeple. Best to stock up on ammo while its still available.

        Since then, we have had debates every cycle, but they stopped being debates in the normal sense, devolving into choregraphed media contests.Heh. You can say that again! Here’s a debate from yester-century regarding Europe, between Enoch Powell and Roy Jenkins:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlM_zFTKTC8That’s the calibre of fellows we had. I link the video not because it relates in anyway to the topic of the US “elections”, but because it yet again illustrates the wide gulf between that which was (only fifty years ago) and that which remains.Those hear need no reminders of the decline, but it’s an interesting video because of the cultural essence it captures.

        “The chaos of the last decade reflects the collapsing confidence of the ruling class”
With respect, I think it’s the exact opposite. The chaos is the result of peak hubris garnished with staggering incompetence. Other than this quibble, this was a great essay as usual.

        Signs for Harris and Harris – Walz are now sprouting like magic mushrooms amidst the North Shore plutocrats of Chicagoland, including among the compassionatekleptoparasitesofNew Trier Township. Signs for MAGA and Trump are about as numerous as “African” Americans on right wing volunteer day in a bird sanctuary—where nobody will bother you if you grind your teeth in anger about Gaia and her devotees. If you would like to see in their natural habitat some of the people who have been planning for a huge surge ofradioactive falloutin your kids’ drinking water, take a scenic drive through theNorth Shorethis fall duringpeak color.

            Wow, there isn’t one region on that map that isn’t utterly drenched in radioactive fallout, the the color doesn’t even get past the midway mark towards the lower end. If one didn’t know any better they might get the impression that the US has had a policy of maximizing dysgenic mutations in every way imaginable. That’s certainly been the outcome regardless of the intent but I almost wonder if its a subconscious desire of the people who gravitate towards positions of influence. Like how a dog doesn’t literally think to itself “it’d be very enjoyable to chase that ball that was just thrown” or a how a negro doesn’t deliberately ponder “oh look at this civilization that’s evolved beyond mud huts, I’m going to dismantle it &amp; reduce it to rubble.”It’s like that but with Americans subconsciously desiring to make the most dysgenic population to ever walk the earth. We banned eugenic policies &amp; then immediately instituted deliberately dysgenic policies that reward &amp; incentivize the most anti social &amp; civilization destroying traits through welfare programs &amp; outlawing patriarchy in favor of feminism. The defacto promotion of harems except without the any of the miniscule stability it would normally afford through having Instituted through marriage &amp; thus a provide a father figure to all the children created as a result of that policy. Send the best men to die in pointless wars, dump fluoride in the water, poison the food supply &amp; release toxic chemicals &amp; radiation everywhere. Restructure our economy to make being a degenerate one of the easiest &amp; most financially rewarding methods of participating in the economy. Elevating psychopaths to upper echelons of  both the financial &amp; social strata of society. Institutionalize industrial exposure of anti natal sexual degeneracy to children in addition to not only making an industry out of mutilating of children but upholding it as one of the moral acts one could do to their offspring.I could on &amp; on with examples, it’s like if the devil took control of society &amp; did everything in his power to make it the most anti natural law degenerative place where humans were deliberately turned into the antithesis of what healthy adaptive people should be, would he do differently? Personally I can’t think of anything.This all could just be a coincidence but I doubt it, I think we’re just in the final stages of liberalism. There’s also no reason to think liberals of the past would behave any differently if they had the technology we do today back then. Going around trying to save the most savage species of man, if you can even call bantu that, from being used for something useful in the form of farm equipment while claiming that’s morally good isn’t all that far removed from the logic being employed by today’s liberals. What we have today is the natural evolution of the ideology, it was always dysgenic supremacist in nature, the advent of the industrial revolution greatly expanded tools they could use to accomplish that goal.

                The concentration in eastern VIrginia and on the southern part of thePocomoke Peninsulais interesting, is it not? Like the State of Israel, the USA is deeply evil, and she has been all along. It’s ghoulish even to contemplate a massive, full-hemispheric nuclear war on the pretext of defending them and their alleged interests. Yet here we are because it’s what their low people prefer. Columbians are plotting the details of their biggest war ever, one against both Russia and China at the same time, and we know who controls the Congress.There’s also no reason to think liberals of the past would behave any differently if they had the technology we do today back then.Just imagine the wasteland which the Earth would have become long ago if the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Heebs had figured out subjects such as positional notation, calculus, chemistry, and electromagnetism. It’s what all American “conservatives” including people of the “Dissident Right” are striving for whether they admit it or not.Abolition needs to become a national security priority of all human nations. If nations of other animals such as the crows and the ravens would like to help, so much the better. Nations which resist belong in the landfill of history.

            Saw an honest to goodness “Harris – Walsh”  flag proudly displayed in front of a house in my leafy suburban paradise.  The house did NOT have a BLM/ “We Believe”/ or gay sex flag, which was weird.
Interesting, the Harris booster is currently outnumbered by two Trump flags adorning other houses in the area.
Give us a good rain, however, and I’m sure the Harris signs will sprout exponentially.

            That doesn’t sound good. New Trier has median income of, what, $200k? $250k? Almost negligible poverty, 85% white? Yeah, by definition that’s going to be a lot of shitlibs, but seems to me a decade or so ago it was at least competitive.

            Dunno. If $30T isn’t enough to crash it, why would $40T?
There’s still a lot of America to loot. I think they will be able to more or less keep the wheels on until they extract everyone’s equity in everything, and you really do own nothing and are happy.

        I’m debating whether or not to buy a few bundles of plywood from the lumber distributor and sell them by the sheet for 4 times what I paid for them in late October. Because I guarantee the plywood will be going up.

Why?  Wood prices have been in the decline for awhile.

        Here’s a gem from one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates:“I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the black and white races — that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making VOTERS or jurors of negroes, NOR OF QUALIFYING THEM HOLD OFFICE, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any of her man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.”Seemed like a great idea! Gee, Mr. Lincoln, what happened?

        Cripes, Trump is an unfocused debater.  I know it was 3 on 1, but he just wasn’t on top of any detail or even his zingers.  Just flailing around too much.
Not saying he lost, but not a sterling performance.

            I read that as “ZMan pees behind the curtain.” Which wouldn’t be a bad idea, come to think of it. Would be funny to see our Wizards walking out, shaking their pants legs.
