        Reading between the words. ‚ÄúWe find ourselves now at a moment where the alignment (redacted) between our three countries is stronger than it has been in decades.‚Äù And Jupiter aligned with Mars. That dog was barking 40-plus years ago when I was in college.

            Ditto.  I was an Econ major at a UC school.  Took  ‚ÄúEconomics of Energy‚Äù in the latter years of the Carter Administration.  Energy was a big deal at the time, and while I don‚Äôt recall much, I DO recall learning that we would be plum out of oil by  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
That date has come and gone, many times.

        On average a 42 gallon barrel of crude oil yields about 22 gallons of gasoline. So, what happens to the remaining 20 gallons? The other distillates are either used directly (airplane fuel, diesel, lubricants, heating oil, kerosene, etc.) or as constituents in more than 10,000 other products such as plastics, asphalt, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.
If gasoline consumption is reduced then there will either be critical shortages in all of the other products or the prices of these other products will increase. Then we would have to dispose of the excess gasoline35YT

        Solar and wind power, in my opinion, qualify as the mythical ‚ÄúFREE lUNCH‚Äù.  I was made aware of the free lunch as a very young lad, I was watching the Three Stooges.  The Stooges operated a restaurant which was losing money, Moe directed Curly to increase the price of the Free Lunch from 5 cents to 10 cents.  Problem solved.A few years back I was project manager of the construction of a wildlife center, the project was a multi-million dollar affair of which the federal taxpayer funded half.  Nearing the end of the project my client realized a sizable chunk of money earmarked for the project was unspent.  The director of the facility asked me to estimate the cost of replacing the 1200 amp 3 phase service with solar.  I knew this would not end well.  At a meeting with the director and a flock of his assistants I was told they assumed a couple thousand square feet of panels could be installed on the roof and all would be right with the world, when I delivered the bad news one of the assistants shed tears.  I told them there was no free lunch, they were shocked.  In an attempt to soften the blow and make money I suggested a geothermal system to pick-up some of the heating and cooling load, when I described the system and installation process  the director said it was too intrusive for the earth so we forgot about the whole deal and blew the rest of the loot on trinkets.  Progs are insane.

        It‚Äôs important to recognize that every single item on Ford‚Äôs list was readily achievable in 1975, but then America began electing Democrats, or more accurately Progressives. Reagan tried to revive the Nuclear industry but Democrats blocked it in Congress, at the state level, and in the NRC. Bush II actually made an admirable effort to revive the Nuclear industry but was stymied by the NRC.Progressives have been waging war on the coal industry for 40 years, with the Obama administration dealing the death blow. They will destroy the fracking industry if Republicans in Congress don‚Äôt hold the line.America could have Inexpensive, abundant, and clean power readily available today. It does not because Progressives hate Americans and want them to suffer.

            We have not built a refinery in 30+ years. There‚Äôs a new type of refinery coming on-line that takes natural gas and turns it into gasoline. Current costs result in $4 gas, but scale will drop it to $2 in a short time. The greens are against it.

        Ha, Scientific American, I call it Scientific-lite.  Heavy on progressivism.  Progressive ideas have infiltrated even the technical fields.  IEEE Spectrum used to be hard core science but now is filled with a bunch of alternative energy crap and going to Mars dreams.  Like we have the money to do that.  IF the Elites want to escape the problems of Earth to go to Mars, I say let them use their own money, not public funding.  If you want hard core engineering info you have to dig other sources to get away from all the politically correct crap.  Yes, yes, I know about all the tangential benefits to society from such an effort but we have bigger problems to deal with than finding a new habitat or playing Star Trek and ‚Äúseeking out new life where no one has gone before.‚ÄùOf course, if we had someone with guts to push an energy policy that made sense, there would be hell to pay from TPTB.  Too much money invested in the petrol based economy.I have faith in American ingenuity and believe that if we set a goal similar to the Kennedy Space program of the ‚Äô60‚Äôs to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade, we could accomplish great things.  We couldn‚Äôt do it in less than a decade, not like the triumvirate of posers on the North American corridor say, but say a 50 year plan, something significant could be done.  We would have to start with training a new generation of engineers and scientists and technicians who know real science and tackle a two pronged program of 1. weening the economy off of petrol based energy and transitioning the infrastructure as needed, and 2. developing new energy sources, or improving the ones we currently have, that will be those needed to replace the oil based.Lots of jobs, good jobs to be had throughout the economy from shovel ready to R&amp;D and business and everything in between.  Hope in the future.  A purpose that people could get behind.  And a way to definitely Make America Great Again!  Just an idea.And I haven‚Äôt even started about rebuilding America‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure.  Don‚Äôt get me going.  Obozo don‚Äôt know shit about shovel ready jobs.  All he knows is crony capitalism, wasting money on his friends and screwing Americans.

            @ LetsPlay ‚Äì Your comments are spot on, but allow me to elaborate. üôÇ Humans have understood how to create energy for thousands of years. Obviously we‚Äôve become more efficient at it in the last 200-years or so, but the real problem isn‚Äôt creating energy, its how to store it. That is the real challenge.Predicting power needs and power generation technology is always a tricky even by the most optimistic engineering teams and futurists. It is one of the great crystal balls of our day that remains cloudy and unseeable due to the limits of current engineering and material science, environmentalist concerns, corporate influence, the cost to the consumer cost, geo-political instability and of course resource allocation throughout the globe.Gen-IV reactors propose some interesting new technologies. Even when avoiding the use of water in favor of molten lead or molten salt coolant systems, the nuclear material is still the big problem. Efficiently and safety can be improved, but someone still has to manage the removal, transport and disposal of nuclear material. While interesting theoretically, Gen-IV reactors are still at an early stage of development and will probably not be available commercially for two or three decades.Oil is going away. Period. That is a fundamental fact of a finite, non renewable resource. Exactly when peak oil will hit is still up for debate, but the fact remains it will someday be gone. Coal, while plentiful here in Europe, is also a finite resource so it‚Äôs days are limited just like oil.Net-generation from renewable energy sources in the German electricity sector has increased from 6.3% in 2000 to about 30% in 2014. In Denmark, more than 40% of their energy supply now comes from wind power and the plan is to reach 50% by 2020.In Sweden, forest residue is the leading bioenergy source and bioenergy is the nation‚Äôs leading energy source. Since the 1970s when 70-80% of Sweden‚Äôs energy mix came from imported oil, the country has transformed its energy system to the point where oil is almost entirely a transport fuel, while bioenergy is used in district heating, industry and electricity production.Solar panels are generally limited to rectangular panels. They are bulky, heavy, not very adaptive to modern architecture and require a lot of land for solar farms. A number of companies are already working on ‚ÄòPV roof tiles‚Äù to replace our current European ceramic roof tiles(1), which are the dominant roofing material across all of Europe.Then there‚Äôs geothermal. The first geothermal power plant in Germany (2) started operation in Waren an der M√ºritz in 1984 and is still providing heat for 1,800 households today, three decades later. While not currently as popular as wind and solar, a rise in the use of hydro-geothermal energy is expected by 2030.LetsPlay ‚Äì You are absolutely correct that America, and Europe, stand to gain a massive boost to their respective economies and job outlooks in the future of advances in energy technology.(1)http://www.noventec.de/produkte/solarthermie/solardachziegel-stein-rotivaplus.html(2)http://www.stadtwerke-waren.de/03,02,01.html

                Karl, your routine keeps getting funnier all the time! (And I know, for a German, that‚Äôs really hard!)This time, its :  ‚ÄúOil is going away. Period.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs such a hoot, I cannot contain my mirth. People have been  saying that for almost a century now and the world‚Äôs awash in more petro products than ever before.  Oklahoma‚Äôs latest discovery, the Woolford Shale beneath that state‚Äôs historic heavy oil producers, appears to be as prolific as the Bakken field in No Dakota. And oddly, what were once considered as depleted Saudi fields, are now apparently re-filling from an unknown source.Peak Oil is a myth. Oil will never go away.  Not when they keep finding it in the most unusual places. Often  almost by accident!  Just wait until they start really looking for it!

                    Forever is a long time. I‚Äôve read estimates of enough oil for 500 years. It‚Äôs inexpensive, it‚Äôs incredibly abundant and will therefore be produced by capitalists and consumed by ordinary people until either it runs out or something less expensive and just as abundant  comes along. If if does start to run out, we‚Äôll figure out how to produce energy. We‚Äôre humans. We do foolish things, but we‚Äôre not stupid. It‚Äôs amazing what we can do when we have to. Peak oil and alternative energy are cons, like global warming, run by the Cult to control our lives and take our money and property.

                        True ‚Äì it could be 5, 50 or 500-years. But the fact is it‚Äôs all a big guess and no ones knows for sure. And as it becomes more difficult to obtain, it will get more expensive. Basic supply and demand cost model. But alternative energy is really about contingency planning and creating a sustainable future ‚Äì and not just for energy, but for all sectors. Science and engineering working to solve problems we will have in the future ‚Äì and there will be problems.

        We like to use this graph in arguments like this. It‚Äôs from the Bonneville Power Administration, and it breaks down power generated by source. Usually solar and wind power are minimal:http://transmission.bpa.gov/business/operations/wind/baltwg.aspxI read an article by Steven Den Beste back around 2000, where he explained why alternates like wind and solar can‚Äôt be scaled up to replace conventional power sources. It was the first time I‚Äôd seen it explained so clearly and it made a lot of sense to me. I like to tell those that think solar is a good option to start using solar to replace the power in just one room. I‚Äôve read about people doing that and it seems to me to be a good way to start if you really believe it will work for you.As for me, I‚Äôve lived at least ten years without electricity during my lifetime. Electricity really does free up time to do other things. It is a lot of work to preserve food without electricity, wash clothes, light the house, etc. if you do not have electricity. I really can‚Äôt understand those that think we can do without it.

            When the Greens attack Air Conditioning, then I really know they have lost it.  Rather than question the current design methodology and look for better alternatives, no, they want to do away with it completely because it is bad for the environment.  Never mind what a boon it has been for human kind quality of life and general productivity.  The loons are one-trick ponies who want to go back to the stone age.

        Problem with most of the green types and their Progressive hangers on is that none are ‚Äúsystem‚Äù thinkers.  They develop a fetish for solar, or wind or ________ and then everything is about promoting their particular fetish.  Ask a solar fetishist how you manage base and surge loads and you either get a blank stare or a chipper ‚Äúbattery storage!‚Äù.  If the latter, ask a follow up on energy density and cost of current storage options, the economic chain of lithium supply and they usually go blank again.  That‚Äôs how Germany ended up re-opening lignite pits to feed coal/steam plants to cover for over reliance on unreliable renewables.  Similar fetish for the anti-frackers that come to my door asking for money in NY.  Explain to them that the only reason the US, non-signatory to the Kyoto Treaty actually did better on CO2 emissions than the signers was because we fracked natural gas and substituted it for coal at a lower price (once cap cost for the plants figures in) and it emits half the CO2 per BTU.  They cannot get their minds around that‚Ä¶.and so it goes.

            There‚Äôs an old gag in engineering where the process is meticulously diagrammed and one critical box is labeled ‚Äúsomething magical happens.‚Äù That‚Äôs always been the problem with alternative energy. Electric cars sound like a great idea until you realize it means replacing the entire electric grid. As a rich man‚Äôs toy, they are great, but rich man toys seldom scale up.As an aside, I used to have fun telling greens that too many solar panels would result in darkness 24 hours a day because all the sunlight would be sucked into the panels. You would be surprised by how many fell for it.

                That is fucking funny.  Have to try it out.  The grid issue is real.  Was with a bunch of utility engineers a couple years ago and they showed us the calcs on what would happen if 10% of the vehicles in the average older suburban neighborhood went fully electric.  Basically ‚Äúreplace and/or upgrade the entire grid‚Äù.  Oops.

        If you don‚Äôt already follow the business news on the energy sector already, you should know that there have been a wave of bankruptcies by the biggest of the solar power manufacturers this year and going back three years at least.  In addition, Germany‚Äôs plans to shut down all of its nuclear power plants has resulted in large ripple effects through the nation‚Äôs nergy sector with the serious prospect of the largest ever bankruptcy in Germany‚Äôs history (http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/06/green-energy-could-cause-the-largest-bankruptcy-in-german-history/).  About the only sector seeing growth (and that growth almost solely due to large government direct subsidies) is the offshore wind sector, which is now the new focus of the green‚Äôs energy policy for coastal states.

            At least the Don had a real steed, lance and windmill to tilt at.  Green energy is mostly a mist of promises and dreams.  The one area I see tremendous strides in is battery technology.  Some really good stuff coming from that area.

        Ah, the electric car. I still remember reading the science magazines in the 80‚Äôs as teenager. It‚Äôs right around the corner if we could just get these darn battery things to last. The only thing that become better about electric vehicles is the comfort level, but the battery charging and range still stinks. Yet, we are forced to subsidize a billionaire‚Äôs fantasy science project.

        Yes, but‚Ä¶ these repeat messages are like that old pop song you once liked on the radio (though admittedly hearing it a lot got to make it irritating) so these ‚Äònew‚Äô initiatives and statements are like a breath of fresh air. You can enjoy them all over again. Recycling never goes away.
Sure, they still are inherently irritating but its fun seeing how they demonstrate that human beings never change. Same old, new old, you could say.

            Well, the fact is that many ‚Äúdepleted‚Äù oil and gas wells are still producing many many years after they should have hit empty.True, they produce at reduced outputs relative to their prime years, but they nevertheless still produce and no one really knows why this is.The generally accepted view of oil/gas formation ‚Äì the biotic theory of oil formation ‚Äì  is that they are the byproducts of decomposed vegetation, which after millions and millions of years now ‚Äúreside‚Äù thousands of feet under the present day surface, and merely await its discovery and extraction.This theory clearly implies that the reserves of oil and gas are finite (of course, Hubbert‚Äôs Peak Oil Theory is most commonly quoted by the greenies, despite the fact Hubbert developed his theory in the late 1950s when the methods of oil/gas discovery and extraction were, compared to present day technology, ancient, Nevertheless, Hubbert laid out his theory and somehow neglected to consider that ALL technology evolves and improves over time.)A different theory, and accepted by very few experts ‚Äì the abiotic theory of oil formation ‚Äì posits that natural elements within the earth (non biological in origin) such as CO2 and hydrogen combine to produce methane (a hydrocarbon).If this latter theory is true, and yes this would be a really, really big if, then the supply of hydrocarbons is essentially unlimited and could explain some of the still-producing depleted wells that forgot they were empty.

                I don‚Äôt know how few is very few, but the Russian got it right. When a thing becomes valuable we assume it is rare, but the universe is littered with nothing so much as hydrocarbons such as great columns of gas clouds. Coal is a fossil fuel. Some gas is, oil never. Scientist are cunts like everybody else depending on government for funding.

            My understanding is that up until recently, US/Canadian wells were too expensive to operate once they got to about 70% so there was a lot of oil left in the ground. The cost to get it was the issue. New technology now makes it possible to get the oil out at cheaper prices. People tell me that the US/Canadian drillers can quickly restart as well, thanks to modern technology. That means when oil prices rise, the US/Canadian wells can quickly come back on line. The result is a cap of sorts on the global rice of oil.The fact is, fossil fuels are great and they are getting cheaper, relative to other goods. Peak oil was complete nonsense.
