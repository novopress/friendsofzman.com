        One quibble with your post is that I think you’re underestimating the population of El Norte.  LA county alone is 10 million people.  There’s at least 3 million a piece in Orange, San Diego, and Maricopa (Phoenix) counties, plus about 2 million each in San Bernardino, Riverside, and Clark (Las Vegas).  That’s 25 million people before you even get into Texas.
