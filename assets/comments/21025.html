        We‚Äôre getting more evidence that the truth doesn‚Äôt matter to our enemies now that the body cam footage of the George Floyd arrest has been released.  I keep thinking of the smoldering ruins of Minneapolis this morning and all of the tributes to Floyd, the chanting of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe,‚Äù and all the rest of it based on lies about Floyd and lies about police hunting down blacks. The lies about all of this will continue.

            The mantra for a while to the rumors of Floyd has been ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean he deserved to die‚Äù.  They just have no amplified it x100 because it‚Äôs literally the only thing they can say now that his criminal record and insane antics with the cops is now known.For those who think sanity will prevail, remember most people still think Rodney King was beaten for no other reason than being black.There‚Äôs a good chance those cops will get acquitted.  The only reason they may not is the jurors are either diverse, or terrified of retaliation and riots.

                        Barr may be the swampiest of swamp creatures.

It‚Äôs sad watching the commenters at Breitbart and the Conservative Treehouse cling to the hope that Barr and Durham are going to indict and arrest their fellow swamp creatures for the October Surprise.

                                It is a bit off topic, but I think that the pandemic will give us an October surprise this year. To the extent that there will be a rebound in cases, my calculations show that it will really hit about the first week of October. After the beginning of school.  it is certain that the media will make much of whatever cases there are.

                                    There was not really much of a rebound here during the reopening, only a ramp up in testing, which cooked the stat‚Äôs.  Deaths rates and average age of those infected continues to decline.  The stat‚Äôs are good when one considers that there simply is no cure for the disease other than to get it and get over it.
As a budding epidemiologist, perhaps you could elaborate on your calculations?  IIRC we were to have several hundred thousand deaths at your last prediction a couple months or so ago.

                                        I should have retracted my earlier comment üôÇ I‚Äôm only back here to add a postscript. I read that several deep south states have already opened public schools. I was unaware that any States opened so early.Your sarcasm is well placed üòÄ I was one of those early on who did some quick calculations using the early models and figured we‚Äôd be up to the millions of (USA) deaths by now. I‚Äôm glad things aren‚Äôt quite so bad.I hope that many of the ultra pessimistic opinions on the political and other futures of our country will prove to be equally erroneous.Nevertheless I stand by my claim that the school re-openings are going to act as a major spreader of the virus. Even a small public school must have several hundred students. If the videos I saw today are any indication, there will be no distancing or mask wearing. Since you‚Äôve revealed me as the epidemiological fraud that I am üôÇ I make no claim beyond the obvious, that public schools are excellent Petri dishes.I agree that the virus is soemthing we will have to learn to live with ‚Äî unless we‚Äôre one of the tiny fraction who succumbs üôÅ

                That line is ridiculous.  Everyone loves to pretend that dying is related to the initial thing that caused the contact. It‚Äôs like how they lie about a guy being executed for selling cigarettes or parking in a handicapped space.  This is a denial of linear time and cause and effect.  Nobody in history has ever been executed by the state for selling cigarettes or passing counterfeit money and DUI (in the US) as in the Floyd case.This is why there should be absolutely zero support when people argue with the cops. There are only 2 possible outcomes when fighting with the police. The first one is you get away, at least in the moment. The other is you are dead or subdued. Once the incident starts the initial cause of contact is really only incidental.  Police are specifically trained to continue to increase force. It starts with presentation of uniform and some nice sounding talk. It escalates from there to verbal commands.I have watched hundreds and hundreds of these incidents (not all ending in death) and just about every single one them could have been avoided.These people just have no idea about the escalation of force and how they are directly the cause for it. None of these anti-cop fools ever think of what a world where the average criminal gets to decide whether or not he has done something wrong and whether or not he should show his license or whatever the cause may be would even look like.If you have kids, teach them not to fight with the cops. Don‚Äôt believe the hype, they will shoot your kid even faster than they will shoot a black kid. Do some role playing with them. Teach them to assert their rights without coming across like an idiot and getting shot.  The agents of the state are not your friends and they are not you kid‚Äôs friends. That is the unfortunate reality.

                    It‚Äôs equally important to point out that the Agents of the state or not your enemies, at least not at first. Just the same, it‚Äôs probably unwise to tell them more than your name, to show them your license your registration and your auto insurance. If they ask you any other questions you should probably just smile and remain silent.

                        I agree that they are not enemies, at least not by default.  But it is amazing to me to watch people, normal white people arguing with cops and prolonging the contact by arguing. Prolonging a contact with the police can only go against you. The longer they are in contact with you, the more intelligence they can gather or worse, develop probable cause for a search.I saw a video on YT where the cop tells the guy ‚ÄúOK, you‚Äôre free to go‚Äù and then started asking him a bunch of questions about a supposed business the guy had and how he could get into it.  The guy took it as friendly and kept talking to the cop. He got the guy to talk enough for the cop to develop probable cause for a search and ultimately took him to jail for drugs. This all happened after he told him he was free to go and no longer being detained.

        Maybe an unpopular position, maybe not unpopular here idk, but I think it goes back to masculine/feminine. We have this notion that force is always bad, always destructive. It can be healthy.

When I was a kid getting out of line, my parents would reason with me. If that didn‚Äôt work I‚Äôd get spanked. The spanking wasn‚Äôt abuse and wasn‚Äôt intended to harm me. It was a clear and irrefutable message that enough was enough.  Otherwise I could‚Äôve gone crazy and no reasoned argument could stop me.

            There are no boundaries set anymore.  My parents were the same.  Spankings and punishments were rare, but ruthlessly enforced.  Ditto with my own kids.  Throw a fit in the grocery store or a restaurant?‚Äîpicked them up and left.  Were not big on corporal punishment, but when we used it made sure the ‚Äúritual‚Äù was something they would not forget.  And it worked.

                The part of the ‚Äòritual‚Äô my older son absolutelyhatedwas the last one.  We‚Äôd hug, and he‚Äôd cry, and we‚Äôd talk about what he did wrong and why I punished him.  But for him to apologize at the end ‚Äì like pulling teeth.  Highly indicative of his personality, I would say.

        Our culture and politics rest on the foundations beneath them. Those foundations are our truths, values, and morals. In the 50‚Äôs all those became relative and flexible‚Ä¶ and when that happened, all kinds of uncivil behaviour was available for political warfare. Any dirty pool goes to accomplish your aims or demonize your opponents.As you‚Äôve said, you can‚Äôt run a country like that. Conservative Inc now has the dissident right to contend with, and the Donks are tearing themselves apart as the corroded guard tries to control the new vibrant lunatics. You can‚Äôt run a party, or a family like that.The coming civil war will be about resetting our shared morals, ethics, and boundaries.

        Even accounting for the fact that objectivity must yield to partisanship, there should be some truth content to the partisan rhetoric.I see a good example of this ‚Äòtruth based‚Äô partisanship in the working environment. Two technologies are put forward as some sort of solution, each with it‚Äôs own merits. The opposing parties in most cases do have a list of the tech‚Äôs strong points and argue for it to such an extent, it becomes partisanship. This is fine, because neither is completely delusional and both have a grounding in reality.How can a sober minded person look on when some middle class white girl cries oppression in countries that have provided the easiest life that has ever been known?When younger, I always used to think that the truth would win out. But it doesn‚Äôt. The truth is for the elites and a handful of lower-downs and plebs who are clued up, but for the large mass of people it doesn‚Äôt matter. Take TV, for example: the stuff on it is so obviously garbage and at odds with reality, yet if you point this out to most they think you‚Äôre the mad one. Yes indeed, truth cannot be handled by many people.

        Maybe there is some other reason for the dominance of simpletons in our politics.
The simplest explanation is that intelligent people are avoiding politics. Everyone on this comments section is intelligent, and would any here become a politician? Think of all the degrading stuff you have to do. No thanks. Intelligence is voting with feet, and those feet are going into tech, medicine, business, anything other than politics (or journalism). Eventually politics will just become too stupid for everyone to take seriously, and alternate power-centers will emerge, as Z predicts.

            National politics is theater.  Its point is to pacify the masses into believing they actually have a say in governance.  Real power is  upstream of politics.  E.g., In 2016 both parties had bringing back Glass-Steagall in their platforms.  Instead we end up with BlackRock with no congressional oversight or accountability.

                The story I always bring up was that of a local idiotic, corrupt mayor who somehow still found a way to get elected every time.  His secret: direct mailing to seniors talking about how much he cared about them; didn‚Äôt matter that he was bankrupting the town.  White town/white mayor btw.

                        Before we think about alternatives, we should acknowledge that whites are being destroyed by the sort of corporate state imagined by fascist theorists. That strikes me a necessary first step in contemplating alternatives to what is on offer. Given that the people in charge say the alternative to their preferred option is fascism, when their system is more fascistic than the supposedly fascistic system, sounds a lot like the sort of sandwich many here talk about a lot.

                            Fascism is a system that promotes the in group and suppresses the out group.   Who is in and out is driven by the culture of the country that adopts fascism.
So what you‚Äôre saying is that whites have become the out group in America.  Which is not quite true.  It‚Äôs more accurate that ‚Äúgood-whites‚Äù are the in group and that ‚Äúbad-whites‚Äù the out group.  With POCs somewhere between props and allies for the ‚Äúgood-whites‚Äù existential struggle against ‚Äúbad-whites‚Äù.  But the thing is that good whites need bad whites to exist.

Indeed. Gather up the dregs of the earth, and turn them into a militant voting block. Then make damn sure the majority is so demoralised they can‚Äôt figure out how to defend themselves.

                                                        It actually is a created majority. In the West, and this is a Western phenomenon, this required Open Borders to overwhelm the former majority. I had previously thought of it as ‚Äúleft-wing bean counters‚Äù but Spandrell really tied it together in a convincing way. It explains why trannies became a thing out of the blue‚Äìto get the numbers up, members had to be manufactured. It is why pedophilia is being mainstreamed. The bodies are needed. Spandrell suggests other mental illnesses will be elevated as needed to add to the coalition.

                                                Here is a link to an interview with the guy credited for the formulation of Bioleninism as a concept that explains today‚Äôs triumphant Left. He makes incredible sense:https://parallaxoptics.com/2018/12/11/on-bioleninism/Spandrell does address some obvious long-term problems with this type of coalition. Once the Left achieves total control, and it is close, the inherent hostilities among the groups cobbled together will surface. Among them are the left-wing Whites, who do hold the actual power, may not be able to keep it. Natural enemies such as Muslims and homosexuals will war with one another. But Spandrell proposes this ruling bloc can continue quite a while before this occurs.I don‚Äôt know that I completely agree with the previous last full sentence. It seems much of what is playing out in the streets is a battle between rising racial minorities and garden-variety upper middle class Whites who hold the actual power. In politics, AOC‚Äôs are replacing Crowleys. Battles between Hispanics and blacks are allowed to play out without intervention.White women are being cut loose from the coalition and as is their wont, they are trying furiously to hold on and becoming psychotic shipwrecks.And so on.Still, it is a damned fine explanation and it mostly holds up whatever few criticisms I have of it.

                                I reject the Derbsian notion that our current troubles are a civil war between whites. Now that may have indeed been the case 50 years ago, but blacks, through dint of fanaticism and the willingness to use violence, have gotten out front of Leftism and now call the tune. And blacks, with invaluable intellectual support from white race traitors, have declared whites, tout court, the out group. If the race traitors believe they are still in control of their movement, they will soon be painfully disabused of that notion.

                                        Yes. However, most of the serious violence and destruction has been authored by blacks. Regardless, there is symbiosis between the race traitors and the Hutus. Neither can be effective without the other. If we can drive a wedge between the two, and I believe that can be done, the Left will be crippled.

                            Fascism means solely ‚Äúanti-communist‚Äù and nothing more.  The following are historically ‚Äúliteral fascists‚Äù: monarchist Carlists and White Russians, nationalist democratic socialists like YKW, nationalist populist military dictatorships (pinochet), christian traditionalist autarkists (falange),  imperialist corporatacracies (Mussolini fascism),and dynastic empires (Japan).  The only shared characteristics are authoritarian strong central power (ie, the natural reaction to marxist revolution) and being anti-communist. Otherwise, the term is so overbroad as to be meaningless.

                            Z Man said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Given that the people in charge say the alternative to their preferred option is fascism, when their system is more fascistic than the supposedly fascistic system, sounds a lot like the sort of sandwich many here talk about a lot.‚ÄùDespite what we all think, humans don‚Äôt have an endless number of behaviors in their genetic repertoire. And there‚Äôs only so many ways to build and run a railroad; all of which have ultimately failed. Why? Because crap works until it doesn‚Äôt. So if it‚Äôs not broke, don‚Äôt fix it. In the meantime, Western Civilization ain‚Äôt actually going anywhere. White Anglo-European Civilization has permeated every nook and cranny of planet earth. The melanin enriched will never be free of our white asses, we‚Äôre forever. Think about it. Everything you see happening in the western world today, is just another phase of the same old liberal enlightenment BS. Those freaks out there are trying to demolish White Civilization, with the ideologies and politics invented by White people. How crazy is that. Anyway, things aren‚Äôt getting better any time soon. So remember:

                            I wonder if what we‚Äôre seeing in the recent chaos here is simply the attempt, by the global corporate elite, to extend the kind of corporate feudalism that they often rely on in the third world to the US.Large corporations have long taken advantage of weak nation states with little national unity.  They will buy off the local power elite and in some cases they will simply bring their own little armies of mercenaries to keep the kind of order favorable to them.  I know from personal experience that part of ‚Äúsupply chain‚Äù training in big companies includes things like how to transport weapons across international borders.This might explain things like the defund the police initiatives that the big companies, while not openly supporting, have also not opposed and in fact tacitly support with their #BLM virtue signalling.  The hysterical response to Beer Flu and all the other indications that the US is ungovernable may simply have convinced the corporatists that it‚Äôs time to move the ‚Äúsocial bond rating‚Äù of the US from ‚Äúshaky‚Äù to ‚Äújunk‚Äù and treat it accordingly.  It may be that we are not becoming Communist Russia or Nazi Germany so much as a continent scale Honduras.If this is correct it may be that the seeming globalist support for things like BLM and Antifa does not so much mean that they believe in Negro Communism as that they cynically support anything that further weakens the national state and national unity.

                            I think you are letting the theoretical tail wag the pooch here, but I will say that the sort of left-capitalism we‚Äôve seen for decades was according to some theorists an impossibility.
So maybe a ‚Äòmulticultural fascism‚Äô is something new under the sun. It‚Äôs worth thinking about.

                            I recommend you read Gottfried‚Äôs ‚ÄúFascism:  Career of a Concept‚Äù.  Autarky and subordination of private, including corporate, interests to those of the state would seem to be the fundamental components of a fascist political system.  Instead of being subordinate to USG, globalist corps are either calling the shots or in a symbiotic relationship. I think you are mistaking a few surface similarities between the methods used by the ignorant SJW bigots and blacks weaponized by globalist corporations and their parasitic institutions to advance their interests.  I find it difficult to not see globalist neoliberalim as the antithesis of fascism.

                                    I‚Äôm okay with disaggregation. I think in such a world, the tribal lines become clear. Having some source of power hold these disparate parts together, either with ideology as we see today or raw force, is a bad outcome for whites. America, post empire, looks like early medieval Spain or France.

                                        Since both of those were World Empires, might looking at the post empire history of those countries be more relevant? ¬†Or the UK? Since it has much more in common legally and socially with the USA, and also was much more recently divested of Empire.

                                            UK up until recently never ditched the idea of nationhood as enthusiastically as the US. America became an empire before finishing the work of nation building. That‚Äôs going to make for a rough ride.

                                            @Ben ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt at the time. In Spain, the local Roman Spaniards kept doing things like they had been, while the Visigoths took over the local power centers. They became the counts, etc, while maintaining a theoretical relationship with Rome (by which I mean Constantinople).
While they had a monarchy, it was mostly the local bosses who chose someone to manage the bigger institution. It was hereditary only theoretically, as I think only one or two times was a grandson of a king also a king.

                                        Ideology in the old sense is religion. I think the attempt has been to hold the county together with economics. Not the easiest argument to make, but our constitution is a written contract, there‚Äôs patent law in it, etc. The country came apart over an economic dispute. America is a commercial empire, and so on.
No time to be exhaustive, but if you squint hard enough maybe you can see what I‚Äôm saying?

            Lincoln was not fascistly holding together a nation-state‚Ä¶he was stubborn and misguided and the USA was never a nation-state. Prior to the 1960s, we have probably been more like Great Britain or Switzerland in that we are a loose collection of regions with a common heritage.I have a hard time seeing America as fascist. You could argue that the ubiquitous American flag and the military fetishism is fascism, but that‚Äôs dying out. The two-party system is not fascist. And the official civic nationalism or passport-Americanism of the past half-century is more egalitarian communist than fascist.Corporate fascism though‚Ä¶that is a thing in America, and it‚Äôs brutal, oppressive, and ugly.

                Lincoln‚Äôs actions were exactly what Mussolini would have approved of. Corporate sponsors, central authority wielded in support of a nationalist vision, abrogation of rights of assembly &amp; speech, use of violence to achieve control, little or no interference with business activity, greasing the wheels of industry to promote expansion and military power, promotion of propaganda in support of the Leader. Heck, Lincoln even wanted to deport non-whites. Am I missing anything?

                    From that list yeah, you could say he was fascist. But perhaps a paper fascist; isn‚Äôt fascism also 50% style and panache? From what I gather Lincoln didn‚Äôt do the Dear Leader bit, and I can‚Äôt imagine a frontier man of mid-19th century America ever thinking highly of authoritarianism. Gore Vidal did write that Lincoln started us on the road to American empire, though. So while ‚Äúfascism‚Äù is a popular word nowadays, I think the more apt term is ‚Äútyranny‚Äù in the Jeffersonian sense. As for the non-whites, I don‚Äôt think Lincoln was doing a service for the ethnostate. If it were 1905 instead of 1865, he‚Äôd probably have wanted the Italians gone too.

                How does the two-party system not facilitate fascism? America is definitely a corporate fascist country. I.e., oligarch ruled with large body of desperate, mal-educated peasants. Peasants that turn on each other to fight for the scraps. This is the fruit of the Libertarian tree: Corporatism.

        As a conflict becomes more and more heated language and characterizations become inflamed. The loss of a more careful assessment may be part of that‚Ä¶ but these harsh words serve a more important purpose: to define a group and to build its cohesion in preparation for a needed action.When conflicts begin to approach inevitable widespread violence no side can afford a gray area where adherents may waffle on commitments and actions.¬†Every deadly conflict has always relied on ‚ÄúGod is on our side vs the enemy is the spawn of Satan‚Äù. Our age is no different. Inflamed language serves the cohesion of a group facing serious conflict.¬†If you‚Äôre going to win you will have to commit horrors‚Ä¶so the enemy must be dehumanized.¬†You get absolved before the act is committed. You are because of this less likely to have moral qualms when expected to burn someone‚Äôs home, bomb their village or bury an axe in their skull.On the far side of most conflicts this gets attenuated.¬†Some can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt turn it down but most will. Things planned before or early in the conflict get reexamined and reordered once they begin to rebuild. And this process continues.Anti fascism and national bolshevism are simply rallying cries. Conflicts by their nature have their own organizational requirements, a pooling of group resources and actions. Chasing after individual bliss and reasonableness would weaken and destroy a group‚Äôs cohesion in a time of strife.Being rational as we draw towards a conflict is doing whatever you need to do to bring your side together and harden everyone‚Äôs resolve in defeat of an enemy.¬†Language and militancy in characterizations have always been a part of that. Our enemies are doing this full out while we have internal debates about point A versus point B versus point C‚Ä¶

        Z, thanks for bringing up the political-economy angle. It‚Äôs hilariously ironic that these anti-facist dolts can‚Äôt see that we‚Äôre moving to exactly the kind economic system that existed under the Nazi. The Nazi and big German business were tight.Leading German businesses supported the Nazi in exchange for govt contracts, subsidies, suppression of labor movement and the promotion of cartels and monopolies. It was very much a symbiotic relationship but at the expense of workers and small businesses.The same thing is happening now. Big corporations (especially tech) now support the Dems/Progressives in exchange for free reign to maintain and expand their monopolies or oligopolies. Heck, the corporations are actually acting as the hammer to destroy enemies of the Progressive state. No need for the Gestapo.The Progressive don‚Äôt want to a communist state with no private property and centralized planning. They like nice stuff. They want a fascist state with party members and big business secure in their position, scratching each other‚Äôs back, getting rich and crushing dissidents.

                My issue isn‚Äôt necessarily with the Nazi economic system. I‚Äôm fine with that system if it promotes the interests of my people.
My point was simply that it‚Äôs funny that these anti-fascists are, in fact, following the fascist playbook. It‚Äôs also funny to me that CivNat types keep calling them socialists or communists when they are fascists.
Also, the burgeoning fascist system in this country is most definitely not designed to support our people.

            I‚Äôd argue ‚ÄúCommunist‚Äù China is closer to the NDSAP model than it is to any sort of ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù.  Deng was no fool.  After his exile, he was a keen observer on his trips outside China.  And the Chinese took to heart the lessons of Korea (and to some extent in the abortive Sino-Vietnam border war) to shy away from the physical expansion that doomed Germany.  Trump in his inelegant Queens manner was the first to call them on it.

                Thus is one of those true thinks that never gets mentions. Marxism with Chinese characteristics is essentially national socialism. Lower case is important here. If you want to imagine what would have happened to fascism in Europe if there had been no way, there is a lot to learn from China. Not a perfect analogy, for sure, but a reasonable test case.

                    I always understood Marxism and Communism as internationalist and a rejection of borders and individual countries.  Yet here comes the CCP and China with a ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù system designed to benefit the Han and to expand Chinese territorial borders.  It doesn‚Äôt compute as communist in the traditional communist-fascist spectrum, but since the ‚ÄúF‚Äù word is verboten, and communism is fashionable, ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù it is.

                    Another example of national socialism would be  any country in scandinavia before the invasion began. They have socialists policies that people love across the board. Good education, great health care, lots of vacation time, paid leave,etc etc. The American idea that you can‚Äôt take care of your own people by providing them with an economic safety net is why whites in America still worship the individual and classic liberalism and find themselves in a very precarious position against people that see themselves as a group. Germans have a pretty good life, and although you can‚Äôt even whisper about national socialism there, the economy in many respects still functions that way.  Even the health care system in England was socialist and functioned incredibly well until demographic change set in, now its not so good.

            Yeah, gayest fascism ever.It turns out the communists didn‚Äôt have any interest in economics but only in promoting debauchery, while the fascists had no interest so social cohesion, but only extracting a couple nickels from every transaction.  It‚Äôs like the ideologies of the past stripped to their most simple, retarded form and melded together.

        Borrowing and adding to one of your earlier observations, explained this to one of my kids as a Cargo Cult merged with substitution economics.  Bereft of new ideas or true enemies, everyone repeats the old rituals.  Where a true Nazi would have been the Kobe beef of the 30s, the modern ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù posited by the Left is day old road kill possum.  But on the theme of pervasive mediocrity (or worse) the bounty of modern society permits those who would have perished in an earlier age or lived a marginal existence to thrive and multiply.  Toss in modern communications and these same misfits can be heard well beyond the hobo camp or insane asylum they would have been consigned to in the past.

            The more I read of Ed Dutton‚Äôs book, the more I am convinced we are being destroyed by spiteful mutations.  Whereas a century ago people like Emma Goldman were in asylums, or deported, or killed, now they run multinational corporations and European countries‚Äô armed forces.  Call it what you like, crabs in a bucket or deleterious mutations, but overall people are insanely stupid and weak and lazy.  The small remnant who aren‚Äôt need to build a community and survive the conflagration that the rest will cause and then perish in.

        Truth is the accurate perception or conception of reality, plain and simple. Lies are false representations of reality. Once upon a time, our environment required us to be realists or die, ending one‚Äôs gene line. Now we live in an environment that rewards lies as opposed to penalizing them. The environment is broken, and we (as a species) are becoming increasingly broken. That is the root of the problem. Until that is fixed, the problem will only get worse.

                Sorry, no sale. That nonsense came out of your head, not mine. You can attack a problem at it‚Äôs root (which I recommend), or you can try to mitigate the symptoms (which typically amounts to short-term pain relief and nothing approaching an actual cure). And yes, attacking a problem at it‚Äôs root is harder and often times demands more intelligence and seriousness. The latter is not a weakness. And last, the goal is education, not persuasion.

Well you just care about diversity because its our strength and without more Gautamalan and Nigerian workers the chinese will outsmart and out hustle us.

And that makes it easier for everyone concerned to pursue their true objectives.

        As much as I dislike Spengler I‚Äôll give him credit when he was referring to western world stagnating &amp; begining to regress into something similar to middle east.When a society is dying jews are there waiting to open the doors for the invaders to come. This is what happened in babylon, this is what is happening in the west today with the migration crisis.

        Z has done past podcasts on fascism and ‚Äúfringe‚Äù politics including Third Position (the larger political philosophy of which fascism is a member).  He knows that he‚Äôs doing a Ben Shapiro/Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza job on fascism here.TRS regularly hosts people like Keith Woods (Z quote ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that guy?‚Äù):https://www.bitchute.com/channel/m3lnZ8lWagkf/and Normapollohttps://www.bitchute.com/channel/qoZM0XlcYlvq/who explain Third Position in general and fascism in particular in great depth and detail. (Spoiler:  integral societies, hierarchy, racial/ethnic cohesion, law &amp; order, personal development and purpose without toxic narcissism).More high-level politics gets discussed on TRS than what I heard in poli-sci classes.Don‚Äôt just settle for the ooga-booga straw-manning.  Listen to TRS and make up your own mind.Calling what we‚Äôre seeing in America ‚Äúfascism‚Äù is another Judas Goat effort to make you think that the status quo is ‚Äúthe best choice we have‚Äù so pull that lever for Trump to make all the bad things you‚Äôre seeing stop.You can‚Äôt form a polity or have an integrated harmonious society that shares common values and goals with people who hate you and want you dead (moonbat Lefties) or people who despise you and cynically want to exploit you while letting you live (the status-quo right).Check out some past podcasts and posts from 2018-early 2019 around here and you‚Äôll see a different perspective from what‚Äôs on sale today.

            I like third positionism in theory (Keith Woods did a good primer video on it) but why is it so tied to ethno-nationalism or retro national socialism (I won‚Äôt use the other N-word) here in the US? Can‚Äôt third positionists just be for hierarchy and order, ethnic/cultural/religious dominance leading to social cohesion, and rejection of materialist economic BS?

                Third position is just an effort to re-brand fascism. The label comes from the Cold War era, when the choices were Bolshevism and Capitalism. It fails the basic test of putting politics ahead of biology, culture and history.

                why is it so tied to ethno-nationalism
Well, the thinking is that politics is downstream from culture, and culture is downstream from race/ethnicity.  If you ignore race/ethnicity, you are pissing upstream of your water supply.

            I‚Äôm highly interested in a true ‚Äúthird position,‚Äù one that incorporates the aspects of both capitalism and socialism that run true to human nature and discards the rest.
What I‚Äôm seeking is not what Erik Striker is selling.  Striker (and Enoch too now, I guess) are simply peddling antisemitic Marxism, which is an oxymoron given the inherent Jewishness of Marxism.

                I don‚Äôt listen to TRS very often these days, but they have taken antisemitism and created a reactionary ideology out of it. From an anthropological and historical perspective, it is interesting. The old anti-Semites just tried to match Jewish ethnocentrism with their own version of ethnocentrism. Enoch and others in that space are trying to create an ideology out of hating Jews. It‚Äôs a lot like what the black Muslims did by combining Islam with hatred of whites. I‚Äôm a bit surprised they have not reached into Islam yet. Maybe they have, but back when I listened they were not going down that road.There is a form of white nationalism in Europe that embraces a Euro-version of Islam. I forget what they call it, but that‚Äôs the basic drift of it. I don‚Äôt think they have big numbers, but every journey starts with the first step.

                    I understand what the TRS guys want, and it‚Äôs nice.  I like it.  But the road there does not go through AOC like policies.  Also, this isn‚Äôt Europe.  We don‚Äôt have an assortment of postage stamp sized countries each with a unique history.  Taking our white people alone, you have unique sub-cultures.  I don‚Äôt think the hate that northern, blue state libs have for red state people can be separated from regionalism.  Even if Daisy Duke became a full blown Antifa commie they would still consider her to be uncultured white trash.  A unified white community can‚Äôt even be created in ideal conditions.  You can‚Äôt achieve anything remotely similar to what they want in our massive 320 million superstate.  Also, while I like how they go after the Jews (no one else seems to) a lot of Jewish behavior can be explained by the simple fact that they have no New Testament.  They stop at Malachi.  If your religion stopped at Malachi wouldn‚Äôt you be producing porn and owning a chain of seedy check cashing stores?  It‚Äôs not a conspiracy, it‚Äôs just a seedy way of life.

                        I like this comment a lot. If I had any idea how the voting module worked, I‚Äôd set the upvote for this to infinity. The reason is you are stating pretty much what I have said for a long time. American has always been a multiracial and multicultural country. The founders understood this.As far as our greatest ally, I‚Äôm not much in for conspiracy theories, reductionism or teleology, so much of what modern antisemitism has to say falls flat with me. I‚Äôm simply too rooted in biological realism for much of that stuff. I‚Äôm also old enough to remember when Don Black, David Duke and that whole scene had their moment, so listening to TRS content is like watching an old movie, where the good guy dies in the end.Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt wish them harm. That goes for all the people that came out of the alt-right. I may not like some of them or agree with them, but I don‚Äôt wish them ill.

            I think breezy analysis like ‚ÄúThe closest thing we have to genuine fascists in modern America are the people claiming to be anti-fascists‚Äù is cheap, ineffectual ‚ÄúAntifa are therealfascists!‚Äù rhetoric along the lines of what Dinesh and ConInc are constantly blabbing, but I still think Z‚Äôs larger point stands.The TRS guys are fun to listen to and their ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù episodes are particularly good, but I think NazBols more or less have the same ‚Äúreal fascism was never tried‚Äù blind spot that leftists have with their ‚Äúreal communism was never tried‚Äù blind spot.I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything necessarily wrong with believing in or being motivated by a platonic ideal, but the blind spot results in NazBol‚Äôs inability to appreciate that fascism can be corrupted like any other human endeavor, and therefore they can‚Äôt seewhere and howit has already been adopted by polities that claim they aren‚Äôt practicing it.The fusion of government and corporate power in the US to impose a very precise rainbow-nationalist ideal is unmistakably fascist. China and North Korea are merely more precise in the imposition and application of their nationalist ideal: they merely filter out most of the colors in the rainbow. But as they get wealthier, even in China the cracks in their filtering are appearing and more colors are ever-so-slowly being added to their rainbow. China will be a mirror of the US in less than two decades.I also don‚Äôt get the preoccupation with rehabilitating Hilter among NazBols. Just as my attention fades when leftists start prattling about Marx, my eyes glaze over when TRS starts on ‚ÄúWell, Hitler thought‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúWell, actually Hitler practiced‚Ä¶‚Äù I just don‚Äôt get why so much effort is put into the hope that rehabilitating one person will somehow unlock the answers to our future. I‚Äôm just not big on any movements or theories that are wrapped around singular historical figures, because those movements always end up exhausting their energy on hyper-analyzing everything that figure said and did, and trying to shoehornnewevents andnewideas into the box of whatever the historical figure thought.Sure, figures like Hitler, Hussein, Castro, and others were far more complex and interesting than the watered-down caricatures we‚Äôre taught in school, but cults of personality never have longevity. Dissidentscannotput all their hope into singular leaders; this perpetual hope on the right is exactly why the right never got anywhere. The Pinochets and Hitlers and Francos all have to die sometime, and after them‚Ä¶ what?

            In a normally functioning Western ethnic society we wouldn‚Äôt have a one-size-fits-all approach to how things evolve and operate.Different Estates would have evolved differently yet symbiotically.Each Estate or if you prefer Caste (Class presupposes a bolshey antagonistic and not a symbiotic relationship between Castes) would have a different internal social order, develop their own subculture, their own on-ramp to our wider institutions and their own political and economic arrangements.  This is how our own internal diversity would manifest itself. A long evolutionary history of cooperative differentiation. This is pretty much how thing came to be and how we rebuilt the West after the collapse of Rome.Some form of libertarianism, 3rd positionism, socialism, +/-‚Ä¶would probably find a natural home in how differentiation worked itself out. A natural laboring class would be better off under some attenuated form of socialism, a natural entrepreneurial class under some form of measured libertarianism and a natural bourgeoisie under some form of 3rd positionism. None of them given free rein so they don‚Äôt run roughshod over everyone else.Having this conversation, at least the way it‚Äôs being discussed, is working against our immediate interests.  If we are to have this conversation now then let us agree that when we are again the master of our own lands‚Ä¶that every Estate will have its day and its due.An attempt to shoehorn everyone on this side of the upheaval strikes me as a bait cutting not fishing.

        The closest thing we have to genuine fascist in modern America are the people claiming to be anti-fascists.Those saying they are defending democracy are in fact trying to eliminate it. Those who supposedly want authoritarianism really want something closer to a bourgeois civic utopia.A very timely video making the rounds related to this that I strongly advise you not only watch but send to every lefty wingnut you know. Remember that this entire thing is feminine in nature as Z pointed out. When they start droning on in NPC like fashion about their latest CNN talking point just show them this vid.To that end (feminine nature), social shaming and ridicule is your strongest tactic here because women and soy infused manginas respond most strongly to exclusion from the herd as that is what their room temp IQs can comprehend and not much more.This vid says quite a bit in under 2 minutes about how this inverted reality actually looks to the few of us who are still sane:https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=Ev373c7wSRg&amp;amp;

        National Socialists advocate for nationalized banking for good reasons. Before condemning the idea, perhaps find out what those reasons are and provide a counter-argument.

        Yes, this is a death rattle and an end of a system. That means something else will fill the breach. I somehow don‚Äôt think the people in the street ‚Äúprotesting‚Äù for ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù will have much, if any hand, in what comes next. They‚Äôre basically like a disgraced stockbroker who got a DUI and now pays cartons of cigarettes to the gangs in prison to ensure he doesn‚Äôt get stabbed or raped. If they actually got any of what they‚Äôre demanding (defunding police, the end of the white power structure, etc.) they would be torn apart pretty quickly. Normal Hispanics hate blacks more than white people ever could, and if the Indians and Chinese pick over the carcass of our country after it collapses, blacks will literally be enslaved, and no tears will be shed (only white people care about black people and their grievances). The problem with the talented tenth is the same problem with our elite; they have little or no contact with reality or the real world; the green-eyed mulatta lecturing rooms of white people about her struggle knows less about black people than any white person reading this.

            Problem is that blacks cannot imagine a world where they don‚Äôt get to spend 24√ó7 bitching about white people.  Same experience though, I keep telling people that if law and order goes sideways the local hispanics (Puerto Ricans, but some Dominicans) will have the blacks ethnically cleansed from their neighborhoods in an afternoon; white people are the only ones who keep that from happening.

                Exactly right.  That‚Äôs the maddening thing about blacks.  Literally everything they have or have become is due to Whites.  I imagine the brighter ones know this deep down, yet they are such egotistic creatures, it simply can‚Äôt be admitted or acknowledged.  It is our sufferance that indulges their whims, petulance and criminality.  In their arrogance, they see themselves running the whole show when Whitey is basically out of the picture.  What they are too blind to see, are all the other POCs who won‚Äôt be doing any indulging at all.

        Maybe. I think Lefty does this to manage the fact that his hatreds are unspeakable. He hated God, Whites, family, and Western civilization ‚Äì which is merely the expression of the first three hatreds. How can he speak his hatreds without justification? Justification, ever since WWII, has come in the form of the hated thing being oppressive and authoritarian and, in a great example of how we conflate words with their underlying ideas, fascist. It‚Äôs the same linguistic process by which a spiky pig becomes a porcupine, and its own separate thing.I‚Äôd suggest that a big part of the success of Lefty has been that most people accept his conceit that the Open Society is a moral imperative. The idea that a society should allow copperheads in the back yard because, well, maybe they have a right to be there and, anyway, surely the mongooses will be attracted to them and solve the problem for us was always reckless. Now we see why.Look, the American system is simply awful. It failed twice and had to be re-written, once in 1860 and once in 1965. The new Constitution we live under was always an implicit rejection of the core principles of the first two, and this one doesn‚Äôt work, either.

It was not merely reckless, though ‚Äì it was counter-intuitiveandcontra centuries of experience and common sense.  While most people need to learn the hard way, that‚Äôs not the best manner to build a functional society.  Those types of idiots need to be kept under control and out of authority.  The degeneracy promoted as part of the ‚Äòmoral imperative‚Äô today was conceived and has always been promoted by a very specific people, e.g. see ‚ÄúThe Authoritarian Personality‚Äù by the usual suspects.

Are you agreeing or disagreeing with ‚Äúbrainwashing people into believing there is some objective Truth out there‚Äù ?(Note the purposeful use of a capital ‚ÄúT‚Äù.)
Your statement reads like you disagree with the existence of an actual observable, objective Truth.Is that the case, Sentry?

                        And that is why, when you inhabit a place, there is value in making it unattractive to the wine and cheese crowd. The pozz finds the ‚Äúnice‚Äù places, moves there, and infects them with their ideas, and the locals often never see it coming.Wine and cheeses hate the sound of gunfire (keep an outdoor shooting range nearby), full size trucks (drive and park them everywhere), and public demonstrations of youthful enthusiasms of various sorts, especially after dark (parties, driving around, beer cans, music).  A bit of all of the above, properly culturally vetted, makes them more comfortable elsewhere.  They can move closer once they figure out the score for real.

        The idea that America is fascistic is patently false. It is certainly authoritarian, but it doesn‚Äôt have even a hint of fascism anywhere. The open borders internationalization of the economy is antithetical to anything that any fascist intellectual ever advocated or worked towards. In fact, fascism was inherently about the protection of the nations people and families against cultural degeneracy and the advance of international economic interests. With both parties in the US now fighting to see who can do more for foreigners, transexuals, and ‚Äòour greatest ally‚Äô, we could be so lucky to see genuine fascism actually make an appearance.

            Not economically.  Fascism is an economic doctrine.  The fact that the men of the 1930s gave it a nativist direction rather than an internationalist one is what‚Äôs missing.  Economically we‚Äôre very close to that.  All you have to do is land at Dulles and see all of the Fortune 500 nameplates along the tollway.  Why there?

                There‚Äôs not even a whiff of what was called ‚Äòcorporatism‚Äô in the US.  Yes, fascism was a nationalist economic doctrine that believed in negotiation between the working people and the managers to provide both a living wage and national economic stability. That‚Äôs exactly what we don‚Äôt have. The running off of manufacturing is what any fascist would prevent. The rule of international economic interests in the US is antithetical to fundamental fascist economic doctrine.  Read the intellectuals in the movement from Gentile to Panunzio and Costamagna, it‚Äôs all there-it has nothing to do with advancing international economic interests and the profit margins of the Fortune 500.

        If you look at the policies of the Reichsbank in the 1930‚Äôs and the Fed today, you have some shockingly similar policies.  We don‚Äôt (yet) have wage and price controls, but when you overlay policy decisions, they rhyme.  We became a fascist state by the 20th century.  It‚Äôs always had a veneer of ‚Äúmuh constitution‚Äù however.  We‚Äôre actually in the end game of fascism not the beginning.  It‚Äôs like a pyramid scheme where the first generation gets the windfall and all subsequent generations are stuck with the bill.  It‚Äôs no accident to history that the first thing Hitler did when he invaded a neighbor was to transport its gold reserves to Berlin.  It‚Äôs also no accident that the Reichsmark was detached from gold.  One day soon we‚Äôll have a stock market that can‚Äôt go down because it‚Äôs illegal.  We already have an orange blob who said yesterday he might do an executive order to eliminate evictions through this ‚Äúcrisis.‚Äù   I only wish we had snappy Hugo Boss uniforms to go with this rather than Ed Hardy tank tops.

        HL Mencken predicted all of this and more.  The people haven‚Äôt become simpletons.  They always were, and democracy gives them a little more of their idiocy with each passing year.

            I‚Äôve read most of Mencken. For the skeptic or smart-ass, he is delightful. He would probably sadly smile, nodding  with irony, at the slide of his once-majestic hometown of Baltimore into the cesspool it has now become.

        I hope this isn‚Äôt too far off topic for today‚Äôs essay. I have a ‚Äúfree‚Äù subscription to Medium. Much of what I read is about racism and related. I usually post a ‚Äúrace realist‚Äù type response to typical SJW type posts. Today‚Äôs sample essay was perhaps typical, about how BLM would solve the persistent problems of racial inequality, and so on. I latched onto a single phrase the author made, as it was ripe for criicism:‚ÄúThe police murder of George Floyd, just one in a long string of murders of African Americans at the hands of police‚Ä¶‚ÄùSuch a claim is a perfect definition of the term ‚Äúbad faith‚Äù which I am starting to use. In law it can mean ‚Äúdeliberate deception against opponents‚Äù but I prefer the philosophical use, ‚Äúrefusal to confront facts or choices‚Äù. Applied to what we usually discuss here, either will fit, but leaning more toward the latter.I pointed out that police don‚Äôt ‚Äúmurder‚Äù as a rule, rather that they do a certain job that sometimes results in force, even deadly force. I also pointed out that in nearly all cases (99.9% maybe), it is the suspect‚Äôs resisting violently that gets him killed. I often throw in comments about differences between races, that these show up in statistics and so on. I conclude by observing that Liberal ideology rests on faulty premises, that no progress in race relations will be possible unless underlying facts are acknowledged.Now, returning somewhat to Z‚Äôs essay, yes, factions are usually deceptive in their use of langauge. We are at much at risk of that as they are, and we should try to avoid it. Z claims, frequently and correctly, that it is typical behavior (of all groups?) to accuse the other side of precisely the same behavior your own group is doing! Antifa is no doubt fascist in operation. This brings up another issue: ultimately, the only way to oppose force is with equal or superior force. Now perhaps examples of ‚Äúnon-violence‚Äù sometimes bring social change, but I think they are rare. Sometiems a billy club on the head or a bullet through the heart are required for the greater good. üôÅIn principle, I think ethnic homelands would solve many problems. Most of us here would agree that a world without Blacks would be much nicer. What would we miss? Pro sports, some entertainers, maybe. Small price to pay. And, on the surface, this would address many of the demands of BLM and similar agitators. Are white cops killing too many Blacks? We‚Äôll stop arresting them at all!  When it finally dawned on the Blacks that these demands could only be met by them living in a 100% Black society, they might start to have second thoughts. I say give ‚Äôem their own country and let them govern themselves. It‚Äôs almost certain they would rapidly devolve into savagery. But who cares? Since I‚Äôm dreaming here, we could even allow countries where kind-hearted non-Blacks could live with and try to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the Blacks. But Whtie nationalist should reserve the right to keep them out of our new country, too. Alas, I don‚Äôt think this vision is achievable, at least not without a bloody un-civil war. üôÅ

            A big problem is that when we push back on their inequality argument about blacks, citing racial statistics, IQ, biological reality etc. we‚Äôre in danger of being silenced, banned, or fired.  Soon it will be illegal to openly talk of biological race differences. Maybe, just maybe, they‚Äôll allow us to discuss fatherless homes as a factor in inequality.

                Yup, they are the shock troops of the order, allowed to run rampant while the people in power have plausible deniability.When people went to the in Soviet Russia gulags, the guards let the crooks, murderers and other dregs of society harass and steal from the political prisoners at will.  If the political prisoner retaliated, they would brutally repress him.But that‚Äôs just an historical tidbit, and has nothing to do with our current situation.

        Modern people on the left and right miss a very important aspect of fascism, maybe the defining aspect.It was (is) anti- materialist ‚Äì especially as a counter point to Marxism which tries to see everything as driven solely by economics.    The fascist saw the overriding factor of human affairs as struggle and conflict.  The militarism and nationalism and racism associated with fascism sprung from that concept.  Which is why they were mortal enemies of marxists ‚Äì even as the political organization and national economics of both mirrored each other,  Focussing  on those aspects leads to the   current opinion that they weren‚Äôt vary different at all.Its highly ironic that the ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù left of today reject materialism ‚Äì that‚Äôs a major component of their hatred of Liberal capitalism.  Embrace an ephemeral struggle to give their lives meaning ‚Äì which is exactly what their ‚Äúanti-racism‚Äù is. And view history through a racial struggle lens- as opposed to Marxist economic ‚Äì class struggle one.Its really is fascism, just from a different direction of that in30s Europe.

            The Fascists were not anti-materialists, they simply led with the struggle and conflict, as do the current Antifa.  That the material wealth gets scooped up for themselves and taken away from their enemies is simply understood as part of the deal, and common to all totalitarian impulses from every direction.  Taking things away from people you don‚Äôt like is a fundamental element of human nature, and one important impulse that is blocked and shamed by the faith and civil elements of ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù societies.

            Good points.  Most people in America are dealing with 75 years of propaganda about how fascism is the root of all evil. If it‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs fascist.  The political parties in the US use the term in a similar sense.  Fascism emerged as a result of the degeneracy that we are seeing now in America and at its root it was neither materialist in the capitalist sense of reducing everything to an economic transaction nor materialist in the marxist sense that similarly reduced everything to economics. I would encourage people to actually read the intellectuals of fascism.  They would be surprised at what they‚Äôd find.

            I‚Äôm all for cutting ties with the ChiComs.  Sadly global capital is not.  One of the most sadly amusing spectacles of recent months was people demanding reparations for slavery recording their looting of Chinese-made goods on their iPhones.

                OT, but Z will get a kick out of this:  Last year the MADOJ arrested a guy (Indian)  who arranged for Chinese kids to stay with host families and attend US schools to immerse in the language and culture.  Cost?  $46K/yr.  He was placing them in Lawrence and Lynn!

            I occasionally get the idea that Israel/Jews and China are having a shadow war to see who will be the at the top of the pyramid of the global elite and they‚Äôre using the territory of the American Empire to do it.  Someone else fighting a war in your own territoryneverworks out, they both should go.

        Lefties always begin their journey of political exploration by hating their daddy.  Sometimes it‚Äôs daddy‚Äôs fault, sometimes not.  They expand their daddy issues gradually, like a festering boil, to include all father/authority figures; police, government, church hierarchy, and always eventually God Himself.  I have yet to encounter a fervent leftie who espouses a belief in the God of the Bible, but is has been said repeatedly that leftism is merely the atheist‚Äôs religion.  True dat. Somewhere along the line they pick up critical theory, whether from a lefty proffessor in college, or by osmosis from the social ocean in which they swim; then, it‚Äôs Katy bar the door.  Everything true and useful is turned upside down, and that which is not merely discarded is inverted and used against ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people.  It is an eventually self-destructive impulse (as leftists devouring themselves is frequently the case), but waiting for the infection to burn out in real time is very uncomfortable.

                I don‚Äôt shrink from fascism. In my book, the country has been fascist since at least Teddy Roosevelt. Compare Teddy to Mussolini; the overlap is uncanny.The republic ended in 1865, and the country has never been interested in socialism or communism. Free market capitalism was an incoherent joke.Populism was an early term for fascism, with an emphasis on the citizen instead of the corporation.These days it‚Äôs private ownership with government oversight and control ‚Äî the classic definition of fascism.

        The lexicon has been twisted, turned topsy turvy, and tied into knots.  Fascism is anti-fascism.  Neoconservative are not conservative.  Liberals are social liberals and not neoliberals.

            The bastardization of the language is deliberate.  As is the defunding of the police, the nightly violence, and the encouragement of petty and not-so-petty crime.  The dissolution of normal politics and the destruction of the voting system.  It‚Äôs all of a piece, and orchestrated from on high.  It‚Äôs a creation of gaps in the system that allow theft to flourish, the theft of tangible things, the theft of personal security, and the theft of any sort of normally functioning society.  So the next question is, Cui Bono?  Who benefits?

        Then there is another camp that embraces the ethno-state. Richard Spencer gets the credit for popularizing the idea, but it was not his invention. The idea has been around in Europe since at least the 19th century. The Bolsheviks, of course, would have completely agreed with the notion of a unified people. They would have limited it to the proletariat, but they supported the end of the nation-state. The fascists, in contrast, completely rejected the elimination of the nation state.I am not following you here.The Bolsheviks did believe in a unified people based on a class struggle along with the perpetual revolution, and, in theory, eventually a borderless world. How is that analogous to a unified people based on race, ethnicity and/or culture? The very concept of the nation-state arose, as you point out, mostly out of commonality of race and language with religion often a secondary consideration. Nations formed in Europe after the Roman Empire retreated and common languages separated a common race. The Treaty of Westphalia was really the first intellectual explanation of the nation-state even though it had existed centuries previously.Again, I can see the point about unification of people but otherwise the ethnostate seems more or less anathema to classical Marxism, of which Bolshevism was at least an attempt. The theories of BioLeninism to explain what is taking place in the United States to unify people for power purposes makes sense and relies on diversity of outcasts.If you could, and I might even agree if I understood your point, would you flesh that out a bit? Thanks.

            The ethno-state, as Spencer and his camp use it, goes beyond Finland for Finns, Poland for Poles, and so forth. He means it as a universal white state. It‚Äôs why he is a big fan of the EU. Like the Bolchevik view of the world proletarian government, it imagines the end of nations.

            What if the community includes you?  Would you like that?
On the other hand, can you construct a political framework, that takes into account how non-whites behave, that protects you when you are outside the community of the nation in which you live?

        It‚Äôs rather redundant to play with analogies to fascism (where the state mattered much more than nowadays). All in all, what we see is a rise of totalitarianism so naturally it will share common traits with past systems. The difference is that liberalism, in my opinion, is returning to its barbaric roots from the (anti)french revolution. ‚ÄúLiberty, Equality, Fraternityor Death!‚Äù- the details are just in the interpretations of each demand. Just as marxism is a bastard, scorned (now forgiven), child of liberalism, progressivism is probably the final, hunch-backed form of liberalism in the dusk of the enlightenment era. The modernsans-culotteshave recently risen during theNight of Saint Floydand your bourgeois are a bit smarter with riding the wave and absorbing its impact. The situation is still not tense enough to require a Thermidor, hell it‚Äôs not even the early Robespierre. Perhaps there won‚Äôt be any need for Robespierre as the power-holders will be tad bit smarter with modern media tools and emasculation at their disposal.‚ÄúEverything for the community, nothing outside the community, nothing against the community.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs Real Karenism. Properly scaling, the official creed would substitute community withsociety. Today, the imperial US creed (especially under liberal administrations) could be phrased as: ‚ÄúEverything for theinternationalcommunity, nothing outside the international community, nothing against the international community.‚ÄùOverall, it‚Äôs always nice to tease wignats with logical consequences of their viewpoints, although to set a proper framework for dissidents/upstarts/pretenders it‚Äôs best to unify them under a banner of populist anti-oligarchism and anti-plutocrat slogans. I see no other common ground they could cooperate on.The madhouse nature of our political language has a lot to do with the rise of mediocrity to positions of power. Maybe nature has withdrawn her favor and we are an increasingly stupid species. Maybe our system rewards the ignorant. Maybe there is some other reason for the dominance of simpletons in our politics. Stupid people communicate in basic language, so they have borrowed the crude juxtapositions of the last century and repurposed them into new partisan labels.Liberal democracy burns out the last remnants of cultural capital it has inherited. Chesterton‚Äôs fence got picked apart and now there is nothing but a chaotic, unprotected, growing field, devoid of defined owners, custodians and preserved traditions. Every ideological pest, invasive weed and novelty hobby horse can prance around and there nothing to stop it from spreading. In such enviroment it‚Äôs natural to reach for the language and symbols that used to carry any meaning, old boogeymen in particular. After all, the schoolmarm country needs to scare its pupils with badwhites around the corner.To give an exapmle from another corner of the world. Polish patriotic/nationalist youth took up the cult of the ‚ÄúCursed Soldiers‚Äù as their source for aesthetics and role models.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursed_soldiersLaw and Justice politicians venerate marshall Pi≈Çsudski, nationalists and their conservative friends lean more towards Roman Dmowski, relieving the historical disputes of both historical figures. Liberals present a mixture of western political lexicon and local analogies, usually trying to hammer in ‚Äúeuropeization‚Äù as historical necessity. Hilariously, they accuse the ruling coalition of trying to bring back real socialism an reviving the one-party rule. Nationalists ritually get accused of racism, nazism and assorted goodies. Anti-communist rhetoric is still in use for utterly cynical motives, both for the ruling party and liberal opposition. Granted, Poles tend to be obsessed withhistorytheir historical projections, but all of it only sums up the meaninglessness of liberal democracy.

        America is a fascist country now. It may lack the snappy uniforms and martial order one tends to associate with fascism, but the political-economy of the country is much closer to fascism than Marxism, Capitalism or Republicanism.
George Carlin was in many ways just another 60‚Äôs leftist hack, but he wasn‚Äôt wrong when he said ‚ÄúWhen fascism comes to America, it will not come in brown and black shirts. It will come in Nike sneakers and smiley shirts. Germany lost the Second World War, but fascism won it.‚Äù

        ‚ÄúFor example, one camp of the former alt-right that still goes in for the fascist language and aesthetic wants a centrally planned economy. They want one government bank to provide all banking services, like the post office. They have even flirted at times with the term National Bolshevism. Putting aside the historical partisanship, no fascist, when fascism was a real thing, would have embraced this type of economics. In fact, they would have rejected it as anti-fascist.‚ÄùNone of that is true. It is a wild exaggeration meant to make those who rightfully critique a system controlled by a cadre of leftist billionaires look extreme and the poster look moderate by comparison; the website owner is a businessman. From my own examination of those camps, virtually none of them want the centrally-planned economy you describe. Disagree? Provide links and quotes.Those camps don‚Äôt want an economy where a small number of people control political discourse through campaign financing and ownership of information distribution; having EVERY ‚Äúnews‚Äù outlet owned by the left absolutely makes a difference. That is a completely reasonable position adopted after your side‚Äôs policy failed. We tried things your way and look where it got us. Libertarian ‚Äúlet the business class control everything‚Äù has been a total failure on every level.How else do you think we got here? It‚Äôs not magic. You rail about immigration. Well, the business class wants cheap labor, so we get more of it. You complain about minority this and minority that. Well, the business class wants the largest possible consumer base ‚Äî pure greed. So, they clamp down on anything from the right that might offend good whites in the burbs and minorities (like immigration restriction). Want good, stable jobs? Well, the business class thinks they can make more money shipping them overseas, so they bribed congress into passing a free trade deal which made that wildly profitable ‚Äî for them. Result: the destruction of the middle class. ‚Ä¶ and on and on. That‚Äôs what happens when there is a disconnect between what the public wants and who holds the true power: the public never gets what it wants and those with the power always do. You‚Äôll complain about this phenomenon when criticizing Mitch McConnell and the republican party, but like so many on the right you seem to have no ability to put two and two together on this matter.Example: The Xers and Boomer right like to make fun of the app where women sell body pics for money. They complain about the action itself without ever being willing or able to examine the culture motivating the behavior itself ‚Äî the root cause. It‚Äôs like an eternal hurricane for the blind right. It periodically makes landfall and destroys countless lives and someone always complains about it but NEVER examines why it happens; this means you are powerless to stop it or get out of the way. It‚Äôll just keep happening until the entire community is demolished.What you are seeing is the inevitable result of a system that lets a small number of self-interested people who do not share our group interests control everything. Humans are natural conformers. They see where the wind is blowing and they sail in that direction. Social ostracism works. Billionaires on top, leftists funded by them, ownership of information distribution = society goes left. This isn‚Äôt a hard calculation.‚ÄúThey want one government bank to provide all banking services, like the post office‚ÄùNo, they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a proposal floated by AOC and pretty much no one on the right. I have not seen it floated by any significant figure on what you describe as the alt-right. Further, this same policy is common in many European countries where you have visited and praised. It works fine there. It‚Äôs not in any way an extreme proposal. Hmm, government doing a service, transparent and regulated by the public, or having some unscrupulous payday loan operation scam people into poverty and corrupt our politics with their donations? Doesn‚Äôt seem controversial to me.‚ÄúThey have even flirted at times with the term National Bolshevism‚ÄùNo, they haven‚Äôt. Straight up. Post a link or it didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äúwhen fascism was a real thing, would have embraced this type of economics. In fact, they would have rejected it as anti-fascist.‚ÄùTranslation: Support my libertarian business economics or you‚Äôre not a real fascist tuff guy. You wanna be a tuff guy, right ‚Äî Mr. alt-right fascist? Then support my economics weenie.Furthermore: No, they wouldn‚Äôt have. Adolf Hitler‚Äôs economic policies in response to the Great Depression were very much out of step with supply side, libertarian, free market dogma. They piled up the debt and juiced the economy ‚Äî lots of state control. These fascists (Japan, Germany) were, begrudgingly, given praise for their economic policies which caused both to exit from the Depression much sooner than the United States did, which only really recovered after the Second World War had eliminated its competitors. Germany and Japan were relatively much stronger against the U.S. than they otherwise would have been due to earlier ‚Äî state sponsored ‚Äî economic recovery.

        Politics is dead. Ethnoreligious caesarisms will return, opposed to corporate ones. Eventually political terms will get longer to reflect this in the West, it has happened in the 3rd world for some time. Eventually liberal democracy, aka modernism or materialism in politics, reached its end. The plenty eventually dumbed down enough the smart. So is the answer in the past, who knows, but it has to be inspiring enough. And goodness knows the modern and postmodern are not inspiring. Aesthetically the past looms over us, it will all be dust eventually but for a while not so. Russia is friendly but still has nukes and a Christian duty to protect its nation. The US has still a critical mass of Christian whites in spite of the elites‚Äô best efforts that can be awakened. We can cut the sound and the fury no doubt, but we still have to act when needed. The psyop has to be won. Christian hierarchy, distributist subsidiarity, guild socialism, blood and soil. Peaceful separation as needed. There, you have your desperately needed roots.
