        Any racial “healing” will not be complete or even considered serious until Derek Chavin and the McMichaels are freed and recompensed for the travesties of justice that saw them convicted and incarcerated while criminal devils Floyd and Arbery were canonized.
Reparations need to be paid, but today’s shrieking grifters have it all backwards. It is we, the long-suffering Whites, who are owed an enormous debt for having to deal with the malignant dysfunction of the negro.
Per Fred Reed, blacks are a failed race, under permanent custodial care. I, for one, lost patience ages ago with our recalcitrant problem children.

            It has been said, and I as a parent now understand, that—there are no “problem” children, just problem parents.  Likewise, we once were able to coexist as a society with our “problem children”, then we became problem parents.  Sigh….

                Children, OK. I’ll cop to that. But once you reach the age of reason, or at least deem yourself an adult, not so much.

        The damage is already done. It needs to be undone. Millions of people need to be sent back to where they came from. In the US, in Canada, in Europe.

                ICE announced they arrested 308 yesterday. That adds up to 112,000 a year. I guess we could give them a pass since it was day 1.

                    Was watching Scott Adams,(don’t judge me), and he related that the flow of illegals has gone from 10,000/12,000 per day last week, to under 800 a day now. That’s creatures entering the country illegally.
I’m hoping that trend continues.

                        Adams said admiringly things about the fine and proper pajeets in his neighborhood were a good thing. Half of his area is populated by them according to this nitwit.

                            It is amazing how obtuse the guy can be. On the same show, he repeated the story of how being a white guy prevented him from being promoted in previous jobs.
That said, with Adams, you take the good with the bad.

                                Adams started out with no great wealth and then made it big. I think he now has 40 or 50 million net worth. That’s enough to call it FU money. Sadly, when people get that wealthy they are freed to be whoever they really are. In Adams case, he seems like a fairly normal White guy with a good sense of the absurdity of our society’s ideology. Like many “funny guys” though, he’s probably also quite a people pleaser. He wants to be liked, more than respected as a truth teller. Can’t really expect much more from a comedian.

Give Adams a break. Truth hardly ever wholly conforms to one’s perception. That doesn’t necessarily invalidate your perception.

                        Yes, the flow of illegals has been deterred, probably due to the Trump effect.  It happened in 17 also but then the caravans started coming and the flood resumed in 18.   Adams is a mixed bag.  Mostly tiresome with his showering of praise over his favored minorities.  The other day it was LGBTQ and how amazing they are. Other days he will tell you how wonderful immigrants are since they mow his yard.

                            mikew: Adams is a mixed bag.
And yet Adams was sufficiently stable in his professional life to have written &amp; illustrated a new “Dilbert” comic every day for almost a quarter of a century.

Adams’s psychological unwinding bears an eerie resemblance to Juden Peterstein’s psychological unwinding, during roughly the same time span.
Not sure what to make of it all, other than that Cluster B must be one helluva high.

                    CNN or the like “leaked” Homan’s plans, so he pulled back…Trump announced troops on the border, waiting for him to be sworn in.
Very likely that was the reason for the preference cascade…Vivek Krishna Swami made it clear that the luxury belief didn’t just punish one’s hated lessers, it was now coming for one’s own job as well.

                        Generally speaking, there’s no one more cucked on every single issue than a White cubicle code-monkey. For instance, tech is probably the field with the highest percentage of pathetic self-described “male feminists” as any. When I still bothered to go to tech meetups I’d meet them all the time. It was always a struggle not to laugh openly.Some of them now are starting to feel the pain of the Leftist agenda they’ve embraced though. The girls they pandered to in hopes of getting a pity fuck were mostly not after their jobs though. The Pajeets certainly are. If they’re anything like me, they also get about 3 to 5 Indian recruiter spams a day and if they’ve taken the bait, they’ve noticed how they never seem to get the job.

        The black female FEMA employee who went door-to-door after a disaster and ignored houses with Trump signs might have been the high water mark of affirmative action in government and the Great Awokening. The government did a good job of sweeping it under the rug but she went on a live stream and said that this was a policy that went way above her. That doesn’t surprise me at all and I also wouldn’t be surprised if it was a policy that came out of Mayorkas’ office.

        The left was incrementally getting their way, but the double whammy of the managerial class locking everyone in their homes and the biomass destroying cities completely upended this. If you go that hard, you need to go all the way, and the left, to our benefit, failed to.

            Agreed one hundred percent and glad I saw this before commenting. You nailed here a big portion of what would have been posted. The one mild disagreement, and it actually isn’t one, is “failed.” Yes, they came up short but it was due to prematurely acting. As I frequently write, the one real advantage we have, and it is a huge one, is that the Left is hyperkinetic and impulsive. A half generation or more and Covid and crime would have been killshots, pardon the pun. As it is, if you shoot at the king (again, pardon the pun).

            The Brandon administration certainly tried. It’s easy to forget now but the media and activists were positively giddy after that Color Revolution. Brandon said all the right things about locking up his opponents, turning over the whole government to Black Girl Magic, instituting a permanent COVID regime, full censorship regime, full-on lawfare, anarcho-tyranny, and DEI forever. But they didn’t just say it, the people they put into place were in there to do it. They also demanded that corporations get on board which they did. All their policies put DEI at the center from the very start. If it failed, it failed because the spiteful mutants were too incompetent and couldn’t be successfully corraled the way they were in 1917 Russia.

                The incompetency of the spiteful mutants is a nice white pill.  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer types are evil, but they are effective politicians.

            Yep. I wrote something similar. Covid pissed people off and showed that our govt lies about everything. I’d also add that the insanity surrounding BLM pushed a lot of whites over the edge. Normie whites could no longer hide behind being “colorblind.” They had to publicly admit that just being white made them racist and deserving of punishment. That pushed a lot of them toward our side and thinking that whites might need to team up if we were to stop this nonsense.The other issue is Oct. 7 and the reaction of the brown horde. Inexplicably, Jews were stunned to discover that the brown horde viewed them as being on Team Whitey. As such, Jews realized that the identity politics games might not be “Good for the Jews,” and pivoted to colorblind civic nationalism and even immigration restriction.

                Yesterday they were able to separate themselves from whites in one context.  If they continue to succeed in this project then all the proclamations that “antiracism has reached the end of the line” will look prematurely optimistic.

                    Interesting. That literal last-minute parting shot from “Biden” was upended yesterday, at least in theory and likely in fact for at least four years. The most interesting aspect to me is this was attempted although in the past Jewish-owned shell companies with black frontmen were used to the same effect. Wonder why the decision to be blatant? I think it shows weakness, actually.

        Freedom of association will do nothing to prevent what’s coming…because instead of hostile people rubbing shoulders with each other, you’ll have stratified hostile populations side by side. Race war will break out as soon as the blacks start going hungry. Something similar is happening in South Africa right now. Heavily armed White enclaves are setting up, surrounded by seas of black savages. How long they hold is anybody’s guess.
Hate to say it but the only lasting peace and tranquility that is possible…is apartheid.

                    Nonsense.Historically blacks have been servants and slaves… and criminals. Previous to the mid 20th century, blacks traded labour for food and lodging. Properly trained and domesticated, blacks supervised other blacks for their masters, forcing them to be productive and useful. In point of fact… our white ancestors – contrary to the myths of Hollywood – were far too busy to waste their time torturing and oppressing the blacks for fun and amusement. As long as Whitey got his money, as long as his slaves were working hard and happy… all was well with Whitey too. If blacks became a problem, justice was incredibly swift, incredibly fair, and incredibly brutal. It had to be, given black intellectual realities.We *could* have these people in our spaces in useful and profitable capacities… IF we were willing to train them and discipline them.

                        There is no way the “profit” would outweigh the horrific cost of such an… ambitious… project.  In any case, they will be a useful tool for others to use against us for as long as they’re around.  They’re not the only enemy working against us.  The best plan is one that ends the threat forever.  Linking welfare gibs to mandatory sterilization would help tremendously.  Encouraging/ incenting a child-free lifestyle for them would help as well.

                        A bit of disagreement here; reading Padraig’s Identity Dixie and its use of original sources, such as interviews with and writings of the slaves themselves, it was far from “incredibly brutal.”The Southrons were a white, Christian people and treated God’s lesser children as He commanded. The brutality came in when Northern investors started horning their way in and treating the black slaves as they did their wage-earners in the north.The Southrons were long accustomed to black ways and rhythms incomprehensible to the cold, stern Yankees (and heartlessness of jewish plantation owners and black auctioneers.)A slave, as a valued hand, worked fewer hours, had more days off, had a portion of his wages saved towards buying either his freedom or another slave of his own to augument his income; they had the best medical care, good food, and steady employment.Families were encouraged, not as inventory to be sold, but to til the plot of land each slave was alloted to grow their own produce, which they then sold to the master’s house or to each other. Their extra income went to a tab at the local store where they bought sundries, even writing materials, pen and paper.The blacks themselves lamented the loss of their stable prosperity and their beloved ‘massas’, Christian folk who treated them will the familiarity and affection due one’s own small village.They lived together, for cripes’ sakes, the breaking up of families and forced breeding didn’t come along until cotton began to fade and northern investors demanded new investment in tobacco. Capitalist greed, a feature of Puritan culture, produced the ugliness that the abolitionist progressives themselves then crusaded against.Yes, there was brutality, terrible, shocking, and much complained about by the Southerners themselves; as much and more as the Puritan “indentured servant” masters and ship captains…but not as much as Sherman’s genocide, first against the South, and then against the Indian tribes. Once again, they cry out as they strike you.

            I don’t know why you hate to say that. It’s quite obvious, after all. And while apartheid, or Jim Crow, Jr., may be an acceptable, temporary fallback position, the ultimate outcome must be separate nations. Give the nuggras Mississippi and Alabama, build an electrified wall around them, and then forget them forever.

                This was one time we should have listened to the small hats.Eli Wallace, a Finkel from Brooklyn, came out as “Elijah Muhummed”, the creator of Nation of Islam and murderer of apostate Malcolm X.
“Elijah” sought a breakaway Black Muslim state in Mississippi, a Palestine on the Gulf. He might’ve succeeded where the South had failed, had we listened to him instead of that other Finkel fraud, Micheal King.
Another fine example of deftly playing both sides.  They make their product, heroin, illegal, then ply the black communities and Panther groups with it.

        I know you guys rag on us Boomers. Fair enough. We had some advantages. But we also were the first victims of antiracism and antisexism. And we weren’t prepared for it because we were told the system was “fair.” I was talking with a Boomer friend of mine the other day about jobs we lost to incompetents because of affirmative action.

                Statistically true. And heritage black Americans are a numerically insignificant minority now, compared to the others. They monopolize crime and low-level bureaucracy and a certain kind of celebrity, pretty much, but in competitive endeavors—e.g., the tech jobs that white graduates are systematically excluded from—they’re not part of the equation. Even at their pre-Great Society social peak, they barely were.Hence the Replacement™. Blackscan’tdisplace whites, and they don’t really care to. They want to steal from us and ruin our days, arc a piss into the social gearbox. That’s what patriotism is to them, their rightful American place. And that’s honorable—compared to the others, the un-American swarm that’s been called in to do the job blacks won’t do.We, starting with Trump, are being sold a return to “merit.” Like “diversity,” this is a term of art, an esotericism, not the word as normal language has it. Like “diversity,” it means anti-whiteness. Ask a Jew or Asian.For whatever reason, probably some of my mother’s evil genes, I don’t share the American idea that it matters what the law says. Ideally law would be fair and just and whatever, but it doesn’t matter if it is. It only matters whathappens. Will Harvard admit and Elon hire the abandoned white boys now? Will the bureaucracy, the military, the post office obey an executive command tobe fair? They will not.

                I can’t speak to other fields but by the late 1990’s in computer programming the boomer white men who pioneered the PC software industry and who, being in their forties should have been enjoying the prime of their careers, were instead being replaced by dot-Indians and other minorities. I was a hiring manager at the end of my career and saw firsthand how HR would only send us those diversity candidates for consideration, despite the common knowledge than many whites with relevant experience had recently been laid off and were looking for work. It’s one of the many reasons I resigned in disgust.Not many female candidates that I can remember. But it was still the early days of the push to encourage girls to learn programming. Blacks were also scarce, but a shoo-in if they were even remotely qualified. Otherwise and more often it was men from the diploma mills in India, Chinese, and the occasional Muslim.Or offshoring. Another of the last straws for me was being sent to Bangalore to interview candidates for a shop being set up there. That was around 2003 if memory serves (I’m an old man now).

        Somewhat agree. But I’d argue that some other reasons that the focus on race and racism is being cut off at the knees is that whites were beginning to push back – and Jews realized that they were on Team Whitey, like it or not.Yes, the whole racism version of the Great Awakening is like any other religious movement. It runs its course and burns out of energy, in part because it crashes against the rocks of reality. But all of us noticed that antiracists likely went a bridge too far in 2020 and 2021 when they pushed normie whites into a corner. It was no longer enough to be “colorblind,” whites were forced to acknowledge their inherent racism.I know that in my own life, this turned a lot of whites toward our side. If they were going to be guilty of racism no matter what, maybe it was time for whites to team up. The identity politics game only worked so long as whites didn’t play, and whites were moving closer to doing just that.The other accelerate was Oct. 7 and the reaction of the brown horde. To no surprise to us but the astonishment of Jews, the brown horde went against Jews, viewing them as just another oppressing group of whites. It’s amazing how fast colorblindness became a thing after that realization.Antiracism, i.e. anti-white, as a policy and cultural foundation could only exist if whites (and Jews) allowed to exist. Both groups started to push back and now antiracism in on the ropes.

            The people who claimed everything changed October 7–the aftermath and response, really–have been vindicated. Jewish power and influence seemed able to withstand anything but that was a misperception. I don’t think the genie goes back into the bottle even though there will be attempts, particularly from Trump I suspect.

                Even the Christians are slapping back the Dispensationalists in many cases, in their own way. We won’t get the credit for that either, but it’s happening.
The most credible effort I’ve seen is the claim, “the original Hebrews are dead, and the destruction of the Temple in AD 70 is when the Covenant passed. The Christians are simply the original Hebrews spoken of in Old Testament, a diverse peoples who have accepted and obeyed God,” and the authority of the Judean tribe at that time, with the Christ as the Judean continuance.  They’re squaring the circle.

        Ibram X. Kendi, the “antiracist activist” who made the rounds with his book a few years ago clarified things very well scolding all whites as racist. His claim that whites are forever guilty of racism and have to spend their entire lives and every moment to overcome their racism is a big wakeup call.Kendi, along with Robin DiAngelo have been a big reason why young children are taught to be ashamed of their ancestors and that no matter what, being white means you’re guilty for the rest of your life.There will be blowback for this.  Learning that there’s no salvation will radicalize many to say EFF IT, I’m racist

            Actually, it was claims like theirs which motivated me to pick up where my mother left off researching family history years ago.She was like a lot of women of her generation, a collector of stories about everyone in the family.  I’d always tuned her out when she started going on about the doings of distant relations and people long since dead.Genealogy was a hobby that came naturally to her and she left me all her research when she passed.The more I looked into it the more fascinated and the more connected to my roots I became. Proud even, rather than ashamed.I wish I’d talked to her more about this stuff while she was still alive.

        This is fantastic news Z-Man. Clearly it is the rescinding of an executive order. This buys us time. I looked around for a link I was sent last week but could not find. It makes the point that you made about how a Cloud Person getting assassinated by an immigrant being a catalyst for halting immigration.Well, it happened with the anti-white pogrom. The link was of the Twitter feed of an elite White man. His name is Sean Maguire. He has a Phd in astro-physics from CalTech and is a major researcher at Sequoia Ventures. He was doing a job at Google when he was told to his face that despite far surpassing measurements on his objectives, that he wasn’t getting a promotion or a raise in order to give it to a black.He went livid on Twitter. I know of people much lower in the stratosphere of cognitive skill and pedigree but nonetheless V-level high performers at Google and other top companies who were let go and then replaced with black women for diversity or who had job offers rescinded in order to hire blacks.I think this move is an opening salvo. These EOs and those that were rescinded are going to result in a lot of litigation going to the Supreme Court. Ultimately this is a Constitutional Crisis over C. Caldwell’s accurately called America’s new constitution of the Civil Rights Regime. This is just starting. Of course, this crisis is built upon the Civil War’s crisis that was never resolved. That crisis is built over the population crisis that was never resolved – the incompatible black and European populations sharing a country.Of course America has only layered on crisis of people since ’65. On top of the never resolved dual-ethnic/racial problem we layered on a new one in the late 19th century. That one combined with the initial one in Juvenalian revolution that destroyed America. Now there are new emergent ethnic/racial crisis that loom in our future.Whites are in the early phases of tribing up, and it needs to both accelerate and improve in its ability to offer shelter and patrimony. In any case, this move is a cause for great celebration. Someone on our side can accelerate the crisis by starting large class action lawsuits against NY for excluding White men entirely from the multi-billion dollar JFK project that is currently underway.Perhaps an injunction should be ordered to halt the work. That would really throw a spanner in the works. America’s unresolved problem of Who Are We is only beginning to come to a head. For the first time Europeans, Americans, are going to have to answer once and for all that we are Americans and define what it means from the grass roots up since we have never had an elite that was serious about doing it. This is a good thing. It is in our hands. We will make something of it.

                Biden’s attempt at grenade throwing is a dud. The period for ratification of the ERA expired long ago, according to the its enabling legislation. He was just trying to make trouble, unsuccessfully.
Making up law would be extremely dangerous, especially because the law is mostly on our side. Bad judges and dishonest prosecutors can be dealt with if the people are with us. Do you really think lefties could never gain power again, and use your precedent to destroy everything? Or some new kind of horror as yet undreamed of?

        The modern concept of racism was invented by Jews, who had no interest in racial equality but a deep interest in demonizing white Christians, their chief competitors for wealth and power. Trump’s move is a good first start but the problem cannot be solved until the country frees itself of Jewish domination, which will be a Herculean task (and one that Trump will not champion).

        In 1960, you could fit the entire population of folks in the US who were neither White or Black in Phoenix AZ currently. The CRA ran on the inertia of sympathy for a long time, but with 92% of the global pop eligible now, this train is out of tracks. The arguments and rationalizations for its existence in the first place was absurd.

        Trump has been doing better than I had imagined.  But this will pass, sooner or later.  Then what?The Civil Rights movement was a PR and judicial coup, just as the Bolshevik coup was a briefly violent one.These coups share something in common: they were organized, bankrolled and broadcast by the same group. This group has its own immutable qualities, above all a pathologically adversarial relationship with the rest of humanity.Which means that so long as as this group wields power and influence among and over us, we are in danger of more coups.Any action that does not proceed from this self-evident truth is itself at war with reality.

                    Oh yeah! I grew up in the South in the 1950’s and 60s, and Segregation worked well for both races. Whites had safe, clean, orderly neighborhoods and schools, and blacks had their own businesses and support systems on “their side of town.” There were no “food deserts” in their neighborhoods back then. Plenty of black-owned grocery stores and every other kind of business you can imagine. We very seldom saw any blacks even shopping on our side of town. The white segregationists knew what would happen if white girls began getting involved with blacks, seeing as how white girls are rather impressionable and run with the latest fads. And sure enough, it happened! I’m pretty sure it will take extreme violence and revolution to reverse our downfall.

        The problem with the racism grift was never about biological reality (reality is not subject to popularity or indoctrination contests), but rather that parasites gained control of the levers of power and used racism as a cover for their bloodsucking. No one gets to pick their parents, so you must play the hand you’re dealt in life no matter what race you get as a birthright. But choosing to be a parasite is a moral deficit that transcends IQ deficiency associated with race. It is intentionally evil and ultimately the greater harm to society. This evil is our true enemy and must be eradicated if we are to redeem ourselves.

        “there is no escaping the fact that the world has suddenly shifted on the issue of race.”
Perhaps in the USA, and belatedly even later in Europe. The rest of the world never bought into this nonsense. Two Japanese prime ministers remarked (at different times) how African-Americans pulled down the average IQ of the USA.

        Bad ideas never DIE.  In his EO disbanding DIEA (I didn’t even know they had already added another letter to it), Trump also required federal employees to report attempts to rename DIE or advance it surreptitiously through coded language.
So, I think the power of the accusation of racism will recede for now, its practitioners will reemerge from under their rocks to fight another day.
It’ll be important for Trump to codify his EO’s in the law in such a way that future Presidents cannot undo things.

            The dilemma for these monsters is whether to attempt a court challenge and risk the USSC declaring anti-racism kaput and perhaps even a cause of action for whites. I’m really interested in what the courts will do, particularly if the Trump DOJ starts suing corporations and colleges over retaining DEI.

        I have a slightly different view based on what we seen in the world of religion that last few days.On inauguration day we observed Franklin Graham representing conservative protestant christianity pray before Trump and Vance and mentioned the name of Jesus Christ, this christianity represented by Graham is largely Christian Zionist and friendly to the usual suspects.Yesterday we also saw the traditional protestant christianity in America in the form of the Episcopal service lecture President Trump and Vice President Vance sitting in the pew on the rights of sodomites.This version of christianity is also friendly to the Palestinian cause mainly because they are brown people.The anti racist energy comes mainly from the side of christianity we saw yesterday in that Episcopal service.However the Zionist jew has a foothold in conservative christianity and as long as it looks like the greater Israel project will fullfill biblical prophecy this foothold will remain In christianity in America.The zionist jewish power on the conservative christanity side will not fully abandon the antiracism of the secular jewish faction on the other side that supports what went down yesterday in that Episcopal service in my opinion.The secular jewish power that partners with christianity like we seen in the Episcopal church yesterday is on the decline.Christian Zionism and conservative christianity is not yet.Not really in my opinion.Until the conservative christians in America abandon their partnership with the Zionist jews, the power of the usual suspects to make anti racism great again is still with us.

        Allen pretty well covered it earlier, but the Left prematurely acted and went too far with Covid and criminality/mass migration. Those would have been killshots, pardon the pun, for “whiteness” in another half a generation. But the Left is hyperkinetic and impulsive, and this weakness is the one great advantage we have over them. Once people were locked into their homes for no legitimate reason and borders were thrown wide open, the equalitarian madness that underpinned much of oppression was discredited fully. Robin DeAngelo most likely double masked, unaware that her lucrative grift would die along with the Covid panic, but you would be hard-pressed to find her drawing corporate crowds any longer. She and her fantastical tall tales are historical oddities already.Anti-racism, particularly in America, was a key component of the post-World War II narrative, which is full discredited and rapidly dying. Blatant anti-whiteness, open borders and the Gaza War combined to throw cold water on the flickering embers of the post-World War II wet dream. Along with the official end of affirmative action, the widespread revulsion generated by the image of a repulsive, dykish-looking Episcopalian “bishop” haranguing the president and vice president yesterday about protecting faggotry and “migrants” marked the sun setting on the weekly construction of a Holocaust museum. Those ludicrous structures won’t be used as Nazi-themed water parks any time soon, but school field trips to them are going away. Look for DeAngelo’s anti-racism self-help books to disappear from Holocaust museum gift shops prior to be door being closed.

        While I applaud Trump’s Executive Order closing all DIE admins, I notice it says those employees will be placed on paid leave.
To have the proper effect, those employees should be reeducated through hard labor.

        I am of a mind where I disbelieve everything anymore. Was there really racism or was it more about people keeping to themselves and fraternizing with people like themselves because that’s who they are most comfortable with? That’s not racism, that’s just human nature.Likewise with the Jews. We all know their history, but they seem to have positioned themselves well in the societies they were in. How racist or anti-semitic can those societies be if Jews are allowed to advance into comfortable positions?My late mother came here in the early 1950s. She always had warm things to say about the black girls and how nice they were to her and how helpful they were. How much hatred could there be for them to be helping a foreigner white girl? Likewise, Italians and blacks were known for getting along well back in those days.No doubt there are haters out there, but systemic institutional and societal hate? I don’t believe it. It’s all BS like almost everything else out there.

            You’ve put your finger on an important point: “hate” and its fans.The simple and observable fact is that those who are consumed with “anti-racism” are so emotionally and intellectually shallow and retarded that they simply do not have the capacity to see or recognize anything beyond some shallow, one-dimensional “thought.” For them, there is no continuum of emotion or thought; rather, there are two emotions and only two: love and “hate” (and they use “hate” exclusively, not knowing that the word “hatred” even exists, let alone when and how to use it, but I digress).I need not explain this; all of you know it. Either one worships and adores [fill in the blank] or one “hates” [them]. For these retards, there is nothing in between. These dimwits are stunted somehow, both emotionally and mentally. I suspect that it is merely a sign of many decades of material prosperity and security. Americans–Westerners in general–are too rich, too secure, too well-fed, and they have way too much time on their hands.

                Prosperity and security certainly acted as the foundation, but the relentless propaganda led to the binary love/hate interpretation of relationships. The collapse of state-sanctioned media monopolies largely is responsible for the recent sea change in opinions on race and perceptions related to it. At the time of the collapse of the USSR, the emergence of now-antiquated internet message boards and the State’s inability to squelch them completely supposedly played a large role. I don’t know enough to offer an opinion there, but that is what is playing out right here right now.

Before, you had the slobbering “Love” section of the editorial, and then a small quibble in the Letters to the Editor section would be jeered as the “hate”.  Now, people having matured in the raucous web and social media age, are used to a wide spectrum.

        AA/DIE is fundamentally incompatible with the GR (after a certain point). AA/DIE seemed like not much of a sacrifice to GGs, Silents, Boomers, because they lived in a 90% white country. So what if some negros got AA jobs, simple math said the rest of us were going to have jobs too, still be in leadership, and the negros relatively few enough not to do much harm. A harmless little virtue signal it seemed to be. But with each succeeding generation, AINO got less white. Until we get all the way to Gen Z, in which whites aren’t a majority anymore, only a plurality, and this shit doesn’t really fly at all. Because it’s a lot more difficult to tell a people who are 40% of the population that they have to sacrifice for “minorities.” So this brings to an end the AA/DIE regime. But leaves us with another problem or two.

Yep, the problem(s) being that the less intelligent minorities outvote the intelligent minority for their (undeserved) share of the economic pie.  Meritocracy is not possible in a multiracial society since all *but* the White/Western minority is ethnocentric in their thinking and actions.  They will vote for AA policies as vs meritocracy even if it makes them poorer in the long run.  Just as long as everyone is poorer.

        As much as I agree with Mr. Z-Man, the practical effect of rescinding the Johnson “affirmative action” executive order is most likely going to be limited.
Why?
Because the legacy media/ megaphone is ignoring this XO.  Absent Trump actively suing private companies and, more importantly FIRING government employees associated with implementing anti-white discrimination, it will be business as usual until the Republicans throw the mid-terms.

            At the federal level, it wouldn’t matter that much anytime soon, because it doesn’t change what’s in the hearts and minds of the people doing the hiring.

                The dismantling of the DEI offices is important as well. I am not an expert on the structure of federal departments, but it wouldn;t be surprising to me if a lot of this work was being run out of those offices. Getting rid of true believers is going to be really difficult – people are already passing around how NASA tried to rename their DEI department to get around the inevitable (although, with a competency typical of these departments, they left a paper trail a mile long), and the EO addressed that. For now these DEI people are on paid admin leave, and while it’s annoying that they get a free vacation, getting paid to sit around the house means they are doing infinitely less damage than they were getting paid to work in the DEI departments.

        “The quest to eliminate race as a defining feature of public discourse ended with race as the defining feature of public discourse, leaving it with nowhere to go but away. “The battle is not yet won. As with any number of such initial actions in a war, the effect may only be adequately evaluated in hindsight.Seems today’s Z-man missive emphasizes one of the problems with wokism and DEI—reality denial—while failing take fully into account two other driving forces behind wokism and DEI—grifters and racial economics/SES.Grifters of *all* races will vigorously resist elimination of DEI as it is their rice-bowl and, perhaps not to be noticed for a generation or two, is that the employment aspects for the races will return to pre-60’s levels and types. That is to say we won’t be seeing 13% Black doctors or lawyers, or municipalities with extensive minority representation at all levels of their work force. Such is how the distribution of workers must play out in a true meritocracy.The Black middle class owes is current status almost solely to Affirmative Action initiatives undertaken since the Civil Rights Movement—not just hiring, but promotion. As we’ve seen time and again, these AA promotions have elevated the most incompetent of individuals. Once meritocracy comes into play, these folk will be eliminated. Will the minority races—Hispanic, Black, etc—accept this once it becomes apparent that their share of the “spoils” is reduced? Will future duplicitous politicians not pander to these demands?As within any society, there are always a lot more incompetent than competent. In this society however, we allow anyone to vote. Color me skeptical.

            There will be knock-on effects, though. One will be an accelerated exodus from black-run cities and localities that try to cling to a semi-legal version of DEI. I mention it a lot, but the sorting and ongoing self-segregation is ade factosecession of sorts and this in the long run is the most important thing underway. It just occurred to me that one of the biggest impacts of a second Trump administration is this will not be impeded. It was difficult enough to prevent the fragmentation with active government opposition. It is nigh impossible without such.

With the exception of Z and the commenters here, this problem is either not recognized or ignored by most men. There’s a bible verse that goes something like,“Women rule over them and children are their oppressors.”The women part is self-evident, but have you noticed that violent black criminals are getting younger and younger these days? 12 year-old carjackers are not uncommon anymore!

This country seriously needs to revive the “school to prison pipeline”. And introduce capital punishment for minors. I’m not joking. If you are committing armed carjacking at 12 there is no “rehabilitation”. Elimination is the humane approach.

                        Just allow kids to have daddies. That’ll solve 90% of your problem right there. The proportion of lifetime criminals who had no live-at-home daddy is enormous. And of course, LBJ’s Great Society will only pay mothers IF daddy is not in the house.Easy peasy, out the door goes daddy, and in comes the cash. It’s a racket.Of course to provide kids with dads, you’re gonna have to overthrow your feminist society and culture. This includes the feminist educational system (dominated by female teachers) and the feminist court systems.The Divorce Industry alone is vast and tremendously profitable. It is full of bloated feminist women running the law firms, too.  Go to a big city and check it out for yourself.  Get a look at the fat lezzies who are ruling over you.

O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.’(Isaiah 3:12)That quote was made 2800 years ago.  Yet it is even more salient today, because women did not act in collective power then, as they do now.  Progressiveness is female will writ large.Men don’t want to face this, though.  It’s easy to point out the drag on society of the blacks or dotty injuns — costs nothing.But standing up to the REAL power, women . . . now that is ALWAYS costly, in one way or ‘tother.Western men must grow a pair, or their nations will fail and fall.

                    Women are not going to root for your side, Alzaebo.  Hasn’t the past century proven that irrefutably?  The female and male mating strategies are DIAMENTRICLLY opposed, meaning conflict is baked-in.Women have their own agendas and their own set of weaponry. You ain’t gonna convince them with the truth or with lies to be mommies, which will please God, please the patriots of the nation, and — eventually, tho they won’t admit it — please the women themselves.If your nation is to survive, you will have to force, yes force, females back to motherhood and family.  You will have to raise and train your daughters to be obedient, chaste, loving wives instead of hard-charging, powersuit-wearing harridans with endless government and legal empowerment who Don’t Need No Man (except daddy).It’ll be hard and they will fight you every step of the way.  But there is no other option, much as men want another option.

        There is some poetic justice here. When the monster LBJ issued his notorious EO in 1965, the average baby boomer was about 14 years old. This tyrannical decree would haunt us baby boomers for most of our lives. The fact that baby boomer Donald Trump ended affirmative action by the same type of EO as LBJ is a delicious irony. The group that took it on the chin from the start, produced the man who took it out.

        Consider what law is. It is an explicit set of standards for behavioral proscription. A set of ‘you will do this’ and ‘you will not do that’. The purpose is conflict prevention and resolution.The invention of written law is often attributed to the Babylonian Hammurabi. It took a while for the notion to propagate amongst the settled civilizations.So how did humans resolve interpersonal conflict before the written laws of settled civilization? (1) Conflicts were mediated by authority figures enforcing the mores of their societies. Mores can be thought of as sets of behavioral standards (culture or memetics) and traditions for conflict resolution.Animal behaviors can be classified into two categories. First, instincts are genetically programmed behaviors. If we are having a nice relaxing conversation over wine and I casually reach behind my back and surreptitiously grab a cherry pie and throw it violently at your face, you are not going to sit there and estimate the distance from and the speed of the pie and calculate how long it will take to reach your face, you are going to flinch. Flinching is a instinctual genetically programmed behavior. Your momma didn’t teach you to flinch. You were born with that capability.The second category of behavior consists of those which are learned or extend from that which is learned, the more complex among them which are taught. Writing poetry and predicting celestial orbits using differential equations are sapient behaviors. The degree of sapience among animals, ranging from beavers building dams to space ship construction is a topic not germane to current discussion of law.Mores are unique to each ethnic group because mores are immediately downstream from  DNA. They are animal behaviors most rooted in instinct. Think of mores as the operating system that is running on the hardware of DNA, the blueprint for the physical structure of the sapient organism. Higher level behaviors that extend beyond mores (like using mathematics to make orbital calculations) are applications that run on the operating system.The similarity of mores among ethnic groups is highly correlated with their genetic similarity. Dutch are more similar to northern Germans than they are to Somalians in both mores and DNA.TLDR Laws extend from mores which in turn extend from DNA. There is no one-size-fits-all set of laws that will govern everyone. This is the very essence of federalism. Similar enough peoples can self-aggregate within a larger polity, and share at the federal level governance of behaviors upon which they all agree, and relegate to local governance, hence the need for segregation into subpolities (2), behaviors which upon which they do not all agree.An obvious consideration is that not all peoples have mores which are similar enough for them to share a federal structure. Islamics, Africans, and Jews as groups are clearly historically proven to not be able to exist in harmony within European polities of any kind. None of them are content to stay within subpolities, but always attempt to infiltrate/parasitize or outright conquer both other subpolities and any overarching polity-level (federal) structures.We cannot harmoniously share a system of laws with peoples who are not genetically similar. This is a prerequisite, a necessary but not sufficient condition.The concept of racism is a weapon created by the Bolshevik Lev Bronstein, better known by his revolutionary handle Leon Trotsky, designed to corrode and destroy law and mores governance structures so that internationalists can more easily conquer ethnocentric civilizations. The objective of charges of racism is to disrupt capability for self-defense.############(1) Natural selection acts upon not just individuals within a group of social animals, but upon collectives of social animals. The vast majority of time since the dawn of human sapience, when evolution by natural selection upon mutation began operating upon SAPIENT animals, natural selection acted upon humans who were perpetuating under systems with internal group conflict mediated by mores, not laws. The law period of human sapience is just a brief flash at the end of a long journey under social governance by mores.(2) Boundaries are not optional for civilizational stability. The corrosion and destruction of social boundaries in the civilizations in which reside is the centerpiece of Jewish collective behavior for the last 1500 years.

        It feels to me as though we’re settling into a “status quo ante” on race, along the lines of when we were kids, circa 1982. It wasn’t that race didn’t matter, but we certainly didn’t think about.

                        This is true now, but maybe not forever.  I think there is an increasing degree of alienation from, and resentment against, women among a growing % of younger guys.  Once this gets fully adversarial we might be surprised what happens.  Once a woman knows fear, suddenly attitudes and priorities change.

                            Yes, that is correct.  Women respect strength and respond to fear.I also agree that over the past two decades there has been movement amongst white women against the Woke Complex that dominates the western nations.  Movement even against feminism.A small percentage of women realize that if females keep ruling over the West, their nations — and their comfortable, secure lives — are going down and going away.  Some have sons and they’ve seen the beatdowns by the feminist teachers in the feminist schools, and that triggers the mother-protective instinct.Three decades ago when I started on my work, you couldn’t find one of these women with a roomful of bounty hunters.  But lately they’ve started coming forward and being vocal.

                    “True, but will the corporations and universities give it up?”In there lies the rub.  No they won’t.  The academic institutions must be regained or all is lost.  Higher Ed pushes out 10’s of thousands of woke/DEI “converts” yearly.  These institutions are a 5th column.Although resistant to direct oversight, we *can* make headway via another route—reduce the “canon fodder” we feed them.  Right now, we subsidize student tuition and pump up enrollment, especially those enrolling in faux majors.  Immediately cut these funds off, or only fund a limited number of students with majors in areas deemed vital to the national interest, like STEM.it’s a “twofer”, we kill off most of the “grievance studies” departments, while reducing the general Fed budget.  College is not for those with 100-105 IQ’s—that’s what HS is for.

                    Jeepers, this is easy. Just put it into the tax code. Start revoking tax-exempt status and colleges will jump. “What? DIE-related expenses can no longer be claimed? Guess who’s got to go.”

I’ve had similar thoughts.
End tax exemptions and yank federal funding for universities that cling to outdated DIE policies.

                    That’s the thing, isn’t it?No government anywhere in the world, not even post-colonial Africa, is as “woke” as any American school administration or C suite. South Africa is less hostile to whites than Google and Stripe are—thanHarley-Davidson and Jack Danielsare.Conservatives identify “civil rights,” a small set of historically recent law and policy, as the problem because that means it can be solved via standard lawyerly means, without any change to the system—without any change ofwho the system is.They truly are conservative.That’s supposed to mean theyremember. Do they remember when the Supreme Court forbade affirmative action in college admissions—and nothing else happened? Do they remember when Twitter showed Elon a hundred charts and graphs showing that H1-jeets are provably less qualified and productive than American engineering graduates—and nothing else happened?Anti-whiteness is not policy. It’s people.

        Amen. To be fervently hoped for. All the same, we still see people wearing masks in public even though the scamdemic is over, dead and buried. There will always be nostalgic types who will run a rear guard action for years to come. Mean spirited as it may be, they must be harshly ridiculed until they heal themselves.
