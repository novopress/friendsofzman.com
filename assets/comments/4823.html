        You jest, but I’d love to see a soccer league start up with the balls to tinker with the traditional rules. The offside rule is an obvious place to start, fewer players on the field and allowing more player substitutions would be another.
When the post-game hi-lites are shown and the best they can come up with is a couple of shots sailing six feet over the net, something needs a little re-jigging.

        Yes, if they would change the rules to shrink the field and encourage fighting it could be a major sport.

        I actually think, and this may be different at the elite levels of the sport, that there are fewer lesbians in soccer than, say basketball and softball.

            My hunch is the distribution is even. The soccer lesbians seem more obvious than basketball or softball. When roughly 1.5% of women are exclusively lesbian, what we’re seeing in these sports is way off the chart. That’s not a coincidence.
