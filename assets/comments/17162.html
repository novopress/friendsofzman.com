        I thought maybe there was a glimmer of hope during the Trump campaign when immigration was front and center.  Since the focus was almost entirely on illegals and the Muslim ban was about terrorism, it quickly became apparent that it was all about law and order with Trump, and not about ethnicity and race, and who belongs here.The patriotic MAGA folks make a lot of noise about Ilhan Omar, wanting her to shut up and get with the program, but there’s never talk from them about actually not allowing people like her, the Sun People from the Third World, to immigrate here.  It’s unthinkable, because that would be discrimination and racism, which are not allowed in the West today.  Nobody wants to break that taboo even if it means many more Omars elected to office.Recently we’ve discussed things that would have been unthinkable a few years ago that have now become reality, but somehow racism and nondiscrimination seem stuck in place, as America slides towards the third world, or breaks up, or whatever comes next.

            There’s a post on the American Thinker blog about requiring natural born citizenship for all elected Federal office holders.  I’d go even further and say all cabinet members, Federal judges, and State elected officials.  Maybe more categories.
https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/04/should_natural_born_citizenship_be_a_requirement_for_all_federal_elected_offices.html
I’d add a 50 year moratorium on all immigration, full stop.  Even spouses and foreign-born children (they could get residency, by not citizenship).  No H1Bs, no visas for foreigners at out universities.  Etc.

                I’ve always advocated for a rule that says you vote where you were born. States may add a residency requirement, but if you move to a new area, you don’t get to vote like the people born there. This saps the value of immigration as a weapon in democracy. That said, the people in charge are moving toward abandoning democracy, beyond the ceremonial. In twenty years, elections will cease in many parts of the West.

                    Immigration and democracy can’t go together long-term. It’s impossible. One side will bring in ringers, consolidate power and never let go. We’re seeing that in real time in the United States, but it’s also happening in the UK and other countries.
Democracy is not our future.

                        Democracy was never supposed to be our future.
It was a corruption of the system right from inception and has always been about “bringing in ringers” .  The only thing that has changed is that they ran out of ringers within the existing population – so now they have to import them.

                        Good. The key is to make it the Dissident Right’s future not the Left or the CorporationsThe problem the West is facing is that we’ve been under socially Leftist regimes for so long we’ve forgotten what an Conservative  regime would be likeSocial Conservatism and Economic Nationalism with systems designed to mitigate for the effect of technology in creating rootless populations , a good example being our hosts “Vote where you are born” ruleHaving thought the same thing  more than once my version is  in order to vote you must be natural born citizen (born on US soil to 2 parents who are US citizens at the time) have only US citizenship , be  at least  21 years old , own property and have lived or had residency  for military types for at least ten consecutive years in that stateThis way of doing things requires embracing authority though, no B.S libertarian  stuff. Libertarianism is  fine when you have  very few large corporations and  a population that is moral, homogeneous and mostly made of rural yeomanry. We don’t have thatAs far as the economics, a proper Nu State would have to steward the economy, control corporations especially large ones and push to a population of smaller independent business ownersMy opinion is that urbanization and automation driven  economies of scale raise the cost of child bearing and lower wages to such a degree that once they set in , our did around the 1970’s , fertility plummets and thus far in nearly 50 years has never recovered anywhere.1.8 or  1.6 forever  as we have now  is catabolic collapse guaranteedThe lowest ever recorded was in China with .4 and for a nation East Germany briefly .81/5 or 1/3 of replacementI think but  I do not know that a system encouraging smaller famliy owned enterprise in a rooted place  might work to make families workableAgain it might not and the pace of change may simply have overwhelmed humanity and it may turn out Alvin Toffler was right about too much change back in 1970’s Future Shock

                            Like your ideas Brother but I think it will be one of those things that can only implemented after the crash/chaos… I’ve been trying to keep track of all the good ideas so if I’m around after then maybe I will have an informed voice on how we go about starting anew…I use to have hopes that we could change course without having the death and destruction cycle but the more I see the more that hope is fading…Not because of the Commies but by those on our side that can’t seem to get their act together…Sad That…

                            ” had residency for military types ”Why the special treatment for welfare types?
Otherwise, I largely agree.
Toffler was right . The rate of change has long exceeded the rate of progress (but not “Progress”)

                    “In twenty years, elections will cease in many parts of the West.”  They de facto already have.  You get to vote for which actor will be the face of the exact same blob.  Or you can vote for an initiative like Brexit, that the state will simply refuse to enact.

                    Mayor Buttstuff, the current flavor of the week, was elected to the city hall of a dump like South Bend with less than 10% of the eligible electorate voting. DeBlasio in NYC was much the same. Voting already appears to be ceremonial exclusively in many places.

                    One side of my family was from Illinois.   The other side, Indiana.  Both dating back to post Revolution land grants from the cash poor Continental Congress.  Today, no one is left in Illinois.  Most of the Indiana side is still there.  Your theory probably would have worked to keep the crazies from taking over.

                    Speaking to normies, this is one that everyone “gets”.
As California goes, so goes the nation…because they’ll flood your native state and vote their disfunction in weather you want it or not. (See UT, CO, NV, Idaho soon, etc)
Western states resent the hell out of it, but “‘muh democracy!” Whatever can you do but embrace the inevitable.  Lay back, and think of 13 colony America?
(One vote per household, no one votes under age 35, freedom of association…not so much.  But great Zman ideas)

                No. No to letting them get residency. If they must be with their families, they can do that in their own countries, not in ours. Let those already here leave. That’s “Family unification.” The real thing.

        I lived in Rochester NY for 5 years and witnessed the decline of 3 of the greatest companies in America – Xerox, Kodak, and Bausch &amp; Lomb. While I worked for Xerox, we collaborated with both companies, so we learned a lot about each other. Each of these companies lost their way because they became so enmeshed in their own internal bullshit that they didn’t even know who their customers were, much less what they wanted. Although populated by many brilliant engineers, management was the biggest bunch of lying and self serving bureaucrats you could imagine. Xerox became almost entirely run by women, and they gloried in the sisterhood and advancing each others careers. The CIO won a big award back in the 90’s by outsourcing IT functions to EDS in a deal that almost destroyed both companies. I am sure she went on to bigger and better things. The bottom line is, I see America doing the exact same thing. It has turned into a massive self serving freak show where “character” no longer matters, government is just a way to gain power and pilfer the treasury, and the elections seem to be some kind of freak show, where the media tries to boost the weirdest candidate available to the top.Just like those 3 formerly great companies, America has lost focus and is terminally addicted to fighting each other over bullshit. I cannot think of a single democrat that would not sell out the country so they could rule over a heaping pile of rubble. As long as they have power, they could not give a shit about what happens to everyone else. Unfortunately that goes for most of the republicans as well. Those companies still go on. Baush &amp; Lomb sells salt water, contact lenses, and medical imaging equipment, Xerox tries to copy whatever the Japanese and Koreans are doing, and Kodak, I cannot remember what they do any more. They have all sold off any divisions that actually made money, and now I guess they are just trying to sell stuff other companies make at a competitive price.They were all destroyed by their own management and everyone underneath them jockeying for position for the scraps. And, while they were doing it, everyone was getting A++ ratings and bonuses. America is doing the same. We will limp along until China puts us out of our misery, but there will be a lot of suffering until that happens. Anyone who tries to bring us back on track will rapidly be destroyed, like they are trying to do to Trump. Until then it will be an endless circus freak show where the lady with three penises and a beard, who promises everything is free will be our next great leader and everything that happens will be blamed on the guy who tried to keep it from happening.

        But how long will the Western countries be “technological, post-industrial and post-scarcity societies” with mass 3rd World immigration?
The new political philosophy will be built for an age of unprecedented migration of people incapable of maintaining our current society of plenty. As Z-Man has said, we’re moving from the Ideological Age to the Demographic Age. Political philosophies and movements must also adapt. Political parties and movements based on ideas will fall. Political parties and movements based on demographics will rise.

                SA bears watching, but I’m not sure it’s an exact model.  We basically have in SA the Blacks against the Whites and the Whites are an extreme minority.  The US has at least three major minority groups, four if we include Asians.  It may be argued that all the non-white groups now seem united in hatred for Whites, but that is not quite the same as saying they are united in solidarity/love for each other.

                    In S.A its obvious, Whites must leave or die but the US is not like thatThe three groups are far from unified in hating Whites, Its  much more  complex than thatIn  Southern California , broadly no one likes Blacks  though Whites will sometimes tolerate decent ones .   everyone including Whites are starting to dislike Chinese a lot.Whites and other Asian groups get along fine with Amerasians, part  , Korean Thai and Filipinos being  fairly common.Hispanics and Whites get along acceptably with some friction but again this is cultural, White Hispanics and Whites get along fine and Americanized Hispanics are often part White anywayIndios are basically ignored and make up a separate groupThere is some conflict but race war now is pretty unlikelyIf it gets hot though  Blacks and Chinese will be in a lot of trouble, Asians in some and the White/Hispanic thing will get very complex.Where its gets  even more complex  is if the  Norteños  “Northsider” gang affiliated Mexicans , those above Bakersfield ,get into it, Some of  don’t much like Whites, prefer Blacks  though again this is not universalSo quite a few sides , all heavily armed with the White/Latino side being top dog.  That said soft Whites would do well to leave or harden up.

                        Our hope is that when genuinely threatened, Whites will “harden up” as A.B. succinctly puts it.  Even in my admittedly typically dark opinion, this is not impossible nor improbable.Here in the Southwest, we have any number of folk—myself Included—who have come from improbable backgrounds and have taken arms and patrolled the border with a diverse array of other like minded patriots, effectively.  But of course are small in numbers and overwhelmed by the influx of drugs and IA’s.The folks you see on TV are most often the yahoos, who want publicity and self aggrandizement.  The smart folk keep quiet and go about their business.

            Citizen, good observation.  Taken to its logical conclusion, immigration—leading to the decline of the producers and the growth of multiple minority groups/division—will lead to scarcity, which will lead to greater conflict between the minorities over the remaining resources.
Perhaps this is a possible cycle posed by Zman.  Scarcity is what initially drove our early American settlers here and what motivated them, albeit the fight for resources at that time was with Nature.

                This.  Z-man lays out how the Progressive view of history (toward a Utopian terminus) is bogus, and then turns right around and embraces something very similar, namely, his view that history has progressed to the point that we are past scarcity.It is not so.All it would take is the right scenario for a civil war in the United States, along with a big enough war on the world stage, and we would reach a state where (to paraphrase the book of Proverbs) scarcity would come upon us like an armed robber.We presently are experiencing a lack of true scarcity because the West is still largely a high-trust society, and it has a highly-complex, highly-interconnected and highly-efficient system for the production and delivery of goods.  What if, as Z-man suggests, we are reaching the climax of a super-cycle, one superimposed on and pumped up in amplitude by the Strauss-Howe Fourth Turning Cycles?  What if the upcoming Fourth Turning conflict (peak due in 2025 time frame) results in a cascade failure of these complicated interconnected systems of support?Drop the power grid, even a partial loss for months, and all of that luxury living disappears.  Trust will evaporate.  Means of production and delivery will vanish.  People will starve, kill one another, and die.Contra Z-man, scarcity is not vanquished.  In this world, we will ever live in the shadow of the spectre of scarcity.

        I’m so far right now that watching “ordinary” politics is like watching a cheap 1960’s sci-fi movie: bad actors on a crude, garishly decorated sound stage saying campy, stilted, cliched lines, with phony reactions to crude green-screen monsters.

        I think fascism was the logical end of western civilization. The traditions of the past were embraced with a revolutionary leader guiding the nation forward. It was a fusion of socialist ideas needed for the economy of the time but guided by the nation and reality. Fascist governments tended to work with traditional institutions, as opposed to socialist total seizure of control. A throwback to the enlightenment just happened to have the largest industrial base in the world and beat it off, but in the process also destroyed the traditions of the past in a propaganda war.So here we cling to the rotting flotsam of the enlightenment staring at the rotting flotsam of socialism adrift in the nihilistic sea of modernity.

            Xi has simply become the best practitioner to date of the insight Mussolini had about socialism during WWI.  China today looks more like the fascist state the Il Duce dreamed of, but could never execute because he was, well, stuck with Italy and Italians.

            Perhaps more simply put, universal suffrage was the end of Western civilization, at least as we describe it by pointing towards European and  English speaking nations. As we see in China, a fascist, strongman type government is capable of advancing a country from third world to first in a breathtakingly short period, while the party keeps control and provides a backstop to complete dictatorship, e.g., another Mao.  The people prosper more than they ever dreamed possible.However, the story of China’s strongman, Xi, is not completely written yet, is it.  Xi, being human, may well consider his role as leader to be unique and of the utmost necessity for the greater good.  He now has no term limits (IIRC). We’ve repeatedly seen such men use their newly enhanced powers to eliminate any possible opposition and removal.  Remember the last days of the Roman Republic, when the Senate made Caesar (after winning the civil war and bringing peace) Dictator.  A position previously awarded only when the Republic was in the greatest danger, and then for a limited period of time.If universal suffrage is democracy’s Achilles heal, perhaps strongmen is fascism’s.

        We have the energy at least among the lower classes to fight the hordes, it’s just that TPTB will send thousands of angry white men with machine guns and tanks to prevent us from defending our country.  They want the U.S. to die.Nation states aren’t going away. Tell that to Xi and he’ll laugh at you.  The notion they are going away is something promoted by insane Western leaders and businessmen who live in a fantasy world. The only reason it’s happening to it because of the people who run the U.S. and Western Europe want it. It’s not that the people do. The Poles, Finns, Russians, Hungarians, etc certainly like having their own country.They work perfectly well provided you have a homogeneous population and culture.   The countries that have embraced diversity such as ours are headed for a bloodbath. Because few bother to notice the immense amount of energy it takes to keep these states from going Rwanda among themselves. It’s patently non-sustainable in the long term.

            It all goes back to John Lennon, who wrote Imagine, the Nicene Creed of the left, which is why they have a shrine to him in Central Park.You have generations that build things, and generations (like that one, and subsequent ones) that squander them.  The reason we’re so careless in destroying this place, is because we never built it.  We never paid the dear price to see it built.  We never sacrificed, and therefore we condemn future generations to once again sacrifice.This is why I go apesh*t when I hear baby boomers talk about how tough they had it in the 70’s.  How they had to work a summer balancing tires in the heat.  That’s funny because my earliest childhood memories involve looking at empty Reunite bottles by the jacuzzi, playing with a mood ring (its black today) and asking what that little amber bottle is that was thrown out of a Corvette window.Obama was actually right about one thing.  “You didn’t build this.”  A broken clock is right twice a day.

                Rather than ‘The Nicene Creed’ of the Left, ‘Imagine’ is more like their Lord’s Prayer. Their Bible would be some combination of Mao’s Little Red Book, Saul Alinsky, and Dr. Reuben’s ‘Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.’ Their Nicene Creed changes weekly; you have to watch the late night “comics” to know what today’s creed is. At least the Nicene Creed (ignored by most ‘evolved’ ‘Catholics’ today, in practice anyway) – like muh Constitution – is still there, in the printed texts, waiting to be read.The shame of Lennon’s deplorable song is that (I think) he’d grown out of that fatuousness by his death, and might have wanted to walk it back a bit. People call McCartney silly and witless, but until that monstrosity he did with Stevie Wonder (Ebony and Ivory) there can no doubt that the most vacuous song ever spawned by these two guys was ‘Imagine’, a kind of ‘dirty bomb’ that sickened our generation.

        Automating and using software to process most of government’s functions will never, ever happen here.  The grift and political power that comes to the politicians through the current system is too great to let go.
Automation, as currently practiced, is a disintermediation of the current structure of things.  Ask taxi drivers, car dealers, or realtors how that works.  The fat gets cut out, but do do the profit margins and many of the jobs, especially the high priced middlemen.  The political profit margins and jobs must be maintained, at all costs, and so it will be done.

            A government that doesn’t redistribute wealth is a failed state.  That’s the job of the State, to put money to a good collective use.Libertarian thinking is entirely transaction and right based “You have no right to welfare and stealing is immoral.” but human society are based on reciprocity “We owe each other”The two can be reconciled but it doesn’t allow someone to opt out of paying for society .  In order to be allowed to be in  business for example  you have to give back and if you prefer not to hire people, fine. Either the State will do it or we’ll pay them anyway with your money.That is the reason that we have welfare in urban societies is we need stability.And no its not just food riots, such systems tie people into the common system , government good and bad actually is something we are supposed to do togetherIt also  prevents bad effects of good individual choicesIts very good if people save some money but if everyone is hoarding cash against the next layoff or for retirement or for healthcare than the economics effects of all that capital are terribleBest case deflation, worst case asset inflationYou don’t want post pension Japan or a massive amounts of excess capital with low spending. Consumption is the economyThey key though is to have a homogeneous population, without that, it becomes a spoils state and no one wants to help anyone else.

                A.B., your last sentence says it all.  You need to start there, then expound.  In general, the welfare state as it exists today, in our multiracial population, is doomed to failure and counter productive.  You seem to describe it as some type of righteous Danegeld to be paid or else.  I see it as unsustainable in a highly technological society where a smaller and smaller fraction of the population are capable of contribution such that they produce enough to earn an adequate lifestyle while the less productive increase in numbers and need.  Nothing said here is a promotion of some dystopian Social Darwinism solution, just the realization that no proposals for “more of the same”, e.g., UBI, are going to lead to a fix.  At some point, the productive are just going to pack it in and take their place in the dole line—and then it’s game over.

                    I guess I do since the net effect of high technology has been nearly 50 years of low white fertility.The White  TFR has been below replacement since 1972 (before roe v wade and ubiquitous easy divorce) and its never gone up . At all period in any nation.I do know it appears there  is no  social pressure, civic memes   or religious memes you can use to hack peoples cognitive process into having babies eitherYour choice is steady income and steady  work or no babies.And note the lower bound is perilously close to zero. The global record was in Asia at .4 per family (that is less than 1/5 replacement) ) and the European record in East Germany at .7 (1/3 replacement) and yes its economic not moral.Unless you are willing to make sure there is enough work your choices are not goodYou can pay up,  die back until there is enough jobs (and note this could be 80% or more if technology holds) or give it to the AmishThe elite would like to replace everyone but this isn’t effective, anyone with an IQ enough to do labor is effected by urbanization, Hispanics at a faster rate than Whites in factBasically unless we take all that Ayn Rand notions of who is productive and toss that  in the chipper, replacing society with something that works, we die off.I don’t know for sure what works though we could try Distributism and tweaking the tax code to favor middle class and working class jobs over machinesHowever doing anything at all will require an authoritarian state and will not be achieved with the current political systemWe may well end up with an economic collapse , a radical die back of the population (1/3 or more) and as a bunch of poorer nations none of whom will be able to recover in any meaningful way .Too many on the Dissident Right or at least the Militia Right seem to think if we could just break the cities we’ll be fine. This is not the case, empires do not go down easy and sometimes they stay down

            I worked on a project to completely re-engineer and automate the SSA’s disability appeals process. It was almost a billion dollar project – but – not a single job could be removed. Instead of people handing paper from one to the other, it was simply people handing electronic files from on to the other. The unions own these agencies and will never allow them to actually automate anything.

                Sure.People need work though  and if the private sector is unwilling or unable, than the public sector steps in.The only way around this is to have a strong yeomanry where most people own their own livelihood or at least are skilled labor.We haven’t had that since around the 1930’s or so.A yeoman system  is not compatible with large scale global enterprise.The Conservative assertion that government wants to grow itself is entirely true but its also the case that the elected and appointed would prefer to have to deal with a minimum number of people.  Its way easier to take money from the insurance industry than handle a 100 constituents or worse try and come up with something that genuinely solves health care issuesThat can be solved with a Constitutional Amendment limiting corporate and group speech and how money is used and given but it won’t solve the underlying issueYou can have a heavily automated society or you can have a  tradition driven society , in the US of independent free men. They are not compatibleThe problem is though the first is not stable , doesn’t allow reproduction or continuity of culture . The last is however materially less prosperous and slower to adapt.Basically a mayfly vs a turtle. Choose one.

                    There’s a way to solve both. Universal Basic Income. You would be better off automating a lot of government functions and just paying people a stipend so they can do whatever they want instead of agitating the rest of us. Who knows they may come up with something useful. Even if they don’t we would have less hassle.As for Corporations giving people campaign funds. The supreme court ruled they are people well then they can pay taxes the same way people can. Us the exact same forms and they can lose limited liability just like people…or they can declare themselves an artificial entity and give no campaign funds. Let them choose.

        I’ve long had similar thoughts about the path forward for the US.  Much neocon nattering about “who we are” as a country without much about who we aspire to be.  The opposition to a Convention of the States to amend the Constitution and how it might run out of control never struck me as a bad thing.The US Constitution as a framework for our government will forever remain, regardless of how amended it becomes around the edges, at best a civic-nationalist barrel within which we swim while our enemies shoot us.A runaway Convention produced the US Constitution.  The US Constitution produced (or was powerless to prevent) the current morass known as The Swamp.  May another Convention produce the next governing framework that is as much improved over our Constitution as it was over the Articles of Confederation.  I fear only the Second Republic of the Americas can truly make America great again.

            True. In fact, the failure of the US government only 73 years after the ratification of the constitution is damning evidence. Civil wars rarely settle anything. They only point out that the iceberg below the water line was much bigger than previously assumed.

        Karl Marx got it right — the relations between the means of production get all screwy and you get epochal change.  E.g. the transition from Middle Ages to Early Modern.  The ruling class was all-in on the old relations — swords-and-crops — whereas in reality, the new means of production were guns-and-coins.  In our era, “production” is almost meaningless.  Instead, the relevant forces are “access” and “communication speed.”  You can’t meaningfully control a “proletariat” that has so much stuff that it dies of heart disease and diabetes, but you CAN control it by controlling its access to health care.  You can’t control a “bourgeoisie” that lives a material life that would put an Ottoman Pasha to shame, but cut off his ability to get online and…  The first group to figure that out, and work through the implications, will be the rulers when the fallout clears.

        Many of these lesser and procedural matters will become irrelevant when the blue state cities begin burning down.  Imagine the Rodney King riots with no law enforcement presence, National Guard deployments, or Korean grocer sharpshooters on the roof.  Coming to the vibrant city closest to you.
That’s why we don’t really need a name or an agenda.  What we need is an understanding of the present and likely near-future circumstances.  The Left are not the only ones suffering from a form of normalcy bias.  Our normalcy bias is simply a different one than theirs is.

            This may  never happen.I live in a California  and while we have rampant decay, there is so much legal weed, I don’t think we can get a good riot going if we tried.As for that mythic day of collapse, again we can work around that and make sure there is food and cable and weed at the State level . We’ve done this many times before and can again.Hoping for the riot  season is just lazy. If the Dissident Right wants power or to end rule by the cities , they are going to have to fine a way to make it happen. The Zombies aren’t going to do it for you or make it easy

                A.B.Prosper, I live in California too, and I don’t think it will start here.  Look at the places with the highest rates of black-on-black major crimes—Detroit, Chicago, Kansas City, New Orleans.  The fifth is DC, but I expect the politicians to see that the riots get quickly put down there.  There will be copycat behavior in other places.  The Rodney King thing initiated many small riots/looting sprees in vibrant areas of most major cities.  Neighborhoods and cities with a lot of social cohesion will not see it, but most major cities already have their socially atomized vibrant “no-go” areas already.  Stay away from those.  Outside of those areas, people and neighborhoods will be tested, and will need to exercise their inner Korean grocer sharpshooter.

        “Whispered to the conservatives… today too there are still parties whose dream it is that all things might walk backwards like crabs. But no one is free to be a crab. Nothing avails: one must go forward — step by step further into decadence (that is my definition of modern “progress”). One can check this development and thus dam up degeneration, gather it and make it more vehement and sudden: one can do no more.”– Nietzsche

        What is missed and is the key, but you and most will reject is Christendom is key.CS Lewis noted progress breaks down when you go down the wrong road.  When that happens the “progressive” thing is to turn around and return until you get to the point where you made the wrong turn..But that is the only thing you do not wish to return to.  The shining city on the hill has a cross on top of it.  You wish to go around th mountain, or find some other city with something other than a cross.As a “deplorable easter worshipper”, I can understand, but dont know wheter to laugh or cry.  Like Christmas loses meaning without Christ, you wish to recreate some kind of Christ-less “western civilization” – trying to rebuild the fortress not merely on the sand instead of the scandalon rock, but on the sea.You wish the fruit without the tree, or at least wonder why oaks aren’t producing apples, pears, or peaches.  And no amount of pointing it out will affect the blinded lite-right than evidence can sway SJWs

        Peter Thiel constantly points out that the last decades of real innovation ended with the 60s and correctly posits that during  the 30s, with capital scarce, more things were invented or changed fundamentally than any other time.  And that today “innovation” in Silicon Valley is mostly everybody copying everybody else business model and trying to squeeze out a few more points of margin.  But nothing fundamental.  Politics is at the same inflection point.  Watching the Democrat town halls is like listening to the Spartacist Youth League Trotskyites that used to show up on campus periodically.  Even Mayor Buttlplug is simply a red diaper baby that figured out the old philosophy needed a more intersectional and less hysterical veneer.  Global finance and capitalism feels more like an exercise in finding the last few pockets of fat to digest and remit to a new class of oligarchs.  What people miss in the assumption that history simply “repeats” is that the themes may be similar, but it’s the few fundamental changes in the rules of the game that people miss.  These come back and end up biting them in the ass.  See Tenner, Edward, “Why Things Bite Back”.

        Getting to beyond archeofuturism is going to be difficult.  A big part of Faye’s views were dependent upon the coming clash of civilizations, especially the north-south conflict.  Before we get to block chains we’ll actually need a real Arctic Alliance to make sure the north cooperates in cutting off the south.We could make things a lot easier on ourselves by cutting off the gravy train to the south but that would require China’s cooperation.  As they develop Africa they will displace more and more Africans…who will head north.  It’s almost as if the Chinese have learned from our elites: Africans make effective bio weapons against your enemies and those you want to weaken.Block Chain feudalism has a nice ring to it. The SciFi genre Space Opera has often plowed these fields as have feudal romances. Except for a few exceptions, politics pretty much operated along these lines until industrialization.We’ll probably need a military dictatorship to clear the decks to get to that point.

            There won’t be a alliance. Why should the Chinese ally themselves with whites who are intent on killing themselves off?
The Chinese aren’t stupid like we are. They see us as competition and will use the Africans to knock us off. Then they move in with a small amount of forces and butcher the Brown skins.

        The transition that we are experiencing in the modern era is from an evolutionary model that existed for millions of years (and was based upon natural fitness selection) to a new form of artificial evolution in which the fitness selection regime is being fundamentally altered by passive and active intervention by mankind. The left tail of the normal distribution is no longer being excised from the gene pool and our social mechanisms are now rewarding and reinforcing hive/herd traits.

            Interesting.  I recently read a piece about the mouse utopia experiment proposing a similar reason for the population crash.  The author wondered if the West wasn’t heading the same direction for the same reason.
“Michael A Woodley suggests that what was going on was much more likely to be mutation accumulation; with deleterious (but non-fatal) genes incrementally accumulating with each generation and generating a wide range of increasingly maladaptive behavioural pathologies; this process rapidly overwhelming and destroying the population before any beneficial mutations could emerge to ‘save; the colony from extinction. ”

                Modeling of our species’ evolutionary processes have been going on since the early 80s and the new variants are quite sophisticated. Most are based upon Game Theory architecture and utilize input from a variety of biological, medical, and social data sources. These tools aspire to achieve predictive accuracy and also allow for case study analysis. Preliminary findings are not encouraging.

        It is obvious that the West has hit some sort of wall, when it comes to inventiveness in the social sphere. Regarding political organization, not much has happened since widespread democracy was embraced a century ago.Only because people never listen to Uncle Felix’ four-point plan to do to party-rule democracy what social media did to establishment media. It goes like this:1) You establish a political party, get elected to the legislature.2) You establish a website where every item on the legislative agenda is put to a vote among the party members. The result of this vote will be transferredproportionallyto your legislative seats: if a vote returns a 70/30% yea-nay on your website, that is replicated by your seats in the legislature.So far, so good. Now you have direct democracy, but that’s unwieldy because nobody can be bothered to read everything that goes to the floor. So therefore:3) On your website, you allow the party members to transfer their voting franchise to a candidate of their own choice: he votes for you on the party website.That brought us full circle back to the old, representative democracy, but here’s the kicker:4) At any time can you rescind your permission to let your representative vote for you on the party website: so when your candidate decides to vote for more immigration, you click the “vote manually” button, and vote yourself on that particular issue.So now you have traditional, representative democracy with a veto option on individual bills, it didn’t require a constitutional amendment, and there’s nothing within the current legislation that could stop you.

            Ignoring the technical side (electronic voting—bad idea), let’s concentrate on the aspect of Universal Suffrage—or what we now confuse with Democracy in modern parlance.  In what manner does this proposal produce, educated, knowledgeable voters, with the life experience, understanding, and desire to promote the greater societal good over individual, tribalistic motivations?  And that is the crux of the problem, the voters—not so much the system.  You are treating a symptom, not the disease and I predict the patient will still die.

We won’t know before we try it.
If we’d had democracy in Europe, immigration would’ve been stopped stone cold in the sixties. According to Ann Coulter, the same is the case in the US.

                    We have to try it before we have an idea of what it will produce?Felix, I applaud your effort, but have a low opinion of the general public wrt their ability at voting.  I’m happy to apply your proposal to a select body of voters—indeed, I’d insist upon it.  But half the population is below normal in IQ—and all that entails.  That is the essence of the problem.  We already know of few (read none) nations with a functioning democracy with a national IQ below 90.  We are headed in that direction ourselves.  We need less democracy, not more.  Smarter voters, not more.Get the biology correct, and it’s all downstream from there.

No matter who’s getting to do the selecting, your select body will be corrupted by the globalists in a matter of hours.If you want to buy a Congressional vote in a Krullocratic system, you’d have to buy every single voter, because even if a guy had 5 million votes in his stewardship, these votes could disappear overnight – not just at the next election –  so the globalists would gain little by turning him.The problem with our current democracy is that it can be bought. You can’t do that in a krullocracy.Also, if people had that kind of influence, I bet they’d take a lot more interest in politics. Why bother if all you do is choose between Tweedlidee and Tweedlidum every four years, and is screwed over even when your guy wins?

                This still requires your voters to pay attention and so still fails.You simply appoint someone to be your watchdog, someone who gives you a heads-up when one of your hobbyhorses is on the agenda.That way, you could design your own de facto party: you appoint your main vote steward, but then subscribe to a number of “We follow Congress so you don’t have to”-sort of parties.Apart from immigration, my pet issue is energy policy, so I have a guy to warn be about attempts to smuggle in POC, and another guy to tell me when something energy-related, maybe give me a recommendation for my vote.Also, your vote steward doesn’t even have to be in Congress, he could be anyone, taking machine politics entirely away from the party organisations the same way social media is taking away the raison d’etre for legacy media.

                        We have this today, we call it media including the internet, and people still don’t pay attention.They can’t do anything.When you cast your ballot today, you pretty much have to suck up the poz and the treachery your candidate perpetrates with your “democratic” seal of approval.But if you actually had the option of withdrawing your support when your candidate decided to sell your country down the river, I think a lot of people would pay attention when they got a text message saying: “Go block the new attempt to destroy America”. Especially if they could do it by just clicking a button.The problem is not as much voters as it is party rule. If voters had their way, we wouldn’t be in these straits. Granted, we might be in other straits – people would vote themselves handouts – but we wouldn’t be replaced.And as for the handouts, maybe a sovereign bankruptcy now and then is not such a bad thing: it’ll give the welfare state a haircut and be an object lesson to voters.

        There is no “path” of history. It’s not a trajectory to Infinite Progress and it’s not a repeating cycle. It’s a random walk driven by human decisions (often based on trivial motives), natural forces, and a lot of just plain happenstance. We look back and try to make sense of it. The cyclical view of Spengler (and Toynbee, and Plato, and Ibn-Khaldun, and Glubb, and dozens of others) is just an exercise in cherry-picking. So is the “progressive” view of Marx (and Rousseau, and Gibbon, and Kuhn). They’re all seeing faces in the spots on a tortilla, or canals on Mars.

            JR Wirth nailed it, fractals. Non-regular, non-predictable, but repeating at the macro, micro, and every level in between.  The fractal patterns are easy to see in hindsight, but they suggest that forward predictions are tough, other than the repeats will come.  When they come, and how they will be expressed, are a jumbled up mess.  That’s fractals for you.

            I think there are thematic “cycles”.  But these are more a function of what is hard coded into our behavior.  But to think that one can diagnose these precisely and somehow account for all sorts of exogenous factors is an exercise in hubris.

            History has a path; it’s not a random walk, nor does it lead back to we’re we started. With luck, we end up somewhere that’s the same, only different. Without luck, the nuclear arsenals are all launched in a paroxysm of pure madness, which is hardly impossible, given the spiritual chaos of our age and the fluorine in our water supply.

        Ours is not a post-scarcity world. I’m guessing that scarcity will be the elemental fact for 90% of humanity within a generation.The Earth is just a planet, and it has been worked – hard – over 200 years of industrial civilization. Our topsoils are shot, all the easily-mined fuels and minerals have been worked to exhaustion, and we face 10 billion people by centuries’ end – mostly Africans.Vegetable and animal life will be wiped out by the hungry hordes. But it’s all part of the Program. As long as Social Justice reigns supreme, then of course it’s worth it.

        There’s no doubt that American innovation has stalled, but that’s also true across the globe, even in Xi’s China. I’m starting to see merit in the view that we are entering a technological dark age, and the government systems that emerge from it will be more oppressive by necessity. The future is going to be small groups of conscientious people throwing a lot of sand into the gears of whatever monstrous system pops up.

            China is hell bent on making this century their century.  You see signs for this all throughout China.  They now call the 20th C the lost century.I’ve been traveling there for more the 30 years.  The contrast between the 80s and today is epic, especially in places like Shanghai.1990 – 2010They are industrious,  smart and pretty unified in overtaking the West in all areas.They still need the West, they depend too heavily upon our markets.  They are working on changing that.The old saw that they lack creativity is a load of bull.  Both the Chinese(300 million live in the modern world) and Japanese (120 million) file as many or more patents than does the US.In patents that involve industrial technology it’s not even close.

            That was a rhetorical flourish. That said, walk around and think about the government duties that can be automated today. People tend to focus on the private sector, but much of the administrative state can be turned over to software. That truth places us well outside of anything political thinkers of the past ever contemplated. That does not mean those prior age thinkers are irrelevant. It just means we are in need of new thinking to incorporate the massive changes in the West.Walking around Saint Petersburg, what struck me is my ancestors left, assuming they would never see any of it again. Travel for most people was a massive undertaking. I visited four countries in a week. The modern migrant can live in an alien land, stay in touch with his home village via his mobile phone and make frequent trips home.

                Much of the administrative state seems to be, consciously or not, outsourced to putatively private organizations already. Amazon now in effect bans books spreading crimethink. Domain registration is denied routinely to dissident sites yet porn bordering on cheese pizza lives freely online. One of the dissident right groups just had their bank account frozen, by the bank itself. Imagine if a bank discriminated against a group because it advocated Muslim interests; it could never happen. Better comparison: suppose a bank did this to a group that supported Sanders or socialist views. The bank would be sued forcefully or the administrative state itself would step in and coerce it to cooperate. Make no mistake, certain political views now have been made effectively illegal in practice if not in law.

        The Trump presidency, sadly, has indeed turned into an odd Reagan nostalgia play. MAGA went from “Make America Great Again” to “Make America GOPe Again.”It’s clear that Trump believes that the agenda that got him elected  — anti-immigration, anti-interventionism and pro-American trade polices — is dead letter. It has virtually no support from those in power: either party in Congress, the permanent government and the vast majority of his own administration. Hell, his own family has no interest in it.All that is left for him is a vanity project and “securing his legacy,” and the only way to do that is to win a second term, and he seems hell-bent on doing this as a standard-issue Republican, and most importantly, with establishment Republican money rather than his own, either because he can’t fund another campaign or simply won’t. In 2016 he had no choice, but this year he can tap, and already is tapping, into the GOPe donor well.His calculus almost certainly is that the votes he loses from the disillusioned believers in his MAGA agenda will be more than made up for by grug-brained, Fox News listening Republicans who simply want to win regardless of the agenda. He may be right. Count me out though…

            I never expected much of President Trump at least in his first term. My assumption was that he wanted to leave an America where the kind of enterprises his family is involved in could function and that was his legacyThis meant using the right words to get elected and having policies that would have some small benefit for Americans in the pocket bookHe did these things and more importantly shifted the Overton window our wayIts not enough to make him great yet  or to actually Make America Great Again but its better than nothing and he might manage a bit more in his second term.Now as for our leaders, the big money that pulls their strings wants things far different than what we want and money always talksThis may make the TINVOWOOT meme entirely true but so be it. Instead of quoth ObamaThey get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.Maybe they should take the Former Presidents entirely accurate words to heart , lay off the Despair  Oxy , Meth and Weed and grow up. No collapse , no  zombie apocalypse is going to save you,  no one else isn’t going to save you but you and your matesYou want power for your ends  you don’t  beg for power. You take it . Once you know what you want . Try elections, try running for office first that’s my advice to everybodyIf that fails, maybe when that fails , make some friends with common goals who also  realize that what  those 1.3 million semi auto rifles y’all bought last year are for.Don’t be like most Americans, all guns, no guts

                Shifted the Overton Window? People are not just being deplatformed for expressing heterodox opinions, they are being de-banked and blackballed from the job market. Nice to know it’s all going to come good in the second term though. Now I can go back to plan-trusting…

        The blockchain offers the tech to continue the USA from an alternative timeline, say that ended in 1890, which bypasses the Social Democracy of the last 86 years or so.The problem in the USA has been the advent of Social Democracy, i.e., positive rights, and the erasure of a government based on negative rights.“They owe me a better life” (positive rights) vs “They have duty not to harm me” (negative rights) — that has been the great battle for the last 100 years. The decline has come from the Social Democrats winning.That is what progressivism is all about. Progressivism has only ever meant to turn the USA into a social democracy of positive rights.In law, when someone has a positive right, that one is entitled to an advantage paid by lawgivers who of course borrow and fund borrowing with taxes.Under republicanism, which the USA no longer has, citizens had negative rights — the individual was entitled to the present position of things, to be free from acts that harm him. That included being free from politicians trying to tax him in unfettered fashion so they could then fund social democracy positive rights.Until people start talking about jurisprudence concepts of property (right of ownership) in self, chattel, works, promises and of positive rights (others owe me a better life, e.g., UBI) versus negative rights (I have the right to be left alone), little will change.The decline to collapse is inevitable as social democracy grows.

            Social democracy involves the loss of personal agency.  The giving up of personal control over various aspects of your life never ends well.  Those you give your agency to, never fail to treat it with less care than you do.  Giving up agency gives others the power to make you expendable.  Keep that in mind next time you are offered UBI or universal health care.

        It used to be that when the intergroup friction in the west got too intense, the groups fought it out and/or one decamped to a new territory.  TPTB will not allow a fight and there is no where left to flee.  Even rural “nobody wants to live here” Montana has Lon Horiuchi.  If the enemy can use 1984 and Anthem as how-to guides, why can’t we use Elysium as ours?  New political philosophy usually comes from fiction, and it appears after exhaustive review that there is nothing new under the sun. Since we cannot go out, we go up, literally or figuratively.  The new society will be very literally walled off from any diversity, and protected by automation and insurmountable barriers. Warfare by numbers requires high walls, warfare by technology requires thick walls.  Maybe the future is a very high, thin version of the Berlin Wall, but manned by AI with its own machine guns and rocket launchers, around every nation’s insular territory. Nations will be small, but that sounds like a feature not a bug.

        For my part, I hope to modernize religion into the science it’s trying to be.  You good people are better at the real world stuff, I defer to you for that.
The good news is, there are actual answers to the Eternal Questions, to the point of how big, how tall, etc., and that the white peoples are the ones to answer those questions.
General Epiminondas, I disagree.This is the Zman’s most important post- not “who are we?”, but, “where must we go?”

        “Everyone in the West has extra of all the things that matter and extra of most of the luxury items.”
Well… pretty much everyone is still dead before his hundredth birthday.
And, most people nowadays of European descent do not think that the reward for dying is that they get to go up to Heaven and play on a harp with Jesus.
As Boomers all start to realize how close they are to dying, this is likely to become a bit more salient.
I suspect the Chinese may already be thinking about this…
