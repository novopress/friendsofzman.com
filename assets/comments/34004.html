        Not just the “disparate impact” order–I’m (sadly) certain that every one of Trump’s executive orders will be reversed on January 21, 2029.

        Witch-hunting: I learnt this week that James VI and I, a keen persecutor of witches, changed his mind. He decided that the women were not bad, merely mad.  He set up a research project at Cambridge to investigate their delusions.
Can anyone suggest an American president who had a similar, public, change of heart?

        A bit of pedanticism on the religion thing, Derb. Yes, Islam has conquered by the sword, but it’s a bit more complicated than “If you don’t accept Allah and his Prophet, we’ll kill you.” Quite the opposite — Muslim empires allow for infidels to worship their religions as long as they accept dhimmitude and pay the jizya tax to the Muslim rulers.And as far as the universalism of Christianity, yes, that it true, but Christianity has historically spread by evangelizing and doing missionary work, not by demanding that nations accept millions for foreigners. I don’t think St. Paul’s “neither Jew nor Greek” statement should be interpreted in terms of political borders, but rather that both Jews and Greeks who accept Jesus can be admitted to Heaven.Christianity is transpolitical. Unlike the political religion of the Jews, in which Israel is the political fulfillment of the Mosaic Covenant for God’s Chosen tribe only, Christianity’s reward for all believers is in the hereafter.

            The simple truth is that liberals and egalitarians have latched onto a snippet in the Bible and grossly pulled it out of context in that common and pathetic way people try to rebrand respectable things into support of their typically reprobate thing.Galatians 3:28 should never be read outside of verses 26-29. It does not apply to non-Christians, and verse 28 should be understood as saying that there is no hierarchy within the elect because all of the elect are using the identity of Jesus Christ to claim their position as child of God and heir to Abraham.Christianity is universalist in that all can join the fraternity if they bend the knee to Jesus Christ, but it is highly exclusionary to those that do not (no marriage, “expel the evil from among you”). Furthermore, natural hierarchies and organizational divisions are maintained and respected. A proper understanding of the Old Testament, as opposed to people lifting whatever suits their preconceptions, means that people accept that:1) A new creation requires division.2) A division of people into nations is a precondition for a Christian nation, the Christian Church and the coming of the Kingdom of God.3) Healthy organisms maintain internal divisions (Tribes of Israel, special role of the Levites and line of David, ergo nations within the Church fraternity).4) Christian nations are highly exclusionary along spiritual lines. Although the concept of the fringe and its place in society is maintained, and some outside things can be brought inside through purification.You will know the return of a proper Christian nation when it vigorously excludes 3rd World pagans who cannot even respect the 10 Commandments. What we have today are nations and official “Church” organizations that are temples to Secular Liberalism. The old Christian trappings are maintained to provide the veneer of divine moral authority even as that veneer is shed because Secular Liberalism and Christianity are not compatible.The growing crisis of Secular Liberalism is that it has no internal mechanisms of authority or self preservation. “Who says?” as our host is fond of asking. The misappropriation of Christianity’s divine moral authority through abuse of scripture and co-opting of official organizations is the only way for Secular Liberalism to exist at all.To modify and clarify what has already been said.

        The bogus “legal” theory of Disparate Impact serves to harm Whites and to benefit mentally defective Negros. That is its main purpose. It also promotes litigation &amp; lawfare, thereby inflating the income of parasite-lawyers. It has nolegaljustification, only apoliticalone. That our judicial system (including the Supreme Court) should have foisted this absurd concept on our country demonstrates once again the ideological agenda of leftwing judges. They serve as politicalcommissars, not as judges.Good for President Trump for his recent EO“eliminating disparate-impact theory from civil rights analysis and enforcement and restoring colorblind meritocracy to that zone.”It can be reversed, however, by the next Democrat president, or possibly even by the next Democrat majority in Congress. Therefore, the only solution is to keep the Democrats out. The Democratic Party is the Evil Party. They are “woke” – decadent, effeminate, treasonous and anti-White.

        Re trumps first hundred days. I haven’t been paying attention to the news, except the price of gold for some reason. But this is still a liberal democracy which means  forces no one can see is running things. There is no hope  if there is still a constitution and rule of law and the will of muh the people all that other gay stuff.
does that sound too cynical?

            Proper degree of cynicism:
Trump wants to do a lot of things, mostly good and some very bad. You can tell which are which by whether the government obeys him. To his credit, it rarely does. And it occasionally shoots him in the face.
That “civil war” dork Derb has mentioned a couple times (Benz? approximately) was sent out on his weird podcast stuttering junket to tell us that the regime has decided it’s time to makeits resistance to usphysical. “Touch me and see what happens.”

        THE Grand Lodge of Italy of the Ancient, Free, Accepted Masons joins in the universal mourning for the passing of Pope Francis , a pastor who, with his teaching and his life, embodied the values ​​ofbrotherhood , humility and the search for a planetary humanism .Coming from the “end of the world”, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was able to change the Church, bringing the revolutionary teaching of Saint Francis of Assisi back to the present of history.In this moment of mourning, our Communion intends to pay homage to the vision of Pope Francis , whose work is characterized by a profound resonance with the principles of Freemasonry : the centrality of the person, respect for the dignity of each individual, the construction of a supportive community, the pursuit of the common good . His encyclical Fratelli tutti represents a manifesto.Freedom, Equality and Brotherhood is the triple value asset of Freemasonry.Overcoming divisions, ideologies, single thought to recognize the richness of differences and build a humanity united in diversity , this is what Francis ardently wanted, the same plan is pursued by the Grand Lodge of Italy.”

        Christianity, however, is explicitly universalist. Saint Paul told us that,quote: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.”no wonder the church forbid the mass printing of the Bible. The Bible can only be interpreted by the church. It’s a document of the church. The authority of the church pointed at certain books and said, because we were founded by god, we have the authoriy to say those books were inspired by god.since thte church is in a crisis noe (I can’t give you the names or addresses of any living bishop) the teaching office is not giving us documents. But so you understand that the church has never promoted filthy race mixing or racial pluralistic societies I’ll give you a few quotes.what people seem to miss in this quote by St. Paul is that that it is giving real human categories. Two are forever immutable one difficult to change. You can never change your race or your sex. But conservatives miss this. They are the neither Jew nor Greek and start squawking about universalism. Well what about sex? Now his says there’s no sex differences? They totally miss that. Now the slave and free is mutable I guess but don’t really think Paul was trying to say you could change your race or sex becauece it’s possible to buy your freedom if your a slave? DumbSt. Augustine on Galatians 3:28:• Difference of race or condition or sex is indeed taken away by the unity of faith, but it remains embedded in our mortal interactions, and in the journey of this life the apostles themselves teach that it is to be respected… For we observe in the unity of faith that there are no such distinctions. Yet within the orders of this life they persist.*[Regarding marriages between whites and Negroes] That there are lines between classes of people is a certainty that may as well be acknowledged at once, and the color-line is one of them. While it is entirely possible to ignore these lines, the social effect of such action is seldom happy. Just as a member of the true Church is earnestly dissuaded from marriage, by dispensation, with a non-member, so should a member of one race be dissuaded from marriage with a person of another color. In marriages of either type, there is a definite injustice done to children, there are almost inevitable misunderstandings between the parties themselves, and there is sure to be some friction between the families so gracelessly united.-Glenn’s Class Manuals in Philosophy, Sociology, (1941), pg. 372“From the Church’s point of view there is no objection whatever to racial research and race culture. Nor is there any objection to the endeavour to keep the national characteristics of a people as far as possible pure and unadulterated, and to foster their national spirit by emphasis upon the common ties of blood-which unite them. From the Church’s point of view we must make only three conditions: First, love of one’s own race must not lead to the hatred of other nations. Secondly, the individual must never consider himself freed from the obligation of nourishing his own soul by the persevering use of the means of grace which the Church provides. The young man who is always hearing about the blessedness of his own race is apt too easily to conceive that he is no longer bound by duties to God and His Church, duties of humility and chastity. Thirdly, race culture must not assume an attitude of hostility to Christianity,”Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber-Judaism, Christianity, and Germany, Third Question: What is the relation of Christianity to the German Race?, Pg. 107Pope Pius XI..however necessary and honorable be their function [race, the people, and the state] in worldly things – whoever raises these notions above their standard value and divinizes them to an idolatrous level, distorts and perverts an order of the world planned and created by God.”“No one would think of preventing young Germans establishing a true ethnical community in a noble love of freedom and loyalty to their country.”– Papal Encyclical, Mitt Brennender Sorge, to the German Hierarchy, nn. 8 &amp; 34Pope Pius XII**The Church of Jesus Christ…is the repository of His wisdom; she is certainly too wise to discourage or belittle those peculiarities and differences which mark out one nation from another. It is quite legitimate for nations to treat those differences as a sacred inheritance and guard them at all costs.The Church aims at unity, a unity determined and kept alive by that supernatural love which should be actuating everybody; she does not aim at a uniformity which would only be external in its effects and would cramp the natural tendencies of the nations concerned. Every nation has its own genius, its own qualities, springing from the hidden roots of its being. The wise development, the encouragement within limits, of that genius, those qualities, does no harm; and if a nation cares to take precautions, to lay down rules, for that end, it has the Church’s approval. She is mother enough to befriend such projects with her prayers provided that they are not opposed to the duties incumbent on men from their common origin and shared destiny.”-Papal Encyclical, Summi Pontificatus, to the Universal Church, AAS 31(1939) 428-29St. John ChrysostomDoctor of the Church*And so says Isaiah, the chief of the Prophets, You shall not overlook your kinsmen of your own seed. Isaiah 58:7, Septuagint For if a man deserts those who are united by ties of kindred and affinity, how shall he be affectionate towards others? Will it not have the appearance of vainglory, when benefiting others he slights his own relations, and does not provide for them? And what will be said, if instructing others, he neglects his own, though he has greater facilities; and a higher obligation to benefit them?Will it not be said, These Christians are affectionate indeed, who neglect their own relatives? He is worse than an infidel. Wherefore? Because the latter, if he benefits not aliens, does not neglect his near kindred. What is meant is this: The law of God and of nature is violated by him who provides not for his own family… It was the design of God, in uniting us by the ties of kindred, to afford us many opportunities of doing good to one another…Because it is not the same thing to neglect our kindred, as to neglect a stranger. How should it be? But the fault is greater here, to desert one known than one who is unknown to us, a friend than one who is not a friend.”-Commentary on 1 Timothy 5:8, “But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.”*The existence of distinct races is nowhere denied…Neither would the assertion that these races differ among themselves fall under the condemnation, because if they exist it follows that there must be diversity in order that they bedistinguishable at all. In addition the acknowledgement of this difference is common enough in Church documents. Nor do the words “by their innate … character” cause difficulty, because races are essentially groups constituted by heredity, whose qualities in so far as they are racial must be congenital. This fact is likewise acknowledged by the catholic hierarchy.”*It is worth recalling, before this discussion is concluded, the remark made earlier to the effect that this proposition does not rule out the possibility of a limited and accidental gradation of races. Because such a relative superiority and inferiority would not as such destroy the unity of mankind. Nor does it seem to be incompatible with the Church’s teaching concerning the general equality of all men.”-Race, Reflections of Theologian,Rev. Fr. Bonaventure HinwoodO.F.M.Pgs. 74-76St. Thomas AquinasUniversal and Angelic Doctor“For it pertains to the statesman to know how large a city should be and whether it should include men of one race or of several. The size of the city should indeed be such that the region may be sufficiently productive and that it may be possible to repel external enemies. It should also preferably be made up of a single race in view of the fact that the men of the same race possess the same way of life and the same customs, which foster friendship among the citizens because of their resemblance. Accordingly, the cities that were constituted out of different races were ruined on account of the dissensions that arose in them due to the diversity of manners, for one part used to ally itself with [externall enemies out of hatred for the other part.”-Commentary on Aristotle’s Polities, Bk. II, Ch. II
