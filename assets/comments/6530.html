        “If the GOP signs off on Obama appointing another justice, the party is finished”From your lips to God’s ears on this score because there is no surer bet than the GOP confirming anyone Obama decides to appoint.  The odds against the sun rising again in the East again tomorrow are much higher than the odds against the GOP caving and putting Obama’s pick on the Court.  Maybe Mitch can schedule a vote in favor of amnesty and starting another war in Middle East on the same day as the confirmation vote just to drive home how much concern the GOP has for the wishes of their voters.

        Maybe it is time for the sclerotic GOP to go away and have a more vigorous party take its place.  The Democrats should be careful what they wish for.  And McConnell and Ryan can find out what it is like to be despised by those they have pretended to “serve”.Trump has really shown the way here.  Get out there and take no prisoners.  Argue policy and political philosophy all you want, but there is something to be said for the “man the torpedoes, full speed ahead” approach.  I believe that the mantle will be picked up by others, and there should be some interesting times ahead.

        “The Scottish Nationalist Party eviscerated the Lib-Dems and Labour”Labour + LibDems + SNP did not win a majority of the seats. The Conservatives did. This was a vote for what passes for the right. Nothing accidental about it.But I do agree that the Conservatives would do well to encourage people to vote out of the EU or at least to be neutral about it.

        Cameron played his hand early in the last election, saying that if he was elected again he would hold an in/out  referendum. That gave him some votes and significantly enough breathing space to negotiate with the EU to come up with a deal that would allow him to say “Hey, peasants, we have fixed Europe.”But Merkel has repeatedly said “Nein” and now Cameron looks feeble, more so when one of Merkel’s top henchmen has said the EU will make war on Britain’s trade. As they already have made war on Britain’ laws, this should come as no surprise.So Cameron, and you are right here, Z, now has no credibility; the ‘deal’ he brokered was no more than a vague possibility that the EU might, maybe, perhaps will look at some piddling aspect of its ways. With this failure, the Tories have all but disappeared into insignificance and already the prospects of a referendum are looking doubtful. Why ask the people what they think when even the elected leader of the UK has no power to change anything with the unelected bureaucrats but, more importantly, the EU will not allow the UK to leave. I mean, imagine join a club which neither wants you nor will allow you to resign. Yes, that was what we managed to do in the ‘seventies.Someone said the other day that after so long there is no way the UK parliament will want to rewrite nearly 40 years of laws to take out the European demands, and no MP in Westminster will want to put the work in. Right now the UK parliament merely rubber stamps what Brussels says, so it is an easy job. If Britain somehow left — and as I say it will not be allowed as votes can be recounted, rejected or faked — then the poor MPs will have to put some extra hours in.Hmmm, not going to happen.

            One of the things I find fascinating about the ongoing crises is how the people in charge keep making unforced errors. The EU just had to throw Cameron a couple of bones and he would be able to do his Neville Chamberlain act and fool enough voters to seal the deal. Then they could quietly renege on whatever deal he negotiated with the EU and no one could do anything about it.Instead, the EU is emasculating their ally for no reason that I can see. If Cameron cancels the referendum he is finished and his party will see its voters stomp off to UKIP. If they hold the thing, voting for Brexit becomes a way to voice displeasure with Cameron.

                Maybe the Germans feel that after crushing Greece, they can dictate terms throughout the EU.  You gotta admit, that’s been the national modus operandi since Bismarck stepped down.

                            A better take is, in penance for 1946. Merkel is an unreconstructed East German Communist, if the Soviets taught the East Germans anything, it was to hate their own country. The Germans can’t seem to punish themselves enough for that war. It would be refreshing to see them take their own side again.

                I don’t think anyone will vote for a Brexit to spite Cameron.Europe is already annoyed that Britain got away with keeping the pound instead of adopting the euro.They hate that Britain isn’t getting with the program. They believe in being inflexible. Their popularity has always been low and they’ve made it this far so they intend to carry on. Besides, I don’t think that polls show the majority of the British want to leave the EU so why should they take it seriously? And the Conservatives have already made clear they don’t want to leave, so again, from the EU’s point of view, why give in?What’s funny is that when the muslim tsunami happened last year, I heard Merkel say Europe has to be united in the face of this crisis and I instinctively thought she meant Europe must unite to keep them all out. I was thrilled. At last, I thought, the EU will do something good!

                And in other news, Sec State admits that Europe faces an“existential crisis”due to immigration.  Based on the difference between the article URL and headline, I’m pretty sure the editors cleaned it up to tamp down on fears. Two steps forward, one step back!

        Well, at least we’ll see if Donald Trump is at all serious about winning the election (I still find it hard to believe he and Bernie are serious.  They’re not even trying!).  If he’s serious, he’ll find the most radical strict-constructionist in America, a dude that got kicked out of the Federalist Society for having too many tattoos of John C. Calhoun.  Talkhimup as his first Supreme Court nominee, and he’ll cruise to the Presidency.

                I had the same thought, but if Cruz were smart in that scenario, he’d turn that into “why put me on the Supreme Court when you can give me the biggest chair?”  But yeah — a strict constructionist over an evangelical all the way, but if he could find a strict constructionist evangelical….  But don’t worry: the GOP will “forget” to hold pro-forma sessions, letting Obama appoint a paralyzed transsexual lesbian of color in recess.

        This bears repeating:
“Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which permit this norm to be exceeded — here and there, now and then — are the work of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a society, the people then slip back into abject poverty.
This is known as “bad luck.”

Zman, have you seen the recent Coen brothers movie, “Inside Llewyn Davis”? It is a wonderful 2-hour elaboration on this theme. One of their best movies, IMO– and they have made a lot of great movies.
