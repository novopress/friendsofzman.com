        Say what you will about Joe Biden, but he loves his kids‚Ä¶I have to disagree with that one when it comes to Hunter. Joe‚Äôs favorite child, the one Joe had chosen as his successor, was Beau. Hunter was the embarrassment, the unloved one who turned into the piece of human garbage he is because of his monstrous father favoring the son who died, who he constantly talks about, instead of him. Make no mistake, if it benefited Joe, Hunter would be in jail, because the son he loved died years ago. Hunter is expendable. Pardoning him is less about protecting his crack addled degenerate son, but protecting himself and a giant middle finger to everyone, because when Joe Biden remembers who he is and was, he will happily screw everyone who crossed him, because the old bastard was famous as a vindictive, mean, petty asshole when he still had his marbles.

            The pettiness of that old man is amusing. His dementia seems to stave off when scheming to screw over people. Not the best thing for a man about to meet his maker, but at least he can make us laugh.

                Hunter sure ‚Äúloved‚Äù his dead brother‚Äôs Jewish wife, LOL.
But the apples don‚Äôt fall far from the tree. Old Joe started banging Jill (who was quite hot back in the day) when she was married to a dude who was contributing to his Senate campaign, and she volunteered to work for the campaign.
What a bunch of real upstanding people.

                    Hunter is just following ancient Jewish practice:
‚ÄùThe ancient Jewish practice of a brother marrying his deceased brother‚Äôs widow is known as levirate marriage (from the Latinlevir, meaning ‚Äúbrother-in-law‚Äù). This practice is outlined in the Torah, specifically in Deuteronomy 25:5-10. It was intended to preserve the deceased brother‚Äôs lineage and inheritance by allowing the widow to have children in his name.‚Äù

                            I doubt Hunter has the slightest idea about Jewish custom.
On the other hand, I do not doubt that, assuming Beau‚Äôs wife is Jewish, that she understands it. Or that she could manipulate a crackhead into following Jewish law, even though he was clueless.
Westerners are so clueless about how other cultures function‚Ä¶

            Joe loves Hunter, but understood his limitations and destructive tendencies and knew Hunter could never successfully run for public office.  Beau was the one who had his act together and could have taken over for Joe.  Once he ‚Äúdied in Iraq‚Äù all that Joe could do was use Hunter as a cut out to get bribe money, still useful to Joe, but not the same.

                    Biden frequently brought up Beau‚Äôs death in a cynical attempt to get sympathy from voters. He usually said Beau died in Iraq when in reality he died from cancer caused in part from chemical exposure he had while serving there years later.

            Joe put the knife to the Dem aristocracy when he selected Kamala and then submarined her campaign. The Pelosi coup conspiratorswere obviously plotting revenge via his lifelong history of corruption, and very likely Hunter was in the crosshairs as payback.¬†The pardon was thus intended as another FU to those who deposed him in August. It‚Äôs revenge all the way down.

                Yes.  It‚Äôs been fun watching the Dem‚Äôs Knives Out fiesta since the Biden debate fiasco.  First Obama/Pelosi/NYT piling on to demand Joe suicide himself, peaking with the George Clooney (!?!) NYT Op Ed.  Poor George, no Italian Ambassador appointment for you!Then when the hit men are sent that fateful weekend in Delaware to force his hand, Joe/Jill snap right back with the Kamala endorsement to the shock and horror of the plotters.  No, not her!  Worst candidate ever!  But he stuck them with her.Rage and revenge seem to really sharpen what‚Äôs left of Joe‚Äôs mind.  His regime really did seem to go put of its way to undermine the already feeble Kamala candidacy.I had thought the icing on this cake was Biden‚Äôs  obvious pleasure meeting with Trump after the election.  So pleasant when an evil plan comes together.But this pardon, well analyzed by our host, does cap the climax.  It looks not so much like a simple pardon as Executive Clemency, and the model was Ford/Nixon.  What that means is Hunter doesn‚Äôt face liability for anything Federal so he can‚Äôt plead the Fifth if forced to testify before Congress or against others.  Unlike Nixon he was just a private citizen and can‚Äôt claim executive privilege etc.  So the entire evil cabal must be pooping masonry.We‚Äôre in for a wild ride.  But the odds of Trump surviving to the inauguration just went down

            A comprehensive audit of the Ukraine grift would show Republicans like McConnell got comparative crumbs (millions vs. tens of millions), but given how the GOP allegedly negotiates on everything else, that itself was a triumph for them. The same probably took place with the Covid plunder, which likely was far larger. Like with the Keating Five and John McCain, there will be Republican shoplifters implicated along with the Democratic bank robbers if the ledger books ever have to be produced. The Help and the Hos never had it better and will be sad to see it end. It is small wonder they destroyed what little remained of the rotten edifice of the Global American Empire on their way out the door.

            This and most (not all) of the replies are why I propose we drop the R from DR. We can‚Äôt wait for the Ls to make the case against the nominal R. We seem to have this crazy notion that if we foul our own side, we win. Yas, yas, McConjobet al. were eating too, but at the kid‚Äôs table. Rs are more than happy to throw ‚Äútheir own‚Äù under the bus, something you will never see from the Ls.

        ‚ÄúIf the 2014 start date seems important, that is because it is when the Biden family started feeding at the Ukraine trough.‚Äù
Ukraine is the rosetta stone of what this government is about; cia coups; political slushfunds and kickbacks, and sending millions into a meatgrinder war against Russia for the crime of being Christian, not anal, and opposing global financier domination.

            It‚Äôs theothercountry‚Äîvery, very like us‚Äîwhose population the regime uses as cattle.2014 is when it was decided to kill them all (or when that decision was made visible). It‚Äôs tempting to say they‚Äôre ‚Äúculling the herd‚Äù but that‚Äôs killing as ameans, so it doesn‚Äôt fit. The stolen money and land, corruption (misc.), etc., is what‚Äôs incidental. Death is achance to do it, like impulsively rooting through the purse of a hooker you just strangled. You‚Äôre not a robber, you‚Äôre a sex killer, but there it is on the floor, pulled half open as she reached for it‚Ä¶2020 is when they decided to do it to us (visibly).Neil Oliver credits his wife with the insight that everything terrible since 2016 is the global regime punishing the natives of the West for ‚ÄúBrexit and Trump.‚Äù True enough. That was a big symbolic moment, the time when theaverageleftist‚Äîthe mere professional, the mere voter‚Äîturned genocidal. But what happens isn‚Äôt up to them.And we weren‚Äôt first. Nor were the Ukrainians (RIP).

Your written imagery is fantastic and uncanny. One problem with the above excerpt, though, is the pronoun ‚Äúshe.‚Äù It‚Äôs more John Wayne Gacy than Ted Bundy. Otherwise it is perfect.

        The pardon is not nearly as problematic as the fact that Hunter was basically being bribed by Ukraine. His father then gave billions to Ukraine not only for military aid, but to bankroll the entire Ukrainian government, yetthe entire Washington establishment was totally blas√© about itThe fact that Biden was completely given a pass on this by the Left and the media andis simply incredible.I remember what things were like in the 1970s‚Ä¶ imagine what the reaction would have been if Tricia Nixon had been a drug addict and she was paid millions to be put on the board of directors of the Vietnamese State Oil and Gas Company, and then Dick escalated the war and increased funding to Vietnam‚Ä¶

                    It actually could have the opposite effect. In a federal conspiracy case against Joe Biden, Hunter could be compelled to testify since self-incrimination would be impossible. It is why I expect Daddy Biden will pardon himself and his brother James, and/or Hunter will dine pretty soon at the Jack Ruby Cafe. There has been massive and unprecedented theft since those in the capitol of the Banana Empire decided to plunder the peasants under the guise of propping up non-existent democracy in the Ukraine, so nothing probably can happen even if the cowards able to force the issue grow a pair. Someone has to keep the money printers going ‚Äúbrrrr‚Äù and the EBT cards filled.

        What astounds me is that among all the hue and cry, nobody suggest that the presidential pardon makes a mockery of the American judicial system, that it‚Äôs just naked, unabashed clientelism.
Sort of the same attitude to presidents routinely employing family member in key cabinet positions, and that being related to a president is a legitimate political reason why you have a good shot at becoming the future POTUS.

                    Diversity is antithetical to civilization. As Europe follows the Blackberry Fruitcake Empire‚Äôs descent into the diverse abyss, it will come to know more of the joys of murder, rape, filth, ugliness, mistrust and social dysfunction. But it‚Äôs already getting a taste of rape and murder, most frequently, it seems, during local diversity jubilees.

            I like the presidential pardon, it‚Äôs like this vestige of monarchy that they put in the Constitution. I just wish Trump used it on people who were unjustly punished by the regime under his watch, as opposed to crooked Jewish criminals and degenerate rappers.

            The ‚Äúexecutive pardon‚Äù is a (antiquated) continuation of the Divine Right of Kings‚Äîthe King being the law so to speak.  It extends to the level of the States here in the USA and their Governors as well.  However, some States have sought to limit this power a bit by running such *first* through a Clemency Board.  The Board being in charge of recommending such pardon.I‚Äôm not for eliminating this executive power, but it definitely needs to be restructured in light of the modern abuse of such at the Federal level. The breaking point will be the first President to pardon ‚Äúhimself‚Äù.  Biden might yet prove interesting.

                Well, the system itself is an offense to the Western notion of justice, is my point, so pardoning as much as a parking ticket is abuse. Arbitrary pardoning crime is as bad as arbitrary enforcement.
But there‚Äôs Marc Rich, as Z mentions, and there‚Äôs Trump pardoning that Jewish meat packing guy, that was pretty brazen too.

                    I‚Äôm not so sure. There should have been some way of negating the atrocity that was visited upon Alex Jones by an out-of-control judiciary. Or attorneys being disbarred because they represent people who questioned the election. In practice, there really isn‚Äôt, but because of the difference in wording between the 1st and 2nd, a good case can be made for pardoning everyone being punished for at least non-violent ‚Äúgun crime‚Äù.Yes, I was having trouble coming up with any troublesome pardons before Clinton, too. Well, Nixon. As@Compscipoints out, Ford should have waited for Dems to squander political capital and money pressing charges, then pardoned him.

                            Like@JackDobson implies, the appellate courts are often filled not by people who intend to apply the law, but rather make it. Different states have different ways of filling the judiciary and the appellate, but generally speaking, a leftist state is going to end up with a leftist judiciary, top to bottom. This includes the federal level, which is why the 9th Circuit is such a disaster. Which is also why attorneys tend to jurisdiction-shop for somewhere likely to rule in their favor.

                            That is precisely what such power it is designed to do.  There are also implied powers under the Constitution which allow commutation of sentences and pardons after the fact,  This corrects certain judicial ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù.  Your analysis implies that there is no such thing as a judicial mistake since there is an appellate court process.  Doubtful.  Appellate courts can get it wrong as well.

                                My point was that there will always be miscarriages of justice, no matter what or who you put on top of the appellate system, or how many layers you put on it.
But when you have an option that arbitrarily circumvents the whole system, and that option depends on some politician‚Äôs judgement call rather than law and procedure, you inevitably invite abuse.
Right now, Oprah Winfrey, in connivance with Kim Kardashian and various true crime-podcasters, are busy pressuring elected officials to get black murderers who only killed white people sprung from jail, and making big bank on the grift.

                        The proper procedure should‚Äôve been that Congress passed a law.
And while the court system may be defective, adding an arbitrary number of arbitrary get-out-of-jail-free-cards to the system doesn‚Äôt fix it, because the buck has to stop somewhere.

        I would say it was nice of Hunter to take all the heat off of the Pelosi, Kerry, and Romney children who also sat on the boards of Ukrainian gas companies, but it turns out he was never in any danger, so it wasn‚Äôt exactly selfless on his part.
Trump, having first pardoned and now nominated Charles Kushner, possesses no moral authority to denounce any of this.

            Did you see Trump named Chuckie Ambassador to France? I would say that shamelessness knows no party, except, as Z put it over the weekend, it is so hilariously insulting to the French.

        President Biden‚Äôs pardon of son Hunter isn‚Äôt so much a revelation of leftist hypocrisy as it is an indication of paranoia about possible cracks in the system. After years of ruthless lawfare against Trump and his acolytes, might some Republican placeholders be angry enough to actually go after a bit of the lawlessness and self-dealing among the nomenklatura? Contrast this with Murkowskie and her Republican Senate colleagues‚Äô refusal to confirm Trump nominees not on good terms with the FBI. This reads like the usual boob-bate for constituents, but also demonstrates a reliance on the system to keep themselves out of jail‚Äîwhich in fairness has worked well for Hunteret aliaup until now.

            He could be excused for not pardoning the ones convicted of assaulting officers, but otherwise, I can‚Äôt excuse his not pardoning a single one. Not even the ‚Äúseditious conspiracy‚Äù convicts. But sometimes Trump surprises to the upside, so maybe he‚Äôll pardon the ‚Äúviolent‚Äù ones too. I wouldn‚Äôt complain.
There are definitely no excuses for reaching close of business on Jan. 22 without any of this happening.

                I think he needs to work on prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutors and judged denied defense access to exculpatory evidence at all, let alone in a timely fashion. Impeachment and imprisonment in genpop at the very least for their malicious prosecution, abuse of rules, and willful violation of due process.
Put the Civil Rights division of DOJ on something real instead of investigating imaginary redlining.

        Sam dixon and Marc Weber talk about loyalty and America. Most Americans think of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù as their parents or their children and maybe their first cousins. Lower class whites live more around the extended family so that could include second cousins but everyone else is the same: a Somalian is equal to a your next door neighbor.so old joe being loyal is not so impressive to me. Where is the loyalty to one‚Äôs people. Neither conservative nor liberal have this.there is no we in America so it‚Äôs impossible to be loyal to anyone but your immediate family. I think it was Cato who watched his own son convicted of treason and put the good of the whole state above his son; Socrates too refused to flee at crios insistence as it would undermine the city and her laws.this is also the problem with the ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù . It‚Äôs all about me and financial success. Not honor. I‚Äôm guilty of it too, but it‚Äôs an place:shine on, perishing republic

            Not bad points, but the tendency to put your thumb on the scale for family members is worldwide. Maybe it‚Äôs to varying degrees depending on the culture, but at this point in the history of our world, nobody‚Äôs going to put ‚Äúthe state‚Äù before a family member except maybe the ‚Äúit takes a village‚Äù people.
That‚Äôs also what was infuriating about W. Bush. I think Cheney tried to get Scooter Liddy a pardon. Everybody knows Liddy was railroaded, yet Bush‚Äôs loyalty remained to the institutions of government, even as corrupt as they are.

        Without wading into whether prospective crimes without charges or convictions can be legitimately pardoned (they seemingly can be), look for ol‚Äô Joe and his brother James also to receive Get out of Jail Free cards if his D.C. shysters can devise a theory to allow it. There may be others who were involved in the Ukraine grift who also receive these if they pony up enough for the Joe Biden Presidential Library. Those will happen on the last day Biden spends in his White House Old Folks Home. Bargain Basement Ukraine grifters like the Brothers Vinman probably will be left holding the bag.

            It seems like he is giving Hunter blanket immunity. I did not think the president had the power to give immunity at that scale. I was under the impression there needed to be a conviction for a crime for there to be a pardon. It seems I do not know much.

                The tradition is that specific charges, specific people, or a person-charge class (draft dodgers, fugitive slaves) can be pardoned. A ‚Äúblanket pardon‚Äù for a well-connected criminal isn‚Äôt unusual (anymore). But, e.g., Trump couldn‚Äôt pardon the January 6 people while he was in office because they were unknown persons charged with unknown offenses (I‚Äôm sure he was told).
Of course none of that istrue. The law is: Some people can do whatever they want, and some can‚Äôt do anything. Politics is those categories being sorted.

        ‚ÄúThe public no longer believes any of it now and the people doing the point and shriek are running out of energy.‚ÄùWell, kind of.  I think most of ‚Äúthe public‚Äù knew it was b.s. and went along with it because you‚Äôre supposed to cheer for the home team.  Same with the various hoaxes and the fake election in 2020.  The country has been in two camps for awhile now ‚Äì those who know it‚Äôs all b.s. and want something done about it vs. those who know it‚Äôs all b.s. but they‚Äôre happy with the result.  The Ends Justify the Means coalition is impervious to charges of hypocrisy for this reason.  They simply don‚Äôt care as long as they perceive the result is bad for whomever they‚Äôve decided is their enemy today.The reason the response has been so muted post-election isn‚Äôt fatigue.  That‚Äôs only a small part of it.  What it really is equates to the Ukraine situation ‚Äì there simply aren‚Äôt any munitions left in the stockpiles.  They shot EVERYTHING at Trump from corrupt state prosecutions to corrupt federal indictments to actual bullets.  They ran the obscenest gaslighting operation in world history and spent (by some estimates) as much as $2B in 10 weeks.  What did they get?  GOP control of Congress, Trump wins not just the EC but the NPV.They have nothing to shoot at Trump.  Look at the feckless protests about his nominees.  Sure, they got Gaetz‚Äôs scalp, but if you don‚Äôt want your scalp taken in D.C., maybe don‚Äôt write out personal checks to hookers.  The rest of the transition complaints are recycled 2016 complaints about ‚Äúchaos‚Äù which people just laugh at now.  You can only cry ‚ÄúWolf!‚Äù so many times.And here we are less than a month after the election and what are we already seeing:Mexico caving on the borderCanada freaking out about border enforcementBRICS under direct assault by Trump ‚Äì no trade with USA for BRICS nations would wreck them; China now talking about avoiding purchase of Iranian oilEveryone now talking about how to end the Ukraine war ‚Äì despite the limp-d*ck missile launchesA Hezbollah/Israel cease fire; movement towards ending the conflict in GazaOpen discussions about how the mass deportations will work, and open talk of jail time for mayors who help illegals evade deportationMSNBC goes to Mar a Lago to beg Trump to not destroy their networkThat is a short but stunning list of developments in 3 weeks and the dude isn‚Äôt even in office yet.The left has been running a gaslighting operation for decades and it is collapsing like a house of cards.Biden is sliding this pardon in there to try and take advantage of the holiday news cycle.  And it is a not-subtle message of what is to come.  I fully expect these blanket pardons to be issued to at least some of the following: Jack Smith‚Äôs lawfare cabal, the New York and Atlanta prosecutors, Andrew Weissman, Mary McCord, and others.A lot of Trump 47 is going to be simply ‚Äúrelease it all‚Äù ‚Äì full declassification, no redactions ‚Äì knowing that prosecutions will be an uphill battle.  Full sunlight.

            Mexico is NOT caving on the border. After the phone call, Sheinbaum re-iterated that there would be no real changes. None against Fentanyl, none against illegal immigration, none on the cartels or Chinese washing of products via imports. None.She told Trump some BS and then backtracked on it. Pubicly. As if she expected no real consequences for telling Trump one thing and then very soon after publicly contradicting Trump about the phone agreement.Obama likely reached out to her and told her that Trump will not be taking office.As a practical matter, Obama has expensive habits. New multi-millionaire homes ever other year, luxury vacations, expensive clothes, cars, and entourages. Even Nicholas Cage could not at the height of his earnings power could not keep up that spending.So where is Obama‚Äôs money coming from? There is a reason Biden was selected by Obama as President. The fifty percent for the big guy is mostly for the even bigger guy. The Ukraine Grift has to go on so Obama and his entire machine can continue to grift.I don‚Äôt know if Obama can make it stick, but I certainly see him trying to remove Trump from the Presidency and assuming it himself. There are all sorts of rumors going around.

                Trump forced them to put 27,000 troops on the border last time, and he did it with a weak hand and multiple phony impeachments.I was in Canada last week and they were freaking out about the tariffs.  They let a lot of people come over from Canada, and they‚Äôre a draw for illegals using the US as a pass through.  That twit in Mexico immediately walked back her tough talk.Mexico will comply or they will wind up with millions and millions of people stuck on their side of the border.  Plus the deportees.Hopefully we use the monetary savings from Ukraine to kill every drug cartel kingpin and smuggler in Mexico.

                I‚Äôd like to think that our new sweetheart in Mexico City is simply out of her depth, but I fear you are correct there is a chance we may see some sort of coup or other machination to keep Trump out of office.
It would explain the relative quiet that has settled over the land in the aftermath of the election.

                This isn‚Äôt 2016, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to depose Trump without risking some kind of conflagration. Anybody besides Vance who sought to replace him would have a serious legitimacy problem, putting it mildly, and Vance would have at least a mild legitimacy problem. So either they would need Vance to be in on it, which is plausible, or else they are willing to risk absolutely everything, because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôd be risking if they tried to depose him and replace him with anyone else.

                So far, Trump seems to be committed to keeping his word.  He‚Äôs not talking wrist-slap tariffs, for example.
And while cease fires come and go, there‚Äôs no mistaking the fact that Trump won followed by efforts to try and stop the fighting all over the place.  No such efforts were taking place a month ago.
The big prize and the toughest is whether he can destroy the deep state through a mix of sunlight, mass firings, and prosecutions.
Im not thrilled with all his cabinet picks, but it‚Äôs clear he has every intention of keeping his word.

I have no idea if Trump is counting on that ‚Äî putting morons like Gorka and Walz as point men, only to settle for a much different deal when he and Putin meet. I hope so. If you go back and look at what he actually did, that was true of Israel/Hamas‚Ä¶

                They don‚Äôt have a choice.  First, they explicitly ran on destroying the deep state.  That was not a half hearted Bullet Point #11 in his speeches.  It was #2 or #3 being the MAGA economy.  Second, to get anything done, he has to overcome the same deep state #resistance.What‚Äôs the best way to weaken his enemies?  Make their secrets public.Biden issuing that pardon helps a lot of people understand who the villains are in this little story.

        It seems that the outrage expressed by the MSM is not about the pardon itself but the fact that it creates a precedent for Trump to pardon his BFFs without limits. I hope Trump‚Äôs first act is to pardon the Jan. 6th victims. There will be the added pleasure to watch the MSM meltdown (‚ÄúTrump encourages more insurrections!‚Äù).

        We‚Äôre on the precipice of the bill coming due for all the malfeasance of the prior half century, and Trump is the fall guy. Yes, he will bluster about draining the Swamp, and likely stir up a lot of impotent recrimination, but 2025 is the year that the plates stop spinning. A lot of soon-to-be unemployed and highly indebted people will be looking for a pound of flesh and narrative angst will not suffice as remedy. Best to get out the big city now. Trump is not coming to rescue you.

                Certainly not.  In that respect, I submit Richard Nixon.  He resigned rather than be the second President impeached.  He might have fought it in the Senate, but then risked the likely prospect of being the first President ‚Äúremoved‚Äù from office.  In any event such was the aspect of impeachment being viewed as so dishonorable a process.Clinton was yet another step down the path when his impeachment failed.  He fought his impeachment and subsequent trial and won basically on a majority party line.  The shame of such having little affect upon the man or his party‚Äîwho voted 100% in favor of Clinton.  Only Rep‚Äôs crossed party lines to acquit.Then there was Pelosi and Trump and the entire process turned into a political side show.  So what‚Äôs next?  Methinks a military coup might well be taken as the next step towards a banana republic.

                    It was the GOP itself that cheapened impeachment by pressing it for lying about a blowjob. However much Clinton might have had it coming for other things with which he wasn‚Äôt charged. It was sort of like getting Capone for tax evasion, yet far less criminal than that. Hardly a high crime or misdemeanor. So I don‚Äôt blame anyone for voting along political lines for what was a 100% political impeachment.

                            Lying under oath about a blowjob. He was not charged with suborning perjury. It was indeed dastardly and indefensible that he lied to so many people who stood up for him on that basis, and there‚Äôs no doubt that he would have fired any of his underlings for conduct identical to his, but he was not charged with these things, and there isn‚Äôt really a legal statute for them I don‚Äôt believe. It being impeachment, and thus not dependent on a legal statute, I think it would have been right to impeach him merely for that double standard, but that‚Äôs not what they did, they impeached him for lying about a blowjob.

                                Only one of the charges was blowjob-related. And even that, not really. It was about a power imbalance between an employer and a subordinate, something Democrats used to (and still do) think is important. Like Groucho Marx said, ‚ÄúThose are my principles and if you don‚Äôt like them, well, I have others.‚Äù
Everything else is clearly impeachable under pretty much any standard. Heck, they would be indictable for anyone else.

                                    Clinton‚Äôs blowjob was perhaps not relevant to the investigation, nonetheless an impeachable offense because of lying about it.  As stated, he could have refused to answer, or even answered truthfully, since everyone knew what the sex acts were that he committed in the Oval Office.  Clinton was a man of low moral character and an inveterate liar.

The lying was mostly the Paula Jones case. He lied, and Arkansas troopers (eventually) came forward with the truth that Paula was not lying.

                                Nonsense, that‚Äôs exactly what he was impeached for‚Äîlying under sworn oath to an investigative committee..  Clinton could have simply said, ‚Äúmy sex life is not under scrutiny here‚Äù and refused to answer, but he did not.  Why? because he was always a lying weasel and always got away with it.
How morally bankrupt can you be, Jeff, to equate the severity of the act with the amelioration of the committed crime of perjury!  Clinton could simply have refused to answer and given reason for such, then one could support such in good conscience.

        The funny thing about the pardon is like, ‚Äúyea, no kidding he would pardon his son.‚Äù Like here in normal world, pardoning your kid is a no-brainer. You‚Äôll expend any amount of political capital to do it, because he‚Äôs your kid. That said, the Biden administration is totally partisan, has fully weaponized the bureaucracy to accomplish their political ends, and is totally incompetent. We‚Äôve all known this for years, so it makes that Hunter would get pardoned, and in a way that makes it blatantly obvious just how craven this administration is. Yet again, though, we learn about the disconnect between official DC and reality. Official DC really does think this administration is sober-minded and full of serious people. I really do think that official DC thought Biden wouldn‚Äôt pardon his own flesh and blood because of the seriousness with which he treated our sacred democracy and institutions.

            I am fairly certain there is mutual hate between the two of them at this point and he would never do anything to benefit Kamala again.  There are probably instructions to keep him on a ventilator through Jan 21st in the event he has a medical emergency just to make sure she is never President.

                I read an op-ed in the National Review today and the guy was saying that Trump should still submit his nominees and staff to background checks from the FBI, in spite of the fact that the FBI is clearly totally politicized, used this background check system to sabotage his incoming administration in 2015, and has not been reformed in any way since (if anything, the bad actors were and continue to be rewarded). The author claimed that, of course, Trump would just be hurting himself by not submitting these picks to this broken institution.The comments were killing the article, which tells me that even conservacucks are quickly getting tired of this act.

                    That‚Äôs typically and historically been the practice ‚Äì leave it to this administration to break yet another norm ‚Äì but that is surely for political reasons. It‚Äôs obviously bad practice and sets a horrible precedent to just pardon whomever you want for anything they might have done. Yet, the Constitution makes it clear that this power is extremely broad, and the courts would almost certainly, rightly in my view, defer to the POTUS on this.

            As mentioned, there are no limits to the power in the Constitution.  Also, the aspect of a ‚Äúpre-conviction‚Äù pardons would seem to have been decided when Ford pardoned Nixon.  That‚Äôs perhaps the biggest objection I have to this unlimited pardon power. A trial and conviction is in essence a clearing of the air for the public understanding.  Pardoning Hunter for a crime or crimes he may have committed prevents the truth from being known to the public.  Without truth, how can there be justice?

                    Certainly, but Nixon denied involvement‚Äîeven when firing those caught who worked directly for him, Nixon was not convicted of anything.  There was no admission of guilt or contriteness.  Even today at the State level, you have little chance of even obtaining parole without an admission of guilt and repentance.
Yeah, the above is old fashion in today‚Äôs modern ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, Nonetheless serves (IMHO) an important part of the justice system.

        ‚ÄúThe Hunter Biden pardon is the start of a great sweep up from a party that went on far too long.‚ÄùMy immediate (cynical) thought was wrt the concept of ‚Äúsweep up‚Äù.  Last I heard the term used, the physical process from which the allegory stems was related to a local city area that was trashed extensively and was a public eyesore.  The sweep up was accompanied by the installation of public trash cans, dedication of frequent maintenance and emptying, with increased police enforcement of littering law. In short, a process of restoration was accompanied by a process of ‚Äúprevention‚Äù.So my thought is, what will we now be doing differently to prevent a recurrence of another Biden crime family looting the government at the highest level?  Without punishment, I see nothing of significance being done.  Indeed, perhaps the opposite‚Äîone needs to set one‚Äôs sights even bigger when looting the empire.  So big, that it is ‚Äúswept under‚Äù the table so to speak, rather than exposed in public.Perhaps ‚Äúswept under‚Äù was what Z-man meant all along‚Ä¶.

                The FBI (?) issued a report after interviewing Biden which basically said he was a forgetful old man (euphemism for senile).  What court will deal with such an individual‚Äîespecially when he now hires a lawyer and doctor to appear in court for him to testify as to such impairment.Heck, even in my State I am no longer able to be called for jury duty due to age.  The Fed‚Äôs just sent me a summons for Fed duty.  The summons provides an automatic deferral (if I request) simply based upon my (advanced) age.  No thought seems to be given as to mental acuity and age is used for a proxy.  Funny how that is ignored for Fed and State judges, but old academics not so much.

            Well with this pardon (really more like blanket immunity) the only leverage anyone has over him anymore is extrajudicial.  Fear and greed are helpful but remember that old pirate saying about dead men and take telling.

                Maybe. So far as I know,this is uncharted territory. ‚ÄúPardons for Offenses against the United States‚Äù may not apply to un-named offenses. So far as I know, only in the case of Nixon has it been applied that way, and even then, it was only because Nixon resigned his office and was said to have ‚Äúalready paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office in the United States.‚Äù

                    In the Nixon case, there was no judicial‚Äîas in SCOTUS‚Äîdetermination of the Constitutionality of the pardon granted by Ford.  Not sure there will be one now.  The Court is hesitant to get involved in political squabbles.

        ‚ÄúSay what you will about Joe Biden, but he loves his kids, perhaps too much. At some level, you must respect his family loyalty. There is an old world gangsterism about his willingness to help his family loot the political system.‚Äù
For lack of a better way of describing it, Catholic culture, maybe? Roman culture? European culture? I‚Äôd never rat on a family member and I‚Äôd probably do the same thing in his place. That extends to my kid, brothers, cousins, nephews, nieces, wife, in-laws, etc.

            Definitely not Roman. Probably not European, as while one may well try to defend family, as patriarch, he would have made sure no one in his family had done anything to besmirch the name. Could be pre-Reformation Catholicism, where you could always buy yourself out of sin.
The question is not whether you would bail out family, but whether you would overlook it, or even participate in the first place.

                I‚Äôm thinking about this from the standpoint of the mob as an analogy. You‚Äôre loyal to the family, which was an extension of real life. People in southern Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere really are loyal to their blood.

                    Maybe southern Europe. Northern Europeans regularly disowned family who brought dishonor to the name.

Not necessarily. Even an emperor might be made to publicly do penance barefoot in the snow.

            I see this as more of a thing that people do where the state is weak, or clearly adversarial (as in the case of British India, colonial Africa, etc..). In feudal times, for example, ‚Äúthe State‚Äù was some local county-sized area controlled by a duke or prince. Of course you were more loyal to your kin than ‚Äúthe State‚Äù, unless of course you were part of the duke‚Äôs family in which case family = State. The various tribes the US is now being flooded with are all people from areas that typically placed more value on family than State or ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù. As an example, Indians are particularly notorious for ignoring American notions about hiring discrimination. I expect this kind of thing to become more common simply because more and more recent fake-mericans are from places like this.

        Washington loves to play its political games. Within the Beltway, there is a sense that everything is unreal and we‚Äôre living in a dream and only power makes things concrete. Power is the great leveler. Power clarifies, is the one constant. The lawyers who fill the political ranks are trained in deception, including self-deception. On the one hand they are cynical about the whole process, on the other they genuinely believe they are helping things out. Like rats following the Pied Piper, they follow after whoever seems strongest in the moment. To be a Washington insider means speaking in a coded shorthand language all its own. They‚Äôre playing with lives.‚Äî Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
