        Its 2018 and the unemployment rate is up, businesses have hopped across the municipal boundary and you cant find a coffee except at StarbucksPremium (that will be $10.50 for your non fat soy latte with a vanilla shot).  Cue the puzzled editorials about how, why did Seattle lose its vitality?  How do we get mr and mrs jones and their one point five kids to shop downtown ?  The handwringing should be entertaining.

        I know not Ms Sawant, so I cannot really comment on her actions or motivation. But having left India for the States she now has risen to a position of some prominence. Perhaps it is a higher position than she might have held in her country of origin. Who knows what happens in the that vast sub-continet?But what we do know is that having arrived in the US she set about promoting socialist ideas, and I may imagine in so doing she stopped a locally-born US-citizen socialist from taking power — though perhaps Seattle had no socialists-in-waiting to call their own and thus the woman stepped bravely into the breach.There is also the point about ‘rising income inequality.’ It is a reasonable assumption that the people at the top will not really want the lower orders from matching their wage, though they may give the principle of better paid minions some seeming support. My guess is that the wealthy will quietly move their wages up proportionally. Inequality, despite loud shouts from the rank and file, exists because those at the top make sure they go on being well paid.It doesn’t need me to say that what currently costs one dollar will shortly cost three or more dollars, but then I’m not a socialist so I am not surprised. However higher wages and correspondingly higher prices paid for goods and services always surprises socialists, local or international.

        At the minimum we will see what happens and hopefully the econonists can finally come to some agreement re: the “right” minimum wage. Forbes had a decent article bashing Sea-Tec’s $15 minimum wage. Apparently employers cut non cash compensation and the two employees interviewed weren’t happy about it. The bottom line – pointed out by Zero Hedge – is that when you look at the monthly job numbers, the vast majority of new jobs are low wage. If low wage jobs vastly outnumber medium and high wage jobs, how will the majority of workers survive? So let’s see what happens with a $15 minimum wage – worse things have been thought of.
