        I’ve had a couple ‘conservative’ people say to me how happy they are about that PC wedding in England and how the little black babies in the royal family will be so cute. It completely bizarre to me that these white people are gleefully advocating for the destruction of the white race and for the harm to their own white children. I don’t understand. I don’t have any children so I don’t have any skin in the game but these people do.  I can’t really chalk it up to anything except really effective brainwashing

            Yes, you do have skin in the game.  You have other Caucasian kith and kin, some of whom must have children.
I assume that you do not want to see the destruction of the white race.
Therefore, let your voice be a bulwark against the brainwashing.

                Also, it would help if you found a nice girl to marry and have some children with.  Get some skin in the game, brother!!  Your country is calling you to do your part.  No excuses.

            I recently ran into a retired British couple who were taken aback because I predicted Harry and Meghan would split in a year or so, three at the most. These people are idiots. They really believe all the gush they see on TV. I’m glad my ancestors left that fog beshrouded isle centuries ago.

                Eh, money and power make up for a lot.   Harry does seem like a nice guy, and being married to royalty will give her lots of attention, fun vacays, etc.
I’ll give a decade before she gets bored and cashes out.   I’m romantic like that.

            The British royal family is not exactly a shining light of the white thing, once you get beyond Elizabeth and Philip’s generation.  A lost cause, actually.

                I don’t care about the royal family but white people gushing about non-white people marrying into it is symptomatic of a larger problem.Sometimes I think the self sacrifice of Christ is being manifest the secular descendants of Christendom but, of course, they are not divine

                Lilibet is regal. Philip played his part spot on. How their children turned out to be such losers is a mystery. That said, there were quite a few losers in the House of Windsor.

            What is wrong with Harry? Marrying a low grade mulatto of all things is stupid. Did anyone even talk to the fool about this?He pretty much could have had the pick of the little and instead went for gutter trash,. His kids won’t look like him and will not identify with his side of the family. He doesn’t get Markel went out her way to make herself look white. When the babies come they will have afros and Harry will be going WTF?And yeah I agree with the other poster, the marriage won’t last long either.  Big culture clash.  Blacks are not whites and she is not even a upper class black. She’s just a social climber.

                I was in a buffet at Las Vegas. At a table close to me was a slightly bewildered-looking white guy in his 30’s sitting next to a decent-looking black gal. The rest of the table of six was taken up by her relatives, all of whom were both large and loud. I’m thinking he didn’t bother to meet her family before the wedding. I wonder if the Prince has met his in-laws….

            I understand it.  Many white people truly believe the answer to racial problems is for everyone to inter-marry into one “happy human race.”  I actually used to believe that, (a long, long time ago) so I understand the mindset.  So you take that mindset and help it along with nonstop We-are-the-world/I’d-like-to-teach-the-world-to-sing propaganda, along with making it taboo or Nazi to be pro-white, and here we are.
It’s hard to break through that conditioning, although the left piling on with their evils of whiteness campaign is helping us out.  So we’ve got that going for us….

                The fact that the words that have come pouring out of her mouth, as well as her commitment to racial grievance,sounds like she considers herself to be just as black as a pure bred African when it comes to which side she’s identified with- just like mulatto Barry.

        The turning point for me was talking to a normal looking white girl in college, so she hadnt gone full hair all over body except her head feminist. Somehow, we got to talking about race and the welfare state in a round about way. We kept it cordial. At some point, she looked me in the eye and completely innocently said, “The more I talk about it, the more I realize white people need to die off so we can get socialism.”I was expected to nod along to this realization. All the Hispanics and the one black woman nodded. She didn’t think this was insane at all.We are in this together.

                Who is going to repatriate dark skinned parasites.  There is plenty of USA blood to suck out of us before we expire.  I don’t see any sign of recent immigrants leaving the USA.   Much less the original dark-skinned residents.   The “back to Africa” movement ended with the 1960s.The Rastafarians had it right:  Marcus Garvey is prophet.  All blacks should join his cult and return to Africa, as he preached.Well, that would be nice, but it’s not happening.  I bet a million Jamaicans have arrived here since 1980.  What’s gonna make them go back to their shithole?Certainly nothing Trump is doing.  In fact, in so far as the economy is booming, it’s a great time to be a no-skills immigrant.

            The problem is that they see wealth and prosperity as simply something that is, and has not been earned or worked for.  It is also seen as relatively bottomless, so it can be spread around and divvied up.  There is a part of me that would like to see no inheritance, 100% estate tax.  That would hurt the whites the most, as they are the ones who save and pass wealth on most reliably.  But it would be good revenge for the sorts you are talking about.  And since no one else should get my tax, stack it up on the boat around my dead body, send the boat off from shore, and light the whole thing up.  Yeah, I could go for that.

Also notable:  he was running against G H W Bush, who was probably using his CIA (and yes, it was “his” CIA) to spy on PJB.  GHW Bush was a Platinum-Card Member of the Deep State and most likely one of its top consiglieres.

                Anyone wanting to move from the U.S. to Africa should be given reparations, stripped of U.S. citizenship and sent away. Why tell anyone no? Think of the types who’d like to live there. Bye bye!

            I think the woman is spot-on with the idea of reparations.  The US government grants a tax-free, lump-sum amount to every black family in the US, only on the condition that the recipient immediately renounce US citizenship and leave the US within a a year.  And at least 50% of black citizens have to participate or nobody gets any money.  Hell, as a taxpayer, I’d even be in favor of building settlements all over West Africa for the recipients to move to.In the long run, the white taxpayer would save a lot of money.

        Democrats scratching their heads and wondering why they are losing whites votes is pretty funny.
They constantly tell white people they hate them, can’t stop droning on about White Privilege (maybe the most annoying subject in the world to working-class whites), attack every institution whites value, and are actively importing their replacements.
Gee, I wonder why whitey won’t vote for you?

        I seriously doubt it. In England, the white working class are still voting Labour, who sold them out to their leftist lunacy and mass immigration 40+ years ago.Whitey, at least here, is too tribal to vote another way and too scared to be labelled a racist to vote for their skin.Also, the main parties will lie that they will represent Whitey and once elected, favour the immigrants and minorities after the vote.

                    I saw that too in Boston in the 1970s.  It was sickening.  Louise Day Hicks vs. Ted Kennedy.  She was lower class and he wasn’t (although you could have fooled me with his behavior).  Anyway, Southie got beaten down — helped in good part by thugs like Whitey Bulger sending in boatloads of drugs, ruining a generation of kids there.  Awful Robert Mueller was on the scene, too, and made sure the FBI framed the wrong people and kept them in jail, and had on the lam Whitey as an FBI informant vs. the Italian mafia.  Weird how Uber-WASPy Mueller was mixing it up with this crew.  I am sure there are people/big name attorneys in Boston who absolutely hate his guts.  Alan Dershowitz is one.  Fed. Judge Mark Wolf is probably another.  Harvey Silverglate, too.  I hope they get his ass someday soon.

            Voting is (supposed to be) secret. I wonder if people feel free to vote their conscience, or if their conscience is so pickled that they’re looking over their shoulder, even in the voting booth.
I’d vote differently if people could figure out my vote. In my state, people can look up what party you voted for in particular local and state elections. So, as a Republican, if as a protest, I voted for a Democrat, the entire R apparatus knows about it.

        How ironic will it be if social justice tyranny turns whites into a monolithic voting bloc with 45% of the population.
The antiwhite coalition will eventually break up. The liberal whites and secular jews that hold it together are dying off and no one else will be able to hold it together.
Once that happens the tribal confederation will break up, and one of the factions will see this huge, seething mass of people and start to mobilise them.

But not without a remote. The ads – targeted to us old people who enjoy such programming – are filled with black people, middle-aged white-haired lesbians; ok, sure, the ads show some guy walking away from his tractor or his barn, a white guy with twenty pounds more weight than is good for him.

            I hate those Blue Cross/Blue Shield advertisements, too.  Always happy-clappy light-skinned black couples with “natural” silver hair, skipping along on some nature trail.  This has never happened.  The ads refuse to show giant pubescent gorilla girls like the ones you see at Wal-Mart wearing flourescent leggings and sandals revealing their horrible flat feet, or the dusky skinny “yout” with the falling-down pants, orange socks and soccer sandals, and the latest “flowerpot” haircut, carrying his 10 month old offspring while he picks up something for dinner.  Why don’t the insurance companies feature these very real folks?

        People will continue to vote their interests.  For whites, it’s less about skin color than things like basic law and order…which do happen to coincide with race, but most white people wouldn’t put it that way even if deep down it’s what they think.Hispanics are going to get neutralized because it’s a phony, made up, Government category.  There are black people who are “Hispanic”.  There are white people who are “Hispanic”.  There are the Mexican dirt farmers who are “Hispanic”.  From a political polling point of view, “Hispanic” simply means “people with a Spanish language heritage or surname WHO SUPPORT DEMOCRATS.  You’re not “Hispanic” if you vote Republican.  See also, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, George Zimmerman, etc.  Those are just white people.  I would wager that the polls do not pick up on the number of people who the Government would consider Hispanic vs. the number who DECLARE that they are Hispanic…which is a much smaller number.  I would wager that 90% or more of people who say “I’m Hispanic” also vote Democrat.  Those that don’t vote some other way.The worry the Democrats have isn’t simply whites increasingly voting as a bloc.  The worry Democrats have is that Trump – because of his media stature over the last 40 years – starts to peel off core Democrat constituencies like blacks and “Hispanics”.  Hence the really bizarre over-the-top reaction they had towards that rapper/pop singer a couple of weeks ago.  They know they are losing whites…but what terrifies them is that an improving economy led by a President that everybody and their mother knows IS NOT A RACIST will cause them to lose votes among their base.Like I’ve said a few times and gotten beaten up about it in the last year, the things that white people generally believe are not limited to white people.  Not even all white people believe those things (like Jews who vote for the party of Hamas).  The future, I think, belongs to the person/party that breaks up the current order, mixes things up, and then everything breaks down into two groups:Those who think the United States of America is a real place whose citizens are unique and possess real rights and real self government.vs.Those who think the area known as the USA is simply another borderless trade zone to be managed out of Brussels to be carved up and sold off to the highest bidder.

            This, all of it … except for failing to mention that the reality is that whites are the only racial group where the clear majority falls into category #1.
You’re right that the Pubs don’t need to identify as the “white party,” and that they can pull off meaningful fractions from other groups … but it’ll never be more than a fraction.

                I agree, but if you really want to just torture the Progs, start stripping away their core voters.  That would just tear them up and drive them crazy.  Plenty of “Hispanics”, Asians, and Blacks willing to vote to put their country ahead of the plutocrats.

            You make one mistake. Whites have no real political representation. Prior to Trump the GOP was ready to pass amnesty and TPP and roll out the red carpet for Hilary. Basically slit our collective throats.Trump is the only thing holding the GOP from reverting back to the open border, free trading mega-cucks they were before. When he’s gone. They will revert and collapse as a party.Look the GOP has always been hostile to white blue collars and the middle-class.  This is why the Democrats had a lock on their votes up until NAFTA.Look at the way the GOP elite treated Reagan. When he got the nomination they ran  John Anderson to derail his shot at the White House.  With Goldwater they had Romney Sr. to f**k him over. They hate populists.  They hate pols who represent the people. Look how they have treated Trump – like shit.Their ideal voter is a upper middle-class professional or employed in the FIRE industry who pulls down mid six figures or more.

        Another part of this that was foreseen by the right but not the left is that as nonwhites increasingly dominate the Democratic Party, even whites who are liberal are going to start feeling excluded.  Just this morning there was a thing in the paper about “students of color” at Georgetown holding an event and ordering their “white allies” not to attend.  That kind of thing is happening more and more, and it’s not hard to see how even the most perfectly progressive soyboys are going to start understanding that no matter what they say or do they will always be the bad guy.There’s only so much self-loathing a normal human being can take, and only so many masochisic white people willing to vote Democratic. Moreover, and this is the real power of Sailer’s idea of labeling Democrats as the “black party,” even Hispanics and Asians are going to come to understand that on the left they are second-class victims, and thus second-class citizens.This is why Republicans do not need to overtly identify/label themselves as “the white party,” the Democrats are doing it for them.

            It will get to the point soon that the Democrats won’t be able to run a white male for president.  It’s going to have to be a minority or a woman.  And then eventually when it’s all minorities, they’ll squabble among themselves.  Asian vs. Black vs. HIspanic vs. Muslim.   The Democrats have rapid demographic change in their favor, but at the same time, anti-whiteness and tribal chaos is working against them.

                First, the Republicans will be pushed out of power and then the white Democrats.  For example, the last Republican mayor of Newark, NJ, left office on 1/1/53, the last white Democrat on 7/1/70, and since then all of the mayors of Newark were black and a light-skinned Puerto Rican.
In diverse Democratic areas, they’ll split according to race, ethnicity and religion.

        Europe is still the bellwether indicator of how this will all play out. My guess is that some of those nations will regroup in time to save themselves and others will succumb to eventual disintegration and chaos. We should be able to observe and learn from their leading edge experience. A rebound from disaster can only occur if the society still possesses a core of able-bodied males with which to fight back.

            Agree. The object of the EU was to obliterate nations and their separate cultures. But a dozen cultures speaking different languages remain as a laboratory for rebellion from the plans of their masters. It is a form of federalism that we have lost. Once a single avenue of escape is demonstrated the dam will burst. If there is a first one. That’s the game.

        The GOP should outreach to Asians by individual ethnic group.  “Asians” is a particularly ridiculous grouping of people in the USA, it’s designed to make high IQ 3rd generation Japanese Americans, who are all professionals feel that they have something in common with Samoans who are FOB.Each of the main groups should be wooed independently.  There is a lot of anti-Chinese feeling among many other Asians, a strategy that points out that China is trying to take over Taiwan,  invading Philippine waters, threatening South Korea with their proxy the Norks, and dis-respecting Thailand – and the Dems are a tool of the Chinese might be a useful strategy.By all means the GOP needs to prevent Asians from coalescing into a large synthetic grievance groups like “Hispanics”.

            Yes, the high-IQ East Asians are in a similar situation to whites in that affirmative action for blacks/Latinos hurts them. That’s at least one angle. Also I suspect the old “law and order” dog whistles might work in that most Asian groups have very low crime rates and are generally quiet and self-effacing in public. Make sure the Democrats are represented by the loudest most obnoxious black activist types (the Dems do a good job of this anyway).

            I find exhortations for more GOP racial outreach tiresome. Republicans have been saying this at least since Reagan and failed.  Is there really some undiscovered magic pitch for getting non-whites to vote GOP?  Perhaps non-whites are generally ethnocentric and the GOP isn’t a vehicle for that.
The Asians are one of the best examples of this.  They are smart people who have every reason to vote GOP but they vote like Hispanics.  They don’t mind the higher taxes and crime that come with voting Democrat if it furthers the dismantling of the dominant white group’s political power.

        I think the diversity über alles crowd made a mistake when they turned the corner from attempting to redress historical wrongs against the descendants of slaves to actively promoting the displacement of white people in favor of any non-white person, even recent arrivals and those in the country illegally.    That caused people to “notice.”

What historical WRONGS and why were they WRONG? Was White America, which had been stabbed in the back with the 14th Amendment, WRONG because they wanted to prevent blacks from being part of the body politic? How did including them BENEFIT Whites? And is that any different than what any other culture that has promoted their own ethnicity has done throughout the History of Mankind? Please discuss.

                Okay.  I believe that the capturing, transporting, and extracting the labor of people without their consent or remunerating them (i.e., Slavery) is a moral wrong.   What happened in the 19th century–the 14th and the offer of return to Africa–is a done deal.  The “should have picked your own d*mn cotton” argument is irrelevant.   Nobody gets to know what might have been.  Many waves of immigration have not benefited the descendants of the founders or their wish to bequeath this country to “our posterity.”There was and is no immigrant metropolitan area that’s embraced the constitution.   So what’s your big idea?

                    You completely avoided the question. This is what you said:“I think the diversity über alles crowd made a mistake when they turned the corner from attempting to redress historical wrongs against the descendants of slaves”What you referred to was WRONGS against the DESCENDANTS of slaves. And yet, the only WRONG you can point to in response to my question was a WRONG done to the original Africans that were brought over here. A WRONG, I might add, that only a minority of individuals in the entire world considered a moral wrong when it happened. Try again, this time, tell us about the wrongs done to the descendants of slaves.

        I would like to see a in depth analysis of South carolina voring patterns.  30% AA but consistently red.  I’m not sure if the blacks fail to vote as a block or the whites vote their skin.   When i examine south africa and see that many whites are still voting liberal, i lose hope.  But if things flip along the lines of SC then maybe….   Not sure if there is enuf good whites to sink this ship.

        “Whites have slowly but consistently moved away from the Democratic Party. These recent losses are on top of Democrats’ losses among Southern whites during the 1960s and 1970s after Democrats’ support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.”One problem; that is factually incorrect. Republicans voted in higher percentages for these bills than the Dems.debate.When the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the “Southern Bloc” of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator led by Richard Russell (D-GA) launched a filibuster to prevent its passage.[16] Said Russell: “We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our (Southern) states.”[17]Strong opposition to the bill also came from Senator Strom Thurmond (D-SC): “This so-called Civil Rights Proposals, which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend beyond the realm of reason. This is the worst civil-rights package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the Reconstruction proposals and actions of the radical Republican Congress.”

        [blockquote]these voters are waking up to the reality of the demographic age as well. It’s playing out in their neighborhoods now and they are responding accordingly.[\blockquote]Yup. I’ve been red-pilled for a while, but I recently decamped my big blue city for the suburbs. I grew up in the suburbs of said city, so I am familiar with the general character, reputation, etc. of most suburbs of this city. But I was astounded by just how non-white UPSCALE suburbs have become.For fun I decided to look at the demographics of 5 of the most elite high schools in the area. These are schools that 20 or 30 years ago would’ve been 95%+ white. I purposely chose a geographically diverse sample of elite high schools to avoid a clustering effect. The percentage of white students ranged from 60% – 84% at these 5 elite schools. And remember, that is high school—elementary schools have even lower percentages.Sure, most of the “diversity” at these schools is Asian, but still, these numbers are astounding.  Typical family income for students at these schools would be $200k – $1M a year. These are not white proles trapped in slums. Of course, the demographics of these towns as a whole are much whiter due to the legacy Boomers still living there.I think a good way to convert people is to simply show them the numbers. I came into this research pessimistic, but the real numbers exceeded my red-pillled expectations.

        Z. Noticed that you linked the “One Man Crime Wave” article in the Sun. Good golly…Don’t know if this editorial by the Sun’s resident moonbat Boomer (Dan Rodericks) crossed your path. Unintentional humor of the blackest sort.Enjoy:http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/dan-rodricks-blog/bs-md-rodricks-0523-story.html

        Respectfully, Z, that’s not really math.  It’s just arithmetic.  Progressives have been caught living in the future while forgetting about the present.
Imagine that.  Even us normies can see that clearly.  Interesting times ahead.
