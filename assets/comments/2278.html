        I dug up the details.  He was 18.  The child was 12.  My question is: where the hell were the parents?  An article says the 12 year old was playing video games with his “older” friends.  Who allows their 12 year old to be “friends” with mid-teen and older boys?  And who allows those older teens to be alone with their child?
While it is beneficial for pre-pubescent kids to socialize with other age groups, even the post-pubescent, it should be supervised by parents.

        What if the dad is lying?  The face pictured above looks like a kid himself, maybe 16 max.  Maybe when he heals he’ll look older?  How old is the dad’s son?  Maybe they were just a couple of gay teens engaging in consensual activity.  I’ll google around and see what details I can dig up.

        One of the worst mistakes I have ever made was when I was on a Federal Grand Jury in Houston. A child pornography case. The ADA told us we were free to examine the photographic evidence they seized, but advised against it.
I was compelled by a sense of duty to look at some of them. I wish I had not seen them. Those people are sick, sick, sick. Irredeemable. Execution would be a favor to them and the rest of the world.

        Florida – prosecutor/jury could go either way.
But it doesn’t matter. If he isn’t dead, the whupee will do it again, no matter what punishment he gets. Child molesters never quit molesting children. Ever.

            Yep. We would be wise to create a penal colony for them and send them off for the remainder of their lives. That or put them in general population and let the cons handle ’em.
