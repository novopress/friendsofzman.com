        I have now developed a skill which allows me to ignore much of the advertising thrown at me.  I can click off pop-up ads without ever knowing the product.  I can read blogs and articles and never scan the sidelines for ads.  I have many presets on my car radio and always change the station when being hit up with ads.  I stopped listening to Hannity on the radio because there are more ads than content. When ads are particularly obnoxious, I make a mental note to not buy their products.  Side note; years ago Toyota had the most obnoxious “Toyotathon” ads and I vowed to never buy a Toyota product and I never have.  Notice to advertisers: If you seek to get my attention by being obnoxious, I will first avert my eyes and ears from your ad and will actively seek other sources for your product.  I also avoid products that advertise by portraying white males as lazy, ignorant, or beta.  But I stand alone, I think.

        I have nothing against soccer (football). I detest American soccer fans. They are what you guys would call “wankers” or worse.
American sports teams are getting ready to festoon their uniforms with ads too. Our World Series will probably one day feature the Azerbaijan Red Sox versus the New Mexico City Dodgers. New Mexico City will be what “we” renamed Los Angeles.

        You may not like what you call soccer, but football as British fans know it has been slowly squeezed the same way. The sport remains, despite the attendance of celebrities and politicians wanting to be seen to be part of the common herd, a working class interest. But even in areas of low employment and social limitation the marketing machine grinds on without check. The team I follow is ‘sponsored’ by another country: the shirts are emblazoned with ‘Azerbaijan: Land of Fire’ but you can bet very few of the team’s fans would even remotely think of going there rather than a cheap, boozy Spanish resort if they can afford a vacation at all. Sure it gets Azerbaijan’s name on TV but while that is the purpose my team’s traditional uniform is reduced to an advertising billboard. Of course, admission prices to see these ads go up accordingly.Fans wearing the team’s shirts also freely advertise this distant country, and pay generously for the privilege too.If there is one thing that soccer has in its favour it is that there are no advertising breaks in the 45 minute halves, which for those who like the game makes watching it on TV bearable. But part of me thinks it is only a matter of time before some bright spark institutes paid for breaks in those stretches to tell us where to go next for vacations. Chechnya, anyone?

        Yeah. You probably don’t cooperate with waves either.
The Fenway bleachers were a buck in ’67. Conigliaro’s swearing in Italian was free. The organ between innings and the PA announcing at bats, that was about it. That was also the last year you could walk up at game time and get a ticket in any section. Or talk to the players.
Gil Hodges told a story of how the players knew the regular fans by name back in the day in Brooklyn. Pros and cons, I guess. The last time I visited Fenway I paid 40 for standing room.

            They used to let you in free after the seventh inning. That’s gone too.
I can live with higher ticket prices. The facilities are better and the amenities are much better. The ticket prices reflect what the public is willing to pay for those better things. The other stuff is what’s killing them.
