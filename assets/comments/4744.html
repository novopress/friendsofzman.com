        I was laughing too until the many revelations over the past day or so about her past behavior. I’m now inclined to think she’s living totally in a fantasy world, probably has severe mental problems, and probably needs medical help – a whole lot of medical help. I hope she calms down and seeks it.

            Well, they say that intelligence is inversely proportional to the greed present…Since NAACP’s greed in near infinite, their intelligence is near the absolute zero…Proof, their leader was a pinko honkie with blue eyes…Cant blame her for squeezing that bunch of morons for all they had…When you are that stupid, you dont deserve to have money…

        I’m laughing every time I see a picture of this “black” woman. Her own parents are mystified. They said, “She has issues.” Understatement of the year.

        Egalitarianism means no differences between the sexes either.  That’s the real reasoning behind all of the gender bending and related cheer leading going on.
[Psst. I think the sola scriptura (Paulist) crowd just crashed the party.]

            One of the stranger things in the last election was seeing Bible-believers call the Mormons a cult outside of Christian tradition. Catholics and most Protestants consider the Bible-only types to be wildly misinformed, at the very minimum.

                When I was a kid, the bible reading was not recommended for catholics unless you had a classical education…(It was supposed to make sense of all this charabia written by goat herders)…all this being fairly irrelevant today when you see seven years old sons of muslimines hacking at the neck of bound prisoners with machetes…Jesus did say:”whoever is without sin cast the first stone” While Muhammad said:”Don’t cast too big stones so you make the fun last longer”…Aaaand this will soon be the “new” new religion, “Kill thy neighbor before he kill you, rape your wife to death and sell your children to arab whorehouses”.

        It is my understanding that for a Christian to get into heaven they must accept that Jesus is their savoir. Following the rules comes after that and is of lessor importance.

                In your opinion I am profoundly stupid. Glad that’s cleared up. I will stupidly keep reading your blog regardless of our difference in opinion, because one doesn’t have to like you in order to consider your perspective. However, if you are ever fool enough to breathe the same air as I, your insult will still be fresh upon me. Cheers.

                        Very well. Internet snark from the 90’s be damned. I do not like my faith being painted with the same broad brush you paint all Christ-affiliated religious fervor. Christianity as I have grown to understand it is based upon the grace of forgiveness for the sins of an imperfect animal (me), free for the asking, requiring no strict adherence to rules. That last part should be fairly obvious, unless you believe there are perfect humans. The concept was not invented by a pope, only the name. It began with a man named Jesus, and the venom you spew would be better directed at fallen men rather than the greatest gift ever given.

                            I used traditional definitions for Christianity. I would not, for example, consider Mormons to be inside the Christian tradition. By the sounds of it, your “Christ-affiliated” thing is outside the Christian tradition as well. Before you get yourself worked up into a lather over “the venom I spew” keep in mind that I wish you nothing but the best with whatever it is you have going on there.
