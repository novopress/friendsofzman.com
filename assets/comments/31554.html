        Speeding tickets = Nazis or KGB.Really?But who doesn‚Äôt want to üí© on cops who write tickets?   Ez peezee.The Nuremberg Defense- is sorry, valid.  No order, laws, or military, state, municipalities can function without following orders.    The Nuremberg trials were a farce.   Posturing by those who didn‚Äôt fight, those who did were against the tribunals, example being Patton in his diary.    When it came time for soldiers to judge say over the Malmy massacre, the Canadian officer in charge said ‚Äúwait a minute, I don‚Äôt know a Colonel in this war who hasn‚Äôt said ‚Äòthis time I don‚Äôt want prisoners.‚Äô The German Commander walked.Every nation at Nuremberg was guilty of the same sins to a greater or lesser degree.The German crime was defeat.  Vae Victas.Like being white in say Baltimore.  Ahem.As for the police we‚Äôve got, wait until you meet their replacements.As for the moral courage to disobey- like physical courage you‚Äôll get your chance shortly, not to mention prove how violence is morally and telegenically done.Live not by Lies !!! LMAO.

        The majority of law enforcement initially want to serve their community and do good. A few years of dealing with garbage attitudes, everyone hating you, seeing horrible things (pulling dead children out of vehicles or homes) and dealing with incompetent supervisors who got to their position through nepotism, and they just go to work to finish their shift. The younger officers write the BS speed trap tickets to please their supervisor, who is usually incompetent and wants the maximum amount of statistics to look good. The older officers just answer their calls because they know everything is lose/lose.

        On the other hand, you know the hand with poo on it ( California) it‚Äôs no longer acceptable for Mr police officer to pull someone over with expired plates if it‚Äôs within in 2 months of expiration. I saw at least 3 today with 2022 and one with no plates at all. Oh I forgot, you can ride a dirt bike on the street without a helmet as well. The helmet thing is a step in the right direction, I don‚Äôt like having to wear a helmet.

        Well, to be perfectly honest, the pulled over driver was probably a negro, who more likely than not, had no insurance.  So increasing premiums ‚Äì no problem.  Thus, it was a good collar (not that it‚Äôs going to make any difference) after the fact.  It‚Äôs further totally hilarious that the former life imprisonment/death penalty ‚ÄúI was just following orders‚Äù statement is now just business as usual‚Ä¶

        ‚Äú Once people stopped following orders, the whole thing collapsed. It is something to think about the next time you are pulled over for speeding on a lonely highway.‚ÄòInteresting thought.  I‚Äôm old enough to remember when most States had no ‚ÄúSpeed Limits‚Äù, or rather, the signs were in the form of ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù.  A defense in those days was something along the line of ‚Äú ‚Ä¶clear and present conditions‚Ä¶‚Äù. In short, an open stretch of highway in good weather was fair game to open her up.  Think Autobaun.As the State became more ‚Äúmanagerial‚Äù as you describe, the laws were changed and this defense was finally written specifically out by law and now, to even go 1 mile above the speed limit posted was good for conviction.  The rule of 10 miles over is really not a rule/law, but a local cop policy to avoid most hassles and court subpoenas.I think I got the prize one day when I got a citation for 3 miles over.  Later I was informed by LEO‚Äôs I know that this was due to being caught in a ‚Äúrat patrol‚Äù (IIRC).  Seems they pick some stretch of highway and give everyone tickets for an hour or two, then move on to normal duties.

        Bravo, Z-man! This reminds me of the moral jihad against all Russians who ‚Äúfailed to condemn‚Äù the Special Military Operation in Ukraine. These hypocritical Americans are asking Russians to stick their necks out in the way that they themselves would never do. Even if they‚Äôre not arrested (if I understand correctly, penalties are mainly applied to people who ‚Äúdefame the military‚Äù rather than simply opposing the SMO in principle) dissidents in Russia will incur the disapproval of friends, neighbors and especially their bosses. Which is exactly what happens to those of us on the dissident right here in America.

        ‚ÄúThe people in charge, the people we call the left, love the idea of people following orders. They really love seeing the cops unquestioningly following orders.‚Äù This is why they have the most acerbic hatred for The Oath Keepers. Whatever you think of the presentation and people in it, the notion behind it is true nobility, and true dissidence. I will not enforce your laws that violate the highest laws.Of course, that stance can work the other way. In any case, people, especially regime enforcers, who will not enforce the law just because it is the law, if it violates the fundamental law is the end of the regime if that idea spreads.Of course that is why whites must go from police and military forces. They want patronage. Of course, when you start buying your armed enforcers that way, you are headed for a terrible end, and one where everyone goes down with you.Dick Durbin‚Äôs new Americans in the police department are the beginning of the end.

            Regarding the Oathkeepers, I had a few run ins with them at some protests during the peak of the alt-right movement. I don‚Äôt know about what happened elsewhere but for some reason they had a habit of opposing White nationalists and other far-right groups like League of the South more than they did antifa. So while they may have claimed to not be willing to enforce ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù orders, they had no problem with trying to enforce the official morality of the cloud people. Eventually, I and my group came to regard them as worse than antifa. At least antifa was on the other side of the barricades.

        We were fortunate, in a way that many people haven‚Äôt been, to get a real life, real time, following orders rorschach test circa 2020-2021. Turns out a solid 75% (at least) are going to follow every order no matter how retarded, if it comes from a sufficiently recognized authority. Maybe more. And of the ‚Äúdissident‚Äù remainder, most will still at least make a pantomime of following orders when expedient and relatively painless. i.e. wearing the mask in the grocery store just to avoid hassle, since it‚Äôll all be over in a few minutes anyway. Which I too did at first. It does not matter that I was one of the first in my area to start going maskless in the store, nobody is keeping score I don‚Äôt think, but it makes me feel good. I digress. The 75%+ order followers figure appears to be written in stone and a fact of life.Speeding does in fact cause more accidents than any other one factor. That it is not punished as harshly as DUI is clear evidence of moral stigma about alcohol as manifested through the latter day temperance society rebranded as MADD. Indeed, driving while mildly buzzed (technically over the limit) is probably less dangerous than eating while driving, and certainly less than texting while driving. You gotta be more or less staggering/falling down drunk to be a true hazard behind the wheel. The disparity in punishment being a purely moral issue, as I said. Because orders.

            To be fair it was way easier to just put the mask on rather than get into a fight every single trip to the store.  But one thing I observed is that people will still passively resist.  I didn‚Äôt fight nurses but I always pulled the mask back down the second they turned their back.  Lots of people didn‚Äôt bother going to events where the true believers organizing them would eagerly announce that they would check vaccine cards at entry.

            MADD has really pushed the DUI standard into the absurd.  Even Candy Lightner, org‚Äôs founder, says this.  Here in AZ, as everywhere else, the limit for presumed intoxication is .08%.  MADD wants it lower and the penalties higher.  They never stop pushing that.  They‚Äôll never stop until any trace of alcohol equals proof of impaired driving.  They are indeed a temperance organization.  Women with too much time on their hands.In the meantime, published stat‚Äôs from our DUI roadblocks have produced interesting statistics.  Seems, the majority of drivers arrested are not only above the .08 level, but in the felony level of .15 and above.  A remarkable percentage above .2!The point I‚Äôm making is that at the level of .08, or below, there is really little problem and hence the .06 or .04 level will only ensnare a few social, ‚Äúdinner‚Äù drinkers.  It‚Äôs the problem drinkers, the physical alcoholics, who continue to drive that are racking up the accidents.  MADD is like the proverbial man looking for his lost car keys under the far off streetlight.

The robber baron‚Äôs cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated, but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.‚Äù~ C. S. Lewis

            More people speed than drive drunk.  Many more.    Speeding is naturally going to be the cause of more accidents.   Disparity in punishment is not a moral issue. Not wanting some slobbering drunk driving or even someone slightly buzzed, navigating our roads only makes sense.

                The issue, I think, is that the slightly buzzed and the slobbering drunk are punished the same, even though they present not at all the same hazard. And speeding a little bit on a sparsely traveled interstate is probably harmless. I didn‚Äôt mean to suggest otherwise.

                The problem is whether or not the buzz‚Äôd driver is inherently more likely than other forms of assumed impairment to be involved in an accident.  The statistics are out there, but I‚Äôve not seen them.  I suspect this is deliberate.  As I stated above, there is evidence to assume the major problem is with the slovenly drunk crowd‚Äînot the two beer crowd.  But the politics are against such a finding and implementation of law.I was being interviewed for jury selection once in a ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù driving case, but not selected.  What was interesting was the Judge‚Äôs address to the jury pool.  He stated emphatically that AZ law did *not* prohibit drinking and driving!  AZ law only prohibited driving while *impaired to the slightest degree*.I found this confusing, but in hindsight not so.  I suspect the defendant was charged with DUI, but had a blood/breath test less than the ‚Äúpresumed I,paired‚Äù level of .08% and therefore was going to make a legal challenge to the officer charging/testifying as to his impairment.Now that would have been an interesting case to sit upon.

                        No, I was not as hard nose then.  But coming from the University usually got me bounced fast.  Once I made it to first selection.  They asked if I knew anything about the such and such paper and pencil test for mental impairment (the basis for the disability claim and tort).  I said no.The author was faculty in another department and we knew each other.  This came out in some manner I forget, but the plaintiff‚Äôs attorney was hopping mad and was saying l lied.  Got hot, real fast.  The judge wisely stepped in and bounced me at no cost to the plaintiff‚Äôs 6 strikes.It‚Äôs not easy getting on jury duty for most cases.

            I remember I had a doctor‚Äôs appointment in one of those large medical office buildings. The old crone manning the front desk demanded I put on a face diaper. I refused, politely. She said she‚Äôd call security. I told her under no circumstances would I wear one of those useless bits of dirty paper on my face. She asked me my name and I told her it was none of her business.I walked off amid her shouts. I ended up exiting the building out of a rear entrance so I wouldn‚Äôt be confronted by the building‚Äôs security cretins.If you could‚Äôve seen how agitated she became when I told her I wouldn‚Äôt follow ‚Äúthe rules,‚Äù you would‚Äôve been shocked. Never mind that masks are useless. Never mind the mountains of evidence. Why these large health care ‚Äúproviders‚Äù insisted on masks everywhere even though they knew they were useless is a great mystery to me. Except maybe they were bribed by the mask manufacturers.

                My wife about a year or so ago had what may have been a sinus infection, an unfortunately not unprecedented thing. But, in order to unlock the Magic Scrip from our primary physician, she needed to see said doctor (actually, this meant feeding the Medical/Industrial Complex its money, given the past, well-documented propensity toward sinus infections in the winter, which made it rather silly). So, she dutifully presented herself to the receptionist at our local McMedical facility, but upon inquiry from this martinet about the purpose of her visit, she was huffily informed (and I quote), ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see sick people here!‚Äù, and told to return to her car for a telemedicine call from the doctor. She complied, because Resistance Was Futile, but this shit was unbelievable.Recently, I read a post describing how medicine has become militarized; doctor, now mere cogs in the machine if involved in corporatized practices, must follow orders like the good little privates they have become or face discipline.

        Here in France almost all of the speeding tickets are issued by radar.  The government recently changed the rules so that speeding only slightly over the posted limit involves only a fine, not a loss of points on the license, thus making the revenue raising aspect of traffic laws even more clear than they already had been.A more egregious example of the ‚ÄúNuremberg defense‚Äù than pointless speeding tickets has been in the coercive vaccination program.  ‚ÄúI was only doing what the government ordered‚Äù. It also was an egregious violation of the Nuremberg protocols requring informed consent for medical treatments.  The damage in human lives and health continues to mount as the full consequences of this disastrous program become clear.  (Embalmers are now seeing a new form of fibrous blood clot in veins and arteries that has yet to be identified by pathologists.)  If there is ever full accountability for this atrocity the courts, prisons and hangmen will be working double shifts.

            When I got a ticket in the mail for running a red light where there was a camera (in a ‚Äúfreedom loving red state‚Äù), it was made clear that if I just pay the fine the whole thing disappears like it never happened. But if I were to contest it in court, which is my right, and found guilty, then all the other consequences kick in, points, insurance etc. So of course I paid the fine. Since I was guilty as sin.

        I don‚Äôt know about Nazi Germany; none of us do unless we were there.  Was it some hyper authoritarian bug man sadistic slaughter state?  Maybe.  This is just what we‚Äôre told about it by people who hate us and have taken a hatchet to trad America.  But this is certainly a beautiful sentiment regarding police:‚ÄúWe loved him because he made our police force work for us, not against us. Our young learned that our police were not against us, but a necessary help in the establishment of a healthy society. Certainly, all available help was necessary to protect the honest citizens from the machinations of traitors, secret societies and minority pressure groups. We supported our police because they were German police, working for German government. Thus, we required far fewer police to ‚Äúmaintain public order‚Äù under Hitler than we do today, under alien domination.‚Äùhttps://www.jrbooksonline.com/html-docs/hitlove.htm

            This was understood in England during the development of a permanent constabulary.  As Sir Robert Peel wrote, ‚ÄúThe police at all times should maintain a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police; the police are the only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interest of community welfare.‚ÄùYet today, as is the case throughout the Western world, British cops are enemies of the public, preferring to charge white men with hate crimes for noticing that the Old Bill facilitated foreign rape gangs who preyed on native girls.*spit*

            Having a bit of background, but not claiming expertise, I always chalked up the German ‚Äúexperience‚Äù wrt the NAZI era as one of cultural Germanic, patriarchal, authoritarian upbringing.  Authoritarianism began in the home and logically was extended out to corporate and the political authority by such people.  My upbringing via a Northern European father was similar.

        I don‚Äôt mind cops following orders to ticket speeders as much as I mind cops following orders to NOT arrest rioters, arsonists, looters, takers bribes from foreign governments, and election riggers. Following orders to NOT enforce immigration law is a bigger deal to me than giving a ticket to some clown going 30 mph over the speed limit.

        I am the most amateur of amateur historians, so I am going to present my thoughts with the expectation of being corrected.Z Man casts Nazi Germany as a totalitarian state, in the same way that Bolshevik Russia or Mao‚Äôs China was a totalitarian state.My understanding of the experience of Nazi Germany for normal Germans was that you could live your life without interference from the state so long as you didn‚Äôt defend the chosen or Weimar degeneracy.  The Nazis were imposing traditional German culture and if you didn‚Äôt interfere with that, then you were left alone.To be provocative, I guess that most people who read this blog would have been perfectly happy in that situation, but you would have hated Bolshevik Russia or Mao‚Äôs China.Speaking of the present, if I had my way, you can do what you like as long as you don‚Äôt promote sexual degeneracy, anti-whiteness, immigration, or feminism.  If you do that, we may kill you.  What‚Äôs not to like?

The Nazis left you alone if you minded your own business. Part of this was possibly because they lacked the tech for totalitarianism. Without the tech you can only be authoritarian, The filing cabinets of the RSHA couldn‚Äôt do the trick. Part of it was also that the Nazis were smarter than Stalin, whose reign of terror in the 1930s seriously damaged the Soviet army, Soviet industry, and Soviet society. generally

            Some of the Nazi preoccupations were those of the pre-WW1 German elite: militarism, ethnic chauvinism, and Social Darwinism. I don‚Äôt think these would qualify as traditional German culture.

                To be fair, @RB, that was a part of the platform the National Socialists ran on. Specifically points 4-11. If you weren‚Äôt Aryan, you had the duty to self-deport, and if you won‚Äôt‚Ä¶.
Again, like someone above said, most here would favor something like that, if not the way the ‚Äúor else‚Äù turned out. And maybe even then.

            German politics was complicated. For a start, Germany (along with Italy) is one of the newest countries in Europe, formed only in 1871. The idea of a land for the German-speaking people (Deutschland), the origin of German nationalism, also dates from the 19th Century. The words to the song that became its national anthem ,i&gt;‚ÄùDeutschland, Deutschland √ºber alles‚Äù (‚ÄúGermany, Germany above all else‚Äù) was not about world domination, but a subversive song aimed at the petty princes and bishops who stood in the way of national unification, and could easily land you in jail.Even Prussia, around which Germany was eventually established, had a problematic relationship with the German people. The rather reactionary Junkers who governed that kingdom were deeply suspicious of the liberal tendencies of German voters, and deliberately excluded the Austrians, who were their rivals for dominance in what had been the Holy Roman Empire. Indeed, much of the the welfare legislation passed by the Reichstag was a bribe to win support for military spending which the prudent Prussians thought essential to avoid being swallowed up by neighboring countries (as had happened to Poland).Alas, Prussian militarism‚Äîjustified as it may have been from their perspective‚Äîcombined with pent-up nationalism to result in an absolutely disastrous foreign policy. Its personification can be seen in the person of Arthur Zimmermann, Germany‚Äôs one-time Foreign Secretary, who not only concocted the infamous Zimmermann telegram but also arranged the return of Lenin and his fellow exiles to Russia; thereby contributing to Germany‚Äôs loss in both world wars. Nazi Germany was a continuation of all these tendencies, albeit with even more grandiose (i.e. unrealistic) plans.

            Don‚Äôt feel bad Ann. Getting stopped by a police officer of A Certain Demographic if you‚Äôre White is a chance for them to exercise that big ol‚Äô chip on their shoulder. Had it happen to me with a State Trooper, a Chicago cop (I was a passenger in the car), and a local townie cop. Bad attitude and snark fully deployed at me. The State Trooper especially didn‚Äôt like that I knew state law about tinted automobile windows and that my car was street legal by Silly-nois law when he pulled me over for ‚Äúillegal‚Äù tinted windows (I bought the car used and the prior owner had the windows tinted).

            I don‚Äôt know what it is about leftists and their romanticizing the city and their love of all things sucky, like PT.But there is nothing about my politics that says I have to embrace the corporate suck of the empire and its bland and ugly sameness everywhere.  The opening scene of the video is a perfect example of the corporate ugly sameness. That stretch of road could be Billings, MT, some random town in Georgia or Washington state. It‚Äôs hideous and awful.The criticism of car culture isn‚Äôt exactly entirely wrong, but it‚Äôs also not right either.  There is a lot to criticize about car culture without being an idiot.  It‚Äôs gotten to the point that even well into the city, life without a car is near impossible even where it should be fun and pleasant.

                I think this guy gets a lot right. Part of the problem is zoning laws that prevent mixing shops with housing. Most people can‚Äôt walk to the drugstore or barber or church or corner diner anymore because of them. As a result, most ‚Äúneighborhoods‚Äù are just dormitories now. You don‚Äôt have to be a 15-minute-city lefty drone to hate that.
And I say that as a dye-in-the-wool car and motorcycle freak.

        The business of America is sucking up to the boss. Trump yugely capitalized on this with his promises to run America right‚Äîlike a real TV boss! Establishment-right rhetoric to undermine normie Trump support is *still*, after he was deposed by a coup and waits to be sentenced to life in prison, about how he didn‚Äôt boss hard enough, can‚Äôt delegate efficiently, isn‚Äôt a proper bureaucrat, can‚Äôt screen resumes, is rejected by ‚Äúgood hires,‚Äù etc.Relatedly, some dumb lady politician today proposed a $50/hour minimum wage. To restore the buying power of bottom-tier workers to the height it reached half a century ago, that‚Äôs about the right amount (low-end estimate). Of course it wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork.‚Äù A financialized economy doesn‚Äôt behave according to libertarian (or socialist) rules, so bumping numbers around doesn‚Äôt have ‚ÄúEcon 101‚Äù effects. The system is so thoroughly tilted against regular dipshits that mere politics can‚Äôt do anything to improve their standing in it. Even if wage increases caused inflation‚Äîthey don‚Äôt‚Äîthe benefit of inflation goes to the first spender, and wage workers are never that. Not even a legal mandate that their number go up would make it go up. Etc.The normie conservative comment section objection to the dumb lady isn‚Äôt any of the above. It‚Äôs that increased prices are an inevitable result of inviolable laws‚Äîex cathedra infallible, determined by Our (job) Creator‚Äîand nominally increased pay is a greater moral outrage than the Holocaust. Also it‚Äôll increase prices.It‚Äôs the most American attitude.(Despite their reputation, the Japanese are saner about this. Unlike us, their bosses aren‚Äôt *in fact* their cultural, political, economic, and biological enemies. Yet.)

        Having spent a few decades in bureaucratic organizations, I have come to the conclusion that they are sociopath-producing machines.  They even have ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù departments, nowadays.  Some Top Sociopath or Toady Sociopath comes up with some moral horror of an idea and insists it be implemented all the way down the line, to the least employee/enlisted man.  At every level, the implied threat is ‚ÄúImplement this on your subordinates or you will be replaced and left without income &amp; healthcare.‚Äù

            So true. I worked for a large bank for over 30 years. I ended up doing things I later regretted at the time and felt guilty about after I retired. I console myself by remembering that I had a family to support and did what I needed to do in that regard.

        Following orders in Nazi Germany should have been an allowable offense, at least by the peons.  Failure to follow orders likely would have led to court marshal and being shot.   Now the German state is even going after literal secretaries and security guards who did whatever it was they did at the German state‚Äôs direction under penalty of death or imprisonment for not following the order.  It is absolutely evil.
Many men were court marshaled by the US state for failure to obey orders and at least one was put to death during WW2. Nuremberg was nothing but victor‚Äôs vengeance.

        But in the total state, how could a counterforce possibly arise that would occasion disobedience to the orders? Other than attack from without, how would the totality be diminished?There‚Äôs a stretch of one of the two east/west highways that runs the width of my state (the other highway is an interstate toll road) where, for about ten miles, traffic is light enough to exceed the speed limit. Going back forty/fifty years, drivers were pulled over left and right. You could settle, on the spot, for a twenty that the cop would pocket or turn over to the DMV. Due to public outcry, the practiced stopped. It‚Äôs lately been revived but public protest is no longer a deterrent.As the auto insurance companies, via their raised premiums, are the main beneficiaries of this practice, they should, in conscience, kick back some of their increased revenue to the state. Maybe they do.

        There are lots of potential wrong turns on the road to redemption. The first is to fight on the enemy‚Äôs terrain and under his most favorable circumstances. The second is to fight your neighbor because old grudges and convenience. The third is to fight the LEOs and Praetorian Guard standing on line at the Citadel. The fourth is to fight mano-a-mano out in the open a la Braveheart. All of the above maximizes loses with almost no impact on the root of the problem. This is the harder way.Better is to choose the circumstances that are most favorable to achieving your goals. Chaos begets fog, which is a two-fer; it cloaks all movements and keeps the LEOs occupied with riot duty. The ideal Gray Man is never seen or interdicted because he is a nobody. Creativity and spontaneity are nearly unstoppable in the Age of Bureaucracy and following orders to the letter. This is the smarter way.

        Well, in Spain it came to an end pretty unceremoniously.The cops have their ways of enforcing conformity very early on, like in the academy and the probation period. Anyone not deemed a ‚Äúteam player‚Äù gets eliminated.While tickets have always largely been a grift, they got  tired of the inefficiency and just steal any money you may be carrying.  The average amount is extremely low, like under $500. The aggregate amount is many billions of Dollars annually.   I‚Äôm not sure when they started robbing people on the side of the road, but I drove to Florida in 1995 and a bunch of different people warned me not to carry cash because cops on I95 was infamous for robbing out of state vehicles.  I didn‚Äôt ever get pulled over, so I don‚Äôt know how bad it actually was.  Supposedly people from NYC, Philly, Baltimore and other East coast cities used 95 as a drug transportation system. At least that was the excuse for the highway robbery.  But it has since spread all over the United States.

                Yep, and profiling‚Äîwhether racial or not‚Äî*is* good police work.  It will always be with us as long as there are cops who are hungry for advancement within the organization.  All they do today is to wait upon a legitimate excuse before pulling you over.When I was much younger, I got to listen to an LEO presentation wrt drunk driving and detection.  One interesting statement was where certified (in detection and testing) police units spent their time.  The presenter said, when things got slow in other parts of the city, he always drove over to the university (my university) and picked up students.  He never had a moment of boredom as the students ‚Äúwere always driving drunk.‚Äù  ;-).  Now that‚Äôs a type of profiling too, right?

                    Profiling, as it was explained to me by a friends older brother who was a trooper at the time, is ‚ÄúAnything that sticks out of the normal goings on around you.‚Äù and he gave me an example:He said that where he patrols is blue collar and somewhat rural. I set up in a spot to run radar and watch traffic.

        If we‚Äôre honest, I think much of the skepticism, if not contempt, for LE is driven by the fact that they have no affirmative obligation to protect us. You all know the relevant court cases ‚Äì I won‚Äôt cite then here. When you combine immunity with lack of obligation, it‚Äôs a recipe for popular contempt.The St. George syndrome has partially broken the ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù concept, since the cops cannot enforce against certain ‚Äútypes‚Äù for fear of the Regime. This in turn channels more of their efforts into relatively easy BS like writing tickets to white guys without radar detectors/Waze. When you extrapolate this trend, it looks like Anarcho-Tyranny.

            They are in fact aware of this. When I went to traffic court, the cop there literally gave us all a speech saying, in effect, you are being punished because voters passed these laws. Which‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing a proposition on the ballot that asked if we should punish people for going 80 on a deserted freeway.Good thing about it is that there‚Äôs plenty of bargain tier ambulance chaser law companies that will fix it for you for 25% of the cost of the ticket. Premiums won‚Äôt go up for you either. At least that‚Äôs how it worked out for me.Anyway, many people get it. Lots of cops are retiring early or quitting since saint negro crime was honored with looting and pillaging. I‚Äôve had occasion to speak to some of the few that remain and a common thread is that the job isn‚Äôt an enjoyable one.I keep saying that we are living is a Sauron/Voldemort type situation, everyone knows something is wrong but most are too scared to confront it. And how could you anyway? It‚Äôs not like anyone really believes that our lawmakers are in any way beholden to their constituencies anymore. I think the only chance to change anything has got to be to spread awareness of the identities of the main architects of this 1984/Brave New World bullshit that we have been forced to languish in.‚ÄúGive me control of a nation‚Äôs money and I care not who makes the laws.‚Äù Mayer Amschel Rothschild, patriarch of the Rothschild banking dynasty.

        Thefatwaon use of the superior orders defense issued by Jews was only valid so long as they were trying to attain for themselves a place among the ruling elite. Once there, however, only slavish devotion to even the most immoral of actions became necessary to avoid bringing their unbridled fury down upon you. Putin recently asked Zelensky how he could ally himself with neo-Nazis in Ukraine when his Jewish father had fought against them on the side of the Soviets in World War II. But actually the behavior is quite typical. Seeing our political leaders pivot from the Russo-Ukrainian War to the Israel‚ÄìHamas conflict is like watching American Communists following publication of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact.

        Let‚Äôs not over correct here. The ‚ÄúI was just following orders‚Äù criticism can sometimes betray an understanding of duty. I spent some time in the Marines and sometimes you really do have to just follow orders that have consequences beyond your personal preferences or understanding at the moment. I suppose we should ask who is giving the orders, a badass colonel who cares about his men or a crazy Jewish woman telling you to wear a mask.

            RedBeard:  It is, as you say, very much a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, if White people as a whole stopped ‚Äúfollowing orders‚Äù and went Galt against DIE, the whole sh*tshow would grind to a halt.  Just as Zman notes, if Whites disregarded cops the way joggers do there wouldn‚Äôt be enough uniformed enforcers to maintain  anti-White anarcho-tyranny.On the other hand, when/if we ever have a White homeland, we will similarly have to be heavy-handed against any Whites who insist on questioning the foundations of that state.  No toleration of simply ‚Äòquestioning‚Äô White supremacy and racial separation.  No coddling of womyn who claim they just want a little bit of ‚Äòfairness.‚Äô It brings to mind C.S. Lewis‚Äô example in ‚ÄúMere Christianity,‚Äù  where he compares human society to a fleet of ships.  Either we all sail according to the same rules and in formation and towards the same port,  or the entire enterprise breaks down (witness AINO).Any society that permits the basic, foundational tenets of that society to be questioned and challenged ends up like heritage America ‚Äì riven by factionalism, foundations eaten away by termites, the ‚Äòbody politic‚Äô dying by ever-increasing hordes of parasites.  Some things must remain unquestioned.  There will always be someone questioning things that were answered or tried and failed eons ago.  You either shut them down ‚Äì hard ‚Äì or you find yourself right back in the middle of ‚Äòtoleration‚Äô and diversity.There‚Äôs a lot to be said in favor of conformity ‚Äì IF those in authority are one‚Äôs own people, with the interests of those people at heart.

                My rationale is-I can send my 9 year old daughter on her bicycle to the store to get a quart of milk at 7:30 PM at night and she returns unmolested, and I can sit under the trees in the city park without being stuck by abandoned needles, or be threatened by machete wielding weirdo‚Äôs, and I can express my opinion of our local school board without being inundated with hate mail, then I really don‚Äôt care what is going on internationally.

            Armed Attorneys are correct. Never say anything to LE directly. Always have a qualified attorney present to speak for you.
As for CBDC, that only works if TPTB can shut down all the exits.

                I remember seeing the Massad Ayoub video and I disagree with his advice.  If the police are there, best just to say that he will make any statement only after consulting counsel.  That‚Äôs what police unions tell their members and it‚Äôs good advice.
Your idea also makes sense if it‚Äôs feasible.  Just get out‚Äìif you shot a dirtbag the police probably will figure he was shot by a rival dirtbag and not look into it much;  But the prevalence of surveillance cameras in urban areas may make escape impossibe.

                    Ayoob is (or was) a cop. A small-town, part-time, cop, but a cop nonetheless.
Much of his advice is geared toward justifying shootings by cops and only incidentally towards armed citizens.  He got his start back in the 1970s, when cops genuinely feared getting indicted if they shot someone‚Ä¶ now they can pretty much light you up with hundreds of rounds and walk away scot-free (certain demographic exemptions being duly noted since the martyrdom of St. George of Fentanyl, of course).

                    Best advice I heard was to say nothing to police, except perhaps your identification.Here in AZ.  You can reserve your ‚Äúright‚Äù to remain silent (obviously), but that right must be openly stated/affirmed. You also by law have the right to request that you be treated as ‚Äúvictim‚Äù rather than suspect, but that must also be stated/declared openly.  You also must affirmatively request an attorney be present and by law further questioning must be stopped.Second best advice I‚Äôve gotten was that if the above doesn‚Äôt work and you‚Äôre scared and shaky and being basically harassed is to state you are feeling ill and need to be transported to the hospital emergency room.  Old farts like me can get away with a feigned heart attack no questions asked.  üòâ

                The way I‚Äôve been schooled on it, notify the police, and tell them only ‚ÄúThere has been a shooting incident‚Äù NOT ‚ÄúI shot someone.‚Äù Anything, anything, anything else beyond that, you say through your attorney.
In this age of surveillance and cell phones, you open yourself up to much worse by vamoosing. Shoot, shovel, and shut up was good advice for a bygone age but not for today.

            ‚ÄúHe is saying in the video that you should talk to the cops.‚ÄùI‚Äôll take ‚Äòworst advice ever for $1000, Alex‚Äô.I made this mistake at one time and it was costly. They are NOT, not not not your friends. You are a suspect and the enemy and they will always see you as such.Theyliterallytell you in advance what is going to happen when they Mirandize you, ‚Äúanything you say CAN and WILL be used against you in a court of law‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt get more technicolor crystal clear than that!We, Europeans, have this hard to shake idea that ‚ÄúOfficer Friendly‚Äù is still a thing. I don‚Äôt know how that is possible in 2024 but somehow it is.In the before time, this was true, but it hasn‚Äôt been the case since at least the Boston Marathon Bombing. Once you saw hundreds of police larping as soliders in Fallujah throwing people out of their houses, carrying grenade launchers, riding in MRAPs, etc. that should have shattered the illusion. The manifold videos of whitey being shot &amp; abused should have sealed the deal too, but here we are.

NEVER say anything to police. If a cop says they want to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you, know that the only way they can help you is by releasing you, immediately.

        this reminds me of the French intellectual  Rene Girard‚Äôs concept of mimetic thinking. basically it says all groups of people have loyalty tests where you must conform to the groups thinking , and that we are almost never able to resist the groups loyalty test, no matter how illogical of inaccurate it is . It also implies that over time most people will believe absurdities because they cannot go against them and yet they cannot endure the cognitive dissonance going along brings them.It sure explains how covid was used to take over the world, and why ordinarily intelligent people went along with it all.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgB9p2BA4fwandhere are a couple of clips of Rene‚Äôs . they are in reference to his catholic faith, but the ideas apply everywhere.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWsU5rXDFVcandhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m3x3pWTBHs

            Never was one to go along to get along, thought HS initiation was just dumb, didn‚Äôt care if I was liked or disliked, I had my own good opinion of myself, if cruelty was directed at me, my response was Meh, what else you got? Confidence is very attractive, and if people think you might stare them down, they wither. When the bullies knew I would give as good as I got, and they might actually bleed, or someone might laugh at them, they left me alone. Most folks just want to be liked and accepted and will conform to get it. I have outliers on one side of family back several generations, might this be a dna thing?

        After covid drained my state‚Äôs coffers they changed the rules of highway patrol so they can now prowl anywhere, not just the highway. So now they go &amp; compete with local cops for ticket money, where I live we a premium in taxes so my local cops are paid handsomely &amp; have no quotas but now we have these assholes harassing us nonstop. The state also invested in hiring more environmental compliance officers to go harass construction workers &amp; commercial trucks, everyone knows this is just another layer of taxes. Raising taxes isn‚Äôt politically feasible &amp; neither is cutting handouts to brown people who pay nothing into the system. Luckily for them the supreme court gave them chevron deference so all these ABC agencies can invent new rules out of thin air to justify new defacto taxes on people who actually work for a living.The worst part is it‚Äôs not just a simple tax but it‚Äôs essentially a welfare system in of itself for all the not tax collectors to have a salary &amp; pension. It‚Äôd be a lot cheaper to just send everyone a tax bill but we have to pretend this is all serious business that‚Äôs saving lives &amp; the environment.One thing we have going for us is the government obsession with diversity, hiring morons to do their bidding can only hamper their efforts. Here‚Äôs an example: one of those newly hired IRS agents accidentally shot &amp; killed another agent while training to use a gun.https://www.azfamily.com/2023/08/17/irs-agent-accidentally-shot-killed-by-fellow-agent-during-training-phoenix-gun-range/I never thought I‚Äôd agree with the line about diversity being our strength but between those diverse banks going under &amp; IRS agents shooting each other I‚Äôm beginning to see what they mean by that now.

        i was under the impression that speed cops were a thing of the past as it seems anything goes on the nation‚Äôs highways these days.  I see Sheboons with their faces buried in their IPhones tailgating  each other at 90 mph.  There are thousands of illegals driving  without insurance and half drunk.  Most traffic laws are  simply ignored it appears.   Driving in urban areas resembles Mexico City traffic more and more.  I want more traffic enforcement not less.

        At the risk of beating a dead horse, I notice it‚Äôs whites obeying and getting smoked for it. Not advocating outright lawlessness, but you have power and dignity if you choose to use them. Got picked for jury duty once, they showed us a video about our legal tradition. The law is on trial too‚Äî you are the law, in a sense, when you sit. We have a hybrid tradition, neither lawless nor slavish.Obeying is really stupid when the rule is you lose. And yes, I think there‚Äôs a religious element‚Äî a perversion imo. Something about climbing up on your cross to save the world. As if you‚Äôll resurrect and go to heaven too lol.

            I‚Äôm not advocating for avoiding jury duty but‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve never been picked for jury duty, although I‚Äôve been called up numerous times. On the questionnaire I state my place of birth (a state in the Deep South, which is true.) I say that my hobbies are reading about history, economics, business/finance, current events, philosophy, politics (true enough). I‚Äôm not sure, but it seems to me those answers aren‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for.

                Alternatively, I sometimes wonder if there‚Äôs benefit to playing dumb and then sabotaging the trial from the jury box.  You never know what you‚Äôre going to get assigned, but you might be able to spring a white person.

                        3g4me has not even touched the problem of deceit to get onto a jury.  For one, the judge can jail you for lying (there are recorded cases).  Two, your fellow jurors will rat you out if you don‚Äôt go along with the rest.  Just the mention of ‚Äújury nullification‚Äù and one or more fellow jurors will visit the judge and you‚Äôre dead meat.
You want to vote your conscious, fine‚Äîbut be very careful.  What goes on in the jury room is *not* confidential‚Äîit‚Äôs not a Confessional.  üôÅ

                    Wild Geese:  One caution. I used an out-of-state relative‚Äôs address as my ‚Äúhome mailing address‚Äù when I joined the government, so I could avoid state income tax while overseas.  This was almost 40 years ago.
When I was trying to get my personal info removed from some of the online aggregators recently, that address came up as somewhere I once lived.  Not saying the legal system is going to use this against you, but just be aware that info will be out there ‚Äì somewhere.

                    In my experience, both sides want blank slates.  When you give a one-sided opinion, even the side you are agreeing with doesn‚Äôt want you on the jury.  This was explained to me by an experienced trial attorney who was running voir dire for a trial my former company was involved in.  The reason is that people who are glib with opinions will turn on you quickly if it benefits them in some way.  Like if other jurors are voting the other way, and the glib guy want to get home faster.

            On a lighter note, in Portland Oregon apparently 40 percent of vehicles do not have current license plate stickers, so their solution is to write more tickets??

                You can really see this in large corporations versus small companies.  When I worked for a Fortune 500 company, I would arrange meetings to get a decision by senior managers, and come out with less clarity than I went in with.  When I worked for a small company, the meetings were much shorter and the owner was very clear on what action he wanted.

                        Hitler did win election in ‚Äò33 and old Hindenburg decided that his party with about a third of the legislature made him Chancellor.

Hitler‚Äôs ‚Äúterm‚Äù as Chancellor was extended (IIR) and then war started so there was the effective end of any semblance of democracy.

        Cops follow orders because it gives them a paycheck, status, authority and the ability to violate the very rules they are enforcing.What does a cop do to catch a speeder? He speeds. What does a cop do after writing you a ticket for using your cell phone? Uses his phone and computer while he drives. We are told ad nauseam by the gun controllers that NOBODY needs an ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù and that ‚Äúweapons of war‚Äù don‚Äôt belong on our streets ‚Äî except that now the cops all have AR-15s and 30 round mags even though they are not soldiers and not engaged in war.I have no problem with the cops enforcing the law, but the idea that the cops are above the law really burns my ass. Especially when so many of them are outright goons, morons and incompetents.True story: a few years back I was on the interstate in a pack of cars timidly adhering to the speed limit because a cop was coming up from behind. He blew past us all in the right lane in excess of the speed limit ‚Äî with no lights or siren.I figured, ‚ÄúHell, that radar don‚Äôt point backwards‚Äù so I got behind him and started pacing him. Seventy-five. Eighty. Eighty-five and he‚Äôs still pulling away. I figured ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough‚Äù and back it off. Then I saw his brake lights a half-mile ahead as he turned left into the median. Where was he going in excess of 85 mph with no lights or siren? To set up a radar trap!Back when I was a Reagan neocon, I thought the cops were the good guys. Hah! Now I know they are just a bunch of goons who get paid to serve The System and get off on having a license to get away with the very same things they will cuff us peasants for.

            Cops are the worst drivers. my uncle was a cop and I wouldn‚Äôt let my kids ride with him. he NEVER got a ticket. he would be stopped 2 of 3 times driving from Clevland to Miami but showing the badge always resulted in a friendly warning. If  someone passes you doing 80+ in a 55 , it is most likely and off duty cop. normies who regularly drive that way don‚Äôt have licenses. .

            What does a cop do after writing you a ticket for using your cell phone? Uses his phone and computer while he drives.Funny story: A few years back my Mrs. showed me a video on Facebook concerning a copper in our old home town. It was shot on a phone by a passenger in the passenger‚Äôs side of the poster‚Äôs vehicle. It showed Officer Donuts driving along with the driver‚Äôs window of his police SUV down, running at 45 MPH on the main drag in town, face down in the laptop facing him entering a police report. I believe the caption on the video was ‚ÄúReally safe huh, (Town) Police Department?‚ÄùTo say the Police Department was pissed at being called out was an understatement. As I recall they tried to get Fakebook to pull the video.

                Right on. I spent 20yrs in the Army and my last assignment was in Arlington, Virginia. I noticed immediately that the patrol officers were wearing and carrying nearly identical equipment to what I wore in Baghdad (minus the helmet).
If they dress like an occupation force, they are going to act like one.

            A long time ago I was bopping along on a turnpike in OK (not my state) doing about 95. My radar detector never went off at all and I happened to look behind and saw an OK state trooper coming up really fast. He blew by me like I was standing still. After that I diales it up to about 110 for the rest of the turnpike. You can cover ground like that.

                Careful about the turnpike.  Years ago as a youth, I drove the turnpike and had the turnpike ticket which they used to charged you for the mileage driven.

        It seems that the most socially effective commands are the ones that are presented to you not as orders, but options. There‚Äôs an ‚Äúoptional‚Äù wagie dance they have employees perform in the morning at Walmart. You can see the faces of the workers reddening as they go along, squirming, going from embarrassed to outright humiliated. Even those who try to do the dance ironically to defy it end up being its victims. As Joker discovered in Marines basic training, you can‚Äôt really be ironic or a comedian when you execute an order, even if you think you‚Äôre mocking it.There is a certain point, though, where a certain number of people just throw up their hands and say, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù I would rather sleep on a steam grate on the street than do certain things. Of course, the people in charge want everyone reading this blog sleeping on a steam grate, at best. They mostly just want us dead.I think of Polpot examining the hands of people fleeing Cambodia via the airport, and, when he didn‚Äôt find calluses, sending them to the rice paddies. Or the story of the Nazis taking professors in the nonsense sciences and handing them toothbrushes to clean cobblestones, so they might finally have something productive to do.It‚Äôs pretty fair and simple. If you want me dead or sleeping on steam grates (or at best, dancing and humiliating myself) I want you in the rice paddies or on the cobblestones.We‚Äôll see how things shake up here in the next year or two. Like a prison when it‚Äôs becoming a pressure cooker, I know a lot of people are watching for the boil over moment of reprisal when the prisoners can get some getback against the snitches and scumbags.

            Agreed.But if we were nations that were serious about driving, we wouldn‚Äôt have these asinine speed limits. Speed limits make sense around congested areas or schools. That‚Äôs it.The problem is that in North America, driving is a right. Are you a four foot chink fresh off the boat from Cambodia that can‚Äôt see over the dash board? Have a license ‚Äì just don‚Äôt drive too fast! Maybe you‚Äôre a myopic senior. Or maybe you‚Äôre a chicken headed housewife in a minivan full of screaming kids. In Canada and America, you can be a hare lipped retard and still get behind the wheel. The roads are literally choked with people that don‚Äôt belong there.We look enviously at the former Nazis of Germany for their autobahns. What most North Americans don‚Äôt realize is that those autobahns work because EVERYONE follows the rules. Serious speed is for serious people. In Germany, if you get caught poking along cluelessly in the fast lane‚Ä¶ you go into the chitter, and your license goes into the shredder. DUI ‚Äòs will usually net you jail time. Little daily infractions here are major offences there and are punished as such.

                And in today‚Äôs gynocracy, the answer to every traffic fatality is to lower the speed limit on that stretch of road.
Thank god 55 was done away with during the Reagan years.  Had it survived until recent years it would be permanently enshrined.  ‚ÄúMuh safety!‚Äù and ‚ÄúMuh gaia!‚Äù would prevent forever an increase in highway speeds.

                Totally agree that driving needs to return to being a privilege.
Expanding a bit on your last paragraph, Americans no longer seem to understand that traffic signals mostly exist to promote predictable behavior that provides a margin of safety for everyone, not as something put there for one‚Äôs personal inconvenience.

                Filthie:  While I was briefly waiting to get my license in my new state of residence, a very feeble old man came hobbling in with a walker, helped by his daughter.  He needed to get his license renewed.  Had gotten some sort of medical statement from his doctor that he was fit to drive.  He had to find and put on his glasses to pass the vision test, while his daughter commented ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt use your glasses to drive.‚ÄùAfter a couple of tries and a bit of prompting, he passed the test and got his license renewed.  And I later got a warning for exceeding the speed limit while passing someone.

                    Unfortunately in most rural areas or small towns, there is no reliable/affordable/ease-of use public transportation system that could get these folks out of their cars. Recent situation, a 90 year old senior low income man with no family nearby, had his only means of transportation ( a big old sedan) towed because he was driving without a current license plate sticker, which he could not afford or obtain, so now he is home-bound with no way to get groceries or get to medical appointments and no money to retrieve his car from the impound yard. When this article was posted in the local news online with the arresting officers name, he was excoriated. But he was only following orders. Common sense would have indicated that the officer could have let him off with a warning and a referral to senior services or meals on wheels, but have you seen the type of officers these days. Unwashed 300 pound high school bullies with ‚Äúfilthy mouths and bad attitudes‚Äù (thanks Penguin).

                        Believe it or not, the body cams don‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve mentioned a deputy friend of mine here before and he had no problem with the dash cams, but he told me that the body cams are a whole other problem. To begin with, they can be remoted in by a supervisor and the wearer will have no idea it‚Äôs going on.Add to that the fact that it takes away what he calls one of the best things he has ‚Äì discretion. He told me about a year ago there was a sgt who was in a good spot on the Lt‚Äôs list. This guy decided to show management that he could be a team player, so he informed his squad that they had better up their numbers. To that end, this guy started reviewing everyone‚Äôs body cam footage and started writing his guys up for letting people off with warnings. As a result, no more warnings issued, everyone got tickets. I was floored when he told me this.I couldn‚Äôt imagine working in an environment like that.I was only playing devils advocate here. My buddies been on that job for over twenty years and he‚Äôs told me that the newer cops coming on are virtual automatons and that most of them will follow orders without question.He told me that he asked one of them a question while he was field training the girl and she said something that gave him a little insight into the Millenials/Gen Z thought process, if you could call it that. ‚ÄúAll truth comes from people in positions of authority.‚Äù Is how he summed it up.And that, is pretty scary.

                    I was just talking about this with a cousin yesterday.  His mom ‚Äì my aunt ‚Äì is 93.  She‚Äôs quite fine mentally, but physically is showing her age.  He‚Äôs just got her down to his condo in Florida for the next few months and told her she‚Äôs not allowed to drive while down there.  Our grandfather lived to 94 and was likewise quite healthy the entire time, but on his 90th birthday he sold his car to another mutual cousin and called it a day.  He didn‚Äôt want to get to the point where no one was sure if driving was a good idea or not.

            The key feature of Anarcho-Tyranny is the who/whom distinction. The regime enforces law on either its perceived enemies or those it can extort (usually the same people). Allies or impoverished are exempt.
A better example would be the middle aged white guy winding out his BMW getting the book thrown at him, while the illegal alien drunk driver is not even processed.
Or the difference between the Floyd rioters and J6ers.

        I am glad Z brought up corporations as part of the discussion on following orders. A lot of people on our side of the divide complain about the government ruthlessly implementing insane ideas that backfire on the country. But being on Nuland‚Äôs staff is no different than being in any private company or NGO. You must applaud and you don‚Äôt want to be the first one to quit clapping. Even executives have to keep that in mind.All of this has gotten worse with the dominance of women and Jews in the upper ranks. Women can‚Äôt tolerate a man, especially if he is of the white persuasion, telling them one of their ideas won‚Äôt work. If the man is so uppity as to do that women will dedicate themselves to destroying the man. Women are also obsessed with a culture of everyone being positive and enthusiastic.One of the things that got me to retire from the corporate world was a conversation with the Exec VP of a major public tech company that was trying to recruit me. I asked her what she most wanted in her executives and in her best Valley Girl voice she screeched she wants executives who are POSITIVE AND ENTHUSIASTICCCC!!!!!I remarked that it sounded like she was recruiting members of the cheerleading squad not competent executives who could grow the business.

            Right after my experience with the Valley Girl Exec, I got together with a doctor I knew. He had gone a few days earlier to a mall coffee shop and in walked some marketing managers and directors of a famous tech company. They set at the table next to him so he decided to snoop. He said they were all early 30s. Looked attractive but everything they said was bland, short and mundane. He said in nearly an hour he didn‚Äôt hear anything suggesting these people could think and had original thoughts. Knowing nothing of the corporate world he didn‚Äôt realizr they were selected precisely for those bland traits.I guess where I am going with this is that the whole American culture and institutions need to be gutted and for there to be a restart. Nearly everyone at the top or managerial class shouldn‚Äôt be there in a sane society.

                When I used to commute to the hive for corporate job I would pass the dial through NPR. The lispy uptalk and vocal fry and whispery effeminate nothingness was unbearable. Just white noise of anti-white.Back then my office was full of ongoing conversations and meetings dissecting complex situations, banter over various data and modeling, strategies and problem solving techniques in a kind of community resource well from which we all took and contributed because we were also all doing the actual work.Fast forward and now every corporation sounds like NPR and related, the ratio of people who get paid to talk vs the actual people doing actual things is totally inverted.My wife‚Äôs company has endless meetings, always some ‚Äúteams call‚Äù and when I hear what passes for business talk I feel like I‚Äôm back in junior high surrounded by mean girls. From the CEO on down. A vernacular culled from ‚Äò80s motivational posters and current year gender studies departments. Disgusting.Totally unrelated, her company is perpetually failing to meet profitability and thus the core business, aside from corporate equivalent of gay pillow talk, is raising more capital to burn. It‚Äôs all ponzi. And like Fonzi, its already on the other side of the shark but everyone just keeps showing up for ‚Äúwork‚Äù.

            &gt; Women are also obsessed with a culture of everyone being positive and enthusiastic.
Toxic positivity. As uncomfortable as it can be, sometimes the only way to get to an answer is to let a few crusty old experts walk into a room and knock the solution out, regardless of hurt feelings or yelling. The soft consensus talk only ensures the safest solution is put forward. Not the best one. Not the necessary one.

        ‚ÄòThe ‚ÄúNuremberg defense‚Äù was treated as worse than the alleged crime. The argument was that if you follow immoral orders then you are worse than someone who thinks the orders were moral.‚ÄôI read Arendt‚Äôs ‚ÄúEichmann in Jerusalem‚Äù decades back and if I recall correctly she examines the defence of ‚ÄúI was just following orders.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs where she coined the phrase, ‚Äúthe banaility of evil.‚Äù If memory serves, she was contending that Eichmann ‚Äî as a relatively junior functionary ‚Äî was indeed just following orders. Again, if memory serves, when the Americans started their ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù program in Germany, they distinguished between different levels of fealty to the regime. An ordinary Joe just going along with the regime to survive wasn‚Äôt treated the same way as, say, a concentration camp commandant. I forget the labels used to make the distinctions.I also remember the experiments Stanley Milgram conducted in the late ‚Äô60s, when he discovered that most people generally follow orders from authority. It‚Äôs a minority that does not.If Biden and Graham are ever arraigned before a criminal court (dare one hope?) their defence will undoubtedly be, ‚ÄúI was just following orders.‚Äù They deserve the same fate as Ribbentrop and Kaltenbrunner.

            Interesting about Arendt‚Äôs writings.  You could be right about them.Maybe this is getting somewhat OT, but the more I look into ‚ÄúDenazification,‚Äù the more disturbing it appears, especially in the western version.  Academic Agent had a very interesting video recently about how Frankfurt School ideas were heavily incorporated into the American-led process in Germany, to make the German people feel collectively guilty, and to pin blame on traditional German culture, family, and centuries of history, rather than focussing on enacting justice with individuals who committed actual atrocities.  This seems to have contributed to today‚Äôs terrible situation, in which combined with massive immigration and low white birth rates, it might take a miracle for the real German people to survive into the next century.Interestingly, the Soviets after WWII apparently didn‚Äôt come down nearly as hard on German traditional culture, family and history.  Their goal was more to promote socialism rather than transform the German people.This doesn‚Äôt necessarily negate what Arendt described, but it adds a horrifying element.

Since Jews were behind the Nuremberg trials, I daresay they were behind the denazification program in West Germany as well. And of course they were behind hunting down prominent Nazis for their show trials. American goyim were a clueless lot in all this (seemingly). On a side note, and for the few who don‚Äôt know, Arendt was Jewish as well.

                ‚Äúand to pin blame on traditional German culture, family, and centuries of history‚Äù
Yes, this just sounds correct. The idea was to eradicate the old Germany and the old German, and replace him with the New German, and more generally, the New European, an ersatz version of the American, with no history or culture. And with regard to Germany, this program has been successful. Just look at the current Chancellor, the GAE‚Äôs unterscharfuhrer, Scholz.

                    Arshad Ali:  And with books like The Authoritarian Personality, the same actors have been pushing the same kind of destruction of American whites, for several decades now, with such little pushback.
Of course we all know about that here, but it‚Äôs astounding how little resistance there was, with books like that in clear sight, and with the terrible implications.
Sorry, I just can‚Äôt stop shaking my head about it.

        Ahh, Z.  You got out of that megalopolis shithole and found the freedom of the road.  I feel the redneck swelling within you.  Make your own wine and dehydrate some venison and your journey will be complete.
How to break the trust in the rules, and in the currency.  That might be the keystone.
