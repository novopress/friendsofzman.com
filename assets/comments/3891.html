            Hitler was a very weird person. One of the things I used to enjoy doing to the Taki crowd was posting the link to the story about Hitler being gay. Whether or not he was, in fact, a homosexual, is unknown, but he was certainly not a normal man in that regard. That was probably the least of his problems. On the monster scale, I’d say Stalin, Lenin, Pol Pot, Mao and some others top Hitler. But, Hitler was still a horrible wart on the face of humanity.

        Speaking of, shouldn’t the Constitution be made part of Godwin’s law already?
Because anyone bringing it up seems to also become a laughing stock…
