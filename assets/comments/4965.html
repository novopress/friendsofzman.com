        “What I’m reading in the psychological case notes is compatible with my own impressions,” Berman continued. “The psychological case notes indicate that while Mr. D’Souza is highly intelligent, he has remarkably little insight into his own motivations, that he is not introspective or insightful, but that he tends to see his own actions in an overly positive manner.”
Pot calling kettle black?
Berman sounds like the text book example of a guy who always knows what’s best for other people. And his stated motivation is only that he wants to help.

        By calling him insane, you give Berman too much credit.
He’s a political hack who is using a web of words to camouflage a partisan mugging of someone on the “other side”.

        I am so over it. “Dinesh D’Sousa”..? It couldn’t happen to a nicer guy. There are countless nobody’s that get fucked over every single day in the courts of the former US of A. He’s getting off easy. A quality jurist would send him straight to the wall without a cigarette.

            People forget that D’Souza was a PC hitman who went after Sam Francis. Francis brought much of his troubles on himself, but D’Souza volunteered to take him out.

                Well, 1995, so forgetting is understandable. Unless we are talking about a different “Crazy Uncle in The Attic”.

        The left believes that anyone who doesn’t hold their opinion to be clinically insane. It’s mass delusion that they cleave to irrational blather and call it “normal” and “truth”Men sodomizing each other and rolling the dice on HIV and Gay Bowel Syndrome are noble and pure in left think.D’Souza made the heinous error of not being entranced with the Boy Leader, the Water Walker, Barack the Magic Negro. By pointing out he was a cheap, spiteful little Chicago ward heeler, with a sub-par intellect and narcissistic personality disorder, D’Souza guaranteed he was psychologically unfit to walk among us.

        Berman’s not unhinged, his opinions are unhinged. Place him smack dab middle of Jewish intellectual thinking. The difference is that he has both power and immunity. That is a brew that will degrade a decent ideology and metastasize a bad one.

        I may be overplaying it a bit, but one of the scariest things I have ever read.  “Guilty of holding positions in conflict with those of the Authorities!”.  I’m 55, and throughout my lifetime such thinking was solely comedic fodder,  going back to high school and Monty Python’s Spanish Inquisition.  Our modern world is sooooooo over that, we all nodded.Then came the laughable jailing of the “Innocence of Muslims” filmmaker for parole violations.  (Laughable to everyone except Mr Nakoula.)Lately I have been thinking that, given my health, family history and whatnot, I have  about three decades left, the last one to be spent mostly in a Lil’ Rascal, of course.  And boy am I glad.  I figure that should just about coincide with the witching hour, when things completely fall apart.  I just hope everyone goes into Dean Smith stall mode until then. After that?  As the preacher says to Bart early in Blazing Saddles”:   “Son……..you’re on your own.”    (Obviously I do not have kids.  For those of you who do – I’ll be with you every step of the way.  But one man can only do so much.)Meanwhile, somewhat ironically, I see that at this very moment MSNBC has a panel of legal talking heads earnestly debating the Colorado Theater shooters’ sanity, which is for modern legals scholars the  equivalent of midieval Papal courts debating angels on a pinhead.

        “Looming” is a strange synonym for “fifty years of crackpot judges.”

            We seem to be hitting a critical mass. For all of my lifetime, there were enough sane judges on the bench to keep things under control. Nuts like Berman were left in the state courts where they could do less harm. We’re at or maybe past the tipping point where the nuts are in control and the sane have to keep their heads down.

        The Soviets wanted people to be seen as insane because they often disagreed with Communism, or rather, disliked the dictatorial style of the Soviets. It was obvious to all the defendants were insane: they couldn’t see the perfection of Communism and didn’t worship the elite so they had to be nuts.
