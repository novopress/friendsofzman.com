        “Like all systems, this one most likely is carried on by internal forces until it collapses.”   But human organizations yes including the French Ancien Regime, including the USSR…we can go on…and add the Tsar in 1917…do not simply collapse. No more than Nazi Germany ‘collapsed’ in the spring of 1945.No more than the Confederacy collapsed.
They will not ‘collapse’, something must topple them.Even Yarvin admits this…he recently begged in a column the Deep State something someone to throw down the Cathedral …
The myths of 1989 will not die until we do I fear.

        Much more than physical threats, the ruling class would be aghast of a thinking, reality-aware, critical mass of citizens. 30% would be a critical mass. But people like that, even with the Internet, can be at most 1%.The rulers have nothing to fear — certainly nothing from the citizenry.

        Everyones’ heads are so far up black ass there is no hope in righting this shipOnce they embraced all things black, they sealed their fate, and the country’sI was surprised at even the Gov and SoS of Georgia signing on with Stacey Abrams.    A clear-thinking man would never get in bed with someone like that and let her call half the shots.  That state will NEVER get back being run by clear-thinking white people.  Georgia is doomed.Rather, I posit that the only things that could possibly shake up the status quo are either/both a brain drain and a tax revolt/stoppage by white working people.  If America were faced with a competing country luring and attracting talented white people away with incentives and citizenship, then America would have to compete finally in a real way with other countries and have to do like employers do and raise wages and perks to retain their best employees and executives.  But America and the IRS currently have people over the barrel.  But if it ever changes, then it might and probably definitely would rattle their cages and make them get serious again about being a serious country.   But that means throwing blackness overboard.  One or the other.A tax revolt or extended “sick” day that extends into weeks or months could do wonders.  But like Reagan with the air controllers, they might just “fire” those Americans and bring in a bunch of scabs in the way of massive foreign employees and team up with corporate America and blacklist those Americans form ever working in a big company again.   And the clock is ticking on that front anyway.  If it is going to happen, it would have to be soon.

            That is how Europe got its welfare state,  They had to throw bones to people to not get on ships.  You never know, some European countries may want to replenish their white stock, but they would have to go through a radical political change beforehand, which they very well might.  I still see Europe as having a better future than us simply because they have an extra 20 years or so to right the ship, even after what they’ve done to themselves.  Europe and European cities are simply nice places to be (not all of them).  Dallas, on the other hand, or insert American shit hole, will be a patchwork of aging cinderblock Costcos and ugly, backlit signs advertising hand jobs, and slums full of mud people, as in the movie Idiocracy. We’re already 60% there.   What we need to keep in mind though is that in the next couple years we’re facing a 2008 like crisis again, only on steroids, and we’re going to emerge from that for the most part without a middle class, and the aging boomer-con IS the middle class.  Something like that will bring radical political changes, and we can only benefit from that.

            The extended sick day is what the Left/Woke/New Communists just did to US in case you missed it.  They also exempted practically everyone from work, let them loot every major city, shot thousands of people, and mailed $600 a week to all their essential worker unemployed minions.  Finally, they ended bail and stopped prosecuting most felonies and opened the border to allow millions of people who already hate us to waltz right in.I think what you are missing is that they do sincerely want to elevate black people to full participation in every aspect of life.  And they are doing it by any means necessary.They have done all of this in both Europe and America with hardly a grunt of protest from the “Right”.  Every Billionaire in the US and Europe is willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars as often as possible to keep this going.  They really do want Stacey Abrams to be an important figure in national politics and to show the world that a black woman can lead.  They are investing in that even if she isn’t a perfect vessel.  Like how Moses got a leg up from God in spite of his faults.

            Stacey Abrams is a Yale lawyer, and has been a member of the CFR for 15 years, joining the team just before her election in Georgia. She’s also a director at John Podesta’s Center for American Progress in DC and “a strong supporter of Israel”.

            Problem is that the USA is still the top anglosphere country for the educated class. USA is fucked – but salaries vs. cost of living are still much higher compared to AUS/NZ. UK is a tyrannical Islamic island.Canada might be the worst of them all, with horrible weather, high taxes, insane housing prices, and apparently fully open borders with the 3rd world.USA will continue to attract talent from all over the world. There’s simply no other country with so much money, opportunity, and land for educated professionals. I predict you are going to see an influx of Canadians in the coming years, so watch out…

            A financial collapse will also do it. However,  total financial collapse/hyper inflation wouldn’t be a guaranteed victory for our people. It would be a free-for-all where we COULD come out with a place of our own. However, we could also end up being the scape goats of the collapse For some new black communist regime. I guess I’ll take my chances.

        Trump will not understand the gravity of his winner take all situation until the cell door clinks behind him and the prison guard walks away.  In that hour of silence, and quiet sobbing, he may finally understand that he wasn’t playing a game of self promotion.  The stakes were far higher.  And he blew it.

                Trump is an actor, as you say. But it is fantasy to believe that a disorganized mob could really “sack the deep state”. That  would end about like the last scene in Monty Python’s “Holy Grail”.
Holding that big rally in DC on Jan 6th was a tactical blunder. His fan club could have rallied anywhere else and avoided being suckered into the predictable PR fiasco at the Capitol.

                    That’s the flip side. It would have been worse if he DID make the call and the fat Boomertards made some farting noises and then left the city. There’s a high probably of that being the case.

                    No way.  If Trump would have the call, tens of millions of people would have joined in from every walk of life.  I think even the military would have.  But the FBI, CIA, NSA and their media network broke Trump’s nerve.  It cost them trillions of dollars and almost every city saw looting but they won.

        It’s the way of all things. Trees are like this, too; once they grow from sapling to maturity, they can’t be moved, and can even die from too heavy a pruning. Eventually their roots grow until they’re overextended, them they weaken, rot and finally crash down. Everything that can grow will ultimately meet it’s demise. Thoughtful pruning can delay, but never prevent the inevitable, and it appears our tree is past the point is intervention.

            I have stump grinded trees out of my yard and they still find a way to grow back. Plants are pretty amazing.  Their ability to thrive and not be denied is something we could learn from.  Where they get that energy and commitment and perseverance and fortitude from is beyond me.  Comparing their will to live and thrive to ours is embarrassing.  I suppose as far as nature is concerned, they’re the top and we’re the bottom.

        “If the political class begins to fear for their life, then maybe they begin to act to push that inevitability off into the future.” – Generally, what happens throughout history is that, in a fit of hatred against their subjects, they open-fire to “teach a lesson.”   So the next January 6 event (the darkest day in history) they’ll have the Capitol Police open fire, and it’ll be a Kent State event on steroids.   And the Capitol police will do it because that’s what police do, both for their pension checks and because they like it (your beloved “thin blue line” securin’ the homeland).  And it’ll be a big mistake.

        &gt;&gt;Like all systems, this one most likely is carried on by internal forces until it collapses.&gt;&gt;Us New Lefties were thinking this way as far back as the late sixties. (I know: most of us got co-opted.) But it only makes sense. I expect the fifth century Romans were akin to the eighteenth century French nobility in this respect. Casanova’s brilliant (and very long) autobiography (he was an early contemporary) foresaw exactly what was going to happen and he urged reform to no avail.This is why, if I were a “race realist,” I’d head for the hills and look to begin, insofar as possible,  a commune, community, call it what you will, to live through the coming tumult as well as might be possible. The preppers, as free as one can be from limiting ideology, are the ones who best see what’s coming.

        In the case of big time college athletics, in the late 1930s, University of Chicago President Robert Maynard Hutchins decided that big-time college football and the university’s commitment to academics were not a good fit. The University of Chicago abolished its football program in 1939 and withdrew from the Big Ten in 1946  Rather surprisingly, the program had been very successful; Jay Berwanger of the U of C was the first Heisman Trophy winner and the team was coached for years by Amos Alonzo Stagg.  There are a few people who can take the long view!

            Half of the commenters here want a revolution; half want to talk sports and movie trivia.
The opposing team is Corporatism. Their sports and movies are a diversion. Why waste effort on those instead of studying the “real game” instead? We can’t hope to score in this game if we don’t know who the opponent is, who the players and team owners are, how they are organized, or what’s in their playbook. Just file the fantasy revolution in the same bin with fantasy football.

                Robert M. Hutchins of UC was also president of the “Fund for the Republic”, created in the 1950s by the liberal Ford Foundation. Many of the directors were members of the Rockefeller Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Every president of the Ford Foundation since 1950 has been a CFR member.
Nearly every key player on the “Biden team” is also a CFR member, including the secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Homeland Security and CIA. How’s that for the “long view”?

                        The amusing thing about the CFR, Davos, etc, is that the elites run their conspiracy out in the open.  If they didn’t do these things they and their lower tier pod-people would still have it out for us; pointing out CFR membership is pointing out the obvious.

                        Thank you for saying it.  As if any of us would have even the remotest possibility of impacting the CFR.  I had an uncle who used to go on and on about the Trilateral commission.  It got old.  He seemed to think that his knowing about the Trilateral Commission was some kind of big insight that he discovered as if it was a new element in the Periodic table.  But he was a bit of a moron.  And a drunk.
We all inherited a ton of gold coins when he died though.  So that was a bonus.

        Systems are difficult to change or to remain dynamic because over time you have so many people who profit from the system. They have no desire to change the system; in fact, they actively fight against changing the system because it threatens their livelihood.The top bosses could be pushed out or certainly lose much of their power in a new system so they don’t want it. Then, there are the hordes of lower ranks who could lose their jobs and, frankly, are pretty comfortable where they are.Even if they understand that the system can’t last, there’s no incentive for them to embrace change. Just ride the gravy train as long as you can. Why get off early?

        My goodness! What a lot of devoted readers Zman has. In the time it took me to read MY THEORY OF EVERYTHING and comments, part 1, you already have a bunch of comments on this post. My comment is that I had the same experience of thinking I and my late husband knew what was going on in Show Biz when I was a fashion model and he was in theater and on a soap opera in NYC. Then we did our time in LA, and realized we had never known anything of how it really worked in Hollywood. We were there in the Nineties, just as the changeover from Hollywood studios having to be profitable to Hollywood studios being vanity projects for large corporations was in progress. One thing became obvious, which might add something to this conversation. What we observed was that every time an interesting new show was being considered, they would give it the lead to Scott Bakula, who had never had a hit. Of course, obviously, he was the choice of a committee because he completely lacked any talent, other than being bland and not getting in the way of the scenery. But ultimately, it was worse than just choosing Mr. Nobody. It became obvious over time that the way it works in a dying industry is that success is anathema to the corporation, because success challenges all the higher ups and puts their jobs at risk. Success is the very last thing any corporation wants, so the rule becomes kiss the ass immediately above you to stay employed, and avoid a hit at all costs, because it makes you look smarter than your boss. Perhaps this partly explains the Trump phenomenon. In the business world where you are in control of company, as Trump was, you must succeed or vanish. Trump came to DC and succeeded, in spite of the sludge of intractable government. He showed up the complete incompetence of everyone and everything in DC. Anyway, enjoying your blog immensely and am heading back to My Theory part 2. Thank you.

            I always wondered if there was some kind of unofficial Official Hollywood Rule Book where that was Rule #1: So-and-So is the It Boy or It Girl, and will be cast in every single show until he either ages out or becomes popular. I remember this phenomenon in the late 90s, when for some reason they seem to have decided to make a blandly pretty blonde girl named Gretchen Mol a star. A few years later it was a blandly pretty blonde guy, Simon something, who eventually becameThe Mentalistor something like that (I’m probably messing up the names, as I haven’t watched tv in years). It makes more sense now.

        “Like all systems, this one most likely is carried on by internal forces until it collapses”.My guess is it goes like Hemingway state about his bankruptcy: gradually, then all at once.The ‘gradually’ phase of our particular system is close to the end.  The ‘all at once’ phase is well nigh.

            Tell that to whites in South Africa. Or even California or New Mexico.
There’s no reason that this situation can’t keep going for a very long time. Sorry for the black pill, but that’s the truth. Of course, the system could collapse in a decade. Who knows.
Best to start forming our own communities. That works no matter what happens.

                Thanks for this. I find that this is the default position of so many people because they can’t imagine it can last because of how broken it is. I am guessing Soviet citizens in the early 20s didn’t think it can last, several decades later they were proven wrong.Preppers are sort of the top of the heap on this. Not all of them mind you, but a sizeable majority are the “Any day now” variety. This is leaking into normies heavily now because we live in odd times. Since things have been stable for decades they simply don’t have the historical memory or IQ to realize that ‘really fucking bad for decades’ has been the default position for much of humanity going back to inception.When you live in a gilded cage where you want for nothing and the trains run on time you just can’t conceptualize life in Zimbabwe, until Zimbabwe arrives. We are hurtling towards it and since Rhodesia hasn’t been a thing for a good while it is clear Zimbabwe, South Africa, the USSR, etc. have LOTS of mileage before they collapse.This is the blackest pill none dare swallow. Your children’s children will look at 2021 and pine away for the good old days of Antifa/BLM as they toil in the dirt paying their 2/3rd salary ‘White Tax’ to their dusky overlords. Hoping to not catch a beating or rape on the way home, hoping they win the medical lottery to get that surgery they need since all healthcare is denied to Europeans.I could go on… there is much speculative fiction about this looming dystopia. “From Her Eyes a Doctrine” explores it in some detail before it veers off into romance novel. On our current trajectory this long slow misery is our future, not collapse. Of course, anything can also happen, unforeseen events alter history’s flow all the time, but don’t ‘wait on Superman’. He isn’t coming. (or Jesus for the religious nuts, I am also seeing more &amp; more of this in places like Breitbart, etc.) Plan for what is ahead of you, not what you wish to be ahead of you. God helps those who help themselves and all that, innit?

                    Apex,
We’re both right, but we both need to remember that history isn’t a straight line.
My white pill is that just a tad over a century ago, Whites stood astride the world. We’re were so beyond the rest of world technologically and organizationally, we were almost like aliens.
No one could have imagined that we could be defeated by non-Whites.
Our situation might look hopeless at the moment, but things change. Just keep plugging away and hope that opportunities present themselves.

                JohnWayne:  Climate wreaks havoc on those who try to prepare for the unexpected.  Here in the DFW area I can’t store much of anything in the garage due to the June-Sep heat.  So no safe place to store even an emergency few gallons of gas for a generator, stabilizer added or not.  All food and water must be kept climate controlled.  Even when I checked into putting an older fridge in the garage I found it would cost more to run than it was worth because of the heat.  Add in a poorly-built mcmansion with minimal storage space, and it puts a real crimp in my style.

                    3g4me:  Few points.Gas has a shorter shelf life than propane, even if you use stabilizers and buy pure gas – w/o ethanol.There are foods, canned, dehydrated for example, that can be stored for a long time. Do you have a cool dark basement? Start a garden. Raise chickens. 3, 4 chickens you’ll get eggs every day.BPA free plastic water storage containers. Calculate how much bleach to add.How large is your property? Maybe feasible to dig a well? Nearby creek, far from any industry? Filter &amp; boil. Connect a rain barrel to your gutters.Bourbon. The higher the proof, the better. Those big glass bottles good for storing water too! 😬Good Luck!

                        John Wayne:  Thank you for all your hints.  I do actually scan numerous ‘survival’ or ‘prepper’ websites, so understand the ideas and theories, but lack the location or resources to do all I’d wish.  No basements in DFW because of the clay soil.  No chickens in my woke ‘burb.  We yearn to ‘bug out’ to a rural area and are trying to acquire sufficient resources to do so as soon as possible.  Until then, I do what I can – and gripe online!

                    A dual-fuel (propane and gasoline) generator with enough power to (maybe) run your ac and fridge a few hours per day runs about $1k (outside of hurricane season, in the 8-10kw range).  A 100-120 gallon propane tank runs about $500.  Propane is heat expansive so you’ll need to adjust for storage, but it can keep the lights on for a few days, and propane is a lesser-demand “panic buy” than pump gas.

        It won’t be long now. The odd angry shots are being fired as we speak.
I speculate for fun, who will fire the angry shot that would set off the fun and games. At first I thought Kyle Rittenhouse. Then I thought maybe  the ape that shot Ashli Babbit might have.
Regardless, our aristocrats are stupid, weak, and craven. Disposing of them will be incredibly easy when the time comes. Do we have the men that will be needed to replace them?

Be careful what you wish for. Consider the French revolution and what happened during the “reign of terror”. It was the “woke” mob of the day that took charge, chopping heads and butchering conservatives by the thousands, only to be followed by dictatorship of Napoleon.

                        He was at war with foreign powers for the entirety of his reign, his protectionism ratcheted up the cost of living for citizens while reducing the foreign market for exports, and lots of men in the primes of their lives were killed or maimed. It wasn’t as terrifying as the revolutionary period, but it was deadlier. Governance was fairer and taxes were lower, but there were lots of foreigners all over the place. It’s a pretty mixed bag, and wasn’t great for anyone, except Talleyrand.

                        Napoleon caused lots of deaths and destruction (mostly because the aristocracy of Europe despised him).  In one sense, he was a disaster for the common Frenchman.
Then again, have you ever been to Napoleon’s Tomb?  To this day the French don’t apologize for Napoleon as do, say, the English for Imperialism.
In their souls, men aspire to great things, to be, or be led by, a great man.  “Most men live lives of quiet desperation “…indeed.
Napoleon brought out the best in men, even if it destroyed them, and the survivors (and their progeny) love him for it.

Am I jumping the gun when I imagine BLM and Antifa smashing up synagogues this summer? Did Uncle Schlomo finally overplay his poker hand?
So, “who will fire the angry shot that [will] set off the fun and games”? Man, there are just so many easy guesses, along with a few possible black swans that none of us have considered.

                I break with the dissidents that dismiss the prospect of the looming second civil war because there are two many factions, and they are too dispersed to make formal battle lines and areas of conflict impossible.Blacks are too chaotic and too stupid to fight a structured war on their own. I believe we will see the next civil war take shape in slowly escalating local brushfires. The jews may be the first mass casualties as they have been key figures in ginning up race conflicts and exploiting them.  Growing numbers of whites and blacks are beginning to see that, myself included. I used to be a staunch defender of Israeli policies and take their side when conflicts arose. In three short years I have reversed that, and many other normies are now doing it too. If you have to ask the JQ, chances are you know what the answer is.If I had to bet, I see the jews going down first in the next civil war, closely followed by the blacks. Whitey is probably going to prevail, possibly in partnership with the orientals as race realities re-assert themselves after the S has hit the F.

        “The ability to look down the road, to see several moves ahead, seems to decline in human organizations as they evolve.-When faced with millions out of work, they did not think about the long term impact of their remedy. They just started throwing invented money at people. ”Not enough money? Enpixelate more. Crisis remedied.The government decided that daylight-savings time could boost productivity so they ordered clocks changed biannually. If that actually makes sense, along with increasing the money supply, why not make more hours. Make the day 48 hours long.

Recent conversation on Jab Passports and grocery store admission requirements. That moment when “papers required to shop” becomes the law, it will be game on.We’ve been conditioned to provide papers in other areas (traveling in particular) but nothing focuses resistance like a child’s growling stomach.

        The transfer portal issue is interesting.  These players are recruited under the impression they will all be stars.  It used to be some would have to spend two or three seasons as backups before they got their shot, and some never really did as they were replaced by younger players recruited after them.  Up until this year players who transferred had to sit out an entire season which reduced the number willing to do it.  Now if a player doesn’t get a shot to play immediately he wants to bolt for another school.  This is a one time only rule, so they can’t move to a different team every year, but it has still drastically changed the sport.

            It is a fun thing to study. The system before liberal transfer policy forced programs to recruit and develop. Now the coaches have less incentive to develop. They can shop for player developed by others. Something similar happened with college basketball when the NBA started poaching their talent. Development and training came to a halt for most programs.
It’s a microcosm of our society. Player development is analogous to social capital. In the case of sports, development is being converted to immediate cash and the athletes pay the price.

                State college football and basketball coaches are often paid more than the governors. This is the reverse of common sense.When a college coaching opening is available, it should be advertised and the position given to the candidate that is willing to pay the school the most money to coach the team. Since almost every male in the country thinks that he knows more than the coach at his favorite school, there should be many applicants. But some applicants would have a higher likelihood of success than other. They and their friends could organize, purchase the position and then, if the team wins, the coach could move along to the riches of a position with a national contender, shared with the organization.Hard to believe that this system hasn’t been put into practice.

                        A very low percentage. The whole concept of the stoodint-afflete is preposterous. 90 percent of college basketball players don’t give a dam’ about getting an education, and probably 75 percent are too stupid to do legitimate college level coursework, anyway. They are simply basketball mercenaries using their scholarships as a springboard to a professional basketball career. Whether they’re playing for State or Tech is almost irrelevant to them. They’re just looking for the best platform to showcase their skills before scouts.

                Yes the social capital could survive when everyone was subject to the same threat-risk-reward of the development model and the team culture was valued as an integral part of its quest for success.Being displaced (or potentially) as a Senior by a hot freshman recruit was indeed a big deal, but that also served as an internal motivating factor to keep up your game.That freshman could supplant a “program” player who had paid his dues but that hot freshman would soon enough also face that same challenge during his tenure.Competition between groups needs competition within groups to matriculate the talent to the positions of greatest impact. Iron sharpens iron.Where this social capital (“team cohesion”) breaks down is when mercenaries are introduced and the team culture is replaced by the win at all costs culture.Transfers have always been a risk in terms of undermining the culture and motivation of a squad, but also served as a second onramp for players who may have been undervalued initially or otherwise did not fit in the narrow bandwidth of recruitment or a particular program. The also helped fill unexpected gaps due to injury or “off field” issues like retardation and violence.Once mercenary culture is accepted its only a matter of time before the economics follow suit and the incentives and exceptions are codified. Then the reversion to the short-term, fungible, and “velocity of talent” mean. Which really does mirror a lot of the culture at-large.

                    I wonder if the inevitable Title IX lawsuits will finally force college football programs to be come de jure what they already are de facto: Just the NFL’s minor leagues. Back in the days I used to joke about my “libertarian” position on college football.Since you always hear stories about big time programs offering scholarships to kids who are still in junior high, I joked that the NFL should simply hold a nationwide draft like baseball does, with kids straight out of high school. Then assign them to whatever program fits their “potential.” A first round draft pick goes to Ohio State or LSU, a mid-round pick ends up at a place like Louisville or Oregon, the late round flyers become Western Kentucky Hilltoppers or Louisiana-Monroe Warhawks.Since the whole trannie thing will destroy women’s sports, and women’s sports only exist via Title IX parasitizing men’s sports, sooner or later *something* will have to change, so… why not?

                        I used to defend college sports. But that now feels like defending 1984 America against current year Progress; its irrelevant.One thing progress has done is to converge everything into the same corrupting force.College Sports is a minor league option market scam for media and pro leagues.But “Academia” is a leveraged loan scam lubing the propagandizing of our children against us.The entire enterprise is rubbish.Short of burning it all down it should be stripped to the bare minimum of academics and research.The reat can be accommodated by clubs and  leagues by the “private free market”.No kid today will experience what I was able to back then anymore than they know of that America or that their people are not actually racist inperialist thieving oppressors.College is no longer institutions of “our people”. Their troubles are their own. Our trioubles should be to keep our kids away from them and build up our own fledgling institutions.The Title IX stuff was a 40 year warning: we are coming for you.

                One side effect of no-fault transfer is that the players now have almost all the power, and the coaches very little. Hence, if a coach dares to impose discipline on his players or offends them in any way, they can simply transfer out. Or, in some cases, they will try to get the coach fired. Creighton’s Doug McDermott almost lost his job because he used the word “plantation” when criticizing his players. Coaches have been emasculated. And basketball without discipline becomes an unwatchable thing. The quality of basketball at the collegiate level is about to decline dramatically.

                I played basketball for a commuter school that wasn’t in the Power 5 because the bigger schools really weren’t interested in a 6-4 white point guard, except as a “preferred walk-on,” which meant I paid my own way. They also weren’t enamored with my desire to go to engineering school and not be funneled into one of the crib “athletic” majors that even an 85 IQ guy could pass and stay eligible. Their reasoning was that playing basketball at their school was a full-time, year-round job (constant workouts, film sessions and off-season “unorganized” team activities) that overtook school. And every coach said that they liked that I was a “gym rat” and a “student of the game” (code for slow white guy even though I was actually quite quick), which was the kiss of death.The only schools that offered me a full athletic scholarship were the smaller directional schools regionally and one school in California, which was a shock. The coach who got me didn’t exactly like that I was going to be an engineering major, but when he saw my ACT score, he didn’t have a problem with it either.I stayed close to home and played four years, three as a starter. I was all-conference the last two years, won our conference’s academic student athlete award and honorable mention all-conference my sophomore year.Now if that happened with the transfer rule, I would’ve played a year at my alma mater and some big-time school that gave me the cold shoulder as a prep basketball player would be begging me to transfer.The problem with this system is as you said, the need to develop prep kids into collegiate athletes is obliterated and replaced with a free agent market no different than the NBA or NFL, except no pay is involved. The smaller directional schools like the one I attended will become like Double-A for the power conferences. It will be an analogue like college football is a feeder minor league for the NFL. Coaching at a smaller school will be like a JUCO in that your team will completely turn over every two years, ruining continuity.My junior year, we had a great run as conference champions and were a shot away from upsetting a team that sent 4 guys to the NBA and played deep in the tournament. It was because we had years of continuity playing in our coach’s system and we had flushed all of the turds in the locker room (or they’d flushed themselves). We had played together so long that I swore we could read each other’s minds on the court. People thought I was being a showboat with no-look passes, but when you know that your guy is cutting to the basket as he’s done a thousand times before, it’s a low-risk play. Same on defense when you know the help will be there without a spoken word.That won’t happen now. There will be no Cinderella teams in the NCAA Tournament (which I no longer watch) because continuity is the one thing the smaller schools had over the bigger schools with their one-and-done rosters.It’s an analogue to society in general that every reform seems to create more problems than just keeping the status quo. I think much of our problem is that we have too many people who don’t understand that sometimes doing nothing is the correct choice. They can’t imagine that there will be unanticipated consequences of reform. Maybe it’s a make-work scheme for these social experimenters because they always have to fix the problems created by their previous meddling.

                    Excellent post. I would offer one caveat to it, though. While it’s true that most of the better mid-major players will jump to Power Six schools, or the AAC, A10, etc., you will also see some players from big schools who weren’t getting any PT transfer to the mid-majors. I agree that, on the whole, no-fault transfer helps the power programs and hurts the smaller ones, but that phenomenon may not be quite as dramatic as we think.

        College football is a racket where libtard administrations profit in the billions by destroying the bodies of their “athletes” for very little cost.  My neighbor played football for Mizzou.  I see him hobble down his driveway every morning to get the mail.  He is in his early 40s and has had his hip replaced, and is awaiting two knee replacements.  All for a few tens of thousands in saved tuition and a little glory, while the university makes millions for its bloated bureaucracy and crap studies departments.

            College sports are useful microcosm. The hyper liberal colleges operate bloodsports, played by blacks, while keeping the cash At the same time they bemoan middle-class whites trying to hang onto their communities. The same college presidents then blame those whites for the school not hiring black coaches.

                Don’t forget that they’re all uber-feminists, too! I had a buddy who went to undergrad at the University of Iowa, home of the famous Pink Visitors’ Locker Room. He told me that, predictable as sunrise, that was the outrage du jour at the start of every football season (you’ve probably heard of it; ESPN used to drop the same story every fall, if the Hawkeyes looked like they might crack the top 25).My buddy’s running joke was to point to the injured list and the campus crime blotter and say “so….that’syour problem with the football program?” It stopped being funny about 20 years ago, but it’s still instructive.

                In the post-St. George deluge, colleges are now scrambling like mad to hire black coaches. I predict that in less than 10 years the majority of college head football and basketball coaches will be black. And that won’t be because of a sudden outbreak of competency among black coaches.

            It will be interesting to see what happens to football over the next 10-20 years.  Youth participation rates have been dropping rapidly, as more parents don’t want their kids to end up like that for a very short time in the spotlight.  I have thought the first domino will be smaller colleges in the lower levels will start to drop their programs.  The University of Hartford recently announced they are going down to NCAA Division III for all sports.  Some others in Division I may decide they can’t afford to keep up financially and try to drop it.  The problem with that is, they will no longer be in compliance with Title IX if they do, and male “student athletes” will be able to sue the school.  Most just keep looking for short term solutions like Z mentioned.

                I believe the NFL will turn into a more violent version of the NBA.  Whites will be smart enough to see the negative cost/benefit of a possible few million earned in the NFL vs. a lifetime of brain damage and other disabilities.  It’s a return to slavery, with the only difference being a small percentage of the slaves will earn a lot of money that by their 60s, if they are still alive, will not remember they have.

                    Most NFL and NBA players blow through their career earnings, with the help of family and “friends” within a few years of ending their careers.  At some point the money will start to decline.  Boxing was the most popular sport in the country in the first half of the 20th Century, now it is almost nothing.  Football appears to be on a similar trajectory.The NBA is trying to develop international appeal, particularly in China to make up for a total collapse of their American fan base.  The NFL has had very little success developing an international market.  People tend to grow up to be fans of sports they played as kids.  If kids aren’t playing football, the fan base is eventually decline.  Gambling is propping up interest already, if people get bored with that the whole thing falls apart.

                Over the short- and maybe medium-haul, I predict football will become blacker and basketball whiter. My reasoning is this. Black mammies care far less about their sons than white parents. And if one of the mammies’ seven Ja’Quariuses has even the remotest potential to be the next Lawrence Taylor and make plenty ducats, she’s dam’ sure not going to scruple over him getting his brains scrambled on the gridiron. White parents will be far more cautious about letting their sons play football. Instead, Caleb and Brayden will be encouraged to play basketball and baseball.

            I am the last person on earth to defend academia in any respect, and I’m sure not doing so now. That said, college football players are hardly victims. They know the risks, and they are well compensated for those risks. (Four years of college plus room and board is typically worth six figures these days, and that’s not even considering the dramatically improved earning power should the player use his noodle and actually graduate.) You puts down your chips and you takes your chances.

                Six figures for a degree most of them will never use in exchange for brain damage and permanent disabilities is not much of a deal.  I realize they are agreeing to the bargain, so not much sympathy is due.  It’s just funny how liberals who claim to love blacks are always the ones using them for power and profit.  Reversing that sentence reveals the game: Liberals claim to love blacks to cover up that they are using them for power and profit.

                    The AWRs push black sportsball because they know black success in sports was one of the keys to inculcating Hutuphilia in this country. And the AWRs really do worship the Hutus. It’s not just some sort of a con. They hate whites and adore their opposites.

        In a stable society 80 year old men plant trees the shade of which they will never sit under. We haven’t been that in awhile.
We’re leaving a niche opening for a society that is more “fit” in an evolutionary sense then ours. The populations that get displaced by expanding species rarely do well. A study of ecology can be illumination on the human condition,

            Indians will take over North America. China will be strong in Asia but East Asians are bad at operating in a non-homogenous environment. As Z has mentioned, the J’s are actually dying off. Whites are not great in diverse environments and are also too weak to deal with the blacks, insane liberals, and other minority issues.I suspect Europe may end up closing its borders to non-whites in the future. If so, expect a large number of educated North Americans to head back. Rural and prole whites will stay as the rump of Heritage America, perhaps mixing with lower class Hispanics.Obviously this is conjecture. But I have no doubt that Indians will be on the top of North America.

The saving grace is blacks tend to avoid rural settings.  Also, every small town has their insane liberal but as long as they can keep them out of the school system, containment is possible.
It’s also a plus that federal enforcement of the poz in the country is much more difficult, which is why there’s going to be a harder push to depopulate the countryside.

                Indians aren’t as smart as we think they are. Right now we’re seeing in the US what’s skimmed off the top of a very large population. Meanwhile, back home, they haven’t managed not shitting in the streets.
There will be regression to the mean, and a diluting of the average Indian IQ as more lower class/caste Indians migrate, if the official enthusiasm for mass Indian immigration continues.

                It will be a mix of Indians (on top as they don’t have qualms with tribalism), other eastern asians, and clusters of other high IQ people like Nigerians.If you follow the now infamous Antonio Garcia Martinez he makes a joke how in his team at Facebook he was the only American citizen, despite all the b*tching about muh diversity. He has a pic of his team that are all Asians but himself.There are some R&amp;D teams at Intel where being Nigerian gives you an edge, and most IT teams are famous for their cricket teams and fondness for curry as a condiment.This gives still some space to other high IQ europeans anyway so I do not think it will be the end for all europeans. Mostly the middle class will pay for it, but being full of sh*tlibs they will deserve it in some way. High IQ individuals have less to fear IMHO.But this will be survival of the culturally fittest too, and our culture is for losers so this is what we can mourn, that future America will be culturally Asian/Indian and average European-Americans will have to fight for the scraps. But all self-inflicted for giving into the narcissism forced into them in decades of snowflake mememe education.There is no reason for Harvard to not discriminate against Asians, but thanks to fake conservatives and libertarians even con inc is pushing to end discrimination against them to get rid of affirmative action. But we’ll get affirmative action 2.0 with preference for high IQs and whites will be at the bottom. Thanks Ted Cruz!

                Dude. The solution is well-known and has been implemented in many southern neighborhoods within living memory. It merely involves a little unpleasantness and re-definition of what kind of people we are.
The minute the frames shifts from, “I’m a nice guy,” to “I am defending my neighborhood,” everything changes.

            In a stable society 80 year old men plant trees the shade of which they will never sit under.I have three large red oaks which provide an almost solid canopy. One of those trees I planted a year after we built the house in 97. It was a tiny, one gallon “charley brown” tree that was barely taller than the container it came in and I didn’t even stake it. I was shy of my 47th birthday. That tree is now taller than my house. The other two I bought and had planted as (IIRC) 10 gallon trees. Got those from a.nursery in w.little town west of San Antonio. The nursery offers what they call their “shady deal”. If you buy one or more shade trees, for $50 they will transport, plant and stake the trees for you. I bought 2 red oaks and a monterrey oak. The red oaks went into the backyard while the monterrey went into.the front. All are now taller than the house. I.was in my early 50s when I bought those trees. I am approaching 70 and it would not occur to me to plant another tree now. If my kids (or whomever they sell the hkuse to after the wife and I are gone) want more trees they can damned well buy and plant them.Years ago I read that a man should do three things in his lifetime; build a house, plant a tree and raise a son. My house (built from.scratch by a contractor but to my specs) is almost 25 years old. My son is 52 (his sister is 40). The scraggly 1 gallon “charley.brown” red oak I bought from Home Depot in ’98 is taller than my house and almost as tall as the 2-story house next door. They want this old codger they better know I ain’t going down easily. But I’ve checked all the boxes. Bring it, by god! b&gt;Bring it!

                I found a little red oak seedling planted by a squirrel in a state park mow zone.  I dug it up and brought it home.  Planted it in the backyard.  It had three little leaves at the time.
It is now 16 yrs later and is flowering for the first time this spring.  It is taller than the house and provides some really nice shade to sit under.
And the people who built Notre Dame knew they would never see the finished building.
Nobody does it like that anymore.

                Lovely. I have always wanted to build my own house, and in the next five years I wouldn’t bet against it. On trees, I took a cutting from the branch of a willow from a local pond a couple of months back. Put it in a bottle with a bit of water and it rooted at around the same time as my second lad was born. It’s in a pot at the moment, but it’s growing like crazy (probably too big for the pot now).That’s the great thing about trees, both hard and soft, the cuttings are easy to strike. Who know, maybe in five years I’ll have a solid little willow to plant next to a stream or pond on my land. On the other hand, if things go south, I’ll plant it, strong and sturdy, next to the foundations of some wokeist’s house.

                    I did not actually build the house, per se, but we had it built to our specifications. It is in that sense that I say that I “built” my house. As I intended for this house to be the last place I ever lived, I made sure to make.it senior friendly. All the doorways are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. The shower stall.in the master bath has a very low step-over. There is only a low step up to the threshold of the front door and less than 6″ at the back.door – i.e. easily and inexpensively ramped if needed. As I am approaching 70 (2 months) and we both are developing arthritis in our hands, last month I (while I still had the manual.dexterity left to.do it) did something I had been intending to do since we built the house. I replaced all the door KNOBS with handles. You do not need to twist a knob, merely put your ha d on the lever and push down. Closing a door is very easy also. You just put your fingers behindmthe handle and pull. No.need to actually “grab” anything. I planned this back in my 40s.

        The governments have been found to be illegitimate. Blue states are now scrambling to re-open as enough people simply stopped following the insane lockdown rules. If you set a bunch of rules that nobody follows, you are a joke.Regardless of what the polls say Canadians and blue state people are now going out. The good diverse people never followed any rules to start with and are continuing to operate business and parties under the table, as are rural people. Throngs of people flood the parks and streets every day. Highways are pretty full. They bullied a few churches into shutting down.Canadian politicians are too stupid to even understand how this power dynamic works. The Quebec government (only one that’s not completely insane) just announced re-opening soon and people will be flooding to Quebec. The pandemic has convinced me that we are in fact ruled by shortsighted, self important, and incompetent morons.The West is now an ungovernable diverse shit hole just like India. This is sad, but also presents many opportunities for our side to skirt the rules.

            “Blue states are now scrambling to re-open as enough people simply stopped following the insane lockdown rules.”
Speaking for the California experience, it’s not people getting tired of the lockdowns. It’s people getting vaxxed then assuming the rules no longer apply to them.
The whimpering, teary-eyed relief with which Covidians get jabbed with the Pfizer Of Youth must be seen to be believed.

        You can see evidence everywhere of the people in charge creating a problem every time they try to solve one, and not just in the economy. I’m noticing, for the first time ever, news headlines online that talk about Palestinian casualties, especially the children (this dead baby technique worked wonders for the refugee rackets in Europe). My guess is that the change is due to all the Ilhan Omar-types the rulers have let in (not just to the country, but to the media and political ecosystem). Their hope was that these people would make life miserable for normal whites, which of course they do, but they’re also too stupid to make a distinction between Jews and other whites, so now the organ grinder’s having his eyes clawed out by his own capuchin.

                B125:  I look at the Daily Mail online’s pictures of Jews and Muslims fighting in New York, and it reminds me of photos of Turks fighting Kurds in Germany.  Import alien enemies and import their grudges and wars.  May they all erase one another.

        &gt; Notre Dame would be just another cow-college if not for the use of ringers to make their football program famous.
Notre Dame also famously broke with the Catholic Church in the 1960’s in return for institutional respect, and many other Catholic Colleges followed suit.  They literally sold their souls for a seat at the table.

                But Sean Astin (whose actual.father was Desi Arnaz Jr.) made an entertaining film. We Whites tend to root for the underdog. The story of a no-talent wannabe who spends his time as a human blocking/tackling dummy appeals to beta (and gamma and delta and omega) males and even to romantic females. That it is pure fairy tale is irrelevant.

                    Re Sean Astin’s father. It seems even worse than that:
“Astin was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of actress Patty Duke (1946–2016) and Michael Tell. However, at the time, it was erroneously reported that entertainer Desi Arnaz Jr. was his biological father. During that time, Duke also had a sexual relationship with Michael Tell, a writer, music promoter and publisher of the newspaperThe Las Vegas Israelite.”
Las Vegas Israelite, man.

                        Damn! I did NOT know.that. I knew that John Astin had adopted Patty Duke’s illegitimate son but I never read about that Tell guy. It takes a special kind of guy to raise another man’s son as.your own. I did it but only because my wife and I were infertile so adoption was the only way we could be parents. My son was 9 1/2 when we adopted him. We.took.our daughter home from a maternity hospital in Tokyo. I could not love either of them more.if they had been born to me!

            “Place at the table!”  I recently watched “the program”, a ‘90s era film about a D1 football program and the various power struggles and shadowy elements at work in holding a team together from year to year.Its not a good movie per se, though it has its moments. Like the quote above, when a roided-out former third string player earns his starting position as defensive end by gaining 25 pounds of pure muscle over the summer and is in an obvious state of perpetual aggressive roid-rage.When the assistant coaches question Lattimer’s sudden rise to dominance the head coach, a smarmy James Caan, responds “its not our job. The NCAA has a drug policy…Besides, its totally possible for a guy to gain 25 pounds of muscle over the summer if he hits the gym real hard”.The money, from the top down, drives the culture. From just looking the other way and not wanting to create problems or impair performance, to covering up actual crimes, to the duplicity of college leadership playing along when it suits them and claiming academic integrity when it doesn’t, its a pretty fair view of the mess.Its interesting to me, as a former college athlete in the early ‘90’s, to first see the morally bankrupt culture of college sports and then watch as that mercenary culture of win at all costs, winner take all, money is everything, become the culture in whole.
