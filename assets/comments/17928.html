        “In America, the Right used to rely on Christianity, tradition and America’s frontier culture, but those were abandoned as the Left anathematized each one in turn.”Yes, and again, yes. The “Right” has no coherent ideology. Even as some traditionalists on the right tries to invoke Christianity as their moral guidepost they ignore that most modern white, middle-class Christian women (the ones politicians care about) are Christians only when it’s convenient. They’re fully on board with all the leftist catchphrases and fashionable causes as they flip back and forth from Oprah to The View.Sit in a modern office environment and all you’ll hear is white hens (and wannabes) clucking about “diversity”, “recycling”, “gay marriage”, “white guilt”, or “LBGTQUVXYZ…” as they engage in their own “moral peacocking”.This is as true, if not more so, for the Christian women as for the non-Christians. The former sense that their Christianity makes them potentially reprehensible (shall we say “deplorable”) to the rest of the henhouse, so they go to extra lengths to show that they’re just as “moral” as the rest.Meanwhile, the churches keep on feminizing and “progressivizing” (the Booby says it’s a word), and the “men” keep obediently following their little wives to church every Sunday.

            Protestantism is the beliefvthst you can go back to the bible and find all you need in religion. It’s a common thing in religions. Unfortunately, that belief in the bible became belief in a personal jesus. Which becomes the Christians-who-dont-go-to-church phenomenon. Which means that they take their personal feelings and make it their own version of Christianity. Even pastors are not immune to this.

            Most ostensibly Christian men are in abject terror of their wives and most pastors are likewise in fear of the women in the pews. They know who writes they checks they depend on and so they tiptoe around so as not to make the church ladies mad. There is a reason Paul was so adamant about gender roles in the church and the home.

                Yes, and that’s how the early Christians Christianized Rome so rapidly and effectively, and it’s how the modern left has progressivized (the Booby still says it’s a word) the modern West.So long as the fashionistas of Hollywood and academia (the new church) are on board there’s no stopping it, unless the men collectively put their feet down. Take a hard look at the Christian “men” of today, trembling in their pews, next to their power-drunk wives. Think they’re gonna put their feet down? Screw ’em. They’re reason the left won, not our salvation.Why any man would remain a Catholic, for example, under the current Oprah-fied Pope is beyond the Booby’s understanding, yet here we are.Send your wives to church by themselves. What? You’re afraid you might get divorced and get cleaned out financially? Guess the game’s already over, then. Nothing left but irrelevance and extinction for what still remains of the West.

                    “Why any man would remain a Catholic”
Because leaving would mean helping the enemy. There is still significant opposition within the Church against the liberal wing represented by the Pope. The fight is not yet over.

                        Thx, Hun.  Aside from that, Catholicism is STILL true and STILL is the basis for Western civilization–until it began to collapse around 1900 or so with the Russki and Austro-Hungarian Revolutions.

                            That’s the bottom line.  Either it is true or it isn’t.  You stay because it’s true, and if you’re wrong about that, you live with it.  You leave/don’t join because it’s false, and if you’re wrong about that, you live/die with the consequences as well.  In the end, its truth or falsity does not rest upon you’re joining or not.  Nor does it rest upon some loon who gets thrust on the Chair of Peter.

                    That is why I am strongly considering a switch to the Orthodox Church.  Leadership is not nearly as cucked and the theology is substantially similar.  As a bonus, there is a strong element of ethnic nationalism within Orthodoxy.

                        Orthodox Churches are broken down by national lines and you might feel like an outsider if you are not a member of their nationality.  The Antiochan Orthodox Church has gathered many converts, even though they are based among Levantines.

                        I have been to several Orthodox liturgies and recommend it, in general. It would probably be good to talk with the priest and visit as you will likely have no idea what is going on for awhile. There is a strain of mysticism that I don’t like in some parishes as well as a focus on monasticism, but in general I like it. The midnight Pascha service is over 3 hours long. Don’t make my mistake and make it the 2nd service you ever attend.

And that is a major plus.
I would have great hesitancy about making a significant bequest to either a Catholic or Protestant church, as you have next to no idea exactly how such funds would be used (e.g. to import Somalis to your hometown).
With the Orthodox, there’s a bit less befuddlement.

                Not to pile on the much maligned white male, but most men quite willingly abdicated their spiritual leadership role.  It was mom who agitated for family church attendance and religious formation of the young, even in the halcyon days of the 50’s and early 60’s (in most cases and from my observation).  The last thing an overworked man wanted to do on Sundays was to get up early, put on a coat and tie again and haul his family to church.  Can’t a guy ever relax?

                    The halcyon days of the 1850s and 1860s, you mean.  American men have been complaining about the pussification of Christianity ever since Cotton Mather shuffled off this mortal coil.  In the long view, the judges at Salem were totally right — hang a few “witches” every now and againpour encourager les autres.

                            Maybe men didn’t push for prohibition, but they certainly passed it.  The 18th Amendment passed before the 19th.  Funny, after the 19th Amendment came the 21st.  I think you got it bass-ackwards.  People are always going on about the WCTU and Carrie Nation and never mention the Anti-Saloon League or the Prohibition Party.  “From the formation of the Ohio League in 1893, this dedicated group of men wielded increasing political power until the culmination of their efforts resulted in the 18th amendment to the constitution becoming law in January 1920.”  Who had the real power in 1919?Leaders of the Anti-Saloon League,http://www.westervillelibrary.org/leadersProhibition Party-men, men, menhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/prohibition-party

That’s a cartoon, friend.  Ever notice that that “fact” was spread by Hollywood comedies and New York fiction writers?
In MY home, and those of my friends, Dad went to church, happily.  And in my parish, there were 2 dozen men who showed up every day for a 6 AM Mass, too.

I knew two such men in recent years, although one was of another generation.  And I know many more who did/do not make church attendance a priority.  Simply an observation from lived experience.  Statistics seem to back up this observation.  You were fortunate to grow up in a home and community of godly, committed men.  The feminization of the church is a vicious circle.  As male attendance declines, even fewer males want to attend.https://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/22/the-gender-gap-in-religion-around-the-world/https://blog.capterra.com/where-are-all-the-men-exploring-the-gender-gap-in-church/

            it used to be that you grew up in the family/community church and that is where you learned your morals and relationship with God. Your family was Catholic, so you grew up Catholic. Your family was Lutheran, so you grew up Lutheran and so on… Now, you figure out what YOU believe, then shop around for a church that best fits those beliefs and call it home…as long as the music is good, the espresso bar serves good coffee and you aren’t bored. Your church is now a reflection and statement about YOUR personal beliefs.I recently got to experience a couple of modern (very popular with the young adults!) churches during a visit back home. They both were exactly the same, with really cool blue concert-style lighting and set-design, high-quality musicianship (seriously!) and dynamic pastors who talked like motivational speakers and only occasionally “skirted” around controversial issues. You know, they’d allude to things, without actually making definitive statements. In short, a big, feel-good-about-yourself, hands-in-the-air pep-talk.Left me pining for some of that ole’ time religion.

                You can still find those “ole’ time religion” congregations. But they don’t advertise the fact that blacks, gays, and feminists are not wanted. You have to find them by actually attending those churches and getting to know them. It’s a relationship of mutual trust. Once they know you, they will open up. I don’t know how many are out there, but I suspect they’re mainly in the west and south.

                    Last church attendance was a Weslyan church down the mountain.  Preacher was a Vietnam vet and a general contractor and actually built the church.  Everyone else were tradesmen and vets so it was a good fit.  Most anything else church involved was protesting fags and abortion and visiting prisons.  And fixing old churchs on the reservations.Have not attended since the old guy retired.  Down in the canyon they are holding church in the old feed store and it looks like everyone is bringing horse trailers and picnic lunchs and rifles.Might have to start getting up early on Sundays again.

                “Now, you figure out what YOU believe, then shop around for a church that best fits those beliefs and call it home … Your church is now a reflection and statement about YOUR personal beliefs.”It’s not clear what you are arguing for. Should a person have to stay faithful to a church thatdoesn’tmore or less reflect his own beliefs?Many of Zman’s followers arrived here by “shopping around” to find a political philosophy that seems right to them, instead of sticking with the system they were raised to accept. Is it wrong to do the same in choosing a church or spiritual organization?

                    You would think that person X holds belief Y because X believes Y to be true/reflect reality.  You state as much by “seems right to them.” Thus, in theory, unless you are a crass opportunist, you search for a religion, philosophy, or whatever that is true.  In other words, something that conforms to / reflects reality.  Of course, each of us has varying ability to perceive and understand reality.  Also, there are other factors constantly clouding our judgment of reality (social acceptance, that hot chick over there, etc.).  So, YMMV.

                    When anyone can look around until they find a church that matches their own personal set of beliefs and standards, instead of doing the hard work of matching your life to conform to traditions, customs and ethics that are passed down, then that religion is no different than any other feel-good new-age “spirituality”.

            Christianity’s problems go back further than American progressives of the 1960s and their deliberate subversion of the institution.  In a church council convened at Valladolid in 1550 to settle Spanish moral grounds for their colonies and, in particular, the legal status of the natives, Fray Bartolome de Las Casas (Spanish planter and Dominican friar) argued not only that the natives possessed every characteristic that Aristotle defined as the basis of the good life, but that their actions (including human sacrifice and cannibalism) were rational in their own cultural context.Yes, folks – cultural relativism’s birth, so far as I am aware.  Las Casas ultimately won the day with his claim “Thus all mankind is one” and there was no justification for for slavery since all men share the same rational nature.  Now I have no desire to be a slave or a slaveholder, but I do not recall this denunciation and prohibition of slavery in the Bible.  Jesus commanded all to be dutiful to their masters and all masters to be punctilious regarding their obligations to their underlings, servants, or slaves.  Yet talk to any Christian today and you will be told, as my friend claimed to me, that slavery is and was the most heinous of sins and Jesus was absolutely opposed to it.Again, for the simple minded:  I am not arguing FOR slavery, I am arguing AGAINST the entire moral framework that determines slavery  (particularly White of Negro rather than Negro of Negro or Indian of Indian or Mohammedan of White Christian) to be the ultimate moral evil.  Jettison that and the whole modern Judeo-Christian (a false portmanteau I use deliberately here) justification for everything goes out the window.

                “…talk to any Christian today and you will be told, as my friend claimed to me, that slavery is and was the most heinous of sins and Jesus was absolutely opposed to it.”Any Catholic who has studied his catechism would tell you that the worst sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  It is described as the “unforgivable” or “unpardonable” sin.  Per Pope John Paul II, “According to such an exegesis, ‘blasphemy’ does not properly consist in offending against the Holy Spirit in words; it consists rather in the refusal to accept the salvation which God offers to man through the Holy Spirit, working through the power of the Cross” (Dominum et Vivificantem, Encyclical Letter on the Holy Spirit, no. 46).https://catholicexchange.com/what-is-the-unforgivable-sin-against-the-holy-spiritProtestants also cite Matthew 12: 30-32 as referring to the unforgivable sin.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_sinAny Christian who has told you slavery is “the most heinous of sins” just doesn’t know their Christian stuff, not that the Church is in favor of slavery.https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/did-the-church-ever-support-slavery

            Antiochian Orthodox churches are largely Arab Christian and VERY right wing. It can be a little difficult for whitey to break in but in my experience once they know you’re serious it’s not an issue. You’ll probably find they’re one of the few orthodox churches who are quickly filling with converts.
It’s nice to see women with long hair wearing long dresses who actually act like women and have lots of kids.

        Anything worthy of being called a civilization has its deepest cultural and institutional roots in both a throne and an altar.  You cannot build a civilization without hierarchy and you cannot maintain the social cohesion to do so without the moral guidance of faith.  The expression of both these institutions is dependent upon group biology and that group’s interaction with nature and history.Reason built neither man nor his civilizations except as a way to explain what seemed to work and what didn’t work.  Reason used well is a way to explore and understand nature.  Modernism is an attempt to will nature into service to man’s failings: sin as virtue and virtue as sin. The rot of modernism has many different roots, some of them very old, some of it is innate to our nature. We have always been a work in progress.There is no way to reason nor rationalize our way out of moral and thus civilizational degeneracy.  There is no such thing as ‘peace’ the way moderns use it. War is man’s natural state: outright violence or war through other means in the use of politics.We are and have been in a race and cultural war using political institutions that no longer function as they were designed to work. Politics is not the path forward.  We need to think and organize the way our ancestors did when the Saracens were at the door.We have not only the right, but the moral duty to protect and defend our civilization by any means necessary.  That duty doesn’t need to be justified.If it’s anti-white in white lands it needs to be obliterated.

                Organize.If alone head to the local gun club**.  Listen to those around you.  They’ll find you.Organize: people don’t realize it – organization is organization and can take all forms.   A “club” to distribute food, gas and transport same during a “disaster”  remains an organization where men get together and plan, coordinate.  Also works our logistics and organizational skills and contacts- both of which are sorely lacking.Organization is organization&gt; and one so benevolent as disaster relief do not raise alarms.Strategic?  Build squads. 8-15 men.  Armies do not build squads: squads build armies.   A large mob is nothing.  A squad or two that is organized, knows each other and has a modicum of basic training and tactics is something indeed – and will defeat the mob no matter how armed every time.Its also all we can do.**getting the unarmed to arm is the most important thing we can do.  It is a huge leap and a positive act on their part with the moral and psychological impact on the prospect equivalent of swearing an oath.

                        That presumes one has a community.  It’s gotten to the point that I deliberately trash older or outgrown clothing or any unwanted items because any donation I make to any organization is going to go to Mexicans or Squatemalans.  Same reason I am not an organ donor.  If I cannot restrict my giving to White fellow citizens, I will not give.  For all those squishes here who will downvote this, I’m sure your high “moral principles” will be of great comfort to your children and grandchildren as hated minorities.  Meanwhile, mine know we’re in a war for survival and that I consider everything in that context.

Emergency training combined with the numerous prepper sites?  Fun, motivating, and available today.
Then, visit fraternal societies- Shriners, car clubs, etc.Get a feel for self-organized groups, see what’s useable.
I sense a Plan coming together.A stroke of genius indeed.

                Start with 1 or 2 or 3 good friends and as a group take it from there. Don’t go it alone. Also, be circumspect in how you grow. Don’t endanger your job or make yourself a target. When you have a good solid core reach out to other groups.

                Ostei,
It would be agreeable to find more preferable alternatives to obliteration. Whether they ARE available is up to debate. If/when the great reckoning erupts you won’t get to choose whether you are engaged in a war of succession or a war to the knife. The old axiom applies, “It takes only one party to start a war but two to end it.” We should harden our hearts to the possibility of limited possibilities.

                    Yes. Understood. But I continue clinging to the hope that the parties involved can reason themselves out of this mess without too much death and destruction. The world is big enough for all of us. But the various groups must understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with each group going its own way. There is no moral imperative for disparate groups being compelled to live cheek-by-jowl under the same political umbrella. Seems pretty mild and unobjectionable really, doesn’t it? But to utter the words I just did is to be an arch-villain according to the popular zeitgeist.

                        Ostei, I hear you. That is my wish as well. I just dont see the other side relenting. Where is there room to retreat to anymore? I dont think we get to make choices in the upcoming unpleasantness. I hope I am wrong. Truly. I dont think badly of you at all for your hopes. Honestly though, do you see any hope of those implacably opposed to you coming to a kumbaya moment of realizing you are just as entitled to your life and thoughts and letting you go your own way? Please show me anything in the news where the anti-white left is making an outreach or even retreating. Honestly,  I’d love a little white pill to soothe my growing anger. Until I see hope, I will continue to harden my heart.

            I always have to say something when I see somebody write something like this:” We are and have been in a race and cultural war using political institutions that no longer function as they were designed to work. Politics is not the path forward. We need to think and organize the way our ancestors did when the Saracens were at the door. ”It’s not that they ‘no longer work the way they were designed to work’ – that is a mis-representation of what happened.They were INTENTIONALLY SUBVERTED.The way you say it – it’s like the person who says the car crashed because the brakes stopped working. They’re portraying the accident like it was something that “just happened”There’s  a big difference between the brake lines rusting out – and somebody climbing under the car and intentionally cutting them.Garet Garrett addressed this behavior back in the 30’s when he called people who portrayed events in this manner as “innocent disarmers”.

            Yves, brilliant comment.  Too many, both here and elsewhere, feel the need to justify their heresy from political orthodoxy, either based on pseudo Christian teachings or civil American myth making.  I feel no need to justify my defense of my right to exist, nor for my preference for my own children and people over others.  That preference is good and natural, and while it does not necessarily imply antipathy for the other, it has turned to hard, cold rage on my part.  I therefore wholeheartedly endorse your choice of the term “obliterated.” Purported separate, peaceful coexistence is not my goal.

                    @OsteiPurported separate, peaceful coexistence is not my goal…I believe that shouldn’t be anyones goal because your goal should be much more than that and if the other side wants to offer that as a truce then we can settle for that as long as the separation includes an ocean between us and them…

                    Ostei – because I believe that’s operating on a faulty premise; i.e. even if separate states come to be, there will not be peaceful coexistence as a result.  The differing biological abilities and propensities of the races and nations would result in extreme inequality and envy, just as today.  The high trust nature of Europeans (and particularly European women) would result in calls for various special exceptions leading right back to where we are today.  And finally, because I believe the proportion of individuals in the world who are incapable of managing their own lives, let alone cities or nations, has far exceeded the carrying capacity of that far smaller fraction of the world that can and does manage and just wants to be left alone.  That will not happen, separate states or not.  It would mean eternal war and/or eternal agitating for immigration or gibs – both from within and without.

                        Thank you for explaining. However, I believe a significant and growing percentage of whites, looking at the debacle that is multiculti, would incorporate that knowledge in some future ethnostate and make it proof against the terrible mistakes that have led us to this pass. This state would be viable long term. Now would many non-whites be envious, and covetous? Of course. Let them. Let them fume and wail. But let them do it in their own lands. We went down the pathological altruism path once and it was suicidal. Never again.

            I agree Brother which is why I advocate for building Communities…You can’t build or organize without trust and the only way you can trust is to know people on a f2f basis…I’ve already weeded out a bunch of people that turned out to be worthless after getting to know them other than just online…So many people write one thing and live something totally different…The key to organizing is being around people that have the same goals and values that you hold so you can get together…If you guys don’t have that where you are at then move to somewhere that does and work out from there…

                F2F gets the upvote.  But separate Community is a stretch too far for most.  Even in the 1920s (forever, really) people moved all the time looking for work.  Today, they look for “good schools”.
So I think we’ll have to settle for what we can do in this mobile, distributed world.  F2F with the like-minded, like clubs, volunteer, etc.  Rub shoulders.
I’ve been wanting to ask you if you ever go check out or visit fraternal or community societies- Kiwanis, Elks, JC, Rotary, etc- and if you could observe and report back to us here.

                    I fantasize about living in a small hamlet with like-minded Righties, where we eliminate the public school altogether.  Instead of each family trying to undertake the whole burden of homeschooling their children, the job would be shared by various members of the village.  So at 10:00 the children would come to Mrs. Smith’s house for an English lesson, then afterwards, trot on over to Mr. Jones’s house for Math, and somewhere else for History.  Different people who have skills would be able to pass them down; there could be classes in agriculture and handiwork.  I’d be happy to teach French, and piano, and sewing.  The job would only be a few hours a week for any individual adult, instead of a full-time job for a teacher, and a full-day imprisonment for the students.  And of course, admission is entirely up to the teacher – no mandatory schooling, so no behavior problems would be tolerated.  A misbehaving child would be returned to its parents, for them to take the responsibility of teaching.  Maybe after the Great Collapse, something like this will arise.

        Once Christianity fell to the Prog death cult there was nothing to hold moral relativism, the cult of the Individual, and the rest of the fetishes and false idols like the Economy at bay; those things became “who we are.”The high priest BHO ordained this officially when he gave his “…cling to their guns and their bibles…” speech.A seemingly offhand remark but in this quip he openly revealed the disdain the left holds for the very foundation of our nation.Our history of taming a continent under fear of – and faith in God, has been erased from the official record.In its place? An earthbound and tenuous, paranoid, and petulant cult of emotional manipulation that is both fleeting and oppressive.Reward and punishment intermittently and often indiscriminately doled out by miserly minions of a bureaucracy of paranoia to keep the proles penitent to their betters.To this day, the “not who we are” invective at once invokes the full power of the church of progress to nullify any rational discourse while also laying bare the essential question and its official answer:Q. Then, who are we?A. We are nobody; we are everybody.See also, “the right side of history”.The left has had decades head start on rhetoric and framing (and destroying) the very language we share.Morality does not exist absent courage. If we ask our politicians to have more courage than we demonstrate in our own lives, we are bound to be disappointed.I often hear people on the right claim they have too much to lose by rocking the boat. I get it. But assuming the posture and tactics of dissidents is the path forward, is there not a point when individual courage need to rise up?Even if the path is toward self-segregation into dissident clans, at some point courage needs to eclipse compliance so we can figure out “who we are” once again.

                Pedantry here, The US is not and has never been a Democracy. It was conceived as a Republic with a limited franchise .However making the US into a direct  tyranny won’t be as easy as people think. It will require cooperation from the peopleThis is why we  have the sham elections we, direct rule would trigger even some on the mainstream Right to actually use those guns they’ve been hoardingHowever the grim irony is an Right Wing Populist dictatorship would be the best thing for the countries long term prospects . It won’t be possible to make one happen though , the Right hates responsibility and doesn’t have the force or skills to do itOdds are we will just go out like the USSR though some kind of short interregnum of authoritarian rule, probably by the left might happen first.

                    A.B., does the Right need to make an authoritarian dictatorship for us to get one?  Seems to me, that the Castro/Mao model of authoritarian dictatorship through revolution and organizing groups within the population taking up arms and fighting from the hills is not the more common one.  There is rather the (seems to me) more common model of the military assuming control when the situation of civilian rule turns to chaos.  Argentina/Chile comes to mind.  Unfortunately, I’m not convinced that the current military leadership is as conservative/rightest in their thinking as they once were.

                        The US military cannot take control over the US. The US is so vast that occupying Texas alone against resistance would be too difficult.I mean right now we have to have  snipers guarding freaks and that is without any real probability of resistance . Once trouble actually happens? Ugh.Bullying a few states as Eisenhower did in Alabama is one thing and of course  cooperate States could be bolstered with Federal troops but a real rebellion, collapse or insurgency is an end gameThe Soviet Union despite being far better set for oppression was unable to rebuild itself after collapse too.No  developed regime can use nukes or mass casualty weapons in modernity either . This would turn every other developed nation against them , create a mass rebellion and destroy the economy.Fundamentally of the US fails, it ends . The only question is what nations, plural come after and how long the chaos period is.And no, there are not enough hard core conservatives with group think to take back all of CONUS against any Leftists resistanceThe Right is too divided . Even if there is stability a lot of groups will not cooperate with one another after the fall and a lot of people out there who have gained power, wealth and land through ruthless initiative are not going to be interested in going back to 1980This is why even though its seems fruitless i and many of us struggle to trigger some kind of lawful non violent fix. The consequences of TEOTAWKI are not pleasant to consider even for the winners

                                bile, you really think the US Is the USSR?No its not.  Not the same economy and the later USSR had a saner meta culture in some waysAlso USG had vast files on many people , no doubt I have an FBI file too, people speaking out aren’t vanishing or being bothered.The US isn’t in rebellion because there is a dim chance of avoiding one and more importantly there is no will to power on the RightThe Right hates power and as such can’t rebel since to rebel is to take power for your own ends . No will, no power.I’m not even sure the Right has any ends  other than complaining .I mean our host article today is in a situation where he has to explain to people in his audienceIf it requires government regulation to have prices on goods and services that indicate the real value of the items, that’s not a terrible trade-off.This is common fucking sense and has been known since Hammurabi, maybe earlierHuge chunks of our movement are so terrified or ruling and of responsibility and they might “turn bad” or something they can’t even think about power and want to get rid of power somehowAnyone with  an IQ above about 90 knows power fill a vacuum and if your boots aren’t on necks, someone else’s will beOn those grounds I admire Google , they get this and have will to power.THis  is not government doing  either . The Right created its own crimestop and wrongthink problem back during the Cold War be thinking that power used for good ends turns you into a CommunistBullshitIf the Right realizes that if they want a good place to have families they will have to do a lot of things to make it happen , most of them taking away personal freedomThat situation, less of certain types of freedoms in order to get married, raise kids have continuity of culture and a future is a worth trade offIf the Right gets this,  puts an end to the Libertarians and Grifters and realizes that hey are fighting so future generations can have this,  they have a chance.Till them, my money is on the clowns .

            Politics is Theater! Last evening Tucker had a piece on the 8 million strong website Ravelry for knitters going all POZd and screeching Trump is a racist. Yours truly has a login to Ravelry because I knit and get patterns from their website. Ravelry is also for women infected with the deep herd instinct to band together in large website groups and natter about empy-headed terminal chick hobbies and herd bond. I must be minus half an “X” chromosome as I only get a pattern and get off the website. Not  big on herding.Ravelry has gone full on John Brown hair on fire abolitionist Puritan screeching Lefty as you can see by their new policy:“New Policy Effectively Immediately: We are banning support of Donald Trump and his administration on Ravelry.  We cannot provide a space that is inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy.  Support of the Trump administration is unambiguously support for white supremacy. Happy Pride Month!”This is what I posted on Ravelry in response:“Done with You Intolerant HypocritesAh….a totalitarian edict from the Lefty religion of peace, tolerance and inclusion. I just wished to knit and you crazy people turned this website into an intolerant virtue signaling political website. You just blew fire in my face and told me to screw off. Same to you, Babes! Good luck with your Marxism and free stuff. Civil war is coming. Done with you and will spread the word of you becoming Lefty zealots.”And I just wanted to knit and be left alone. They are demanding I Sieg Heil to the Left before I lift my knitting needles. The cold civil war between the Cloud People and the Dirt people grows as they go at us with hammer and tongs. For a lack of eloquence…..Screw Them.

                A lot of the old car sites simply ban politics all together.  That actually makes sense, as the hobby can be a sanctuary from all the crazy.  But to take sides and name call is simply stupid.  Looking forward to the “get woke, go broke” to find Revelry.

                    That’s funny , because I’ve never gotten a leftie vibe off any of the automotive,  truck , tractor,  or motorcycle sites I have visited.  Visit the off topic section and read between the lines on comments people make and it’s pretty easy to get the temperature of which way most forum members lean.  And it’s usually right or in the middle at worst.Becoming a car nut when I was a kid is definitely one of the things that steered me in the direction of right wing politics.  It was pretty easy to figure out who it was that was against my interests – and the constant influx of new regulations and taxes and “no you can’t do that”  impositions on vehicle modification and purchasing options – all comes squarely out of left wing affiliated interest groups.One of the most egregiously stupid efforts I remember was the push to put airbags on motorcycles sometime back in the 90’s.  It was led (of course) – by yet another group of women mad about something.Luckily the whole thing beaten down with prejudice by the motorcycle industry and riders groups who all recognized a direct threat to not only their economic interests , but also to motorcycles themselves.  The technical stupidity of the whole thing also played right into the strengths of a group of people who as a group are more technically adept than the vast majority of the population.Little things like that work wonders towards affecting people’s political viewpoints though.  I’m pretty sure the mothers mad against motorcycles turned a lot of minds rightward with that little stunt.

                    In November 2016 just after Trump got elected, Penzy spice and seasonings out of Minnesota sent all of us with a login an email stating if we voted for Trump, we could F*** ourselves in the middle of the freeway, go away and never darken their doorstep again. I was shocked, shocked I tell you (Claude Rains), stopped buying their wonderful products and took my name off their subscription list.The common denominator between Penzys and Ravelry is Lefty “abolitionist” hysterical women. You don’t have Lefty hysterical religion of tolerance women on car websites. Of course you’ve never seen this behavior.The old quiet rule, which is now blown up, in women groups is NO politics. Women used to enjoy just henning up in good company and being kind and supportive. Used to enjoy circuit training exercise in a big circle of women because if I needed to know any damned thing literally…a restaurant, a new doctor, a new rug, health problem info, etc….someone jiggling around in that women circle would know the information I needed. I was behind the barn door when shopping genetics where handed out (Basic Husband was first in line) so I kept the skids greased by exercising and gathering “what-where-and how” information from the gals.Now that is all gone. Lefty blow torch politics are everywhere. I’m worried that this anti-woman growing anger will, unfortunately and understandably, lead to active blowback. We have collectively brought it on ourselves. These women are space aliens to me.  I seek dispensation!Now my world is becoming Robert Putnam “Bowling Alone.”

                        At the risk of being accused of petting the unicorn, I will say the following.Ethnic nationalism should direct the anti-woman anger to the feminists who deserve it.  If we want our country to survive past a generation, we need white women just as much as they need us.  Both white men and white women have problems.  Now just like with the cycle of abuse, we can either choose to perpetuate those problems or we can fix them, even if those problems were not our fault.We have daughters, nieces, sisters, and female cousins too.  I have a younger sister and I am actively trying to stop her from following in the footsteps of her older feminist relatives.  I cannot do that by being a woman-hater.  At the same time, I cannot convince her to respect my advice by being a weak cuck.  Going to either of those extremes will just ensure her choices of men will be similar.

                        I also noticed the growing misogyny in the the Dissident Right, including this blog.  If women are too associated with the Left, we may be reduced to the level of second-class citizens in a non-Lefty America – not the1950s-style America that I would be happy with, but losing the right to vote, even outright White Sharia.

                            Okay, unicorn petting time is over.  In any future Dissident Right state, universal suffrage is not going to exist.  Most men and the vast majority of women have no business voting.Voting rights should be held by stakeholders who are net-taxpayers, not convicted felons, not 1st generation immigrants, and not the children of 1st generation immigrants.  No dual citizens or owners of foreign property either.The aforementioned stakeholders would consist of the following.1.  Honorably discharged combat veterans.2.  Owners of domestic property valued above a certain amount to be determined later.3.  Married, heterosexual couples with 3 or more biological children who have not been adjudicated as delinquent.Since combat positions would be reserved to men, and in the modern welfare state, most women are not net-taxpayers, most women will only have 1 feasible path for earning the right to vote.

                                Jeez….am going to tear up my chick card with this opinion.  It’s really nice to be an older gal. Have commented before that after 50, our estrogen and hormones calm down, for some of us, and can chug along in a rather steady manner, with an occasional bout of turbulence on the starboard side.  Think I remember from Lakota friends that either their tribe and/or other plains tribes in the wayback time allowed women into tribal positions of power after they stopped their moontime/ramped past menopause. Could be a horsecrap myth. Yet an idea to think about. There really are some wise stable women out there.  You just can’t see them. They don’t kick up dust.Older people are also worthwhile. You can sort out the wastrels, drunks and degenerates…and there’s a lot of them. There really are older folks who have learned a lot, have tempered their thought, language and excesses. Many Boomer folks don’t qualify for the temper their nature or excesses stuff.  Older folks may purposely make an effort to continue to grow up all the way until dust,  identifying and working with their flaws, and gathering wisdom….the ability to learn from mistakes, to say ooops I goofed, to change what doesn’t work, create new efficient patterns, develop qualities of observation and introspection to identify wisdom. And give away that wisdom when asked. So include a few older folks that use power to aid and teach their people in the new world.

                                Last Stand, agree with the concept of earned suffrage, but the qualifications need to be thought out in more detail.  Combat veterans?  What’s that mean if there is no war?  Heck, I remember guys getting flights that simply skimmed Vietnam air space to collect combat pay. They were no more combat vet’s than I.

                                    Admittedly we do need to tighten up definitions.  Bottom line is, if you are not in combat arms, getting shot at and returning fire, you would not qualify.  If there is no war, that just means we have fewer voters, not the worst thing in the world.

                                If you’re imagining the future Dissident Right state as just being a different version of a warfare-welfare state – what you’re imagining is going to be a failure.Any state for white men must eschew welfare.  There is no long term survival scenario that involves mass welfare administered BY THE STATE – that is a recipe for success.Free shit attracts freeloaders and encourages sloth.  Once a critical mass is reached – that free shit becomes an army with their own political representation – and then it’s absolutely impossible to get rid of the welfare addled underclass until the entire edifice collapses.  Worse yet – the free shit attracts flies (POC) – and the politicians see this is a way to gain more power – so the cycle accelerates into implosion.This is why I think the “dissident right” is basically a failbus with a good vocabulary.  It seems the vast majority of them absolutely refuse to learn from what has JUST happened – and are just a bunch of only slightly fallen away leftists who simply cannot give up their marxist influenced view of paradise on earth.

                                    Looking at voting patterns the only people a  laissez faire system appeals to are Randroids and other lolberts.
Just about everyone else prefers a managed enconomy and some welfare.  I would rather have a lower standard of living, pay higher prices, and higher taxes to take care of my people.  Nothing should be free but laissez faire is not the only solution.

                        Just my perspective as a man – but from what I’ve been seeing over maybe the last 3-4 years is that there is most definitely growing anger, and also just a lot of “I’m really sick to death of this shit” on the male side of the aisle in regards to the hysterics of women in general.You can see it on Youtube with the profusion of MGTOW commenters and channels. You could see it on Heartiste’s site – especially in the comment section.  Being a guy who has put out the ” women should lose the vote ” idea many years ago – I definitely notice a lot more men jumping on that bandwagon as of late.You are correct :  ” We have collectively brought it on ourselves”.But I see the problem as worse than that.  When the identity politics game seriously started getting played – what happened is it separated the ability of whites to criticize the bad behavior of blacks – and it also separated the ability of men from being able to criticize the shit behavior of women.  With women it’s one step worse – because as men we’ve been told that women are to be worshipped, don’t fart, respect your mother , etc…. .   So it’s a major red pill suppository when you can get a man to actively divorce himself from women.In my opinion when you can get a man to shut down his natural inclination to subject himself to women – because he finally realizes that the price is just too high with the “modern” version – you’ve just broken a mental trap.  You just opened a door and all sorts of other bad thoughts now become acceptable.One of the things that I’ve seen pointed out by the MGTOW crowd a number of times – is that women will get upset not only when you’re giving them attention they don’t want – but they’ll also get upset when you’re not giving them attention they do want.  To the average guy – this approaches lunacy.  The MGTOW guys use the term “going monk” – in that they just say “phuck this” – and actively work to build a life separated from women.  Some of the stuff they go into – like artificial wombs and building a male centered society – is built around their perception that women are just so damn crazy that there’s no fixing the issue.   The only way out is a sane society built by men – and if they have to resort to artificial wombs to birth the next generation – then that is the way it’s going to have to be.And that is why I think that MGTOW and guys like Heartiste are actually a better route to defeat globohomo for white men.  It gives them explanations for things white males (young ones in particular) see happening to them in the right here and right now.  The explanations might not necessarily be sane or practical – but it’s apparent that the left is pushing white males away (black males too to some extent)  – with a vengeance.So in that respect the lunacy of women who have sworn fealty to the left – are sowing the seeds of their own destruction.  They’re driving away the (white) men – and therefore driving away the one thing that would have supported the leftist globohome enterprise.  POC and females are not going  to keep that house of cards from falling down.

                            Not sure this artificial womb thing addresses the real problem. Have an infant in the house — first one. Demands 100% of some human’s attention, 24/7. And experience now demonstrating that a woman’s (mother’s) unceasing, obsessive and controlling attention to that infant is a necessary component of human reproduction and survival. I’m an older guy and have seen alot …. we males just don’t have the operating system demanded by this one task. And it’s that very female capacity, in beings shorn of this primary role, that makes them so problematic in modern society.

                                Most modern women fail at that task too. There was a reason that women worked together to raise children. Extended families mattered a lot. Not many women are capable of handling kids “on their own”.

                Well, his “base” seems to be showing up in droves whenever he appears in public forum.  If certain folk don’t show up to vote in 2020, they’ll not be from his base, but rather of those who were disillusioned enough to take a chance in 2016 to vote for a dark horse, non-politician.  If Trump can make the case as Reagan did with a “are you better off than four years ago”, “morning in America” in his campaign for re-election he has a chance, especially if the Dem’s field a radical anti-White ideologue—which seems to be just about all they have running for the nomination.If one suggests that the anti-Trumper’s on the dissident Right as post here sometimes will make a difference, I doubt it.  I’ve been described as right of Attila the Hun by any number of folk, but if I vote in 2020 the Presidential race, I’d likely cast for Trump.  I said *if*.

        Anti-racism is the new religion. The Williamson piece is one of many examples lately about historical figures discovered to be racist. We’ve already seen confederate statues toppled and schools renamed and chatter about Harriet Tubman replacing that racist Andrew Jackson on the 20 dollar bill. Minneapolis even renamed Lake Calhoun to an unpronounceable American Indian name. Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams has called for the removal of confederates from Stone Mountain. Someday, sooner than we think, they’re going to take dynamite to Mt. Rushmore.

                            The first step is for white men to raise the uncomfortable fact of this phenomenon with white women. The initial response from most of those women will be, “But that’s racist!” There’s a war on noticing, if you hadn’t noticed…

                                Dual pronged solution to that problem.  First stop white-knighting for women who do not deserve it.  Second, remember being woke is fun until it affects you personally.  Whenever a white woman accuses a non-white man of rape, start talking about the KKk, lynch mobs, and vicious​ stereotyping of colored men in front of liberal white women​.  Make them eat their own words

                                    Excellent idea.  Throw their “ideals” into their faces.
I once remarked to a Jewish friend that one of the reasons why Jews are liberals is because Jews tend to be affluent, so they can escape the consequences of their purposed idealism.  She agreed with me.  Easy to care about the poor and oppressed when they live far away.
I have zero sympathy for Social Justice Warriorettes and wish they suffer at the hands of their pets the same fate as German women at the end of WWII.

                                You must think NWL are real dimwits who have never read  a newspaper, watched television, surfed the web, seen crime stats or otherwise managed to have any exposure to current events.  Maybe things are different now, but back in the day women had a sense of danger and risk honed to a state of near paranoia and a healthy scepticism of not just black men, but men in general.  The mad rapist was the bogeyman of traveling at night or locking up the place for bedtime.  Situational awareness was second nature.  So don’t imagine that NWL are so naive as to need a personal experience to understand risk.  The young ladies I know are not quite so obtuse as you make them out to be.  I hate to say this, but  I’m starting to wonder if you even know any.

                    They’ll get around to MLK.  He was hetero and non trans-aware, for two things.  But those are all excuses.  The tearing down of all things is about the act of tearing them down, not what they represent.  They aren’t putting up any statues or monuments to anything.  This all is simply a series of tantrums, like children destroying their rooms when they get put in time out.

                Whites are condemned for owning slaves yet were the first to outlaw it.  Slavery was legal in Saudi Arabia until 1962.  The slave trade was outlawed in Libya in 1853, but persisted until Moammar Ghaddafi’s time and has reappeared with the overthrow of his government.
No good deed goes unpunished..

                    Again, the condemnation and tearing down is not because of the reasons, the reasons are rationalizations, to the rest of us, for why they are entitled, and expect affirmation, for the condemnation and tearing down.  The acts stand alone as simple childish acting out.  They can’t defend that, so they go into the progressive toolbox to come up with “muh reasons”.  Once you see it for what it is, it is impossible to ignore.  Much of the gay and especially the trans thing is the same crap going on.  Dressing up as a form of childish acting out.  That’s why the 10 year old trans dressing thing is such a big deal.  It personifies and fleshes out their own childish game.Biden is the only old-school, horse trading politician on the Dem side.  The rest of them are simply rabble rousers, encouraging the condemnation and tearing down, by mouthing the reasons and fanning the flames.  The others know the game and are after capturing the financial and political power “skim” for themselves, personally, by leading the parade.  Bernie and Lieawatha are particularly adept at the tactic. There is a big distinction between Biden and the others.

        “In America, the Right used to rely on Christianity, tradition and America’s frontier culture, but those were abandoned as the Left anathematized each one in turn. ”We need to make a distinction. The Right IMO are white conservatives in general. Not a bunch of snobby Buckley types who only existed in East coast enclaves.The Right’s pillars had been under constant attack by not only the Left but by big business all through the late 60’s  and past Reagan. I’d wager and say the business community did the most damage. They got rid of the Blue laws in small towns, were the biggest pushers of putting women in the workforce(thus damaging families), flat lining wages so single income family earners became rarer and rarer. With LBO’s and a few years later, off-shoring decimating one small town after another in the heartland. And this has been going on for 40+ years now.  This has resulted in shattered families, wrecked communities with no hope of getting better, etc.  These people used to represent the Right’s core socially if not politically.Today businesses keep telling white women that going to college, getting into massive debt and working in a Herman Miller cube farm is more meaningful than having and raising a family.  This has taken a lot of women out of the breeding pool and created millions of miserable females.The Right’s biggest mistake was aligning with the oligarchic GOP who at best considered them something to be used and disposed of

        The conflation of logical/scientific-level-objective “rightness” with morality was the most apparent flaw I found with Objectivism and its libertarian fellow-travelling ideologies.  Ms. Rosenbaum always resorted to (((witchery))) when trying to address the issue of “errors of knowledge vs. errors of morality.”  Williamson, Ben Shapiro and most of the Neo-Con Clown Car have adopted a cheap knock-off version of Rand’s myopic conflation of objective facts with context-based value judgments and mere subjective preferences.  The inability to cope with ambiguity and uncertainty is a common flaw of the immature, adolescent mindset shared by rabid partisans of the Science! Left and Libertarian Right.The thing that makes Z stand out among dissident pundits is his grasp of the religious and moralistic aspects of the Enlightenment and all its poison fruits, Right and Left. I’m hoping he turns this into a book gig or ten.  It’s a perspective that has only been touched on by other pundits (e.g. McWhorter’s “Our Flawed New Religion.”)Z, please strive to become the Kevin MacDonald of “The Neo-Puritan Question.”  You’ve tapped a rich vein no one else seems to be working.

            In my 20’s (Ronaldus was pres.) my bro-in-law introduced me to Ayn Rand. I knew the world was effed up and had rejected original sin (I didn’t understand it) and I was lost. Rand saved me.I eventually grew out of it about 20 years ago, (as a religion, anyway), and in the past 2 years it seems I am starting over. I’m not that smart, so I have to chew on something until I can make a declarative sentence containing the whole thought, or as much as possible.What I have so far is that our moral superiors rape boys and girls, kill babies, destroy initiative with welfare, destroy entire cultures, break their arms patting themselves on the back, and gleefully rub our noses in all of it.The enlightenment brought us Rationalism-as-morality, which killed God, and replaced morality of survival with morality of altruism.I define Rationalism as: Dropping context until one’s bullshidt doesn’t stink.Altruism was weaponized by the Germans into both Communism and it’s obverse face of the coin, Fascism. The primary product of both was industrialized murder.Altruism was running rampant in the US after 1850 through the churches but became weaponized here with the admix of determinism in the 1960’s.The formula is this: Altruism is that the strong are morally obligated to protect the weak. Determinism is that one cannot help being what we are.Therefore, you are stronger than me, so you OWE me. And if you won’t give me what I want, I have the Moral RIGHT to steal it from you.I’m no expert, but it seems like morality is biological rather than rational. That every creature with a brain has an intrinsic morality that makes it survive to the best of that creature’s ability. This morality of survival got us through several million years. With the invention of the printing press we have enshrined rationality as the highest good.Yet the physicists can’t tell us how a 3 year old balances a bicycle. The limitations of rationality are so severe that basic, simple functions are beyond it’s wheelhouse. It’s useful, but not very.Imitation, and then story, are the ways best suited to our brains, which are designed to DO what comes NEXT. From what I understand, all of the real religions (not ones written by expedient 7th century warlords) are about telling stories through metaphor that show us how to survive.An example is the story of Cain. I learned last year that it’s an explanation of how half-assed work produces no reward, and then resenting that failure as someone else’s fault hammers the last nail. Obvious, I guess, but it brought it home to my own failings, giving me the chance to fix my direction. Morality of survival.Summary: We don’t need a new morality, as the one that got us here is pretty damn good. Maybe we need to keep improving it, but maybe we don’t. 50,000 years of minds working on it, I doubt we can do much better.What we need to do is viciously, ruthlessly destroy the ones who think they are smart enough to invent a new morality on the fly, because all that they do is evil.No one is smart enough to improve a thousand generations of knowledge other than in the smallest increments. We should try, but understanding what’s already been learned is a far more daunting task than patting ourselves on the back for being clever.

                I used to be a Randroid too.  What snapped me out of it was a trio of realizations.
1.  The only “natural right-libertarians” are white men with an IQ above average.
2.  The big corporations that started off as small free market companies now have merged with government.  Also, the idea of transnational entities with profit as their only goal is poisonous to the health of a nation.
3.  They think that if the economy is right, they will have paradise here.  This is the same premise as Marxism except it is held by antisocial individualists instead of mediocre collectivists.

        You can see the panic of the Conservative Inc. gatekeepers in the tweets of people like French. He is deathly afraid of having to get a real job someday. I assume that is some of the drive behind the National Conservatism conference, they see the rising tide of nationalism and are trying to get in front of it and stake out the acceptable positions. This far and no farther. They are terrified of Jared Taylor and Peter Brimelow being in attendance and saying something naughty so they ban them.

        In my view, the downfall of the Buckley conservatives was the adoption of the neo-liberal/libertarian emphasis on individual freedom. The right libertarians of the Fusionist coalition were focused on political and economic freedom, e.g., deregulation and limited government. They either assumed that a traditional cultural and moral framework was a given, or they didn’t care.The left libertarians, on the other hand, didn’t give a damn about political and economic freedom. In fact they were fine leaving that battlefield to the progressives. What the left libertarians wanted was to replace the social and cultural norms of the society with their hedonism and perversion. This cultural battle was left to the social conservatives, and they were overrun completely.The right libertarians are losing a bit slower, mostly due to the power of money from the likes of the Koch brothers, but their defeat is on the horizon. The only “winners” from the Fusionists were the anti-communists, and after their victory in the Cold War they became a weird millennialist cult that worships the global neo-liberal order (“democracy for all!”) and Israel.The oddest outcome of all of this, to me anyway, is the emergence of the Christian Zionist movement among social conservatives. it can only be the result of some combination of gaslighting and mass hysteria.

There are some on the Old/Hard/Real Left who make this same argument regarding what happened to their team, too.  That is not say there is common ground here, but it is something to think about.

            Excellent comment.What you’re detailing is what I’ve pointed out here before in response to the incessant whining about “libertarians”.   To me being a libertarian was more about the political and economic freedom you highlighted.  As you said:  culture and morals were to be outside the realm of politics and government and that was a given.I honestly never took much notice of the leftie libertarians until maybe 10 years ago – when more and more I’d see their strident whining on many forums I frequent.  Seemed to coincide with Obama coming on the scene.  Taking their comments at face value – I came to the conclusion that they were not “libertarians” – but just another bunch of leftists who wanted more access to drugs and sex.As you pointed out…………..The battle against all the hedonism and perversion pushed by the left in general has been completely lost by the social conservatives.  I blame them – because if you can’t hold up your own standards then well you can’t expect other people to take you seriously.  The examples of this over my lifetime are so numerous it’s hard to recount them all.  The Catholic Church pedo scandals though are a good case in point.If the right libertarians are losing – it’s because their economic arguments are not catching on,  and I blame that squarely on things like the Fed and the government’s ability to just continuously money pump to support their commie utopian schemes.I do believe that it will all implode one day.  Unfortunately they’ve been able to keep it going for so long that the sensible arguments against doing it will likely long since been buried and forgotten – and what will come next will just be another round of a slightly different form of lunacy.

                I don’t think it’s fair to blame the social conservatives for losing the battle against the left.  They were systematically thrown under the bus by the “fiscally conservative, socially liberal” wing of Conservatism, Inc. for years.  Every election cycle was filled with seething resentment of those damned irrational social conservatives gumming the game for the oh-so-clear-eyed rationalists at the top, who could easily win if we didn’t always scare off the voters with Tourettes-like eruptions about abortion.  We were supposed to fade away, like religion and God, and the impatience of the ledger-worshippers at our impudence in persisting was almost tangible.  Why couldn’t we realize that our petty little obsessions were standing in the way of Balancing The Budget?

            I think the fundamentalist Christian movement for Israel can partially be ascribed to not being able to argue for anything other than Israel, anti-abortion, and anti-racism.  They lost everywhere else.  Conservatives, mainly neocons, were willing to throw them under the bus every at opportunity.

                The governor who signed the strict anti-abortion bill in Alabama was a childless twice-divorced woman.  Would a twice-divorced man be elected governor of Alabam 50 years ago?  They obsess over Israel and abortion because they lost every other battle, most recently gay marriage.  It’s their line in the sand.

            It is also–quite simply–the result of false teaching in their churches. False teaching that was manufactured in the 19th century in the hope of producing exactly the fruit it is producing today. Chuck Baldwin has come out of that now, and has several very good lessons on “Christian” Zionism. You can find them on You Tube.

                Thanks, MRV! He’s great, even calling out that snake, Ben Shapiro.Interviewer: You said that there is some kind of “blasphemy of Jewish Zionist…the foundation of the faith and fellowship of Christian Zionists is NOT Jesus Christ, but Israel.” What did you mean by that?Chuck Baldwin: The vast majority of evangelical Christians in America subscribe to a fallacious Israel-based eschatology. As a result, evangelicals labor under the delusion that the modern State of Israel born in 1948 is a fulfillment of Bible prophecy and the Abrahamic Covenant. This means that evangelicals believe that by “blessing” Zionist Israel, they are incurring the favor and blessing of God. Therefore, evangelicals feel morally and scripturally obligated to assist the Zionist state no matter what.This false theology was a concoction of Zionist scholars going back to the mid-nineteenth century. The writing of the Scofield Reference Bible in the early twentieth century popularized the myth of a resurrected nation of Israel fulfilling Biblical prophecy and prepared the hearts and minds of evangelicals for the “miracle” of Israel’s “rebirth” in 1948. By the time Rothschild’s Israel launched its Six Day War in 1967, a majority of evangelicals had become Christian Zionists. Since 1967, Christian Zionism has grown to become the single most powerful political force in the United States.Having been educated in dispensational futurism myself (and teaching it for over 30 years), I have a firm grasp on the way Christian Zionists relate to Scripture. In their minds, the State of Israel is essential to their entire faith system. To them, there is no faith system without Israel. That’s why, when someone such as myself challenges the scriptural legitimacy of the Zionist State of Israel, evangelicals take it as an assault against the Christian faith itself. In the minds of most Christian Zionists, acceptance of the legitimacy of modern Israel is tantamount to the acceptance of Jesus Christ and the Christian faith. In their way of thinking, they are inseparable.For example, Christians Zionists absolutely love the Christ-rejecting Zionist blasphemer Ben Shapiro. Yet, many of these same Christians despise yours truly. Think about it: I am a devout disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. I believe in His deity, His virgin birth, His sacrificial death on the Cross, His literal resurrection from the dead and His literal return to earth.Shapiro openly denies all of these things and equates our Lord to a common criminal who got what he deserved when he was crucified. Yet, Christian Zionists love Shapiro and despise me. That shows you how the basis for fellowship among so many Christian Zionists is not Jesus Christ, but the State of Israel.https://www.veteranstoday.com/2019/05/25/chuck-baldwin-destroys-christian-zionism-and-perpetual-wars/

        Actual conservatism will make a comeback in the West if and only if White folks learn one simple, two-letter word: “So?”  As in, when some blue-haired nose-ringer with more armpit hair than IQ points starts shouting about how ur a rayciss, the one and only appropriate response is “So?”  Throw in an “And?” for extra effect.  (If you feel your interlocutor might be reachable, follow it up with “I’ll stop being a racist the minute y’all do.  Racism against White people is still racism”).  Then shrug and walk away.

                C.S. Lewis said:“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated;but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”  If life in a Democracy is one long tent revival meeting with a struggle between competing moral view points, then be very careful which doctrines you choose to follow.

            Severian,
May I make a small suggestion to your otherwise excellent idea. In the age of cell phone video and professional/employment ruination an “admission” of being a racist may not be wise.
Perhaps a dismissive “So you say” may have the enraging effect you are looking for without the possible consequences of a “So… And?”

        The pseudo-religion of “anti-bigotry” allows individuals who are otherwise loathsome to feel good about themselves at no personal cost, no personal sacrifice. I noticed even as a kid that the people loudest in their support of the supposed poor and oppressed were the most reprehensible individuals who didn’t care about people as individuals.  The people loudest in their willingness to redistribute wealth were the cheapest when it came to their own money.  Moral peacocks the lot of them.

        Z: “This is all code for morality.”  Yep.  Much of what we say comes down to morality.  Having grown up in a highly judgemental home with a religious fanatic mom, I tuned into the morality of talk from an early age.  A lifetime’s amusement has been hearing all the euphemisms (“code”) people use for the words “immoral” or “that’s wrong”.I wasn’t around in the 50s or 60s but I figure calling something “immoral” died off in those years.  Definitely by the 70’s, the most uncool thing you could do was say something was immoral.  You may as well don a church lady wig.  Or worse a Jerry Falwell mask.The meme of “Don’t Judge” and “What is “NORMAL”/ “There is NO NORMAL!” was surging hot ‘n heavy from ’70 to 2000.  Then the Left got real control and you don’t hear “don’t judge!” anymore.  Cuz they love judging the f*** out of us.Anyway, back to code.  Off the top of my head here are some of the  Post-Morality morality code phrases.  I.e. ways people since mid-century have tried to avoid sounding like a pastor while constantly making pastor judgments.“That’s SO not cool.”  “That ain’t right, (chuckle-chuckle).  “Soooo creeepy”.  “Not to judge, but…”.  “OK, that’s just weird.” “Not my cuppa tea.”  “I’m an anything goes kinda guy, but that’s just…(sentence always trails off, leaving moral judgment implied.)In the mid 90’s you could dispense with the euphemism and straight out declare, “OK that’s just WRONG”.  But you’d have to be a girl and say it with ironic emphasis.   “Not OK” has been big for a while.I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve heard a line of conversation end with, “that’s just.”  (As both parties slowly shake head).  Morality police badge successfully avoided.  Cuz wouldn’t THAT be embarrassing.“Immoral” won’t come back because it will give away that the Left is the new church lady we all used to avoid.  So the respectable Left says “Our code of conduct disallows…”  As if this Code of Conduct fell from the sky and they themselves would of course have NOTHING to do with dictating morality.

            Many people nowadays mock our ancestors for their so-called “Victorian prudery” or our parents for their so-called “1950s repression.”  Please.  Today, we are as prudish, repressed, moralistic and judgmental as our ancestors in the 1850s or our parents in 1950s were; we’re just prudish, repressed, moralistic and judgmental about different things.  “Bigotry” and a lack of “diversity” and “inclusion” are the “sins” of today.  Even cucks play the game.  “Democrats are the real racists,” blah, blah, blah.  Look at the pile-on Joe Biden on Breitbart.com.

            In my 20’s (Ronaldus was pres.) my bro-in-law introduced me to Ayn Rand. I knew the world was effed up and had rejected original sin (I didn’t understand it) and I was lost.

        Zman, on the same principle as “always strike a Libertarian, he’ll know why,” I’ll never tire of your beatdowns of the NRO crowd. On the other hand, they’re already moribund, and barely merit attention.Your most provocative idea, IMO, is this question of “moralities”: the need to recognize and abandon the one that restrains our side, in favor of a different morality that liberates, fortifies, nourishes and vindicates us. I would welcome more from you on what exactly the latter would involve. I’m not interested in a “manifesto,” but more like a posing of questions and considerations that could guide us together in settling a new “moral homeland”—like Aeneas finding his way to Rome.Obviously I don’t mean to suggest that this is solely your burden. And I do see you approaching this matter around the edges, via your interest in the examples of the Classical world, and in some of your economic writing. The beatdown stuff is fun, no question, and negative examples have their place in a discussion. But if being David French is what we’re fleeing from, what should we be moving towards?

            I agree; I could read these essays on the collapse of NRO and Conservatism, Inc every day.  It’s like the Jews with their story of Passover:  Let’s tell again the story of how we were delivered from slavery!  It’s like that for me: I was duped for years and years, I gave the best years of my life to this phony-baloney “movement” that, as Mark Steyn said, never seemed able to “move” anywhere.

        What we refer to as Conservative Inc. or lolbertarianism was forged as a response to the old material Leninism that was the major threat probably up until the 1980s. In response to the vision of starving horror posed by collective farming, the right constructed an intellectual case for free markets, low taxes and private enterprise that reached its triumphal apogee in the Reagan/Thatcher years.In fairness, it was a reasonable response to the threat as it was configured from 1930s-1980s (or thereabouts). But the left proved again that they are more intellectually adaptable by ditching material Leninism in favour of biological Leninism. The right (for want of a better term) had no response, except to keep beating the same old drums which no longer resonate with anyone.In short, what we call “the right” is still fighting the last war which is why they appear so laughable and ridiculous. They are a cold-war relic; like a organic, walking version of a Trabant. Tooling up for this new war would require them to jettison all the principles that they hold dear and they just can’t bring themselves to do it. So, there they are, stuck in their ideological cul-de-sacs with no way to escape.I think this explains, at least in part, the infatuation with economics which is actually merely a sub-set of the social sciences no more worthy of attention than, say, architecture or linguistics. It’s not the cake or even the icing on the cake, it is the sprinkles on the icing on the cake. Yet by obsessing about economics they can safely frolic around waving spreadsheets and sperg-out over price indices without any risk of being called waycist or a transphobe. Or something. It’s a safe haven, a cocoon.So, yes they are gangrenous and dying but I submit that we must administer a coup de grace. If they were merely useless then I would be happy to leave them wallowing in their mental prisons but they are actively aiding the enemy now by providing them with the justifications they need for shutting us down i.e. muh…private companies can do whatever they want. The old right have become the water-carriers for the new left. They have to go.

            King Tut. There’s only one issue with the leftists and that’s the will to power. Everthing else is rhetoric, devices and tactics. Which is why the fall of the soviet union was such a god send for the western lefties. It trashed the conservatives moral reason for existence. Then the left went hard tword identity politics and environmental activism. The conservatives, libertarians and liberals have no defense against these tactics. As far as  I’m concerned the whole right wing, liberal wing garbage is dead to me. We need to get creative. I have an older post with links to all kinds of great ideas to mess with the left.

        The root of Progressive morality is an existential survival imperative based upon parasitism; which is the demand that Progressives be permitted to endlessly feed upon the productivity of others. As an example, see Bernie Sanders advocating free everything to everyone in exchange for votes and his ascendancy to supreme political being. That works for a while, but sooner or later, the Ponzi scheme collapses and tyranny is the inevitable end result. Ergo, their morality equals totalitarianism. The Soviets made this last for 80 years.

            It’s simple, they demand your stuff, and your fealty.  Why? Because they can.  The rest of it is just rationalizations.  Like my “tear down all the things” comment above, this gets down to a childish “king of the hill” mentality writ large and deadly serious.  Our culture is allowing and supporting all of this, because the larger, more disciplined morality has been beaten out of us.  There is only one way out of this, and it ain’t gonna be pretty.  It is going to be along the lines of “waiting until your father gets home”.

            All of the candidates wish to retain power, but not all of them want to destroy the capitalist system in the process. This is why Socialists (“Socialist Democrats”) go to great lengths to portray their intentions as merely “reforming capitalism” – a portrayal much less likely to scare voters than “redistribution”. Baby steps, baby steps.The difference between Biden/Harris and Sanders is that Sanders intends to deliver on his promises – Biden and Harris do not want to destroy capitalism. Bernie understands that once (for example) student loans are forgiven, the result is the banks will be nationalized. This is not an unwanted side effect that he’s willing to tolerate – it’s the goal.Communists understand and accept that Socialism is a necessary layover   on the way to Communism (in the absence of a full-on, state-backed violent revolution). It took the Soviets decades to finally “solve” the “problem” of ridding Soviet society of the last of the petty bourgeois capitalists, the farmers.) Stalin may have taken his time during this “delay”, but it was not due to any deficiency of violence or misapplication of torture.While AOC may not have been exposed to much historical background at BU, she has nevertheless been fully immersed in Communism’s moral code of Equality Above All Else. She has explicitly expressed that she is willing to sacrifice “bougie freedoms” such as free speech in exchange for equality. In other words, AOC (and her cohorts, generally) may be lacking Stalin’s deep intellectual horsepower, but she has no qualms about sacrificing “whatever it takes” to establish the utopian ideal of Equality.

                    The key to survival is not being tied down to place when TSHTF. In all of the successful guerrilla wars of the past the land/house/village is given up and supplies are gotten on the fly or via clandestine networks. The cowering in place stems from the mistaken idea that the place is of primary importance. It is not the place that is primary, it is the people.

        Thank you Z, and all of you, for continuing to feed my need to understand where we are, while pressing toward action. Would you mind providing some authors that would continue my learning?Also, if history can provide a guide, how did the Confederate Army (or any opposing militia) form, while under trending oppression? Are there authors that have covered this that are not biased to the North?I’m dedicated to quietly looking around my neighborhood and surrounding community but appreciate the efficiency of retroactive studies of what has worked previously.

        You say: “In order to be in opposition to the ruling orthodoxy, you have to be at odds with at least some of its moral foundation.”
Well put, succinct and true.
So: what is the competing moral foundation of the ‘dissident right’?   This is where I see everyone faltering, looking for something and not finding it.   You have those who preach a return to a muscular Christianity, like Vox Day.   And you have those who suggest ethnos as morality, most closely argued by Greg Johnson in his recent book.
What’s the Z plan?

                Let me try again.When I say “plan” I am only referring to what he is prescribing in the article.What part of their moral foundation is he at odds with?   What’s the weakest link.Going to his Buckley example:  Buckley conservatives won the “communism is bad” moral battle, and led the USA to confront Communism.    Buckley  oonservatives refused to confront the claims of Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights movement, and lost the battle, and as a result the racial hegemony of whites was not defended and we ended up with infinite special rights for minorities (soon to include cash payments for slavery!)He’s argued clearly that the fight is over morality: if we accept globohomo’s morality we will end up as ineffective as Bill Buckley.What part has he rejected, what part should we reject?   What is their Achilles tendon &amp; weakest point?    There seem to be many weak points, but are they really?Blank Slate-ism?   Racial reaalism?   Race as foundation of identity?  Only two genders?   Fiscal irresponsibility?Like I said Greg Johnson is pretty clear about what his morality is centered on, and so, in his own way so is. Vox Day.   What is  Zman’s morality based on?  Why does it claim to be different and superior to the orthodox morality?

        Whilst I agree with the premise of this article, I would put forward one further thought.  The reason why it is advantageous to use the endorsement or affiliation of “pick your minority” with OUR positions, is that it is able to punch through the built up propaganda.   One must differentiate between the step-n-fetch-it types like a French or Williamson, and those who really are grounded solidly and simply use proper marketing techniques to get beyond the brainwashing.   Sadly, they are few and far between.  Jesse Lee Peterson and his willingness to have Owen Benjamin come give a talk, strikes me as one.

            As a fisherman, you have to decide when to stop fishing in a spot where there are few bites on your reel.  There are no hard-and-fast rules about when you decide to give up on a spot, but at some point you must.
Conservatives have been trying to create a surge of conservative minorities since Reagan and it has amounted to nothing.  I’ve given up.  When will you?

        Politics in a liberal democracy is theater, not science. The fact that conservatives don’t get that helps explain their demise
That is precisely why Trump won, and will continue to win.  See, e.g., how he put the Democrat menagerie on stage with his demand for border-humanitarian-relief dollars, and is now allowing them to fail for ALL to see, including the Fail Media!

        The question is, why did Cold War conservatism jettison the whole of conservatism except for its anti-communism? Was that the only issue on which the conservatives held the moral high ground? Why the lack of confidence to defend other salient features of conservatism such as freedom of association and defense of America’s distinctly European heritage? Zman, I know you’re not saying conservatives were wrong on those issues, but that almost appears to be the logic of your argument.

            Because the “rest of conservatism” would have involved telling the plain truth about blacks and Jews, and that would have been just too icky.  And costly.
The plain truth is that all of America’s problems from the dawn of the 20th century til now have been caused by blacks and Jews, and the inability of Americans to deal frankly and intelligently with these two problem species.

            I think because those issues interfered with the other big motivator of Conservatism: making money.  Piling up more and more wealth became a proxy for morality (Ayn Rand casts a long shadow) and it soon became clear that hanging on to traditional ways would end up costing.  How can we become rich if our women don’t join the work force?  Don’t you know how much money we’ll save if we buy from China instead of our own countrymen?

        A consistent theme in Z’s arguments is the ineptitude, incompetence, incoherence, etc., of the right.Yet somehow, these attributes do not infect the left.Why?Certainly leftists are not smarter than conservatives?IMHO it’s because the left is not interested in bettering the lives of the citizenry; it’s interested only in taking power.And they do not give flying F**k how they get it.This allows them to say or propose absolutely anything, irrespective of the subsequent consequences, provided the immediate result advances their quest for power.Just look at the results of the myriad policies they have implemented; NONE of them have achieved the promised results.But for the leftist, that is OK.Leftists are literally untethered to any political/social constraints or political ideology other than obtaining, today and now, more power.Conservatives , OTOH, generally do wish to implement policies that encourage individual freedom and economic progress for all. They are constrained by their ideology. This means that real world choices have to be made, thus limiting what can be proposed or “given” to the citizenry.And when choices have to be made, some folks will cry foul.Conservatives appear unable to elucidate TO THE MASSES, why their policies are superior.When is the last time you heard any conservative explain anything in a clear, concise manner?A  leftist will just say, medical care is too expensive and the govt. should provide it for free. Any moron can understand this right away.A free market conservative will say let’s introduce real competition and eliminate the insurance company/hospital/medical society approved price cartels that are FIXING prices and driving up the cost of medical care.This “solution” requires thinking beyond first base and raises all sorts of questions like how is it to be implemented, who will implement it, how much lower will medical care cost, what if does not work, what if some folks still cannot afford medical care, etc., etc.It’s just so much easier to say the govt will provide free health care and yes, the rich will pay for it via higher taxes.End of discussion.As the dumbing down of society proceeds ever faster into the black hole of ignorance, the easier it will be for the left to gain control of the govt.Those that become commissars and members of the nomenklatura will live very very well; they always do.As the reality of high unemployment, lack of opportunity, lower living standards, and higher prices (due to lack of supply) kick in , the citizenry will finally wake up to reality.But by then, it will be too late.The commissars and the nomeklatura will have the guns and their NKVD and Gestapo and total control of the financial system (i.e., the money).Just look at Cuba and Venezuela.

            “Conservatives appear unable to elucidate TO THE MASSES, why their policies are superior.”  You still seem to identify with the conservatives and this is why you ask your questions.
You overlook the constraints of race and the power of tribalism.  You can’t convince many non-whites of the benefits of conservatism because they are, generally speaking, too unintelligent to grasp the issues and even the ones who are intelligent feel a deeper desire for their race to dominate the whites regardless of the costs.
Tribalism is the deepest political force.  Plan accordingly.
