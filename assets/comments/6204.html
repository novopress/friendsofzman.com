        The usual ways in which people have handled the stresses of their lives have greatly diminished over the past few decades. Religious affiliation/participation is down, as is belonging to social community groups, the real, in-person kind, not Facebook “communities”. Do people belong to the Lions club anymore? Kiwanis? How about bowling leagues, once very popular? Under stress people turn first to family, friends, and God, not necessarily in that order. When any of these break down you’ve got a problem. The Internet doesn’t help the situation, either. If you’re spending a great deal of time on the internet via computer, tablet, phone, that is time not spent on interacting with live humans. This kind of detachment is very isolating which is not good for mental health, or longevity.

        My theory would be that purpose of life, and this may fit in variously with the theories already outlined by Z, has become eroded. Why men should feel this more than women is hard to say, but if the figures are right the male seems to lack purpose. We are told that fertilisation can be from a test tube, and there is no need for jobs or even to establish order or the hope of improvement: we have everything so no point in striving. Also, the sloppy leadership we now have will run rather than fight. If you can’t retreat with your leaders, you are  screwed.Currently much of what has been established by white males is in retreat, pushed back by our dusky new friends, sneered at by our own politicians, hammered by the media (curiously both still populated mostly by white males who seem not to have noticed what’s happening around them) and crucified by a process of law that can see only one side of the story.I get the fact that substance abuse is high. It is cheap and easily available, so people get their instant gratification without delay. The purpose of building something in which you will feel good in a year is forgotten in favour of feeling good for an hour right now.Perhaps the two are linked: once a person finds find out that the high is not so great and the feeling good a bit doubtful, there is little point in continuing. It is almost as if everyone wants to get to the highest high and then throw themselves off the top as soon as they are there.

            ” Why men should feel this more than women is hard to say, but if the figures are right the male seems to lack purpose.”I laughed out loud when I read this line, honestly.  Meaning no insult to you but it’s amazing to me that anyone couldn’t see why this felt by men more than women?  But you are a woman (judging by the photo)  and not very many years ago a woman’s place was in the home, women were the homemakers for a thousand years.  Now a woman’s place is in the cockpit of a jet fighter.  Men have abdicated their inherent power and position in the world.  White men have been the tip of the spear for a very long while until recently.  Now virtually nothing requires greater physical ability, technology allows that woman to be a warrior or lead a construction company that she never founded or do countless things that used to require physical strength.  I call women “Men 2.0”  Traditional white males are now redundant, unless we have a full scale world war men are no longer that critical to the advancement of civilization.  I hate the movie “Jurassic Park” It’s a radical feminist movie, they didn’t need males to create new life. all the main characters are female even the dinosaurs.  BTW, that’s the real reason behind woman’s right to choose abortion.  The female has the ultimate right to decide life or death of the species, giving females power and dominance over males. The exact opposite of what has historically been the case.  Brown people are the new alpha males, they’re lagging behind the white cultures that still has the brown males acting as traditional males.  Muslim men see the western males as their future and reject it, they will not give up their birthright without a fight, a big fight.  I’m jumping around here but as “Z” said books can be written on this.

        Maybe the U.S. Is headed in the same direction as Russia. The Soviet Union’s slow-motion collapse was pretty well tracked by its male life expectancy statistics (http://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF124/cf124.chap4.html), which increased steadily after WW2, then turned down during the 70s Brezhnev stagnation, then popped up again during the Glastnost era of the late 80s, and then fell off a cliff when the Soviet Union finally disintegrated. Since White men represent–by far– the most productive part of US society, it makes sense that as the United States begins its collapse, that would also be reflected in white male life expectancy decline here too.

        One word; Feminism.  Zman, the explanations you highlight are much too complicated.  “The Usual Suspect” in the comments nails it; the industrial revolution changed the division of labour and gave rise to Feminism, not as a direct cause, but it paved the way and allowed it to appear in its time.  Every word young people have learned to use to describe life for the last several decades has been calculated to destroy Patriarchy.  For white males, the inheritance has been squandered.  It is gone.
When Patriarchy returns, the need for men with purpose will return as well.

        “Whatever is at the root of the White Death will give way to something more hostile than white guys hanging themselves or overdosing on horse.”  Yep.  The funny thing is, Our Betters the Liberals keep yelling about how Donald Trump is a fascist.  No.  Trump is the only thing standing between us and honest-to-god, jackbooted, armbanded, truncheons &amp; secret police &amp; genocide Fascism.  He’s a clown; the next guy won’t be.  That’s why the phrase is “the lesser of two evils.”

        The Left wants to replicate what is going on in Europe here, and everyone on this thread knows it.  Here’s where we’re headed if we’re not careful (http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/06/leftist-norwegian-politician-gets-raped-by-somalian-begs-for-him-not-to-be-deported/).

        I’ll never benefit from the shade of the trees I plant.I only plant trees that produce “free” food.Fruit trees never get that tall in New HampshireI don’t claim “productive” for letting  the Black Locust “suckers” replace theirfallen elders. I just leave them alone.

        “For whites, this was probably the worst decade for drug abuse, social pathology and cultural decay.”See what you get from cultural appropriation on magic dirt?

        Might be, and probably is, something as simple as demographics. 50 years ago there were more traffic deaths and violent crime because there were more young people behaving irresponsibly.  Now there are more old people moving into the age range where they confront terminal illness. Societies where assisted suicide statistics are kept report that 85 % of the requests are because of a diagnosis of terminal cancer.

            Possibly. The thing is, the phenomenon is not universal. It’s exclusively white. More specifically, it is mostly Scots-Irish.

        Oddly enough maybe none of these is the reason.  The increase in White death rates may be due to women more than men.
http://andrewgelman.com/2015/11/10/death-rates-have-been-increasing-for-middle-aged-white-women-decreasing-for-men/
I don’t have all the numbers handy but I think the rise in the female death rate is concentrated in the South as well.
