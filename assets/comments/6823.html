        I wonder how many lawyers and law school students will soil their undies when they read that.

        Sounds great, especially that robo-judge. If the state brings a case, the judge rubberstamps what they do. And, after getting  billed $50 per email from my lawyer, for stuff I could have written, robo lawyers would be a lot cheaper.

        In the pre-internet days, Nolo Press used to put out some pretty good books with fill in the blank forms for the California market.

        Speaking from 30+ years experience,much of this would be possible – but the acceptance curve would be extensive and lengthy.  My practice is limited to workers’ compensation and related litigation.  In my state, this is primarily an administrative practice involving heavy use of forms, much as suggested here.  It can work and even contested claims can be handled quickly and efficiently, depending almost solely on the lawyers involved.

        (contract law…)but it has been made vastly complicated by a massive bird’s nest of verbiage.Well, you see, after the plagiarism of cut-and-paste from documents written by folks actually familiarwith the law (usually written by undergrads and “paras”), THEN comes the mandatory “mad Libs” fill-in-the-blankbit to break up the pattern recognition.It doesn’t go over so well when an “opinion” of law is so easily recognized as a “disclaimer” from “elsewhere”,(with the “disclaimer” bit removed), nicely printed on expensive letter head/stationary, and charged US$ 2,000fee…down the line.

        We’re actually remarkably close on the contract side.  Have PoC’d two packages that will do side by side contract review, will pull comparable language from prior contracts for comparison and has sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize language regardless of format.  From the perch of my particular industry, don’t see legal jobs as a growth industry.

            After I posted this one, I remembered the name of the company that started the self-service legal business and checked their site. Legal Zoom has an amazing number of self-service options. For small business people, most legal work will be handled by software in the next decade. Leases, service agreements, commercial real estate sales, etc.
To some degree, the massive inflation of the regulatory code is just a jobs program for attorneys. There’s a limit to this.

                We’re using it at the F500 finserv level.  Lloyds now uses to do contract checks for “layered” insurance programs.  But the cognitive capabilities allow the programs to learn and suggest language based on both prior art and judicial outcomes.  Watson (which I’ve done some early stage work on) is a whole different level.  What is more interesting is the degree to which the developers have really not thought out the downstream implications.  Had a dinner table conversation with the IBMers after a demo of one of the early oncology treatment applications of Watson a few years ago,  It was pretty spiffy, especially the capacity to ingest clinical trial data real time.  So I asked how easy it would be to tune the economic algos to weigh patient age against cost so only the optimal economic outcome was recommended.  “Pretty easy”. And patient/doctor would not see other recs? “nope”. So have you been working with an ethicist on this project?  “Hmmm that would be a good idea”.  Nuf sed.

        funny that you mention this.  i’m using nolo quicken willmaker plus for the first time to make a will and related boring documents.  it’s almost fun, though, just answering a long checklist then it spits out a will.  much cheaper and faster than a lawyer, and the concept is pretty close to what you are describing.
