        There are many starting points, but it accelerated under the Clintons for sure. If they are telling the truth about JFK, why haven’t they released all the classified documents after 60 years? And then there is Watergate and the Checkers speech, when Nixon became their whipping boy for committing misdemeanors in an occupation where major felonies are committed as part of the job. Trump says 9/11 was an inside job, I tend to believe it. The slow dribble of information about aliens, they’ve been lying about that too. Global warming? Lie. The woman who helped find the Obama’s birth certificate? Funny way she died. Seth Rich? And Julian Assange being persecuted for telling the … Truth? Who knows what to believe anymore?

        It seems more likely that even trivial  official information is false. The reasoning is that officials are never punished for lying to the public but they certainly are for telling the truth. Snowden and Assange are persecuted as a warning to others with an unhealthy interest in factual truth.Can this go on? Absolutely not. It will succumb to accumulated garbage noise instead of useful information. It is similar to the debt; the fact that it hasn’t collapsed yet is not proof that it won’t. Like the man who fell off the Empire state building and was asked a few floors off the pavement who things were going: “so far pretty good”

                    There was a pretty big outcry with Clinton lying.  It turned almost half the country against him and they never forgave him.  Many of those people I presume have passed on.

                        Legally there’s a good argument that what he did was not perjury. Who wouldn’t lie about something like that they could get away with it? I blame the Republicans for pushing it as much as I blame him. By the time all those hearings were over, it left a bad taste in my mouth about both parties.The bigger problem with the Clinton administration is that they basically put spin on overdrive and lied about the aggressive actions they took running government. I think that’s when statistics first started getting fudged like the way they calculate inflation and all kinds of sloppiness and corruption in government went into high gear. Remember those FBI files they found in the White House?

Nick like to hear some of that argument.  What does “I did not have sex with that woman” mean to you?  If that’s the basis of your argument, it’s not one shared with the common man in the street–Left or Right.

                        May be referring to the “meaning of ‘is’ is” defense, but that is not correct and it was ridiculous.  What he might have argued is it depends on how you define “sex.”
Still, with all the other crimes he committed, going after him for lying about sex seemed petty.  But going after him for his more serious crimes would have implicated many other powerful people so you can’t go there.

                        Lying is not perjury unless what you’re lying about is germaine to the subject matter. If you are on trial for murder and lie about posting about politics on the z blog, that is not perjury.

        ‘The question is whether this is the result of a corrupt and rotten ruling class or is it the inevitable result of democratic society.’It’s a factor, certainly.  But not the core reason.The core reason is that a masculine society is generally oriented towards probity, in all things.  Generally.  1950s America is a decent example.A feminine/feminist society, otoh, is oriented strongly towards deception.  Females skew heavily Left, males Right.  America is a radically Leftist and Feminist nation.  That grew incrementally following passage of the 19th, and it ain’t an accident that totalitarianism and The Lie grew right alongside it.Deception is a central aspect of being female, whether the application of make-up, or the fraud that is female favoritism and supremacy in all institutions, concerns of government, and cultural contexts, whilst maintaining a bogus front of Equality and Equity.  Some being far more Equal than others, as events have demonstrated the past five decades.

            “Deception is a central aspect of being female…”
Yes. When raising my sons, I made sure they understood that all women lie. But not to hold that against them unless necessary, since they are also the future mothers of your children.
In its most benign sense, a woman will lie about little things. You gently deal with that. You need to vet them before their lies about big things destroy your life.
But they all lie. And I am a happily married man of 28 years, partly by understanding reality.

                It is possible for some men really to love a woman if that (rare) man is willing to confront the truth about general, but widespread and endemic, female behavior and nature.  Same for male behavior, far as that goes.It is the duty of men to teach their sons this also, because without such confrontation of reality, their relationships with females usually are founded on illusion and self-deception.  Those men still allowed relationships with their sons, that is.I’m a Christian.  Christ and the apostles were frankly, and sometimes firmly, honest about females and their God-given roles.  Modern pastors conveniently forget about that, because most modern pastors and Christians are cucks and dollarhounds, whattaya gonna do.

                There’s a reason HR departments are staffed almost entirely by women. The *entire* process of job searching (and keeping) is made up of lies the way a log cabin is made of wood. The companies are lying, the questions they ask encourage lying (“give us 3 reasons you want to work here”), the recruiters are lying, and finally the applicants are lying. As habitual liars, women are believed to be perfect for this role. The problem is that they lied to get their jobs as well, have no idea what their employer’s business is really about, and don’t ever intend to learn.

            “In accordance with the foregoing, we find that injustice is the fundamental failing of the female character. It arises primarily from the above-mentioned want of reasonableness and reflection and is further supported by the fact that, as the weaker, they are by nature dependent not on force but cunning; hence their instinctive artfulness and ineradicable tendency to tell lies. For just as nature has armed the lion with claws and teeth, the elephant and boar with tusks, the bull with horns, and the cuttlefish with ink that blackens water, so for their defense and protection has she endowed women with the art of dissimulation. She has bestowed on them in the form of this gift all the force she has given to men in the form of physical strength and power of reason. Dissimulation is, therefore, inborn in women and is thus almost as characteristic of the stupid as of the clever woman; and so to make use of it on every occasion is as natural to her as it is to the above-mentioned animals to make immediate use of their weapons when they are attacked, and to a certain extent she feels that here she is exercising her right. Therefore an entirely truthful and unaffected woman is perhaps impossible.”  Schopenhauer

            Lordy, the local anchor just came on the air amd said that the eclipse today was “amazing, emotional, powerful”.
Emotional?  And this came from a male-presenting reporter.  It’s time, ladies.  Time to go back into the kitchen and leave things to the men.  We can’t sustain this kind of estrogen-soaked society.

                    This is on my mind. Due to some work travel I ended up in ~the area of “totality”. Traffic was snarled and I even saw some fat dudes wandering down the side of the interstate.
I’ve asked a few people, “This wasn’t such a big deal last time, right”.I’m thinking 2017 or so.

            “Deception is a central aspect of being female”Men, traditionally, had to go out into the world to fend and provide for their families.  Even in the West, till the mid 1950s the world was a harsh and unforgiving place. Men who faced reality as it was stood the best chance of survival.Because men protected women from reality, women could live in their fantasy world of deception.Now that women have been given their wish of being “equal”,  most recoil from it and still want their feminine privileges.Where men have failed is at being men. When women came up with the nonsense “Trust all women”, real men would have  laughed  at them and tossed the slogan in the trash can of history.

        In addition to lying, is the condescending attitude of all mainstream media. They address the audience at a third-grade level. The general entertainment and other TV offerings are the same. It’s insulting but also alarming that this is getting worse – more ridiculous all the time.“You don’t want to miss the eclipse, but if there’s a tornado warning, don’t take chances with your life.”Very tiring actually. And this constant chatter (i.e. lie) about “climate change” is going to push someone over the edge. Climate change on a planet that is purported to be 4 billion years old. That fact itself is … never mind.

        I would argue that Colin Powell lying in UN about Iraq’s WMD and conservatives going with it was the defining moment.
Clintons were sleazy, and everyone on the conservative arena pointed that out. Conservatives also argued that they were better than the lying Clintons. By allowing the war against Iraq to happen on false pretense, they lost the moral high ground.
From that point on, it was a race of which politician came up with the bigger whopper.

            Interesting idea. I think the Clinton’s smashed the idea that there has to be some respect for the truth. The aggressive lying turned honesty into a vice. The neocons introduced a type of perfidy in which you create a false authority or a false premise and quickly build a logical framework on it.For example, the neocons started with the assertion that if you knew some world leader would be Hitler, would you do anything possible to topple him? Abstractly it is an easy answer, but before anyone can think about they claim someone world leader is Hitler and therefore we are morally obligated to do anything necessary to stop him.This way of conjuring monsters has become universal.

                “The [GWB administration] aide said that guys like me were ‘in what we call the reality-based community,’ which he defined as people who ‘believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.’ […] ‘That’s not the way the world really works anymore,’ he continued. ‘We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do’. –Ron Suskind, “Faith, Certainty and the Presidency of George W. Bush”.

                I think the switch was thrown with Anita Hill.  Not only did she fabricate all of her accusations and offer no proof, she got away with it against one of the most protected classes in society…even in the early 1990’s.
Granted, that was an election year, and her little stunt was intended to deflect from the Clintons.  But I think that was the inflection point.

            That’s an interesting argument, Paul, and the same could be applied to the Gulf of Tonkin or even The Maine. I think the Clintons’ contribution was that they made lying cool and acceptable. That’s not as lethal, obviously, but saying the quiet part out loud spiraled out of control in short order. The public bears huge responsibility for what has happened because lying would have not have been normalized without that widespread admiration of those who did it routinely and sometimes well.

            Paul, I would argue that an even more “defining moment” was when Clinton lied and said we need to bomb Iraq “because WMD” and ordered Operation Desert Fox… the night before the House was to hold an impeachment vote.

                Was it Iraq or Libya? I remember being utterly furious because Slick was condemning people to death as a means of trying to stave off his own impeachment. That was as evil a deed as any US president has ever committed.

        Excellent poast, Z.You are indeed correct that dishonesty is the coin of the realm but the outcome is not in doubt to anyone except the chilliest of the grillers. All fiat currencies eventually fail. This is an historical fact. Often you will find jews heavily represented among the drivers and enablers of that failure too. The second Nixon took the currency off the gold standard – our future was graved in stone. I’m surprised it has taken as long as it has.When the economy fails the four horsemen will have a field day. The fix is easy and fortunately we see many on our side of the divide prepping to implement it. Merit will replace deceit as the coin of the realm and when it does, the four horsemen will have to head for the hills. It’s not like there will be any choice. Yes, things will get so bad, that the only way to do things will be the right way.White superiority and domination of the world was no accident. By nature we will build empires and civilizations that are a good deal for everyone. In ancient Rome even most slaves lived better than the barbarian tribes. I think I read somewhere that Zimbabwe, of all places – is tying its currency to gold. They’re begging whites to return so that the lights and plumbing work again. If they restore those whites to positions of authority – they’ll have a decent shot at saving themselves. People like to liken the American Empire to that of Ancient Rome. They forget that the Roman Empire rose and fell and periodically reinvented itself to clean out the grifters, incompetents and perverts from the ruling class. The ol’ nickle about “it starts at the top, and rolls downhill” is a truism as old as mankind himself. Our current leaders are dead men walking, figuratively and possibly literally speaking. They are unleashing forces they don’t understand or control.Once they are gone, saving, investing, defending and sacrificing for the greater good will make sense again too.

            Filthie:  Any Whites that are stupid enough to return to Zimbabwe – under any pretenses – deserve their fate.  Who is going to be left to build these civilizations of which you dream?  And where?  (Poland just passed a hate-crime law.)  Look, I believe utterly in the historical superiority of the White race, but . . . we are not those people.  IQ has been dropping for over 100 years.  Whites are under attack and in retreat all over the globe.I’m not counseling despair, but realism.  Sure, hang around certain blogs and you’ll read endlessly of this supposed vast number of White vets and gun owners up in the hills and all over the country, just itching to kick things off.  And they all wear thick glasses and can’t get back up on their own after taking a knee.  I don’t doubt the capabilities of White men overall, but the will, the self confidence, and the coordination is not there.I’d suggest a bit less bombast and a bit more caution.

Even in the middle of the 20th century, the nation was full of reasonably bright, largely hard working white folk.  Take a look  at places like Ohio today, or Minnesota, etc.  The population is black, immigrant and the white population is increasingly kind of retarded.
Demographics being destiny, we are f**ked and cannot hold a country of this size.

                    Nonsense.“Demographics is destiny?” What rot! Tell that to the Boers in South Africa. A handful of whites defeated and controlled legions of black animals. As did the British, the Germans and all the other white imperialist nations.All empires rise and fall and I am not sure our esteemed host has the right of it on this: I believe his view is that they get to big and expensive to run. I am not so sure… I think empires rot from within. To run an empire, you need lots of smart, competent, driven men. The old nickel about “good men creating good times, weak men produce hard times”  – is true. Look at our culture: it isolates and emasculates its best men – and empowers faggots, bitchy women and retarded vibrants. If we reversed that our fortunes would start improving immediately.

                I’m not telling anyone what to think, 3G, just bloviating out loud. Not to sure about the idea of the IQ drop. Are we getting stupider? Or lazier? Academically speaking they probably look very much alike. When you consider what’s happened to our teachers and public schools…some sort of institutionalized stupidity is inevitable. Intellectual potential is an inherited genetic trait.I am looking at things long term, here. Short term… you are absolutely right. We are ever so effed. The only reason we are in these straights is because we can afford to be – or at least, so we think. If you look at the average dirty thirties depression era dirt people and compare them to their counterparts today… oh boy, I see a WORLD of difference.When things get really bad, Whitey is going to have to either smarten up or get culled. I don’t see that happening. You may not have noticed… but classical dissidence is going mainstream already.You really shouldn’t take me too seriously, either. I am getting old, I am not in touch with things the way younger people are, and as a result I am frequently wrong about things.

        For the great majority, certainly more than 90%, truth is whatever authority says it is and that is good enough for them. They are ready to be directed to use force to make it good enough for you too. Most people are born to be slaves, expendable worker bees in the various hives of humanity around the planet. Those civics programs of the past were still just vehicles for filling in the otherwise empty minds of the herd, it was just done in a more white and therefore more civilized way for a more white and civilized population. A more brown population needs a more brown style of communication to convey to them what to think, that is, what words to recite on a given subject regarding how everyone ought to behave.If these assertions are correct what is the point of a dissident movement? What should its goals be? It can’t be to convince enough free thinking people to march out and vote back into existence a more free thinking and self actualizing society any more than it could be get everyone to learn to fly by flapping their arms.

            What ho, Tashtego! Let me hear thy hammer.Your point regarding the general decency’s decline is simply a reflection of shifting demographics, not that it is inherently more perfidious than before, is well-put. What many decry as the Boomers or Grillers’ mindset is the indoctrination the Boomers received as youths, which now, simply, becomes more silly as the society shifts. The heightened contrast only shows how silly the Boomer mindset was, not that it was an inherently different color in the past.

                “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale;”That question in the first comment wasn’t intended to be rhetorical. I was hoping for thoughts on what a dissident movement should apply itself towards accomplishing. If you accept the premise that the vast majority have no true political or even moral agency, and I think the covid hysteria alone demonstrated the truth of this assertion, the political goals of a challenger for power cannot coherently espouse anything resembling democratic ideas about how society ought to be organized and administered. At least not sincerely, though pretending to has obvious utility in flattering those to be controlled.

            I think what you’re seeing is the failure of our society to absorb the thinking men from the herd of ape-things.  The anti-white stuff has accelerated it and the regime is rapidly creating a counter-elite of people who would rather burn everything to the ground than live as serfs in the Brave New World hell they have planned for the great brown ape horde.
Lucky for us the children of the regime have regressed to the ape-like mean of IQ and aren’t likely to be successful in creating their bug eating utopia.

        The most recent howler I’ve seen occurred during the national semifinal games of the Final Four. At courtside, there was a digital billboard advertising this thing or that, or offering hortatory or supposedly edifying bromides. But there was one, in particular, that really caught my eye. It said, “The NCAA celebrates student-athletes.”Hoo boy. What an obvious whopper. For all intents and purposes there are no student-athletes in big-time college hoops anymore, and the NCAA knows this better than anybody. NIL (Name-Image-Likeness) is a huge money fund to play players, and no-fault transfer rules are the college game’s free agent racket.These are not student-athletes who diligently attend classes, write papers, take test and get degrees in quantum thermodynamics (or even sociology). Nope, they are well-compensated hired guns whose only acquantance with the university is the basketball program. They are employees, not student-athletes.But the NCAA, in an attempt to head off rampant cynicism from fans about the sport, try to gaslight the more gullible among them into thinking it is still 1994 when student-athletes were the rule rather than the rare exception. Sheerest disinformation from the very sort of people who claim to be fighting it.

            Maybe I’m just out of the loop now, but it seems like there is no interest in or chatter about the men’s playoffs. The only talk I’ve heard has been about the Iowa women. Hopefully the NCAA is dying slowly, not fast enough for me though. There used to be betting pools on the brackets and everywhere and I haven’t anyone talk about their brackets at all this year. Maybe though it’s because I don’t hang out with jock-sniffers.

        Resegregation and mass deportation.Give blacks 13% of the land, fair enough. They can call it it Wakanda.But there really is no other solution. White Christians need their own countries again. The rest have to go back or be given a percentage, but multicult has failed. It’s done, nothing will be fixed until we address the root problem.People prefer to live amongst themselves, forcing a bunch of different people together has been terrible. It needs to stop.

            The great thing about calling multiculturalism a failure is leftists are forced to agree with you. Since if it is a success there is no need for all their DIE “equity” programs. So we actually do have a common “starting point” with the left on race relations.

                Kuntsler.
The whole IDF/Hamas conflict made some of them break cover pretty egregiously. No going back and pretending to be ‘conservatives.’ They should just register as foreign agents and be honest.
Wait! Isn’t the topic today about a lack of honesty?

                    Yeah, never going to look at James Kunstler in an uncritical way again. Scratch a supposedly secular jew, and underneath you find another fervant, uncritical Tribesman.
I have also taken to rethinking acceptance of his collapse ideas; they do tend to reinforce the “You will own nothing, and you will be happy” POV rather closely. Hmm.

                    I don’t agree. Candace Owens told a rabbi to his face that he has no right to put his religion over hers. That’s why she was fired. Now, maybe you think that the Daily Wire is playing 18th-dimensional chess. Nevertheless, she said the thing that is probably the most horrible and offensive thing you can say to a Jew, which is that their religion is not superior to your dumb goyim subhuman Amalek religion. No matter what, she said it.

        Some lies and deceptions are worse than others. Once again, to the root.Legislators do not meet in conference on the floor of the Senate or House to debate and synthesize good law on behalf of the people they serve. Those halls remain empty and are only visited sporadically by lone legislators to give canned speeches for appearance purposes. They are actors emoting to an empty theater, with no purpose other than subterfuge. All legislation is written by lobbyists and all votes are contrived. Everything about this charade is a lie.But it works, in  the sense that it keeps normie fooled and on the couch. But the price of this Great Lie is that the stooges must find a way to keep the plates spinning no matter what. For they suspect, if not know subconsciously, that when the plates fall there will be Hell to pay.The plates are wobbling.

Exactly right.  I always get a kick out of it when someone says things like “the elites are really worried now!”.  Bullshit, they haven’t a care in the world except where they will get their next bag of blow, which mistress they will bang tonight and how many millions their insider trade will net them.

                I understand your reaction and emotion, but defeatism is not a cure for anything. You control you, and you can apply yourself toward whatever solution you may deem as potentially effective. If you have a conception of what will happen in the future, then your obligation is to come up with a remedy, not complain that one doesn’t exist. Think outside the box and use your brain for good outcomes not despair.

                Yes, I am aware of the dystopian predictions of what awaits us when the manufactured collapse occurs. And whatever comes to pass, the average American can do nothing to prevent this outcome. I don’t think we can either educate or scare normie into awareness; the weakest among us will eagerly acquiesce to servitude verse starvation.But millions will rebel and fight back. And if they focus on the root of the problem and utilize their ancestral innovative and work-ethic abilities, we can make a real existential fight of it. Drones are a game-changer, and every basement, garage, and storeroom is a ray of hope. Nowadays, everyone seems to be beating up on Gen Z, but they can become Hellacious PFV pilots given their massive videogaming experience. I like our chances.

        Sometimes it takes me a while to catch up on pop culture. Over the weekend I finally got around to watching Terry Gilliam’s Brazil. My big takeaway was the “We’re In It Together” billboard. I wonder what the covid cultists would think about that if they watched it now. Mostly a rather incoherent if entertaining movie.I didn’t start out avoiding pop culture for ideological reasons, but in the long run I think it has served me well, and now I see the pragmatic reasons to do so. When you consume it, it affects you, frequently in ways you aren’t aware, and this includes integrity. No doubt I am already so affected to some degree, we all are. Same thing happens with “the news.” Thanks to many years of avoiding it, when I see it now, such as the TVs on the wall in the gym tuned to Fox and CNN, it appears as something from a dystopian sci fi movie (like Brazil). But for someone continually immersed in the effluvia, it seems normal. As it would to me too, with that much exposure. It’s not that my mind is stronger, it’s that my mind has been better defended.Imagine a young person growing up today and their first experience of governmental public relations are KJP press conferences. But is that really so new? For as long as I can remember, people have expected politicians to lie. It’s normal. I think the difference, when I was young, was “journalists” weren’t expected to lie.TDS made all of this worse. Now it’s perfectly justifiable to falsify all manner of things, from the census to the ballot signature, because if you don’t, the Bad Orange Man might get re-elected! But before there was TDS there was BDS, I remember it well, it afflicted most of the same people, so there’s something deeper going on than mere partisan politics.

        The economic numbers that the Brandon entity issues once a month are in full “Soviet boot production” mode. They’re just completely fake. The chances that the official numbers outpace all the indicators’, every single month, for three years, is zero. It’s just not possible. Yet, the media will present them uncritically and then bring out their “disinformation experts”, a discipline that did not exist before 2017, to tell you why you have to believe them. As the Soviet Union proved, though, at some point reality will collide with the make-believe, and the make-believe will lose. Already, on some level, it is losing, because Americans aren’t buying the fake numbers and the media is losing their minds over that. Every month we get articles of the “Brandon’s economy is amazing, why don’t the chuds get it?” But that is the least of the consequences of all this BS.

            The disconnect between the GDP numbers and what people are feeling in their personal lives is interesting.
According to the official numbers, the economy red hot and unemployment about as low as it can go. Yet, Biden remains unpopular and people still feel uneasy about the economy.
Something doesn’t add up.
The govt is running a huge deficit which is pumping up the economy, but people aren’t feeling it.

                They are inflating their way to “prosperity.” (Financialization is really just a euphemism for inflation). They can goose asset prices, such as stocks and real estate, but the only wages they can goose are those of government jobs. In fact, the goosed asset prices are dependent on suppressed wages. So what the average person sees are houses he can’t afford and a McDonald’s menu that seems like it should come with a white tablecloth and French speaking waiter.
I don’t think you can goose asset prices forever though. I think there’s a limit.

                    Which is why it is interesting to see shitlibs start whining about muh shrinkflation and muh corporate profits. Obviously they got their marching orders because they are all saying this. Now, I know the smart ones (like Robert Reich) are just making a political calculation here, that blaming inflation on some vague notion of “corporate greed” is better than blaming the government for printing too much money. Thing is, higher corporate profits and goosed up asset prices is like a relief valve for inflation. If corporate profits weren’t increasing then it would just be circulating around the economy driving up prices even more. Which of course, brings us to the real point, that this prosperity really isn’t prosperity, it is (literally) paper prosperity.

                    Inflation would be the obvious culprit, but real GDP (above inflation) is supposedly running ~3% to 4%, which is way above its long-term average.In addition, supposedly, wage growth has been significantly higher than inflation for the past year – though it was lower for the year before.Unemployment is extremely low, real wage growth is supposedly great. Yet, no one seems very happy about the economy. Again something isn’t adding up. Could just be that the numbers are wrong, but they’re using the same methodology as they have in the past, so it can’t be that different.Could just be that the inflation numbers aren’t reflecting reality, so real GDP and wage grow might be higher than CPI but lower that real inflation.

                        Long ago, I worked an economic consulting firm. Everyone knew that the data was questionable at best, but it is was still useful if kept in a consistent manner.
It would at least tell you the direction something was heading. I think of GDP data like that. It’s directionally correct.

                        Government is running a $1.7T deficit that is blowing past all prior projections, one reason is that tax receipts are not what they thought it would be. Since tax receipts are tied to the amount money people and businesses are earning in the economy, that should be enough to tell you that something is wrong with the numbers. The fact that inflation remains “stubborn” likely has to do with the fact that the government continues to print too much money.That said, government spending is counted as part of the GDP. When you’re blowing through deficit records, it will be reflected in the GDP. Now, I know, on some level, this is basic Keynesian economics (put aside your feelings on Keynesian economics). It’s the idea that government should step up and spend big in down times to keep the economy moving. To which, I would say – exactly! I think the lesson that Dems learned from Obama’s first term is that they did not do enough Keynesian economics and got punished for it in the elections.

                Citizen,Yeah, the economy (whatever that means and how it’s measured) sure doesn’t seem to be that great. Perhaps it is an economy that I cannot see very well, being a man of yesterday – you know, high street shops and all that; a bustling little market town.Perhaps it’s all digi-dollars, bits and financial tinkering? Who knows.But I know one thing that is very telling; when I was younger, in the early nineties, my Home Counties town had a huge array of white, English owned shops: butchers, bakers, grocers, healthfood shop, plumbers shop, electricians shop, undertakers, banks, estate agents, trophy/fishing supply shop, furniture shop, antiques restorer, jewellers, small supermarkets, pubs, video shop, bike shop, tea room, window fitters, post office, and on and on.We had a handful of ethnic run restaurants – some were actually very good, but the town wasoverwhelmingly white.Now, what do we have? A lot of boarded up, unused shops. Kebab houses by the dozen. Fried chicken houses by the dozen. Asian mini-markets. The complete (proper) diversity of an English town has been transformed inside a generation. It’s incredible.So maybe, according to the state, the economy is doing well – but it sure isn’t the economy I see!Maybe it’s the same in the US?

                        That was one of the big economic lessons from Covid. A huge portion of jobs are simply unnecessary or provide marginal benefit to society.
That the real economy continued to function pretty well despite a huge portion of the workforce staying home says that a large percentage of jobs are pointless.

                    I see this as I walk around my town here in So Cal. There are store fronts, and strip malls, small shopping centers for mom and pop size businesses everywhere. Most of of the storefronts are empty. I notice there is no commerce going on in any of the occupied stores. Weight lifting, Exercise, Nail parlors, Massage Parlors, Hair stylists, We Buy Gold. There are some few Asians with fast-food franchises, but other that that there is no buying and selling of goods, only services.And as fast as those malls empty they are bulldozed for high density housing. Right around the corner from me there was a small nursery that had been in business since the 1950’s. Now the property has a hundred and some new condominium homes (apartments) crammed in like Manhattan, and selling for close to a million bucks a pop.JWM

                The deceit goes at least a couple layers farther down than the people who invent GDP.Every online job opening causes application overload and companies don’t even give automated courtesy acknowledgements let alone evaluate any of them. /pol/ is full of human chatbots claiming to be small contractors or IT shops who can’t find anybody to do anything for any price. Every fourth business has a big sign in the window: WE’RE HIRING.They are not hiring.I know the “clever” nerd excuse: Automated HR programs are rejecting every applicant and the people who do the hiring never see them.I know the Job Creator™ reason: Nobody American be hired until the white population is impoverished out of existence and replaced with the world’s stinkiest rapists.I know the normie Republican small businessman line: I would sooner die in the gutter than give a LOSER ten dollars (when inflation = fifty).Etc.But why do apparent innocents participate in this? Why does everybody *pretend* nobody will work anywhere? Why hasn’t Mike Rowe been beaten to death? What’s the scam?

            I take all claims of being an “expert” with a giant grain of salt and dismiss whatever BS flows out of their mouths. In nearly all cases, the “expert” being presented is abusing the term as if it were a credential.  It’s like the term “Green” in that it means absolutely nothing.  Like what the heck is a “disinformation expert?”  Says who?  What objective criteria is involved?  They are just spin artists.

                Before there were so-called “disinformation experts,” there were so-called “fact checkers.” And they were equally mendacious.
All of it is a desperate attempt to impose objective closure on the issues of the day. Desperate because the Power Structure realizes they are losing control of the narrative and far too many people are rejecting their lies.

        “Hypocrisy is a tribute that vice pays to virtue.” – Duc de La Rochefoucauld
I think the rituals of a Republic have tremendous meaning to the Normies. So the hypocrisy is understandable. The “press briefings” and other Regime communications are rituals which, if suspended, would alarm the Normies.
They will have the State of the Union amidst the flaming wreckage of the Capitol and proclaim that everything is under control.

            Exactly. The Roman Senate apparently kept meeting right up until the 7th century.All we see on TV is just institutional inertia. The Evening News is a prime example. CBS Sunday Morning. 60 Minutes. The Today Show. Those used to be enormously influential but now nobody but the most ritual-bound Boomer watches them. Yet they still carry on as if we haven’t moved past 1996.There are a lot of Boomers – we live in a gerontocracy after all – so these shows will die hard. The good news is the legacy media-political industry’s days are numbered. The revolution comes one funeral at a time.We’ve been seeing signs of the revolution for years now. It just happens so slowly that few notice it. People will walk away one by one, leaving the dull or uncreative to take over what used to be influential positions. But the influence will have gravitated elsewhere. The Senate will be meeting in togas but most people will know that their lives are controlled not by the SPQR but by their feudal lords and the Christian Church. And nobody wears togas anymore, just as soon nobody will wear suits anymore. (See Zelensky, Bukele, Fetterman.)

                My wife was going through channels on Sunday night a few weeks ago.  60 Minutes was doing a propaganda hit piece on Russia.  The lies were so easily identified it took no research to notice them.  I called them out on each until she changed the channel.

                        Something about what a bad man Putin is.  Then they road the train through Lithuania to Kaliningrad showing all the western propaganda along the was in Lithuania, then the Russian passengers disembarking.  Of course, not a single one of those Russians was interviewed or asked to comment on the bs, that would have interfered with the narrative that CBS was pushing so hard.

        And speaking of Ben Shapiro, I used to hear him on the radio in L.A. before he got (really) famous. He was on Salem’s station, with Heidi Harris, a conservative radio personality from Las Vegas, and Brian Whitman, who was best known for being on the air with Tim Conway Jr., doing a non-political show.Whitman was and is on the political left, but everyone who has worked with him says he’s a pro, unfailingly polite and generally good to work with. Yet Shapiro was constantly browbeating and bullying him on the air to the point that I felt sorry for the guy. Harris was gone within a year and returned to Vegas, my guess being that she asked to be let out of her contract because Shapiro was such a prick to his colleagues.Not exactly surprising, is it?

            Back in the day before he was ultra-famous, Shapiro showed up on Red Ice. He will probably now deny he ever gave an interview there, but it was to shill one of his boilerplate conservative books about the media. The hosts asked pointed questions about Jewish involvement  in Hollywood and how people were supposed to fight back against an ethnically and politically united cultural force by all acting as individuals.He, of course, had no answer, and had a sort of “how dare you” demeanor through the interview. It might take a few years, but eventually it becomes clear who is being propped up by a PR machine.

            Some time ago, a famous video did the rounds of Shaprio telling some tranny former helicopter pilot (man -&gt; woman conversion, if you must know, bigot!), that “facts don’t care about your feelings!”. The tranny threatened to “send the little boy home in an ambulance”.
At the time, I thought Shapiro great; now, I rather wished he had been given a good clobbering by the, ahem, “madam”!
Still, we live and learn.

        Think about how stupid someone has to be to say something like “in order to protect our democracy, we cannot reveal the January 6th footage.”It is remarkable that there are people who believe that telling someone this gives it any validity.That being said, I’m amazed at leftist sycophants that actually believe some of these things, so I understand why they say these whoppers.  It works.I know a guy who believes that no one lost their job due to Covid, that didn’t know that a diversity officer at companies was a real thing and was also convinced that there is no crisis at the border.With people amongst us this stupid, can you really blame the regime for coming up with the whopper of whoppers?

        Maybe our love affair with Caitlin Clark and IOWA women’s basketball is partly due to feeling a moment’s respite from the lies. No one can beat corporate S.C. and Dawn Staley (credit to them anyway) but the IOWA ladies’ heart and soul shines a non-eclipsed light on something we might hope, for a few minutes, is real.
And be kind to the ridiculous, AI generated kewpie doll who runs the make believe White House press conferences. She’s just doing her thing same as the others.

                Maus:  Spot on.  All meant to demoralize Whites and constantly remind them of their place  . . . at the bottom of Klown world’s hierarchy.  Same reason every poster, every ad, every school book features non-Whites and characters named Malik and Juan.  And while it’s painfully obvious to those of us who see it, the average White is marinated in it from birth – has been for decades now, and it’s just ordinary reality to him.

                    Ostei:  And to make a heroine of a White female who is still eschewing husband and family for fame and a career.  Just like J.K. Rowling is held up as some champion of women.  She would hurl you into the void if you commented on White replacement, but is to be venerated by cuckservatards as their champion.Just like some here liked Ramaswamy or like Candace Owens.  And I’ll get the usual responses that I’m rejecting the good in favor of purity spiraling.  And I’ll answer, as usual, that at this point in Whites’ struggle for survival, grasping for supposed allies who are not pro-White, but merely oppose the excesses of the left for their own people’s sake, is the same as losing before engaging in battle.  Brett Weinstein, anyone?  Candace Owens?  RFK jr? They are not on your side.

        A case in point of an issue we are not permitted to speak candidly about: Abortion.Right now on Zero Edge, there is an article up with the title “Trump says abortion should be decided by the states.” The whole idea that it should be decided “by the states” was typical of the GOP’s theatrical opposition toRoeso the could pretend to be against abortions but not really have to face the issue squarely.Obviously, the question of whether or not you can kill a baby for your own convenience is not something you can fail to have an opinion about. It is simply a copout to prescind from this vitally important question to  relatively esoteric debate about whether it should be decided at the state or federal level.Politicians will not simply come out and say that abortion is wrong because this means the end of the modern American social experiment, full stop. If you cannot terminate your unwanted babies, it means the end of women’s liberation, the end of casual “dating,” the end of go-girl feminism, and the end of most female education, certainly most university education and a complete readjustment even of high school education.No male politician is willing to take this step because he would be savaged by women and destroyed by all the other male politicians pretending to be “feminists.” The sacrifice of millions of aborted babies is the price we pay for men not standing up to women.Feminism is certainly not an ideology or a political movement that women could have generated on their own. It is ever maintained and enforced by beta-male simps in politics refusing to protect the unborn and put the women in their place.

            Abortion is a culture war-distraction. There is no moral much less political imperative to keep your enemies from going extinct. Trump is correct: you want to fight liberals aborting future liberals go do it in the State legislatures.

            Leaving it to the states was always the conservative position. Their argument against Roe was that it violated the federalist system and undermined the philosophy of the law. The courts should have stayed out of it. Moral arguments for or against abortion and limits on abortion were a separate issue. Trump is a man of his time in this regard.
As far as the morality of abortion, it is a good proof that you cannot reason your way to a universal moral code.

                    Nope. The muds continue to spawn feral, stupid offspring with reckless abandon. Yet the white birthrate is below replacement in every Westernized country.Abortion exists so that white college girls can shed a healthy, 115 IQ white baby they conceived at a drunken frat party where they were so wasted they can’t remember who they fucked.Why? So they can become some mid-level corporate manager or mid-level bureaucrat for ZOG.Sarah Weddington, the woman argued Roe v. Wade, had gone to Mexico to shred the only child she ever conceived so she could finish law school and become… a staff lawyer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.You go, girl…

                        Yes, Jack, I’ve seen those statistics. Colored women avail themselves of abortion more frequently, but the white women use birth control more frequently and successfully. Consequently the colored abortion rate is higher, the white birthrate is lower.In any event it was not and is not colored women who are abortion’s most fervent lobbyists. It is white college-educated women and liberal Republicans — like Harry Blackmun and Nelson Rockefeller, who died while fucking his fifty-years-younger secretary. I’m sure if he had gotten her pregnant he would have gotten rid of the problem for a couple hundred bucks instead of paying child support for 18 years…

                    In a way the Democrats shot themselves in the foot with their fervent support for abortion, especially taxpayer-funded. If all those black babies weren’t aborted the vast majority would have become loyal Democrat voters and several swing states would have been firmly blue.

                The whole point of thinking about morality and ethics is so that we can arrive at a system of social interactions that are as harmonious as it is humanly possible. Since the people of New England have views on abortion very different from the people in other parts of the country, it stands to reason that we should not try to fashion a national policy on abortion. Sending it to the states, which can also send it to counties and cities, is the most reasonable way to settle the abortion issue.One can think abortion is murder and also accept that we have to have a variety of legal regimes in order to keep the peace.

                    Prior to ROE, this was exactly the situation. In addition to the fanaticism, the public is far more ignorant and dumber now and unable to grasp the federalism issue.

                    “One can think abortion is murder and also accept that we have to have a variety of legal regimes”That is absolutely true from a legal and Constitutional standpoint. A good analogue is capital punishment. It is absolutely killing a living human being. In some jurisdictions it is regarded as abhorrent, in others as just and good. Either way, the Constitution neither mandates it nor prohibits it.However, from a racial and cultural standpoint, the White Race and the West simply cannot survive the refusal of white women to reproduce.It cannot survive the insistence of white women that they shred their conceived-but-unborn white offspring and substitute husband and family for a job and cats, so they can be good corporate slaves and enrich the globalist swine by spending their wages on Chinese-manufactured shit purchased on their cell phones from Amazon and delivered by Negroes to their front door.

                    But that begs the question. Why is harmony with the deliberately dis-harmonious something to contemplate? Isnt it the case that trying to find peace with those who fundamentally oppose peace is futile and self-destructive? Should we be looking to live at peace with ritual baby-sacrificers? What about yoof scholars with a taste for the nonconsentual lighter meat, should we be looking to have social harmony with them? Or men in sundresses chasing kids into bathrooms, what rules do we need to live peacefully with the NAMBLA crowd?Arent all of those things over the line, beyond the pale, areas where reasonable men cannot differ, and any attempted difference is clear proof of absolutely evil degeneration rendering any attempt at “getting along” fundamentally impossible?

                Has the shockingly high rate of abortion among American blacks had a eugenic effect on them? Apparently the opposite.People who try to understand what the hell is wrong with black people often ascribe their criminality/etc to their having no sense of a conditional future. The conservative weenie version of this observation has the words “culture” and “consequences” in it. Of course we know better. They’re just like that.Blacks who get abortions don’t have a *strong version* of this mental defect. They’re sending their best to the abbatoir. So the choice isn’t so much between more or less as between more or worse—increasingly worse, probably.

                Tired Citizen:  Abortion has been around since women first got pregnant.  There’s a reason you find laws and prohibitions against it in every century and civilization – women have been killing their children since the beginning.  And men have made laws trying to keep them from doing so.  As much as I abhor abortion for Whites (it is a clump of cells if they don’t want it and it’s a baby with a gender reveal party if they do), at this point I am with you – let those who are not on our side kill themselves off.  Helps keep their numbers down.  And no, I was never moved to pity – even as a child – watching the eponymous commercials begging for aid to Africa – showing back kids with flies crawling over their faces. They just grossed me out.

            The issue I have with Trump’s abortion position is the whole rape/incest loophole he favors.  It basically removes any restrictions whatsoever.  If a woman shows up at an abortion clinic 8 months pregnant and says she was raped, what proof is required?  Did she file a police report at the time? No, she says she was drugged at a party and doesn’t know who did it.  Or was too ashamed, or whatever.  To believe state RINOs are going to require hard proof of rape is wishful thinking.  Same with the “health of the mother” loophole.  I’ll be sad if I have to deliver my baby and put it up for adoption, so I need to kill it for my health.

            That is too harsh. My views are this:
Most women want children and don’t want to work full time. Thus we should make it easier for the economy to do that. No more need for daycare and other stuff.
Most of the other issues would fall into place if that was done. Hasn’t the journalist Louise Perry said something to this effect?

        Kamala Harris’s claim this week that “women’s (NCAA) teams were not allowed to have brackets until 2022,” is one of the most bewildering and bizarre lies of this or any year.  The more I think about such an easily disprovable claim, the more my head spins.

            The spin was that Kamala meant to say the women’s tournament wasn’t allowed to use the term March Madness in marketing until 2022.  Kamala is so stupid she really believes this would have a negative impact on the women’s tournament and that millions of viewers didn’t watch for this reason and not for the more obvious one, that it is women’s basketball.  When the viewership falls off by 50-60% next year because Caitlin Clark is no longer playing at Iowa I wonder what the excuse will be.

        Classic! As a former DC newspaper reporter, I wish that I’d said it:
“The only way to read the news is to first start with the assumption that the truth is from the set of things not mentioned in the news. If you see your picture in the news with your name in the caption, you best check your birth certificate as it is a good chance you are not who you think.”

        Stephen Colbert — before he metamorphized into a late night scold — went on Fox News’. No Spin show and joshed that he was dizzy from stopping spinning after all the spinning he was used to. The great irony is that he spins — lies — more than ever now.Putting a slant on news is popular because people like to imagine they can successfully manipulate viewers. With trust in the media at an all-time low, this way of thinking has clearly backfired. As the saying goes, you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all of the people all of the time. If the Washington Post is right and “Democracy dies in darkness,” then they’re propagators of an all encompassing blackness …

            I blame trump ( why not they blame him for everything else). When he crashed into the limelight running for president and actually having the gumption to change from a D to an R in New York no less he broke all their eggs in their one and only basket. He started a completely new mental illness that was named after him “Trump derangement syndrome”. and it’s only gotten progressively worse.There is not one branch of the government not one department not one agency not one cabinet position that I would believe a statistic from with my life depends on it especially from that bushy headed black dyke with the French name.

        Why must something be done about the blizzard of lies, and more importantly, how would that even happen? The dumb majority is increasing by leaps and bounds, and the smart fraction not only has diminished but is under constant threat of banishment–or worse–if it questions either the official narrative or pervasive lies that fall outside the mandated falsehoods.The GAE in general and the United States in particular already are low trust societies despite some admittedly large pockets that have yet to get the memo. The worst part is it doesn’t even require a midwit to lead the estupidfied masses at this point. Somewhat less profoundly dumb people can fill that void. Karine Jean-Pierre is the future, shoving stupidity into our faces forever. Most will be blithely unaware of the deception, too, recipient and sender alike.

        At the moment the relationship of the utterances of the US federal state to the truth are that they are the diametric opposite of the truth. If Kirby denies Ukraine involvement in the mass shooting in Moscow, you know that the US itself was complicit. If US media talks about the advances by Ukrainian forces, you know that the front is collapsing. If media and politicians talk about China going into deep recession, you know they’re projecting US decline onto China. If media and state talk about how safe and effective the vaccinations are, you know they’ll kill you. If Lindsey Graham shrilly brays for war against Iran, you know he’s prostituting himself for Israel. If Biden talks about a robust economy, you knows it’s in the toilet and and an increasing number of Americans can’t make ends meet. If Biden talks about strengthening the border, you know that his backers are actively financing and encouraging people to invade the USA.What I see is a completely dysfunctional US state fronted by people with IQs on the left side of the Bell Curve. And maybe this wouldn’t have been possible in quite the same way sixty years ago because of the different ethnic composition of the country and also because there were still some Anglos in the upper reaches of government.

            Here’s just one example of the endemic mendacity. The agitprop media will state as news a fact that while facially true so lacks in relevant context that it loses all significance. “Republicans in Congress are holding up $61 billion in money for Ukraine!” Such stories never answer questions such as do voters want to flush billions down the toilet of corruption in Kiev, but more importantly: what can you do with $61 billion? Because you can’t buy shells… they’re aren’t any left. And we can’t produce them fast enough to make a difference. And Russia produces at minimum six times per annum the quantity of shells the entire West can. Admitting that means you have to explain why Russia has only grown stronger economically and more independent despite every sanction imaginable. Germany and the UK are in recession, but Russia is having an investment boom and even Western outfits like the IMF and World Bank admit it. Kiev also is running out of men. It’s so bad the average age of frontline troops is 43.But no, in GAE it’s the same dog and pony show, red vs. blue and pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

        “All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus, now they don’t. They call us to explain to them what’s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.”– Ben RhodesThis was during the Obama Era, and Ben was not exactly the brightest bulb in the bunch, but he was a talented propagandist.

        It was all oven when President “It depends on what the definition of IS, is” and his wife “I don’t recall” were able to do this under oath and half the country thought this was oh-so-clever.
The constant on-the-fly redefining word definitions has made honest talk impossible.  (See: sex, vaccine, IQ, illegal, etc.)

Nobody thought it was clever, they just didn’t care because the economy was so good. Turns out, the character and morality of our leaders really does make a difference.

                        I wish I could take credit. Alas, those three poems, which work perfectly together en suite, were from a limerick competition the WaPo did back in the palmy Lewinsky days.

Better, see Matthew 4:5, something about someone’s dad.

            So old Marty the Kraut took his 30 pieces of silver, but found out his new friends were not so peachy. After turning on his old friends, found out they did not want him back.
What a conundrum.
End result: storefront churches with rainbow flags.
Looking up from his hell, old Marty tried to warn us … but it was too late.
Thanks old Marty.

        The worst part about Karine Jean-Pierre is that, while extremely dumb, I don’t think she is even the dumbest person in the that room.  The press is so stupid she might not even be in the bottom ten.  The younger generation especially, even if they didn’t see themselves as zealots for the cause are too dumb to adequately check the administration.
