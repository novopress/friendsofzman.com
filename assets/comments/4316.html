        Just because it’s an overseas story the modus operandi won’t change.The same “misreporting” is going on regarding black on white violence in the US, where every 12 hours a white person is killed by a black, a dozen white women are raped by blacks every day and even more whites are seriously beaten up. Statistically it’s safer for a white person to serve a tour of duty overseas, patrol the streets of Kabul, then it is to walk your dog in Philly.Yet the lame stream media is all white devil, all the time…The emperor’s new clothes meets The wolf who cried boy.
