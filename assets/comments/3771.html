            The Republic was dead long before Caesar. I blame Marius.
I have argued that it was doomed when the Roman ruling elite stopped enforcing their own codes, customs and rules. Once a ruling elite loses the capacity to police itself, the strong begin to exploit the weak, through any means necessary. The ability to reform is lost and instead it is about replacing rules with new rules and new rulers.

        Bush has the support of the elites who peddle third world crap out of Walmart and live like King Louis and Marie Antoinette. They already slew blue collar America and would be happy to give what jobs are left to Jose Santiago and Flaco Lopez for $ 8.00 an hour with no benefits but Obamacare, WIC coupons and an EBT card. As for the former working class give them heroin and meth, sports and porn and a disability check. It’s all good until it ain’t.

        Z, what’s your opinion on Scott Walker, Governor of Wisconsin?
… the only possible candidate without a college degree AND who attained the highest rank, eagle scout, in the scouts of America!

            I’m still waiting for Walker to ripen. I like the fact he has taken the best shots the Left can throw. The tidal wave of sewage they sent at him was unprecedented. The fact that he did not fold speaks well of him. It also suggests he has no illusions about what he is facing. That last part puts him on an island. All of the other GOP candidates think they can do business with the Cult.I’m willing to be patient with most of these guys. They are still thinking about their positions on a lot of these things. What’s encouraging about Walker is he has no illusions about being embraced by the beautiful people of his party. The national GOP abandoned the guy in his last election so he also knows he has a den of snakes in his own party. But, we’ll see. They all have a bad habit of evolving in the wrong direction.

        Bush may very well get nominated. The Bush name is like a politician in Louisiana with the surname “Long” – name recognition and a shitload of money goes a long, long way.
He may get the nomination, but he ain’t gettin’ my vote, primary or general.

            The Donor Party is lining up behind Jeb. They very clearly prefer him to all others, including Hillary. Rubio is their fall back guy. The NAABP certainly understands that Jeb may be too openly hostile to traditional Americans, despite his last name. So, they have Rubio warming up on the sidelines, just in case. Rubio also has the advantage of being a chocolate savior, which gives many on the Right a chubby. It’s the only reason Ben Carson, for example, is getting serious attention.
I’m not terribly optimistic about any of it.

        Miami bi cultural?  I spent 15 years there, in the 80’s – 90’s and wonder what two cultures he is talking about.  White/Cuban, White/Hatian, White/Negro, White/Jamaican, White/Vast array of South Americans.  Miami is many things but it is hardly an American city. White Americans have to duck and run unless I guess you are a Bush.

        If Jeb has a comp it is Hillary. They are both overrated in the sense that they appear inevitable to some, but they are not. Hillary couldn’t even beat a candidate who in truth was only running to move his name recognition up for a later run. Jeb burned all his good will with the right wing and is becoming outright loathed. Jeb and Christie are examples of politicians whose strategy is to be in position to poach a very significant portion of the Democrat vote from a far left wing Democrat candidate because they see the future as all left all the time. Watch what Sandoval is doing in Nevada.

        I cannot see a scenario where Jeb gets nominated, either.  The people are tired of Bushes.
I do totally agree, though, about bi-culturalism.  A person cannot be bi-cultural.  It’s impossible.  As you said, a person can appreciate another culture, but you can’t be both.

        Northeastern patricians hating America has been the case as long as there have been northeastern patricians and an America.
Going native usually happens with Asia. I can maybe, kind of see falling in love with some Latin cultures, but Mexico? Yuck.
I don’t think Jeb will even get nominated. The base has gotten screwed by two Bushes, and won’t put up with a third. W not only hosed Jeb, he hosed George Prescott.
