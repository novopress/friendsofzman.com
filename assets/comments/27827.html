        It occurs to oneself that Z could be one of those witty political stand-up guys.  Or easily write for them.   Remember that guy on PBS who’d sit at the piano and sing funny stuff.  Or that guy Spalding Gray?  Why can’t Z do that? Or maybe he does.Z: “That will lead to a public debate about what to do with the aging Joe Biden. Do they let him serve out his term or do they push him down a flight of stairs after the election?…The final fin in the water of Kamala Harris. Up until a few weeks ago, she was programmed to chant about how she looked forward to running with Biden in 2024 whenever asked about it. Someone swapped out her response code with a new response designed to give the impression she hopes Biden dies soon…On the other hand, the 2020 election says that anything is possible so Biden running and winning in 2024 is not unthinkable. The beautiful people love firsts so he can be the first man in a coma to win election. Maybe the first man with a single digit approval rating to win reelection. After all, he was the first man to lose the first four primaries and still win his party’s nomination. He also got eighty million votes in the general election, which says that in America anything is possible.”

        Awww, shucks!  I forgot the best part of Morning Joe!You see, Trump saw it all in his secret bunker, watching on video.  Some parts he rewound over and over, giggling with maniacal glee.  No, really!  Like, really for reals!But that was not the worst part.  You cannot begin to imagine how evil this madman truly was.The entire leadership of the United States was in that building!Pence, Pelosi, and…and…the nuclear football!You see?

        Z-Man, yes I see the press stuff as part of the Inner Party machinations, IMHO likely Hillary! who has power/influence over the media and security services. But China owns the current Regime via Son of Big Guy, and they will not let that ownership go. Everything from Green Industrial destruction to Green Energy shortages to CRT is inflicting their own Red Guard / Maoism destructiveness on their chief rival in the Pacific. Big Guy will be the nominee if they have anything to say about it, and considering they run much of Corporate America and the security services and media companies, they do.We are seeing elements of non-financial Oligarchs realize American Maoism is not conducive to Space X, Amazon, or Blue Origin even existing much less making money as real companies rely on energy, productive workforces, and a reliable and predictable supply chain to make money. Some elements of the Military Industrial complex are awakening to that as well.Newsom is likely to be as successful as Harris, Kloubichar, and Buttgig. California is riven by the black/Hispanic turf war. The latter pushing blacks out of neighborhoods and demanding first place in patronage. The mini-war between LA County Sheriff Alex Villaneuva (a Trump-lite character) over mask mandates, vaxx mandates, Latino Deputy gangs, and cleaning up Venice vs the Cuck/black coalition of the Board of Supervisors is California politics at its essential. Latinos make up most of the law enforcement officers, are not happy at all crime by blacks being legal, and in a fight against Newsom ally Gascon, LA County DA, over policies leading to cop killers pled out gang members let out to kill cops as in the El Monte Cops killed by one let out by Gascon in the local motel complex.Newsom as the black candidate who is not black is basically California’s Bill de Blasio. I expect Stacy Abrams or Mayor Groot to be the main challenger for Big Guy.

            So people know, Villanueva has refused to enforce mask mandates or force his deputies (mostly Latino) to be vaxxed. His deputies hate both. The Board is trying to fire him over that. He’s also wanting to arrest or force out the homeless in Venice, which the Board  also hates as each homeless person brings in about $250K to $500K in combined federal, state, local, and NGOistan grants (for grifting and grafting). He also has a big gang issue among deputies he denies exists, and various abuses in the County Jail. The LA County Board of Supervisors is mostly cucks and blacks and like the LA City Council notoriously corrupt.Villaneuva is not my guy nor an Angel but he at least fights his ethnic corner and that can no longer in a majority Latino state be covered up anymore. His groups main enemy is not Whites, now totally absent from most patronage or political issues, but blacks. THAT is the conflict roiling the Democratic Party. Latinos like big trucks, eating beef and chicken and pork not bugs, owning guns, dislike black crime being legalized, and so on. They also figure THEY not sacred worshiped blacks should be in most patronage positions. IMHO that conflict sinks Newsom. The state is in transition to being basically Northern Mexico in the US.

                The city council move to remove Villanueva as sheriff could potentially set a horrific legal precedent for the institution of the county sheriff nationwide.
As for the MIC, they’ve been all in on forced masking, forced jabs, CRT, and celebrating alphabet soup.
Meanwhile, my phone and email continues to light up with contacts from recruiters.

                    Hoo boy, lads.  That is damm near a picture perfect postcard of L.A. politics.
And now, Newsom is pushing the “make the gig economy, independent contractors, and owner operators illegal” button again.
These dipsticks really, really want to destroy  the supply chain and capture every small doctor, farmer, trucker or gig driver out there.  As goes Cali, so goes the nation.
Maybe the Chinese are having an unemployment problem and are about to come back over here.
Coolies and Cartel, let democracy ring!

            Not to go full bore NAHALT, but that aligns perfectly with what clients from SoCal have told me. Also, the Mestizos are pretty based on the J Question, which I guess shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Redpilling them to the fullest extent possible on that issue might pay dividends. Also, an attack on the gig economy is an attack on them, too.
I’m also quite bearish on the Newsome Question, but since I see voting as simply a tool to foment discord/force open Regime cheating at this point, it sort of is more entertaining than useful information.

        The Biden videos today from Israel remind me of the old series of comedy skits with Tim Conway, “Dorf Goes Fishing”. Instead it’s Biden walks on the Tarmac, Biden forgets which way is his chair, Biden…
Were we ever a serious nation with regards to leadership?

                “Sedevacantist” means that the  Chair of Peter (the Pope) is empty.But you may have already known that.The Chair of Peter is, of course, NOT empty. It is still occupied by Benedict XVI.Jorge is merely a globohomo interloper. And most definitely not a Catholic.🙂

        Well, it looks like they’ve reached the banks of the Rubicon. The Cloud People in the Government have pretty much decided he has to go, but how?Well, they could use his and his son’s corruption to drive Pedo Peter out of office, but that is too messy and people will hate Democrats even more.We can assume they’ll fill the envelopes full of cash and hand it to the Dominion People, but they still have Joe plus a population who will be even more angry over another crooked election. The Dirt people are already on the verge of getting too uppity anyhow.Or they could pull off an act where Joe and a few others they don’t like are out of the picture, and the American people are so shocked that they can declare martial law and get away with it. That way they can cancel the elections, go after their White Supremacist Bogeymen, and soothe the normies will a narrative like ” we’re doing this for your good.” And the saps will believe it. And the Republicans will all line up and shout “Yeah!”Now you all can try to figure out what they could do. You fill in the blanks. I would call it The Mother of All False Flags, but I don’t think I’m supposed to mention stuff like that around here. After all, there’s no Deep State. Right?Anyhow, think on this premise. What would they have done In the time of Imperial Rome?

        Come now, let’s give our Republican friends a little bit of credit — they will be amusing us to death as well. It’s going to be hilarious, watching them rig their primaries to keep Orange Man from winning again. And since DR3, they pretty much have to go with someone brown. I bet “Nikki” “Haley” is warming up in the bullpen as we speak, since she’s a twofer, but I bet Marco Rubio has one more run in him. Make foam parties great again! Or they might go for the quadruple axel and run that heretofore unknown scion of the Bush family, Jebuardo Bush. Fun times ahoy!

They’re going to make their voters vote for that steaming pile “Pierre Delecto”, aka “Mittens”, aka Romney, but with a POC &amp; POV (Person of Vajay-jay).
He’s so RINO the dems can stomach him, and normiecon can “own the dems” by voting for the one who “should’ve” beat Obama.

            One must be careful—lest “orange man” run as an independent and nail those duplicitous RINO’s to the wall.  That’s how Clinton got in.  Trump is in the drivers seat for 2024, like it or not.

The plan g=has to be for the Dems to deny anything is wrong until January when the OP, despite their best efforts will win.Part two of the Dems plan is to accelerate and exacerbate all of the evils and blame the GOP.

                        There should be a breakdown of those “illiterate” “kids” by race.  Although I don’t have my finger on the pulse, I know of no White friends nor family that kept their kids in a locked down school situation.
Here in my berg, I’m betting these illiterate kids would have been illiterate coming out of any school we offer and the breakdown would have been about the same by race as before Covid.  We already have something approaching 50% illiterate graduates from HS here in the Hispanic community.

        About the only thing I know for sure is that it is going to suck. I do enjoy the gyrations however. “Oh no, we really, really do like you that’s why we want your vote, now put your head in this oven.”
That’s the part that always gets me, people know they are going to get screwed yet they still expect good things. For example, after the presumed shellacking the republicans give in the mid-terms I know we’re all just dying to get “immigration reform” at long last. Any bets that they won’t try? It’s going to be grrreat.

        I don’t think you can rule out the GOP failing to take both the House and Senate and possibly on purpose.  They know all the problems ailing us are the result of long term secular problems that cannot be fixed with happy talk and a tax break for billionaires. Plus, the GOP loves being the powerless opposition.  They get to stick to their “principles” when it doesn’t matter. They can bitch about the budget deficit and the government being too large when they will be outvoted and the Democrat President will sign huge spending bills.  It’s great for fundraising.

            True, however, while Plato advocates for his philosopher-king, he states that they should have life experiences in lower offices (at least 15 years after 35 years of schooling and education). His definition of “true philosophers” is also someone that seeks knowledge and wisdom on all subjects. His famous allegory compared Athenian democracy to a group of people with no knowledge of navigation trying to take charge of a ship at sea. From this perspective, z’s comparison holds true. Todays leaders have no idea what it takes to keep power grids running or supply chains functional. They inherited these things and were then groomed to say simpleton rhetoric in front of an audience.

        Newsom is by far the most capable of all the pygmies running, but he has one big problem.  California depends on capital gains and income taxes to a bigger extent than anyone realizes.  It gyrates radically from flush budget at the height of stock and real estate bubbles to near ruin when those bubbles burst.  And sure enough, when the budgets are flush, they lock in expensive nonsense like healthcare for illegals.  It also has a very expensive pension plan for its blue haired state workers.  When the economy goes into reverse, all that bubble money going into the state budget vaporizes.  So instead of going into the Democrat primary crowing about how strong the CA economy is, it’ll be ground zero of the economic disaster about to unfold.  Even Democrats will pause to look at the smoldering ruin that is CA.

            A big problem for Newsom is that California was Lockdown Central during the plandemic.  Florida under DeSantis was the most open state.
By 2024, the immense number of deaths and injuries from the Covid “vaccines” (not vaccines) will be a problem for politicians who supported the vaxx and the mandates.

                It’s only an electoral problem for the left if normies know about it and normies only know about it if its reported and its only reported if its not an electoral problem for the left.
It won’t be a problem.  Has it been a problem so far that the virus was intentionqlly engineered in a US funded lab?
Scandal of the century would be far too mild if this was allowed to be widely understood
We need to accept the awful reality what total narrative control means.

                Wolf Barney: You’re forgetting who controls the megaphone. Mainstream media will simply ignore deaths and injuries from the “vaccines.” Alternative media will report on such matters, but the vast majority of those who read/watch alternative media will already be anti-vax to begin with. So alt media will mainly be preaching to the choir. Given the attention span of the average person, it’s entirely possible that most of the electorate will barely remember Covid by 2024.

                    Good points Wkathman.  It may not be enough, but the mainstream media has been rapidly losing credibility, and is now at an all-time low in terms of trust.  I believe it’ll go even lower.Also, we don’t know if the deaths and injuries will increase, and how much they’ll increase.  I think by quite a bit, too many to sweep under the rug.  Including children, which will make parents enraged.  But I might be wrong.Insurance companies, which are aready reporting massive increases in deaths since the vaxx rollout, might not stay quiet on this.  But then maybe the government pays them to offset their losses.I’m already amazed at how much a large number of my neighbors know regarding the deaths and injuries, and how eerily quiet my pro-vaxx friends and neighbors are.

        It’s right to concentrate on which Democrat wins, because the Republicans are a finished party and a finished brand.  The Democrats never want to relinquish power, but being in the minority in Congress will be a hefty consolation prize this year, as the economy implodes.  It’s not coming back for years.  Should the Republicans win, suddenly THEY will be the ones holding up PPP check, round 2, and Stimmy round 2, and as everyone gets their autos repossessed because they were thrown out of work, a giant arrow will be pointed by all the Dems and all the media at these uncaring Republicans who will be turned into Monopoly guy with monocle (who also denied your precious abortion in a country chok-full-o-sluts and hoes   This will create a positive tailwind again for the Democrats.The Republicans will be rightly frightened that the fiscal picture of the U.S. is crumbling along with the economy.  But the time for fiscal restraint is long passed.  It’s not politically practical, nor does it matter for a pyramiding Federal budget that’s already out of control just as the recession is beginning.  The suicide of that part will be at hand, and good riddance.

        By 2024 there may be a reckoning with the vaccines.
Perhaps the strategy will be to allow Trump to get back into office.  Then the dam of denial bursts and they unload all the blame on Mr. Warp Speed.

Yet, not even the puppets of those in charge ever have to worry about such a fate. Remember the “Lock Her Up!” slogan that Trumpists use to chant with regard to Hillary Clinton? How’d that turn out?

                This is why I have zero optimism for America surviving.  It’s over and it’s never coming back.  I plan to leave the country once I am able to retire.  There is no saving it.  It will become a black and brown 3rd world nation in my lifetime, filled with poverty, drug addiction, trans gender mutants and feral negros running rampant doing what they do (stealing, raping, murdering, etc.).If I had a single wish I would wish for the leftists to get their just desserts.  Some sort of horrific torture before finally ending their miserable lives.  However, I know that won’t ever happen, and this hell hole will just continue to decline and become more and more of a shit hole.  In order for people to stand up for America, you need to have actual Americans.  There simply aren’t enough left.This is reality.  There will be no great revolution that takes the country back or straightens things out.  It is over.  The country you once knew is long gone for good.

                    What you say is true. And certainly, there won’t be a revolution. But as AINO’s power decays–and it will–I believe certain parts of the country will secede, and that they will create societies infinitely superior to the one in which we presently suffer. Ejecting the Hutus will be the first order of business for those breakaway polities.

There won’t be for sure.  But I am cynical enough to believe that they will use Trump as a whipping boy for the vaccines if he is elected again.  All the while absolving themselves of any responsibility.

                    Trump never required the vaccine to remain employed. Blue States have, the military under Biden has, businesses with more than 100 employees has and the democrat politicians who are in control did nothing to stop it. Even my democrat and leftist co-workers can’t deny that.

        I was convinced the GOP would become the white party, but that’s not happening. It’s becoming the Dems of not so long ago. Duh! Meanwhile, educated whites are going Dem, I read. Yesterday’s bourgeois conservatives are today’s bourgeois radicals, or radical is the new conservative, who knows. It gives me a headache.
Here in PA, Dems seem to be banking on the suburban Karen and cuck vote. All Roe. Mastriano and Oz(!) are too extreme for PA.

        Perhaps the Democrats don’t care about diversity accept when appointing the cabinet and the judiciary. The judicial appointments and approvals since ’20 are truly astounding using diversity to be beyond reproach and provide cover for lethally toxic, ideological insanity. The residue of this will be around for decades. It means we can’t vote or litigate our way out of this now.I caught a bit of Hawley interrogating a UC Berkeley professor in a Congressional hearing. The hostility and brazen disregard that feral chair warmer displayed was remarkable. You should watch it to get a glimpse of where this is headed. Of course Hawley made the rounds afterward on Hannity. He was gloating that these people are crazy and that is the modern Democrat thinking he won something. He looked like he was acting as mission accomplished. Yet, he and Hannity implicitly validated the idea that words are violence in so doing. More ground given while declaring victory.These fools can’t seem to put on the pants. That that abomination is a college professor at an elite university and then brought into the US Congress as an expert witness to assert that men can have abortions while acting with hostile contempt toward two US Senators is a warning to us all. Take away the stinking money. Taxpayers pay for this rot. I guess that is too easy of a solution.That person’s attitude and outlook is enshrined throughout the federal judiciary now. This is topical to elections. The Democrats may or may not give “diversity” a chance at the top of the ticket, but what they have done with appointments once they get elected is a frightening proposition. Blacks as a whole are extremely opposed to homosexuality and all of its deviations. But, their political militants are using tranny-ism to breach the Cathedral. Election by election, appointment by appointment, he Bolsheviks march on.

            I think a victory would have looked like this:“I see that you can’t understand that speech is not violence. I see that you state that a person who states the scientific fact that men cannot get pregnant is violence. How you passed the third grade with that misunderstanding of fundamental facts and concepts of reality is beyond me. That you are a professor at one of the world’s elite Universities is a tragedy of epoch proportions. It speaks to a level of degeneracy and decay that our civilization cannot and will not tolerate.I thank you for your time and I thank you for coming here today as a display of the rot and decay at UC Berkeley’s faculty. I have no further questions. I propose and strongly urge my colleagues  to schedule Congressional hearings to abolish the taxpayer funded rot, degeneracy and outright lunacy that our last witness brought to light today. Let us hold hearings and show the American taxpayer what they are paying for and bring this to a swift end by defunding it immediately. I will also serve the regents of UC Berkeley with a notice of the intellectual bankruptcy of some of their faculty and of the abysmal manner in which they comport themselves in front of the People’s United States Senate.”Slam the gavel and have an aide start the process. Next!That would be Hawley acting like a serious American man.

                PeriheliusLux:  The only rational response, had Hawley the balls, would have been to laugh in her face.

                    He did laugh in her face. Perhaps that is the best approach. I am of the mind that harsh repudiation, especially in the Chambers of our most sanctified institutions is the proper order. I may well be wrong.

                    3g4me:No offense taken. We need robust conversations. We have an enemy that is very organized and very powerful. We must be very careful not to be rash.I feel the anger that you do. Believe me. However, I was watching a report on the Sri Lankan revolution yesterday. Funny enough, the Black Power fist was emblazened the flag held by a revolutionary who had taken over the state run TV. Why an American revolutionary symbol? How did they get to control the TV station?That same fist is printed on “experimental” UBI programs that are given exclusively to black women in Mississippi and I believe Georgia. It is the same symbol erected on St George of the Holy Overdose’s shrine.We act rashly and throw out our institutions at our peril. This is a massive psy op and a long war. One way to operate is to be enraged and throw everything out. Are we organized and prepared enough to step in to that void? What do we say about ourselves and our people and our history when we do that? What does history tell us about that approach? Another approach is to feel the anger, be justified in it, but to be rash and to organize and to take the courses of action that increase our standing in the eyes of all around us. We need standing. If we are what we say we are we will earn it.A time may well arise where we have won an advantage that we can press to banish the revolutionaries and send an unequivocal message. I suspect that time is in the future. In the meantime we must think like Caesar. He conquered Gaul, but every mood he made was tactical in his greater plan to return to Rome. Every trial he and his men faced was far greater than any we have so far. Yet they remained cool headed and confident. If Caesar had laid seige to Rome there would have been nothing to return to and attempt to fix.We must control our emotions, no matter the provocations thrown our way. Carpe Diem!

                        What can you really do with the left having control of every institution in the country?  All of corporate America is controlled by the woke left as well.  The left has won the culture war.  There is nothing to fight, the war is already over.  The time to have organized is long past.  Asking people to give up what little they have left only to lose is not a realistic solution.  Maybe there isn’t a solution and this is the destiny of our society.  Remember, this isn’t just an American phenomenon, the cancer has spread throughout the world.  Europeans were chanting for justice for St. George Floyd.  We now have statues and murals of black thugs.  GW statues are being torn down.  This is a rotten country now, and it is not a country for white men any longer.

The problem with this statement is loosing one’s temper is not what the right ever does.
The vice of the right is total passivity, so statements like this just contribute to the vice, and I have been increasingly suspicious of the people who make them.
Some lost tempers a while back could have stopped many of our problems in its tracks before they go so big.

                        Exactly. And I’ll tell you this–if all of these so-called “conservatives” who have donated literally billions of dollars to college sportsball over the last several decades had instead used that money to build parallel institutions, AINO would still be America. But these rich “conservatives” are so small-minded and myopic it’s incredible. Fuck ’em. Frankly, they deserve to smoked in their own BBQ pits by the very savages they’ve lionized and abetted.

                Harley was expecting a subservient testifier.  He expected her to sit there and take a beating.  He was maneuvering to embarrass her and exploit her and turn her ideology against her for *his* political gain.  He was caught short when she attacked first.  She was faster and smarter than he.  To that I credit her strategy.
Hell, I even got upset that a commoner was attacking a Senator, where’s our vaunted decorum of the Congress, but then I caught myself…old thinking.  Then I reminded myself—whoever wins, you lose…new thinking.

        Prognostication Alert!Yes, the RINO wave will arrive in November and be seated the following January. Stagflation, RONA 2.0, Hunter scandal #732, and the newly enacted Build Back Better Boondoggle (4Bs) will all converge to put everyone into a novel state of rage-whining and apoplexy. And the solution to all our problems will become . . . faux House hearings and RINOs peacocking in front of the TV cameras every minute of every day while vomiting bucks of indignation and scorn to appease the plebs. They might even throw in an impeachment or two to keep the ratings up and distract everyone from $10/gal gasoline. And the Caucasian birthrate will plunge even lower because Joe Normie will have ejaculated so hard on Nov 8th that not even Viagra can give him a stiffy again. Bongino and Carlson will be singing “Happy Days Are Here Again” and telling everyone that VOTE HARDER was a great success and the bane of election fraud is now kaput. Biden will die in his sleep and be covertly stuffed by a well paid taxidermist, but no one will notice, so he remains in office until 2024. Kamala will cackle her way to winning the nomination but then lose to Trump by a handful of fake votes. And Trump will then sell off the US to China for a nice profit and return to Mar a Lago. Just sayin’.

        If Kamala was serious, she’d switch to Republican and pick Hershel Walker as her running mate.
The neocons would spend more money on her to keep Trump out than they’ve spent on Zelenskyyyy.
Grillercons would orgasm so hard they could barely walk.
The Woke, enraged at not being able to chant “Trump” every half-minute like a psycho parrot (or girlfriend), would burn another 500 cities down.

            Kamala’s proven to be possibly a bigger embarrassment than Biden, who at least has old age as an excuse.
Kamala’s speaking style with that creaky vocal fry, interspersed too frequently with nervous laughter, and repetition of certain phrases and her general inability to get her point across, disqualifies her for high office going forward.
It was a colossal mistake to appoint her, especially since the Dem primary elections, both in her vote total and watching her in the debates, revealed how unappealing she is.

                Kamala can’t “make her point” because she has no point. Really.  Listening to her is “amusingly” similar to listening to those comedian “double talkers” who were popular many years ago on the talk show circuit.  They’d talk and talk and when you put their words together said nothing of meaning and never addressed the question/topic that started their whole discussion off—but they made it sound like they were on point, and you were deficient in some cognitive way.Harris does this naturally seemingly without thought or effort.  One is left thinking that “the lights are on but nobody’s home.”  Here’s the scary part: As I’ve discussed before, I have a close relative in the later stage of early onset dementia.  In the last year, she has been talking to herself, *exactly* like Harris in an interview!  Talk without meaning.  Only with us, we laugh and continue on with her as if we understood what she is saying, but there’s nobody home…

        Dems will run Newsom/Whitmer Pres/VP. Money talks. The Silicon Valley and private equity crowd are losing money in the market and tired of all the mismanagement and BS. It takes hundreds of millions $ to run a campaign and Newsom is the only backable horse in the race now. The money people are pragmatists; they want to win (win legitimately; obviously, if they have to, they will put the fix in again), they want control and they want baseline competence.The Hunter Biden “leaks” are obviously a “shot across the bow”. It’s the insiders’ way way of telling Dr Jill and team to back off and give up without a fight.

            David Wright:  Excellent comparison.  I do think politics seems to be something too many people – even heading our way in so many areas – cannot let go of.  Because to truly and utterly accept it’s all theatre and a waste of time means you have to DO something.  And there’s very little anyone can do, except look for himself and his family and friends and try to find some sort of refuge from the coming storm.  It’s so much easier and more comforting to think that this school board seat, or that senate primary, will begin to make a difference.As I’ve said so many times before, I think it’s all a waste of time and have yet to regret calling and having my name removed from the voter rolls.  I wish more would do the same.  Then sitting it all out cannot be misinterpreted.

        Floridian here.  Unlike Newsome’s California we have driveable roads, decent schools, First and Second Amendment rights, a minimal problem with homelessness, clean beaches, rare forest fires, plenty of water, uninterrupted electricity (except in the case of hurricanes), and no drag queens grooming our children.  I’m staying.

His propensity for self-importance and resolute commitment to thinking his whispers and mic drops “clear the room” will only be erased by an incident—he will never retire, nor will Jill stand by and let them push him out willingly.

                        That’s precisely why the AP style manual, supposedly used by all MSM outlets, states that the title “Dr.” only be used to describe individuals who possess a certified *medical* degree!Of course that began falling by the wayside with *Dr* Martin Luther King and is most often today ignored in the required fawning over minorities with weak credentials/backgrounds.  But even in academia, it wasn’t too long ago that addressing oneself as “Doctor”—when you have a PhD rather than an MD—was considered egotistical and in poor form.  Hell, we used to laugh at the Med School folk who persistently introduced themselves as “doctor” so and so—outside of a medical interaction.

            Good point on the role of [Dr.] Jill Biden.  She has no intention of going quietly back to Wilmington to watch Joe drool in the corner.  Expect her to be seeking to find skeletons in every potential challenger’s closet and to be adroit and ruthless in the timing of making them public.  She has almost nothing to lose.

                The Reverend Dr Jill L. Biden Junior is a baby sitter who sucked her way to the white house, she mighr have ambition but she has none of the ability necessary to accomplish any grandiose plan.  She’s got a big mouth but not big enough for every man in America to fit in at once.  Plus she’s too old to entice potential johns.  Same reason kamala is topping out now, call it the glass headboard.

            Dr. Jill will likely get maneuvered into a position where she does not have a choice.  The Biden family finances are a target rich environment, plus they can threaten to arrest Hunter which I don’t think Joe would stand for.  She is also pretty dumb as anyone who skimmed her doctoral work can attest.  I wouldn’t assume she has the ability to hold off the wolves trying to force Joe out.

                If she has an EdD, then she probably even escaped without a Dissertation.  Her work would entail only classes taken and passed.  Original research would not be available to examine.  This is one reason such a degree is looked down upon—even in academia.  It’s sole purpose is to fool the rubes.

            That Jill Biden would give a public speech confirming the ludicrous trope that multiculturalism mainly means diverse dining options show her lack of political acumen.
I’ll bet the good Doctor has paid plenty of Mexicans under the table for years for unskilled labor, but hasn’t had a taco (it’s prole food, people) in decades.
OT: not seeing any push for “Impossible Tacos” out there..,because Mexicans aren’t that stupid.

        “The people around Biden had him select Harris as a form of life insurance policy. Just as no one would take out Obama with Biden as VP, no one is going to take out Biden with Harris as VP.”
You may wish to meditate further on the internal contradictions here before resting this claim. If the “life insurance” is good enough to be the next candidate, what kind of insurance is that?

            It’s just another sign of the downhill slope we’re on.  Arguably, at least at the time, Clinton’s VP was better than he was.  Later, the story was that W chose Dr. Evil for VP because he wanted to give his administration gravitas (and arguably it probably wouldn’t have mattered if either one was president of that administration).  Then we have Obama choosing the worst contender for the job, a candidate so awful that it took several attempts at rigging just to get him on the ballot for his presidential run.  Biden in turn does the same thing Obama did.It’s the third world dictator mode where the “second in command” is someone with no power base and/or from a hated ethnic group.

        I’m going out on a limb and betting on Hillary Clinton for the run and the win in 2024. She’s crawling out from the filthy rock under which she’s been hiding. She’ll reluctantly agree to enter the Democrat primary and will win in a rigged contest.
Republicans will throw the election by fixing their primary so a “moderate” neocon type wins, like a Pompeo or maybe even Pence. Trump voters will sit out the election en masse, resulting in the lowest turnout election in decades for team Red. Hillary wins 300+ electoral votes with fewer than 70MM popular votes.

                    They can probably tilt it so far that it may as well be completely rigged but they do seem to want to get it close enough to preserve plausible deniability for legitimacy or even nostalgia.  Biden was probably just a bit farther over that line than they would have preferred to step.

            I’ve got young leftists in my family. 🙁 They are stampeding sheep like their shriveled predecessors. However, I have noticed that they have been programmed at college to say “eat the rich” and “no Hillary Clinton.”This is not a high vote turnout demographic, but it is a warning sign that perhaps the post-marxian faction of the Democrat Party has had quite enough of the Democrat-flavored crony corporatist faction. If I believed that anyone other than Dominion’s investors decided who wins elections, I would say that these people seem to be able to be reprogrammed overnight, so who can tell what the state of play will be at the moment of decision. We can at least say that the oppressed corrupt white multimillionaire vagina grift doesn’t have its historical traction.

                That is a good point.  The Inner Party will probably face their own “Trump Issue” the next prez primary where a famous hard leftist (unlike the right, there is no shortage of those on the left) will tilt the polls so badly that even the overt cheating from 2020 won’t be enough.
Meanwhile the hard gatekeeping from the GOP will probably make a third party run inevitable.

            I’ve had similar thoughts.  Hillary could run on a promise to serve only one term as a “Democratic unification” candidate.  But I think that she’d have to have a black or at least Hispanic running mate and the pickings are slim.

                My suspicion all along was they probably inflated trump’s votes tooThey probably figured trump would legitimately get 70 million votes but they weren’t sure so had to make sure they had a large enough buffer with Biden so he wouldn’t lose.   But saying Biden got 80 million votes would be a hard sell — unless the election was so amazingly historic that trump himself got historic vote totals.So they had to inflate trump votes just enough as the day progressed to keep it believable while also ensuring there was no way for Biden to loseEither way the election was a complete sham

                    It still would make more sense to just go with Trump’s actual tally, and pad Biden’s with just enough fake ballots to win.  My hunch is that most of the magical Biden votes came from the corrupt California system, where they pad the popular vote with illegals and every other means, to support the repeal of the electoral college.  They only needed a few hundred thousand fake ballots in three states to actually win.

And for Biden to swamp obama’s vote total by over 15mm is farcical
Like I say, the whole thing was a sham

                        Falcone, good point.  I also recall claims that Biden got more black votes than Obama, but also Trump got a higher percentage of the black vote in 2020 vs 2016.  There are a lot of circles that can’t be squared.

                        The difference in AZ between Trump and Biden was a little more than 10k votes.  More than enough fraud has been discovered to have created such a margin.Indeed, in one county down south here, the ballot stuffer caught on camera confessed and plead guilty.  I believe the person was a former Dem major of a small border town. Our Attorney General came down and whitewashed the whole thing by offering a plea deal of a low felony which could/would result in fine and probation—rather than sweating the purp to name names and expand the investigation to others.Those others were caught on camera and tied to unmonitored ballet drop boxes via phone records.  The accusation is that there are over 200 such “suspects” here in AZ alone.

            Hilary couldn’t even beat Trump. She’s unelectable. She’s got DECADES worth of political baggage, is a detestable human being, and has the charisma of a rattlesnake. Run any “acceptable” (R) against her, and she’d be lucky to win 20 states.
That said, the (D) election-stealing machine really learned how to get it done in 2020, so they just might be able to drag her poisonous hide across the line in 2024.

        If I were more naive, I would say that Americans saw how nasty Whitmer’s lockdown was and want none of it… but she’s probably going to  get reelected by the very people who were negatively affected by that lockdown, so I’m not going to get my hopes up that more than half of the rest of the country would reject her.
It’s very difficult to live amicably with “neighbors” who prefer tribal allegiance over horribly shitty politicians who should be in jail for crimes against humanity.

        Something I saw speculated on recently that in any other time would have immediately dismissed as “absurd political conspiracy theory”.  Biden gets “Kennedy’d”.  There is a certain horrible logic to it and Lord knows the people in charge are craven enough.  Solves several problems.  Gets him out of office.  Gives The Party a bloody shirt to wave.  Allows for a massive crackdown on firearms, anybody that looks vaguely right wing and dwarfs any other issues in the election.  I’m sure some handlers at the FBI are frantically spinning Rolodexes of candidates now.

I mean, best of luck to them, of course.

                Agree.  But that would even consider it a non-zero probability is testament to the utter weirdness of the 2000s.  These are people that think nothing of burning down whole parts of cities or daring the Russkies to nuclear war.  But yes they are stupid and that’s the problem. Stupid people think in the moment.

        I don’t see why the Dems should worry. If they fail to rig the election and the moderate Dems (the Pubs) take over, so what.There may be some concern about needing to keep the people happy election-wise but I don’t know why there should be.I’m a conspiracy theorist. I think our rulers, at home and abroad, realize that this is going to be the pan-Asian century and that America, hansomely endowed in natural resources, will be a satellite ripe for the plunder.The ruling class, following the Bidens, may bid to be America’s resident managers much like the Bosnian Muslims managed the Dalmation coast when the Ottoman Turks took over following the fall Venice and the defeat of the Serbs at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Sadly, centuries later, the Bosnial Muslims, fully integrated into Yugoslavia and Slavs themselves, paid the price of their ancestors’ derelection.We may not have to wait seven hundred years for history, allowing for context, to replay one of its modern Western hits.

            The only thing that keeps me voting really is the Supreme Court.  Roe was a nice overturn due to what a terrible ruling it was, but 70% of abortions are in blue states, so not much actual change.  However, if Hillary had won, the court would be 7-2 liberal, with the 2 conservatives being the oldest members.  The second amendment would be gone.  Every restriction on gun ownership would be upheld.  That’s not a small thing.

        Whitmer is nothing but a nasty, younger version of HRC – even kind of looks like her. The only reason anyone outside of Michigan has heard of her was the covid scamdemic where she acted the tough girl dictator role to a “T”.  Newsome is a smarmy little s***.  He may have some quasi “business” experience, but his California political life proves he couldn’t give two craps about the state’s businesses or working people.  Screw ‘em both along with cameltoe.

                        Trump supporters live in an alternate reality.  They still think he was the best president in history.  If you go to places like Freerepublic, they will viscously attack anyone who suggests nominating anyone else as if Trump is entitled to the nomination.

                        Last nite Tucker got a laugh out of Biden misinterpreting a recent poll saying “92 % of democrats support me”. The poll actually said 92% of dems would vote for Biden against Trump in 2024.  Think about that – in spite of how much damage has been done since Jan 2021, 92% of dems prefer continuing down the Biden toilet, just so long as it’s NOT Trump in the WH. Pure spiteful culture war reasoning (but reality) and Biden would love nothing better than “winning” against Trump – again. Imagine how sweet the victory against middle America!Trump’s become a liability to us now – the king of Lost Opportunity. He served his purpose (until he refused to deliver) and, worst of all, proved he has zero loyalty. In other words, he’s the thing he despises most – a Loser.

                I’m not so sure.  Problem with all these CA pols is they’ve come up in a an “appointment” system and rarely have to compete for spots unless its a “blue on blue” primary race.  Newsom has always gotten to spew his empty suit nonsense to adoring audiences that never ask tough questions.  OTH they elected an Alzheimers patient as President….

                    That is something that cannot be ignored. Thirty years ago there was some value in taking down a pol, regardless of party. The media is monolithic now and anyone asking the wrong questions of the wrong candidate risks expulsion. That was a lesson of 2020. They knew Biden was a vegetable, but no one dared say it. In 2024, the Dems could run a spree killer and any mention of it will be called a conspiracy theory. Just look at the Ray Epps story. The guy is literally in video telling people to sack the Capitol. Mentioning it is a conspiracy theory.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/jan-6-ray-epps-evidence.html

                And unlike Trump, Newsome has Presidential hair. That matters as much as anything else at this point. Especially to the latinos. Newsome already looks like he could be running any of the South American narco states. He was selected long ago. Embrace the hair, it’s the future.

                    There has long been a theory that the winning candidate is the one most people would prefer to have a beer with.  Since suburban white women don’t drink beer, I would amend the formula to add the variable of: the candidate suburban white women can fantasize about being their white knight.  So yeah, Newsom’s hair will be our next president.

                The bid negative I see with Newsom is that most Americans have soured on California and have a negative view of the state.  They don’t want what California elites have brought to their state implemented for the whole country.  The only people moving there now are carny trash hoping to make it in the entertainment industry.  Millions have left and they have replaced them with third worlders.  Maybe they are dumb enough to vote for Newsom in their new states, but I doubt it.

                    I am not sure it really matters what voters think. If the system can add 5-10% more votes in critical states when needed, elections no longer really matters. The only counter to systemic ballot stuffing is a massive shift in voter sentiment. Maybe that happens. To college educated whites, Newson will sound like a reasonable alternative to the crude and old Donald Trump.

                        Outside of CA and NY, most states see California as a disaster with nice weather. Having controlled CA during its decline, Newsom will somehow have to dodge the charge he will Californicate the rest of the country.  Maybe that gets enough to insulate against the fraud factor.

                        That’s precisely the problem.  Not that a 5% shift in the ballots can fraudulently decide elections, but that such can be easily preventable.  However, Rep’s will not do so in tossup states.  Here in AZ where the evidence of a corrupt process is apparent, no substantive change has been voted in.In my Dem controlled County they even did away with precent voting in favor fewer Countywide polling stations where anyone can vote and where they print off ballots via printer as the need arises. They don’t even need to account for ballot numbers anymore!What could go wrong with that?  A corrupt process has been made even more corrupt and open to even easier fraud.

        Whitmer was one of the most odious human beings on the face of the earth.  One just has to look at one of her press conferences to just feel the vile evil emanating from every pore in her body.  She makes Hillary look likable.  An the people she put in positions of power are somehow worse.  Go ahead and do an Early Life check on Michigan AG Nessel and be prepared to not be surprised.She also got a big black eye with her Covid overreach, to the point she had to back way off because she was starting to get on very shaky ground with prospects for reelection and outright citizen rebellion.  Of course, the FBI arrested one of her main opponents in the next election, which shows the next stage of the political game.A lot of the persona revolves around things like wearing leather jackets public in appearances, the Big Gretch meme, and other kitchy things that come across okay at the state level, but weird in the federal show.  It’s all too fake for even Washington.

            The polling for Whitmer’s reelection numbers has been comically high.  They have her beating all potential challengers by double digits and polling over 50%.  It doesn’t seem like they are even trying to fake this one in a believable way.

                    She’s kind of MILFy in a Bride-of-Frankenstein way, so she’s got that going for her. I mean, I don’t know if I would hit on her in the grocery store, but she could certainly shoplift my morning wood and I wouldn’t complain.

            Eventually the people of Michigan managed to prompt the state legislature and judiciary to get a lot of Whitmer’s emergency coof powers canceled.
That may be a moot point this autumn since the Marxists are clearly going for broke.

                Pritzker is too ridiculous to take seriously, even in this age, which is saying something. Then again, never say never.Clinton seems to be done. The pattern with her has been that she runs when she thinks the game is rigged in her favor. They killed JFK Jr. so she could get a senate seat. Then she ran in 2008 assuming Obama was an empty suit. In 2016 the path was cleared so she could run largely unopposed. In 2024, there will be a packed field. That and she is a two time loser who will be pushing 80. With Biden’s age being an issue, the regime will want a younger person to face Trump in 2024 so they can call him too old.

                    I also think the Obama people are more than ready for the Clintons to go away.  Look at the way they didn’t pull out all the stops to save Terry McAuliffe in Virginia last year.  A lot of people even in the party hate the Clintons.

                        In the Democrat Cosa Nostra the past couple of years has seen seen regime media run concerted attacks on 3 of their crime families. In two out the three by the method they do best: no coverage at all. The Sanders Socialists are done, No successor in the offing. Clinton’s only media coverage has been  quirky items of interest, no serious coverage. Biden’s now getting the vicious venom of the professional haters. Obama’s  been running a lot more the Dems than he gets credit for and he will be the decider in 2024.Who will he choose?

        Joe Biden has done exactly what he was installed to do: make fuel costs unaffordable, start a hot war with Russia, deprive Americans of their basic human rights and civil liberties, oppress and harass White people to the point of genocide, and most of all to further enrich the Clouds, his family, and his friends. Viewed from that perspective, Biden has been a smashing success.If Joe Biden has accomplished the goals of those who stole the election and put a compliant vegetable into the Oval Office, he will be shuffled off to the sanitarium. Think “throw down president,” like the guns cops keep on them to plant on people they murder.If Joe Biden has not accomplished everything on his installers’ wish list, the election will be rigged again while he hides in another basement. The propaganda organs will notice a new pep in his step, and the loyal controlled opposition will announce new ways to work with the puppet.The United States, y’all.

            Indeed. If they were smart, they would allow for a sliver of legitimacy in 2022/4 and turn the gas pumps back to $3.75/gallon. That’s all it would take for another generation of White men to sit on their thumbs while the boomers shuffle off still having a few of their nice things and the whole melting pot turns brown beyond recognition.Normiecons could celebrate the this is how the System works! Civnats could show a win for the Constitution and muh diversity natural conservative votes.And the rest of the sheeples could snack on the crumbs of 2019 new normal while their hearts slowly swell to SADS and the NFL pretends that the great kneeling never happened as the rainbow forms over soldier field, cue the black anthem.By the time the next conservative sellout, crisis, war, constitutional diaper full of feces comes around the transition will be complete.

They’re not really the types to bottle up their worst urges even for a tactical advantage if they think that they can go unchallenged.

                    It’s not at all unavoidable, deportations can happen and citizenship and/or the franchise revoked.  Its all impossible in the current regime of course but pretty much everything is.  Dont accept all this as a irresistible of life, that’s unintentionally buying their narrative.

                That’s the great thing about the market. You can make money betting in either direction, providing you know which direction its going. Plus, there’s always the money that we’re told is going to Ukraine but will wind up in his “backers&#x27;” pockets.

                The simple secret is called “options”.  You don’t actually own anything or take delivery…on paper.The other is CAFR “public portfolio investment management.” Your shell companies are proxies, portfolio advisors walk you through the paperwork of what they have on offer.Family and charitable unit trusts are too.  You don’t “own” anything, but have 100% management control.Just imagine the 1001 tricks a rube like me never heard of. As Goldman says, “it’s Egyptian generals all the way down.”  (The military generals own everything valuable in Egypt- factories, ports, warehouses, businesses, rights, apartment blocks, everything.)  Congress, by proxy shells, are 535 oligarchs who own a large chunk of 75% of the listed corporations.  Patricians of the New England aristocratic class.12% yearly average, my azz.Congressionals have 15 to 20 of these deals sitting on their desk every week.  And a ghostwritten book advance if you need some quick cash, or unused campaign coffers to leverage against.Even Jen Psaki scored a couple million in 2 years on $183k annual salary.  Of course, I’d still nail that even if she wasn’t rich.  My kind of  cray-cray, don’t be jelly!

        it’s kind of funny but it doesn’t look like biden gets to enjoy his ill gotten gains much.   he doesn’t live in a particularly lavish way, and he won’t be around much longer either.   and that doesn’t even begin to address how his advanced dementia limits his ability to spend his graft.   same goes for the clintons.   i wonder why this is; maybe they are incapable of anything but feeding their ambition??
