        Don’t feel bad about sounding indifferent when it comes to sexual assault.  Progressives look the other way when it comes to interracial rape in Europe and even encourage the women not to pursue it any further because it might impugn the dignity of the noble Muslim.  In a more civilized society, sexual assault absolutely should be taken very seriously but now it’s just part and parcel of a multicultural society.

            I will tell you who does get raped:— every muslim girl, by a family member— every black girl, by her family and friends, and so on— every mexican girl, by a family member
Talk to a back woman on a personal basis, and you will be horrified at what has happened to them.

                I’ve known black women who would only date white men, or else remain celibate. Maybe this is one reason why.

            Yeah, if the left really cared about women as such, it would have gone ballistic about the Muslim-on-white rapes in Europe, as well as Muslim-on-Muslim, black-on-black, and Hispanic-on-Hispanic rapes.What does that tell me? That it’s not about gender, it’s about race. Look at the SCOTUS fiasco. Kavanaugh was white, so he had to be taken down. Sure, Blasey Ford was white, too, but her handlers, and media shills, and financial backers…And look at the reaction to the confirmation: an absolute outpouring of hatred for white people, including white WOMEN. It was all about race all along. In fact, I hope that the other side KEEPS spewing bile towards white women, to help more of them wake up.White women are the main battlefront in the identity politics war.

                That it’s not about gender, it’s about race.No it’s about power and that’s it… It’s about having the ability to force you to do what they want because force is the only way you can implement suicidal and insane policies…The question is and always has been when will we wake up and start coalescing so we have the power to have Liberty…

                    I don’t think we’re disagreeing. Indeed, it *is* all about power. I was just saying that some battles for power that are presented as breaking along gender lines, actually break more along racial lines.

                    Yep it boils down to power and the ability to force their agenda  on the rest of us at gun point or under the cover of judicial fatwas.
We caught a glimpse of that with the BK hearings. With their masks off the Democratic pols would be right at home running a dictatorship, others shipping whites off to a quarry for execution.

I would say no sane individual would think he could stand against that power but yet you don’t see many of the Right advocating to be forming up, training, and implementing policies favorable to us…We just put it on Trump to save us and then cry and complain when he doesn’t do exactly what we think he should…Sad That…

                You are correct.
Justice Kavanaugh (up yours, lefties) is white.  Many of the people leading the charge against him were a different kind of (((white))).
It’s a race war against whites.  It’s about shoving whities face in the mud.
First they came for the white men, then the white women, etc.

        I’m glad you wrote this one.For the whole Boozy-Ford testimony at the show trial I have been screaming at the idiot box; “SURVIVOR OF WHAT?!?!?!” For fuck’s sake, the whole basis of the accusation was pure weapons grade bullshit. “He was drunk, I was drunk, he felt me up through my clothes, he LAUGHED at me!, I ran away. I have NEVER recovered from the unbearable trauma.”Exactly on par with surviving the Cambodian killing fields.I spent the week wanting to punch the delusions out of every crazy cat lady I encountered, right in the middle of the Whole Foods box-wine and cat litter isle, as an example for the rest. I was quite literally filled with rage over the whole thing. Probably because my ex-wife was raped, beaten and left for dead   by a group of feral blacks, never identified, caught or prosecuted way back when I was in my 20’s. She was quite literally, never the same. This whole parade of nonsense really is a raging insult to any actual survivors.

            No kidding.  Made me think of my grandfathers, uncles and great uncles, the majority of whom survived brutal combat in WWI &amp; II and Korea.  One common trait?  The rest of their lives it took a lot to get them riled up.  They saw the existential elephant early in life, nothing else much matched it.  I think the average normie is getting fucking sick and tired of every little thing becoming “and millions will die”..  Hell by that standard we’ll have to dig up some of the dead and kill them twice…

            In a sane society they wouldn’t even have a platform for their insanity…My rage is directed at those who made the insanity possible…I feel sorry for those women who never had an anchor and a chance to grow up in a sane society…I pity them…PS My rage is also directed at those enforcers of the state who keep suicidal policies in play…

                People still have a responsibility to reign in their own insanity.That to me is the simple way of pointing out the locus of insanity that the left revolves around.Each individual lefty’s problems are ALWAYS somebody else’s problem to solve.  NEVER their own.It doesn’t really matter if you’re talking about supporting their own children, sexual assault, welfare, – whatever.  There’s never any focus whatsoever on personal responsibility. It’s always a societal issue, or somebody did it to them – whatever.I know a number of lefties and once you really see how they live their lives – you realize that non-responsibility for anything is the one common thread that runs thru their life.Eventually they just push it to a pathological extreme.

            When I see the media use the word “survivor”, I just substitute the word “accuser”.  Part of the reason that survivor is used is to lend an air of credibility.  After all, if you survive something, then that something must have happened.  With Ford, the media desperately wanted her to be a survivor, not an accuser.  They want the focus to be on “who did this crime?”, not “was there a crime”.

        One of the really despicable things about the Kavanaugh smear campaign was that it exploited a particular facet of female human nature: that women really like to comfort each other, and to be comforted.I remember, for example, when my small-town aunts and cousins came together to mourn the deaths of their sons and husbands. You could tell that, despite their grief, they really liked giving and receiving comfort. If war is the health of the state, then comfort is the health of the women.I took a tour of lefty woman Twitter, and it was clear that a lot of normie-left women supporting Ford, #MeToo, #BelieveSurvivors etc. were really just in Comfort Mode. Poor ladies just want to hug and be hugged.It’s just so ghastly that in our atomized society, women may not be close enough to their real family and community to express this emotion naturally, but instead have it stirred up by cynical Leninist political operatives who fabricate totally bogus rape stories for the purpose of getting political power to use for profoundly destructive ends.

        I finally broke down. After seeing it used by any number of morons, chitlibs, and xirl scientists, I finally forced to looked up “intersectionality”:Intersectionality is an analytic framework which attempts to identify how interlocking systems of power impact those who are most marginalized in society. Intersectionality considers that the various forms of what it sees as social stratification, such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, disability and gender, do not exist separately from each other but are complexly interwoven————————————————————————————————-I think we need antonym for that. Let’s call it outersectionality. It can be used to identify the interlocking powers and forces of privileged special interest groups to attack and weaken the people that support them.This was not some proggie circle jerk – this was a deliberate and premeditated political attack. Many people are high fiving each other because this scam attack was thwarted. I would advise extreme caution. The way the left will spin this is that now the system is so corrupt, that rapists are being elected to the supreme court; and because the system is no lawless, they are free to resist it without being limited by law either. What those people really want is to be able to haul their political enemies out of bed in the middle of the night – and ‘disappear’ them. Or a clear conscience when they physically assault them as their targets go about their day to day business.I grew up with these people, to them the moral high ground is entirely a social construct.

                Well it means moving from identifying the problem – which has been done Ad nauseam, here and every other alt-right, race aware blog there is.
What come next is recruiting, organizing, building teams, networks, support groups(not the whine kind); Gathering intel – like determining local and national level shot callers, identifying bad guys and money men.  Developing and refining tactics ranging from psyops, minor sabotage to direct kinetic actions.

        Have partially deferred to my spouse on this one…who was assaulted while in boarding school close to the same time as Ford.  First, she remembers every last detail exquisitely.  Second, that might be colored by the fact the kid made the mistake of going after the 5’11” girl who was on the U19 national team in her sport–got his ass kicked with the promise to finish the job if he tried again.  But she called bullshit on this from day 1 and did concede that Ford appeared to have a lot of other problems in her life–but was not buying any of the Kavanaugh story.

            Ha, sure.  Your wife was assaulted in boarding school, but she also kicked the shit out of her male assailant before he could finish the job.  And then Nelson Mandela emerged to give her a thumbs up, and everyone started clapping.This story is like a cuck supplication sampler platter.  Shitthatdidnthappen.txt.This is why serious people no longer believe most “survivors.”  Seems like 95% of women have some unfalsifiable, absurd, and/or self-aggrandizing story of being assaulted.  The whole phenomenon is so clearly an attention-whoring mechanism, at best, and at worst it offers significant cash and prizes.#Metoo is fashionable and participating carries no risk.  The shame of it is that the mostly UMC, batty liberal women making a big deal about this shit would also call you Hitler for mentioning something like Rotherham.

                Gonna revisit this one, because clearly my previous post was taken as a gratuitous personal attack on Saml and his wife.  That wasn’t why I wrote it.My real point is that Saml’s story plays into the Left’s frame, by suggesting that women in general and “survivors” in particular have greater standing to judge accusations like Blasey Ford’s.  Saml says he deferred to his wife on this one.  Why?We’ve seen the same sort of cowardly disclaimer attached to almost every opinion on the Kavanaugh hearings in the mainstream.  I understand the reflex, but you wouldn’t expect to see this sort of pandering on Z’s site, of all places, and especially not in response to this particular blog entry.That Saml’s account of his wife’s assault rings false is just icing on the cake.  But the issue isn’t just that the story rings false; of course it’s just barely possible that a teenage girl really did beat up a man who was trying to rape her, as women so frequently do in the movies.  The question is, again, why would Saml choose to share this particular story, on this particular site, in a comment thread about this particular issue?  Why does he feel obligated to adopt the Left’s farcical conceit that a woman’s pathetic combat prowess is something that men should gush over?If you read between the lines, Saml’s comment reinforces pretty much every Leftist stereotype on modern male-female relations, casting his wife as the badass strong woman, and himself as the doddering bobbleheaded husband the like of which has become a staple in TV commercials.I sincerely hope that Saml and those who enjoyed his comment take this criticism constructively, because what I’m describing isn’t a flaw in him, per se, but rather evidence that the unending Leftist propaganda campaign has affected him more than he realizes.

        George Carlin pointed this out years ago. The bastardization of the English language.
They dream up this nonsense and then present it with a straight face hoping everyone else will buy it. Should the loonies come into question they just double down on their rhetoric.
They got away with it for many years. Looks like the Kavanaugh hearings were the final straw. Although a 48 to 50 vote doesn’t exactly constitute a landslide.
Let’s hope this is the awakening of the normies.

                Well that’s an interesting point.  Absent the ginned-up rape hysteria, in cold analysis Kavanaugh is an Establishment squish, a total go-along-to-get-along, “he’s really evolved in office” Nowhere Man (hi, John!  we still love you anyways!).  In actuality the Left had nothing, zero, to fear from this squish.But they couldn’t bear to have Trump get any success, they couldn’t bear to have “privileged” White ( symbolically speaking, of course; WTF?!  The Irish are privileged?!  Have you read a single tittle of history?!)  success, the whole exercise is an object lesson in lack of self-restraint.  The Left could have snoozed through this, safe in the knowledge that Kav is a milquetoast, and saved their fire for when Trump nominates Ann Coulter (d.v.) to replace the hook-beaked hag-corpse RBG.But noooooo! (thank you John Belushi).  Their irresistible hatred for all White people, which is the genuine foundation of their creed, wouldn’t let them keep their counsel, and the insane/inane explosion of hate was a godsend.  The mask is soooo off, and millions of norm it’s are now seeing it.As the Wicked Witch once said, “I’m melting!! What a world, what a world…”

        The survivor drivel is of course nonsense but it makes for extremely effective rhetoric. Good rhetoric from our side is that which sends the prog insane with anger. Good rhetoric from their side is that which halts all discussion in the world of the normies; that which cannot be disputed.
Survivor is such an example. Another is heroic. They use that one an awful lot.

            Well, my belief is that people always believe in something. Even nonsense beats nothing. This is especially true of ruling elites. They need to believe their status is linked to the transcendent order of the universe. Is believing your special victim status entitles you to rule over whitey any more or less nutty than thinking your are the Sun King? Religions don’t have to make sense. They just need to scratch the itch that only religion can scratch.

                Religions purposefully do not make sense, and that’s how they create a sense of mystery and a chance to learn the mysteries of the universe.  Hoffer, once again, leads the way on this idea.
Bringing AH back into the story, the NAZIS were very envious of the commies having Marx’s made up nonsense as the basis for their movement.  Hence the NAZIS attempts to create a similar document out of old Germanic myths.  Didn’t really work out though.

                Exactly. The thing is, with a belief in an afterlife or any other spiritual realm foreclosed to progressives by modern scientism, their only alternative is to locate their nonsense within this world. Immanentizing the eschaton and all that.It’s one thing to believe in “nonsense” that is neither provable nor disprovable, but when they start making such claims about this world, the absurdity and cognitive dissonance can only be overcome by ever increasing hysteria. It’s like they’re covering their ears, shutting their eyes and shaking their heads, refusing to listen. But the voice they’re trying to block out is coming from within themselves, that tiny trace of rationality still slumbering within even the most deranged progressive.

                    the word that describes the progressive mind is “fantasy”; they live in self-constructed fantasy worlds.   this of course is an all consuming effort, and it eventually burns out their brains.   anything that threatens this construct is anathema to them.  and that is Trump’s real sin (in their diseased minds) — he makes it impossible for them to maintain their fantasy.

                It’s similar to the way ancient peoples would create ethnogenesis myths when their tribe had gained distinct identity and ascendency.  Like the myth of Romulus and Remus and Rome or the Julii and the myth that they were descended from Aeneas and the Trojans, or the probable myth of exodus.  For some reason they seem to hinge around lowly origins or the idea of having been an underdog at some point.  Rom and rem were foundlings like Moses, and obviously Aeneas and crew were refugees from the Trojan war.  It would be an interesting thesis to compile these are compare with other modern victim myths.

                These crazies are the Vestal Non-Virgins of the religion of Progressivism, the keepers of the sacred fire of Liberalism.They are present at all liberal rituals and protests, like Senate hearings on SCOTUS nominations and PETA rallies outside Whole Foods stores. To qualify they must be mentally and physically defective and repulsive to men except those who have gone through a torturous self-neutering process, over which they have the final say. They can intercede on behalf of favored men, using their magical powers to erase transgressions like rape, etc. by high priests like Bill Clinton, Barney Frank, Gary Hart, etc.  I know I’m messing up the metaphor but it was too much fun to pass up.

            I think people are too quick to declare that progressivism is dying; even I am guilty of this.  I think it is just metastasizing in a new form.  In 2018, Google or Facebook you could argue is more powerful than the US government, even if it does not appear that way on paper.  Progressives may be in the process of conceding the executive and legislative power of the government to conservatives and nationalists, realizing that they can better achieve their goals through trillion dollar multinational corporations.

and I agree that it is metastasizing; it’s the breakout phase of the process, when the disease has fully taken over the host like a house on fire.

                I have to agree with the pessimists. The left’s institutional power is enormous and demography is currently on their side.
Many people compare what’s going now with the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Just remember, they could only carry out that madness because they had enormous institutional power fifty years ago, and they *have kept that power to this day.*

                        Progs caught the rage virus ten years before the Civil Way. It’s been a one way trip since that time with little to stand in their way, with fortifying pauses we mistook as a return to first principles. That is why our host is seeking different principles if I understand correctly.OT, yesterday a sixty year old liberal lady of my acquaintance gushed over the accomplishments of Trump.

I had to talk the same lady down from the ledge one year ago, and she is a close personal friend of the Democrat candidate for Senate here in Nevada, a Nancy Pelosi light. Then I read a CNN piece alerting true believers that Trumps numerous and miraculous accomplishments against all odds were not working in their favor.  Altogether a strange week.

                If they are truly metastasizing from government over to corporations like Google and Facebook – then that is a good thing and not a bad thing.  This is a point I constantly bring up with right wingers – who don’t seem to be able to comprehend the nuances.  You don’t NEED Google, and you don’t NEED Facebook. Neither one of these companies have the ability in meatspace to do anything to you for not using their products in the same fashion that the government has if you refuse to obey it’s dictates or willingly accede to it’s tax rape.Force the leftist progressives out of the halls of government. Dismantle the structures they enacted to support their quest for power.  Repeal the laws. Let them run to the church halls of Google and Facebook and rant and rave. Make sure that one of the things that gets legalized nationally is Texas style self defense laws. Once everything is in place:  shut off their internet access.  When they can’t stand the silence anymore and start running loose in the streets and attacking people – the self defense laws will enable you to legally shoot them down.Problem solved.

            “So are all of these hysterics just a sign of the death knell of progressivism?”
—————————————————————————Not necessarily. In fact, recent events will probably be used to justify an escalation. Lefty will be shouting from the rooftops that now the system is so corrupt that rapists, racists, and homophobes are taking over the gubbimint – and more drastic opposition (read: violence) is necessary.

                ‘…rapists…..taking over the Government…’ is PRECISELY what I heard this morning on NPR.
“The (R) Party is now the party of sexual assault….”
I don’t know about you guys, but I just don’t have the time to 1) earn a living, 2) take care of the family, 3) be a homophobe, 4) be a racist, 5) assault women sexually, 6) go to church, 7) maintain the yard, and 8) pay attention to local, State, and national politics.
Maybe I’m too damn old, or something, but the energy?  Just ain’t there no more.

                    The key is to do two or three evil things at the same time, like those people who jog while pushing a baby carriage and looking at their phone.  For example, while mowing the lawn, you can call Lebron James a nigger *and* a fag, while thinking of raping that big titted Mexican actress.  Another approach is to make Monday racism day, Tuesday homophobe day, etc.  It’s like anything else, you only get out of it, what you put into it.

            No not the death knell of progressivism. This was just a battle not the war. The Left has regulatory capture of the system.  which makes them all but unstoppable given the current fractured state of whites in the U.S.And I don’t think we can judge the movement by the rent-a-goon and rent-a-hysteric peeps that Soros and others brought in to disrupt Kavanugh’s confirmation.It’s my contention that we need to look at the shot callers and not the hired help(blue haired harpies) to see what’s really going on. From what I see the progressive boss class are simply ruthless, brutal, power hungry thugs that will do or say anything to get what they want.

        Real existential threat started becoming extinct with the advent of civilization, and modern affluence has put the final nail in the coffin. As a species, we desperately miss the routine struggle that accompanied our ancestral daily life, and continuing to survive was validation of self-worth. What we are seeing today in some women’s rage behavior is the classic spoiled brat temper tantrum. They are indirectly saying to everyone around them . . .”look at me, I’m upset, do something about this now or I will clinch my fists and stamp my feet and hold my breath until I pass out, and then you’ll be sorry!!!!!!!!”

Whatever happens isn’t going to be pretty. Whether we have right wing death squads, wholesale leftist mass-murder of dissenters, worldwide economic collapse, or something totally unforeseen, the people who emerge on the other side will not be misusing the term “survivor.”

        You’re reading too deeply into this, confusing rhetoric with logic.Most of this rage is performative; they use words like “victim” and “survivor” not because it makes sense, but because it’s effective in triggering the emotions they want. The left has a long history of abusing language this way.If “survivor” means anything deeper, it is likely due to the fact their entire identity is built around leftism. They have nothing else in their lives, and so having their awful ideas ignored or rejected is literally, in their own words, “denying” or “invalidating” their “existence”. A “survivor” is thus anyone who bravely weathers the scorn and lives to #Resist another day.

            Indeed, one of the most exhausting things about doing battle with these people is their flexibility and shamelessness. If “survivor” wears out its welcome, they’ll just drop it and pick up a new rhetorical buzzword. For them, there is only the “truth” (ie, lie) of the moment.

        Two seperate women have told me they wish a man would break into their home and violently rape them.  Violently…not the lovey dovey kind of rape.  To the first one it was a fantasy.  Her number one fantasy.   To the second one it was a reality she truly hoped would happen.  She described in detail how he could smash the bedroom window, etc.  I told her that’s quite the fantasy.  She said it’s not a fantasy, I really hope it happens.  I didn’t want to ruin the mood so I held off on saying, “you realize there’s a good chance he kills you afterward right?”  I don’t think they mention that part in the romance novels.

            I swear I’m not making this up: my own awakening on this came when I found I could read the Kindle of a woman sitting across the aisle one row in front of me on an airplane. She was reading absolutely the most lurid rape-porn imaginable, about 10 levels below “50 Shades” in content, tone, and quality. I couldn’t BELIEVE it. And her husband was sitting next to her in the middle seat! At the time I was in shock, but subsequent education on the internet helped me out.

                Was it Bigfoot rape porn?  Or was she still hoping for a humanoid rapist?I don’t remember where I read this – it was probably Chateau Heartiste, and I haven’t done the research the verify the truth of it,  but one of the articles recently or maybe somebody in the comments section asserted that women very often will orgasm during actual violent rapes.It was also pointed out that 50 Shades of Grey is one of the best selling novels ever.I always keep these little tidbits of information in mind when I see all these women violently complaining about “sexual assault”.Given the psychology of it all – and the fact that women are involved – the most reasonable explanation is that off this pussy hat wearing and marching has nothing to do with what it looks like on the surface.

                Karl.  I don’t hang out with sloars, so no.   With the fantasy-only girl I didn’t have to “realize” anything.  She told me she wants me to do this to her.  Play acting, but make it real.  Burst into her home one night in a mask, etc.  I never did.  Not out of moral qualms.  I just never got around to it.  ha.  She was putting out anyway.  I guess I felt why bother going through the trouble.

                    Given the ability to change their version of events on the whim of the moment, it’s probably best you never did carry thru with that request.This whole Kavanaugh thing seems to have made an awful lot of men aware of a phenomenon I became aware of 35 years ago when I was in college – and that is women’s ability to manufacture “sexual assault” charges out of thin air.AND – (and this is the most crucial piece of the puzzle) – their corollary ability to change their mind at a moment’s notice.IF you had ever gone thru with that request – you would have just put yourself into the shit zone and given that woman the ability to legitimately go to the police and say she was ACTUALLY violently assaulted.Men assume that women have the same center of logic and consistency of thought that they do.  It’s taken me many years and living with women to get it drummed into my head – that they absolutely do NOT.This is one of the underlying reasons for the MGTOW “movement” , it’s because many men want to live in a world of consistency and progress and logic – and bringing a woman into their world , especially some of the specimens of the current age – introduces disorder, chaos – and insanity.Increasing amounts of men are saying “fuck this shit” – and making a decision to limit their exposure to women.

            Yep, and what leftist redistribution scheme can fix that?  Pinpointing why the left is so angry and why it has gotten so much worse is hard, but I have to believe that this a big contributor.  Women who come from upper middle class backgrounds who are not attractive seem to be quite angry, especially if they went to elite schools.

        “The concept of intersectionality is an effort to become victims by proxy.”Surviving victimhood has become the highest goal because we live in a safe time, at least on the surface of things. Anyone can become a victim at any time without much effort. You can even imagine yourself into victim status. Its built into the structure of the world. But surviving becoming a victim means you accomplished something and it gives you the feeling of heroism. Its a debased way to achieve heroism among people who still have an instinct to know that hero is better than victim.“American Jews have turned the holocaust into something that dwarfs the flight from Egypt.”That’s part of the reason that American Jewry is shrinking and why the mainstream American Jewish denominations are dying out. A narrative about surviving adversity or persecution is useful and can motivate people; an endless dirge where redemption only comes from voting Democrat isn’t.“It’s why white and Jewish male Progressives have been falling all over themselves in support of this.”The reason that white/Jewish Progressives are supporting this even though they are at the bottom of the hierarchy of this specific religion is that its really hard to give up a religion you believe and are invested in, even if it doesn’t really benefit you anymore. Also there is environment to consider as well; in the supposed civilized urban circles were most of these people live, this is all there is for them. Renouncing it is a leap into the lonely darkness. If they were brave enough to do it, they’d have done so already.

        The other thing going on is that (Kavanaugh, Trump, the Republicans, and so on) “might” do this and “might” do that.  Judge them on what they actually do, not on what they “might” do.  The flip side, for the loonies, is to ask not to be judged by what they actually do, but by the “well-meaning” intentions of their despicable actions.

        99% of these insane women are lying about having suffered sexual abuse.  Heartiste recently posted a lengthy comment about this.  What they do have though, are raving rape fantasies.Know who else had a burning desire to be raped?  Ayn Rand!  It really is too funny.  Not coincidentally, Rand was a mutt.  this movie (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140447/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_8) is very entertaining in its coverage of her voracious sexual appetite — as shown by the always bangable Helen Mirren.Zman, what’s your take on Rand’s writing?  Not a fan boi, and not looking for confirmation of my own vies — just curious on your take 🙂  I kind of want to join one of those objectivists groups and sample the wares so to speak.

        So basically white women need their “victim” participation trophy now to keep up with the Progressive purity spiral. I’m so shocked…
The rabidness of the response to normie chad Kavanaugh has been entertaining. Clawing on the doors of the SCOTUS building. You just couldn’t make this shit up.  I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the Coalition of Freaks totally shatters by 2020. The cracks are there but I fear the cucks will do what they always do…

            Don’t confuse those paid actors with the directors and financiers who made the shit show possible to begin with. The fact is the Left has achieved regulatory capture of the system, MSM and BigTech and has enormous funds at it’s disposal. Their politicians control almost all cities.And they are organized.  They aren’t going anywhere.Remember these punks drove Trump out of San Jose and CA by beating the shit out of his supporters almost in front of him. All he could later on is show that Mexicans liked him. He flat out refused to condemn what happened.Point is they will f**k with anyone. All they lack at the moment is the guts to drop the hammer on us. But that will change within the next few years.

        My understanding of the black bodies thing is that it’s another form of the race is only skin deep meme.  From ta nehisi Coates I think.  The idea is that we are identical except that some of us have “black bodies,” and I suppose that the majority of us are using numeric superiority to exploit those of us who randomly end up in “black bodies.”  The flip side is “people who think they are white.”  He calls it the “demon religion of whiteness.”  Do you think they actually believe this crap?I was in this little high end used book store where I live and a very swanky looking young couple came in and were looking at the interesting sections.  I am always curious about such people and struck up a conversation.  They were from San Francisco, read the classics, your general penguin stuff, but they had become enthralled with nonfiction, and listed ta naheisi coates, and several other books on race relations in the US.  I simply turned around and walked away.  What could keep otherwise intelligent people interested in such nonsense?

        Bottom line is that it enrages young women/feminists that nature didn’t give them the confidence, intelligence, and technical articulation that guys have.   They just can’t compete.  It’s impossible to picture women being as unflappable and cocky as this kid.

        The left has redefined words that simply elicit responses to further their negative narrative.  Ford if exposed purposely by the Dems after the contentious 36 hour grilling of Brett Kavanaugh.  Her wanting to remain anonymous if indeed that was her intent seems to stretch the facts we now know.  She went to have a polygraph, she seems to have forgot to bring any hard evidence to the table to corroborate her story which took place sometime 36 years prior.  The fact that Dianne Feinstein sat on the letter honoring Fords request to remain anonymous all of a sudden the letter was leaked and wa la the whole world seems to have exploded for the Democrats.  They threw out any pretension of the rule of law, they went for Kavanaugh’s juggler, wanting his blood without any evidence to support Fords claim except a fabricated story about she as a 15 year old was at a party and she new the names of four people who she said would verify her story, well that didn’t prove true, they all disavowed her story.  Also her yearbook photo of her was to most people showed a homely young girl that frankly why would anyone try and hook up with her.  That said, it’s getting to the point that the Democrats are just ridiculous,  and to most Americans showing their out of control socialist attitudes and hopefully November 6th we’ll vote many of them out, bringing America back to our historic sense of exceptionalism.

        My take is that this is all about further denigrating and sidelining white men. For decades American boys and men have been cultivated to be more feminine, passive, weak. As Z Man has pointed out, the Left is running out of grievances as civil rights issues were “solved” in the 60’s and never have women been so empowered as they are in the United States in this day and age. Z Man discussed as well how the democratic voting base always seeks to expand. A few days ago, Tucker Carlson had Tammy Bruce on to talk about the Kavanaugh situation. (For those who don’t know her, she’s a former Leftist Feminist who now identifies as Independent and is invited on Tucker’s show to ‘splain womyn issues.) Occasionally she makes a really good point and I thought she did the other day, commenting:“I contend this that, in fact, now the Democrats have decided that they’ve got to figure out a way to divide even the households to make women think that the men in their lives are the enemy. And so, if whether it is your husband or your son or your brother or your dad that in fact men, White men in particular, because the White women’s vote was the issue, are — are people you cannot trust.”https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/tucker-carlson-on-the-democrats-fbi-hypocrisy-aclu-sponsors-ad-comparing-kavanaugh-to-cosby
