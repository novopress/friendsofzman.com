        I have seen no reason to declare Rodger mentally ill. What I see is a class of people who need to explain him in those terms. He is not so different from John Walker Lindh, who’s career as a Muslim convert and enemy combatant began with the amazing coincidence of his father leaving the family–for another man. Nothing to see there, move along.

        Ann Hornaday is just doing her job. She wrote a story explaining a tragedy using the rhetoric of white male privilege and entitlement because that’s what semi-literate people want to read and share with their friends these days. If she wasn’t willing to cook up a trendy think-piece that supplied the meaning and emotions people crave she’d be out of work, but newspapers and websites would still publish their fashionable narratives and you and the rest of the arch two point five sigma+ crowd would just label Ann’s replacement stupid. That’s how the world works.As for the beta male brigade and the eerie parallels between Rodger’s rhetoric and theirs, I have to agree with roissy &amp; friends that the “sexual marketplace” is a very strange place in 2014 and a lot of “betas” seem extremely bitter whenever they glance at reality. Fortunately, most don’t: they’re too busy playing video games (the amount of time young men spend on video games is underappreciated). But for truth-obsessed people nerds, as Sailer calls them/us, the facts on the ground are startling, with “riding the cock carousel until it’s time to find a sucker” being a pretty damn accurate description of what most young women are up to. Find a good looking meathead from the gym and ask him to show you his Tinder account. It’s enough to blow a beta’s mind.

        Half Sigma is a bright Jew who received an undergrad degree from an ivy (Penn) and then a Law degree from a much lower ranked school (?Arizona State?). He qualified for a high IQ society that requires much higher scores than Mensa but his IQ is not high enough to gain entrance into the 160+ level societies.He is an odd duck to be sure. At one point he was walking around NY City taking photos on the sly of people he saw as he walked. He may still be doing that.My impression of him is that he is not happy in his skin hence his interest in this latest spree killer who had some smarts but little skill in coping with life’s obstacles. Both of them appear to be similar it appears.Dan Kurt
