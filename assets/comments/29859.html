        Turkey’s election is near, I think May 14, and Erdogan is slated to lose given polling. There is an alliance of the opposition parties cemented by the CIA and the opposition candidate promises to undue all actions by Erdogan. Even if he he wins, expect another coup attempt like the one in 2016 that Putin warned him of (which explains much). That coup was hatched out of Incirlik Air Base and there remains even after purges many loyal to the US inside Turkey’s military.There are also disturbing speeches given by both Yellen and Blinken on China/National Security. Yellen essentially said the US will cooperate on China following the line on global warming, transgenders, the like, that’s it. Blinken called for massive protectionism and massive increases in government spending, on the theory that industry can be magically conjured by administrative fiat. Because important people are waking fast and talking fast just like the West Wing.I fully expect some sort of two front war around Summer, against Russia with US troops fighting directly, and against China in Taiwan. I will note there were lonely articles in the FT calling for business to “fight back” against war fever against China, so there is a lot of sunk investment by big corporations now complaining that the neo-cons hold on government means they are not being listened to wrt China war fever. The Biden as VP selling policy changes to China could be thus business interests trying to throw a monkey wrench into the war escalator by having a Biden impeachment and thus force Dems into defending all things China and Chinese to protect their figurehead. You can’t take anything at face value.FWIW Warren Buffett noted he’s selling off Taiwanese investments, as he does not like the geopolitical risk.

            A very astute analysis, except that getting U.S. troops involved in war with either Russia or China would be disastrous:  requiring a new draft with potentially millions of men refusing to go(because women are not drafted, among other reasons) and, with the nation already $32 trillion+ in debt, an explosion of inflation. Americans had better wake up and root out the miserable warmongers in their midst, but this will take that rarest of resources: moral courage.

        Z’s sense that there’s something “stirring” in the Ukraine is confirmed by the fact that the YouTube robots have begun another campaign to save my soul from the dark hand of Putler. Specifically, I’ve noted that just prior to new developments occurring there I start to see these mysterious new channels in my feed. They tend to be sort of ra-ra-ra jingo-tech stuff meaning that there’s an emphasis on guns and other military technology but with a clear “this is how we’re gonna beat Putler, you just watch” message. I’m sure the robots chose this emphasis because of my watching gun channels and spots about new technology. I always click “do not show this channel” but they always find more of the same shit anyway.The latest one was a video with the headline “US smokes Russian mercs” and a picture of an AC-130 gunship. The video was supposedly a month old by the time they decided to feed it my evil Slavo-nazi soul. Thankfully, the headline is almost certainly a lie since any direct engagement of the US against even Wagner would be a clear step to WWIII and I’m pretty sure I’d have noticed a world war if it had started last month.In any case, it’s an odd bit of stoyak (as Severian calls it). The AC-130 is an odd bird in fact. It’s precisely the kind of tech that pretty much only a country accustomed to beating the shit out of dirt-worlders armed with “assault rocks” would invest in. This is basically a huge, slow cargo plane larded up with every kind of heavy gun and the ammo to feed it. It has one tactic – it flies low and in a circle. The idea is that the enemy is supposed to gather in the center of the circle singing kum-ba-ya and beating prayer drums while the flying school bus full of guns rains fire on them. Now I have no doubt that this worked quite well on the sand n**grs. I seem to recall the Russians are quite good at the air defense game though. Somehow, I’m not seeing how the Wagner guys would fail to notice (and quickly deal with) the circling school bus ‘o death. Indeed, it would have become a SAM magnet before it got anywhere near them.It’s a nice little insight into what the YT bot-boys think the typical Trumptard will believe about America’s abilities and those of its enemies though.

            I too just had a “Ukrainians repulse Wagner attack” video show up in my youtube feed. And I don’t watch Ukraine videos. Or political videos in general. But there it was. I had never noticed a video like that in my feed before.

                These videos always stand out from my feed for that reason too. That’s why I’m sure this stuff is a deliberate propaganda effort. Also, while I can’t prove it because I didn’t used to pay close attention to the dates these things show up, but it actually DOES seem that the propaganda videos *foreshadow* developments in Ukraine. This tells me that YT (and by extension probably all the social media companies) are tightly integrated into the regime to the point where the DOD tells them AND Zelensky’s minions what to do and say at about the same time. Free marketplace of ideas and all that bullshit you know…

        do you like this metaphor for america as basically a dormant cancer where it was always there and people were able to live there lives. But at some point, the symptoms started showing up and people are wondering what the hell happened. Like if you want to go back to the days of americana nostalgia that you see at a cracker barrel. I’m sure there was a rot in the country at the time. But the difference is it was easier to escape/avoid or even pretend didn’t exist. We could all have polite fictions.

            Sure, there were dormant problems, like founding our country on values and not race, and allowing black slaves.  On the other hand, it’s typically not useful to criticize something based on the standard of perfection.  In that spirit, was there ever an existing place and time that was better for a people than the United States before the 1863 was for whites?

        Mr. Z, if you are still interested in rural property in West Virginia then you might enjoy watching Outdoors with the Morgans on YouTube today. They just posted a video showing the delivery and setup of their folding mini-cabin on their recently purchased land there.

        They finally arrested Gonzalo again:
https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2023/05/us-vs-gonzalo-lira/
I’m surprised they let him go on this long. Dude was playing with fire. Also, not so cool to leave your wife and kids hanging like this.
In a figurative sense, Scott Ritter was correct when he mistakenly reported Lira’s deceased the first time the SBU arrested him.

        Gotta tell you Z-man,  I was listening to Glenn Greenwald and Michael Tracy on Rumble last. Michael Tracy was treating the Kagan Cult, the Institute for the Study of War as some great revelation or a scoop.I thought to myself, “self, I’ve known about this from before the invasion. Why? Because I listen and subscribe to this and SubscribeStar.”NONE of any of my acquaintances have any idea what I’m talking about when I say “Kagan Cult”.Thanks.

            Russia is trying to do the consequence-free war bullshit like we did with Bush’s War of Terror or Lyndon Johnson’s Guns and Butter.  So they’re making the mercs do all the heavy fighting while the Russian regulars stay back to prevent casualties among the conscripts that would potentially piss off the public and create war weariness.No one cares if mercenaries die, since they’re more well understood by the public as murderers for hire (people who join the regular military on the other hand are there to save democracy and puppies from the bad guys).The tendency on the DR is clinging to hope, and this last year a lot of it has been the hope that Russia is Orthodox Gondor holding out at the last bastion against Sauron.  The unfortunate reality is that the Russian proles like their kerosene-adulterated heroin a lot more than going to church and the Russian elites are just as infested with the same triple-bracketed goblins, although their Uruk-hai are produced by cross-breeding Men with steppe Orcs instead of jungle Orcs.

                    Ploppy is right though.
Both, Russian Armed Forces and WG are composed more of toothless Timmys than well trained and equipped, motivated soldiers.
The counsel of despair and surrender?  Funny that you mention that while expecting some shady dictator from the other end of the world, to help you clean up rot and decay in your own society…
Surrender and impotence you say?

                        We expect nothing of the sort. We simply hope Russia inflicts a stinging defeat on the malevolent GAE, and in so doing, precipitates its sojourn to history’s cesspit. After that happens, we can then go about building a new white nation where mere normalcy reigns supreme.

                        @Ostei
I wish you good luck in this endeavor, unironically.
How that can be done with crumbling economy, weak, confused and conflicted society devoid of any common sense remains to be seen.
At the same time there will be forced shift to AI driven command economy, to which masses of people phased out of work by technology will be surrendering in hope of retaining bits of wealth and status they got so used to in the past.
People hoping for a spontaneous return of  sanity are up for some WTF.

                        It’s certainly better for us if Russia wins as it undermines the legitimacy of GAE.  But the truth is still that we’ve quite a bit of Russia stepping on its own dick over the past year.  The infighting between Wagner and the MOD is the perfect example of this: they view each other as rivals and are more focused on undermining the other than on winning the war.  So the MOD withholds ammo, then Wagner threatens to quit the field.It reminds me of a video explaining why the Soviet Union’s computer research never went anywhere.  Each group working on computer technology refused to share their information with the other groups because they didn’t want to risk any of their funding being diverted.  Or the myriad Slavic proverbs that equate to the “genie will grant your wish but also give twice what you get to your neighbor: ok poke out one of my eyes”.

                So true! Putin was very happy playing the Godless Communist when it suited his ambition, and now he walks around clutching  the cross as if he were some kind of Christian(are there any out there?) Christ at least tossed the money- changers out  of the temple- who is going to throw the MIC SOB’s out on their ear? When the Kerrigan Brothers chained themselves to the White House fence, and the Vietnam Veterans Against War hurled their medals over it, it was front page news- any and all protest is now muzzled in the MSM. A nation of Lapel-Pin Patriots.

Because, when the Whites are gone, the only whites left will be /fellow whites/.

        I got in bunch of arguments early on in the sanctions regime.  People did not seem to comprehend that a country that is largely self sufficient in 1)energy 2)food and 3) critical natural resources (including gold) is largely proof against a sanctions regime.  If that same country supplies most of its now-belligerent neighbors with these critical needs, you’ve created a bigger problem.  We had to do a “Russian hunt” at work to suss out any “bad people”, it was silly.  Seizing assets out of the financial system is already creating problems.  Wait until you are not the dominant reserve currency and nobody wants USD—the credit card gets shut off.

        Wonder if that big Russian troop buildup over the winter — for a “spring offensive” that never materialized — might be launching a spoiling attack on the big Uke summer offensive here soon. Wouldn’t that be a hoot?
Probably not, because I gather the Ukrainians aren’t really built for offense — they’re more built for “sitting in bunkers like chumps getting shelled,” because that’s what their idiot AINO trainers / financiers insisted upon — so a spoiling attack would actually be playing to their one sorta-strength… but still. It would be hilarious.

                My personal theory is that the Russians will eventually seek piece once they’ve taken everything east of the Dnieper River. River crossings for assaults can be a bitch, and they’ve said they don’t want to occupy all of Ukraine. I just wonder if Zelensky or his puppeteers would agree to terms

                    I believe that draftees can be used outside Russia in a declared war in defence of Russia. Not so in the case of aid to allies in Syria for example. Putin’s SMO may be a way to keep some of the more rabid warmongers in Moscow on side.

            The Seth Rich cope presumes the existence of a Democratic campaign worker who’s not only above partisanship but willing to risk death by ratting out his bosses for principle and patriotism.
I’m slightly surprised Kim would lie about it. We have no idea who did the leak. All the information we have about it is garbage. Rich’s connection to it is *made up*.

My point is that he does have a big mouth and lies, but this should be weighed against his actions that have been impactful and illustrate that he is not just hot air – he is not simply and exclusively a liar.

        The wickedness of these people was clear with the sanctions on Iraq. Probably a million people died because US sanctions specifically blocked water filtration components – probably half of the body count children. Declassified documents back around 2000 confirmed this wicked intent. I am no great empathizer, but imagine how you would view a country that deliberately starved your kids to death. To think about watching my youngest shrivel up and die makes me hate these people for their evil, evil gaze.

            The US killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children and feeling it was worth it because they didn’t like Saddam marks the American Empire as one of or maybe the most bloodthirsty Empire in history. This alone puts a lie to American officials and media prattling on about values.What gets discussed less by the right is it shows that the white American people are not worth saving. Americans didn’t care because they weren’t told to care. Even if they see that clip of Albright few Americans care.I respect much of traditional white culture as much as the next non woke white person but increasingly have no use for whites or their tribal masters. The world will be much better off and the anuses of young boys will be a lot safer when the American Empire recedes into history and with it the influence of white women and their masters.

                Maybe they didn’t care because it was arab children dying. If it were white children their opinion of it may have been very different.
In that same vein, you don’t see them give a tinker’s damn about slaughter in Africa or Asia, but when there’s a war in Yugoslavia or Ukraine…. of course in the latter they were told to care early and often, and when they are told to care they usually do

                        I’m seeing it more as a racial preference thing even by people who claim not to have one. Same phenomenon manifests in whites getting up in arms over white kids getting shot at school, but not caring at all about black kids getting shot in black neighborhoods.

                I completely agree. White Americans are sickly – hell, they mutilate their own children. Look, I am all for hating your enemy, absolutely. But, to me, the average american’s indifference means it cannot be called a desire for blood of your enemies. Firther, iraq was no enemy. They were an ally we betrayed. Enjoying the suffering of the kids is not hating your enemy, it is simply wickedness
White americans are sick – Molly Tibbets… never forget. The level of self loathing is insane.As poster noted, whites are responsible for all of this mess, including diversity.

                You know, when I first read your post, I bridled. But, the more I thought about it, the more I had to admit you are right.Eighty-five to 90 percent of American whites just ain’t worth a shit. They’re either ectomorphic dweebs with skinny clothes and scraggly beards or paunchy louts whose concept of rightism extends no farther than their gun rack. Both loathe their own heritage and civilization preferring instead to worship Afro-savages who never would have learned to wipe their arses without white tutelage.This is not the stock upon which to build a new nation, let alone to instaurate civilization. It will be up to the white remnant and whites in other parts of the world.

                    “It will be up to the white remnant and whites in other parts of the world.”One must here consider the concept/theory—first posed by Woodley—of “spiteful mutants”.  Basically, how does the “deserving” remnant of the White race survive and thrive with those “mutants” in their ranks?A conundrum to be sure.  What we can be sure of is that these mutants will not simply perish and die off as leaves falling from the tree in Fall to make room for renewed vigorous growth in the Spring.  They will remain in large numbers and be a tremendous obstacle to renewal of the values that made the White race great.What is needed is a new concept of how one partakes in this renewal—should it ever come about.  My initial thinking is that a new nation concept must be built upon “earned citizenship”.  Universal suffrage based on simple existence as we have now is doomed to failure.

                        I suspect the spiteful mutants and most of the grillers will prefer to remain with their God-pets, wherein they will ultimately perish. They are more like them than us anyway, so good riddance. If I’m right, the separation itself will also be a purification of sorts.

        This is very very very off-topic vis a vis the situation in Ukraine, but it looks like the Z-man’s old buddies over at American Greatness have decided to slit their own wrists.  I know they tend to be something of a normie-Con site, but they post some good stuff now and again that’s a lot nearer to our side of the great divide than anything the p*****s at NR would ever produce.  They’ve even given pretty free rein to Paul Gottfried to post his stuff whenever he wants to.Now they’ve gone ahead and killed the comment sections like so many of these other right-wing sites.  The plebes must realize they job is only to consume content and not sass back about anything they take issue with.

            It can’t be much fun being mocked in the comments section. Colorblind CivNats have no answer to this reality: institutions are downstream from culture which is downstream from biology.Change the biology and you change everything.If you bring this up, AmGreat types either have to1) sound like Woke crazies and say that there’s no such thing as race or biological differences, which forces them to repudiate natural selection, i.e., openly say that they’re morons; or2) acknowledge racial differences and admit that they’re entire worldview and morality are wrong.Neither path is acceptable so they shut you down. They really have no other choice.

                They aren’t practiced with the leftist technique of arguing with you by claiming they don’t understand anything you’re saying and that every word means something other than it’s common meaning, thus forcing you to run around in circles in a futile attempt to get them to actually respond to your point until you finally give up and leave.

                    I want to put in a nice word for Julie Kelly but whether wittingly or not, what she’s really doing is putting the fear of God into us. Seems like the regime would be pleased with her reporting in that sense.
VDH, for his part, is doing a very nice job of getting everyone used to the idea that it’s not our country anymore. And nothing else.

                        I listen to his podcasts quite a bit, mostly to fill in on an academic weakness in Classicall era history.  But Hanson has developed a real edge in the last couple of years—it wasnt there before.  Being Swedish, I feel like he’s on the edge of shifting from reticence to Viking berserker at any minute.  With no warning.  And he’s old enough and has made enough money to not give a shit.

Yeah, you can see the anger building in VDH, but he’s trapped in his colorblind CivNat mindset so he doesn’t know what to do with that anger.
He just can’t bring himself to cross the great divide to our side, but he also can’t stop looking at the destruction happening to what was once his country. He’s a conflicted man.
You definitely get the feeling that if he ever breaks free from his CivNat mental shackles, he’s going to go at it hard.

                        VDH can’t break from CivNatery as to do so logically entails an acceptance of HBD science.  HBD science is a “bridge too far” for most Normies.  However, I can accept that they often embrace the concept in all *but* name.
Once they’ve started talking about Whites vs Blacks—or simply Whites vs minorities—it’s all but over.  One need not press for the specific terminology.

                    I don’t know who funds AG, but I’ve been wondering along similar lines lately as well.  What I’ve found absolutely maddening lately is the total refusal of so-called conservative commentators to be honest about the widespread voter fraud in 2020 and 2022.  You see endless commentary about how the GOP can appeal more to the youth vote or how nominating someone “without baggage” like Meatball Ron means more soccer moms returning to the GOP but – even if there’s some merit to the argument – what difference does it make when the Dems have all the panel trucks full of fake ballots they need to overcome any marginal upticks in the number of votes for the Republican candidate.  Even Gottfried of all people has been terrible on this score and churned out a bunch of columns on how the GOP needs to adjust their stand on this, that or the other thing.What I suspect is that a lot of deep pockets that are keeping these sites afloat are telling the staff to stay away from the issue of fraud.  They just don’t want to go near the issue.  Maybe they have some fears about lawsuits or they just don’t want to rock the boat, but the word has gone out to ignore voter fraud.  We can get some clicks discussing abortion or trannies in Disneyland and that’s all we need to do to keep the site running.

                        The strategy of ignoring fraud has a limited shelf life though.
They can still plausibly blame everything on Trumps toxicity.

            In the age of cancel culture, I don’t thinkanypublishing outlet wants to be even peripherally responsible foranycontent they don’t absolutely control, and that includes the comments sections. Coincidentally, something I just wrote at Sailer’s is relevant to this topic:Other countries often have laws that strictly control the type of information that can be published about criminal suspects before their trials, and the reasoning behind these laws is pretty cogent. You don’t want to give notoriety to the criminal or to the crime, or further embarrass the victims, or taint the criminal proceedings with public expectations of a verdict, or defame somebody who might end up being judged not guilty who could then come back and sue you. In order to avoid these outcomes, they make use of a codified system that tells publishers beforehand what they can and can’t say. It may not fit with American ideals of freedom of expression, but at least everybody knows where the boundaries are. It was the violation of these laws that took down that Tommy Robinson guy. Anybody remember him?The American system is more flexible due to our free speech traditions, but for that very reason it is correspondingly worse. Not only does it allow publishers to influence public opinion by selectively omitting certain facts that they might legally have been able to publish (which is the issue that the Stevies always complain about in these threads), but it also means that American corporations are forced to navigate an ever-changing litigation battle-scape where judge and jury might bankrupt you for saying things you thought were well within your rights. This is the age of cancel culture after all, and who knows where the blade might fall next.Is it really out of the realm of possibility that media outlets might choose to voluntarily adopt a more British system of publishing standards, just to protect themselves? If you were a newspaper owner, what wouldyoudo? That’s not a rhetorical question, by the way. You really have to think about that if you want to honestly evaluate what might be going on.Most people here cheered on the Nick Sandmann civil suit verdict; they really shouldn’t have. That’s the kind of thing that will ensure you’ll never get accurate reporting again, just in case there was any doubt; and it revealed just how shallow the Alt-right’s commitment to free speech really is.As a Traditionalist of the paleo-right, I do not have philosophical commitments to free speech ideals. I actually believe there should be restrictions on speech, and that heresy and lèse-majesté should be illegal. I am consistent in what I think. But the Alt-Right is the mirror image of the Progressive Left insofar as it hypocritically demands freedom of speech, but only for the speech it agrees with. If you really believe in free speech, you should have encouraged Nick Sandmann to stand down. You didn’t, and this is what you get.

                Nick Sandman case is a poor example.  He was not a public figure and was the victim of outright lies/deception wrt the incident in question and to his portrayal in it.  As a non-public figure, the standard of reporting wrt to accuracy vs “opinion” is  much higher.  It of course did not help when the news media was shown to have willfully excluded facts to portray him is the worse possible light.  The media acknowledged this and settled quickly before risking an even worse outcome in the courts.There is no such thing as absolute free speech.  We do not perhaps have encoded law/guidance as in some European countries, but we do have a hundred plus years of case law and rulings which outline the difference between slander and opinion quite clearly.You mention the “British system”.  Well, I do know one thing about their system, truth is not an absolute defense against slander.  It is here in the US.  It can never be a loss to the DR to  hold the MSM accountable in the matter of truth in reporting—especially in a time of control of media by biased corporations attempting to shape the political process.

Good! The Alt-right’s commitment was to White Nationalism.
Thanks for the laugh though, one doesn’t expect to see many “principled conservatives” airing their silly notions in comment sections these days, what with all the mockery they receive from anyone who isn’t part of their geriatric bubble.

            Yes. And before they killed the comments they had some easily triggered censors who would troll users and get confrontational over ridiculous things. Of course, the sacred cow subjects were about the usual suspects, and the active censors were of the usual suspects.

                What was really starting to crack me up lately is how all these left-wing trolls were setting up phony accounts generally just to cut-and-paste a bunch of talking points over there.  Some of them would try a little improv, but they would always be brand new accounts with a locked comment history and only a 100 or so posts.  For the most part nearly all 100 of their posts would be on just a single article!What are these guys really trying to accomplish?  Are these the same guys who’d do the old “seminar caller” bit from Rush Limbaugh days?  Are they paid to do it by some political operation?  I really don’t understand who they think they’re fooling, or why they think it’s advancing an agenda in any way.  Maybe the plan is just to poison the well with so much noise and nonsense that people start giving up on participating in the discussion, but I really don’t know.

                    “Maybe the plan is just to poison the well with so much noise and nonsense that people start giving up on participating in the discussion,…”Precisely.  That’s all it is.  The main point is to disrupt a coherent thought/theme to be discerned from the comments.The secondary effect is to—on the surface—present an impression of a significant voiced opposition to the article in question.  Another goal is to distract the comment section from the topic at hand in the discussion and on to insignificant points, i.e., thread hijacking.All of these problems have been discussed in forums elsewhere with examples and responsible groups identified.  In the end, the commenter loses interest in the article/blog and moves on.We even had for a while a troll in this group by the name of “Tiny Duck” who was at this group’s behest, banned.

        The west isn’t looking to win in Ukraine necessarily.  We just want to bleed Russia for as long as possible and exhaust them in order to weaken domestic support for the Putin regime.  Sure, if they could have Putin hanging upside down like Mussolini and the Russians importing a government of American neocons to rule them like at the end of the Cold War, that would be the neocons’ wet dream, but they realize that is unlikely.  They just want to put external pressure until the government loses support.  This will likely be after Putin dies.  I would compare it to our approach against Egypt.  Used to be the strongest Arab country and the biggest opponent of Israel under nasser.  External pressure and multiple failed attempts to get Egypt into war against the US( Lavan affair, attack on uss Liberty, etc.).  Egypt was weakened, but nasser was never really overthrown.  But when nasser died, Egypt was ready for a more compliant government and to get with the western program.  Putin and nasser are analogues in this scheme of thought.  We don’t have to “win” Ukraine.  The neocons “win” every second the clock tics if the war is going on still.

                        I watched a video short awhile back of Zelensky on his comedy show right after he won election. The video was on a foreign news site, cause you would NEVER see such a thing in the U.S. or Europe.
He read a “humorous” statement (yes, straight off a piece of paper), joking about what they all wanted to accomplish. It was a screed that was Nazi to the core, and the audience was eating it up and laughing. Those people wanted it real good, and now they’re getting it real hard. I don’t feel sorry for any of them.

            Putin dies then the cult gets Medvedev.    The Kagan Cult has miscalculated.   What they have accomplished is to put Russia and China into an invincible alliance along with Iran and possibly a few others.This may partially explain to urgency of the GAE to engage Russia and China now while they still possess what they think is the most powerful military in the world.  At this point they are most likely wrong about that as well.There are some sources you can find that will give a pretty good gauge of the average Russian’s views.   Previously many were positively inclined to the West and wanted good relations.   That has changed.   Most Russians are angry and fearful of the West now.    That is not likely to change anytime soon.

            Perhaps the biggest failure of the neocons, and that’s saying something, is never, in the decades since, updating or modifying their core philosophy of the 1992 Wolfowitz Doctrine, in spite of its limitations and flaws. It enjoys the status of religious doctrine, consequences (especially the unintended ones) be damned. You can sort of forgive, or at least understand, someone thinking the way they did in 1992, but still thinking that way by 2020 is inexcusable.It should be apparent, to anyone with a brain cell or two, the recklessness of provoking war with Russia on its doorstep in the absence of any compelling national interest, or even imperial interest. Russia is not Egypt, or Iraq, or Libya, or Syria, or Afghanistan. Not at all.It’s enough to make you suspect the whole thing is a show and Putin is in on it. How else to explain such otherwise inexplicable recklessness

It’s worse than that. When the navy has a chick-with-a-dick as their representative, and EVERY Democrat I talk to thinks it’s horrible to remove anal and oral sexually explicit books from school libraries, it goes deeper than that. Nothing will change until those people are gone.

            Problem is, it’s exhausting the West faster than the Russians.  See the latest production numbers out of Germany? Down the most since (ex wartime) since the 20s crash.  One of my kids has been parked in Denmark for the last 8 weeks working to get another LNG carrier into service and has spent most of his time since 1/1 shuttling around Europe on similar projects.  The Euros know they lucked out with a mild winter.  The Danes he’s working with up on the Baltic know damn well the US blew up Nordstream and are not happy.  Won’t even bother to go into the BRICs expansion currently underway.

                What am I missing about Germany? I don’t understand how their heavy industry remains competitive when the country goes from below-average energy costs before the war to above-average energy cost from now on.I don’t what what % energy costs make up of industry costs, but I’d assume quite a bit. This permanent change in energy costs seems like it would require either 1) substantially reduced wages or 2) moving production to countries with cheaper energy costs, likely the US.I suppose that the companies could get more efficient, but it’s not as though they weren’t trying to be as efficient as possible before. Of course, they could also dramatically ramp up nuclear energy production but that’s a not going to happen with the Greens and would take years to get online even if they went down that path.That just seems like it’s a very big problem for Germany – and thus Europe – but no one seems much concerned. Maybe, I’m overestimating how much this will hurt German industry.

                    I think German industry, especially automotive, is vastly overrated. The fact that all of those electronic components are made in China may have to do with their poor reputation for electrical problems in the cars.

            Why the surprise? He has never been on our side. He probably only released what he did of the January 6 tapes to Tucker because he knew: 1) Fox would only allow the smallest amount of reality to be exposed, and so would throttle this way back after this one little hope-raising foray; 2) This would provide them with the justification to “rid themselves of this troublesome priest”,and most importantly be seen to be doing so, thereby signaling their “good doggie” status.McCarthy wants to see populist sentiments dead and buried. Neocon DeSantis, or someone like him is what he wants to see, so don’t fool yourself. The other House investigations he has permitted to go forward, quasi-peep shows into the Deep State, are only a tease to buy some time until the next set of manuevers by the UniParty come to fruition.

            As most of you know, it is futile and a waste of breath to debate with the “great liberals” of the world.Yes, they are insane and there is the whole “bio-leninism” at play with how they play the freaks, but there is something else.  Something more ingrained.Take this nasty fat guy in the video with the little pig eyes.  Obviously, a hateful and vicious individual, but the final line of his tirade is, “I give a shit about other human beings.”  He’s preaching his virtue as a means of doing harm to others; in this case sexually mutilating children as he cusses out a peaceful for simply having a sane opinion.  He may truly believe on a conscious level that he cares about others, but clearly underneath it all he *really* wants to harm others.I believe this is an evolutionary strategy for power and dominance.  Mr. Pig Eyes here may could actually be smart.  He could be a genius on computers and maybe a good fundraiser for left wing causes.  But for all his say mathematical IQ, what really animates him is harming others.  So-called liberals having always been holier-than-thou and insanely power hungry; the two go hand-in-hand.  Their psychological strategy is to drag everyone down to the level of n-words and eunuchs and then mercilessly exploit them in the name of “civil rights and equality” or somesuch shibbeloth.  It’s all deception, all lies, all the time. They’ll cut off your dick and the say, “You may now thank me for affirming your gender. . .BITCH!”Again and again.  “You may now thank me for having you eat bugs. . .thank me for being a drug and porn addict. . .thank me for saving the environment by taking all your money. . .thank me for opening the border and not being racist. . .thank me for being culturally enriched by being stabbed in the stomach on the subway. . thank me for killing your unborn kids. . .thank me for making women and children rule over you.”This is an evo-strategy as pronounced and implacable as r and K selection and exists CLEARLY in White and Jewish peoples.  I hope someday this evolutionary strategy and the people who carry it are wiped from the earth.  There is no big misunderstand or unintended consequences from good motivations with these people; THEY INTEND EVIL AND THEY ALWAYS DID.  To use their, “its who they are; it’s their values.”

        Check out this discussion/interview between Bill Kristol and Fredrick Kagan. These people are insane and will never quit. Regarding narrative, it’s bizarre (and terrifying) to watch them and to witness how they view reality.First, Kristol laughingly (but seriously) suggests that we let our pilots fly missions in Ukraine, maybe let Ukraine join NATO now so we get involved. They both definitely want the US to provide every weapon possible.Also, in Kagan’s mind, Ukraine has been a huge success. The Ukrainians are destroying the Russia military in his view, and it’ll take years to rebuild. NATO has never been stronger. He also believes that Russia will seekNo joking, Kagan’s big fear is what Russia will do after Ukraine because, he believes, they are losing so badly. Because they will be defeated so badly, they’ll come back for revenge some day by attacking Ukraine again. He also believes that Ukraine needs to take Crimea because of its strategic importance. He truly believes that Ukraine can regain most (if not all) of the territory lost so far.These guys are dangerously insane. Kagan is already looking to the US spending hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and its army after their “victory.” Naturally, his co-ethnics on Wall Street will lead that effort. Oh, and of course, the US will need to increase its own military spending. Naturally, Ukraine will join NATO.How fucking stupid are these people. Who says these things to the Russians? They are giving the Russians no choice but to take eastern Ukraine and Odessa. Russia has no choice but to completely destroy the Ukrainian military and to turn Ukraine into a landlocked, rump state that’s incapable of having a functioning economy and thus military. My god, these people are dangerous.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZGQNVxHMM

                Watching their mannerisms as they talk is instructive. It’s all just a big game for them. You can how they couldn’t care less about everyone involved, not the Ukrainians, not the Americans, not the European, not anyone (except, of course, their people).
Yeah, we all know that, but to watch their faces and how they just laugh about US pilots or troops fighting in Ukraine, it becomes so much clearer how they look at the rest of humanity. We are toys, and they really like to play with their toys.

What’s amazing is that Kristol and Kagan could be proven 100% wrong and they won’t pay any price. These people have been wrong about everything for 20+ years and nothing happens. It just goes to show how little power we have and how much power the usual suspects have.

        Great show! Notice how they start with Stalin when speaking about blood-thirsty Russian/Soviet leaders. Mention Trotsky, Kaganovich, Sverdlov, or possibly Lenin and their heads will explode like the guy in the movie Scanners. The Kagan cult has influence and/or dirt on just about everyone and are unfortunately running the show now. The problem is that they are overrated, incompetent and not very intelligent. The idea that Russians will overthrow Putin after terrorist attacks isn’t delusional, but stupid. Most normal people understand this, but the Kagan cult, who show up on talk shows crossing their legs like women and praising each other for being ‘brilliant,’ don’t have any idea. Hopefully, this bunch of vermin are eventually called out and normal minds prevail.

        Talking about bombing cities with no military importance, it’s tough to admit Chomsky was right that the United States is fundamentally a terrorist state. Of course, his reasons was because he hates white people and now he’s changed his tune.
It shouldn’t be a surprise that’s their go-to in Ukraine, as we’ve been doing this for over 100 years.

            There are a lot of folks who were right about Iraq 20 years ago who are now taking jabs, flying rainbow flags, and shouting slava ukraini. Then there are folks like me who were wrong 20 years ago and God willing won’t get fooled again. Curious to look at. Somehow they resisted the mind virus then, but are in its thrall now. Some of this is explained just by partisan politics (many of the same folks would have been gung ho to conquer Iraq if it had been a D president doing it), but partisan politics doesn’t explain all of it.

        So let’s play armchair general for a minute and try to stand in Gerasimov’s shoes. He knows that the Kagan Cult will escalate relentlessly trying to get Russia to take the bait and overreact, which theoretically would justify a NATO reaction; or failing that, give Brandon cover to send in some token US military force (Vietnam redux). The ultimate escalation would likely involve a false-flag nuclear or dirty bomb explosion somewhere in Ukraine that kills a lot of innocents. In the fevered minds of the Kaganistas, this produces sufficient public outrage at Russia to justify a US military retaliatory nuclear strike and then its turtles all the down to nuclear Armageddon. Since this is a non-optimum outcome, what is the safest and most efficient solution to this problem?First question – what is the root of the problem? From whence does this suicidal insanity originate?Second question – What is the most efficient way to neutralize the root problem without killing lots of innocents or resorting to nuclear Armageddon?Third question – if the fate of the planet is at stake, does it really matter if you piss off Dan Bongino?

            In the not too distant past we had some adults in the room involved in the system.  Maybe not too many but some.  One can’t see any now.   When the average guy in the street could do a better job of foreign policy management than any of the people running the show we are in terrible trouble.Any of us on this forum knows that no one is going to win a nuclear conflict.   Everyone here knows that  how a nuclear exchange would go is impossible to predict except massive destruction and death.    The Russians have stated such over and over.   Yet the Kagan Cult and most of the U.S. Government seems completely OK with nukes flying.There is no analyzing this mass psychosis.

        You’d think even Zelensky would figure the hourglass is running low and he’d surreptitiously sneak off the stage to somewhere at least moderately safe.  His problem, is of course, there is no place he can probably get to where he won’t be found out sooner or later – he’ll be looking over his shoulder night and day.  Further, I doubt he’s made of the sterner stuff who could even semi thrive in that kind of scenario.  He made a deal with the DC devil and it’ll more likely than not be the end of him one way or another.

            There is this talk of reforming the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and letting it absorb western Ukraine.  That would effectively get Zelensky off the hook and safely to his Italian villa with a few $billion in the bank.  It also shifts the proxy war to Poland without the rest of NATO.  Russia has to spend another year grinding the Polish Army down to dust.

                    Leaving aside  my contempt for Ukrainians, the Poles and whatever the Baltic states call themselves have proven that none of them deserve their own country. They’re only fit to be ruled by others who can keep their worst instincts supressed.

                    The Germans were planning on using Poland as an ally in their war against the Soviets. They turned west because France upheld its treaty commitments to Poland.
The British were not the primary drivers of that unpleasant scenario. The Germans were desperate to have a huge war in Europe regardless of Churchill and the Poles.

What it looks like is a desperate, failed attempt to destroy the Russian flag flying above the dome, because while the Russians win their wars on the battlefield, “our” side wants a Twitter victory to keep their Perpetually Online propagandists and their followers happy.

            I’m sure the “attack on the Kremlin” was supposed to demonstrate that “Russia is weak” because they can’t keep people from doing this right in the capitol. My suspicion is that this was the work of freelance terrorists hired on something like Upwork or Fiver, hell maybe literally that. Could the US stop the Russians from doing the same? Probably not. They haven’t and won’t though precisely because they are not Twitterniks and understand the difference between propaganda victory and real victory as you pointed out.If anything it reinforced my suspicion that the US “military-industrial complex” is now more of a “scam-hobbyshop complex” where clever people with some technical ability figure out how to line their pockets pulling capers and selling “anti-gravity rocket boots” to clueless government officials who can write big checks. The money is very real, everything else… Well, hang on, I’ll get back to you once my next shipment of rocket boots comes in. I’ll need a down payment to hold them for you of course.

        “it appears this stunt was done with the admin being told”“With” or “without?” I lean toward the latter. The United States has a wide-open border and soft targets, after all. It is one thing to impoverish the serfs, another to put the nomenklatura at risk.I suspect the vast majority of war-related actions are done ad hoc by private actors and contractors. Not only does “Biden” have no obvious input most of the time, but the buffoons in his Administration also are window dressing. All stops are being pulled to prevent the war from being a 2024 campaign issue, hence the censorship and arrests of domestic political opponents. If this drags on and Team Biden does not declare victory and skedaddle, it will indicate the “Administration” has no input whatsoever into the matter since everything else they do is totally political.As for Zelensky, the bullet will be put into him either from the front or from the back. It is a coin flip. It is tough to decide whether Putin or “Biden” will make the kill shot.Finally, every time I think this may end without a nuclear exchange, the Neocons disabuse me of the notion. James Cagney’s line “look at me, ma, I’m on top of the world” is on loop in my head now.

            “Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government’s Secret Plan to Save Itself–While the Rest of Us Die”
Great easy read about the declassified plans and facilities US Gov had in place to survive and thrive after a nuclear war.
TLDR; You’d better believe our current government is convinced THEY’D survive a nuclear response.

            Right now, it looks like this was done without the inner circle knowing about it. The Pentagon also seemed unprepared for it, but they were cut out of the Nord Stream attack too, if the Hersh reporting is accurate. They may just be better at playing dumb.I agree that war policy is increasingly done outside official circles. Blinken, Sullivan and Nuland conspire with the rest of the cult, but they keep the rest of the administration in the dark. What the Pentagon knows probably comes from their surveillance of the cult. I would bet that a private security firm surveils the cult members for their friends in the Pentagon.

                    I think a better question might be who does the books.Re a short quip (my comment didn’t go thru), for instance, the accounting for NGO boats that bring “refugees” and their rubber rafts to 10 miles offshore for the hired cameras, or the US govt buses and buildout of the Darien Gap.We’re seeing a global industry, a sector, that doesn’t count costs of goods sod or bottom line profits.This leads me to realize that even the participants aren’t in charge; they’re superceded by the system they are part of.In other words, a culture.  Not a corporation, or party, or country defined by a specific charter, as the US was.Its own accounting, economics, religious values, dialect, even opportunity ladder- for instance, the Murdochs value their standing in that culture more than money.  Its strange games make no sense to Boomer capitalists, such as promising $800M to Dominion rather than buying out Dominion the $40M its worth (brilliant catch, that one.)A cult sounds right.  Led by its Kagans, true, but a parallel culture running concurrently.

                There likely is quite a bit of tension between the Pentagon and Langley, from the outlines we see, so it would make sense for the military to keep Club Kagan under surveillance via private contractors and informants. We are seeing the factions start to go at each other from time to time now. This will get worse as the GAE recedes. I agree that Blinken, Sullivan and Nuland personally have wildly outsized input into what is happening and that is why they were inserted into their positions in the first place, but ultimately the National Security State is in control and they do as told.Kind of a non-sequitur, but the on again, off again “news” coverage has corresponded directly with the situation on the ground. If things are going well for the Ukrainians, there is lots of coverage, and when the tide goes turns against them, silence. The coordination between the propagandists and the National Security State has been remarkable and amazing to watch (or not watch, if Russia is advancing).

        I hadn’t heard anything at all of the drone attack on the Kremlin.
I’ll consider that ignorance as a small victory in war on “the news”.
I’ve been trying to ignore the noos for more than a year now.  Which is actually amazingly difficult because the propaganda is so pervasive. Even if I avoid direct engagement someone throws it at me –what do you think about …ordid you hear about….
