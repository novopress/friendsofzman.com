        They want to prop Biden up for at least two years so that Kamala can have two full terms after that.  If she fills out more than half his term she can only get one more after that.

        Biden is a pitiable senior citizen with severe dementia and the victim of elder abuse. I doubt that he even remembers that he was selected to be president by the Deep State, who continue to use his animated corpse as a mascot for their successful coup.Biden is not the problem (much like Trump was never the problem nor the solution). The root problem is that we now have a charade masquerading as a federal government, and that is no trivial thing. The stooge in the Oval Office is nominally the pinnacle of a military command structure that controls the most powerful weapons on the planet. Since everyone knows that Biden can‚Äôt tie his shoes, let alone make a critical command decision, then WHO is calling the shots now? This is not a game of insults. This is life &amp; death if some foreign tyrant decides that now is the best time to strike.

        Biden‚Äôs dementia is a feature and not a bug for his puppeteer. They are looting as fast as they can, and don‚Äôt need to be slowed with questions. They fully expect to lose the House even with their fraud machine intact come 2022, and they are making hay while the sun shines.
They‚Äôll just slither off the second half of The  Pretender‚Äôs term and could give a shit less who plays Max Headroom at that point. A full implosion is expected and considered irrelevant.

        Not that ‚Äúrules‚Äù matter anymore, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone speculate on the effect of WHEN Joe goes. IIRC, if Kamala serves less than 2 years, she can run again twice, totally 10 years (if she runs/wins), otherwise the first 2 years + 1day counts as a first term. Eg, Truman couldn‚Äôt run again in 1952, after replacing FDR in 1945. I believe this was discussed re: Ford/Nixon as well. The point being that Kamala would likely want to have Joe serve at least 2 full years to give her a chance at the maximum possible time in office, or else they‚Äôd have to sweeten the deal. If Joe goes sooner that might upset those plans.

            They‚Äôd probably like to be able to prop up Joe through 2022, but I don‚Äôt think that will be doable.  My curiosity is who gets the VP slot when Harris gets the big office?For a couple of reasons, the Dems must be seriously reviewing their shelf stock to see what ‚Äúwinners‚Äù they have that they can roll out.  Good luck with that.  But, they do have that great ‚Äúelection protection program‚Äù that Joe mentioned.

                My early money would be on them going the sodomite route and choosing Mayor Buttplug.
Last night I saw a pop up ad on my computer for P&amp;G tampons (not sure what the brand name was) that featured (((Amy Schumer))) demonstrating on a jelly donut how to insert a tampon.  As a punchline, she then ate the donut.  So they actually get off on shoving their degeneracy in our faces.  That‚Äôs why I think they‚Äôll insist on the Veep being an ankle scratcher.

                Rich;Or maybe TPTB plan to sell the office to the highest bidder.  IIRC, after Nero offed himself, the Roman Senate decided to sell the office of Emperor.  Worked twice until a general with some provincial legions ruined their game by marching on Rome, proclaimed himself Caesar and proscribed the ringleaders.

            Your speculation has been mentioned elsewhere and is as good as anyone‚Äôs, however, Kamala would then be running as a ‚Äútwo‚Äù or ‚Äúthree‚Äù term President essentially.  Given the short favorability span of presidents after Clinton, a third term run might put her and the party at a disadvantage right off the bat.  On the other hand, the flaw in that thought is that elections mean anything after the rigged last election.

            First off no one likes Kamala. Secondly she is grossly incompetent and no world leader would take her seriously.She‚Äôs just a whore and that‚Äôs it.Look the elites made a terrible mistake, they thought Biden would be good for at least 3 years after holding his own with Trump in the debates. Problem is dementia progresses non linearly. So now we have a mumbling and stumbling half-wit just 2 months in office. At the current rate he‚Äôll be gone by July.Kamala cannot be installed. She radiates weakness. Xi, Putin, Shortstack and the towel heads would just laugh at her and do as they please. I suspect she will resign after the elites pick another stooge. She is at best a placeholder. If they keep her as POTUS, it will be a disaster.The elites chose badly `and now they will pay for it.

        ‚ÄúThe lesson here is that politics is never about planning. It is about opportunity. This is true regardless of the political system. Politics is about human behavior and people are too irrational to fit into a plan. Good politics is always being prepared to take a bite out of the other side and boost your side. Sometimes, that means working with people you hate, which is what the Democrats should have done with Trump. It is a lesson dissidents should keep in mind as the Biden story unfolds this summer.‚ÄùIn other words, we should start working together with Antifa? I‚Äôm at the point now that I‚Äôd be willing to work with anyone to bring down the managerial state.

            If we work with the management state, they will simply subvert our side and render it useless by virtue of their wealth and connections.. Just like they did with the TeaParty, Reform Party.
Once people realize the system is totally corrupt and against them, they will be no mood to listen to the people who destroyed our country.
They really deserve to be fed to feral hogs feet first.
We need to start with a clean slate.

        They‚Äôre going to pump him full of drugs like they did Brezhnev and roll his walking corpse out to kiss babies. I guess, if anything, he‚Äôs finally paying for his life of corruption and greed, living a hell of being pumped full of drugs and not enjoying the twilight years of his life.

            It doesn‚Äôt work on dementia patients. Biden will be gone by August.All they can do is pump him full of Ativan to keep him from going bananas on stage. But it also turns him into a zombie. As it progresses they will have to tie him down to a bed as he screams and moans until he dies.I‚Äôve watched loved ones go this route and seen others in LTCF‚Äôs that are little more  than screaming piles of flesh tied to a bed.  You‚Äôre only hope is that they pass quickly before they reach that point.I really don‚Äôt wish this fate on anyone. It‚Äôs that awful.

        ‚ÄúThey live to undermine the rules and subvert the natural order, but they have never been very good at running things.‚ÄùThis is so very true. Note that postmodernism (or, more accurately, poststructuralism) is the intellectual foundation of AWR ideology, and that pomo, first and foremost, is about subverting the western tradition of reasoned truth-seeking, undermining Christian morality, and advocating transgression in every sphere of human existence. To the extent this project succeeds, Western civilization goes up in smoke and ash. But what, pray tell, replaces it? Ah. In that area the pomos and their political catspaws are very vague. And they are vague because, in their dead souls, they believe in nothing.

            I do wonder what ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù Jill‚Äôs internal thoughts are.  She must know of her husband‚Äôs situation, yet she does everything to prop him up.
My guess is that she is a true believer in wokeness and sees herself as a soldier for the cause with a special mission:  to do whatever is necessary for her side to win.
I wish we had more of that attitude on our side.
If the cause requires that she carry his corpse around while a ventriloquist speaks for dead Joe offstage, she will.

        Personally, I think the Q hoax was largely orchestrated by Google and Youtube.  The conspiracy bloomed on Youtube especially for years.  Seems to me that they were likely behind it.  But still, I wonder who actually created all that Q content?  It was vastly more developed and interactive than any other online conspiracy theory I have ever seen, which partly made it more credible.  Tom Hanks even spoofed the conspiracy theory when he appeared on SNL last year and did skits about pizza with typewriters in the background suchlike.  Doesn‚Äôt seem believable to me that so many people on the left were playing up their deep state satanic pedophile personalities without being ‚Äúin on it‚Äù.  Anyways‚Ä¶  all of that is just by way of saying this:  Gen. Mike Flynn should answer questions about this topic.  Even a week before Jan 6th I watched a video where he said there was a 10 out of 10 chance that Trump would be inaugurated.  Why would he say that when it turned out to be completely false?  And why isn‚Äôt anyone holding his feet to the fire and making him explain what exactly he was thinking when he promoted the Q conspiracy stuff.  Millions of people were deeply deceived by all of that to the point that we are now being called Terrorists.  I feel like this was a set up meant to discredit white people as voters and it was orchestrated by the Democrats and Mike Flynn was in on it to.  He should definitely have remained in jail because of all of this.  I loathe him now.

            It was an organic conspiracy theory promoted by grifters ‚Äî certain gammas if you know who I‚Äôm referring to ‚Äî and low IQ attention seekers on platforms with tremendous reach. No further conspiracy is required to explain it. Stupid people posted things that other stupid people saw and then believed on platforms with wide reach.Millions of people are simply imbeciles not capable of rational thought. A certain gamma claimed Trump‚Äôs concession speech was deepfake rather than give up the conspiracy. He spent years relating various ‚ÄúQ Proofs‚Äù uncritically taken from 4chan and Reddit. No matter how many times this guy was disproved, he kept it up. By the end, he was demanding Trump ‚ÄúCross the Rubicon‚Äù as a last desperate move to save his conspiracy. He wasn‚Äôt alone. The Capitol Hill Protest was frequented with lots of deluded people in denial. Low IQ, but desperate people, have a tendency to see connections in things were there are none.These types of conspiracies have always existed and never before needed another conspiracy to explain them. Rapture cults were common in 19th century America and Millennial cults were prevalent in the run up to the year 2000 (Heaven‚Äôs Gate). Both were the result of simple-mined, fearful people who lacked the intellect or character to question charlatans in their midst.No one was tricked if they had a superior intellect and strength of character. People were tricked because they aren‚Äôt very smart or because they don‚Äôt have the character to withstand the ultimate black pill: America as you once knew it is over. Normies know something is wrong, but they can‚Äôt admit it or even address the problem if they did because they lack the requisite talent and psychology to change things. Thus, they embraced a salvation cult in a desperate attempt to believe the future will be okay for them.The left has millions of their own desperate morons. We saw that with Russiagate. White Leftists are scared of brown minorities taking away their money and neighborhoods. The brainwashing prevents them from seeing the real sources of their anxiety, so they project onto mythical Russian agents and ‚Äúwhite supremacists‚Äù subverting their utopia, the thing that their flawed ideology was supposed to give us but somehow didn‚Äôt. This also explains cancel culture. These Leftists (formerly left-wing, now fascists ‚Äî thus Leftist), can‚Äôt admit their ideology is flawed, so they have to go to ever greater lengths to square the circle: banning books, trigger warnings, mob attacks on fantasy counter revolutionaries, etc. This has already lead to violence, which I expect the left to continue escalating because they will never wound their egos by admitting they were wrong; like the Soviets, they will blame outside forces (and take extreme steps to combat these fantasy forces) rather than admit failure on their part.Remember, democracy is rule by these types. Maybe a separation is in order before they can do anything worse.

                    I too believed there were a bunch of indictments forthcoming soon‚Ä¶ for a couple of years.  üôÇAt the time, in the thick of the action, it all seemed completely true to me:  Hilary was a superwitch in charge of a satanic coven where John Podesta routinely sacrificed children to Baal.  I still think that‚Äôs all actually true honestly.But, why no indictments of higher level people for conspiring to smear trump with fake Russian intelligence and similar sorts of topics?  It‚Äôs just mind boggling that the left/deep state has won, consolidated their control over the media, locked down the country and started pushing for tranny rights and socialism and literally no one stood up against it.In the context of that, why exactly did we need to fight a war in Vietnam or destroy the Soviet Union?  We didn‚Äôt.  It was all always a cash grab.The truth about the Q conspiracy should be exposed in more depth.  I don‚Äôt buy that it was just a bunch rubes who got duped.  Psychological warfare is real.  We were subjected to it.  We lost.

                        I suspect it was a  hot button issue created by some PR outfit. Why? Because it distracted a lot of Trump supporters from real issues affecting them. Outsourcing, China dumping Fentanyl into the U.S. open borders, dying middle-class, banks and wall Street benefiting from QE while ordinary people went broke, etc.See after 2017 Trump stopped talking about these issues and the last thing TPTB wanted was those issues to be on the fore of public consciousness again. And what better way to keep people distracted than something like Qanon.Today no one talks about these issues outside of a few people like Jimmy Dore.

        What happens when an empire is essentially leaderless? Weak leadership usually portends fracturing / disintegration from my reading of history. Is there anyone at all on the left or right of the political spectrum that has even a hint of leadership potential?  How can Putin or Xi take anyone representing the US seriously? It must be frightening to them, like seeing a cement truck driven by a cab full of drooling retards driving through your neighborhood. It would be more irresponsible not to act than to intervene.

            They will sit back and watch those imbeciles destroy the empire and then collect the pieces.This is the end result of destroying the farm system used to bring up fresh talent for the parties.  For the last 30 years the benches have been empty. It happens to parties when the current leadership decides to pull up the ladder so as to insure no competition for their seat.It started with the Clintons who turned the Dem party into their personal fiefdom until Trump put them out to pasture. By then the damage was done. The party had no one of gravitas just freaks  and morons like AOC,  Buttplugs and Beto. None of their mayors were worth a shitThe GOP died long before that when it became a puppet for globalists under the Bush family who essentially ran the party until  2008. After that the GOP became irrelevant.

                Is it safe to sit back and watch? I wish I knew more about what really happened as the USSR disintegrated with regard to how much the US interfered. They must have at least demanded verifiable reassurances about control of nuclear weapons. I remember some of the public interactions but I‚Äôm sure that was probably all pantomime. During the Clinton admin we paid them to decommission. Under the Obama admin the Clintons got paid to arrange for their importation of our uranium hahaha. It‚Äôs so crazy it is hard to believe. I think Z‚Äôs analogy to our situation being a gangster bust-out of the whole country is the best way to think of it all.

        I‚Äôm seeing 1/6 as a metaphor for Trump‚Äôs entire presidency.  He and a deplorable mob were poised to force their way in.   Those in charge threw up their hands, ‚Äòwelp, let him in‚Äô.  He strutted in, was led politely between the velvet ropes, sat in an important chair, took selfies and posted on social media.   When he had outworn his welcome, the zookeepers said, ‚ÄòOk, it‚Äôs time to leave‚Äô, and he allowed himself to be ushered out.     (Ashli and Kyle are the country in this scenario, btw.)

            I can‚Äôt imagine that is true. The Trump years showed that direct subordinates of the Executive can defy orders with no consequences. Whoever is actually running things would pat him on the head and send him back to his playroom to finish his watercoloring.

                Don‚Äôt be so sure. In the old days this would have been considered treason. Have we really come to the point where the whole chain of command has been broken? Who does have the power to say launch? This secret cabal, with a wink, a nod, and a large money transfer could, without fear of retaliation, turn over Taiwan to the CCP. Anything is possible anymore.

                    Treason is now simply carrying out some act the regime deems to be in contravention of their immediate interests. Again, the Trump years alone demonstrate irrefutably that there is no objective definition of either Treason or Rioting or Insurrection. There is no law we have all agreed to governed by, there is no representative government to make the laws for that matter, there is only force. Force without legitimacy and government without the consent of the governed. They surround the capitol with soldiers because they fear the opposition will act as they have acted. Since they do not recognize the results of an ‚Äúelection‚Äù if they fail to prevail, they foresee the possibility of the same response.

        The more Trump attacks Biden,the more the Dems have to keep Biden in,lest they look like they are caving to Trump by retiring Biden.  They will have to keep crowing about Biden, keep Kamala on the sidelines, for as long as Trump keeps mocking and ridiculing Biden.  Can‚Äôt admit to anyone that their main man is a doddering old fool, especially when they just spent 4 years saying Trump was incompetant.  Trump is in a strong position.

        Things aren‚Äôt going to get better for the people in charge here, because while Biden is a clown, he is sort of a bathetic, tragicomic type (outlived some of his children; one of his sons is a crackhead). He has some residual love from people who still want to believe the working class Irish-Catholic white democrat can return. The idea that the democrats have any interest in normal white people (or normalcy, period) is just the ghost of an echo at this point, but nostalgia is powerful stuff. But the woman coming in, whom Biden probably calls Vice Pina Colada Harris, is hated by too many people for even a very hard sell, Phillip Dick-style psy-op to convince anyone that she is popular. The polls and puff pieces will only work on the unhinged, and will disgust yellow dog democrats. Black women set the agenda for the black community, and they hate light-skinned bitches like Harris. Your average black dude looks at her and thinks she looks like the kind of high yellow who sat on the porch drinking mint julips and would warn Massa when one of the field hands was making a break for it from the cotton field. Black people are still at the bottom of society but they‚Äôre also still very important to the DNC coalition. Hispanics just don‚Äôt really get energized to vote once they‚Äôve snuck in. Unlike blacks, they‚Äôre not content with someone who just sort of looks like them. And honestly if someone like Hugo Chavez was to run for president here I‚Äôd vote for him just to hear Ben Shapiro mewl about socialism.

        I don‚Äôt think the Democrats‚Äô attitude to government is in any way similar to that of the GOP. Sure, they‚Äôre a bunch of paranoid freaks out to rob us blind. But there‚Äôs a fundamental difference. The leftists who fund and direct the Democrats are out for REAL blood. They are looking for a final solution. Not the Stupid Party. Most Republicans treat the Democrats as the loyal opposition in the face of facts that are contrary to that assumption. For example, look at the Democrat voting legislation they just passed in the House. That legislation would lock in fraudulent elections into infinity. Instead of calling this wicked attempt at subversion what it really is, you have the usual GOP shills sounding off about its being ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù. As if the Left gives a shit. So long as our side simply runs around smugly confident in its moral superiority and legal acumen, we stand no chance against an aggressive enemy that cares nothing for either morals or laws. We must level the playing field.

                Your first three sentences sound like a summary of recent Nietzsche I‚Äôm reading (‚ÄúAntichrist‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Genealogy of Morals‚Äù). Civilization, or Christianity in some places, was an attempt by the weak to subdue the wild, free man, his Ubermensch (I guess, I‚Äôm still new at this‚Ä¶). In fact, one of his main topics in ‚ÄúGenealogy‚Äù is the origin of ‚ÄúBad conscience.‚Äù If I understand him, the bad conscience is the once-free man‚Äôs need for freedom (alas, the urge to hurt others often times), constrained by civilization (Christianity), turned inward, so that it causes internal problems.Now, speaking personally, I like civilization. I‚Äôm probably more a sheep than a wolf, except rhetorically perhaps. I understand (not from Nietzsche) that civilization has been defined as Man‚Äôs rebellion against Nature: we‚Äôd like some things to not be as harsh, pitiless, as final, as default existence will produce, so we try to devise structures to mitigate or alter them. I get that Nietzsche champions the superior man, who lives by his own code, free of the oppression of others. The maverick, the champion, the leader, certainly has a place in myth and even history. But what I still can‚Äôt see that he‚Äôs distinguished is: how does his hero, Zarathustra, differ from primitive man? If he is really running around doing as he pleases, the consequences to others be damned, is he actually any different than today‚Äôs criminal running around, stealing, robbing, raping, assaulting, murdering? I, as yet, have not seen him make any such distinction. Civilization was put in place, at least in part, to restrain the wild beast so that the sheep could graze in relative safety.But Nietzsche has a point. Civilization (and its partner, religion) can go too far in protecting the weak. If those who would have been the conquerors, the strong, in primitive times, are sufficiently hobbled, then yes, it is the victory of the weak over the strong.

                    Yep. Current events have had me remembering Nietzsche.
He might‚Äôve been as crazy as he sometimes sounds, idk, but I read him as an artist more so than a philosopher. Which is to say, his writing is a gut punch instead of a thesis. He wants people to embrace and affirm life. Also, he was a product of the Victorian age, so I can forgive him for being polemical, shocking, superficially dyscivilizational.
Nut or not, there‚Äôs a lot in his writing that‚Äôs useful today.

                        He‚Äôs one of the all-time pop culture gadfly douchebags, but ‚ÄúSports Guy‚Äù Bill Simmons deserves our thanks for coming up with the concept of the ‚ÄúTyson Zone.‚Äù That‚Äôs when a celebrity like Mike Tyson has such a long track record of bizarre behavior, you‚Äôre forced to at least momentarily consider if stories that would be obvious over-the-top parodies about anyone else just might be true (basically, Poe‚Äôs Law for celebrities). I think Joe Biden is maybe three attempted ‚Äúpress conferences‚Äù away from the Tyson Zone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and this man is at least nominally the President of the United States.

        They had a real conundrum.  Could rig election laws enough to get Bernie in.  The rest were zeros.  I‚Äôm guessing the bad bet they made was assuming Alzheimers progression is linear‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not.  The guy is a mess and can barely ‚Äúgrip‚Äù a teleprompter for a five minute canned speech.  My bet is Jill (Edith Wilson in this reprise) is one of the barriers.  But it explains the acceleration of EOs, fortifying the Capitol, moving immediately to persecution of the right.  Their window is much narrower than Obama, who could at least talk his own book when he got off his ass.  The Green Zone is not there for happened, it‚Äôs there for what will come.

            His decline has been very rapid since the last debate with Trump. At this rate he‚Äôll have to be kept in seclusion by June. After that it just gets increasingly ugly for Pelsoi and crew.Funny thing about the Green Zone. Is that D.C. hates the NG troops. Seems the vendors supplying them with food have been poisoning them with moldy bread, uncooked meat, etc. A bunch has to go to the hospital and now they are forced to eat MRE‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt trust the food suppliers. First they get treated like animals and put in a unheated garage, forced to sleep on the floor and only one bathroom for a battalion worth of men.WTF is wrong with the Pentagon and D.C. authorities that they are unable to provide the men with decent accommodations and food?

                It‚Äôs likely just a combination of corruption and incompetence.Corruption in the sense that these companies skimp on things like cooking the food to save on the cost of making it, probably expecting to throw away most of it before the deception is discovered; probably 99% of many products are thrown away before use and upon reaching the expiration date, so there is little risk of being caught (and if you are, just claim it was an error and promise to fix it). It‚Äôs the equivalent of selling lower grade gasoline as a higher grade one: most people won‚Äôt notice and you‚Äôll make lots of money by selling a lower cost item for a premium.Incompetence in the sense that the government requires diversity quotas in contracts, so the quality of items often depends upon meeting social engineering requirements.This is why I expect China to surprise us all one day and crush the US military. We‚Äôll go to war and suddenly find a large fraction of missiles, sensitive technologies, and even basic things like MREs are defective. Think it can‚Äôt happen? It already has.Remember that story about UFOs being caught on camera by the US Navy? The truth is that there were no UFOs. The IR cameras were simply defective. The story that was floated to the public was just a cover to avoid potential prosecution of the executives involved and a decline in share price; selling expensive, but defective, equipment to the military could be criminal. This kind of thing happens all the time.

Most of them seem to be dumb as dirt and there would be more a chance of one them literally shooting themselves in the foot than shooting anybody else.

                    Dino;Yeah, epic level stupidity on display in DC.  More than a few kings and emperors met their deaths from abusing their bodyguards just because they could: Until one day they couldn‚Äôt.
Just a preview of how DC Statehood will go.  Used to be, a no-bid contract would go to a diversity-owned shell company who would sub-contract to somebody actually capable of doing the work.  Apparently they are now so stupid and greedy that they have done away with Step 2.
And why not_?  After all, they‚Äôll get re-elected anyway.  But this ain‚Äôt the same as (not) paving the potholes.

                The news report I read mentioned metal shavings. Now uncooked or spoiled food I can understand, but metal shavings is hard to accidentally get into food. I suspect deliberate sabotage. Yes, MREs or canned food they open themself will be safer. If I‚Äôm right, this actually works for our side: the military knows that even in the capital city, the citizenry hates them or more likely, is a bunch of incompetents,  and the government they are sworn to serve isn‚Äôt much better.

            The DNC went out of their way w/ constant rule changes to keep the likes of Bernie (also Tulsi) from getting anywhere near the nomination.

                I don‚Äôt think it is all that clear as to which camp she is in. Her campaign staff was all Clinton people. Her money was from Silicon Valley. Biden has a mix of Obama people and Washington careerists. I tend to think Harris was the choice because she was assumed to have no future of her own. Biden would stagger through his first term, maybe quit in year three and then there would be a big fight to see who is the 2024 nominee.That‚Äôs what will be fun to watch. As Biden fades, these people will be ripping each other‚Äôs throats out in public.

                        We can chuckle with amusement, gentlemen, but a lot of bad stuff may well happen. Drunken sailor scale spending (of course it happened and would have happened the same if the prior tenant had extended his lease). But we will see additional crimps on freedom. National firearms registration a la California (Felony to not report ownership of arms?)  or at least recording of all sales. Additional muzzles on law enforcement, free speech. No action taking against the tech oligarchy. Solar panels, wind mills, and electric cars for everybody.

                    I always though cunning implied intelligence, but I was wrong. Its definition only requires ‚Äúshrewd, sly, deceiving, crafty‚Äù. Nietzsche agrees (Genealogy of Morals, essay 1, ch. 15):
(‚ÄúInjury makes a man cunning,‚Äù says a popular proverb: so far as it makes him cunning, it makes him also bad. Fortunately, often enough makes him stupid).

                She‚Äôs VP because she‚Äôs unlikeable and has zero institutional or popular support. Because she‚Äôs in line after Biden, it ensures insiders won‚Äôt undermine Biden‚Äôs claim to the presidency because the alternative is unworkable. Basically, party leaders are doing what they can to keep Biden propped up by making sure that lesser powers (Pelosi, Etc.)  will cooperate with Biden so they don‚Äôt ever have to deal with Harris. Biden is the carrot; harris is the stick.

                    Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein did the same thing. He appointed some Christians to high level positions in his government knowing they couldn‚Äôt threaten him because they weren‚Äôt Muslim and the population would never accept them as leaders if they tried anything. The only choice they had, no matter how much they hated the guy, was to keep Saddam around because the alternatives were unacceptable. This kind of thing is common in history.

            If the Trump/Biden presidencies have accomplished anything, it‚Äôs that the President has virtually no control of the branch he supposedly is in charge of.

                That more or less been the case with presidents for decades.Obama was more a spiritual leader for the bureaucracy than an actual boss.Trump was continuously undermined from day one and never willing to go scorched earth on them.  Ultimately, the beat him.Bush was a dope that they led around by the nose.Clinton seams to have had some limited control.Poppa Bush was figure head that presided over their expansion.Reagan was a sort of boss that cough them and that they hated and wanted to dump.  But he was too smooth an operator for them to beat.  He won on foreign policy but it was a draw domestically.

No borders, no unity, no social trust. Bribable low IQ voters, auto-elected corruptocrats, vicious cycle. Federal fiscal insanity, worthless fiat money, eventual economic collapse. More desperation, more crime, more police state repression. Chaos, martial law, rise of autocracy. More awareness of systemic malfunction, more Big Brother spying, more persecution of the sane. Rapidly growing parasitism, declining productive class, tipping point. City life, high mortality, panic-fueled exodus to safety. Well-planned refuge, survival, resurrection of the fit.

                There was apparently a scene in one of Terry Pratchett‚ÄôsDiscworldbooks (I‚Äôve only had it relayed to me second hand) about a fellow who was innovating the concept of fire insurance in that fantasy universe, but hadn‚Äôt quite perfected it.
Insurance Salesman: ‚ÄúYes, he pays me a premium monthly and the policy pays him [some amount of money] should his tavern burn down!‚Äù
Man: ‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre basically saying that you bet him [some amount of money] that his tavern won‚Äôt burn down?‚Äù

            Bilejones. Forgive me, sir, but something you mentioned about the CDC on yesterday‚Äôs thread piqued my interest. Your words were something to the effect (please clarify if I‚Äôm off base) of ‚Äòthe CDC had not isolated a sample of the virus‚Äô, what does this mean? Did you have any links to the statement that was made confirming this?This lunchtime, after strolling with the wife through a pleasant green wood with zero diversity, I thought I‚Äôd have a gander at the CDC‚Äôs website. I found an explanation of the two ways of testing for the ChinkyPox and both seemed likely to yield false positives. The first, seemingly more accurate, was called a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) and apparently detects ‚Äòvirus genetic material‚Äô. The second, not very accurate is an antigen test which detects ‚Äòviral proteins‚Äô. I wonder if it is this second test that is administered most frequently? If so, it appears that the number of false positives could be considerable.I suppose it was just another reminder, to this layman, how shrouded in mystery this whole business is. The Argentina article seems quite terrifying. There was a gentleman commenting here awhile back living as an expat in Argentina, I wonder what his thoughts are on this.

                Here‚Äôs the damning paragraphPageAnalytical Performance:Limit of Detection (LoD):LoD studies determine the lowest detectable concentration of 2019-nCoV at which approximately 95% of all (true positive) replicates test positive. The LoD was determined by limiting dilution studies using characterized samples.The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies. Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/ŒºL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPath‚Ñ¢ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied Biosystems‚Ñ¢ 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use.On page 39 of this document dated  7/13/2020CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic PanelFor Emergency Use OnlyInstructions for UseCatalog # 2019-nCoVEUA-011000 reactionsFor In-vitro Diagnostic (IVD) UseRx OnlyCentered on the actual front page of course.It was updated/rewritten  in December and that Para was gone but they nowhere claim to have samples.I took the precaution of downloading it and will happily send you the 50 odd page PDF.

                    Thanks. This is the sort of stuff I mean. If these people have no samples for there LoD tests, then Joe Bloggs is correct to ask questions. One such question is why a virus with so many cases reported is one that the premier research institute in AINO has no samples of.
It‚Äôs also a great example of some worrying truths buried in plain sight, dressed up with some scientific terminology to scare people off. Works, I suppose.

                        Let‚Äôs not get too far into conspiracy land. Viruses exist. Yes, there is plenty of uncertainty and misinformation about SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The pandemic has been exploited more, perhaps, than any other disease in modern history. Perhaps all history.But anyone who says ‚Äúno one has ever proven that the virus exists‚Äù or some similar statement is not well informed and frankly, probably wears  a tinfoil hat. Not only do viruses exist, but they can be bred, sequenced, sliced and diced, combined with unrelated viruses, in short, manipulated with almost the same ease as a document on a word processor. The gene sequences of viruses are routinely decoded and stored in publicly-available databases (and probably secret ones, too.)All these are routinely done for research purposes and have been for decades. There is a chance, perhaps a good one, that SARS-CoV-2 is a lab experiment that escaped. I have no opinion on whether SARS-CoV-2 has inserts from the HIV virus. But it‚Äôs certainly possible. I‚Äôve seen academic research about doing such stuff (they call it a ‚Äúpseudovirus‚Äù).It is even possible to synthesize a virus from its genetic code in the database, although I don‚Äôt think this is normally done, due to expense.
