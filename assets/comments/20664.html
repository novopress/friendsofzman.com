        The woke members of this generation have been the richest proles in the history of the world. They have no real concept of what poverty and misery are actually like. They probably believe that when their efforts are rewarded things will return to a kind of  normality that includes their being in charge of the redistribution of the wealth. Sadly, there won’t be any wealth to redistribute until they’re returned to subservience.

                Probably not before you though, because they are will to do any debasement necessary to survive, like all cowards in history.So while you aren’t wrong they are necessary now from a numbers perspective to usher in the new Theocratic Government of Woke which is what the Democratic party will be renamed to soon. Then it will be Uniparty and Big Brotha in perpetuity after that.

                    Revolution devours its children. The woke whites will be first, because they will be seen as competition and/or not reliable.The ones who kept their heads down will be ignored or allowed to exile.

                It is clear that my liberal friends subconsciously believe that while I will be forced to live in a teepee, without electricity or combustion, that they will be granted a special pass from Obama or Al Gore to retain their heated homes and Priuses, due to their faithful service to the cause.

                Yes, constant reminder of the economic angle is a weird one here. It’s just a cope. Wealth redistributed or wealth washed away, you’re still stuck in a land full of these idiots who wish you dead.

                    Perhaps because economics will be a prime weapon of the genocide.  Get woke or lose your job and starve.  You didn’t build that business (per the sainted Obamatard); so your “partners” will confiscate their share.  And if you do get woke, be prepared for some tasty bug protein with those collard greens.  The bottom line truth is that cultural genes require economic epigenesis for their real world expression.  In other words, economics is a necessary but not sufficient efficient cause of culture.

        Well, I hate to be the guy to do the terrible-optics nasdapping, but what we’re up against is nothing less than genocidal left-wing totalitarianism.And theonlything that could counter it is some kind ofverystrong right-wing authoritarianism. We are so far off from that as to be almost laughable, while they are quickly rolling up our freedoms. We’re really underdogs at the moment.But for the many influential people who read this blog, I would just point out this general truth of political science: that in the long run the only two choices are left-wing or right-wing authoritarianism. And that one of those two is much better for the good, honest people.

        Police have maintained anarcho-tyranny for decades so we shouldn’t shed any tears for their coming disappearance.https://twitter.com/bluesmobiledrv/status/1269650273779068929But at the same time, any of us in suburban, rural and small town areas need to be prepared for incoming self-hating white refugees. When the South African style home invasions ramp up in major cities, there will be goodwhite refugees flooding your quiet areas and bringing all their race traitor corruption with them. Do not let them in. Do not forgive. Do not forget.Start finding out now which properties are for sale or rent in your area, and start developing a screening process to ensure they don’t end up in the hands of race traitors. Otherwise your quiet hamlet may soon be swamped by people fleeing their own bad decisions, only for these people to enthusiastically turn your hamlet into Lewiston, Maine.Do not forgive. Do not forget. If self-hating whites don’t want cops, that’s fine, all the better for us. But they need to live with their decision. If they think they’re so right, they can hire private security or beef up their Shomrim forces. They do not get to flee to the countryside to escape the consequences of their indulgence of blacks.

            Yeah I live in an “urban-suburb” that’s still mostly white, and although I’d like to think that most whites have a clue, especially after neighboring urban-suburbs have “fallen”, it can be dispiriting.  I recall a woman getting carjacked and when she was interviewed by the TV station she was flummoxed as to what level of poverty and desperation drove the yoots to do such a thing…

        The difference between the old guard and the new guard is that the old guard never fully believed the “all groups are perfectly equal” mantra. The old guard believed that there was racism against blacks, but they also understood that blacks weren’t as capable as whites, which is why they never went full retard.The new guard truly believes that all groups are equally capable (and why not, it’s what they’ve been told their entire lives) and that any differences are 100% due to white racism. The new guard looks at the old guard and says, “Why didn’t you ratchet up the solutions to inequality over the past 50 years since the various gaps weren’t closing.”The new guard will continue to push ever more intrusion solutions to inequality. And since racial gaps are genetic and can’t solved, those solutions are going to get very intrusion indeed.

            In teaching, my colleagues truly believe that all are capable of doing equatable schoolwork.  If we just understand the trauma that has been inflicted upon them, they can be educationally saved.  If nothing else, the quarantine showed the dullness of that population.  Trying to get the POC’s to do anything was impossible, if I just would have made one more phone call I guess…….

            Will any level of intrusion gets blacks to an equal level with whites? I would say no, but then there could be extreme wealth transfers, like maybe giving up your house or your retirement funds to blacks. Those are the kinds of things it would take to satisfy their demands. Or maybe it’s not enough…

                You’re too good hearted. The answer isn’t no, it’s that the stars will burn out first.Since the Great Society programs were implemented we’ve spent something in the neighborhood of $20 trillion dollars on trying to bring Blacks up to even a basic Eurasian level. Welfare, grants, subsidies, housing, food, access to modern medicine, technology a free ride though our best educational institutions and on and on. We provide them with jobs at every level of government to give them access to a middle class life, we now do the same in private industry. They don’t have to compete for these jobs nor do they have to attain even a minimal level of competence. All we ask is that they just show up and not be disruptive. Take the money and live a comfortable life. We give them functioning schools and they destroy every single one of them. We give them decent homes in working class and middle class neighborhoods and they can’t be bothered to replace a board or add a new coat of pain. Our cities are police states because that’s what is required to control large Black populations.Those homes your grandparents built are now zoos. Every single institution and every aspect of our culture has been ghettoized. If you mix a highly evolved culture and a primitive culture the highly evolved one isn’t averaging up.The Black riots of the ’60s + $20 trillion = The black riots of 2020. Nothing has changed. The largest and most expensive social experiment in world history has been a catastrophe for all involved.Our natural striving to seek and create has been damned up and misused. Against the wishes of most of our tribe. All for nought. The costs to our social milieu are incalculable for we are no longer even able to dream what we might have dreamed and accomplished.This is the true tragedy of our age.

                    “The largest and most expensive social experiment in world history has been a catastrophe for all involved.”An experiment is exactly what it has been. The communists are like an entire tribe of Mengele’s experimenting upon the children of the West. That the complete failure of their experiment is resulting in dead and unborn white children is simply the tails side of the “heads I win, tails you lose” coin toss. They are monsters.

                            Although the fictional version of Mengele certainly describes those self same communists- projection at work again.



(True, the real Mengele was a kindly combat nurse.

Horace, the Mengele story was a fundraising stunt by a group called CANDLS- “survivors” who had no surgical scars.)

                Protests are simply passive-aggressive shaming and scolding.  That said, the Vietnam war protests had a concrete and achievable goal, to end the war.  The current protests have no concrete goal, only an existential one, that cannot be achieved until people get their heads on straight.  But the powers-that-be will continually stir the pot so that can never happen.  By the way, pummeling people you disagree with by scolding and shaming them is not exactly a recipe for success.The “goals” of this thing are unattainable, by design.  It is simply a framework to perpetuate a forever shitshow, so that certain elements can take advantage of aspects of it.I have taken to saying, “Yes, there is institutional racism. It is created by the dominant race in the culture living under the creed of the race.  Name one dominant race that has given up its dominance, where things don’t go down in flames.  Name one culture where racial or religious dominance is shared, and things go well.  It doesn’t exist, you cannot name one instance, ever, in human history.  The real world says you live under the creed and values of the dominant race or religion, and that’s the way it is.  If you don’t like what you live under, then shut up or move to a different place.  Those are the only choices you get.  Unless you want to burn down the status quo and establish something else in place of it, which is a process filled with ruin and suffering.  Those are your only choices.  The rest of it is fantasy, about as realistic and imaginary as a certain John Lennon song”.

                    No one wants to eliminate racism, they just want to change positions of power with the “decried” racists so as to practice their own racism—upon Whites and others to be named at a later date.  One only need look at South Africa to see how this will play out over the power transition period and beyond.

                Even that won’t work. Blacks will piss away any amount of money that you give them. Also, no amount of money will stop them from killing each other – and whites. They don’t kill each other now because that are hungry or need money for a place to live. They kill each other over stupid fights.There’s no amount of money that can make black people into white people.

                    White people are White people because there was a survival premium for certain characteristics: intelligence primarily but openness-inquisitiveness low time value and trust.These have long been absent in black populations and in the 20C were reversed for blacks.

                Theoretically, if the laws and responsibilities were enforced on blacks, those most genetically disposed to social pathologies would eventually removed from the population over hundreds of generations. Of course, everyone else would have to put up with centuries of shit. So I guess it will remain only a theoretical possibility.

                    You’re being too optimistic when you estimate centuries.  Try thousands of years of environmental and genetic pressure plus White admixture, and you still would get less than an average White society.

                        It might be much faster than that.  Murders in England declined fairly quickly with capital punishment.  That was a matter of a few centuries.

                            Agree: Russian and Ukrainian wowen are famously attractive but no one talks about why: The men the ugly women would have married (I know it’s bizarre but there used to be a correlation between marriage and childbearing) were slaughtered in the Wars for Democracy . The few surviving men chose the best looking women- no surprise there, Look what can be done in just 100 years.

                It has been stated that if you took all the resources of the US and divided them equally among the populous, within a decade or so, the same individuals would have the most and the same individuals would have the least.  In short, we’d be the same society of unequal distribution of wealth.Better believe it.

                            I’m gonna agree with Ben here.  We do know of Native Americans working out schedules of eclipses and the tracks of the planets and of course they did have writing and some mathematics, at least among some groups.  My guess is that NA were somewhere intermediate between whites and blacks in average intelligence.  The maths and writing systems were probably due to their geniuses but this is always the case.  My guess is that Africans simply had such a low average IQ and such low population density that getting even a handful of them that were smart enough to put together a system of writing or math was impossible.

                                The pre-political correctness anthropology/genetics argument is simply that the Negroid race never developed beyond a certain point because there was no “selection pressure.” In other words, they were good enough to survive in their environment, and the brain did not have to develop to the higher levels that Caucasiod and Asiatic races had to, to deal with harsher environments. The old world primates, if there are any left, are very close relatives to Man, but none have near the brain capacity of even the Groid 🙂 A brain is “expensive” in evolutionary terms, and even these non-human primates are optimally adapted to their niche — otherwise they would have died off millions of years ago.The Americas indigenous people are supposed to have come via Siberia, so I guess they would be related to Asiatic.I’m no expert in anthropology and the Spaniards dd a lot of damage, as conquerors often do, but the Inca, the Maya had some great “Western” style achievements, as Pozymandias notes above. A few of these are impressive enough that exactly how they were built defies reasonable explanations to date (Machu Pichu, I think).

        In an extremely wealthy neighborhood near me black lives matters signs have popped up in a couple yards. They’re exactly the same. Homemade, black spray paint on some old sheet stretched between two tall wood stakes hammered in the ground. They both look like crap but the point is is there exactly the same. Different houses different streets but somehow there was a common thought process. I do feel there is a spirit descending over us right now. A terrifying spirit

            There is BLM signage on churches, stores, and people’s yards in the various white areas around where I live. Also white people carrying signs that contain slogans of the their new masters.I assume this public homage is intended as a shield meant to keep them safe. It probably will help to keep them being the last ones eaten.

                BLM signs appeared in our neighborhood. I tore them down as they were posted on community property without HOA permission and did not meet CC&amp;R requirements.The shopping center just down the street had credible information that the rioters were planning to take it to our suburb so they have deployed barricades and reduced hours. The last thing we need is the rioters thinking they had any sympathy for them.My wife posted on nextdoor that these people don’t speak for the neighborhood and if they want to put up signs to do it on their own property.

                        If on private land, you cannot lawfully tear them down without permission of the property owner or an authorized representative. If HOA you need to operate through the HOA, no independent justice.If on public land, you cannot lawfully tear them down if the signage poster has obtained a permit to affix the signs there.However, if on public land the posters were not authorized by government then they are effectively trash and you can lawfully remove them exercising your First Amendment rights as a counterstatement. Just claim “green” practices by not merely tearing up the signs but collecting them in a trash bag and perhaps composting them. Do not impose your own signs by replacement tactic, a judge is not going to view that favorably. It’s their signage or no signage.

            It’s the white equivalent of “Black-Owned Business” signs that popped up during the rioting, looting and arson. Like those, it won’t work for them. Expect big houses to be outlawed and seized as the first phase of socialist distribution in these cop-free zones.

            You people need to get out of the cities and suburbs.  Some idiots try to organize a BLM rally in my rural Oklahoma county this past Saturday.   About 30 people showed up.  Half of them were fat white women with their half negro chillens in tow.  Maybe 5 negro men in all.There were more rednecks driving trucks with Confederate flags than “protesters.”  There are still white men with balls in this country.   Just not many in the cities or suburbs.

                    Compsci, no one gives a shit about rural Oklahoma (including people in the metro areas of OKC and Tulsa).  That’s why I like it.  We are off the radar of the nut jobs in power.We can still live as proud white people because we don’t matter.  I don’t want to matter.  I just want to be left alone.The only thing most people know about rural Oklahoma is from The Tiger King.  I watched one episode. Other than the faggottry, it’s pretty typical of the rural part of this state.I know it’s not for everyone on our side.  I just want our people to know such places exist.  West Virginia and eastern Kentucky seem like similar areas for dissident whites in the eastern US who want to escape the madness.

                        Ha! On a back road, there’s a typical, tiny Oklahoma town, right above the Texas border

Just down from the quirky homemade windmill farm (barrels as wind blades, that sort of thing)- there is a home, a building like a smaller Parthenon.

Greek columns, majestic stone facing, and on the top, giant chiseled letters: GOD’S HOUSE

There it is. Now you know where He lives, west of Ardmore or Dumont I think.

                In our little mid state town, there was a rumor last week a bunch of blm &amp; pantifa protestors were going to bussed in from the metro area a hundred miles away.  As a result, a good number of armed citizens gathered at the supposed staging area.  Turned out it was an unfounded rumor, but nice to see folks push back against this crap.

            Not seeing that in my middle-middle-class white neighborhood, but I am seeing lots of American flags. Yes, believing in America anymore is quite silly, but at least it’s a show of resistance, paltry though it may be, to the Hutu supremacists.

        Yep, we’ve got a collection of “ way past their sell date” white geezers, soy boy whites, idiot blacks and hysterical wammens running the show and this is what we’ve devolved to.  I’m not saying everything was hunky dory back when the dreaded patriarchy ran the show, but at least there was a “can do” attitude and we we’re moving confidently forward into the future.  Now, it’s just a bunch of hysterical loons running around in a panic, kowtowing and turning everything over to the lowest intelligence and most criminally inclined segment of our population.  What could possibly go wrong?

        One solution to the “sea of lies” problem is to wean people off the mainstream media, to just relentlessly attack and shit on NYT, CNN, BBC, et al.

The problem is, it’s hard to redpill the masses about the mainstream media…without control of the mainstream media.

But we’ve just got to keep at it like coked-up beavers. Not much else we can do right now.

            The problem is that we must get to the children. The reason the media even works is because we have a population of people who are incapable of thinking, especially on this subject. They have been conditioned since the time they were small children to believe in equality and anti-racism. It is embedded in their identities.

                The normals are incapable of critical thought . They function on the level of emotion as it relates to their conditioning, with key stimuli triggering fixed action responses. The state controlled indoctrination centres and controlled media have set up emotional landmines that are activated with trigger words rendering them incapable of autonomous action.Thought leaders , those that finance them, their agents and those interested in their ideas have made their decisions and know where they stand.Our target has to be the normal that resisted his conditioning and the mid-wit, that is still capable of independent thought, with a capacity to formulate a picture of the world that corresponds with reality.We do not have to overthink our dispossession or reformulate what is a simple message . The non-Whites want your stuff . They will not be swerved !The people who are against you and their hirelings have names and addresses . They need to be called to account . We need to hold them to their own standard of collective guilt and punishment , unto the third and forth generation.We do not need any new ideologies . You don’t have to reinvent the wheel . The only way to secure “ Freedom of Association “ is total hegemony . The winner takes it all . The loser takes the fall .

                                Lineman, I will answer you earnestly . I don’t have the solution.My people were targeted as kulaks i.e. tight fisted – they were farmers, shepherds and Cossacks. They wanted freedom of association . They reaped the whirlwind. My father was made an orphan during the Civil War and my mother’s family starved in the famine of 1932/33.We were on the losing side in the last War. The Germans rescued them. The Germans wanted “Freedom of Association”. They were unable to vindicate that most basic right though they fought bravely, to the very end.My parents worked the land feeding the war effort and, as with the Soviets, they were not paid for their labour until they were awarded a small German pension in the 80’s. When you are not paid for your labour you are a slave. They never had an unkind word to say about the Germans who liberated them, nor did anyone else in our community.The Southern Cavaliers wanted “ Freedom of Association “. They acquitted themselves bravely and are an example for all eternity. For a time they rechristened self-determination as Jim Crow – in the end the kritarchy ruled against them at every opportunity.The Boer of South Africa wanted “Freedom of Association“- their women and children were rounded up and starved in concentration camps.The South Africans rebranded “ Freedom of Association “ as “ Apartheid “ and the Rhodesians called it “ Independence “ . Regrettably, chivalry and reasonableness failed them .When the Melians declined the ham sandwich in favour of a Spartan Turkey dinner , the Athenians answered:‘Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a necessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can. And it is not as if we were the first to make this law, or to act upon it when made: we found it existing before us, and shall leave it to exist forever after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that you and everybody else, having the same power as we have, would do the same as we do.’John De Warenne, Earl of Surrey (1231-1304) when challenged in 1278 by royal commissioners to produce title to his land, produced an old rusty sword declaring, “Here, my Lord, is my warrant ” (warrantus: a pun which no doubt appealed to the somewhat intractable sense of honour of the time). My ancestors came with William the Bastard and won their lands with the sword, and by the sword I will hold them against all comers.” Earl John won his case.What is is , it’s always been that way and there is no sign that this is ever going to change . If you have a right , then who do you petition to uphold it ? Who enforces that right ? If you have a right, which is a limited entitlement in a legal structure, to whom do you appeal that right to ?Tort resolves differences between people with differences. It resolves those differences by judging the cost. Emotions are not a cost, they are what you have to bear! However, tort is secured by violence. The violence of men.I’m not the Big Brain and I don’t have all the answers. However , I remember that everyone and their uncle thought that the Soviet hegemony would last forever; then one day the Berlin wall fell and Santa had Nicolai and Elena Ceaușescu shot on Christmas Day – soon after the Union itself was dissolved .On Festivus there is the airing of grievances . My hope is to live through the Interregnum, Lustration and the settling of accounts.The White man is always outnumbered.Lineman – I like Glen Campbell as well , however I prefer “ The Highwayman “ – what one man alone singing with a guitar can do is inspirational .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKmr7zFcSSQ“ Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage – and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope! “Hail Victory !

                The young seem the most vulnerable to propaganda; they were the most afraid of the Covid hysteria and are posting BLM on their social media profiles. Many of my children’s friends who grew up in fundamentalist and evangelical churches are engaging in this nonsense.Home school if you are able. Pay others to do it if you can’t yourself. Teach your kids and grandchildren the Bible. Be careful of youth groups, though. Most are lead by woke young pastors who believe racism is our greatest sin. Last night my daughter went to her youth group. Of course the subject was racism. A young man asked why he was working three jobs to pay for his college while the black kid next door had free college. He was quickly shut down.

                    The entire organizational structure of the US is suffused with anti-white racism. The only way to avoid it is to withdraw as much as humanly possible and to consort with those who are not AWRs.

                    The national denominations are all converged on this point. They buy the Jesus was an immigrant-anti-racist.  They are selling progressive sjw-ism in a Christian wrapper.The second you allow your children into this unholy mess, they will brainwash them.  The proto-SJWs and SJWs have been in control of everything having to do with children from the time I was a kid in the 70s and probably before then too.This is why the religious have always had lots of programs involving kids. They wrap up the religion in such a way that it becomes part of their identity, of who they are.

        White refugee relocation camps also known as suburbs are the new inner party’s best friend. They will joyously feed the crocodile as often as need be so they can…put in another productive day at the office, do the grocery shopping, take their kids to their lessons, keep their streaming service, have their brakes replaced, drive up to the mountains for the weekend and all the other SWPL.The collapse will fray the edges of their communities slowly working its way throughout the whole. Those who can’t hold on will be seen as not being the right kind of person. Their insularity will become more and more cultish. Some will need to be roasting on a cannibal’s spit before they finally get it, many will never get it. Seventy-five percent of YTs will never ever roar against the dying of the light.The twenty-five percent not willing to go gently (maybe even that’s too optimistic) have their work cut out for them.

            Yves – I do think that 25% is far too optimistic.  But for that tiny remnant of us who will not submit, ever,  I would offer the words of William Henley:INVICTUSOut of the night that covers me,Black as the pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds and shall find me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate,I am the captain of my soul.

            I think most of our Elite are pedophile Satanists. And even if some of them aren’t, they are adjacent  and complicit. And tie this in with the generational promotion of atheism,  which clearly they don’t believe, they believe in Supernatural forces  but the only real resistance towards them is God so if they separate you from God they’ve separated you from your only hope

                Even if they don’t believe it, they behave as if they do. There was a ceremony in Europe a few years ago to open a tunnel that went through a mountain. It is one of the creepiest things I have ever seen. Then there’s the building designed to look like the tower of Babel.Here’s a link to just a few snippets of the tunnel opening cerimony:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_4yjAD9MJwHere’s the whole thing:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4NU0Tok1T4It is REALLY creepy.Then there’s the people running the EU. Just look at them. They are physically repulsive. I just saw a video of winnie the flu meeting some European leaders. Macron and Wicked Witch of the West was there with some EU guy and they are hideous, especially the EU guy. They are just repugnant looking. Totally look like pedos.

        Instead of America in the late 1960s, look to the USSR in the late 1980s. There’s an Inner Party revolution for you! Wish I hadn’t deleted my archives, I had a whole post on this, but the gist was: The whole Soviet promotion system then, like the SJW promotion system now, was based on fealty to ideology… whatever that happens to be. Which, naturally, selects for feckless weasels whose only talents are ass-kissing and shifting with the ideological winds. Were you wired in enough to figure out thatan article aboutlinguistics,for pete’s sake, was the signal for a major policy shift? Then you were destined to go far in the nomenklatura, comrade.The turning point was Khrushchev’s famous “secret speech,” the one in which he denounced “cults of personality.” Ol’ Nikita of course had no real problem with cults of personality — his own was pretty robust; it only seemed mild compared to Stalin’s — but denouncing them was a goodtacticalmove. That’s all it was, tactics, aimed as much at Mao Zedong as at the Russian Politburo. Khrushchev was the only figure with any pull to survive both the PurgesandThe Great Patriotic War for the Motherland — he knew what he was doing.But then Gorbachev happened, as my students would’ve written back in my teaching days. He was a youngster during WW2; he started his training for the nomenklatura right as Stalin died — that is, crucially, he started his rise when Soviet politics ceased to be full-contact. The losers in Nikita’s day got tortured to death, and their families sent to the gulag; in Mikhail’s day, the losers got sent to administrate a tractor factory in Siberia. Notquitethe same thing…Once the nomenklatura finally put one of their own at the top, it was over. Khrushchev was both a sincere Communist and a standard-issue Asian despot; when they conflicted, the latter won out. Gorbachev was a sincere Communist… and that was it. He reallybelieved, in a way that the earlier Chairmen simply couldn’t. He and his merry band of new-generation do-good-niks couldn’t wait to force the last of the old fossils from WW2 out of office… and, well, here we are. The analogy’s not perfect, but it’s a much better guide to what’s happening than yet another aging-Boomer ode (or condemnation, to taste) of thesoixante-retards.

            I think the whole “collapse” of the USSR was a recognition that the business model no longer worked and a cover for transferring the state assets to the (((oligarchs))). Isn’t it strange how the state assets ended up in the hands of unknown mid-level technocrats who belonged to a persecuted minority after receiving the advice of (((Harvard economists)))?

        This is the fourth day in a row I’ve been dominated by dread feelings. I have to admit the WuFlu Virus and the Floyd riots were the biggest one-two punch I’ve received in my long life. Even during the fall of 2016 I didn’t feel this dire to the dread i feel, which is an intuition based upon the realization that certain tenets I felt were present are now being blown away to the winds.Make no mistake: It’s only going to get worse. The Left has identified the weak points, and with kneeling cops, will only make it worse. If Trump loses, and we lose the Senate, the country is over. And the kneeling cops, along with the kneeling military, will not side with the normal American and his 2nd Amendment veto. By then, the Federal Cops created to enforce the New Constitution will overwhelm even our seasoned militarized rural dwellers, and humanity is doomed.Sucks, but what can you do?

                Correct.  Disinformation designed to demoralize.  If you believe in these people being stupid, you know they can not function without a White majority in control.  They will try and fail.  This in turn will open many eyes.I’m hoping that some cities like Minneapolis really do defund the police and fail spectacularly.

                I agree that us normals would trounce the Left easily in a fair fight. My own concern is that I can see how the Left will essentially hijack the election process without the ability to monitor the situation.But I’ve done my part. For what its worth, I’m documenting every instance of every LE and military that has kneeled or, ffs, how a police chief lied COMPLETELY FACE DOWN to the BLM gods. To be blunt, the last hope of defense was using the 2nd Amendment Veto in after the American Anschluss, but I was banking on the fact that most local LE and US Military would not support the oppression of federalized troops. The cops kneeling was what sent the chill to my spine that hasn’t left.

        My fellow Honkys, let’s be honest, this isn’t our fight. We have no power over this. If anything this summer is revealing one thing: Steve Sailer was right again.If the GOP is to win anything we must make the Democrats, the Black party. The ONLY group that defended the inner cities were hispanic street gangs. The whites holed up in their Stategic Hamlets watched it all posting insipid “Rooftop Korean” memes.But I am confident the outer party is still functioning. The GOP will happily follow the Democrats in their Negro idolatry. So nothing will change.We are well and truly fucked.

                That’s true, and Trump is leading the charge with his obsession with “low black unemployment,” etc. GOP needs to focus and amplify everything BLM is doing, including showing black behavior and crime stats, and really make blacks look bad.  Imagine the campaign videos the GOP could produce showing the worst in black behavior and tie that all in with the Dems.  Turn the propaganda around on them.  Of course I’m dreaming and it won’t happen because they’re pussies, but it would be glorious and Trump would win in a landslide.

            Sailer is about as relevant today as the constitution (i.e. not at all) – still smirking with wry amusement, certain that things will right themselves and then oh won’t they all feel silly.  That’s his take and he’s sticking to it.

            First ask yourself, do I want the US to come back? To what? To when? All the better periods that you may favor led to this one. It’s a one way street. The anti-Federalists were right. Nothing would hold back what was coming. Give credit to the plan for lasting 72 years. The left never respected it, and they count on the right dragging it behind them. And we do, reverently.

Now the replacements are BLM, that is BLM’s core demand.

                Worse, you will be unemployable with ‘cop’ on your resume. Moreover, hundreds or thousands of your colleagues will be competing with you regionally for new cop jobs, private security or any other position you can hope to get. In a recession or depression.Property crimes will be the great barometer for civil collapse. Once violence is unprosecuted, as it mostly is where I live, unless against a protected class, then society divides into gangs and factions with whitey as the prime target.In other news, I returned from the park outside my doorstep in Chicago. Aside from the park personnel removing the graffiti on our statues, it’s an absolutely gorgeous day and I caught the dandelion parachute release into the sunshine with several other locals and we burst into laughter everything was so perfect. All white, middle-aged, and apparently having fond memories of better days triggered by the dandelions.At least today looks to be an excellent one.Edited to add:Just prepared to cross a street. A military Humvee drove by. It was equipped with a CROWS II remotely-operated machine gun turret but without the ammo box loaded. WTF needs a .50 cal to suppress rioting? It’ll chew through buildings right quick.Hmmm….

            Imagine an army of Mohammed Noors- the half-trained quota cop who killed Justine Damond- riding around in technicals, dispensing “justice” whacked out on khat (or the domestic equivalent) and you begin to understand what the tranny freaks on the Minneapolis City Council have in mind.

                Who’s going to repair Mohammed’s car to make sure it functions well. Who’s gonna make sure the $300,000 police vehicle that he’ll roll around and has good Internet In the vehicle? Who’s going to make sure to take it to the dealer to make sure that the tires are working right? Unless you can figure that out it’s just gonna be a bunch of mad max gangsters Roaming around like idiots.

                    There are enough woke pozzed whites to still do the blue collar work in these cities. And once they run out of them, it will be a very binary solution because by that time they will have full control of everything.“Fix our trucks, or die.” Tough choice…

                At the micro level, certain people have very specific goals in mind.  In the black areas of Minneapolis, no-go zones and sharia law will be practiced by the locals (because it works so well in Paris).  When it quickly goes shithole, racism will be blamed, and more gibs will be demanded for those areas.  There is a method to the madness.  It simply adds to the whole separation thing, from where we sit.

                I’m going to be really disappointed if they don’t eliminate the Police Dept. in Minneapolis.  I was counting on that sequence of events (no police and a burning city) – as a “teachable moment” for some of the people I know who just can’t seem to wrap their heads around what is going on.

        “worship black people.”  You pressed the 5000 megaton button there.  Yes, the white guilt ridden are now ready to go all the way and announce their intent to live as white slaves.  It’s not possible to talk around this one, you will either submit or get ready for a long hard slog.  I’ll be one of the sloggers and I hope there will be enough of us to slog out to the other side.

                You beat me to it. When I see these white women supporting BLM, I just tell them that they are part of the problem and that the Race2Dinner organization can help. That’s the group that gets white women to host dinners for women of color who in turn, berate the white woman for being a racist. Shuts their pie hole pretty quick!

            Subliminal messaging through media (television, radio, ads, newspapers, magazines). It’s been a problem for decades. Watch almost any show and you will find examples of images or dialogue designed to steer your thoughts in particular directions. “Forgiveness, white girl with black man, etc.” I turned on the radio the other day and heard two words: better together. I turned it back off.

        All the talk about ending the police departments is for show. The police exist to protect them and to police us. They can write whole new mission statements full of SJW-isms all they want. They can even change the name from PD to crisis response unit or whatever other euphemisms they can come up with, but they will still do the same thing. In the end, the cities vowing policing cuts will be raising the PD’s budgets. The increased budgets will be needed to provide some gibs to “community leaders”  They will probably create some civilian oversight boards and staff them with easy to control blacks. This has happened before in many different places.

            Yes, but as I discussed with a retired cop friend last night, the police are not going away—ever.  But the issue is, what will replace them?  You can disband the current “White” force, and simply hire back the token coloreds—and then some.  That has the benefit of a quick change.  The bottom line is who replaces them and what do the new “rules of engagement” look like”I maintain that the current police force functionality will not be improved as the liberal airheads will put into effect their ideological beliefs wrt human behavior, diversity/inclusion, and social justice. Crime will increase, incompetence will rise, folks will flee and those who can not will suffer the effects of such ideology over reality.  Be careful what you wish for.We’ve already seen such on a minor scale where I live in the public schools.  Fed’s a year or so before Obama left got involved in school discipline matters.  All schools were mandated to stop disproportionately disciplining the vibrancy as compared to the Whites.  Discipline—bad already—collapse in the more vibrant schools.  Chaos.  We still have not recovered as the students have figured out they are disciplinarily, “untouchable”.Imagine an entire city in which this happens wrt crime.  NYC seems an budding example with their “no bail” and “no enforcement” policies. Turn style jumpers, fare skipping, aggressive pan handling, public urination, alcohol consumption, shop lifting, litter, homicide rising. The list goes on.

                I would actually attribute some level of the rise in violent crime in last few years to the “reform” of the “school to prison pipeline” and the total collapse of discipline in schools.I am not wishing for a total rollback of police, though in some ways, the police state really does need to be rolled back.  As it is, the police state is mostly only affecting good white folks paying fines. Of course, in the rural areas and the suburbs, the law is applied to the letter.If other cities are like my city, and I hear that they are, it is pretty difficult to get sent to prison from one of these big cities. Enforcement is very lax.  The cops may bust heads in the hood, but there are 16 million arrests a year in the US with only 2 million in prisons and jails.  These high numbers are because in the cities, people just are not being sent to prison until they do something really bad.  We have the opposite of broken windows policing.This is why I believe we are under anarcho-tyranny.

                    During the lockdown when I never even saw a patrol car on the streets in my suburban area of southern California, I think crime actually went down. And this was after CA released numerous prisoners. I think it was due to more people being at home deterring burglars and porch pirates. Now that things are opening up, I saw the thin blue line giving scores of tickets to those illegally parked near a re-opened park. “To protect our pensions and to serve our political masters”.

Literally just few days ago, Brees and his wife were probably middle of the road CivNats. But now they have been moved by the “holy” spirit. We just witnessed a religious conversion in real time. How these people could live in a place like New Orleans (I used to) for so long and not understand the nature of the problem is unbelievable. It shows just what a bubble they live in.

                    You can justify anything you want using the bible. Which is why it has been a potent tool of the Left. In general, religions are based on faith and don’t really attract critical thinkers. That’s why grifters like Osteen, Bakker, Roberts, Hagee etc. are so successful. You would be much better off using Aesop’s Fables to teach your kids moral lessons. It’s far more interesting, better written and kids will recognize that the the talking animals are not real.

                        You can justify anything you want using *anything*. Christianity is far more than ‘good moral lessons’, even if most never get past that idea.

        I dont think the left are afraid at all. They are fanning the flames and creating a global movement of this specifically because these riots are sending a thrill up their legs. This is the final boost needed for them to fully solidify their control. Its also a test run for future crises. Coronavirus will be back in the fall, global warming is always with us, and of course someone is going to go on a spree killing.My predictions for the next 5 years. Sometime before the 2024 election will come electronic voting. The point of democracy is to give dissenters a chance to hold the reigns of power. In modern times it was used by those in power to create dissenters to take the reigns from traditional America. No reigns passing will be needed anymore, so if it doesnt go electronic where it can be tightly controlled then I expect a massively enormous amnesty soon with resettlement in all of the right places. Otherwise I expect no voting tho I consider this unlikely since they will keep consistent with their prior professed values.The coronavirus and riots thing showed they are getting better at using a manufactured crisis to control their rent farms. As soon as there is a mass shooting between now and 2024 that kills at least a handful of people from a white guy, they will trot out the same playbook and use the opportunity to get that checked off the list, this goes double if it is after Trump is out. There will be riots, there will be further purges, the nra will be destroyed and we will see the first white person fired from his job for owning a gun or donating to the nra, and there will be no legal challenge. Owning a gun, if it continues to be allowed at all, will be something you hide from people and keep hush about because it will make you a dangerous and immoral person. Any white defending themselves from a non white will be destroyed no matter how clearly legal it was. Either gun ownership will stop or it will be made unbearable.Many of Trumps’ court nominations will be impeached or otherwise removed. Anyone who cant be known to play ball will be gone or at least put on notice. Cant risk the courts putting a stop to this even for a moment.There will be a crisis about Trump before the election. This time the GOP will go full drama tho. Whether it is a sexual assault accusation or a racism or whatever the GOP will completely turn their back on him and many will resign from admin before election. They wont stop him from running but they will make him look like he is completely isolated and impotent.Theres no practical reason to make these predictions but its Monday and i dont feel like working just this second.

        “That’s why they are plotting to dismantle the police. They want all of those white men out of their cities and this is the fastest way to do it.”I am very doubtful that any configuration of a ruling class will ever exist without some form of police. What will happen is that either whites will be purged from standard police departments, or some non-standard non-white enforcer organization will replace the police. In either case, most enforcement action will move to the suburbs, where extortion will be imposed on the productive classes. The real question is, will the latter put up with it? There are an awful lot of old boomers with deer rifles and nothing to lose.

            That’s correct.  There will always be police.  The elite will hire theirs as they do now.  Inner cities will construct something for public consumption.  But since it must be different—hence less effective—for current policing, it will fail and the inner cities become even more dangerous.  That leaves the burbs in a dilemma.  I assume we will have some combination of neighborhood watch and private hire.

                    Yes.  British invention.  But we are not the same Christian, White people as 200 years ago.  Self policing isn’t going to fly.  We can help—as temp deputies for emergencies—but it’s a full time occupation these days.

                        In the cities, perhaps. Mostly, the police exist to protect criminals from mob justice. County sherrifs and deputies seem to do a pretty good job in less populated areas.The need for police is directly related to the need for Goodwhites to pretend that the cult of multicult has no problems at all.

But what frustrates me is guys I know on our side of the divide who match every move of the black pawn with their own.They keep sending me twitt clips and whatnot of pocs being stunning and brave by standing up to the totalitarian BLM regime.What they always seem to miss is how these brave black voices always qualify their opinion with: (a) I am a poc and therefore have the authority to speak about “race”; (b) I have been a victim of raciss whites; (c) my opinion is informed by talented tenth black scholars. IOW, they are not on “our side”, they are not about the truth but just a different form of virtue-signaling. These anti-woke pocs never challenge the frame of white privilige or systemic racism or any othet part of originalsin of whiteness. Only the means employed by the extremists.Makes me realize once again just how far away even dissident white men can be from their right to exist as a people.

                    Compsci, they’re scared of the other competition.

They use pseudoscience developed as spell-language to defeat the white heroic-based males, an art developed in the distant past.

It’s a feminine art, undermining through gossip to avoid direct retaliation; the act of disapproval / approval has replaced the art of challenge.

British parliamentarians used to relish strong questions during Question Hour, but no more.

Here is a fascinating thread I discovered yesterday:

                The do that because of an ideology called ” Critical Theory ” that was devised and promoted by a group of scheming levantine confidence men, who taught them an easy to remember sales pitch that they repeat ad nauseam .There is no such thing as “Truth“ or an objective standard or being objectively better or worse, right or wrong, or more able or less able to make an argument because these are all structures and examples of different perspectives which are all unique and of equal value that therefore should be heard.Every racial group has a unique narrative and none of them are wrong. You can’t reason with a negro that they aren’t oppressed because they believe they are and that’s their story.Each sex or particular “aboriginal“ or ethnic or grievance group has a particular tale to tell so, it’s just a way to write about your ‘feelings‘.The only reason I think that Plato is a better philosopher than the boot lipped Kimberly Crenshaw , who by the way has appropriated a blonde bleach job for her nappy haired dreadlocks, is because I’m a White male and I can’t separate my judgment from my being a White male, so we can’t know who’s better because there is not objective standard, therefore you have to have equal representation from every minority on all philosophy faculties .Extend that representation beyond the Academy across the board, in a Global World where the golliwogs outnumber you 7 to 1 .

            “.. reposition [big box stores] in safer (read, white) areas,”Time for the white suburbs to write new zoning laws to keep the big boxes out, lest they attract people from the burned out areas who need to shop.perhaps maximum square footage limits would keep them out, and preserve the domain of Mom &amp; Pop stores.

                Yeah – that’s a great idea. Max square footage, max parking spaces, that sort of zoning thing can be effective. Part of the problem is that, just as the chinese have bought out politicians at the federal level, developers are good at buying local pols.There’s an interesting site called, “strong towns,” that gets in to this sort of good urbanism. It’s a fascinating read for lots of reasons, one of which it that it remains entirely naïve about how blacks work in cities. They imagine these cool towns where vibrancy is allowed and, in a hallucination, pretend that vibrancy won’t drive everyone out.Still, they get some things right.

        Yes to all of this, and most importantly, there will be Jackboots. No tyranny has ever succeeded without a corp of thugs to intimidate the sheeple and eliminate the dissident Alphas. And they will number in the 10,000s and have government sanction. And they will be well prepared to suppress militias and conventional opposition movements. And they will be utterly ruthless. And do not be fooled, these are not LEOs as we have known them. Jackboots are a covert army of invasion and a new paradigm will be needed to win against them.

            When you have jackboots of different races who hate each other it’s gonna be kind a hard to get organized. It’s one thing for Chinese jack boots to get organized or Nazi jackboots to get organized. They we’re all the same race. It’s not gonna work the same here. African-American people hate Latinos. They hate gay people. What about the Nation of Islam blacks and the Christian blacks. They hate each other. Do you think the Mexicans are going to be down with a bunch of black panthers coming in other neighborhoods to take their guns? The Brazil model for America is becoming more and more plausible

                You aren’t really this naive are you? These same ‘coalition of the fringes’ who would normally be at each other’s throats have done just fine for the past few years under a single mantra that will make them even more cohesive now that the gloves are off:Get WhiteyYou are delusional.

                        wtf does Subcon even mean? god damn I need a handbook for all your acronyms.I admit I am naive sometimes but when you said that all the other groups would band together in an even more cohesive manner, I nearly spit out my water. That is absolutely absurd.The reason they have done fine for the last few years is because whitey has been making sure that the electricity and water and roads and other infrastructure is functioning well. What happens when the white guy isn’t around to fix things?Also, Don’t me give the South Africa nonsense. The black population there is a huge majority. Here, the AA population is stagnant and will likely decrease as the abortions ramp up.EDIT:  SEE THE BELOW POST BY Thatperson……he articulates the point well

        “The normal person trying to figure out what is happening is left to swim in a sea of lies.” -ZmanIn the 1970s I saw that almost everything the press, government, “experts”, teachers, and others told me was false. Sometimes it was just false because the expert was wrong. We all are wrong at times. Sometimes what I was told was false because they lied. Sometimes they lied just for the hell of it, sometimes for profit, sometimes to protect their belief system, but most often for power.I learned to act like a detective on even the most simple of news items. It is amazing how often the “official story” just does not hold together. One can be right most of the time by refusing to believe whatever the official story is. I never believed the official 9/11 story for even a minute. But that does not  tell me what did happen, only what did not happen.We are swimming in a sea of lies, distortions, and propaganda. It is almost as if Lucifer where in charge of the narrative here on earth.

            “It is almost as if Lucifer where in charge of the narrative here on earth.”It’s a choice. Called free agency. I keep up with current events to be aware when the spanner is descending to whack. Agitating. Then I flip my attitude into gratitude for my miraculous life and those in it. Set daily news aside. This is a choice. I lighten up…my shoulders physically become lighter. I can see clearer, appreciate those in and what is in my life, and calmly move about my day. Fear the mind killer.Years ago I knew a Lakota guy who worked with “the medicine” who told me a story about every day evil. He wasn’t a drinker. He said he could stand in a bar, watch people drink, by drink 2 the minions were hovering around the person, by drink 3-4 the minions would attach themselves to the chest and back and the person would begin to shapeshift personality. Aggressive, argumentative, negative. Chemistry? What ever attributed to, over time this..whether by drink or what they think… eats one up physically and soulwise from the inside out. Rotten from the soul out and the head down. Call it WTF. Call it ridiculous. Call if whatever. Ignore it. Whatever. Just watch.I was dropped by the stork into a Secular Commie home. Taught to believe none of this. My parents laughed at Ronald Reagan when he proclaimed “The Evil Empire.” Laugh..he was dumber than a box of rocks! About 15 years ago, I could sense a switch had been flipped and evil was afoot. I thought…what does that look like and what does that mean? Here and there, a very young child takes great delight in setting the family cat alight. And repeats that act again.That is not epilepsy….a counselor can’t fix this….that is ****. Sudden evil..or..gradual embrace and descent…descent into evil by choice. The choices we make can inspire or degrade until the way back is forgotten. Evil does not look like evil. That’s why people fall for it and that’s why it works.

                What the line from the movie, “The Usual Suspects”…The devil’s greatest trick was making people think he doesn’t exist.  Yep.  Evil is evil, no other term for it (when you begin to see it) suffices.

                    Hi CompiSci.  The Range Daughter opined one of the main reasons for endless nihilistic riots and looting is a few generations raised on cell phones. People do virtual human contact and have little real human contact to work out the fine tuning of human interaction. So rioting and groveling are extreme human emotions, very stimulating and feel like a purpose as opposed to tappity tap tap tap, as the gradient of real every day human emotion is rarely plumbed. 1 to 10 on the Richter scale.

                    CompSciPlease forgive my being pedantic.It was Charles Baudelaire, the father of modernism. He wrote that in a short story called “ The Generous Gambler “ which was published in a short book called “ Paris Spleen “ in 1869.“My dear brothers, never forget, when you hear the progress of enlightenment vaunted, that the devil’s best trick is to persuade you that he doesn’t exist!”https://genius.com/Charles-baudelaire-the-generous-gambler-annotatedhttps://paroles2chansons.lemonde.fr/auteur-charles-baudelaire/poeme-le-joueur-genereux.htmlCheers

            I’m sure we all got emails these past few days from CEO types who could hardly put pen to paper such was the state of their grief over the events of the past two weeks.  My favorite was getting one from Petsmart; the irony was rich in that one.  My own global mega-corp sent out a letter of contrition and penance to all employees.  I can only imagine the forthcoming “training” that we’ll have to pencil whip in the coming weeks.

            A “feel” of coordination?  This thing is choreographed, right down to the smallest detail.The one thing they didn’t count on, was how easily people see through it all (even some of their supporters know it is, at root, a total con-job).  Not that it will do us much good, most likely.  That people are on to it means that they have to turn up the speed and the volume, quickly, and they are doing just that.

                Well, that’s why I’ve got my crew. We’re all moving 45 minutes out to a rural area, each one of us no farther than 10 minutes away from the other.They’re older guys than me, so there’s the added bonus of having more time to learn before it’s me at the reigns 24/7. I’d gladly take charge, of course; I just think there’s a little bit of apprenticeship left for me.I’m scared to shit, but dammit, I’m ready to ride. And boy, is it thrilling just to be alive.

        The military’s involvement in the insurrection tells the tale. While chemical and biological weapons in the hands of civilians opposed to the Inner Party sort of will level the playing field, the pieces are being put into position for a coup, show trials and genocide. Conservatism, Inc., will be down with anything the military does and will criticize the civilians who unleash weapons of mass destruction. We will be lucky to get a partition without massive losses of lives now. Dissolution will happen over time even though the new nations that arise from the ashes will not be internationally recognized, at least for a while.“Mitt Romney may not be down with Team Brown”He in fact is. Go back and check his laudatory remarks about Antifa.

                If there is a silver lining to Mittens’ presence in the Senate, it is that it demonstrates that Whites are still capable of acting in accordance with ethnic interests.He was elected because his family is LDS royalty.  This is a negative manifestation of a positive instinct.

                The LDS church is in grovel mode. Their monthly mag and bookstore catalogue is peppered with white grandmothers holding black grandkids…blackity-black-black-black. Laughable because Mormons mouth this pious platitude but don’t live this way. Read Bruce Charlton’s take on the fall of the non-essential churches.President Ballard’s (head of the Mormon 12) daughter lives directly across the street from me. No ghetto vibrancy around her nor Romney. For Thee, Not For Me! And yes Romney hates us with an ego-deranged white hot passion. Talked with an old Mormon gal who nattered  she doesn’t understand why he undermines Trump but she can’t vote for him anymore.  Well I’ll be! On the other hand, The Range doesn’t give a crap anymore. Just getting Ready!Friends returned to church yesterday…..a weak non-essential church that demanded 6 feet between each family, everyone masked and short services. Meh!PS: We shall get together with our neighbors, the husband an ex-CHP, to discus…ahmmm…community protection. Happy to have one in my neighborhood.We traveled to north of Mr. Lassen in way northern People’s Republic of the West to meet with Basic Husband’s family to scatter the ashes of the old matriarch who died at the beginning of the WuFlu gaslighting. On the drive up, Basic Husband worked with me to get my brain set to not walk into multiple fever swamps and booby traps by talking my way into them. Damn, I done goot! We got the hell out of Dodge mid afternoon, breathed a sigh of relief, and then back to the Reno overnight. Saw people with signs lining 4 street corners a mile away from motel, but with a laugh noticed they were Boomer homeless with panhandling signs. Have since returned to the land of deer and antelope playing regardless of 5th column takeover.

        “The revolution within the inner party will surely break containment and contaminate the entire society now.” Perhaps. The next 5 months should tell the tale. Many forces are in play, and the outcome is by no means certain. For one thing, the opposition hasn’t even taken to the field. For another, who cares if the rat-infested cities burn? Sustenance—especially food—doesn’t come from cities.

        There’s also a generational aspect to this that goes beyond the 1960’s and 70’s radical boomers.  The boomers were always kept in check by the financiers 10-20 years older than them.  Warren Buffett is an example of these guys, who were very, very smart and made their money when the BIG money was to be made just after the war, when the country was a virtual gold mine and cornucopia of opportunity. All that money they made compounded through the 70’s and 80’s, and they could write huge checks to various DNC subsidiaries to drive the inner party toward a moderate, very internationalist, and corporate driven agenda, not just to protect their assets, but because even as 10 year olds during the war they understood the tragic aftermath of conflict.  These people are now nearly all gone, with the radical boomer trust fund babies finally being able to finance their vision, unencumbered, to reach that elusive earthly Valhalla.  One powered completely by solar panels and wind turbines I may add.

            It’s called a “Moral panic.” The religon of woke is looking for witches to burn. It doesn’t matter if it’s for Jesue or social justice, “holy rolling” is what we do. America has always been a place where the livestock gets easily spooked and starts rampaging around, looking for scapegoats. It’s in our civic blood. It’s called catharsis. A ritual purification of fear and guilt. Many a philosopher has noticed that, for we humans, few things are more satisfying than watching our neighbor die in our place.

        So what is the end game when every leader is Black. When every single person on TV is Black. When all the Military and Police type forces are Black? When Whites have no representation or power at all?I figure that is the end game — widespread enslavement of Whites as a cheaper, faster version of China’s High IQ slave labor factories. Its why Corporate America is all on board with this.And its Civil War guaranteed — if you believe Machiavelli about people not forgiving be made poor. To make all this pay every White person has to be put in a camp and their property seized.

            The logistics of this scenario don’t work.  There just aren’t enough blacks to pull it off, at least not enough who are minimally competent enough to fill all the spots.  My guess is that this is what all the pozzing of whites is about.  There are plenty of dysfunctional and substandard whites who could replace all the important posts currently filled by competent and locally accountable people like sheriffs and county cops.  That’s what I think the push to disband the cops is really about.  There will be a call for essentially direct federal control of all “means of violence”.  That will indeed result in outright civil war.  I don’t think such a transition would be peaceful.  If you hear any media chatter about any disagreements between local and fed LEOs becoming “tense” or especially going to actual shooting I would begin paying a LOT of attention.

            With the highest rate of population growth, Africa is expected to account for more than half of the world’s population growth between 2015 and 2050. During this period, the populations of 28 African countries are projected to more than double, and by 2100, ten African countries are projected to have increased by at least a factor of five: Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Somalia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.White people are responsible for all of it, because we decided to give modern medicine and technologies to non-Whites, then feed them through aid programs so they could breed completely out of control.The most evil person ever to live was Norman Borlaug, the so-called Father of the Green Revolution, who is credited with saving one billion Africans from dying of starvation.In 1971, the population of Nigeria was 51 million. Thanks to Borlaug, it is estimated that the population of Nigeria will be 400 million.By 2050 there will be 2 billion jungle negroes in Africa with room temperature IQ’s .There are going to be four billion Africans in 80 years.So what we have with this ” White man’s Burden ” is feeding , clothing and housing infinity tar coloured nightmare creatures , each on top of the other, copulating and creating more negroes.Plantet of the Apes !THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE THE NEGROES WILL BE A TIME MACHINE OR A STAR GATE !

        How sad and pathetic Europe has become now that it mimics all US fashions, trends and memes. It used to be that American elite envied Europe and aped the old world, but now it’s exactly the opposite.Europe even chose to ape America by totally unnecessarily importing a race problem. Europe never had the problem of obsolete farm equipment littering its cities, yet they imported Africans and now native Irish boys are being murdered. Unforgivable.

            Europe didn’t import a race problem out of love for swarthy hordes but out of love for cheap labor and the fact that the same (((globalists))) who make policy here in the US also own the parliaments of Europe.  There’s also the divide and conquer methodology outlined inCulture of Critiqueand elsewhere.  That is, keep different factions and races of the masses riled up at each other so everyone fails to notice the puppetmasters.Europe also mimics everything bad that America comes up with because it has no remaining reserves of moral or religious purpose and has had an official religion of nihilism far longer than we have.  European society seems to have wanted to die for a long time but lacks the guts to pull the trigger itself and so adopts policies guaranteed to destroy it in the long run.  It’s a sort of “suicide by cop” on a continental scale.

                No need to break it down in Chicago. Nearly all black on black. See Second City Cop and Hey Jackass!:http://secondcitycop.blogspot.com/https://heyjackass.com/This said, our city is still beautiful and livable. I routinely walk to Lyric Opera from my office and there are another 50+ live theatres. I live next door practically to Second City Comedy and Zanies and down the street from the Steppenwolf. The food is ridiculously good and affordable here. My neighbors are smart as fuck, e.g., lead structural engineer, construction of Sears Tower, and I’m active with my neighborhood association (Old Town Triangle).Shit-congo is a misnomer, the LatinX and us Whites get along fine, we just need to remove the small hats and negroes.

        The conclusion I have come to is not a very original one, but at this point I am convinced it is true. There is only power, that is it. Everything else stems from power Morality, tradition, and anything else associated with civilization.None of that stuff is possible without power to support and enforce it. The Left has spent 100 years acquiring power in this country.I am not sure what my role can be to help our side. But at this point I am ready to fall in line behind the 1st viable “Strongman” that appears.what good are civil liberties and “freedom” when enemies of civilization (that’s what they are) can gut a police station right in front of you and your mayor bows down to them and asks for their blessing.I never thought I would get to this point, but that is where I am. What is happening is not acceptable.

            “But at this point…”I am of a similar mind. The traditional way is the new ruling class is comprised of whoever leads those who destroy the old ruling class. I saw some comment from George F. Will, the Cuckservative talking head, saying something of the order of “GOP voters will forget Trump very fast when he loses the election.” I used to assume that they were always being disingenuous when they said things this stupid (his implication being that we will all dutifully go back to voting for globalist Mitt Romney clones when Trump is done), but I don’t think that is the case for at least some of them. Cockroaches like Will didn’t build the corrupt globalist system, they inherited their roles in it from as evil but more capable men. Entropy manifests at all levels of structure.

        This is like China’s Cultural Revolution of the 1970’s, unleashed by Mao due to dissension among the communist ruling elites. Our Red Guards are ANTIFA and the BLM, but Americans are armed to the teeth (and increasing private armaments by the day). If the balloon truly goes up, ANTIFA and the BLM could be annihilated. Otherwise, they may end up ruling ugly degraded cities which would be no-go zones for everyone else.

            From the comments:“I was locked in my classroom with my students and I had a button under my desk that would bring in an armed policeman should things get out of hand.The windows were all opaque to keep people outside of the school from shooting at the students. Parents and students were not allowed to attend sporting events because of the gang violence.”Probably the first thing I noticed was that my seniors were functionally illiterate. They could neither read their textbook nor understand most of what came out of my mouth.……..Of course, I didn’t listen and I started to teach some basic literacy skills in my classroom. This angered my superiors so much that they transferred me to an even worse school which was something I didn’t think could exist. This place didn’t even have opaque windows but looked like a concrete bunker. Active shooter drills, scares and events occupied most of my time.I didn’t stay at that school long opting, instead, to teach in prison. At least the students wanted to come to class. I did this until the State cancelled the program and replaced it with pharmaceuticals to keep their prison population “quiet”.Those kids today are now pushing 40 years old.”

        What about the fact the violence has been almost entirely restricted to “Blue State” America? I’m not aware of a single place that voted for Trump that has had riots. The urban/suburban areas that have been hit all voted for Clinton. (If someone knows differently, let me know — and I’m referring to actual violence though, not some lame a-holes taking a knee).It seems to me this has had all the markings of a golem getting loose and attacking its creators.

            You are correct. There have been some threats to “take it to the suburbs”. My city about an hour south of LA is only 2% negro but there have been threats that have been credible enough for the shopping center down the street and just off of I-5 to reduce hours and have barricades on standby.

        The most fascinating aspect of the entire protest movement has been the lack of full spectrum warfare practiced by the left. The power system has not been destroyed, there have been zero cyber attacks, while food and water still pour into the cities.It’s indicative of the fact that we are dealing with room temperature morons at the moment who do not actually want to overturn society. They just think they can change the rules to favor blacks and everything will be the woke nirvana they were told they would see.The upswing is that once these “reforms” prove not to work – Quantavius still can’t do math, Laquisha still is not marriage material, no blacks win Nobel science prizes or land on the moon – the radical wokies will start implementing full scale warfare and things will get ugly.Be prepared.

The 1,000,000 protesters who were supposed to overrun DC last weekend?  It would be charitable to say they got 10,000.  Did you enjoy the DC mayor painting “DEFUND THE POLICE” in 20’ yellow letters?  Today the Biden/DNC rejected this idea outright.The George Floyd riots have been an unmitigated disaster for both the anti-Trump Uniparty and the batshit crazy Antifa types.  It won’t be a permanent setback, but it is very bad for them right now.  Biden just kicked their central slogan to the curb, most likely because he saw the latest round of polling.I think the last 2 weeks have been illuminating for Normal People.  The COVID19 lockdown hoax has been unmasked.  They’ve also seen what a USA without aggressive policing looks like.  And all of this has happened – nearly perfectly uniformly – in Democrat-run cities.Over on my side of the fence, we saw Esper decloak, revealing who he is, along with several current and past high-ranking military leaders.  Trump didn’t get baited into doing something dumb.  And millions of Americans learned that “defund/disband the police” is not metaphor.  It is an actual goal.I’m no fan of our hyper-militarized police, and we’ve seen what the corrupt FBI and DOJ are capable of.  But, after the last 2 weeks, nobody gets to pretend that the police have nothing to do with their towns not being incinerated by criminals.

        I’m in favor of partition now, by the way.  Here’s 15% of the US, on the coast, with oil and ports.God speed!What I am deadset against is we go hat in hand to beg for this, begging leave us alone. NO.  They won’t.The African is of course a front for Elite Whites, Dems, and usual suspects.  However they all want us dead.  Had a look at BLMs web page today.  All college grads, very slick.  This was to be expected from  education – any education.  As well as any economic advancement.Of course they want revenge, more from Jim Crow past and marginalization present.BLM wants the 500K Africans in the USA (actual Africans) to be citizens, etc.Now what they want of course is genocidal revenge. Bringing Africa here can duplicate the template – of South Africa.Now only a Drumhead peace is possible under present conditions, drumhead peace requires Drums.I’d say organize, but you don’t want to hear that here…so I’ll just say you all had better learn to make some dangerous friends if you want to survive.

        “There is no such thing as “systemic racism” against blacks.”Statistician William Briggs demolishes the very idea in one of the most powerful essays that I have read on this subject.https://wmbriggs.com/post/31130/Well worth your time to read this essay. One of my favorite paragraphs came early in the essay:“There is no such thing as “systemic racism” against blacks. The statements fromevery entityin the Cathedral—the web of elites who rule us—-proves it. If there was “systemic racism” emanating from the system, which is comprised of corporations, celebrities, universities, the bureaucracy, professional associations, and even weathermen, the system could never have issued all those statements condemning it. And supporting the riots.”I would like to make every school teacher in America explain this one essay.

            Thanks for the link! What pisses me off is how conservatives don’t know how to fight like Briggs.They immediately start by caving to a lie, and automatically lose as a result:https://twitter.com/PJones1776/status/1270137829134413826Listen up, conservatives: there is no separation between “good” protestors and “bad” rioters. They’re all one inseparable violent horde, and they’re all illegitimate.Listen up, conservatives: Floyd’s death was just an accident. That’s it. You don’t need to say “it’s a tragedy” just like you wouldn’t for any other mundane accident. Even more white guys suffer from accidents at the hands of police, or from outright malice at the hands of police. Whites are overpoliced relative to their crime rate and blacks are dramatically underpoliced relative to their crime rate.Listen up, conservatives: The only institutional racism that exists is against white people. Think of ANY program, organization or activity out there, whether it’s from the government, a corporation, a school/college, a nonprofit or a church. Name that program, organization or activity, and in three seconds we can give you the black-favored benefits that that program, organization or activity offers. If every single program, organization and activity in the country has benefits for blacks, we live in a black supremacist society.How the hell is it that conservatives were able to say this stuff in 2015 yet now they’ve seamlessly merged with the left?!

                There’s going to be some rate of accidental deaths associated with arrests for everyone, of every race.  Statistically, the more you get arrested, the more likely you are to be killed accidentally by the cops.  Blacks get arrested a lot, so they get killed a lot.None of that matters though.  The mass media seems to exist primarily to weave random events into a story that they’ve already written.  It’s a lot like the ancient practices of reading tea leaves or more modern things likeThe Bible Codewhere the letters of the Bible were rearranged to “reveal” all sorts of prophetic messages.  The problem is that if you know what to look for you can do the same thing with any random text.The more advanced races rose to their heights of achievement through their pattern recognition skills.  They are now being destroyed by manipulative people who happen to own media machines that can contrive whatever patterns fit their narrative.

                You have it spot on. Every organization in the US, if not all the West, is giving advantage to the Dindu. The black gets treated like princes and kings. They can kill you in the street and maybe spend a year in jail with their fellows learning the criminal trade.When the civil war comes, our problem is we will need to kill not only the non-whites but also about 1/2 the whites. How will we be able to tell the idiot liberals from the normal people?I know talk of violence is a downer, but the riots should show us all that we need to prepare.

            Sir,Please don’t think that I’m mocking you.According to “Critical Theory” the facts don’t matter, they are irrelevant. It’s about their ” feelings ” and their feelings are just as True as your facts .To make the assumption that they care about facts is to assume:1) that everyone is rational , 2) that everyone has good intentions . 3) It assumes that the only reason that people want to discuss these things is that people want to get to the truth and it assumes , 4) that the truth will win out and that people over time will abandon the false idea.There is no evidence to support these assumptions which are mere rhetoric. The vast majority of people are irrational and are not interested in the facts of a case.People don’t care if their point of view is true. They care about whether it satisfies some other requirement; financial , emotional, personal, political etc.They want your stuff . They will not be swerved !

                I can agree with all you wrote. I am familiar with the leftist only being concerned about “feelings”. They are all middle school girls.But what Briggs was doing was talking to the ones that can be reached. The “Joe Normie” who can be de-programed. I think we need to work on those we can save. The rest we will fight in the coming war.

        America used to be known for and laughed at for its bouts of  puritanical fanaticism.  Rightly or wrongly we’d be disparaged about it in our own textbooks.  Now the world sees the formerly “young, dumb &amp; crazy America” as its woke leader.Scary.  I hope some student is out there raising his hand and asking the professor, “Could this be just another cyclical phase of America going nuts?”  Of course the professor’s response would be, “Absolutely not.

        Z Man said: “When normal people, not infected by the rage virus that seems to be the root of the new religion, look at scenes likethisthey are disgusted. Why is the mayor of that city exhilarated by it? What possible reason could he have for promoting it? Why are white people literallyworshipingblack people? That’s probably the most bizarre aspect of this entire circus.”This is actually an old story. In the “jazz age” there where lots of white people adopting black music, black dance styles, black mannerisms and black drugs. In the 50s 60s ya get the same thing only more so. In the 60s there were lots of little hippie girls and Hipster girls proudly proclaiming that they screwed black men exclusivly. Abby Hoffman said in an interview that, most people didn’t know it but the leaders of the antiwar movement had taken a lot of their marching orders from the leaders of the black power movement. I think some of this crap comes from the idea of the noble savage.Death is one of the main reasons Civilisation will never stay in one piece. One generation follows another. Four or five generations out and few people even know or care who their ancestors where. There’s no fixing that.Here’s a seventeen minute video by historian Will Durant on the fall of Rome. It’s worth watching.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_vAcaSqWVk

        True enough. Now, what should Whites do about it? I suggest stealth and guile while consolidating and networking. Prepare to take command of one’s territory in the most diffuse and subliminal manner possible. This is how our enemies got us into this position and we will need to use it against them.

            That’s going to require the military. Probably a good thing that Trump’s promise to deploy them was his usual bluster. Though I wonder about where the troops to be withdrawn from Germany will end up.One thing to remember. The US empire requires the mutually reinforcing pillars of the US dollar and the US military. If the US military has to deploy substantial assets to maintain domestic control, the empire is toast.

                It probably would require the military. My comment was admittedly written in a moment of exasperation. But there are not many cases in history where anarchy and chaos do not lead to strongman rule. The Arabs, experts in this if nothing else, have that famous saying “give me a thousand years of tyranny before one day of anarchy”.But for sure, I dont know what the future holds. The present already looks like a bad, post-modern action movie.

        We don’t realize that the Aztec Empire was a Mesopotamian colony.The Atlantic seaboard, from Cretan copper mines in Michigan, to labyrinths in Illinois, to large-scale masonry, highways, advanced astronomy and astronomical math, and irrigation in CentroAmerica, were carbon copies of pre- and Bronze age culture.The mound complexes in Mississippian Cahokia and Louisiana were supposedly done with mussel shells and the shoulderblades of elk.Yet no other Indian population in two continents developed these duplicates.Only sites accessible to Mediterranean seafarers. (Crete ships reached as far east as Indonesia. Thor Heyerdahl proved deep ocean could be done with reed boats.)Also- they were likely cannibals, with human sacrifice.In every Aztec town were large cages of men and women. You could pick one out, they would be butchered on the spot for tonight’s dinner.This is what the Spanish Catholics found. The mad priests tortured their victims for days before sacrificing them.That is what happens when the Usual Suspects, the Infected, have no killer Aryans to stop them. Do any wonder now at my enmity?  Christian pastors imprisoned in Soviet bloc countries reported witnessing satanic-like rituals.This will be our future- but the Aztecs will have vaccine labs, fusion center surveillance and a military industrial complex.

        T his is just a wild-ass guess.  if we get enough radicals, we risk getting a civil war. Of course the differences are many, but do we get an outcome like the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s? A right-wing fascist dictator? A Francisco Franco of our own? Many people on the right would welcome that.

            Franco set up a return to the monarchy. History books will tell you he overthrew a democratically established government. The truth is this democratic government was simply a front for communism. Similar to Chile with Pinochet, Franco recognized this and he saved his country from that evil. Being burned once he was not about to turn the government over to a democratic process that went so wrong in the first place. Fortunately, Spain matured under the Franco and the King and became stable enough to balance the democratic process with freedom. Chile seems to have some rough going as of late however.

                Yes, mostly matches the history I learnt while studying Spanish Lit. One of my profs, no doubt muy liberal :), also said that more Spanish diedafterthe war than during! I will leave it as an exercise to the reader whether a Communist government is bad, if it was democratically elected. Having obtained an MA (granted not in history) I know laughably little about Spain. One of the best (non-course) books I’ve read isHomage to Catalonaby1984‘s George Orwell. I didn’t detect anything “wrong” in his narrative, in fact it is a war memoir with typical dry English humour 🙂 While Franco was certainly a hardass in his early years, his “dictadura” (dictatorship) grandually mellowed into a “dictablanda” (soft dictatorship) and he was prescient enough to hand el gobierno to a democracy in mdi-70s.

        Good point about Nixon thinking a revolution could possibly take place during the 1960’s turbulent period. The deal is those hippies actually got an ass whoopin from their parents now and again, they knew better.The idiots today are too far gone for just ass whoopins to do any good.They don’t know better.Unfortunately I fear it will ultimately take far more severe measures to stop where this is going.

        From Kunstler’s, by Pucker:“wonder what Michael Rockefeller would say about defunding the Minneapolis Police Department?“Pep didn’t hesitate. He was surrounded by relatives and fellow villagers, and his status was built on how bold he was, how many people he killed, how many heads he took. He howled and arched his back and drove his spear into the white man’s floating ribs. Michael screamed, groaned a deep, inhuman sound. They hauled him up into the canoe, blood spurting from the wound. They knew what they were doing, had done it dozens of times before, were following sacred rules that prescribed every step of what they were about to do, rules that defined them. Made them men. Made them whole. For they were about to take his power, become him, and restore balance to the world. The fifty men rowed south on the Arafura Sea, standing up in a line in each canoe, the most important men at the stern and bow, the places of hardest work. Their shoulders and triceps rippled; sweat poured off their chests and foreheads; their backs glistened in the sun. They sang, shouted “Wo! Wo! Wo!” as they clacked their paddles on the sides of the canoe and blew bamboo horns that sounded like eerie foghorns. They laughed. They chanted “Wo! Wo! Wo!” over and over again. They were filled with adrenaline and purpose, the white man’s hot blood mixing with the water in the canoe, sloshing around their bare feet. A few miles south of the Ewta River, they turned left, into a barely perceptible cut in the shoreline. Here the ocean was silvery over the black mud, long banks of which ran along the shore. The jungle was thick green on all sides, nipa palm and mangrove roots like claws in the water. Flocks of sulfur-crested cockatoo flew overhead, screaming. The cockatoos ate fruit, and Pep and Fin and Ajim were like them, for they, too, ate fruit—human heads. Human heads were the fruit of men and powerful symbols of fertility, precious seeds that blossomed, grew, died, and from which new men sprouted. As they turned into the inlet—a deserted, beautiful place with small white waves rolling in, the mud shining in the sun and the river water brown, a place that had never seen an engine or a radio, a place where the spirits dwelled—they were about to acquire a powerful new seed: Michael Rockefeller’s head. There was no beach, just a brief shoreline of thick, soft mud the color of ash. They dragged the white man out of the canoe and slapped him on his skull. “This is my head!” screamed Fin, as the others gathered around, shouting and taunting. Michael was limp, gravely injured, blood oozing from his mouth, matting his wet beard. Fin and Pep and Ajim held his chest off the ground and pushed his head forward and with one blow of an ax in the back of his neck, Michael Rockefeller was dead. Ajim turned him over and thrust into his throat with a bamboo knife, then pressed the head back until the vertebrae cracked. Man, pig, it was all the same now—Michael was sacred meat. As others gathered dead branches from the forest and lit them with coals from the canoe, Fin made a deep cut from Michael’s anus to his neck, through one side of his trunk to his armpit, across the collarbone to his throat, and down the other side, exactly as the ancestors had instructed them how to butcher a man. Blood ran everywhere, soaking their hands, clotting on their arms, spattering their legs. Flies too, buzzing and swarming by the thousands. Fin broke Michael’s ribs with an ax, put his hand underneath his sternum, ripped it loose, and put it aside. Ajim twisted his legs and arms and cut them off and then pulled out Michael’s entrails with a vigorous jerk. Fifty voices chanted and sang in unison, a powerful, earthy rhythm that might have been the pulse of the mud and the trees themselves. It was sacred violence. The fire was crackling and smoking and hot, and the pieces of meat were placed in it to roast. When it was done, they pulled the charred legs and arms out of the fire, tore the meat off the bones, and mixed it with crumbly whitish-gray sago into long sticks for everyone to eat. Their hands were slippery with precious grease and fat, some of which they saved in small woven bags. If this had been a normal killing of a fellow villager just a few years earlier, they would have taken the body back to the village for the elaborate, shameless ritual that should ensue. But times were changing. This was a white man, and this had to be done now, here, in secret. They held the head over the fire just long enough to scorch the hair. Fin took the burned hair and mixed it with the blood they’d saved, which they all smeared over each other’s heads, shoulders, and bodies, even their anuses. They were coated in Michael Rockefeller. When the head was cooked, they scalped it, cut across its face from the root of the nose to the nape of the neck, and as they did this they talked about what Michael had been doing when he was alive. “He was eating fish yesterday,” said Pep. “He was swimming,” said Fin, “and now he is dead.” Ajim cut a hole about two inches in diameter into Michael’s right temple with a stone ax. The ax had a name, a new one. Its name was Mike. They shook the brains out onto the leaf of a palm, scraped inside the skull with a knife to get every last bit, then mixed the mass with sago, wrapped the leaf up, and roasted it on the fire. This food was special. Only Pep, Fin, Ajim, and Dombai, the most senior men there, ate it. It tasted rich. It was hard to be full in Asmat, and they were all now full. Finally they could rest, sleep without fear. They wrapped the skull in banana leaves, tucked it into Fin’s canoe, and paddled home.”Carl HoffmanSavage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller’s Tragic Quest”

                That’s what a lot of people miss in this rhyming game we play. We are not about to relive the sacred WW2 mythos.Fascism relied on an entire generation having combat experience. A world war had seen the old conservative monarchies washed away by huge state controlled total war economies. It was enough to make a socialist dream of uniting his highly regional nation in a massive centralized state.We don’t have a massive population of combat veterans. That describes maybe 1 percent of our population.

                    This is true. Fortunately albeit harshly, a small minority of that one percent have skills in the uses of chemical and biological weapons (the Surveillance State probably has them under watch already). That will be the only way to level the playing field if they can pull it off. The Francoists prevailed in the Spanish Civil War only because they disregarded all conventions against use of chemical weapons, to give one example.

                            It would be tactically irrational to invade a country that is committing mass suicide when you can simply wait a few more years and roll the tanks right in unopposed.Once we’ve regressed to ooking and eeking and throwing shit at PCs and other technological devices it won’t be much challenge to grab this highly desirable land mass for resources / real estate.

                                they’ll make noise about wanting Alaska back … I can think of worse thingsAlaska is one of my potential retirement destinations. When I stuff my patent law shingle in the drawer I may be flying floatplanes with my former jump buddy. That’s what he does now and I wouldn’t mind flying pax and cargo in Alaska. So a Russian occupation and seizure would probably interfere with my plan, and it’s a “worse thing” for me as I’m not licking Russian boots. Unless you have a prettier locale with winter weather this acceptance of relinquishing Alaska does not wash in this house.

                        And I never imagined 10-20-30-40+ years ago that I would also cheer them on.If Russia had been (or would be) consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary — as required by Fatima — that “roll” would be Europe’s salvation … even if they overstay their welcome by one or two generations (again).But even without the Consecration, such a move would be exponentially better than the retrogressive insanity and Middle Eastern Filth that is there now and in England.

                            The promise at Fatima was fulfilled, though. Russia WAS reconsecrated to Holy Mother Church. That’s why Bolshevism was overthrown. It will take time, however. Be patient, my friend. The Holy Orthodox Church founded by Jesus Christ will prevail!

                        A technique the Weimar Republic would use to great success.But that isn’t the point. 1920s society had already experienced a form of national socialism. Ludendorff had all but deposed the Kaiser during WW1 and ruled the German state.Mussolini had his own history with the unification of Italy, republicanism and socialism. An entire generation had been kicked out of the socialist movement becuase they enlisted in a bourgeois war that failed to bring about the global revolution.The ingredients for fascism aren’t present today.

                            One can always improve, thanks, but I’ve been involved for a long time now in such things. Not the best of my group, but not without some understanding/experience. I don’t “advise” others falsely.Been in the field along our border humping a rifle with others of such ilk. It’s a young man’s game, and young were most others—but not all. Some will call it LARPing, that’s your call. I take no offense. But when you are walking across country in the middle of the night, with no help for thirty miles, it “adjusts” your thinking.https://youtu.be/oeEjxbu_rcEThe above video brings back memories. I helped set up and maintain the cameras in that particular location. I recognize the site, so I include it here for this group’s amusement. There are many other videos which I had no hand in, so credit goes to others. Details as to what happens when detection occurs, I keep secret. But the videos have been approved, edited, and posted by others so I can share.There are videos which I can not find right now showing such groups being led by armed guides. Such was the nature of these smugglers. And hence the need for bearing arms.Enjoy. It’s not today’s topic of discussion, but in a sense I think pertinent. Seems a lot of people think folk in these troubled times are going to bend the knee. Bullshit.

                    Fascism also relied on Communism, and we certainly have that out being very active in the streets.If only 1% have combat experience than the next question is how much of that 1% do they have, how much do we have?  If not how much can we get?I’m not quite sure about 1% but that’s not really a constraint.It’s actually closer to 14 million veterans with the training to do the job, perhaps 3 million have been under fire.Our real problem is we don’t organize while the Left does.That’s what has made all the difference.   People here keep talking about swaying normies – as if that matters.

        so the nigs and mexicans take over the dem party — and all of the whites are now voting Trump.   fund raising for the dems falls off a cliff, and the party splits because nigs and mexicans hate each other.the pandemic bullshit actually inoculated the country against further leftist shut downs.   by letting the protests happen — during the shut down — they nullified any credibility for future shut downs.   plus the normies learned how to march on a capital.the cities are shit holes and will stay that way, but i think they will lose all political power.  a lot of the browns will self-deport over the next couple of years, too.I think the unusual activity Zman is talking about here, is more do to with Trump’s faction coming in for the kill.  The cabal is throwing up all kinds of chaff to distract everyone, but none of it is working as hoped.  don’t think the dems can do their usual october surprise thing, because they have been doing that continuously since Trump got in.   but i think Trump can drop a fukkin’ bomb on the dems and rinos, with indictments and arrests a month out.  watch all those dirty gop senators get right into line after seeing Burr et als shredded.

            “I think Trump can drop a fukkin’ bomb on the dems and rinos, with indictments and arrests a month out. watch all those dirty gop senators get right into line after seeing Burr et als shredded.”What kind of fevered delirious fantasy is this? Trump isn’t going to do anything.

            “and all of the whites are now voting Trump”Have you turned on the news or read a website in the past week? What are you on about? Whites are the ones propelling this both Dem and Repub. You are living in an alternate reality either out of fear or retardation, doesn’t really matter either way. Reality wins.

            There will be more than enough Jews to fund and control the party. Hell, they ran the NAACP for years and when they relaxed their control, the NAACP almost went bankrupt.
