        I was thinking about something similar earlier today. Our civilization isn’t doing well these days, and our leaders are to blame. Things suck. But, I still have my job, my wife and I have a vacation planned, and I’m pretty healthy, all things considered.Will it be that way the rest of my life? Probably. The leaders will still jack off and screw things up, as has been the case forever, and people will live their lives.Sometimes I tell myself to quit following the news, Nd just do my thing. But then I see a picture of our president eating an ice cream cone for Memorial Day, and I get steamed again.I just want to live my life in peace. Is that asking too much?
