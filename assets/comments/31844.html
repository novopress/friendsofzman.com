        “It could send the system into crisis and open the door for a real opposition. It could end up with Hitler, but is the death of the West by Hitler really any worse than its death by bad management? After all, death is death, no matter the cause.”
Been there… Trump.Now what?

        I’m always about 10 years ahead of my time.  Back during the Romney 2012 debacle and even the 2010 sequestration fraud I was writing that the best way to move forward is to destroy the GOP.  Drives me up the wall when the CivNats at places like CTH insist we have to co-opt the GOP.  It’s never going to happen.The better play has always been a purge and a new party.  There are millions of people who affiliate with “Democrats” who would vote for a MAGA agenda if they didn’t have to vote for those shtbag Republicans.I’ve been saying on this site as well that I think 2024 might be the last election featuring the GOP as a viable party.  They’re all falling in behind Trump now, and the disqualification crap has faded.  But many of them (Pence, Romney) are saying they won’t vote Trump.  It’s quite likely that 2-3 Senators switch parties to deny Republicans a majority next year.Stuff like that is a party that is dead.  The survivors will survive on the carcass for a bit longer.Kill the GOP, save the world.

        The dishonesty of the contemporary political system is a common theme for many of Z’s recent posts. The ruling class is lying about everything, be it Ukraine war,  domestic economy or the benefits of limitless immigration.I think lying about money is one aspect preceding this utter corruption of the ruling class. Over the years, US dollar lost all ties with gold, and thus could be created infinitely without doing any honest work. So, the best way to get rich has been to stay as close to the money spigot, and then hide through lyimg the real purpose of creating this limitless money from the population. Lying about money led to all other forms of lying.It is clear that this trend of creating fake money cannot go on for ever without completely destroying the society, and some of Z’s posts speculate on how the current period will end. Unlike libertarians, I do not think the system will get magically fixed through people “voting to go back to gold”. What I expect instead is a massive financial crisis to be the real impetus for fixing the system. Nature will create a solution, when the humans refuse to come to senses on their own.

            “What I expect instead is a massive financial crisis to be the real impetus for fixing the system.”
The WEF has this very plan. It isn’t even a question of “who,” though, and more of a “can” question, in the sense of “can the economic system be fixed?” My guess is the system cannot be fixed, WEF-style or otherwise, and the economic reckoning will usher in a new, brutish Dark Age. Nature’s solution will be a harsh one.

                The WEF plan is to use the financial crisis to tokenize everything, including legacy national currencies, and roll them into a global CBDC they control.

                    This century so far has been about the conversion of *everything* into surveillance. Our nouveau hyper-rich are the men who’ve pioneered it. The future is terrible beyond even their psychotic imagining.

        Since I’m allegic to sports, especially foreign ones,  I have no idea what “pulling the goalie” means.
What language is this?  Jai-alai?  Lacrosse?  Footie?

                In his defense, footie was also a good guess as pulling the goalie of sorts happens as well – usually when comes up to participate in a corner kick awarded to his team on the last play of the game.   Actually saw a goalie score once on such a play to tie up the match.

        Back in the 90s, the Canadian version of the Republicans (the Progressive Conservative Party) collapsed. It was replaced with a coalition of two Center Right parties and business continued as usual. It is the liberal democratic system that is the problem, not any specific party. It will always be a system dominated by the highest bidders with the lowest ethical standards. Its politicians are a deplorable mixture of demagogue and prostitute. We are getting a good dose of that now. The GOP leadership’s top priorities are the continued funding of the insane Ukraine War and the re-authorization of FISA, the domestic spy program. Those happen to be the top priorities of the Dem leadership too.

            Precisely. I can hang in there without electricity for maybe a month, but after that I’m going to want my HVAC back and a nice hot shower, to be followed by a comforting Bach concerto and a glass of cognac. A Dark Age would be so gauche.

        I love watching election results with beer, the next UK and Irish elections will see some great scenes, lot of Tory clowns will lose their seats, the Irish elections will be similar, but the down side in Ireland is a lot of politicians are not standing again, so we a being denied the chance of voting them out.

        The fact is, “the right” is not the right, and it really is not an acceptable alternative to the left, because it is the left. I am done with controlled opposition/conservacuck/MIGA politicians. It is MAGA/America First or nothing. I just see no evidence that conservacucks who never conserve anything are better than just voting for the left. If you love unlimited open borders, you vote for the left. If you hate unlimited open borders, well don’t vote for the right, because they secretly love unlimited open borders and also cheer on Israel while it drops bombs on Gazan nurseries. It’s just a waste of time. If anything I hate the conservacucks more than I do the left. At least the left has gone full mask off recently.As an aside, I’ve never seen the pull the goalie thing work. I get why they do it, but it feels like 9 times out of 10 the other team just gets weird shot that slowly meanders into the goal.

            Pulling the goalie (in the NHL) works about 15% of the time, if you are  one goal behind, so at least it gives you a chance to tie the game and potentially win in overtime. Sadly for us, the proper analogy is we are 3 goals down and it’s late in the game so the chances, even if we pull the goalie, are almost zero. However you will lose for sure if you do nothing so what the hell, give it a whirl!This is why Tom A is (unfortunately) correct in that there is no real solution to the present crisis in that the system will not allow for a course correction and a quick collapse gives the best chance for us to survive in the long run.In Canada, we have Trudeau bringing in over a million third worlders every year and the media completely ignores what effect transferring a million people a year to a high carbon economy from low carbon economies even though this is supposedly our existential crisis. Our “conservative” leader says that he will bring this number of immigrants down to 950,000 so problem solved! It really is the damndest thing to watch and wonder how any sentient being can ignore the schizophrenic hypocrisy.

        – Regarding trying to fix the Tory and Republican parties:Imagine an old house. The foundation is cracked, the roof is leaking, there’s mold in the ductwork and basement, and nothing is up to code. Sure, you could try to fix it. Others have tried, and all failed, to handyman the house back into a liveable state. After a certain point the house is more trouble than it is worth. Sometimes the best thing that could happen to the house is a bulldozer so that something new can be built in its place.– Regarding the Tory and Republican party losing all of their power and things getting worse:I am trying to get back in shape and lose a significant portion of weight. It sucks, my body hasn’t adjusted to less food and more exercise, so I’m always hungry, sore, and in a bad mood. But either I suffer now and push through, or I suffer later when they cut my feet off because of sugar diabetes. It is the same here. Either there is suffering now in our time, forcing the issues and the politcal landscape to adjust, or there will be much greater suffering later.

Make sure you’re getting in enough protein. Baseline is one gram per pound of desired goal weight.  I can say from personal experience being on top of the protein takes the edge off.
I know that ruins the analogy and whatnot, but that’s okay.

        Disaffection with the “establishment” is hardly exclusive to the right. The only thing holding the leftist coalition together presently is TDS. Absent that, they’ll be doing some goalie pulling of their own. Isn’t it interesting that after decades of the DR’s failure to do so, the left has suddenly managed to make antisemitism edgy and cool. So it is already happening. Unlike Gottfried, and many of us on the right who are worried about holding on to what we have, they take what they have for granted, so there is no such fear of how things could get worse by upsetting the applecart. In the place where we have that fear, they have only the dream of CHANGE.

        When radical change is necessary, things getting worse is ALWAYS a possibility. This is what Gottfried doesn’t understand. You don’t have to go to mustache man, but of course, he does. Some other relevant examples:When the USSR collapsed, Russia went through terrible poverty and malaise in the 90’s. It had to go through this to get to the other side stronger. Gottfried in USSR circa1989 would have said, “let’s try to fix this system, because worse is worse.”In the American revolution, the colonies could have endlessly petitioned the king and hoped for a better deal, but they likely would have been told to pound sand and accomplished nothing. They risked everything. If they failed, the gallows almost certainly awaited, as well as harsher treatment of all the colonies.Meaningful change cannot happen with such an aversion to risk and unwillingness to ride out bad times.

        What might be good for Britain might be very terrible for the US. For example, the current Regime here is endorsing the squatter’s movement of illegals seizing homes from owners (often waiting till the owners run an errand or even just swarming in and throwing the owners out). This is not just happening in middle class areas but the Hollywood Hills, the house next to LeBron’s has been seized this way. DeSantis got Florida to pass a law against this, with the Regime upset at the action and promising counter-action.Britain is small. It has Hindus vs. Muslims in its vibrant immigrant class. It can look to Scotland where all crime is now legal, all the time, as the police spend all their time investigating mis-gendering due to the law passed making it a crime. Scores are being settled massively. Britain has now got itself into a War with Russia, which is much bigger than itself, and closer to the UK than protector US. Britain will have many, many problems as a result, it would be best to wait and see.The US is larger. It faces a larger problem, the utopian desire to make YT into Uighurs, bluntly, by the clouds. With a much bigger and limitless group of enforcers from South America, China, and Africa.As such I want ANY barrier, even one not very good, as a defensive measure against myself ending up in Manzanar Plus with “In This Together” or some such Cloud slogan. Even poor defensive works can slow down an assault. So I want an Abbot, a DeSantis, even a squish like Youngkin can have their uses.My risk is not the risk of the average White Person in the UK. Their small size, small stakes, and divisions in their vibrants makes their risk to Uighur Plus much lower than mine. Thus for them, have at it with zero votes. For me, I want any defensive barrier I can get. My risk is much higher.

            I’ve always thought that Europe (especially UK) is way more screwed than America (and Canada) long term. Here are my reasons:– low fertility migrants, majority non- Islamic. In Canada migrants now have lower birth rates than whites . Hispanics drop over time too in the US– higher concentration of Christian conservative communities means increased power centers and control outside of the feds / mainstream culture– higher skepticism towards foreigners. Not necessarily outright hostility but there is less naivete. Much higher concentration of Bad white / MAGA / disaggreableness genes or whatever you want to call it.– generally a bit more “sandpaper” among whites in the Americas for whatever reason . We are just tougher and more rugged– way more space to spread out here . You’re not crammed in with vibrant s even if the overall demographics have shifted– further away from Africa / middle east means that when we do get our border under control, it will stay that way.Frankly I could see English people being almost entirely wiped out by 2100, while whites in the Americas are reduced to a minority but still existing and doing our thing in various communities.

                I largely agree with you. Unfortunately, though, so does the Regime. Hence, we see in Dirt areas the proliferation of Colony Ridges to act as Fort Apaches. I don’t think these will work out, mind you, and the invaders eventually will flow to Blue hives with more welfare benefits (the original magnet to come at all). But in the interim, those outposts could make things very nasty.I have not given up fully on the United Kingdom, but the window is closing fast to stop what you mentioned. Whether the native Brits win or lose, the lesson will not be lost on North Americans and continental Europeans. This in part may explain the furious push for total censorship although it is hard to see that information being contained to Britain.I am really concerned about what the United States/NATO will do in response if the indigenous British do push back. Everything will be on the table for them.

                The way I see it, America vs. Europe is basically the difference between turning up the heat on the frog slowly (America) or quickly (Europe). Except the European citizens are too enfeebled to hop out of the boiling pot. The speed at which these countries have transformed – and this includes Canada and Australia – is just mind-blowing to me. Germany has functionally been changed forever because of, like, 2 years of mass migrant invasions. This tells me that the GAE kept Europe as, well, Europe as a conscious decision and then decided it wasn’t necessary anymore. Most likely, like so much else, the changeover happened with the end of the cold war. A strong, healthy, diverse (in the real sense of the word) Europe was good for opposing the USSR, but after that, it now needs to turn into globohomo.

The Cold War never ended.
The Wall fell, but the asset stripping and NATO expansion began right away.  We’re 33 years into the next 50 years of the Cold War.
Since I agree with Mycale- “Europe was good for opposing the USSR”- I don’t know how to square this circle, other than to say the bad guys won?
Or perhaps, moved.  Won the West and lost the USSR?

        The ending of this post is interesting as it is related to a sport. As there is much ridicule of “sportsball” in certain circles, the author wraps up the topic with a sports analogy. It is a circle then – sportsball, the opiate of the masses and a much ridiculed activity, directly figures in to the political discussion.
Interesting … oh wait – ice hockey is “sports puck” isn’t it?

            It’s entirely possible to employ sports metaphors without endorsing watching the sport.  One might, for example, use the phrase “constantly facing third and eight,” to denote perenially facing difficult situations, without advocating for watching football.  Z-man’s use of a hockey metaphor is quite apt in this situation.

        Disregarding what would come next, GOP Zero Seats would at least create some form of accountability. At the moment, no one knows who’s in charge.Now, we all know that the real rulers are behind the scenes, but the public doesn’t even know which of their actors are pretending to be in charge. Even Putin alluded to this. They don’t know who to call. Both acting groups blame each other.GOP Zero Seats would be the first step in allowing the public to point a finger at someone or some party and say, “Those guys are supposed to be in charge.” If they turn totalitarian, so be it. They were going to anyway, but at least, the public could assign responsibility and, potentially, could know who to push back against.

            There’s a very high chance no one is in charge. As an example, we see this with China policy. Just last week, there was jingoistic saber rattling followed a few days later by Janet Yellen getting drunk with the CCP brass in Beijing. The factions seem to be jockeying constantly with no one having the upper hand. That will end only with a Night of the Long Knives, which is coming. The subsequent mop-up operation could be horrific, and it will be quite unpleasant to say the least to have been a foot soldier for the losers.Laws, rules and regulations were there primarily as guardrails for the Clouds, which they have forgotten.

                Yeah, there’s no coherent direction outside of hate whitey and open borders, but on everything else, things seem to jump one direction and then the next.You can see that with foreign policy. One faction wants to drop Ukraine (hell, drop Europe all together) and focus on China, while another faction won’t let go of Ukraine. That seems to be fight between the military and the neocons.On domestic policy, nobody seems to want to do much of anything. I think that our rulers are bored with running the country. Infrastructure, the border, tax policy, entitlements, healthcare, etc. Boring!Even the Hate Whitey campaign seems to bore our elite. They enjoyed their BLM days, but it seems a bit outdated, especially since whites are such a pathetic target. Also, some of the Hate Whitey attitude is being directed at Jews, so it needs to be toned down for now.Don’t get me wrong. They still hate us, but it’s just not as fresh and fun as it once was.When your society is run by a foreign elite who have no love for the people or the place, they tend to be a disinterested by the day to day management. And when you get squabbling factions, they’re too busy messing with each other to do much else.

(It also explains the Russia, Russia, Russia themes that are very recent in our Federal governance.) The China business is all the globalist minded Cloud people who want to keep economic party going. The move to make China globalist #1 is about by players here since the Ellis Island era and has been in motion since the 1970’s. President Xi has put a monkey wrench into those plans. If Taiwan is taken, it’s a complete route on that front.Judaic domestic and border policy exists in full force almost every where. There’s nothing to argue over from their POV, because they’ve won completely at this point. Even the social conservatives can’t be bothered with obvious problems like drug addiction/pornography. There was a tiny win with the Supreme court and undoing Roe v. Wade for the natives. Other than that, the GOP are waving pride flags and calling student loans their hill to die on.

The Regime’s foot soldiers no longer have certitude about whose orders to follow, and in the near future some of them most likely will be offered up as sacrificial lambs to forestall open conflict among factions.It truly got dangerous when they decided to take their Mean Girls act to a nuclear power. When Putin said he doesn’t know who is in charge, it wasn’t solely a propaganda point. In all likelihood the pole position changes very frequently.Again, the rules, laws and regulations originally were put into place to protect the Clouds from gang wars, as always has been the case, and that either has been forgotten or never was an impediment to the currently dominant group. It is quite the spectacle.

            “GOP Zero Seats would be the first step in allowing the public to point a finger at someone or some party and say, “Those guys are supposed to be in charge.” ”
It has the added advantage of giving the GOP the outcome they’ve obviously desired for decades on end.

        I’m coming to see the whole thing as a crisis of the middle class. Middle class is by definition mediocre, so I’m expecting the climax to be rather mediocre, too— neither overly tragic nor overly great.And maybe mediocrity is the crux of it. There’s a yearning for Rome’s collapse, for Covid to have been the Black Death, for America to have been Rome, for God’s holiness, a reckoning of Good and Evil, etc.The Puritan ethic, right? Its success has been to make us all more mediocre, to make life more tedious, to make the times more forgettable. People seem dissatisfied with that.The crisis and its solution could amount to admitting something’s missing and demanding a change in outlook. If you stop searching for greatness and drama, you see the fake and gay, and you see that the fake and gay is the problem.

            One of the most astute observations I’ve seen on these times. I’m constantly trying to see the big picture through a lot of the doom and gloom our older colleagues constantly espouse. Speaking of Rome collapsing lets remember this was also the time of St. Patrick.

        “In Britain, as in America, there is no voting your way out of the problems of liberal democracy and there is no way to co-opt any party of the liberal democratic regime.”Let’s remind ourselves that this situation can only exacerbate, on account of endless imports from non-white nations. The demographic inevitabilities practically settle the matter for us. As Zman mentioned in one of his interviews earlier this week, we *will* become a populous, geographically vast, majority-minority society in The Nation Below Canada, and no such society has ever discovered how to make that work… but we know how it will “vote” and how those votes will be “counted.” The white dissident may or may not vote. It’s irrelevant because dissidents remain a mere rounding error in the electorate. There’s certainly no evidence for large numbers of sympathetic, viable politicians who wouldn’t immediately fink on voters as soon they enter the imperial capital. The flaw in Gottfried’s approach is our circumstances delimit what voting achieves; it’s too late for voting. Given that this is so, and the ruling class will continue to do as it pleases, perhaps the only useful approach to voting is open disdain. It’s only logical when it’s understood and analyzed as a fruitless charade.

                He was mocked as the exemplary modern house negro during his Hertz mascot days and totally disdained by the black public—until he killed his blonde wife.When people talk about the ’90s as a period of racial conciliation, they ignore many things.My white friends in LA back then all became incredibly racist, basically because they were too poor to live in the hills. Eventually they all fled the city to restore their souls. If you never see black people, you don’t have to keep that hate in your heart, right? You can hate poor white people instead, like Jesus would. Because they’re racists.

                        Perhaps they will make a triple monument with OJ brandishing a knife and chasing his wife and her boyfriend through the airport to get to the rental car counter. It certainly beats another giant mural of St. Floyd.

        A decision to pull the goalie depends on what the loss represents. The goalie is more likely to stay in place with a routine game, and more likely to be pulled if a championship rides on the outcome. As things stand at the moment, the main threat from a political loss is increased totalitarianism. People therefore continue to play by the standard rules. We see sorting and separation now, but that is simply an awareness that a loss may result in more tyranny and a desire to be as distant as possible from it. Britain for all intents and purposes is a totalitarian society now sans the Stalin, and people there indeed are the canary in the coalmine as to how much Westerners will tolerate. The opportunity to fragment in the UK is far less, too, given the population density and smaller land mass.What if a loss means hunger, deprivation or even the possibility of death camps, though? We likely are moving in that direction. Once there is enough pain, anxiety and fear among those who have migrated as far as possible from potential harm, people will pull the goalie and put another skater on the ice. It won’t happen one second earlier. This always has been the case. The game will be played routinely as long as the consequences of a loss are not intolerable. The United States isn’t quite there yet and the UK is closer.The “Left” is like the Muslims in that has been conquered must remain permanently conquered, and any loss of territory is considered illegitimate and must be retaken by any means necessary. This really is what is happening with abortion, as discussed yesterday. The Left has no reverse gear and lacks the impulse control to wait for circumstances to change.My best guess is the goalie eventually does get pulled because he has to be pulled. The question is whether it will be too late for those who have taken the preliminary precautions. I don’t know the answer to that particular question. Britain may offer some clues because backs there soon will be against the wall.

Personally I think the first western nation to crack will be France.  Their demographics vs country size is the worst of all.
They are one unpredictable riot away.   One day their will be enough agitators that the government will fall and likely beheaded

                The French Clouds would be forced to respond to Muslims threatening to take their land and wealth, no? If the Islamists are not co-opted, wouldn’t the Clouds be forced either to submit or engage in civil war? I agree there is more opportunity in France for the Muslims to carve out their own state–that kind of has happened–but I don’t think the Clouds there will lay down if actually threatened.

                France should be the target of any mindful raider.Take France, and one’s supply of nuclear material is assured.Voltaire(dot)net says:“Voloymyr Zelensky announced at the annual Munich Security Conference that he would challenge the Budapest Memorandum* in order to rearm his country with nuclear weapons.*(1994 nuclear disarmament deal)Five days later, on February 24, 2022, Russia launched its special operation against the Kiev government to implement Resolution 2202. Its top priority was to seize Ukraine’s secret and illegal reserves of enriched uranium.After eight days of fighting, the civilian nuclear power plant at Zaporijjia was occupied by the Russian army.Ukraine had secretly stored 30 tons of plutonium and 40 tons of uranium at Zaporijjia……they would have demanded more and more weapons and, if refused, threatened to use them, i.e. to launch Armageddon.”Remember, AQ Khan was an immigrant working at a Dutch nuclear plant, from which he stole the blueprints in 1987.He took them back to Pakistan.  Saudi Arabia provided the funding, Muslim Malaysia the machining, and nuclear powers under the watch of a Muslim director of the IAEA went from 5 to 15.The next phase was Mideast wars and Arab Springs to push Muslim fighters into the EU’s Shengen Zone, that is, no passports needed.(Note, an EU, euro currency, and Shengen Zone built by the same powers that promoted the wars.)The twist is that the Levantine mindset considers Sampson, Masada, or Hannibal directives as legit.  They will happily threaten to bring down the house on their own people’s heads, which was the threat in Ukraine,(and may be the implied threat in Gaza/Lebanon, as it was decades ago against Egypt.)The good news is that I consider Dimona to be Iraq WMD’s, an empty bluff.Please show me the receipts for tritium replenishment, warhead development, or missile delivery and I might believe the frenzied barking of the mad dog.

                    *for clarity, please also note that I consider Muslim arms to be proxies of the Semitic power, just as I consider Islam to be the Judaic Reformation.
Just as there is no real separation of Russia and the West, there is no real separation of the Semitic culture; the internal labels may change, but demographic blocs are what are contending for territory.

        “The “zero seats” campaign started as a joke but as is often the case, this joke could turn out to be reality. Italy’s Five Star movement started as a gag and eventually overturned the political establishment.”See: Volodimir Green (Zelenskyy)“The system of competing parties that we call liberal democracy is just theater. Both parties are beholden to the same interests and most important, they agree on all of the big issues.”This is a feature of having a permanent government in DC. Remember when Trump was getting impeached how Ukro-Khazarian Minister of Defense (((Aleksandar Vindman))) thought Trump deserved impeachment because he Ignored the “Interagency consensus?” These people are just actors who fly in to play the part of a functioning government when they don’t really do much.I don’t know what the right answer is, because as an Empire, we probably do need a sophisticated government to some degree. But the power of the permanent government has to be neutered because it has gotten way out of control. They have been ignoring the will of the American people for far too long and this is not sustainable.

            “They have been ignoring the will of the American people for far too long and this is not sustainable.”Says who?  Nobody cares what the masses think on any subject.  Obviously, they put a lot of effort into managing what a portion of the masses think.  But that just makes it a bit easier and provides opportunity for making money (an elite jobs program).   A large majority of Americans now say the border is a major issue for them.  Yet, this has had no impact whatsoever on border policy.  If anything, they are making it worse just to spite us.It is largely our own fault.  We have made ourselves a non-issue to them.  They will only care what we think if we make them care.

Here, we disagree. Westerners will always do the right thing after all other possibilities have been exhausted. TPTB have an advance peek at the future with enough time to trade and position on the information before anybody else. You cannot defeat this except by waiting for implosion which, given the quantum leap in IT, will likely never occur.

                Perhaps there is a hole in the IT/AI Death Star.
Chips.  All semiconductor chips in the world depend on the combo of two companies- Zeiss in Germany and Dutch ASML.
Without them, nanoscale chip development will not happen. Anywhere.  Even the Chinese are unable to duplicate what they do.
So, when it comes to Blackrock’s Aladdin, AI trend graphing, and robot factories (China’s can pump out a luxury EV every 76 seconds) to replace the smart White component, perhaps we have a chance to avoid being completely Kalergi’ed.

I don’t see how that would realistically work. Life is simply too complicated today. Foreign countries would take advantage of the chaotic situation in agriculture, trade and any number of little nuances where we need their expertise to protect us from the rest of the world. The trick is to keep their power in check.

                    Up vote for “The trick is to keep their power in check.”For that to happen, finance must be subordinate to the government as it is in China. In the West, finance is a horizontal layer freely abusing the other layers.That would mean the Democrat party would have to return to its racist ways and union base.  Once it was taken over by a foreign element, prosperous working class union towns were crushed by corporate aquisition, and white women were offered up as booty to open borders.  The Republican choir sang sweet lullabies in tune.That would also presume the American government working in the interests of the American-born.Perhaps monarchy in everything but name, the one-party state, is the only way for low fertility countries to counter the hordes of higher fertility countries, whose capital is solely tied up in more hungry mouths.  K versus r.Germany’s National Socialismus- entirely different from the imposed Socialism coming from the east- is what worked. It’s working now in China’s hybrid system.How to revive it in today’s Goblinist environment, when Aryan is taught to identify as Amalek?

        What the current ruling elites have to offer— prestige, power, fame, wealth, influence, and all the personal benefits that derive from them— is attractive enough to co-opt most politicians, regardless of the ideology which they believed-in when they fiirst arrived. Thus we find ourselves in the present state of affairs: where the ‘two parties’ are indistinguishable except for details.Hard to see what could change this, aside from systemic collapse. How likely is that? Hard to say…. But there are definitely better and worse places to be, when/if it should occur.So it would seem that the first step for us, is to relocate to a place where you can weather that storm when/if it arrives; and in the meantime, enjoy a good life unencumbered  as much as possible by woke-totalitarian  nonsense.Sounds like Z-man has recently done just that…..

        In short Paul Gottfried has his hands bound by the same fear that all of the, “Conservative”, establishment does. Their objective is to preserve the system – the legal regime and above all the rules of the gentleman’s debating club. What they won’t do is abandon the rules because then the system would be over. However, that proves that they need to abandon the rules. For if they abandon the rules and the system ends what does that tell you? It tells you that the other side has already abandoned the rules, and thus you don’t have the system since it takes both/all sides playing by them to have the system.By them having long abandoned the rules and you not doing so, they have you as a sitting duck. At that stage you don’t try and preserve the system, you try and preserve yourself so you can establish a new one where you are in charge and you and your enemies are separated to live under different systems. If you don’t lead that change, then they will be making the changes. In this case, you will live under their system, conquered and subjugated for regular fleecings.The tyranny isn’t coming, it is already here.If Trump gets in he must do the mass deportations that he is promising and do it at a minimum. If he gets in and doesn’t do it, it doesn’t matter if he gets in. If he doesn’t get in or he does but does not take the proper actions then the door is shut.

            This is it right here. This whole debate as framed by Gottfried ignores that our opponents are not not meeting us on fair and equal terms. They already view the situation as a ‘free fire zone’ while Con Inc is writing convoluted ROE to both somehow fix and maintain the system all at the same time. The already have the homefield advantage with nearly all institutional and cultural positions stacked; the only action forward is guerilla tactics.

        “ Putting that aside, the argument from Gottfried is familiar. No matter how terrible the right-wing party, it would be worse if they did not exist.”
I am a contrarian here.  I think if the useless right we have had since WW2 never existed, the left would never have felt the need to flood our homelands with new voters to tip the scales in their favor.  The left would have become sclerotic and boring just like the late stage Soviet Union.
The right gave just enough challenge, to motivate the left to destroy everything.

        After we sweep the establishment from power, who and what is going to replace them? The plan, Stan? Step one, operation power sweep, step two … ?, step three, good governance.
Me neither. I don’t know. History is failure all the way down. We have met the enemy and they is us, Pogo. Time to implant the brain chips and crank up the skynet AI.

            This follows on a post from last week about the future of conservatism. Post-Trump, the Republican Party is likely to morph into a “Judeochristian” nationalist party along the lines advocated by Yoram Hazony. His deracinated nationalist conservatism is the best funded and best organized of the alternatives, and is also the most compatible with the southern and midwestern evangelicals who dominate the party offices and infrastructure.In practice it will function much like the Buckleyite conservatism it replaces, meaning it will be efficient at gatekeeping and not much else. Rhetorically, it will be less libertarian and less Catholic, effectively cutting one leg off Frank Meyer’s three legged stool.In reality, it will represent the triumph of  the East Coast Straussians, having settled on a mythological Edmund Burke as their avatar, in counterpoint to the mythological Abraham Lincoln of their West Coast rivals. The Claremonsters will be reduced to a pedantic formalism, useful for appearances only, as the Constitution they fetishize is already a dead letter.The triumph is likely to be short lived, however, as National Conservatism will be a permanent minority from the get go, and do nothing to stave off collapse.  In fact, their warmongering will probably accelerate it.

        Zman invokes Sherlock Holmes, but I think John Nash can help here too.“Integral to the radical mind is “what we have we keep” which means they make a priority of preventing reactionary forces infiltrating their organizations. It is why they create controlled opposition in order to police the right facing walls of the regime.”I don’t think this is “controlled opposition” so much as it’s Nash Equilibrium cooperative competition. Rather than let anyone outside the system threaten it, they basically form a coalition against any usurpers. It makes perfect sense, so we get the Uniparty.The problem with trying to take over one party is that you have to fight both parties to take over only one. Just look at the Dems now cooperating with Mike Johnson. And we saw what the Uniparty did to Trump.I respect Paul Gottfried but I think we have to start from scratch here.

I spent a long time in federal government, close enough to the politicians to see how the sausage was actually made. I learned that one thing unites all major parties: preventing anyone outside conventional retail politics from getting inside the tent. It is very much a uniparty.

        With only reading the title of this post, my mind went directly to the current situation in USSA
The body count for the cloud people,(I won’t call them “Elite”; there is nothing elite about them), will be much higher than Mustache Man. The Covid Hoax alone will eventually claim millions.
And this country has its very own Gestapo, in the form of a certain 3 letter agency.
So yeah, it can be much worse, and will get worser.

                According to the lawsuits, the Sackler family knew their opioid product was addictive but deceived regulators and physicians into thinking it was not.What I wonder is, why did anyone believe the Sacklers? Any physician or regulator knew that opioids were addictive, period. A non-addictive one never existed and competent people would have known this on day one. The lazy and easily bamboozled regulators and physicians are just as guilty as the Sacklers. But the regulators and physicians cooperated with the lawyers to dogpile on the family to cover their own irresponsible complicity.And most of the guilty evaded responsibility and punishment thereby while making a bunch of lawyers really rich.

            It has the ugly ring of truth when they say that they find the voters disgusting for voting for them. How can you respect a people who fall for the simplest of lies, the most obvious hoaxes – they despise their voters the same way strippers despise guys paying for a lap dances, they hate that they have to demean themselves by pretending to like Brits.

        I’m all for total political disengagement.  As I responded to Eloi the other day – of course there is no guarantee that tipping over the table will put an end to the rigged game.  I don’t know of anyone here who has claimed this.  Worse is no guarantee of better – but more of today’s evil will be darker than most imagine.  Continuing to participate in the theater of voting, as if one actually has a voice and a choice, is to go gently into a very bad night.  Continuing as we have been is to guarantee that the only change is that things get much, much worse for White people, with our putative support (in the form of votes, surveys, polling, donations, and calling a congresscritter).So pull the goalie.  STOP VOTING.  Stop pretending anyone gives a damn what the supposed voters think.  The holy “American people” include about 120 million magic dirt/magic paper aliens and their spawn.  Let them vote. Let every breathless reporter at the polls see nothing but dusky numerkans.  And face the fact that your progeny’s future – if they are to have one – is not within either ‘our democracy’ nor muh representative republic.

            We are more likely to get a Mugabe than a Hitler (I should post that on my wall). To be clear, I don’t vote. I never have. I came to object via religious and libertarian beliefs, and, no, I am not one now; but Rand Paul is a great gateway drug for framing the problem in a manner outside the uniparty system.The problem with Z’s analogy of hockey is it supposes a set time frame (the 3rd quarter) with no possibility, removing overtime, of extension. I believe things will continue to get worse. I have far more contact with the youth than the average person here, and I have no hope for mass awakening. The average white’s dopamine-riddled brain is not going to effect anything.I see no hope – not the tiniest possibility of a positive outcome. That informs my outlook. Pull the goalie or not, loss is inevitable. The reason I do not want to accelerate the process is that I hope I can enjoy the somewhat acceptable conditions for as long as possible. To return to the hockey analogy, I am hoping to extend the game for as long as possible in order to delay the inevitable crush. This is not normalcy bias, for I do not lose perspective on the declining situation, and my outrage does not minimize with time. Further, I do not hide this from my kids. I teach them the things we say at home and the things we never say in public. I work to insulate them from as many prospective blows as possible, not ‘putting my head in the sand’ as I was accused of the other day.Some would label this defeatism or fatalism. Someone said to me that I need a tribe. Who says I do not? I recognize that Z must have hope, or he would not have the prodigious output he does (and, as an aside, I subscribe for even more content). I am not dismissive, either, but I would suggest that this sense of hope for the future is predicated on a cyclical view of nature. I, though, sorely and sadly, lacking devotion, cannot help but agree with Christian eschatology’s view that things will continue to get worse. They will get so bad that the only thing that prevents full destruction is God’s intervention.In the meantime, I try to prepare as much as reasonable for navigating the increasingly bad days.

                Eloi: Thank you for so eloquently explaining your position.  I largely agree with you – I, too, have no hope of ‘mass awakening’ or faith that Whites will somehow return to self respect and self confidence.  If there is to be survival, it will be a remnant after a lot of blood.  And I won’t be around to see it – but my sons and grandson will.I fully understand your desire to keep your family fed and safe at night as long as possible.  I just think it won’t be possible sooner rather than later.  I suppose I’d like some Whites to retain enough self respect to jettison belief and participation in the system for history to at least make note of.

                Eloi and 3gThank you for expressing not defeatism, but REALISM.  The good guys don’t always win and the superhero doesn’t always get the girl.  America has been conquered, it is never being fixed, Whites are never regaining their homeland and as bad as it is now, it will be 100x worse in the next 10-20 years.  There is no stopping it.  For it to be stopped, great sacrifice would need to be made, and it’s not going to happen.Life is for living.  There is nothing wrong with making the best of this life – enjoy family, your passions, your wealth – whatever that may be.  There is nothing you can do to stop the avalanche.  That is facing reality, it is not accepting defeat.

This encapsulates why I want a non-Christian right.
You refuse to wield power, learn the practical rules of the world, stand up for yourself or fight back.
You are dependent on miracles to survive.  Someone like you is a liability and not at ally.  Also I don’t want you spreading your beliefs to make more people dependent on miracles.

        “ In the context of our politics, abandoning the establishment right is the same as pulling the goalie in that it opens the door to more good outcomes…”Yes, but that is terrible analogy. In hockey, when you’re down and the last minutes of the last period are ticking away… you pull the goalie, you put your power players on and one more for good measure. You get IN the game, not out. And you play to win.What our side is doing is packing up, going home and conceding the game. The power players on our side are guys like Trump and Elon Musk…and our side throws more trash at them and boos and hisses at them louder than Lefty. Everyone bitches, nobody DOES anything and if they do they get excoriated for it by bums that sit on their hands on the sidelines and heckle. Their part in The Great Liberal Morality Play is that of the to old geezers up on the balcony at the muppet show.Let us have some clarity around here. Everything, right up to and including slavery – is a choice. This crap from the left, the vibrants and the jews goes on because WE let it. And of course it will get worse… why would you expect it not to? Organisms that don’t fight for their own survival die. Let us have some clarity here.All this goes away when we band together and stop tolerating it. We have to take ownership of the problem. We have to dismantle the systems that fail and build new ones. We are going to have stretch the necks and bust the skulls responsible for those failures, and we’ll need to do that as a group. We’ll get there, eventually. But as usual, getting there means far more casualties in the long run. It’s a pity we have neither the wisdom or ambition to do it now when it would be much easier.

            Filthie:  I know you’ve shared the tragic story of how your daughter was lost to sexual deviancy and wokism.  But do you have other children whose future you are trying to protect?  In theory, I applaud your call to action.  Certainly, women got out of control because men permitted them to.  But they also had help and encouragement and funding from ‘outside agitators.’A populist mob stretching necks is a lovely vision, but reality is Joe and Jane Normal – content enough with their public school and mortgage and house full of cheap chinesium.  You aren’t going to get what’s left of the American White middle class to join a populist mob until they’re homeless and hungry.  And even then – it’s likely that Joe and Jane Junior will have joined the woke mob because of public school and social media.  And meanwhile all of government, corporatism, the media, the ‘academy,’ and the military remains united against any genuine change.  And they are still hunting and arresting J6ers and people praying in their cars.Your faith in the common sense and resolve of ‘the common man’ is touching, and I wish I could share it.

                I agree, 3g4me, but what then are we to do?Voting doesn’t work.Not voting doesn’t work.Revolution won’t work since we are outnumbered and out gunned.What’s left Sherlock? Quite elementary, my dear Watson.  Separation.“When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.”

                    WCiv911:  I only wish I knew.  I am no leader, just an old lady with a smattering of hard-learned lessons.  If any situation requires me to ‘bet’ on other people, experience has taught me not to depend on anyone (other than my husband and 1-2 genuine friends I wholeheartedly trust).  But . . . I also have a genuine faith in God, and my experience of situations where He has created good out of what others intended for evil.I genuinely believe people ought not to put any faith, hope, trust, or participation in the system or ‘the people.’  What to do, what exactly comes next ?  That’s up to better and wiser men.

That’s up to better and wiser men.”There are certain fundamental truths/actions I believe are always of value, regardless of how “bad” things become or your stage in life or simply the end stage of this s**tshow.A quick thought: broadly, you can keep yourself *healthy*, *informed*, *independent*…. TomA has in the past commented here with many good ideas.There certainly are more readers can add.  However, in any event, which ever way the winds carry us, we can be of no help to ourselves or others if we are unhealthy, or poorly informed/ educated, or indebted to/dependent upon others.In short, look in the mirror and perfect/improve yourself.  The only control you have in this world is, in the end, of yourself.  Then, if there does arise a “Superman” in the future to lead a White Renaissance you can be of aid, rather than a hindrance.That’s the homespun philosophy than gets me up each morning, YMMV.  Live for something, despair is not living, it’s slow death.

                        The Power Structure is weakening, undermined by its irrationalist contradictions and the growing imcompetence of its architects. As this process moves apace, they will not be able to prevent separation.
As a man who is so angry that he desperately wants to strike a blow right now, I am nevertheless forced to admit to myself that the wisest faculty to cultivate is patience. Time is on our side. It may be the only thing on our side.

                        @Ostei:I one hundred percent agree with this take. In fact, the scenario you are laying out is exactly the one unfolding. People are either too whitepilled and believe a revolution is near or too blackpilled to see what is unfolding.Your counsel to patience is wise. And, yes, it is frustrating since the time schedule is not determined by us. I even catch a hint here and there that some Regime elements are aware things are spinning out of their control.Picking up on that last, I close with my usual caveat that this also may all end in a mushroom cloud because those in power, or at least many if not most of them, are psychopaths and truly evil people who will destroy what they cannot control.

                    There is no living with Leftists. That much is abundantly clear. They’ve destroyed everything decent and beautiful in the West and their malignancy seems only to batten on the destruction, not to be slaked. That being the case, here are the options:
1. Separation2. Subjugation to Leftists3. Extermination by Leftists4. Mutual extermination
Of those options, the only one that is palatable, indeed desirable, is separation. We must plan and ultimately act accordingly.

                I am always open to honest rebuke and correction, 3g. But I am not relying on faith alone. All I have to do is sit back and laugh and eat popcorn as the Regime shoots itself in the balls.The current status quo is untenable. Our regime is shot through with sexual degenerates, liars, thieves, and psychopaths. The institutions have been hijacked and produce more every day. The media, the schools, the military, the courts – all are vassals to a regime dominated by (((people))) that hate us but pose as our friends. They have been kicked out of every country they ever settled in. Their minions and lickspittles can ape the simpler actions of leadership but nothing else. They are problems that will solve themselves. Nastily. Painfully. History is clear on that point. Something HAS to give.It’s funny that you mentioned my daughter. In my little corner of the world, when my daughter confronted me with her homosexuality and demands and ultimatums I refused to submit and told her she could come back and see me once she grew up and was making sense. I had done all I could to save her; but she was an adult and now on her own.I spent my life frugally saving and over the years I had carefully set aside some funds for her. It took me three decades but I had enough money for her so she could buy a nice starter car and maybe put a good down payment on a home. When she flipped out I kept up with those funds mostly out of habit. I kept at it for another 5 years and then faced reality and accepted it. My daughter was never coming home and if she did she would never repent or apologize or redeem herself. Then I just said, “Screw it! That’s the way it is, and it is what it is!” I put in my notice and retired early, and if I properly manage that money I should not have to hit on my RRSP’s until my 70’s. I doubted myself on it for years, wondering if I were being too cruel in spending what I had meant to be her money.i used to spy on my daughter over the internet years ago. The father in me still worried about his daughter back then. I came across one of the forums she frequented and I lurked. She and her friends were cheerleading for one of their gang who had just had her tits cut off and was transitioning to be a man. It was the last time I checked in on her, really. If I ever see her again it will be in the next world. We probably won’t get along there either.For this world, I am well prepared and willing to be happy to have as little to do with it as possible, and let the world do what it has to do. If it blows up and jewish bankers get all my money and the cops start rounding up dissidents and putting them in camps… fine by me. I have still more options and plans in place in case that happens… but it would be fed-poasting to go into details.I may not be able to protect you, my daughter or anyone else… but I CAN look after myself and my own liberty and happiness and will do so most enthusiastically if I see the need for it.If we all start just looking after ourselves and safeguarding ourselves… that would be a great start.

                    Filthie:  I wholeheartedly agree – every dissident ought to be making contingency plans and putting aside what assets he can.  Not relying on the government or corporate promises (social security, pensions, etc.) to be there 10-15 years down the road.  We’ve just arranged to get more from my husband’s dwindling 401k – because even after the feds take their cut in taxes, and then tax it a 2nd time because it gets counted as income and may push us into a higher bracket – at least we can use it for our own needs and not wait and worry about getting to it before the feds decide to seize it.I know the loss of your daughter must be a constant grief, and I’m glad you’ve resolved to use the money you had intended for her future to instead help ensure your own.  My husband and I joke all the time about how much extra cash we’d have if we didn’t send so much to our sons – but for all their all-too- human flaws, they have generally retained our teachings and their future is our primary concern.As far as things not being able to endlessly continue as they are . . . all rational thought tells me that is so, and yet the plates continue to be juggled, the cans continue to be kicked down the road, and the bad continues to become worse.  As I have said, I don’t find many reasons to trust the average person, much as I’d like to.  At the same time, I definitely do not have faith in some sort of bright future (within my lifetime at least).If your hopes and predictions of some sort of confrontation do occur, I will humbly beg your pardon and do whatever I can to help.  But at present, I regretfully find your prognosis extremely optimistic.  I genuinely hope I am wrong, but will not plan based on that hope.

            Filthie: “We have to dismantle the systems that fail and build new ones.”The problem isn’t the systems.The problem is the psychological &amp; sociological makeup of the human beings [aka the reptiles in human skin suits] which man the systems.Furthermore, the psychology &amp; the sociology emanates from the literal ackshual DNA of the reptiles in human skin suits.Little boys are not having their penises lopped off [&amp; little girls are not having radical mastectomies] because of any particular system; they’re being butchered because the butchers have EVIL DNA, and the butchers experience literal licentious lascivious bliss at the thought of butchering the innocent.This war, like all wars, is inevitably about which genetic phenotypes will emerge supreme.None of this satanic insanity can be understood without acknowledging that:1) DNA determines behavior.2) These phenomena are entirely Darwinian in nature.3) Allowing EVIL DNA to persist &amp; metastasize throughout suhciety will drive Our Race straight into extinction.===============Then there’s the entire question of WTF do we do with the Psychological Eloi whom we call “Normies”, who are so d@mned mesmerizable &amp; hypnotizable that they’ve surrendered both their entire personal psychological makeups and their broader sense of sociological partisanships to the almighty power of Talmudvision &amp; Scr0tial Media.===============I suppose a cynic would point out that the Eloi are all fully v@xxinated, so within a few decades, we won’t even have the Eloi to worry about anymoar.Sheesh.

                “The problem is the psychological &amp; sociological makeup of the human beings [aka the reptiles in human skin suits] which man the systems…”
Agreed. In fact I agree with everything you say. Our laws and systems are the best ever invented in the history of mankind.
We have a people problem and that is going to have to be dealt with at some point whether we win or lose the preliminary skirmishes. The current order will fall… we might want to have a say in whatever replaces it.

            I agree with the general gist of what you are saying, except for this:
“The power players on our side are guys like Trump and Elon Musk…and our side throws more trash at them and boos and hisses at them louder than Lefty. ”
Both are more of the same centrist liberals. At best they are bailing wire and duct tape to the liberal project.

                Agreed TT… but they are a step forward, no matter how small.  The alternatives from the other side will only generate more misery and loss for everyone and are quantifiable steps backward.
Recovery will not be swift… it will be a long and very painful slow process even if things go kinetic.

            By 1963 the “Greatest Generation” was middle-aged and firmly established in leadership positions throughout American Society. They watched the Deep State murder JFK in broad daylight and did absolutely nothing about it. So yes the chance of anything changing without complete collapse is extremely remote.

        My view is that we have the Uniparty (Dems and non-Trump Pubs) and the MAGA party to throw a fit and dissolve after the election, leaving our one-party system to rule supreme.
Doug Casey has an interesting post on “The Forever War” on Lew Rockwell today: Islam slowly taking over Europe and then, possibly, the U.S. If you assume that the BRI and the BRIICS will be the new hegemon, even the Islamicized uniparty will end up being answerable to the incoming powers that be.

            Being a daily consumer of dissident media, I have been observing a seemingly sudden anti-Islam, and either explicitly or implicitly pro Israel sentiment, showing up in dissident media here in the last week or 2. Casey’s piece seems like part of it. Not to say that he’s wrong about the broad strokes. It’s the timing that I find interesting.

        So what happens, if or when, the Deep State steals another election in November? Will this be the last straw?Once again to my bellwether indicator of normie psychosis, Dan Bongino. Dan is long on America as long as Trump wins (vote harder my homies); but if not, Dan is going to get pissed this time; which means every other word out of his mouth will be swearing and cursing. This is his solution to what ails us.Can you imagine storming the beach at Normandy with men of this ilk? Is this the best that our species can now produce; vocal tantrums and more vote harder? This is why we continue to lose to pissant bureaucrats and corrupt politicians who’ve never held a real job in their life. We voluntarily disarm and pitch a fit in lieu of tangible effort.If all you can bring to the fight is bluster, you deserve to lose.

The only thing that will happen is “fed posting” and conservatives accusing each other of being feds.

                I disagree. There will be some action related to soft secession, but that will be allowed mostly as a means of venting. And you can bet that a lot of ad hoc militia movements will arise; again, mostly just as an angry show of resistance, but a few may stir up some limited action. The latter will largely be instigated and managed by Stasi agents much as they did with the Jan 6th protests and Michigan governor kidnapping plot.Nothing of real significance can, or will, occur until the collapse is in full swing. That’s when rioting becomes a thing and the jackboots come out to play.

And for those who want a resurgence of our Austrian Chancellor, one need only look at the new NATO Headquarters building. The obvious symbiology is hidden in plain sight, not once, but twice.

        Even if the Conservative party was ‘destroyed’, whatever came next, in my personal opinion, would still kowtow to the standard party lines. Even if say, a rejuvenated British National Party (BNP) replaced the Conservatives, wouldn’t they still sit on top of a bureaucracy staffed by Leftists and ‘Centrists’?I’m assuming in this case that ‘destruction’ of a party means that it has no seats whatsoever in government, and that it never will again. That’s all well and good, but in a world where large corporations are an extensions of government and where HMRC, the Police, the Armed Forces all have Leftist infiltration, I cannot see any actual party I’d personally want to vote for ever being permitted to form/get seats/ win much influence.Of course things can get worse, but the world is in a fallen state, so there’s that. Anybody who has read history understands that the deal for the plebs has been pretty measly for most of time. So it could get very bad indeed. However, seeing that a political party is not the be-all-and-end-all, I don’t think we’d bethatmuch worse off. And there are some who want to hasten the decline.I think that, regardless, we’re in for the slow decline even in the event the Tories get ‘displaced’. Seems more than likely that another placeholder party will just spring up. It would really take a master politician, a king of rhetoric and a cunning character to spin-up a proper nationalist party here and make it a force to be reckoned with… but that guy could be another Austrian Painter…

I’m not even sure what thelegalstanding of the UK is with respect to the EU anymore.In any case, I’d say that at least 80% of our MPs were pro-EU; plus the bureaucracy I mentioned above.The issue is that, even if a controlled-opposition figure like Farage does appear, we’ll still be in the same boat! Same uncontrolled immigration; same lack of discussion of the dysfunction of non-white peoples in Western nations; same kowtowing to international interests; same amount (give or take) of Leftistsat every station in the governmental system; same Godless populace.Of course, I could be wrong. Massively so.

                    I definitely don’t think Farage was/is controlled opposition. He was a massive upset to the system. However, he hasn’t pressed his advantage since 2016: just rested on his laurels as if the referendum was the “end of history”, when in reality the hard work was just beginning.

                        Farage looked like ‘selected opposition’ to me.  He had no ability to plan and no ability to organize, but he is amusing.  The perfect figurehead for the BBC to shine their light of publicity on.  The genius of establishment media is they get to pick their own opponents.

        I’d be surprised if the Tories died. They’ll get “surprising support” from “interesting quarters” and “do better than expected” and since expectations are so poor, then anything better than elimination is “a vote of confidence” and thus our cucky cousins across the Pond are stuck with their awful democracy until the Monarchy is toppled by the new Sultanate sometime wound the year 2040.

        Hitler was only possible in Germany because the democratic framework was so young and so weak. The U.S., emboldened by its long history of successful elections, marks the oldest functioning democracy in the world. Democracy is IN THE BLOOD.
In his zeal to eliminate democracy, Zman makes the fundamental mistake of positing equal conditions. But if Nazi Germany was a pillow full of feathers, modern America is an anvil made of iron.

            Democracy is in the blood of Anglo-Americans, who are a tiny part of the population today. Even the Germans (a huge portion of American whites) didn’t take to democracy until it was forced on them.
As to non-whites – the soon to be majority of this country’s population – democracy never was and never will be in their blood.
The US is already a country where the vast majority of people don’t have democracy in the blood. Take your Daily Wire propaganda elsewhere.

                I still say the U.S. will absorb its newcomers and make them into Americans. I realize this is an unpopular position to take here on the Z Channel — there seems to be an unspoken orthodoxy here on a number of issues: Putin is good, the American “Empire” is in its death throes, et cetera. I disagree on almost all these counts.Let’s address them one by one.Putin is an ex-KGB agent. There was nothing good about the KGB, and the motivation to join such an organization is always suspect, based partly on a lust for power. Now, I have nothing against lust for power — I too lust for power — but there is something tinpot-dictatorish about Putin which is just too glaring to ignore.I also disagree that America is in fundamental, terminal decline. If anything, its journey has just gotten started. There are 300+ million Americans, soon to be 4, and they form a mighty force on world affairs. It is a grievous mistake to underestimate this lot. Back when there were 125 million of them at the time of Big Two, they took on two world powers — Germany and Japan — and handily beat them. Any such contest now would result in an even more crushing defeat for the enemy.I think there is a subset to the Z Column community which specializes in upvotes and downvotes. I think the Silent Majority agrees with me more than my upvotes count indicates. In the past, I have gotten 14 upvotes and 0 downvotes, and while this is a nice feeling, one shouldn’t let one’s feelings dictate one’s positions. I stand by what I say about Hitler and Germany: the Weimer Republic couldn’t last, it was a poorly made parliamentary system, and the U.S. has a superb civil and institutional body backing it. There’s really no comparison.— Xloveli (dark.sport.blog)

                    I would take a unified, determined country of 125 million people, of whom 95%+ are of European descent, with a massive industrial base, over a multicultural shithole of 400 million people running on a paper economy.Look at what is going on the Red Sea. The USA, the global naval superpower, the protector of the world’s trade routes, is begging a bunch of guys living in tents to stop firing missiles at trade ships. The USA lost a proxy war in Syria and is losing a proxy war in Ukraine, and yet is still beating its chest. This is an incoherent empire that is surrounded by peoples who are starting to realize its more bark than bite.

        Gottfried adds a comment on his column this morning:“Allow me to note that there is a critical difference between dealing with a do-nothing opposition to the Left and a woke totalitarian regime, which will immediately criminalize “hate speech” and go after opponents as criminals. Even a divided Left will try to crush any significant opposition and enjoy the assistance of the ideologically driven media in its efforts to monopolize power. It is ridiculous to pretend that what the current Left wants is to be able to “rotate” in office and then return rule to the loyal opposition. It wants a one-party state and will do whatever is necessary to achieve that end.”This is a compelling counter point. I vote far less than I used to, but still do in situations where I think the person could prevent the left from making life worse for my family.  Thinking a collapse in support for the token opposition will bring about reform is just as much a fantasy land view as blindly supporting the faux opposition.  The party won’t collapse unless their financial backers pull funding.  There is no evidence they want to do this.

            They already do all off the stuff Gottfried is warning about. They already arrest people for “hate speech” — they just arrested a bunch of EIGHTH-GRADERS for “hateful” online chat, for fuck’s sake:
https://abcnews.go.com/US/eighth-graders-charged-racist-group-chat-southwick-massachusetts/story?id=108123039#:~:text=Six%20Massachusetts%20eighth%20graders%20face,early%20morning%20hours%20of%20Feb.
They already have a de facto one-party state, nothing really changes whether you have a “D” or an “R” in office, you still get the same wars for Israel, the “civil rights” bureaucracy, and the MIC.

                I don’t vote for Congress, but no one is going to convince me having Democrats in control of state and local government is only marginally worse or makes no difference for my family.  Even on the national level, as long as global finance is behind it all, the collapse of the Tories or the Republicans here just means another placeholder would spring up to take their place and we would keep going through the same charade just with the rachet moving to the left.

                It’s a question of scale. Sure they are already arresting people for wrongthink, but they aren’t (yet) arresting millions of people for wrongthink.

                There is no question that the alleged behavior in this case of these six juveniles is vile, cruel and contemptible,” Gulluni said. “Seeing it, and facing the reality that these thoughts, that this ugliness can exist within middle school students here in this community in 2024 is discouraging, unsettling and deeply frustrating.”

            The argument of “buying time” has some merit.  Thingsarebreaking our direction, although slowly.  For instance ten years ago I couldn’t imagine Israel being this unpopular, or people openly using the word “regime”.  How much of a benefit that is, and how much time we need versus how much we’ll get I don’t know.

                The “buying time” strategy is opposed by the ongoing demographic smothering of whites.  We may bide our time until our numbers are too few.
I don’t know the answer, I just see the dilema:
To charge the machine gun turrets or wait to be crushed in our trenches by their tanks?

        The context seems to be getting another Hitler would be a bad thing in itself, when in reality the only bad thing about it is that the country known as God’s Chosen Litterbox would kvetch the entire globalist cabal into uniting against him and his country, using the same old financial terrorism and spun tales of 6 trillion nuggets of clay being sifted away in homicidal pooper scoopers.

            Even back in my normiecon days, they never convinced me about Pinochet. Perhaps I was just a budding dissident and didn’t know it. Looking back, it seems I did have some vague unarticulated feeling that Hitler and Germans weren’t really my enemy.

Even if Hitler was being baited by Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt, he was stupid enough to take the bait and send the German people – his people – into the meat grinder.  A real idiot a-hole.  Bismarck shit better men than Adolph Schickelgruber.

        Britain is in a death spiral probably much acute than the USA. The political parties can’t do anything about; in fact they can’t (or don’t, same thing) even acknowledge it. So theatre is all that’s left. But going back further, Labour and Tories have been dance partners for as long as I can remember. Back in 1950, when the Tories won the general election, they kept the new welfare state in place for the next thirteen years. In 1987 when Labour came back, the first person Blair went to see was Thatcher. Blair was a continuation of Thatcher, her bastard son so to speak. The two parties move in tandem because of the electorate. If the electorate moves right — as it did in the last ’70s — then the parties have to adjust. After 1979, Labour lost three general elections (1983, 1987, and just barely 1992) because they refused to move to the right. Blair was Thatcher with a glib fork-tongued pitch. In some sense analogous to Clinton being a retread of Reagan with his “Third Way.”But I digress. Britain is in a death spiral and there’s no political solution to its travails. One of my favorite blogs in this regard is this one here:https://consciousnessofsheep.co.uk/2024/04/10/the-ill-starred-quest-for-a-new-electorate/

                Yes, I’m afraid there is a difference. Not so much maybe, but it’s there. Probably because of the nature of the parliamentary system and that the ruling party both makes the laws and is the executive.
On the minus side, Britain is a thrall of the USA and has been since 1945 and even more so after 1979. A thrall both geopolitically and (maybe to a lesser extent) culturally.

                        Thatcher came into office. Her stance was (unofficially) obsequiousness to the USA (hiding behind the euphemism of “our special relationship with the USA, which had the Americans wetting themselves silly), while officially trying to sound more macho and aggressive on the world stage. But the only way Britain could be more macho on the world stage was by being USA’s attack dog, or to put it more politely, its aide-de-camp. Britain became a very junior partner to the US imperium versus its previous semi-vassal status. This humiliating junior status was in evidence both in 1990 and in 2003. In contrast, during the 1960s, Britain refused to get involved in the Vietnam war.For the USA the advantage of this unequal relationship is that it has two votes in the UN security council and secondly that it can camouflage its lunatic military and foreign policy decisions and actions as those of the “international community” (i.e., USA and Britain, with Germany and France either silent or following half-heartedly). Oh, and lest I forget, Britain was USA’s Trojan Horse in the EU in the old days (now no longer needed as Germany and France are both full-fledged vassals themselves these days and the idea of a “social Europe” has irretrievably bitten the dust).

                        Election of Thatcher. It really was a huge game-changer for the UK. Whatever her flaws, millions of Brits became wealthy thanks to her policies. She raised living standards and brought back national confidence.

                Control of the media is everything.  Most people are not independent thinkers and the media dictates most people’s morality, whether Christian or trannie.
Everything follows from the media’s morality.  It is the lynchpin.

        I work for a German company, and a few weeks ago our communications commissar posed an hysterical screed telling the whole company that Mustache Man was returning due to AfD rising, German democracy was in crisis, and everyone had to band together to fight racism. She then made action items for people who live in Germany and don’t live in Germany to do in order to give support.First off, using a company blog to post this was insane, but even more insane was asking foreigners to essentially intrude on another nation’s political system. She did it without batting an eye. Luckily, the most popular comment was “um, can we just write software?”. Still, some virtue signaling ninnies showed their anti-racist bonafides, and even the CEO posted how our company is “against racism, zenophobia, blah, blah, blah”. It was imported American shitlib talk all the way down. I was half tempted to post that given their issues, they should give this Hitler chap a second chance.All of Europe is having this crisis, where either organized resistance from outside the ruling class is gaining support, or they jump want to burn it all down like Britain. Whatever the system in the West is in 20 years, it will not be a democracy, regardless of if they call it that.

                    Yup, both the Roman and English styles of salute are to symbolically indicate an unarmed hand. The American style of displaying the backside of the hand eschews this notion entirely. And this is one reason I don’t consider myself “European”; I don’t care if you know I am armed. In fact, it’s better all around if we both assume each other is packing.

                You’d think that if there were some actual German nazis out there they’d use the NSDAP-specific salute that everyone seems to have forgotten, not the universal “Roman” one from TV.
Not only does no living person remember what the nazis were really like, nobody even looks at film of them anymore. The gods of our creation myth have become imaginary.

            We should start a Nick Fuentes was right jar to put a penny every time people start praising Mustache Austrian Painter.I started checking Nick on Rumble and he is sort of the sperg guy that we don’t see as persuasive to the sensitive cat ladies or normies, but he is fun, the man has a comedian style including lashing out at his own followers. Even the Red Scare Pod girls bring him as a topic occasionally, chicks like funny cocky guys.Now that he is post-cancelled he keeps praising Mustache boy on Rumble as a defiance act to our real masters. Soon X will be full of Fuentes’ army of spergs and others replying to those “keep the horrible status quo or Hitler” with “I am already sold, you don’t need to sell it to me more” memes. Seriously, at this point I’ll take Hitler and a side of fries to go.

                Fuentes is walking talking meme at this point. The general rule of any internet discussion since BBS’s has been when the discussion runs out of fuel it inevitably dissolves to Adolf, there’s nothing substantial left to say. Fuentes had his heyday and is finished. He’ll buzz around and make some noise but that’s it.

            Politicians are populists when they don’t have enough support from the oligarchs. They can be very successful with that strategy. The failure happens once they win and get fully embedded into the system or if they are too weak and cowardly to destroy it.

                    Milei has a team that is steadily working with the chain saw. One of the worst of the labor “leaders” has backed down on a threatened strike, many changes in motion. While things here (Argentina) are economically stressful at present, a surprising number of folks are willing to give Miley &amp; Co. the benefit of the doubt at present. This bodes well for the nation, as far as I´m concerned.

                        The only reason why anybody is willing to suffer Milei is that Argentina is such a huge mess that people and some elites are willing to try anything. It will take years to see if things are really turning around.
Milei’s main risks/faults are his ideological zealotry which makes him do stupid things, like breaking ties with China (though he seems to be more realistic about that recently) and his extreme philo-semitism.
I wish Argentina good luck. It’s one of my favorite countries and the people deserve better.
