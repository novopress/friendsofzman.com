        The boomer nonsense my parents and teachers preached to me made school very difficult when I was young. I was taught to be ‚Äúcolorblind,‚Äù but all the the black and Latino kids saw nothing but color. I was taught that ‚Äúviolence gets you nowhere‚Äù yet the playground and the classroom  were run by the toughest thug in the class. I was taught that hard work and following the rules got you ahead in life. Yet, little Jamal‚Äôs coke dealing father dropped him off in a new Cadillac. Jamal was ‚Äúpoor,‚Äù he got free lunch and food stamps, but he wore $200 sneakers to school. I was taught that women were my ‚Äúequals‚Äù and were sexually attracted to a thoughtful, sensitive man. Wow, were my first few encounters with women awkward. I brought a vagina to a penis fight.Hard not to be cynical and angry at a group of people who threw me to the wolves with a head full of lies and nonsense.

            That describes my high school experience to a T.  Graduated in 1995 from a 95% black ‚Äúschool‚Äù.  Learned more about MLK and Booker T. Than the founding fathers.  Became a shitlord before I knew the term, writing papers on Rober E. Lee and Germany whenever possible.

        The retirement of the boomer generation will be the trigger that finally reveals the insanity of politicians buying votes with money borrowed from the future in order to fund bribes in the present. There is literally no way to keep the gravy train running when the cash outflow is predicated on one worker funding one retiree. This collapse is needed desperately, because voting behavior cannot change until the proverbial 2√ó4 hits these younguns upside the head. It also explains why they have accumulated so much debt. Their strategy is to scam the scammers. And they ain‚Äôt paying back shit.

                Not even remotely true. Cities and states across America are about to go bankrupt because they‚Äôve promised public employees ever-greater pension payouts over the last few decades and don‚Äôt have the money to pay for them. And that‚Äôs before you even consider the impossibility of paying for the Boomer‚Äôs healthcare bills.
The boomers have spent decades voting themselves more and more FREE STUFF, and are about to discover that the cupboard is bare.

                        You can‚Äôt vote yourself real assets when they don‚Äôt exist. People who generate real wealth are working on-the-books as little as possible while doing clandestine jobs at double time. It is possible to live as a single man for a few thousand bucks a year (without public assistance and the privacy loss that brings) if you are careful and lack expensive habits.

                    They are going to go bankrupt and leave the younger people (not retired yet), the taxpayers, and the investors in those communities holding the bag.  The retirees with their benefits in place are always the last to get a haircut. Examine the order of seniority in any insurance company workouts.  Existing annuitants are always taken care of, to the detriment of all other interested parties.  It‚Äôs the structure of things.

                It‚Äôs a Ponzi scheme, not an investment program. SSI and SSD have no limits based on pay-in. I predict that Congress will transfer and print funds to keep all .gov ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù coming even as the Dollar is devaluing against an official narrative of low-1-digit inflation after fraud adjustments (even while M1 fiat Dollar is doubling every 7 years). Ron Paul guarantees that everyone will ‚Äúgit they check‚Äù, but not the actual buying power of that check.
Power corrupts. Congress has the power of the purse. Congress is corrupt.

        I am a Boomer by dint of being born in the fifties. However, I have no illusions or delusions about this group, anymore than I believe in the Greatest Generation nonsense. There are too many people in all arbitrary generational classifications that do not think for themselves. Oh, they think for themselves in situations that deal with ‚ÄúHow does this benefit or harm me?‚Äù But, the Greatest Generation, or Dumbest Generation as I prefer, was programmed to mindlessly accept Federal Government supremacy in a conservative way. The Boomers were programmed to mindlessly accept Federal Government supremacy in a liberal way. There are people in all generations that are thinking people, but they are the exception in the herd.I began to free myself from Boomer propaganda early on. I wanted to believe in the equality of mankind, but the reality of blacks and women dissuaded me of that notion rather quickly. It is obvious that there is no equality, either within a biological group of people, or across biological groups. When you notice that the government and media are supporting the same agendas, you realize that the fix is in and coincidence has nothing to do with the reality you see. I know several boomers that are red pilled. I know several boomers that still parrot the BS they learned in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. There is nothing new under the Sun.

            Ask yourself, how many of ‚ÄúThe Greatest Generation‚Äù came through Ellis Island?  How many were the children of Ellis Islanders?Then ask how millions of illiterate peasants raised to submit to imperial rule can magically transform to Free Born Men with the Rights of Englishmen in a few short years.Then ask if FDR was only too happy to be their Sugar Emperor and we‚Äôve paid the price every since.I am a Yankee Doodle Dandy and my peeps invented this place and died for it, be they Patriot or Loyalist.

            There are too many people in all arbitrary generational classifications that do not think for themselves. Oh, they think for themselves in situations that deal with ‚ÄúHow does this benefit or harm me?‚ÄùI am old enough to remember voting based on my evaluation of how some action benefited or harmed the country.But that was a long time ago. Now I vote like everybody else. I choose the candidate most like me, the white man. If there are two on offer I pick the one who seems most disposed to take care of me and my interests, like everybody else.

        I‚Äôm 54 this year, born in 1963, of Depression era ‚ÄúSilents‚Äô.  Despite being raised in California, I was the product of farmers, not Hippies. I‚Äôve never been comfortable with the Generational Tags, as they never fit me well.I‚Äôm technically a ‚ÄúLate Baby Boomer‚Äù but after 4 years in the USAF in the 80‚Äôs and a growing dissent with what is now called ‚ÄúConservative Inc‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúthe GOPe‚Äù I‚Äôm now more Alt-Right than anything else.  I see in my son, the growing disdain for the older generations. He reveres his 80 yr old Grandfather, tolerates me, and hates 30-40 somethings. At 21, he is just discovering how the real world works. As his generation gains power, there will be many like him. It will make for a historic time.

            I have also seen some people categorize us as early Gen-X. I agree that we don‚Äôt fall into either category or any other category so easily. If there was anything defining about our generation, I believe it was the ascent of Ronald Reagan and Reaganism in the 1980s. But that has kind of faded at this point.

                Don‚Äôt confuse marketing labels/Madison Avenue shorthand for generational typing.  Boomers are the r-Selected offspring of WWII rabbits, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never want for anything like I did!‚Äù
GenX are the last Americans raised with first-hand knowledge of the original culture, pure WASP, without apology.  They pulled the rug out from under us in college.
So remember, if you don‚Äôt think like a Boomer, you aren‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs a market segment, shorthand for selling people stuff. Nothing more.
Me?  I self-identify as America, a Real Live Nephew of My Uncle Sam and I‚Äôve got the SAR/UEL to prove it.

            Yeah, I would never think of you as a Boomer. By the time you were noticing the world, it was the late 70‚Äôs. You probably voted for Reagan in ‚Äô84 and would have voted for him in in ‚Äô80 if you were old enough.
I think generational tags only work when you break free from decade labels. The Boomers came of age in the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs. Some unnamed group, the Dazed and Confused Generation?, came of age in the mid-70‚Äôs into the early 80‚Äôs. Gen X runs from mid-80‚Äôs though mid-90‚Äôs. Millennials and Gen Z follow.

                    My brother was quite a bit older than me. He went to his senior prom in a lime green tuxedo. The males had long hair and looked like extras from Saturday Night Fever. I went to my prom in a black tuxedo. The males had short hair and looked liked they stepped out of a Fitzgerald novel. The 70‚Äôs were a different time than the 80‚Äôs, but they were not the 60‚Äôs either.
From what I gather, the Korean War generation had a similar vibe. No one ever talks about them as a group with a defining culture.

                        What you‚Äôre trying to call the ‚ÄúKorean War generation‚Äù isn‚Äôt.  That war, from June 1950 to June 1953, was short, and also involved a smaller portion of population ‚Äì much like Viet Nam. Many of those who fought in Korea, particularly the early phase, were WW II vets, still in service or recalled. And those who arrived for the late period, overlapped, and often showed up as professionals and senior NCOs during the early stages of Viet Nam. Korean War was a link and transition. And the social changes during that short period were minor.

                        Actually, from my viewpoint, the 60s really continued ‚Äôtil about 1973. Then it went from the Hippie boomer stage to the Disco boomer stage (more my loss as I loathed Disco and loved the earlier music).
We identified to a certain extent with the earlier generation and were certainly boomers ‚Äì life was still good in America, TV was still the big three (no cable yet) and only our clothes and the higher acceptance of longer hair (men) marked us as being different than our older siblings.
The 70s teens were a bit less intense than our older boomer siblings.

Another one who remembers it wasn‚Äôt all sunshine for boomers. I graduated 2 years ahead of you and housing and jobs were brutal for several years. Early boomers were luckier in that regard. We‚Äôll get hosed come retirement too, I bet.
Of course the kiddies have it worse today, which sucks, but it‚Äôs a myth that the boomers screwed up everything. We had no damned say in anything. My first election was voting against that jackass Carter.

                        No say? Of course you did.Pat Buchanan got 21% of the vote in 1996 Republican Primary.Ross Perot got 18.9% of the vote (my 1st vote went to him).I‚Äôm sure there were a bunch of earlier choices your gen could have made.
Your generation just couldn‚Äôt tear itself away from voting for the traitors who promised you whatever you wanted, then you always forgave them when they didn‚Äôt deliver even as they laughed at you.
And if you truly didn‚Äôt have a choice due to corruption, you should have revolted then so your kids wouldn‚Äôt have to.

                            Born in ‚Äô57; graduated HS in 75.  As I recall, ‚Äô57 was the high tide of boomer births ‚Äî much of the WWII generation who were our parents were, by this point, getting some career and financial traction, and life was becoming more materially secure.As was mentioned above, I think it was the ‚Äúmy kids will not have to go through what I did‚Äù attitude that allowed unlocking the gatehouses guarding our culture, and granted free entry to all the endemic demons slithering about in the shadows of western civilization.I often hear about ‚ÄúThe Greatest Generation,‚Äù given what I do, and certainly believe they did tremendous things when called upon in WWII.  And those generations did carry on into the 1950s ‚Äî building the interstate highway system, fielding the Saturn V rocket and putting men on the moon.  But, they failed in what was perhaps their most important challenge ‚Äî protecting our culture, and passing their values on to their kids.  In some fashion, they were damaged, and they allowed, or encouraged, the rot that consumed the children of the 60s.I don‚Äôt think the many of them were ill-intended ‚Ä¶ I just think they were themselves ill-prepared to counter the power of the (LEFTIST) forces arrayed against them, and that now was slipping through the cracks in the wall protecting our civilization.  Many of those I talk to new just seemed confused about what happened, and unsure to this day just what the threat was, and where it came from.  They just wanted to go to college, start a business, raise their kids and forget about that four-year plus gap in their lives.The Greatest Generation tag, I‚Äôm afraid, is best affixed to some cohort preceding them by some decades.As to the accusation above that we main-body boomers bought into the growing cultural and political BS ‚Ä¶. many of us did.  Some, like me, were fooled for a while, at least superficially, though we  never let go of that older mythology belief structure. Yep ‚Ä¶ I had the biggest ‚Äúafro‚Äù hairdo in my school (largely white folk) in early 1974.  It was a way to fit in.  The Age of Aquarius BS was new, and powerful.  But I soon cut it off, never let go of my distain for the hippie types or youth movement, and joined the Navy in my late teens.  Many of us rejected the new morality and the marketing supporting it, but, we had little to rally around, as the protective structures surrounding our beliefs and institutions seemed to crumble with every feeble assault ‚Äî universities, the arts, et al.Looking at it at the time, I had the sense that those running the institutions, as well as our beliefs, and our willingness to defend them with our lives, just lessened, as if our once-proud and vital culture had just lost its will to live.

                            Voted Republican (except in ‚Äô80 when I gave Anderson his money ‚Äôcause I couldn‚Äôt stomach the other two).Never bought into the something for nothing mindset and neither did many of my cohorts.We‚Äôre not really a cohesive group; we run the gamut from conservative to batshit left crazy. I‚Äôm moderate leaning right.Being a teen of Watergate, I have never, ever trusted *any* politician. Every single one ‚Äì left or right, will screw you. If you believe otherwise ‚Äì you‚Äôre insane and/or stupid. This means our vote doesn‚Äôt really matter, but we go through the motions because ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know. We just do. It doesn‚Äôt matter. All that matters is that the rich and powerful stay that way and hopefully we don‚Äôt get screwed too badly. It has *always* been that way and until we nuke ourselves into oblivion, it will always *be* that way.Revolting? Are you fucking daft? The 60s boomers did that and they gained little. Remember Kent State? I may hate corruption but I‚Äôm not dying for it. Besides, unlike libtards, I was too busy working to survive, then raising kiddies, then working ‚Äì repeat. Marching is for the unemployed and lazy.Sign me late boomer cynic

                I think the problem is that birth control and cultural changes in the 20th century didn‚Äôt fit nicely with the ‚Äú25 year‚Äù generational gaps of old. Due to widespread contraception adoption in the 70‚Äôs likely cause a generation to split by almost 7-10 years into two separate generations, raised by the same parent generation, but came up during different cultural periods, and that split carries on.

                    It wasn‚Äôt a generational gap. It was a marketing strategy. Lump all the young people into one ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù and sell stuff to them. The idea that folks born in the late 40s are like folks bornin 1964 is silly.

            I‚Äôm a couple years older than you, Thomas, and have never considered myself a boomer.  To me, boomers were those who benefited from the post-war optimism ‚Äî by the time I was a child, that optimism had turned to dust.  Of course, I was raised at ground zero, in California.  Things in CA were a bit more ‚Äúprogressed‚Äù than in the rest of the country, which perhaps explains why other people my age identify as boomers.I never saw the government as legitimate.  Still don‚Äôt.   I see it as an alien, immoral force that sucks the life and hope out of ordinary Americans and seeks to replace legacy Americans ‚Äî white Protestants ‚Äî with groups who hate us. I lament the loss of rugged individuals, the strong men and women who pressed west toward California.  Now, we‚Äôre all instances of a class, no more ‚Ä¶ often less.

                Born 1960, came of age late ‚Äô70s/early ‚Äô80s.  The real Baby Boomers were the ‚Äô60s hippies, IMO.  We got pastel tuxes and long hair at the prom, watched the people a few years ahead of us bomb out on coke and disco-y orgies in their 20s.  High school teachers partying with their students because, why not? Put up with MASH and all those Norman Lear spin offs that just tried to destroy everything.  Oil shortages, ongoing recessions, a dying Dollar, and Jimmeh Carter.  Not much good in there.  But all white and male dominated, all of it.  Reagan represented some sort of way out of all of the bad stuff, and he was, to a point.  By ‚Äô82, things were all different.The ‚Äô60s were about tearing everything down, in order to get laid.  The late ‚Äô70s was about getting laid in the ruins of it all.

Truer words were never spoken, LOL.
The older boomers were serious and agitating and trying to change the world; we just wanted to enjoy life. (And some of us were not into drugs at all.)

                    I think that‚Äôs right, but I‚Äôve noticed that people my age didn‚Äôt start thinking more like me until they got older. They seemed to be more taken in with the predominant modes of thought when they were younger. All the same, it may be by attrition. A ton of them are dead from alcohol and drugs.

                    I agree about the early vs late boomers.  I heard someone say that a good dividing line on that one was something like:  If you went through puberty before Sgt. Pepper came out you were an early boomer, if you went thru afterwards you were a late boomer.

            I was born in 1948. Drafted into Army 1968. Poor background. The 60‚Äôs foolishness also passed me by. I have worked since I was 15. Married late to younger woman. Two kids in their mid 20‚Äôs. Yes, it is interesting. Son still has 1 year of college left. Both kids worked during college. Dad/Grand Dad insisted. No college debt allowed for either. They always paid for part of their tuition. The media trust, for me, ended with Walter Cronkite. If Walter could sit there and lie to the country, no one could be trusted.

                I think it also helped being a child of old parents who were themselves the children of older parents (both of my grandpas were born before 1900) and having great-grandparents who were still around and lively (one was born a year after the Civil War).  Another was coming from a poor, rural family ‚Äî deathly afraid of banks, the revenuers, and starving/freezing to death‚Ä¶nobody will take care of you but yourselves, joining the military is your duty and not a bad life overall, be respectful and don‚Äôt be ignorant (not all poor grits and immigrants were unwell read).My husband‚Äôs family was much the same way: ol‚Äô Klaus was in his mid-60s when he moved over here and had my father-in-law, his wife in  her late 40s.  And he gave up everything to get over‚Ä¶largely due to political ideology fever swamps in his home country (doesn‚Äôt make for a person who cares much for political affiliations or ideals; cares more about just getting by).

        All stereotypes are true, so there‚Äôs certainly something to be said for generational theory.Of coursepeople who grow up in a particular cultural and political milieu, enjoying the same entertainment, and consuming the same products are going to have tons of common touchstones and shared experiences. Of course they will.I‚Äôm an early GenXer (1967) who grew up in a distant outpost of the Anglo diaspora, and I distinctly remember being repulsed from an early age by the self-indulgent decadence of Boomer culture: the declining hippie movement, the treacly, over-produced 70s pre-punk music on the radio, the sheer ugliness of the hair, the clothing, the whole built environment.My parents are Silents, and while I love them dearly, their generation shares much of the blame with the boomers for our current predicament. Perhaps the most fortunate generation ever to walk the earth, they missed all the wars, and came of age in a time of full employment, great pensions, and astonishing benefits, with a suburban house costing two years‚Äô worth of a single-income earner‚Äôs salary. (A similar house today is well north of ten years‚Äô salary, and in some formerly affordable places closer to 20.) With such immense security, they had the luxury of embarking on a crusade to fix society, and all the baneful problems that beset us today‚Äìno-fault divorce, open immigration, abortion on demand, subsidization of single motherhood and like destructive behavior, and a progressively dumbed-down educational system‚Äìcan be laid at their feet.The Greatest Generation gave birth to the Boomers, who in turn spawned the Millennials, who make up the ranks of the SJWs and Antifa thugs. The Silents sired Xers, and GenZ (or GenZyklon, as the joke goes on the alt-right) are our children.We Xers occupy a privileged position of sorts, as we‚Äôre the last generation to remember the West as it used to be, before the Silent/Boomer rot sunk to its foundations. We remember safe, peaceful, largely monocultural societies, we learned histories that weren‚Äôt yet wholly infected by self-hatred (though it was certainly there), our grandparents were a link to an earlier, more realistic time, and we spent most of our free time as children on untraceable adventures around our neighborhood, because there was nothing to do inside.But GenZ gives us reason to hope. My red-pilled 19 year-old son reports that his contemporaries are far more likely to give alt-right views a sympathetic hearing than their Millennial elders, and I suspect their discontent will only grow as they enter a workforce glutted with self-satisfied Boomers and social-justice crazed Millennials, and experience for themselves the near-impossibility of finding affordable housing in which to raise a family. The backlash, when it comes, will be fearsome.

            This. I‚Äôm astonished by 20-somethings today. They sound like me when I was their age, which is a bit disorienting. I expect them to be super-PC like the millennials, but the opposite is true. A quintessential Boomer with whom I do business complains all the time about the 20-somethings in his firm. His complaint is they will say any un-PC thing that comes to their mind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like they have no idea who‚Äôs listening.‚Äù This is a guy who is into our thing so he is not scandalized by any of it.

                Yeah, I know that‚Äôs how it comes across. Who‚Äôs to say that I wouldn‚Äôt have voted for societal destruction if I were born (say) 15 years earlier?But that‚Äôs really not my intention. We‚Äôre all individually accountable for the decisions we make, and none of us can choose the cultural milieu we grow up in, but the fact is that Silents and Boomersdidsupport, in large part, to eat (or burn) the seedcorn of future generations. They didn‚Äôt think they were doing any such thing, not most of them‚Äìthey simply thought they knew better than anyone who‚Äôd come before them.What really burns me about Boomers and Silents is that so few of them are willing to acknowledge the catastrophic failure of their youthful idealism. They sequester themselves in safe white communities, far from the chaos and fragmentation they unleashed on the younger generations, and continue to vote left, ‚Äúlike‚Äù Cultural Marxist bullshit on Facebook, and donate to organizations devoted to continuing the work they began in the 1960s.If I ever encountered a Boomer who said ‚ÄúYes, I supported these policies, and I now realize that they were disastrous failures, which I deeply regret,‚Äù no problem, we‚Äôre all good. But when so many of them remain, not just impenitent, butproudof what they accomplished, well, what am I to conclude? Only that they deserve whatever‚Äôs coming to them.

            I grew up in a white middle class outpost of suburban California.  Got my driver‚Äôs license in 1976.  No racial issues, Vietnam was over, alcohol, pot, and cocaine were all over the place.  There was only one thing that took a bunch of us down.  Car and motorcycle accidents.  Thinking back, in my typically sized high school, there were at least a dozen deaths and serious injuries from car accidents.  Mostly boys, but a few girls that got run into by the boys.  Rollovers and careening into trees and power poles, mostly.  Every year the high school yearbook was dedicated to between one and three kids who had died in accidents during the year.The rest of it came later in our young lives, but the car accidents seemed to just be part of the landscape, some sort of fated thing.

        Andrew Anglin on Boomers:It is always a mistake to try and reason with or explain something to a boomer.

        I‚Äôm not quite sure what to make of this analysis. I just don‚Äôt see a large-scale pushback from the younger generation. Collectively, the Millennials are just too stupid to do anything other than obey.The Millennial generation voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and for Clinton in 2016. Both Obama and Clinton advocated big government programs which ultimately rely on wealth transfer from the young and productive to the old and unproductive. Proof: Millennials *still* overwhelmingly approve of Obamacare, even though it forces them to buy worthless health insurance at inflated prices in order to reduce the cost of coverage to the elderly and to subsidize Medicaid expansion.Democrats are now waving the trinket of student loan relief in front of the Millennials and they are responding with their votes. ‚ÄúHey kid, we‚Äôll restructure your $30k worth of student loans in exchange for a lifetime of servitude‚Äù is a winning political position with the Millennials. Morons.Japan‚Äôs national debt suggests that the US still has a long way to run with our debt binge. I am roughly the same age as you, Z-man, and I fully expect to draw Social Security until I die, financed by an ever-expanding national debt.

            Japan is a homogenous nation with strong social structures, a culture of saving, and minimal immigration.
America‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt. Nor is most of the West.
Which is why Japan will still be around long after most Western nations have collapsed. Though it may well be a province of China by that point.

Hey, we just wanted the blacks to stop burning down the cities and beating up white girls in school riots.
So we gave them food stamps because what were we supposed to do? Shoot them all?

The welfare only increased, and more white girls are getting raped and killed than ever before.
Boomers made every problem we had in society worse, and then invented new ones.
And now the only tool we have left to fix these problems is fire.

        There is truth to this. But the problems in education in particular as well as the society in general started prior to the boomers. The education system became left-wing and dumbed down in the 70‚Äôs, before the boomers had any influence in it. The rot of Keynesian economic theory (a criminal sophistry if there ever was one) was created even before the WWII‚Äôs came of age. Once of age, the WWII‚Äôs bought into Keynesian criminality with scarcely any fore thought at all. The Boomers created lots of problems. But they are not the only ones to blame for our current mess.

            A generation that is 90% white will be absolutely hated in the coming decades as whites slide into hated-plurality rather than hated-majority. Any of my fellow boomers who didn‚Äôt do their duty and produce several children and subsequent grandchildren has nobody to blame but themselves. The only social security policy that can be relied upon in times of societal struggle are flesh and blood with strong familial bonds.

        Today‚Äôs insolent youth are the same as yesterday‚Äôs insolent youth; uninformed and disdainful of that which came before.  Three million boomers served in Viet Nam with almost 60,000 thousand losing their lives.  That was a ‚Äògreatest generation‚Äô war fought under their rules for defeat with no intention of victory.We boomers gave them a victory in Viet Nam despite our leaders best efforts, and despite the ultimate rejection of the Viet Nam victory by the ‚Äògreatest generation‚Äô,  the ten years of battle in Viet Nam stopped the onslaught of communism into  Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong and all the other emerging power houses in the far east.It was a time that forever put paid to the smell of mimeograph machines in schools and offices as Xerox, manned by boomers, revolutionized schools, offices and industry.  It was the boomers who bought bags of parts that resulted in assembled computers after hours spent amidst flux and solder in their basements and garages.It was these same boomers who took these homebuilt computers into their offices and the factory floor that forever changed the face of not only America, but the entire world. Just as today‚Äôs generation would hate to be memorialized as the ‚ÄòKardashian generation‚Äô, the boomers resent the  characterization of their lives as those of hippies and love children.

            This is ironically typical boomer think. Nobody younger than my grandson gives one toot about all the blessed innovations we built. The long-run story for my grandkids and their offspring is being a hated minority in the land of their ancestors. The Silents actually opened the floodgates in ‚Äô65, but it was the Boomers who made a cause celebre about the whole ugly process of destroying white society in order to atone for our perceived historic sins.The vapid modern culture you‚Äôre complaining about isn‚Äôt an outgrowth of your spoiled white grandchild, it‚Äôs the outgrowth of a society that‚Äôs run by and for anyone except for your white grandchild‚Äôs good health and well-being. That‚Äôs why everyone in the alt-right at a young age hates us and calls us hippies. The flower power types are just a caricature of the thoughts that you‚Äôre expressing: Look at all the wonders we‚Äôve created man, why‚Äôs everyone mad?All those great wars, all those great innovations, and yet the one and only foundation and ultimate Thing That Matters, the continuation of our people, our culture, and our genetic legacy, doesn‚Äôt even cross your mind. The majority of the Z generation aren‚Äôt even white. Your cowardice helped make that possible. Own it. The sooner we as white Boomers accept that as a mistake and work to correct it without resources, the better.

                        To be fair, I‚Äôm sure the 50s weren‚Äôt as great as they were made out to be on TV. But a while ago I started watching an old British TV show from the 60s which was often set in and around the areas where I used to live over there. And it was like watching a documentary about a foreign country.
People were British, doing British things in British towns and villages. Had the generation before me not set out to turn those towns into Kabul-on-Thames, I‚Äôd probably still be living there.

There are things about that era that are appealing, but there is a reason people were willing to trade away those things for what came next. That means there was an undesirable aspect that is not obvious through the mists of time. I would have hated the 60‚Äôs. The 70‚Äôs, without the horribly ugly styles, would have been just right for me. I would have been a great city cop in the 70‚Äôs. Corrupt, but fair.

                                To be fair, I think a fair bit of the 50s nostalgia among the yoot is just countersignalling Boomers, who confected the myth of the 50s as a dreary, oppressive, wowserish age that deserved to be crushed under the boot heel of the hippie movement. (The wretched moviePleasantvilleis perhaps the apotheosis of this myth.) The young‚Äôuns are just engaged in the modern version of ‚Äúfreaking out the squares‚Äù.

                                I think the anti-50‚Äôs stuff from the boomers is likely misremembered propaganda or deliberate propaganda. The 50‚Äôs likely were not a bad era.
Now that said, the rot in the West already existed in the 50‚Äôs, and likely before that. I think the 1960‚Äôs was when the rot was strong enough to express itself in the open. For example, when my grandparents died, I found photos of them in the mid-1950‚Äôs when they were 18/19 years old. The photos were of them at the local YMCA, naked, in the forest area on the grounds.

                                I would have liked the 60s (early boomer vs the late one that I was), I think. The 70s was a bit on the dull side and the wheels were beginning to come off of the USA.
Gas shortages. high interest rates, lack of jobs  lack of morality, drugs, ‚Äì it‚Äôs not what it was cracked up to be. Even the music post ‚Äô75 blew. It took the ‚Äô80s ‚Äôtil music was good again.

                        I think you‚Äôre missing the point of the young‚Äôs nostalgia for the 50s. ‚ÄúThing were great,‚Äù isn‚Äôt what awes the socks off these young men. It‚Äôs looking out into a world full of whites that impresses them.I can‚Äôt speak to the TV effect as I haven‚Äôt watched TV in decades and didn‚Äôt have one at home in the 50s, but I would strongly argue that they‚Äôre correct in assessing that the nation is a far ‚Äúshittier,‚Äù place now that almost none of our pleasant white communities are without black and mestizo crime and our cities are uniformly overrun with such along with the new bonus content of Islamic terrorism.My grands and great-grands all lived well into the 80s. Life expectancy and quality of life hasn‚Äôt gone up remarkably in the last two generations for anyone but the most affluent. So it stands to reason that, despite the imminent wave of problems already cresting in the 50s, it was a veritable utopia of social stability compared to what Millenials have grown up with.

                            That‚Äôs a good point. I also see that the more radical youth grew up in the Northeast/Cuck Belt. Maybe it comes from growing up deep inside the Cult‚Äôs ancestral home. Maybe it is the result of massive migration the last 30 years.

                                It‚Äôs a feeback loop. Prog culture demands increasingly irrational shows of loyalty from the perceived majority because it has historically operated on the paradigm that the majority is largely fixed and it has to contend with the fact that its minority coalition is incredibly disparate.
Tensions rose exponentially when the transition from majority and minority to competing pluralities became readily apparent. Not because of the demographic shift alone but because approval of and submission to broadly anti-white politics became mandatory.

                        Old proverb
You can‚Äôt cross the same river twice
You can build something new though, with aspects of the old. Its going to require an extremely homogeneous society and for a few generations and pretty oppressive and brutal  one as well
Regulation of public behavior and the economy leaves Liberatrds and the Ayn Rand Jihad with a sour stomach but its necessary
Decide what the rules are going to be and make people comply till they become fairly ingrained
It will take a couple or three generation though and more will than anyone has right now

                re:  ‚ÄúWhat percentage of Boomers messed around with computers?‚Äù DutchYou travelled in a different country from me. When I went to High School starting in 1956 I had the opportunity to do in my spare time the following:1) Buy and put together many ‚Äúcomputers‚Äù using Oliver Garfield Company‚Äôs GENIAC computer kit which included Claud Shannon‚Äôs Master‚Äôs Thesis;2) Under the auspices of an Amateur Astronomer‚Äôs Association ground and polished a 6 inch pyrex blank to better than an 1/8 wave of sodium light then used it to make a Newtonian telescope including a German equatorial mounting; the mirror still exists on a shelf in my study.3) My Junior year during the second semester took in the evening Circuits one for college credit at the city science center; about 200 students started the course and fifteen of us finished; the course was free but one had to get permission from the High School administration to attend; the course was taught by a University Professor;4) Took Harvey White‚Äôs Continental Classroom Physics on tv at 6:30 a.m to 7:00 a.m. five day a week for two semesters 1958-1959 during my Senior year; the course was taught by the head of Berkeley‚Äôs Physics department along with a few guest lecturer‚Äôs of renowned stature.I was not alone as plenty of us were interested in ham radio, computers, and science in general. None of my friends were drinking or taking drugs in those years that I was aware. A high percentage of my classmates ended up with Ph.D.s, M.D.s, J.D.s and many became engineers.Dan Kurtp.s. In the late 1970s, I bought one of the first 50,000 Apple IIs that were made. I have been interested in computers for a long time as you can see. Yesterday I had some hands on with the just updated 27‚Ä≥ iMac at the local Apple store; I need an excuse to buy it. Now that I am retired my interests are primarily Astronomy, Computers and reading. Last night I began Barzun‚Äôs From Dawn to Decadence. So much to do.

                        @One RogueIt was an all Boys Catholic high school with IRON discipline. If you were charged with three infractions you were OUT and that rule of three was for all four years. I had only one infraction. The day after an ice storm hit the region during the night, no public transportation was running. To get to high school from my home was complicated. I had to take two street cars, or two busses, or a streetcar and a bus to get there and it generally took 50 minutes to an hour. I knew no one who had a car as there was no parking available and the high school was on the top of a hill, a really steep hill. (Mr. Gallagher, my first year Latin teacher, was called out of class one day as the parking brake apparently let go and his car rolled a fair distance down the hill before stopping. No great damage was done but it was quite the ruckus.)Being late for school was an infraction. Forces of nature were not excuses. My father actually drove me to the school and I got to the first class about 20 minutes late. When I entered the classroom the teacher asked me for my note from the vice principal‚Äôs office. I said that my father drove me once he found out that there was no public transportation and he had to return from his workplace to get me there. The teacher told me that I was late and I must turn myself in to the vice principal. Later that day I had an hour‚Äôs detention and one blow from a cane while holding my ankles. I remember that no more than 25% of students made it to school that day. I was one of two in my graduating class of circa 300 who had four years of perfect attendance. A handful of graduating students were given perfect conduct awards.Dan Kurt

While the hippy counterculture was going on in the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs, tens of thousands of other boomers were serving honorably in places like Vietnam.The exact same thing can be said of today‚Äôs youthful generation. While the snowflakes at places like Berkeley and Evergreen get all the press, there are tens of thousands of their youthful colleagues who are serving in the middle east and elsewhere.

        Sorry ZMan, I don‚Äôt buy a lot if what you are saying. As an early boomer i think it is safe to say I have encountered and know well a lot more boomers than you. While your description fits many boomers I do not think it describes the majority of us.  If I am reading you right you seem to be placing a lot of trust in today‚Äôs youth, you clearly believe that today‚Äôs young hate boomers. I don‚Äôt doubt that the young hate the boomers, but it is a hate driven by jealousy. The boomers are rich, they had opportunities which they exploited to acquire material wealth. Today‚Äôs young realize those opportunities are gone, they live in a society that has lost its confidence and sense of purpose. They realize that living with mom and dad is the most likely prospect for them until middle-age. Boomers could build things, fix things, work with their hands. The closest thing today‚Äôs kids can come to doing manual labor is banging away on their cell-phones and video game consoles with their thumbs. I recently attended a custom car and hot rod show. Everyone there was a boomer. Most of the cars were built or restored by their owners, people who could build things. Today‚Äôs youth could not even assemble a plastic car model from a kit.For the last ten years I was a teacher at a public high school in Northern California so I encountered lots of young people. Granted, that is hardly a random sample of millennials but from what I see in the media, their values are not that much different from other young people throughout the country. The temper tantrums being engaged in on college campuses is not limited to Berkeley.  From my experience I have absolutely no hope or expectation that they will be able to (or are even inclined to) alter the current, destructive course our society is taking. They embrace, without question, every new, progressive idea that comes their way, cis-gender, white privilege, BLM,  LGBT-whatever; ‚ÄúIslam is a religion of peace‚Äù, etc. ad nauseum.If you are placing your trust and hope in today‚Äôs youth I think you will be sorely disappointed.

            NAXALT is a terrible argument and should go without caveat in these circles. The young, in my estimation, don‚Äôt exist as we knew them. Our poor decisions as Boomers and those of our parents (Silents voted for the folks who put the 1965 immigration act into effect) obliterated them.So it‚Äôs no longer worth kvetching about ‚Äúthe youth,‚Äù in the same way that these young whites can complain about ‚Äúthe boomers.‚Äù The boomers are 90%+ white Americans with several generations history and tradition, just like their parents. ‚ÄúThe youth,‚Äù in the America of today are nearing a Mestizo plurality and the shrinking white youth cohort is now politically eclipsed by every other stripe in the liberal rainbow.Isolating the white youth, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre about as good of stock as we ever had. Trouble is, we left them to institutions that were obviously out to destroy them, fill their heads with madness, and let their non-white peers batter them into submission. And somehow by no fault of our own a whole bunch of them have founded the alt-right and got a serious reactionary movement going.It‚Äôs no small feat what the young white men of today have accomplished. Personally, I think it‚Äôs time to lend a hand rather than punch down. We earned the licks we‚Äôre getting. So far as I‚Äôm concerned, the right-wing youth can pillory us all day.

                The youth of each generation and sub-generation have always had big obstacles and hardships.  The obstacles just keep evolving.  A minority of each youthful group figure out how to take care of themselves.  The rest find their way, typically depending on either the kindness of strangers or their family‚Äôs past generations, or scheming to carve out their piece of the pie off of the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù, such as it is at any given time.  It has always been so.

            boomers learned to work on cars because that was the environment they were born into. today‚Äôs youth have a different set of circumstances and like every person born on this planet are adapting to them to survive, reproduce, and thrive. i think it‚Äôs the arrogance of boomers that turns off the youth to them, but that also could be a perpetual generational dynamic, I don‚Äôt know. The youth that are politically minded and dissatisfied certainly blame boomers for the conditions in which they find themselves fair or not. it would be nice if boomers  accepted society is in steadfast and accelerating decline at least that they could be seen as on the same mental wavelength rather than daydreaming that they are sitting on the lawn at a grateful dead concert with not a care in the universe.

                We worked on cars because they were old and weren‚Äôt going to fix themselves, and we couldn‚Äôt afford to pay others to do the work.  Cars were also the way to get out in the world, as there was no interactivity whatsoever in the media or entertainment, unlike today.  One drove out into the big wide world to find out what was going on and what to do next.  Now one does that on the web.

                    Try working on cars today.  Intentially over complicated with proprietary tools and no room to work.  You need to have $10000 tools to work on and diagnose cars now, not just a crescent wrench and elbow grease.  Even older gear heads are getting gamed out by some ‚Äúadvances.‚Äù.

            The boomers are rich, they had opportunities which they exploited to acquire material wealth. Today‚Äôs young realize those opportunities are gone, they live in a society that has lost its confidence and sense of purpose.Note how subtly the goalposts are moved here. The Boomers got wealthy through exploiting opportunities, but the younger generations today‚Ä¶well, those opportunities just mysteriously vanished somehow!  Nothing to see here, just one of those things that happens!It couldn‚Äôt possibly haveanythingto do with Silents and Boomers voting to open the immigration floodgates to allow in hordes of incompatible aliens, or supporting policies that laid waste to the traditional family, or advocating a sexual libertinism not seen since the heyday of Ancient Rome, or encouraging women to stay in the workforce throughout their most fertile years. Or, or, or.If what I write doesn‚Äôt describe you, then I‚Äôm not talking about you. But taken en masse, the Boomers need to own the consequences of their disastrous decisions.

                In addition to the Boomers‚Äô ‚Äòscorched earth‚Äô policy towards the US and their belief in some sort of IRL Star Trek-like ‚ÄúFederation of Planets‚Äù kumbayah globalism, they completely failed to raise their kids.  This is best explained by Dr. Leonard Sax in ‚ÄúThe Collapse of Parenting.‚Äù  They also divorced in record numbers.Subsequent generations hate the Boomers because they completely failed in their duties towards us.

                There are no more opportunities? Really? How odd then that I see many millennials and Gen X‚Äôers seizing opportunities right left and center and doing very well.

                    As I wrote elsewhere in the thread, my problem with the Boomers is that so few of themowntheir messes, preferring instead to mythologize them as a great step forward for humanity while they hunker down in their nice neighborhoods, insulated from the chaos they fomented.For my part, I‚Äôm a relatively successful professional with a well above average income. But my children can look forward to an adulthood spent as a despised class in an ethnically fragmented, bankrupt, lowest common denominator society, with virtually no opportunity to enjoy the kind of security and affordable family formation that the Boomers took for granted.

Average income has been falling since the 70s.  Purchasing power of the average wage has been falling since the 70s.  The middle class is shrinking, with much of the loss to the lower class.

            I‚Äôm inclined to agree with much of your comment.  The rot that really set in by the mid sixties was not brought by boomers, the oldest of whom would have been barely out of high school.  They weren‚Äôt old enough to effect that change (civil rights, Hart-Celler, etc, etc.)  Those who had the power to effect that damage were at least a generation older, and many in power were two generations older.  Boomers are as guilty of buying into the zeitgeist of their time as every subsequent generation has been, and in fact, each succeeding generation accepts ever more degeneracy and white-hating propaganda than Boomers did and do.As you say of kids today, ‚Äúthey embrace, without question, every new, progressive idea that comes their way, cis-gender, white privilege, BLM, LGBT-whatever; ‚ÄúIslam is a religion of peace‚Äù, etc. ad nauseum‚Äù as a greater percentage of their generation than Boomers did in my opinion, which frankly amazes me, since they grow up in the presence of a lot more diversity than I did, and usually, mere proximity to diversity is enough to wake you up to egalitarian lies.  I‚Äôm in agreement, subsequent generations are at least as pozzed as Boomers are.  In fact, more so, from what I can see.  Thankfully, in America, there is still the opportunity to express Alt-Right, pro-Western Civilization, and outrage at degeneracy without being thrown in jail for hate speech‚Ä¶ for now (although you can lose your job if doxxed.)  Before the internet, they could gaslight you by controlling the message in schools and the media, so I do have some hope that the younger generation is waking up, as long truth can be expressed on the internet.  The powers that be know that they cannot control peoples thoughts without complete control of the message, so within ten years, look for hate speech laws to control crime-think, especially on the internet.  If Trump hadn‚Äôt won, they‚Äôd be pushing for it already.Anyway, Boomers are no more guilty than subsequent generations, and the rot did not begin with them.

            My hatred of boomers just went up a notch.Did you ever step in and tell one of your fellow teachers they shouldn‚Äôt be teaching all that PC SJW nonsense? Or did you keep quiet like a cowardly bitch so you could go online and complain about what weaklings your charges are?My boomer dad had a 2yr degree, got a job in sales that supported a stay-at-home mom, stayed 30 yrs till he retired with good benefits.When  he retired, that job was eliminated, replaced with a system that consolidated w/ other positions so more work, but less pay and no benefits.  And never gives a raise as they expect that person to quit eventually so they can hire a new person fresh from college at whatever the minimum is they can get away with.This is representative of many of the changes in the economy over the decades.What use is knowing how to do something with our hands, when immigration has degraded the value of labor to where it is near minimum wage?  We have so many immigrants because boomers didn‚Äôt care then, and they don‚Äôt care now. As long as their 401(k) gets good returns. Even if America turns to shit, they can always move to Ecuador!The latest generation isn‚Äôt so much super lefty as it is super polarized. Many are the SJW PC losers that you mention, but many white youth are also going far right, often coming to the alt-right. They have been told they are shit, that they should be ashamed of who they are, of who their ancestors are. And many of the people telling them this are boomers like yourselves.

        When I was a teen in the 80‚Äôs, having to hear lectures about Gen X being deficient, always left me wondering what they called the kids who came along in the late 70‚Äôs? They were technically Boomers, but they were nothing like the people who came of age in the 60‚Äôs   Z-manThey called us Tweeners and we were literally not worthy of a generation, until somewhere in the mid-80s when Boomers pulled us in to add yet more political heft to the huge demographic rabbit being digested through the birth rate snake.We are nothing like the classic Boomers.  I was barely riding my own two-wheeler when Tet happened, have precious little memory of JFK or any other Icon of the Boomers.They grew up to free love and a sexual revolution, we grew up into a herpes and AIDS environment.They got Jimi and the Temptations the Beatles and Zep.  We got disco.(to be fair, the music was exceptional and I still appreciate it to this day, even as I curse not being able to get away from it even for a moment)I told my wife as we were still dating that we were brought on to be the cleanup crew behind the circus parade of Boomer culture and I see no reason to change that viewpoint.To make things worse, we‚Äôre at the ages that they continually talk of cutting loose regarding ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù so they now view us as thoroughly expendable again.I am the prototype for the classic Gen X-er.  The soul-patched slacker.(holds up galvanized garbage can lid as a shield)  You‚Äôre welcome.

We were rejected, constantly told what looser we were, but it wasn‚Äôt us that broke the world.  Boomers murdered the very ones who would have been there to support them through socialist programs.  @55million plus since RvW.  Sure, you didn‚Äôt make the ruling, but you didn‚Äôt do anything in your day bro stop the atrocity either.im not saying John Brown the clinics, but you called soldiers baby killers and left the suits in DC alone without much of a whimper.  Is it not fitting that the most selfish generation who not only killed their own children and enslaved mine with debt should be rejected? You had no sage like selfless transformation in the fourth turning.  You offer me nothing but bid me come and make your passing soft while you rot in hospice. I see you all on a daily basis clinging to a life unlived for one more day not to die. Get over yourselves.  Love others, embrace what you are, share what you‚Äôve learned, not all will listen, but some.  Be the best possible version of yourself whatever age you are, but quit bitching about your Medicaid and ankle pain and diabetes and chf when you were too dumb to read the labels for 50 years.

            I sympathize with that statement, but the most destructive politician of the 20th century is easily Woodrow Wilson. If Kennedy and Johnson destroyed a nation, Wilson wrecked an entire continent. Without American involvement, WW1 would have seen both sides fight to a stalemate with &lt;10k casualties, then hammer out a peace deal and go home.

        The Greatest Generation produced the Warren Court, LBJ, Civil Rights, and the 1965 Immigration Act. All the dysfunctional aspects of our current society ‚Äì including porn, racial unrest, government takeover of education, drugs, political correctness, and open borders ‚Äì all of these, were the result of actions taken by persons born between 1905 and 1926‚Ä¶the ‚ÄúGreatest‚Äù generation. They bequeathed to their boomer children all the tools we need to commit civilizational suicide.

            I agree, but it is even simpler than that, those whom extended the franchise to women are to blame.  Female voting patterns have changed the world, and not for the better.
I read a book many years ago which compared State and Federal budgets from before and after extension of voting rights.  EVERY destructive act and waste of money can be laid at the feet of politicians fueled by female votes.

                Women need to be red-pilled, not suppressed. It all comes down to education. (((Who))) determines what children are taught? What messages media/entertainment reinforces? (((Who))) determines what social mores are cultivated and advanced via our institutions, think tanks and governments? Women‚Äôs strengths of nurturing and building community are then exploited to achieve these ends. Alt-right men, you have no greater ally than women ‚Äî we are many and we are effective at impacting the world. Just as the political force of women was harnessed in the U.S. and given the right to vote and later even more involvement in running our society, you see the same kind of push for women‚Äôs involvement all over the world today. Look at the people and institutions backing this effort ‚Äî they‚Äôre all neo-liberal globalist Leftist Progressive type orgs. They are succeeding because they are using women. I can‚Äôt caution you enough on buying into bad ideas like MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) that aid the destruction of white Christian European heritage. Teach us, for we want to know the truth and support and love you. Red Pill all the women you know!

                    A better split of the generations is done by Strauss-Howe, with Boomers being 46-64, Gen X 65-80, etc. See Wikipedia for their breakdowns. Of course, all people do not ‚Äúfit‚Äù into a certain generational group, there are overlaps due to family structure or even parts of the country or country of origin. It works in a broad origin sense.

                        Note: there is a huge difference between GenXers raised by boomers and those raised by Silents/Greatests.
You see it was around the 1960s that improvements in pre-natal care made it possible for women to give birth late into their 30s. So for example, my mother was born in 1936 and I was born in 1970. My dad was born in 1934. But my ‚Äúpeers‚Äù who were conceived at Woodstock were like aliens to me.

                The youngest boomers are early-50s right now. Some of them could, in an ideal world, live another forty years or more.
But, absent a miracle, America won‚Äôt exist in twenty years. It simply cannot continue to exist as a nation when it‚Äôs been reduced to a mass of competing identity groups all trying to gain power over the others.
And none of those groups are likely to feel much sympathy for the people who created that situation.

I know boomers feel superior and yet what have they given us?  Our country is in debt, countless wars, corrupt politicians, corrupt and controlled media, a ruined healthcare system, a ruined educational system, a 200,000 dollar higher education more rules and regulations and less privacy and then, exported our manufacturing base to China.Young people have a right to be angry and to feel distrustful.

        It is hard for me to see the right in any of its forms succeeding because every group is obsessed with attacking the other groups while virtue signalling about how much better they are. Over time the majority of whites should logically move farther and farther to the right but most on the right doesn‚Äôt want that to happen.When you are slamming boomers are you talking  about the working class boomers who are struggling and enabled both Trump to win the presidency and Brexit to pass or the Wall Street hotshots?

        So much inter-generational scapegoating.  So much looking for the ‚Äòother‚Äô to blame for our current troubles instead of looking into the mirror of every generations‚Äô greed and envy.  Let‚Äôs start with the ‚Äògreatest generation‚Äô (the name itself is a preemptive rhetorical exoneration).  They won WWII _and_ they helped themselves to a really big slice of the cake of their descendants‚Äô earnings into perpetuity.  Over time: It took all of the ‚Äô50‚Äôs and much of the ‚Äô60‚Äôs, when Boomers were powerless, to get this done.For example, my own worthy mother (God rest her soul) was a casual office worker in between being a (more valuable, IMHO) stay-at-home Mom to a few of us larval Boomers.  Upon taking up the sad task of organizing her estate 20 years ago, I established that, upon retirement, she took out _in one year_ from the Fed system, that she and her peers and their immediate predecessors had created, the whole sum she had contributed over her entire working life.No Boomers did this: We did not create this Ponzi scheme that is eating us up today.  You may say we should have stopped this.  Agreed: But what about the rest of you_?

        My question about the boomercide is, what is the likely way for it to be done? Boomers seem to hate any form of the death penalty and have tried to completely outlaw it. Will the youngsters revive some of the old favorites, like the guillotine, or hanging, or drawn and quartered? Or will they go with the economical option since the Boomers spent all the money and just wack them over the head with a shovel into giant mass graves?It‚Äôs odd. After Reconquista 2.0 deports and kills all the foreigners, to follow up with a boomercide would almost seem oddly in line with the Elites desire to severely reduce the population.

She was undone by metastatic intelligence, undisciplined and out ouf control, which led her into contempt for the Boomer president, Donald Trump. As with so many people playing as spies, she was confident her smarts would allow her to outwit the dummies. I presume her candidate was Bernie Sanders, who was a pre-Boomer.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶ always left me wondering what they called the kids who came along in the late 70‚Äôs? They were technically Boomers, but they were nothing like the people who came of age in the 60‚Äôs.‚Äù
Factually incorrect. The Boomer gen has classically be defined as that group between 1946 ‚Äì 1964. A 1964 Boomer coming of age in the 70‚Äôs would start at 6 and end around 18. But by the end the ‚Äô70s were no longer the ‚Äô70s. Disco had died, the VN war was nearing its final peak before capitulation, and Reagan was on the horizon.

        I was born in 1963 and the marketers call me a second wave or late boomer.  However, I‚Äôve never identified with the boomers who came of age in the 60s and early 70s.  The author of the book, ‚ÄúGeneration X:  Tales of an Accelerated Culture,‚Äù which popularized the label, was himself born in 1963 and characterized GenX as people ‚Äúborn after 1960.‚Äùhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X:_Tales_for_an_Accelerated_CultureI think that‚Äôs about right.

        Aw, we‚Äôre not so bad. I‚Äôm a late boomer (class of ‚Äô76) so wasn‚Äôt part of the earlier hippie-dippy types.Not all boomers were hard left and not all boomers were twits. Some of us came of age in a time when jobs were scarce and interest rates were sky-high.We get blamed along with the first wave boomers though and the irony is most boomers spoiled the heck out of their kids. No gratitude. Then again, I guess for the ‚Äúgeneration gap‚Äù boomers, that‚Äôs payback.We‚Äôre all starting to die off anyhow ‚Äì the first wave is already going, so no need to push us off a cliff. Good luck with life ‚Äì you‚Äôll find that most people are rubbish and you‚Äôll learn to cherish the small minority, no matter what their birth decade, who aren‚Äôt.

            And the clever Boomer boys quickly learned how to leverage that fear, to their own benefit.  If the girls only knew what their mothers had been up to, all those years ago.  Back in the day, it was a lot easier to keep things hidden.

        (Y Chromosome‚Äôs the male one ‚Äî I just googled to make sure.)How would Boomer trust in Institutions (New York Times, Harvard?) derived from childhood TV-watching fit together with throwing away Western history and taking over those Institutions?  I‚Äôm not denying that this is so ‚Äî just wondering how this could be?The Hippie-Radicals were always grumbling about ‚Äúthe System,‚Äù weren‚Äôt they?  And I was surprised to find (I think in a book about Hitler and Stalin by Alan Bullock), that the Nazis used that very phrase!  They wanted to take down ‚Äúthe System.‚Äù  Alan Bloom (in The Closing of the American Mind) thinks that Heidegger dug the SDS types because ‚Äúthey reminded him of something.‚Äù  So those guys seem to have been pretty anti-institutional ‚Äî but they took over the institutions, and that‚Äôs why they trust them?Maybe I‚Äôm just missing your point.

            I fixed the missing word. I try to make each paragraph the exact same number of lines and sometimes cut out necessary words in an effort to achieve the aesthetic I prefer. I used to stick with five lines and I have tried four lines. They work a bit better on mobile devises, but it‚Äôs hard to make a point sometimes. Six lines seems to be a good compromise. But, mistakes can be made when making things fit.

                    Reading on-line is a different thing than reading text on a page. Long paragraphs just don‚Äôt work as the reader tends to start skimming, rather than reading. It‚Äôs a medium that rewards atomization. Judging from my traffic, most people are reading from a PC, but a decent number come here from a mobile device. Testing on my mobile devices, six lines is about one swipe. So, read a point, swipe to the next point.It does negatively impact the quality of prose and word choice, but this is a blog, not a Supreme Court filing. If I finish my book, I‚Äôll follow different rule editing it.

            Boomer‚Äôs distrusted institutions, in fact, hated them. Those campus protests weren‚Äôt just against the war, they were also against the ‚Äúman.‚Äù  To say Boomers trusted the NYT and other existing institutions is simply wrong, if you take the most Boomerish of Boomers as your ideal type.My hunch is this:  Boomers, like all generations, had their renegades, but most conformed to social norms of that time.  The renegades got the spotlight, tenure and j-school jobs.  Eventually, they also got to Wall Street, at least some of them.I was born in the early 1960s.  I attended public school in what is now Silicon Valley where I learned absolutely NOTHING: no grammar (New English), no math (New Math), no discipline ‚Ä¶ nada.  I got to the Ivy League for college because I was a reader and my father, a physicist, helped me get up to speed in math.  School was a wash, at best.  Now, remember, the teachers I had were from that Greatest Generation.  By the time I started school, it was already ruined.  I‚Äôm sure that the experience of those who lived in Iowa or other stable states was different than my experience in California, but there were already ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù areas in the late-1960s, long before Boomers came of age.

If he is against the alt right, judging from what I‚Äôve seen of him I‚Äôd say he is against them because he perceives them to be negative. I don‚Äôt agree that the alt-right is negative, I just don‚Äôt think Bill Mitchell cares about currying favour with the left.Bill Mitchell is a little bit of a lightweight, but I am forever thankful for what he did in the weeks leading up to the election. He was one of the few explaining what was happening with the polls. And he did it effectively through Twitter where you didn‚Äôt have to read through a bunch of garbage to get to the main point. On Election Day he kept Trump voters calm and explained where the Trump votes were coming from and to not be worried. Bill Mitchell is okay.

        I‚Äôve read all the way through the this thread and the one posted about ‚ÄúBoomercide‚Äù and it‚Äôs followup at Vox Day. I think the whole topic can be more accurately broken down by an r/K analysis about which the commentator ‚ÄúDarwin is a Harsh Mistress‚Äù (a great Heinlein reference) spoke to. Namely, about what occurred through those generations that were either r or K supporting and how that affected downstream generations (and the time lag associated with birth control and technology).I think you can break it down to on the political spectrum (left to right) with r-leftists -&gt; K-leftists -&gt; r-rightists -&gt; K-rightistsThis can also be described as: Progressives -&gt; Blue-Dog Dems -&gt; Cuckservatives -&gt; Alt-RightBut, with the middle two decreasing and by increased polarization to the extremes at both ends in more recent years.When viewed in this lense, we see how the greatest generation, silent generation, and boomers contributed to our current social collapse.They did this through trusting the traitorous (globalist) elite on legal changes, cowardice to the onslaught of social institutions, and the embrace of decadent libertine social and political pathologies and all the while not changing course when evidence was showing in the eighties and onwards that mistakes were made.How we move where we are though, I‚Äôm uncertain.P.S. I‚Äôm born in 79 (late gen-X) to parents who were born in the midwest in the early 50s (early boomers) and went through an early childhood where my parents divorced but where both my brother and I turned out all right since our blue pilled hard-working father got custody of the kids and possession of the house with no alimony paid (I know, NADART) instead of our alcoholic mom running the tables on dad, kinda like scared straight but for parenting.

        [‚Ä¶] All of this could simply be a bit of cosmic justice. The generally accepted theory is that Western culture collapsed in the 1960‚Äôs when the English speaking world allowed their kids to pull down the institutions that made all of it possible. That is certainly true. In fact, the Boomers have been like a wave of locusts, sweeping through each aspect of the culture as they aged, leaving nothing but waste behind them. In the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs they destroyed social norms. The 80‚Äôs they destroyed education. The 90‚Äôs is was politics. [‚Ä¶]

        ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ If you are a Boomer reading this, you are no doubt outraged, scandalized and offended at my comments. [‚Ä¶].‚ÄùNope. I was just thanking God that I didn‚Äôt grow up in the part of the country that you seem to have done. We had no such ‚Äúboomer phenomenon.‚Äù I was in a ballroom dancing/social graces class the evening MLK got himself shot, preparing to take my place in a world that had ceased to exist, though we did not know that then. As for my school teachers, I assure you that they didn‚Äôt know the location of the Ho Chi Minh Trail or the Woodstock playlist. I‚Äôm a boomer‚Äìyes, but apparently from a different world.

        Did good. Boomers, bammers, wammers, I blame them all. I especially blame the 50 yr olds born between certain dates. Or the 60 guys or maybe somebody else. Or maybe my son who‚Äôs 40. One true thing is, the 60‚Äôs did fuck this country up. Except for the one‚Äôs who didn‚Äôt. Do some more research. Many of us aren‚Äôt fucked up.

All this old boomer can say is, you have not described me in any way at all  recognizable, except by age.
I‚Äôll be back later to read the comments, &amp; see if commenters have any sense to impart to this drivel; until then I‚Äôll busy myself getting ready for Babymetal, which will hopefully drive this gallimaufry of idiocy out of my head!

                As a Gen-Xer, I‚Äôm thoroughly enjoying all the Boomer butthurt on this thread.  It‚Äôs clear a lot of these commenters subconsciously identify with that generation and all the horrific ideological outcomes it represents.
Let them stew in their anger, let them think, let them decide.  No generation is without sin.  The sooner they face reality the better.
