        zman, I have been enjoying your posts for about 6 weeks. Congratulations on kicking off your blog – it was long awaited. However, I found this post to be a little too disingenuous for my liking. Thou doth protest too much. I live in the third-world, without television but with internet. Although I have little idea of what is happening on prime-time or in the top 40, I know all too well who Kanye and Kim are. They are basically inescapable, akin to a neighbours rotting compost heap. You want nothing to do with it, but every morning when you leave the house, you must suffer it for a short while. Kayne and Drake never grew up in harsh surroundings but the likes of T.I, Lil Wayne and Juicy J come from the dregs of the community. They are wealthy beyond our wildest dreams. They all still cling to the filth they grew up amongst.I understand completely that someone (likely white/Jewish) has sat them down and explained that young white kids love this schtick and that if they ham it up, they will be sensationally rich. That person has gotten rich too.Dont condescend to your audience. It is as unlikely that you wouldn’t know who Miley Cyrus is as it would be that you wouldn’t know what a gas bill is.Keep it realWalt
