        It worked for 0bama, but it isn’t working for ruby, because the Republican voters, having been back-stabbed so many times by Republican politicians, have developed a better BS detector than the dims. The dim voters would gladly eat a dog turd if you shaped it into a square and called it a brownie.

        It was kind of refreshing listening to Mortemor call Billy Ray Valentine a “Nigger”.Refreshes my spirit and moral obligation as a Dirt Person as to my duty to resist and defy the sonofabitches trying to enrich themselves on the destruction of my country with everything I have.

        Nice summation of the Rubio phenomenon.  What puzzles me are those ‘conservative’ pundits who really believe their narrative.  Members of the Salem and Fox families talk up Rubio so earnestly that it forces me to question their bona fides: are they really so dumb or is this just a pantomime for the rubes?

        The Republicans really are the Stupid Party. They looked at Obama and said, “dang it, we need a handsome, youthful, metrosexual/bisexual/homosexual POC of international parentage just like that guy”. So they found Rubio, which on the surface looked like a good choice. What they forgot was the most important piece: Obama’s almost preternatural skill at delivering neuro-linguistic programming. Somebody not only took a lot of time to train Obama in these techniques, but– just as importantly– they hired speechwriters skilled in NLP to craft the content that Obama delivered. It’s why Obama is completely useless without a teleprompter: he is trained at delivering NLP content, but completely incapable of producing it himself. Rubio has clearly had neither the training, nor the speechwriters. And he is a lousy off-the-cuff speaker. He’s like Obama without a teleprompter, but even worse.Trump, on the other hand, has also adopted NLP and hypnosis techniques. But instead of delivering canned NLP content, Trump starts with a basic framework and then improvises as he goes along. If Obama is like a highly-trained Violin soloist following a conductor with a symphony behind him, then Trump is like a jazz saxophonist, riffing and reacting to what is happening in the moment.  It’s why he doesn’t bother with canned speeches– that would be like giving Charlie Parker sheet music.  Meanwhile, it’s no wonder the Republicans are helpless– they didn’t even learn anything from getting beaten by Obama, much less anticipate that Trump would take what Obama did to the next level.

        “Now that Marco is no longer of any use to Norman, that no-show job goes away.”
Nope. Dems are loyal to their apparatchiks, unlike Rpubs who are treacherous pricks.
Rubio will be given a nice job somewhere and effectively pensioned off.

            Well of COURSE Dem puppet masters  are loyal to their apparatchiks, if they produce, they continue to get paid by their masters, if they don’t, they STILL get paid, with OTHER peoples money.Isn’t that how Socialism, and Social Justice, works?

            I wonder. Cantor is a smart guy with a ton of connections in the ruling class. He was a consigliere, while Rubio has been a street hustler. There’s not a lot of value to keeping Rubio around as he has no pull in DC and he burned his bridges in Florida. Maybe he can sell cars at one of Braman’s dealerships.

                Rubio will be seriously used merchandise.  Weak and malleable, only connections have been with those using him.  That “Opportunist” in neon on his forehead won’t help.

        I think they’ll find a no-show job for Rubio.  He is young enough, and has eagerness to perform, he’ll land somewhere.  It will be interesting to see where Perry and Jindal go.  Surely to a think tank or something, right?  Both were heavily tied to GWB and that wing of the GOP… the wing that is getting clobbered.  What will happen to dear Karl and his white board?  Hmmm.

            Perry to a think tank?  I wonder.  He now reminds me of the attractive boy in high school who did not bear close scrutiny.  What we used to call a “sosh” for Social.  But   Not.  Too.  Bright.

            Rubio could return to state politics, which as the post implied he is much more suited for anyway.  Or maybe he runs for mayor of Miami-Dade, where he would still be useful to his benefactors, though that job probably requires some executive ability.In the UK in the eighteenth century they had House of Commons constituencies where no one lived, except for a few employees and tenants of some wealthy person.  These “rotten” boroughs were available to guarantee retainers of the influential seats in Parliament.  One motivation behind the Americans leaving the empire was to get away from that.  However, the campaign finance system has developed to do something similar, instead of providing a district, your wealthy benefactor can providing the funding and staff for a campaign.

Sailor sure busted Limbaugh today, although that wasn’t the point of the post. Funny thing is, most of his fans already know his faults, they just have no where else to go, sort of like many Trump voters.

            Limbaugh is the political version of the old radio preachers. Instead of selling a dashboard Jesus he sells ties, books, hats, etc. I think most people just assume he is smart enough to avoid crossing some lines. What Fox has done is pretty much treason. They rigged their news coverage to sell amnesty, knowing their viewers hate amnesty. If Trump starts pounding that NYTimes story, Fox is in very deep doo-doo.
