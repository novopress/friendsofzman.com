        Yeah, when it comes to drinking and partying with the “boys”,  all of a sudden fems want the protections of puritianism and chivalry.  Hard to have it both ways,  if I may use that term.

            What I find irritating about these stories is we used to have this stuff worked out. The role of males was to protect vulnerable females, not post pictures of them passed out on the floor of the fraternity. The role of females was to avoid getting stinking drunk around unattached and unfamiliar males.
These rules worked pretty well.
