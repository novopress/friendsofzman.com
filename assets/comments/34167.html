        Unfortunately, we are here at this moment because 100 or so years ago some very wicked people intentionally decided to unleash a bunch of lies. They admit in their writings. They came and they saw the scabs and wounds and weaknesses of men and their civilization. They willfully sewed discord through envy, jealousy, guilt, and turned strengths into weaknesses and weaknesses into strengths.They were tolerated. Worse, they were permitted entry and given access to buy and monopolize and command the heights of the society they sought to subvert. Some did it for the sheer pleasure of revenge. Some did it knowing they could take what was someone else’s and have it for their own.It really is that simple. Occidental man let aliens waltz into his civilization after savage bouts of ambition and vanity goaded him into mass scale destruction. Weakened and deluded he embraced an anti-morality that put him and his own people as the central villain of all of mankind. He embraced being labeled Satan as long as he personally was exempt from the consequences. The worst of him were so cowardly and craven that they even joined in the chorus of denigration and persecution of their own as Satan so as to be free to keep what he had or gain a bit more.The new paganism is just endless tumors showing up throughout the body. The remnant that is spiritually healthy and uncorrupted is in places like this one. Can the remnant survive and just let the tumor infested body rot? Or will they all perish if they don’t summon the will to excise the cancer and beat it into remission?The 59 Afrikaaners who just landed here are either a premonition or a wake up call. If the reaction to them doesn’t wake someone up to the coming darkness then they won’t wake up. For those of us in the real world, the work we have to do is just beginning.

        “The Gaia worshippers, for example, are not dealing in practical issues like the physical world when they demand sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.”

Most of those Gaia worshipers, the true adherents not the ones who know it is nonsense but are using it for nefarious purposes, are women. Without women making babies the society can’t exist.

This is why driving a stake through the heart of feminism is a necessity if the culture is to survive. As we all know, feminism causes women to go insane and lowers the birthrate.

            The key ingredient to toxic feminism is Critical Theory. Wanting something in your interest isn’t bad or unnatural; this holy mission is the absolutist need to “reform” White society into some vague whatever because White Man Bad.
Toxic feminism and CT reward our women for betraying their men and race. It tells them they are victims, that white men don’t value them. Imagine if the incentives rewarded both men and women for complementing each other and for White pride together rather than setting them at each other’s throats in a winner take all scenario.

            There’s been a 100+ year war on women. Lenin sounds a lot like a “3rd wave” feminist. Current trannie trends basically even turn men into better women than women.

                    Feminism molds women into men. It’s not easy being either sex of human though.

            Feminists are not wrong when they charge us with wanting to force them back into the home.
We have to convince them that domesticity will make most of them happier than competing with men.
They need praise so badly that we will have to force the media to celebrate domestic women and forbid the mocking or belittling of them.

                                Your comment got me to thinking of the banquet scene in Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, where a special pie was served. I originally thought it was the Nasty Piece of Work Tamora’s creation, as Hilary would be the type to prepare such a delicacy. Turns out that the pie was the work of the title’s “protagonist” and his ravished and mutilated daughter, and Tamora consumed it, not realizing its key ingredients until it was too late. Hint: it weren’t four-and-twenty blackbirds.

                “They need praise so badly that we will have to force the media to celebrate domestic women and forbid the mocking or belittling of them.”Women do need praise more than men. That is true. That said, how much of any human would celebrates being looked upon as a leech, an overly emotional baby oven, and only good for making sandwiches if there’s not money for servants is an open question. It’s not like men are excited to be janitors or seek that in terms of status.Modern fathers in particular seem eager to mold their easier to mold daughters into the sons they never had. (See: girl’s sports) Husbands are sometimes scared to be sole providers or even happy to let Mom have the boring job so they can follow their muse. I’ve even seen modern husbands derive their status from their wives, rather than from the other way around.The removal of feminism will require appreciating something more of the vocation about the feminine in men at large. It will then flow naturally to the women. How that happens I have no easy answers for.  I do know that a “the beatings until morale improves” approach is probably not going to work.

                    I agree with a lot of what you wrote but part of the problem is that you characterize a wife and mother as “a leech, an overly emotional baby oven, and only good for making sandwiches if there’s not money for servants.”
Is that how you really view good moms?

                        Yes, I agree that was overly harsh. No, that’s not how I view good Moms.I did try to edit that part, but the system didn’t let me because of a weird error that pops everyone .But to me that’s the modern view of women, built into almost it’s fabric of society. That’s why is super important that women have a career (don’t leech), take leadership classes (can we please keep those emotions in check??). When I occasionally stumble upon young reactionary types they aren’t taking their wives seriously beyond their meal making abilities. Certainly the MGOW types can’t see much beyond that too.I hope we’re on the edge of breaking that modern view. But the threads are still there everywhere, to the point where suggesting my daughter might be happiest as wife/mother, it’s still just a suggestion.

                        There’s a longer post waiting for approval. Just quickly though, I don’t view good Moms that way. I tried to edit it afterword as a bit too harsh but failed thanks to a weird error. More thoughts incoming.

                        Now, now. I think it’s part of the Black tax. Stuck at home with nothing but tedium and yapping kids gets to you. What women need, why they like the workforce- better yet, part time, on-and-off, not the daily grind- is they need a lot of society, like guys need buds. They just need a lot more women around at times, and stuck in a suburban box doesn’t cut it like having friends down the block or around the corner (or the fish market or church) dropping in all the time.

OTOH, I have known quite a few women who equate having a baby to something akin to being a cow (barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen).  They have somehow taken one of the most beautiful parts of womanhood and the human condition and turned into something ugly. Nobody does this more than feminists.

                It’s the visuals.  They say men respond to visual, well so do women in the biggest way.   On the TV was Good Morning America.  I turned the sound off, and there was the real message: segment on stronk empowered black social leader inspiration lady (who just needed funds), hard working independent happy Latina baker lady (who just needed a loan), and finally, dumpy stringy haired unemployed middle aged white depression lady, who just needed meds.

                This idea that women being stuck at home is largely an invention of feminism.  Most women had jobs, certainly before they were married.  A large percentage (though not most) had part time jobs at a minimum when they had kids at home.  Most women rejoined the workforce when their kids were old enough.  Of course, they leave out that most women had a choice in the matter.  Now most women do not have a choice and are forced to work.Most of what the feminist peddle are lies, half truths or distortions.But the success of feminism never ceases to amaze me.  They manage to convince women that staying home with their children was slavery and that sitting in a cube all day at a job they hate is freedom.

                    I’ve recently been looking at theses and dissertations written by students in a university in West Texas back when West Texas really was rightwing–ca. 1930 to 1980. It’s remarkable how many of them were written by females. So much for the notion that women were effectively blocked from higher education until the sexual liberation of the late sixties. And I think it’s safe to say that all these female advanced degree holders didn’t return to their “domestic dungeons” to pop out Peggies, Patricks and Pop Tarts.

It was the invention of the Jewess Betty Friedan, who wrote in 1963 that suburbs were “comfortable concentration camps” for women.

            ‘This is why driving a stake through the heart of feminism is a necessity if the culture is to survive.’
Feminism rules now and has for many decades. The results speak for themselves.
Women love it and so do the elite. But it’s a cancer, however profitable to some. Destroy it or it’ll destroy you.

Big Pharma, Big Gov and Dotter Daddy are very happy with this arrangement, although it ruins the nation and its future.  The Left opens the borders to replace the men they supplanted, and the children they aborted or simply failed to have.

                And feminism is destroying society in every way imaginable. Jews come up with the plans but it is primarily women who implement and inforce them. Gaia worship, legal invasions, etc are all driven by women.
Even in South Korea where they haven’t let feminists flood the country with invaders, feminists are leading the country to extinction with the lowest birthrate on the planet.

                    I agree with your general assessment of women. However, the fairest observation suggests some base issues in men as well. In other words the fall involved both Adam and Eve.People are usually so exited about being put in charge or “chosen” that they don’t listen to the details. Moses was quite clear that the Israelites at the time were only marginally better than their surrounding nations. Listening to the “adventures” in the desert, it appears God’s choice was between really pretty awful and really, really pretty awful. That’s all of humanity too.It’s not a good thing to be so down on your half of humanity nor are you necessarily a unicorn. Rare yes. Unicorn, no.

Stupid has costs people don’t have the will not to bear when they can afford to waste. It’s easier that way. Has nothing to do with what’s good, right, reasonable, or natural.

            Here’s a nice data point on our beloved wammens from Zero Hedge athttps://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/umich-sentiment-collapses-near-45-year-record-lows-democrats-inflation-dissonance“one-third of women surveyed believe inflation over the next year will be 15% or higher…”So the wammens believe that inflation will reach a level that it never has in the US except right around WWI and then flirted with at the end of the Carter years –https://www.macrotrends.net/2497/historical-inflation-rate-by-yearThe really damning thing is that most of these silly bints could never tell you exactlywhatthe mechanism for that was supposed to be. How would such a thing come about? I mean if you had expected 15% inflation during Biden’s Great Coof there was at least the fact that the government was dumping trillions into the economy by giving people money for nothing. The cause/effect relationship is easy to see.Of course with women the cause is always “because Orange Man bad!”. They will also believe things that are 180 degrees from the truth such as the idea that Russia is losing the war in Ukraine. How is that possible? Well, Russia bad, Ukraine good! Renewable energy works for the same reason. Renewables good, fossil fuels and nukes bad! It’s always some simple minded cartoon morality tale. This prevents them from ever understanding how anything actually works in the real world and understanding how the world works is, or should be, a prerequisite for making important decisions about it. Or, in a lot fewer words, and as one of the ZH commenters put it…Repeal the 19th Amendment.

        The Mainline Protestant denominations apparently aren’t that far gone if you look beyond the pulpit into the pews. In the last podcast from Anglican Unscripted (914), one of the topics the hosts discussed is that the laity of the Mainline Protestant congregations like the United Methodist Church (UMC), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the Presbyterian Church USA (PCUSA), and others voted 60-40 in favor of Trump. Their pastors and bishops (or whatever equivalent to bishop they use) are all loony dingbats, but the average person in the pew is downright sick of the nonsense. People want the nation and religion of their forefathers, not to be dragged kicking and screaming into the “golden light of modernity.”The exception was the Episcopal Church of the United States of America (ECUSA) which was 40-60 for Trump (still somewhat impressive), but that’s largely due to the fact that the Anglican Church of North America broke off from them, siphoned off the vast majority of their conservative parishioners, and rivals them in numerical adherents (last time I checked was in 2015 and they’ve probably surpassed them) if not monetarily (cat lady endowments are not to be underestimated).

            On a side note, the Episcopalians hate whites so much, they refused their resettlement services to the 59 South African asylum seekers.  They actually turned down the money!
It might not have been Woke racism, however.It might have been because these were the first asylum seekers waving American flags.

                I agree with your assessment but the leaders of the church said that they withdrew because the white refugees had been moved ahead of non-whites. Their objection was not not that the refugees were white but that they received special privileges.
But we know it’s simply because the refugees are white.

                    That’s important.
Trends toward atheism, orthodoxy, atavistic antler-hat goofiness, etc., are all caused by a shared quality of every mainstream religion:They’re all liars.
So adherence is reduced to those too dumb to notice, too weak to object, or who revel in it.
Catholicism is exemplary—the true church!—a civilization-erasing horde of retarded browns led by a conspiracy of evil faggots, defended by American bullshit.﻿

The Biden 10 million ahead of them didn’t matter. That the Pisskeys were flying over to Africa to scoop up more years ago didn’t matter. Oh no, white people under a death sentence should’ve had to wait some more.
The Ramaposa admin is spamming and crashing the emmigration application website. Expropriation of property means ALL property, not just farmland, but even the watch on your wrist. And now, noggers are “eligible” for the Afrikaaner program.

                    They said it was because they believe in ‘racial reconciliation’ but in this case reconciliation meant the white people having their property confiscated by the government with no compensation, and that’s when they aren’t being attacked and tortured and murdered.
Can they even hear themselves? And as an American you have to think, ‘so if that happened to white people in America would they take the same stance?’ And the answer is evidently yes!

                        The Afrikaaners were accused of cowardly fleeing to avoid the consequences of “past injustices”.  I.e., they should meekly submit to a death penalty because of some things their forefathers are said to have done.
Austin Metcalf apparently also deserved to die, for much the same reason.

        When my main car died in 2019, I traveled to my work just south of LA by Metrolink from Orange County. What I saw was very informative. The train passed by working class Latino neighborhoods like Downey, Santa Fe Springs, and offered a peak into the backyards. At Christmas, there were lights in the backyard. Out in front, they would be stolen, but people there still wanted Christmas cheer. So the lights were just in the backyard, for their own enjoyment. There was also considerable Christian graffitti along walls and fences bordering the train tracks. Along with gang graffitti of course.You don’t see that sort of graffitti in black neighborhoods, i.e. Christian graffitti referencing Jesus saving YOU. At least I’ve never seen it, and I’ve driven through quite a few (unfortunately).At the same time, Santa Muerte is basically Coatlicue. For those who don’t know, after the Conquest of Mexico in 1520, that statue (the mother ofHuitzilopochtli the Aztec Death God) was buried. It was exhumed accidentally while digging a canal in 1790 and the inhabitants of Mexico City immediately started worshipping her with offerings. The Priests had it buried again, it was exhumed in 1823 and put in a museum. The Cartels are very devout adherents of Santa Muerte, doing things like luring thousands to a remote area with fake job offers, and staging a Hunger Games killing contest. Ordinary people with picks and shovels looking for their relatives went to the remote ranch in Jalisco and found all sorts of human remains. Mexican federal and state authorities knew of the mass killing and covered for it.And that is the tension in Mexican society. On the one hand, monotheists who believe/hope in a loving God that cares about them and offers them comfort. On the other hand, the traditional pantheon of gods who have NOT gone away and offer sadism and cruelty. Mesoamerican society was based on cruelty, slavery, human sacrifice, and the enjoyment of sadism on a very wide level, and a very stratified social structure. Seen best in Apocalypto which is fairly accurate. Point being is that non-Whites don’t think like us, they often are polytheistic, their social goal is often cruelty and sadism, but what White civilization offers is special, unique, and desired. The appeal of the Blessed Virgin as comforter and mother to Mexican society post-conquest was pretty self-evident.

            While you aren’t far off as far as their duality, motives and proclivities, there’s very little in narcoreligion that has to do with anything traditionally Mesoamerican. Most of it’s pretty recently borrowed from Afro-Carib syncretic cults like Santeria and Palo Mayombe, slapped with a veneer of dollar-store We Wuz Azctecs mestizaje as ginned up by deranged Marxists like Kahlo early in the last century.

Oh yes, they are back.  With a vengeance.
As for reliance on the ‘blessed virgin’, I will withhold further comment, except to say that in mesoamerica devotion to that person is far more common than that of Christ.

        Christianity in the south is still prospering by splitting away from mainline liberal denominations.  The Presbyterians are fractured – PC USA being the woke side that people are leaving for more traditional sects like PCA and ECO.
The Chicago Lutheran synod has rainbow flags everywhere – so the Missouri and Wisconsin synods are growing by being traditional.
The Methodist church split up last year.  Many of them around here went to the conservative Global Methodist side.
There are traditional Anglican churches that aren’t insane like the Episcopalians

            What the Left cannot control it seeks to destroy. As the traditionalists within these denominations splinter, the Progressive-controlled rump will wither and die and then seek to infiltrate and gain control of those they forced out. This is true of any type of group. O’Sullivan got part of it right, but being explicitly rightwing is only a piece of it. Constant vigilance also has to be explicit.

        I think what we are really seeing is “clearing the decks of Christianity”.With female preachers promoting the alphabet lifestyle in mass worship concerts with “thousands of converts” it’s exactly what is described in The Revelations.False teachers in the thousands. Bizarre religious groups like Christian Scientists and all flavors of pseudo-Christian sects. The normalization of immoral and deviant lifestyles, pedophilia via grooming gangs and even bestiality (1). Additionally there’s more and more promotion of demons and Satan becoming part of mainstream media; HBO, Netflix, etc.Islamification is a real thing in the UK and many larger cities across Europe and despite the talk of reducing immigration, the damage was done 40-years ago and isn’t going to be reversed or even slowed.If there ever was an age that fit the descriptions of the end time, I can’t think of a better one.(1) 6 March 2023 – Spain deleted Article 337 of the Criminal Code concerning sexual acts between humans and animals and replaced it with a new article criminalising bestiality if an act injures an animal to such an extent that intervention by a veterinarian is necessary.

            “Islamification is a real thing in the UK”, but not in Germany,Netherlands, or France?!“Larger cities”. Small towns in France and Sweden are majority Muslim.Do you actually live in Germany? German under fives are 50% Muslim.The country which,per capita, sent more volunteers to Isisland was Belgium.Wasn’t Belgium the country which had a political party for “refugees”?The UK is not an outlier for western Europe.

        One thing to keep in mind, after the conquest of Mexico, there were still very few Spaniards and very many Mexicas, even after the plagues. They did not revolt. Indeed the longest resisting were the Mayas (in the 1690s the last city state was finally conquered), and the tribes to the north particularly the Apache.The reason was that the priests insisted that the sacrifices were the only reason the sun came up in the morning. When the Spaniards ended the sacrifices, everyone knew the priests were lying. That it was all for nothing.There is nothing more dangerous to a religion than being proven false. While there are adherents of Santa Muerte, and they are very, very dangerous, the appeal on a wide social basis is about zero. It appeals to the pre-existing population of psychopaths who enjoy other people’s suffering.Wokeness is in danger of being proven false. In that its sacrifices, when ended, will not end in disaster but quite the opposite. And very many of its adherents would know it was all for nothing.[The YT dude Whatifalthist holds that Mesoamerican society was far crueler even than the Babylonians and Assyrians because it was subject to frequent and catastrophic droughts and floods due to El Nino / La Nina. Yucatan is fairly arid, even though it has trees, it is not a rain forest like say the Amazon. He also notes that Mesoamerica had no concept of the individual and individual freedom unlike Amerindian tribes to the North and West like the Souix and so on with far lower population density. And that also, there is some evidence to suggest both Vikings and the Chinese had landed in Mexico around the 900s. But that otherwise Mesoamerica was isolated from other civilizations and faced no real outside challenge to make them shape up internally for better mobilization of resources and internal cohesion.]

                Definitely worth exploring. Essential, I’d say, because it gelled, it worked, amidst dozens of cults that didn’t.
They were dealing with all we’re dealing with: immigration, politics, corruption, multiculturalism, hostility, even a collapse in fertility.
(One part of that was silvania, a Greek plant as either a contraceptive or abortifacient that had grown a bit too popular amongst upper class ladies.)

            Christians are allowed to discuss the rules of early Christianity. Unfortunately many modern people, regardless of religious outlook, don’t want to hear that God/Jesus left a specific group of people in charge of the earthly Church, all of whom were sinners. What modernity spreads as an idea is that order to have authority, someone must be perfect morally and absolutely wise their decision making. It’s also a reflection of the Blob’s opinion of themselves. Part of the group Trump meltdown is having a man clearly shielded by God who is so obviously less than perfect getting things done.So if the next step in the rules discussion is that the early Church was full of petty no good horrible dictators (or everyone should have been voting from home churches), that’s simply a modern kvetch with little basis in what seems to have actually occurred.

        The race issue is where the differences in morality and metaphysics make clear that the gaps are two [sic] large to traverse. If you think magic is why black people commit so much more crime than whites […]
The problem isn’t that some people think the explanation for this is magic, but that many people don’t even see it as crime.  viz. Karmelo Anthony and the money being raised on his behalf.

        Loss of a shared morality is proving particularly troublesome in the Puritanical United States. Numerous competing moralities in such a fanatical country means many sects will claim to be The One True Faith. As one group comes to the fore and the others recede, the deadeners will scream and holler and demand a return to primacy. We see this now with Negro Worship, well past its peak and now moving from fatigue to distaste. While those on Team Black are far less in number than previously, they continue to be many and are outraged that their centrality has ended. Gaia worship is experiencing a similar trajectory as the need for more electricity to support AI trumps Net Zero; as Greta and Al rail all the louder further in the background they continue to shed followers who gravitate to the new thing.The United States has been post-Christian for some time now, but the void was filled by a secular civic nationalism, which in effect was a religion with the same Puritanical zeal. The post-nationalism imposed from above features mass migration and demonization of the majority and is proving at least as fatally divisive as the Reformation. If the globalists engineered these racial and cultural schisms as a divide and conquer strategy, and I think that is what happened, they were too clever by half. A rare common denominator is evolving into hatred of them for a multitude of reasons. The revelations that Klaus Schwab was looting the WEF treasury before his exit, for example, indicates at least some of them know the time has come to get while the getting was good.A society without a common morality or shared history and idenity will fracture and fall apart. We are well into the process and it is irreversible. The fragmentation and sorting are accelerating and it is impossible to ignore now. All human beings are tribal. Some were just better at hiding it.

            Hail the Reconquista!  If we fall, you gents are our backup plan.
It only took a few Spaniards last time (and only a few colonists up here), and you lads already had the stones to boldly go forth to settle in foreign lands in our oldest tradition.  One has to admit, those who came before had the gumption because they were girded by faith.

        World War One was fought between Christian nations. Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Great Britain, France, Belgium, and so on. Ten million presumably Christian men were killed in this ridiculous war which, to this day, cannot be explained as to its motives or objectives. WW1 just “kinda happened”. Not one country involved benefited from this war. If there was a “victor” it would be the nascent American empire.
The rulers of each combatant country leaned hard on Christianity to bamboozle their doomed armies into fighting for “God and Country”.

        FWIW, the Supremes ruled 7-2 that Trump cannot deport illegals. So there it is.
An imaginative response would be to house illegals right next door to each of the Supremes who voted that way, carefully selecting for the worst of the worst, and assigning DEI hires to the protective squad. Hopefully as obese, female, and black as possible.

                Germany is passing a law forbidding anyone from leaving. Assumption is this is prepatory for an EU wide draft. So there is that. Besides the number of Third Worlders coming &gt; any possible Europeans. And the Supremes will inevitably rule that no, we can’t bring in White people as that is immoral, only sacred holy non-Whites.

            Not sure just what the current ruling will entail, but it would seem to not be the end of the process.  If one avenue is closed, a second must be developed.  I would consider how well we can “sour the milk” for IA’s.  Enforce the restrictions upon welfare and employment and see how many voluntary deportations we can entice.  I would say a heck of a lot.Just yesterday on a “reality” show featuring Customs and Border Patrol, they showed a family crossing the border and claiming asylum.  They were interviewed, given a court date and a bus ticket to Las Vegas to be with “family” there pending an official hearing date many years into the future.  How is this possible—even with the Courts—except with the cooperation of the Fed’s?  Expand the “pro temp” immigration judges such that each asylum seeker is given a court date within 30 days and for those 30 days they are held in detention, or even not allowed to cross the border—let MX house them.I have read that in the prior great “migration” (early 20th century and prior to generalized welfare among the States) it was estimated that 40% of the new immigrants went home because they could not make it here—and this was when one could freely work for any wages they could get. I maintain it is the same, or worse, today.  IA’s—even those employed—survive by welfare benefits and not by dint of personal effort or merit.  They have only two purposes, to keep wages suppressed and to vote Democrat.

        Bantus are a race, not a tribe.  Most of the rest of the races in Africa are extinct, though I think Bantus are known to hold Pygmies as slaves in parts of Africa.  AFAIK, all African Americans are Bantu.  I’m pretty sure that one time when Whitey started colonizing parts of Africa, there were many of these races still around.  Most of the tribes in Africa are now just Bantu, but they do not see themselves as some kind of Bantu brotherhood.

                Maybe white people came from the African albinos, or twins, or the people the Africans bullied and wanted to murder and use their pieces in voodoo type rituals, and they think they get power from abusing us, but they left Africa many eons ago and became specialized: IOW Europeans and exceeded Africans because fuck them by leaps and bounds and they still want your essence, who knows…in any matter we don’t have to put up with that bullshit, then or now.

        I generally agree with your closing statement in that whatever formation we’d want for a group identity a shared ethos of some sort will be required.  Optimists think that Christianity can be reformed to this end and all I can say is “maybe” and, well, there’s no other ideas besides that I’ve seen*.*(Strict White nationalists will point genetic clannishness being the basis and while I think their point has some validity I just don’t think it’s workable; too many White nationalist men with…”not White nationalist” wives).

            As a practicing Catholic, I cannot emphasize enough that a sincere Christian faith cannot be “reformed” to the liking of a nationalist of any color. That is not the point of the faith. Any good social by-products are just that, by-products. If we reach for Heaven as a group, we start to make a little of it imperfectly here. The by-products of Christianity cannot be attained by dishonestly discarding the faith itself.That said, Europe was losing her religion no later than the late 19th century. The Great War in 2 parts of the early 20th century was a lot of white nationalism on super steroids. If the default model of white nationalism is 1930’s Germany, then yeah, it didn’t end well regardless of openness on the JQ. (H-man was also very interested in a replacement religion for Christianity, although I don’t think it was that hard to tear most away at the time. He did co-habitat with his girlfriend, was a vegetarian, and ultimately committed suicide, without an apparent blink by anyone.)“We be high fiving over being Caucasian” has never been a realistic basis for any society nor peace between distant cousins. The early 20th century demonstrates that once everyone bonds over being superior based on nationality, they start noticing all their co-ethnics they are also superior to. There was a baseline agreement between the English and Germans that they were all superiors to the Poles, for instance. But we still all got dragged along into 50 year contest for world domination between the Germans and English.Then the Silents and the Baby Boomers generation decided their immediate ancestors were kind of dorks and started their apology tours. And here we are.

        I’ve been thinking on your earlier shows about managerialism and I’ve decided that this is in itself a religion. Its creed is, “The managers are never wrong,” which is why nobody can admit how badly they botched the Covid response. A corollary is that though managerial rules are never rescinded, they CAN be made stricter. We can see that in the steadily intensifying war on smoking.

        The European cultural decline is a part and parcel of the same decline as America. They are just a bit later as they still had some semblance of an aristocracy. It isn’t the end of the Cold War that caused it. It really began with the rise of the Merchant caste a few hundred years ago. Like anything, the collapse is slow and then it accelerates linearly and then exponentially.The best and most comprehensive critique of Europe’s cultural collapse is, “Enemy Of the Disaster”, by Renaud Camus.The Managers want this. They want a population of standardless, low impulse control consumers whose only path to happiness is what we say already 4 decades ago in the negro culture expressed in hip-hop/rap.

        your summary here is so spot on. When I read this stuff, it makes me angry that more people don’t see this and understand it.

        As far as a set of incompatible pagan moralities animating a society, well we have the example of the Aztecs and Maya. Each Mayan city state had its own gods that were incompatible with the other city states, and each fought the other to annihilation — no sense of Mayan nationalism present. The Aztecs presided over a giant semi-slave empire, with slaves and human sacrifice required as tribute from conquered people.What happened is that only force with no outside challenge could sustain those societies. The Aztecs were able to conquer their neighbors by using a very large and well motivated Warrior caste who went to live as overlords of the conquered people. As the society was very stratified the only way upwards for Aztec men was to join the warbands.The Europeans are not going to allow a “deal” ending the Ukraine war, and are barreling headlong into drafting their White males to “solve” the issue of White men existing. War in Ukraine is spreading to Europe, which will force the US to intervene. Clearly Europe tells the US what to do, not the other way around. I can’t figure it, but there it is. You saw not just with Trump with Europeans lecturing him but also Biden and even Obama. I don’t know why or how, just that it exists clearly.I think absent the threat and force a long war against China and/or Russia and/or Iran would present, the West can continue its Aztec mode. However, with all sorts of threats including Islamist coups in Europe (likely helped along considerably by Putin/Russia/China) the Regime of Paganism will shatter like the Aztecs.

Analogous to Mexico of today. The only upward mobility for the nacos from the barrio is to become a soldier for the cartels.

        The Thirty Years War is one that I haven’t delved into yet. I don’t suppose anyone here could recommend a good read on it?

        “This new paganism is in some way an effort to create a new universal morality to replace the old one and use it to clear the decks of the alternatives.”So true.  So true.  I certainly took to heart the admonition that “we need a new religion!”Something real, this time, as the times demand; what we find, though, is that the new cannot discard the old.I say we see the old religion(s) not in the light of new interpretation as the Woke and each splitting before them, but in the light ofre-discovery.Let’s examine what they were actually talking about in the times in which they lived.
