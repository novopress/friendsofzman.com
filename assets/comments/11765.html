        Yes, this is yet another example of the transitioning of our society from the old to the new. People like Weinstein, Affleck, and Kimmel genuinely believed that their angry Progressive facade will inoculate them from zombie mob attack, and now they have become men without a country. No one wants them. Their old tribe views them as dead men walking and is gleefully gorging on their guts. And the Red Tribe will not take them in because they never had any guts to begin with. The depravity of Hollywood isn‚Äôt just about sex or politics, it‚Äôs the old story of unbridled power corrupting systemically. If we had a real news media, Washington DC would be next.

        It was members of the Tribe who created Hollywood and they still repreesnt the vast majority of its big wigs.As to the why of pornography, we have the testimony of a member of the Tribe:‚ÄúBecause Christ sucks‚Äù is why Jews are involved in pornography said Al Goldstein.There was a time‚Äì 1930s ‚Äì when the Catholics had those Hollywood bastids by the balls and they were squeezing them so bad (boycotts) that the Tribe was publicly bawling and so the Catholics forced them to accept The Code which prevented The Tribe from being moral sappers of America.Sadly, Catholic Bishops lost their courage and pornography began to flourish and it did its intended job- to undermine Christian morality in AmericaThis is not only well known, it is well-documented.

            Ironically, the Hayes code forced film makers to be more creative and subtle.  This resulted in better quality movies.  It‚Äôs kind of a guilty pleasure to watch pre-code movies with all their naughtiness üôÇ  And the stars were much better looking too.

                The old Barbara Stanwycks and the Nick and Nora movies were great fun, watching the actors stay just inside the boundaries of the Hayes code.  Stanwyck, of course, could get a rise out of the male audience simply by reciting the A B C‚Äôs into the camera.  No one in film today is capable of that.

                Foxman then fell back on the same justification for obscenity that Irving Thalberg used in his fight with the Legion of Decency. Pornography is controlled by ‚Äòconsumers,‚Äô most of whom are Gentiles. Therefore, Gentiles are ultimately responsible for pornography. According to Foxman, even if Jews dominate a particular field, as is the case with both Hollywood and the related pornography industry, that bears no relationship to the fact that they are Jews, no matter how one defines the term. To say otherwise is to be an anti-Semite.

        wait until all the pedo dirt starts coming out, there won‚Äôt be a hollywood person left in the country (that isn‚Äôt in prison) once that dam breaks.  and as you mentioned, the cost and means of production have now reached a level that anyone with a story and a few friends can make a decent quality movie.  ask the record industry how that worked out for them.

            The fact that virtually the whole of the Hollywood elite came out and signed a petition asking for a ‚Äúnever mind‚Äù on a guy that deliberately drugged and sodomized a thirteen year old summed it up.

        The other benchmark I always used was the mass entry of Asian money.  Outside of making shit, they have an absolute blind spot on real estate and cultural stuff.  The Japanese went from being sixteen feet tall to pissing all their money away on real estate, golf courses and entertainment.  Now the Chinese can take their turn.

        Z Man;An interesting logical construct on the ubiquitous ‚Äúwhy now‚Äù questions about this affair.  As to ‚Äúwhy Harvey‚Äù, most people can‚Äôt imagine that he was the worst of the Hollywood moguls, (although this *is* possible) so that mystery remains.But I wonder about the direction of causation of the three factors you cite, namely the advent of disruptive technology, the ‚Äòpower skirts‚Äô (love that) showing up and the smart money leaving: Which is first_?Having watched this horror play out up close and personal in a medium-high tech business in a prior life I recall that it was first the disruptive technology.  The smart guys in charge even knew that it was coming but earnings targets and organizational inertia prevented effective adaptation.  If by ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô you mean Wall St. sharks, then I‚Äôd tentatively agree that it was second.  But few of the smart guys inside left early, mostly due to ‚Äògolden handcuffs‚Äô, and some that did leave early ended up broke because they weren‚Äôt actually as smart as they thought.Power skirts showed up after the stock price went to a market average P/E.  The mostly decorative Board of Directors started to parachute them in after a couple of years of disappointing earnings. They apparently hoped to buy favor with The Cloud so as to get that disruptive technology disrupted via regulation.  It was during the Clinton I era, and since the BOD was decorative, they didn‚Äôt realize that you had to *pay* as well as to signal your obedience.  Harvey did knew that, for sure, and yet it didn‚Äôt help him in the end: Hence the mystery of ‚Äúwhy Harvey‚Äù.Finally, after the PC pogroms got going, the inside smart guys with life options bailed out.  Bereft of cis white males who knew how to run things, the company was taken apart and the pieces sold off.So the causal chain in that case was: 1, Disruptive technologies &gt; 2, Eroding earnings &gt; 3, Share price stagnation (outside smart money leaving) &gt; 4, The BOD Awakens &gt; 5, The Ride of the Power-skirt Valkyries &gt; 6, Inside smart guys taking their money and running (inside smart money leaving) &gt; 7, Eventual collapse.  If this framework is accurate, then Hollywood is at Stage 4 heading for Stage 5, hence la affaire Herve.

            Harvey was no longer able to make anyone rich or famous, so he was viewed as weak and vulnerable. It‚Äôs always how these things go. In corporate America, old guys who have not kept up with the times are always the first targets of the cackling hens in HR.
Next they will come for the gay casting directors.

To the best of my knowledge, Defense Contractors are essentially unfettered by social justice. Curiously, much more so than military themselves. I‚Äôve often thought of this as a paradox, but perhaps it‚Äôs simply the modern paradigm of expensive hardware and expendable troops.

                        Issac;Great answer.  And it explains the advent of the ubiquitous defense contractor.  They are relatively unburdened by the parasite load that our military must carry due to previous Cloud ‚Äòsupervision‚Äô.  And, because ‚Äòstuff‚Äô must still  get done out in the badlands, they are the ‚Äògo-to‚Äô by inside people that still care about results instead of process.  Sadly, they are fewer and fewer.

                        ‚ÄúAn increase in the influence of women in public life has often been associated with na- tional decline. The later Romans complainedthat, although Rome ruled the world, women ruled Rome. In the tenth century, a similar tendency was observable in the Arab Empire, the women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolised by men. ‚ÄòWhat,‚Äô wrote the contemporary historian, Ibn Bessam, ‚Äòhave the professions of clerk, tax-collector or preacher to do with women? These occupations have always been limited to men alone.‚Äô Many women practised law, while others obtained posts as university professors. There was an agitation for the appointment of female judges, which, however, does not appear to have succeeded.Soon after this period, government and public order collapsed, and foreign invaders overran the country. The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women to move unescorted in the streets, with the result that this feminist movement collapsed. ‚ÄùSir John Glubb in ‚ÄúThe Fate of Empires‚Äù

I really don‚Äôt know the answer.
But I‚Äôm encouraged by what has happened to organizations that dirt people have stopped supporting.  Macys.  Target.  Mainline churches.  The trog and prog  party structures.  Cable TV.  ESPN.   TV and print news.  The NFL.  Hollywood.
Don‚Äôt expect any of these initial changes will continue in the right direction by themselves.  And remember that your and your friends‚Äô support or withdrawl of support has consequences.
Meanwhile, I‚Äôd really enjoy watching academia take some widespread, sustained ridicule and get some serious competition.

                There‚Äôs also a generational factor involved; the old saying that ‚ÄúThe first generation builds the business, the second makes it a success, and the third wrecks it‚Äù is in play here.

            Usually there is some sort of catalyst that triggers these shifts.  Weinstein mastered being a creature of two coasts and DC.

            Academy deans and superintendents have become SJW lightworkers to meet service diversity standards.  Usually, this comes in the form of bringing in non-white athletes who have to go to the academy prep schools before attending the academies themselves.  To offset the dum-dums, white cadets must be smarter than ever before.  This is bad because most of these people belong in R&amp;D not flying planes (though you don‚Äôt want dummies doing this) or commanding dum-dums.  The behavioral standards are also lowered for the nonwhites and women; the latter get passed-around by the academy men.  The white cadets are expected to believe the new dogmas of homosexuality and transgenderism so they can get past O-3.  I think few want to now, judging by my time as an officer and having family who have gone to one of the academies.Note that Greg Popovich is a USAFA grad.  This virtue-signalling cuck is pretty representative of Boomer white men who have graduated our elite military institutions and lost their way or never had it.  They don‚Äôt care about much beyond alumni events.

        An axiom of modern, life is that the arrival of social justice warriors is a sign that a business or industry has entered a death spiral. It may not be dead, but its days of making big money have come to a close. The smart-money men, interested only in making money, have left the scene, leaving the people with other agendas to take over and impose those agendas. That‚Äôs when the gals start running off the guys for being male and cook up schemes to help under-represented minorities realize their potential.One can only hope that this is what is happening to university health care systems.

            This story has been trying to get out for years, going into a decade or more.  Why now?  Because when the vultures cannot feed off of the carrion of others, they turn on their own.  The culture has inoculated itself against Hollywood, and has basically dumped Hollywood along the side of the road, so the Hollywood people must climb over each other now to get to the top.  They can no longer feast on the riches provided by the rest of the culture buying movie tickets (yay!).  Hollywood is returning to its relatively dirt-poor carny roots.  Washington might be undergoing a similar reversion to its roots, if we are lucky.Slightly OT, but I visited a place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, last week, called Meow Wolf.  One of these ‚Äúexperience‚Äù places, kind of an exercise in pointless mental overstimulation, perfect for selfies and talking about it on Facebook.  Disney has to be crapping in its pants over this sort of thing, because it has everything the Disney theme parks lack, once you get to be over about six years old.  It is social, free roaming (no lines), and full of things you have never seen or contemplated before, and all served at breakneck pace and rather hallucinatory in nature.  You come out of it mentally wrung out (at least you do if you are in your fifties).  I have seen the future, and Disney, movie theaters, and even home entertainment, as it currently exists, ain‚Äôt it.

                The people paying for the Dems have had enough.  Love to be a fly on the wall when the word comes down that it is time for a bunch of these old Dem hacks to pack it up and hit the road.  The Republican side, too.  They are not going to go quietly.  They have deluded themselves into thinking they are doing God‚Äôs work, for a healthy skim off the top for themselves.

        Last Hollywood film I watch is Gran Torino. I do not miss much about Europe, except food from super market (truly stereotype but food in Americna grocer is terrible) and cinema. English film like Harry Brown is needed, anti-PC thug ghetto culture but Hollywood liberals will never dare approach this.

        It is actually worse than that.  Hollywood has quality and production like the Auto industry in 1970.  Union shop rules (see how long the credits are, best boys, gaffers, wardrobe, hairdressers, makeup‚Ä¶ all separate jobs).So it takes $100 Million to do a movie?  Where does it all go?  Some to the stars, but a lot to a production line that is not post Deming, Just in Time, efficient.Would Justice League work if it was entirely animated but kept the script?They brought Peter Cushing‚Äôs visage back from the dead for the Star Wars prequel.Likely.  The writing has been flattening to 2D characters and no real plot, when it doesn‚Äôt get offensively preachy and/or profane.Occasionally something breaks through but it is an independent with a small budget made away from Hollywood.With literature dying (what book next to adapt?) and going SJW pink, and the need to vandalize the old stories for their PC reboots, they aren‚Äôt even going to have raw material.

        You know that this is probably the last time you‚Äôll hear of such as this.  From now on all the Harvey Wienstien‚Äôs will have videos of the ‚Äúnasty girls‚Äù like Ashley Judd looking in the camera after having wiped his ass with her tongue and begging for a facial.

        ‚ÄúSoon, the oppressed people of color will be accusing the remaining studio men of being insufficiently remorseful about their ancestors owning slaves.‚Äù
Jim Goad noticed that the modern elite whites lecturing poor whites about racism are descendants of the slave owners.  Here we have an example.  I thought Jews like David were always on the right side of history?  Hmmm, so many of them have blonde hair and blue eyes they‚Äôll have trouble making that case to the hordes. Your skin is unfortunately unchangeable.

        I know I‚Äôm an old codger, for the life of me I cannot see how PewDiePie can have 50 million YouTube viewers. Are younger people‚Äôs lives really that boring and pathetic? i also don‚Äôt believe that the present day music and film offerings are very good. It is wonderful that the old model has been broken, but what passes for self-produced content has not provided any artists that will be remembered in 100 years. I think this is partially due to the fact that these two areas go through cycles and there aren‚Äôt any real great artists breaking new ground that can resonate with the public. But, I also think we are in a shake-down era were the rules have changed, forcing everyone to figure them out and get in on the ground floor for the first bubble expansion. Sort of like the computer and internet boom. They know that if they catch lightning in a bottle they will be the next Jobs and Gates, so everyone is hustling to ride the wave.

            Do you go outside? Read the Internet? Have conversations with other humans? I ask because your post suggests you are visiting earth for the first time or maybe just awoke from a coma.

            Well if you want more profit than what a dollar store turns, you have to target whitey. Same if you want a tip, you better wait on that white table.
Who do you think has income to spare on foam fingers and the desire to pull those? Not Jamal, and you can‚Äôt buy stadium tickets with EBT cards.

                But don‚Äôt look to Prog whitey.  They are well known as lousy tippers and tight with a buck.  Always quick with an excuse why things aren‚Äôt right and so nobody gets a tip.

            Well, we may be delusional, but at least we‚Äôre not accessories to rape or co-conspirators in the cover-up.  If your post is any indication, then pretty much everyone you like, and a lot of people you voted for‚Ä¶ARE.

            People of Color may be the future, but it isn‚Äôt going to be a future that anyone wants to live in, unless those future People of Color learn some of the manners and mores of the old white culture, which is fast slipping away anyway.
