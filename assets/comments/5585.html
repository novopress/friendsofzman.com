        There is another factor that no good leftist/liberal/progressive/whatever will ever acknowledge:
A mass immigration across our southern border of the lower classes of a country which has 4X our murder rate (even without excluding the black component).
It pains me to have to put this that bluntly, but dancing around these two issues when debating the gun control crowd is like fencing with an epee while your opponent is in full armor and swinging a broadsword. You need to be mace-blunt to even get their attention.

        If it look like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck then it is probably a duck. But just to make sure I will examine the ridges on its fingerprints.
If unsure after that, I will declare that duckism is either to blame or that ducks are no different from whales as they both like water and neither can play table-tennis. Problem solved.

        If skin color, hair, and facial features differ, it’s impossible to argue that race isn’t a biological reality. Yet they do.

        One reason for the correlation between violent behavior in black men in sub-Sahara Africa and in America is corrupt progressive culture (rampant in both places).  A traditional religious culture tends to impart morality that inhibits animalistic violence.  Hence, the level of violence among blacks in America was as low as non-blacks before the permissive progressive culture took hold (and religious morality lagged).  Another genetic reason for violent behavior in black men (as compared to whites and asians) is a superior physical stature and an inferior intelligence.  This correlation is very strong, prima facie (without the need of massive social studies).  Taken both together it is no wonder that a tiny minority of black men commit the bulk of the murders in the world (excluding the moslems always at war with “the other”).

        If somebody needs to think that there are no biological differences in the races, fingerprints aren’t going to win them over. Prints aren’t even going to crack my top ten.
