        Maybe the answer is for a right wing government to grease the skids for right wing banking, internet infrastructure, private funding, etc. If there are left wing PPP’s there can be right wing PPP’s.
America is already socially and politically segregated. We can just sever connections totally.
What we really need right now is one racially aware college to get the ball rolling. White Guy Tech.

            Yes. The only answer is to fight fire with fire and do everything they do back to them 10 times harder.
We need to build an alt-swamp, and use it to push out the existing swamp.

        After I heard that a taped conversation between Trump and his lawyer might be used to bring Trump down, I thought, “The Feds are now one or two steps away from just shooting Trump in the back of the head, planting a gun in his hand, and sticking a couple phials of crack in his back pocket.” Actually, black drug dealers get more due process than Trump, since at least they have Ron Kuby and other Jewish mouthpieces to explain why the cartel that cuts off people’s heads is really leading Bible study classes (Vox has an unintentionally hilarious video up on YouTube about how harmless MS-13 is). The Manafort stuff is going nowhere, so now the Deep State is being reduced to dragging out  reality TV contestants and Magician-Libertarian Nonpareil Penn Jillette (cue the Reason clown horn) to tell us Trump should be impeached because he used potty mouth a decade ago. Maybe I shouldn’t knock Penn too hard. He did create Patent #US09005258, the hydro-stimulator add-on for the Jacuzzi, which supposedly helps induce clitoral orgasms in women. I’m sure it will help bring back manufacturing in America if mass-produced, or at least help the #Metoo harpies unwind when they’re not out collecting (yarmulke-covered) scalps, like those of Weinstein, Weiner, Franken, et. al.

            I literally laughed out loud when I heard Tony Podesta had immunity.  That is a real two-fer.  Setting up a Trump guy for jail time while simultaneously giving a Clinton crony dispensation for all his crimes.

        Outstanding analysis, I was partly nodding in agreement, partly going ‘oh yeah, makes sense’ reading it. One Q I had at the end was ‘if we also have a de facto ruling class why do they not have the aristocratic incentive to invest in the country they govern?’ but the answer came quite fast, b/c there’s a reason they are called globalists, they do not see themselves or their interests as tied to any one particular country. Countries are just tools for them. Tools and liquor stores.The analysis of democracy reminded me of the book ‘The God that failed’ by some German guy. I think the problem of short-term incentives to loot the system in a democracy is absolutely true. But why has it, apparently, not happened long ago? America and Britain at least, have had elections for 2 centuries or something. My guess is that this is related to collapse in cultural norms. There was a time, or so I believe, when the term ‘public servant’ was not a joke to either the claimant to the title or to the public.And, an autocratic departure from democracy and elections, ‘to set the country right’, seems like an incredible risk to take. It’s a leap into the unknown, w few controls on what happens then. It’s like jumping from a burning building, hoping you land somewhere soft. But democracy has clearly stopped working, maybe not quite in America (Trump’s election actually proved that American democracy is not dead yet) but certainly in Europe. So, what the hell do we do now???

            I think “The God that Failed” was Raymond Aron (French), who also wrote “The Opium of the Intellectuals” (spoiler: it’s Marxism).  The thing is, “voting” covers a lot of ills.  The Romans still had a Senate, and it was still “voting” on stuff, while Caracalla et al were holding orgies in Imperial purple.  Oswald Spengler got it right — Caesarism is our future.

                    That’s the one.  I was thinking of an anti-Communist book from the Cold War, also called “The God that Failed,” but Raymond Aron’s not in it. Going senile in my old age… sorry, and thanks for the correction.

                    Yes, that’s the one, thanks. But ancap? Doesn’t he basically argue for enlightened absolute monarchy? I think Hoppe’s diagnostics of democracy’s shortcomings is significantly stronger than his proposed prescription. But then again, no one has really proposed a better alternative to democracy that does not involved dumb luck, ie a rational and ultimately benevolent dictator.

                    That’s a book I recommend, even though I think libertarianism is nuts. Hoppe’s materialist analysis of democracy and monarchy is a good primer. He’s wrong about some fundamental things, but that’s libertarianism.

            Hans-Hermann Hoppe. His analysis of democracy is pretty much the standard classical liberal treatment. The Founders had similar opinions. Hoppe takes a materialistic approach, being a libertarian, but the basic ideas are the same. A guy named Alexander Fraser Tyler in the 18th century that republics eventually end in one-man rule, as the self-interest of politicians undermines the principles of the republic.
My favorite way of describing democracy is from Adams, “two wolves and sheep voting for lunch.”

                I just cant think of an alternative system that doesnt rely on dumb luck when picking the dictator. It’s hard to remove a megalomaniac once he’s the unrestrained boss of a secret ‘security’ police etc. Maybe less democracy, ie voting only for married men with property and/or kids, to ensure they have skin in the game, rather than no democracy is better?

                    Most of the leaders are not good at what they do, no matter the system.  The trick is to get a good leader that repairs things and reinvigorates the system before the succession of bad leaders takes the system down.  True for dictatorships and for republics.

                        In my estimation power is ALWAYS the problem. It really doesn’t matter which system you have – it’s the aggregation of power that causes all the issues.  So – whichever system  you choose it should have as it’s focus the prevention of aggregation of power by whatever means possible – for as long as possible.I believe the founders of this country made an attempt at that – and at the bare minimum at least recognized that power aggregation is the fundamental issue.  Since much of my political awareness comes from the perspective of trying to protect my rights to own a firearm:  I think that the 2nd amendment exists as one component of those mechanisms to prevent power aggregation.  All the rest of the Republic’s ORIGINAL political structure also seems to be at least an *attempt* at preventing that power aggregation also.The problem the way I see it – is that the original structure has been tweaked and manipulated and massaged and outright ignored – over and over and over again by those interested in power aggregation.  We’ve now reached the point where the left is just being blatant and out in the open on their quest for power – and making no bones about who is going to suffer once they get it.Seems like an awful lot of people out there are being quite ignorant of this – as well as acting like unicorn fairy tale believers in their quest to find some magical strongman to make it all right for them again.  Lots of people still clicking their heels together and saying “there’s no place like home” – while being living examples of that observation: ” you can’t solve a problem by doing the same things that caused the problem in the first place”.This is why I have absolutely NO faith in all the calls for a magical strongman to make it all right again, calls for monarchy – or any of the rest of the arguments that rely on some version of government power to get the boot off our necks.  As far as I am concerned the ONLY true solution revolves around dialing back government power.  Then the lunatic elites can bitch and moan all they want about deplorables – and we can tell them to fuck off and go back to our business without having to comply with their insane beliefs and all of the resulting edicts.Relying on a top down solution is just asking for more abuse.  That should be clear by now – but apparently it isn’tMaybe the beatings need to continue so the attitude will improve.

            Zman’s analysis in his penultimate para is pure Hoppe.There are several reasons “democracy” used to work better.  Let me just throw out a few of them.  (a) It was operating within highly homogeneous nation-states (old meaning of “nation”, not the empty new meaning).  (b) It sharply limited franchise and officeholding to a low time preference subset of the population with a stake in society.  (c) Being elected to office required intellectual ability, and did not involve endless fundraising.  (d) There were many relics of either the monarchical regime (England) or the original Constitutional design (USG) which limited the state.Note that I scare-quoted “democracy” exactly because all of the things that make it work are opposed to democracy as we know it, namely, that everyone in the world has a vote on everything and all persons and property are de-facto collectively owned.  We still have some imperfections in our democracy, i.e. that non-citizens can’t vote.  But these are being slowly but surely worn down.

                Hoppe’s view of democracy was pretty common in the 17th and 18th century. His materialist gloss is unique to libertarians and Marxists, but both start from the same assumption about human society and human characters, so it is not surprising. Where I think he falls down is *why* democracy is expansive. Still, Hoppe’s treatment of democracy is worth knowing, just for his labeling it “public government.” I think that is a term he coined.

                Leonard, I think you are right about why democracy did better back inthe day. I also think the culture was less superficial and ‘pop’ than today.
Z, agree about libertarians and Marxists having the same materialistic outlook. Libertarians are in a way Marxists who adopted their one-dimensional view of humans but reached a different conclusion. But their initial assumptions are fundamentally over-simplistic.

                Right, right, once the franchise and population become degraded to the point where one has unrelated even mutually hostile groups competing against one another, democracy becomes a low time preference blow out, like Z said.  The final blow is when the currency is degraded, like we have now, and people will be unable to show high time preference even in their lives.

            You missed the biggest public-private partnership in regards to immigration:  the resettlement agencies and “charities” that do the actual dirty work on the ground of dumping Somalians into cities in Maine and Minnesota (to site just two examples).
The reality of “refugee resettlement” (refugee doesn’t even mean anything any more)  – is that there’s a whole bunch of ostensibly “private” agencies taking government money to spread these people all over the country.

                The concept of a “refugee” is temporary in nature. “Resettlement” is a strange buzzword that hides “settle” as in “settler colonialism” which when practiced by white people is hell on earth according to your average shitlib academic. It’s not unreasonable to ask that those “resettled” in this country should return to their homelands when the war is over, we should provide financial incentives for that. I believe it was Mark Krikorian who said that the cost of settling one settler in the US could pay for 12 refugees to stay in the Third World.

                    What I always bring up when some shitlib starts screaming about “refugees” – is :what happened to the camps?When Vietnam fell to the commies – there were Vietnamese who had fled who sat in camps for YEARS.   The Palestinians sat in refugee camps in Lebanon for YEARS.  Refugees used to be an issue that was handled by dumping everybody into camps – not spreading them around the countryside.My understanding is that there is some UN agreement or mandate – that once a population gets labeled as “refugees” – then people get apportioned out to different countries – and we HAVE TO take them.Since the term refugee doesn’t appear to mean a goddam thing any more – this looks to me like some sort of UN enforced “diversity” policy.

                        The Palestinians have a special agreement. As the Arab countries won’t naturalize them, which would consent to Israeli annexation (welfare state); and Israel won’t take them back(Jewish minority), they remain in a state of legal limbo. Their refugee status is also heritable, other refugees UNHCR don’t get this, the UN forces someone to take them. We have to withdraw from the treaty to prevent this, but we could defy the UN without withdrawing at an unknown cost to our diplomacy with the Third World.

                            I read a rumor that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was working with Egyptians, Israelis, Palestinians on a deal that would create a commercial area in Egypt where Palestinians would work and live. If the Palestinians were to get an autonomous region for themselves and leave Israel, sounds like win-win to me. And perhaps Egypt gets proceeds from the new commercial region. Win-win-win.

                Within the last decade or two, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent worked with an international business coalition to develop Migrant Rights, which the UN adopted, among other pro-migrant policies. This allows migrants to go to any comparatively wealthy western country for any reason — for economic opportunities is as valid a reason as fleeing war. The governments of the western countries are obliged to provide shelter and care. This is how the people trafficking was permitted that allowed hordes of Muslims and Africans to flood Europe. The U.S. to a lesser degree, as our borders already have been almost open for the past 50 years. The high commissioner of the UN Human Rights council is a Jordanian arab who enjoys placing Muslim migrants in western refugee resettlement programs funded by the natives’ taxes, such as Joe Biden’s Refugee Resettlement Act of 1980. The natives do not vote on this, nor do we have a say. Most don’t know about it.

                    Highlights fromResolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on 19 September 2016New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrantshttp://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/1“Since earliest times, humanity has been on the move. Some people move in search of new economic opportunities and horizons. Others move to escape armed conflict, poverty, food insecurity, persecution, terrorism, or human rights violations and abuses. Still others do so in response to the adverse effects of climate change, natural disasters (some of which may be linked to climate change), or other environmental factors. Many move, indeed, for a combination of these reasons. We have considered today how the international community should best respond to the growing global phenomenon of large movements of refugees and migrants. …“We acknowledge a shared responsibility to manage large movements of refugees and migrants in a humane, sensitive, compassionate and people-centred manner. We will do so through international cooperation, while recognizing that there are varying capacities and resources to respond to these movements. International cooperation and, in particular, cooperation among countries of origin or nationality, transit and destination, has never been more important; “win-win” cooperation in this area has profound benefits for humanity. Large movements of refugees and migrants must have comprehensive policy support, assistance andprotection, consistent with States’ obligations under international law. We also recall our obligations to fully respect their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we stress their need to live their lives in safety and dignity. We pledge our support to those affected today as well as to those who will be part of future large movements. …“We strongly condemn acts and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against refugees and migrants, and the stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief. Diversity enriches every society and contributes to social cohesion. Demonizing refugees or migrants offends profoundly against the values of dignity and equality for every human being, to which we have committed ourselves. Gathered today at the United Nations, the birthplace and custodian of these universal values, we deplore all manifestations of xenophobia, racial discrimination and intolerance. We will take a range of steps to counter such attitudes and behaviour, in particular with regard to hate crimes, hate speech and racial violence. We welcome the global campaign proposed by the Secretary-General to counter xenophobia and we will implement it in cooperation with the United Nations and all relevant stakeholders, in accordance with international law. The campaign will emphasize, inter alia, direct personal contact between host communities and refugees and migrants and will highlight the positive contributions made by the latter, as well as our common humanity. …“In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we pledged that no one would be left behind. We declared that we wished to see the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society. We said also that we would endeavour to reach the furthest behind first. We reaffirm today our commitments that relate to the specific needs of migrants or refugees. The 2030 Agenda makes clear, inter alia, that we will facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies. The needs of refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants are explicitly recognized. …“We will promote international cooperation on border control and management as an important element of security for States, including issues relating to battling transnational organized crime, terrorism and illicit trade. We will ensure that public officials and law enforcement officers who work in border areas are trained to uphold the human rights of all persons crossing, or seeking to cross, international borders. We will strengthen international border management cooperation, including in relation to training and the exchange of best practices. We will intensify support in this area and help to build capacity as appropriate. We reaffirm that, in line with the principle of non-refoulement, individuals must not be returned at borders.”

        Obama turned the DOJ/FBI (and CIA) into criminal organizations, not merely corrupted. There is an ongoing coup underway, and it does involve foreign assistance, which makes it treason not merely insurrection. This is more like warfare then criminal conspiracy, and is way beyond normal Beltway corruption. Yes, they are now trying to undermine firearm ownership via private party coercion, but there are tens of thousands of small shops across heartland America that will begin covert manufacturing operations the very moment this practice hits critical mass.

        Humans have a predisposition to “grab it while the getting is good.”  Democracy accelerates this predisposition because envious ne’er-do-wells (which is and always will be &gt;51% of the population) will always vote to dispossess the productive classes.  One word that doesn’t get bandied about in a democracy – stewardship.  Good stewards grasp a responsibility to pass something along to the next generation … to make things better than it was.  Better in dignity and character, not just the material stuff.  That can be pulled off in a republic that reserves voting rights to the productive class, but downright impossible in a dimwitted democracy.Then of course there’s the wisdom of Bastiat:  “Government is the great fiction, through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.”

            Re:Then of course there’s the wisdom of Bastiat: “Government is the great fiction, through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.”There’s even a further problem, in that I think if you actually DO try to live off of your own endeavors – and NOT rely on anybody else – in this country you will typically find the hammers of the Gods come down on your ass.There’s a lot of incidents cited on “patriot” type sites about people trying to just live their lives in their own little corner of the world – not really relying on anybody  and what they typically get for their efforts is a shit-ton of harassment.Even just trying to live in mainstream American society – while conciously not trying to avail yourself of sucking at the government tit,  becomes an effort and will cost you more money.  For people with kids – schools are a BIG issue.  If you do not wish to avail yourself of the public schools – then expect to pay for them anyway , while you search for other options.Trying to live like a “legacy American” – has become one big exercise in fighting to get by – while simultaneously paying for your enemy’s attacks against you.Not everybody can stand up to that.  Most people just find going along to get along to be easier – so that’s what they do.I have a buddy whose brother runs a body shop here in MA.  He’s a pretty hard core “conservative” guy.  When Obama ran for President the first time around – his wife and daughters were (typically) – all enamored with the Magic Negro.  He warned them against voting for the guy – but in the end they did anyway.  When they freely admitted to it after election day – he cut off the wife’s spending money – and told the daughter in college he wasn’t going to pay her bills any more. “You think your voting doesn’t have consequences – well it does now – congratulations – I’m not paying for your shit any more” – or a phrase something like that is what I heard he told them.What did he get for his effort? Sleeping on the couch.  That lasted all of about three weeks before he finally relented.Point of this is:  the pressure to give into the poz is EXTREMELY strong , right down to the personal level within families.  It can take a HUGE amount of effort to resist that bullshit.

                    People don’t stay the same.  And like I said:  he has at least one college age daughter.  So we’re talking something like a 20 year relationship. That’s a lot of time for changing.  The guy owns a business – so that’s a lot of time away from home earning a living – for female hamster to be left alone running on it’s wheel and coming up with all sorts of crazy ideas.Having two daughters probably doesn’t help. He’s outnumbered – and the daughters bring home infected brains from school and infect the wife.In my experience it takes quite a bit of energy and insight to run herd on women who are surrounded by leftist leaning friends and society.  I don’t think a lot of men have the energy – or even the insight on how to begin to do it.  What it often comes down to is an incident like I detailed:  where the women go one step too far and the man just can’t take it any more.

            Not that distinct from the majority that has long preferred goods produced by Third World slave labor. It’s bad enough that we have dishonest liberals that claim the only solution to the trade problem is a literal surrender to China, followed by reviving TPP, TiSA and TTIP. But it’s even worse that most of us, including myself and almost everyone reading, behave no differently when it comes to purchasing. The collective action problem.

A quibble about office holders being short-timers. Turtle-man McConnell is currently in his 6th term in the Senate and I believe has already announced he’ll be seeking another term.

        This suggests a tactic for, ummmm, “concerned” citizens.  Vigorously “picketing” tech companies’ infrastructure and especially personnel would put a lot more pressure on the power structure than holding another rally.  Antitrust lawsuits are doomed to fail (how’s Damore’s thing against Google going, by the way?) because lawyers are lawyers, and even if by some miracle a lower court rules our way, some Wise Latina will find a way to rule that in this particular case, penumbras and emanations mean that slavery is freedom.  (Confidential to those who think Civil War 2.0 is just around the corner: Until militia groups start cutting fiber optic cables (and etc.), we’re still in the “writing angry letters to congressmen” stage).

They will. Gab is on the chopping block. Robert Spencer of Jihad watch had his Patreon account cancelled, Youtube won’t host anti-jihad videos.

        Speaking of which, you may want to back up your own site. Apparently WordPress has joined the FAGS.

        Regarding “One of the worst kept secrets in Washington” (by the MIC), see a most timely post, athttps://consortiumnews.com/2018/08/13/too-big-to-fail-russia-gate-one-year-after-VIPS-showed-a-leak-not-a-hack/, where Patrick Lawrence shows how the Obama Admin. plot became “‘TOO *Big* to Fail’: Russia-gate, One Year After VIPS Showed a Leak, Not a Hack”.Key excerpts:“… American discourse has descended to a dangerous level of irrationality. The most ordinary standards of *evidentiary* procedure are forgone. Many of our key institutions— the foreign policy apparatus, the media, key intelligence and law-enforcement agencies, the political leadership— are now extravagantly committed, to a narrative none appears able to control. The risk of *self-inflicted* damage these institutions assume, should the truth of the Russia-gate events emerge— as one day, it surely will— is nearly *incalculable*….… “Might” or “could” or “possibly” becomes “perhaps,” “probably” and “almost certainly,” and then moves on to unqualified fact, in the course of, maybe, several weeks. Now this is how our most basic institutions— not least, agencies of the Justice Department— routinely operate….It is now considered *treasonous*, to question the word of intelligence agencies and the officials who lead them, despite long records of deceit….”

        I pray for a highly articulate president.   A guy who can step up to the microphone…who is, in fact, EAGER to engage.  And just demolish.   We’re lucky enough to have a fairly like-minded guy in Trump, as freaking president.  The biggest megaphone for idea transference in the world.  And he simply can’t speak well.  He’s hamstrung.   I wonder if Steve Bannon could ever be a viable candidate.  I realize all his flaws.   Just hoping for a guy who can speak as well as he does.

            Trump speaks through his actions. And sometimes I wonder if some of his vagueness or incomplete sentences are brought about by him wanting to speak honestly about what’s going on but stopping himself, realizing that he can’t go that far (yet anyway). He knows proper english and is very articulate if you look and listen closely at the better parts of some of his speeches and interviews. But when speaking publicly, it’s become sort of his breezy style, which also includes humor and puffery. And time shows that his claims always prove to be right. He’s a little too nice and I fear he’s not going to crack down and do what it takes to drain the swamp in a long-term corrective way.

                Ursala: ” stopping himself, realizing that he can’t go that far”.  Articulation allows you to go “that far”.  To go into taboo areas because you posses the language to get away with it.  To creatively wend your way around the PC pitfalls and facile “gotcha” moments.
