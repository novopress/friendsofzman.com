        The whole thing is weird. I understand the concept but can’t get beyond the idea that it’s no different than creating a new gold standard where the value is limited because there is a theoretical maximum to the number of coins. It’s as if we knew that there was never going to be more gold than 115 tons. In that world, what is the value of an ounce of gold measured in goods.Its currency as a commodity with the real game being buying the coins in the hope of selling them (in dollars mind you) to a greater fool.Ultimately, a nation state controls money by stating, “you have to pay your taxes in the currency we create”. The U.S. Treasury will never accept Bit Coins as payment for taxes.
