        B. Harrison (a forgotten but interesting president) and the first Roosevelt ushered in the era of ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù Republicanism when it became widely perceived that immense concentrations of private wealth had become a threat to constitutional liberties.  Note that the GOP of that era understood its first duty as protecting the Constitution and the liberties enshrined there, and not to a set of abstract principles.Today, we seem to have inherited the worst of all possible worlds:  the second Roosevelt (the Soviet-inspired ‚ÄúNew Deal‚Äù), Truman (the ‚ÄúWarfare State‚Äù) and Johnson (the ‚ÄúWelfare State‚Äù) created a monstrosity that knows no constitutional limits.  While one of our parties unabashedly represents the interests of that state and its various parasites to the exclusion of all else, our other party represents those so-called ‚Äúprivate‚Äù interests who seek only to curry favor with it ‚Äì in essence, leaches and parasites by another name.  That private wealth, which is at least as immense and concentrated as it was in the 1890‚Äôs, is now allied with the behemoth state in an assault against both middle-class prosperity and the individual conscience, a project in which they are enthusiastically assisted by both political parties.The lesson of the 0bama years, culminating 2016 primary season, is that the facade of the GOP has slipped and the pretense ‚Äì the lip service paid to such things as middle-class well-being, ‚Äúconservative‚Äù values and constitutional liberties ‚Äì has dropped. In a fit of hubris, the GOP and its hangers-on decided this year to make very public the concealed hostility and contempt in which the party has held its base for years.  The base has now returned the favor, and there will be no going back to what was before.

        The dirt people, what james Wilson calls joe public conservatives, have been insulted for too long. You have articulated something they have felt in their gut for a long time. I don‚Äôt think they envy the rich so much as they‚Äôre tired of getting bled from above and below. Their culture and traditions are ridiculed every day. They believe Donald Trump speaks for them. I‚Äôm starting to think he does, literally, e.g. Crooked Hilary, lying Ted, Bill the rapest and much more.

        Just follow the money‚Ä¶it is always where the current tyrants behind it all lurk. That is the seat of tyranny.The human extinction movement is comprised of these components:Liberalism is a philosophy of consolation for Western Civilization as it commits suicide.Under Capitalism, the rich become powerful. Under Socialism, the powerful become rich.Under Socialism, government employees become powerful.Under the State there lies the free shit army and useful dupes, who are the little totalitarians among us.Under these systems, the dirt people eventually revolt, because they are the dirt people, and are the only people who have ever changed anything for their betterment and liberty.

        A lot of the overseas cash owned by US corporations is stuck there because of the high US tax penalty for repatriating it. There is no way to bring home the proceeds from foreign profits without incurring more US tax, even after having already paid foreign taxes.
It is more the American government‚Äôs insatiable lust for tax money than corporate greed that keeps the money offshore.
That said, Zman is absolutely correct about the corrupting effects on governance inherent in wealth concentration.

        Americans are different from other groups:  they do not suffer from envy.  Which is why American socialism is so weak among the 99%.  However, the 1% in DC are, I think, awash with envious folk.  Trump is popular with the 99% because they are not envious of his wealth.  Europeans cannot understand this.  Neither can George Will.

        ‚ÄúWhile paupers change possessionsEach one wishing for what the other has got‚ÄùBob Dylan, Gates of Eden, borrowed from T.S. Elliot.What is wealth? In a free market society it is deferred consumption, capital. The goal of wealth, a fiduciary responsibility, is to grow. How does it grow? By investing in productive enterprises. It grows by producing goods and services that attract consumers. Its success is measured by ‚Äúreturn on capital‚Äù. Those who invest wisely win while others who are not as productive lose. Thus capital, wealth, flows to those who make people happy.The question then becomes who‚Äôs in charge. Is it better to have the largest part in the hands of the one percent, some three million people, who make good use of it or instead in the hands of 535 elected officials in Washington, D.C. who style themselves the Vox Populi? Venezuela is an exemplar of the latter.All governments are, at base, oligarchies. Ya gets ta pick your poison. Do you want the robber barons or the snake oil salesmen?

        ‚ÄúWholesale tax avoidance was not always a conservative principle.‚ÄùYes, it was, and it still is.Perhaps you mistake tax avoidance with tax evasion.If you report your actual income then rely on and accept all of your genuine personal expenses and deductions you are avoiding tax. If you lie about them you are evading tax.Tax avoidance is adherence to the law. Tax evasion is breaking the law. The cash that these corporations have ‚Äústashed overseas‚Äù is tax paid money earned outside the USA on which the corporations do not wish to pay truly absurd US tax rates, as Lorenzo points out. America and Americans have fuck all claim on it unless they are shareholders. If these ‚Äúfat cats‚Äù are robbing anyone, which they are not, they are robbing Germans, French and Brits et al.Jesus you‚Äôll be calling them revanchist, bourgeois, counter-revolutionary, running dog, imperialist, hoarders and wreckers next.A disorganized, populist, wreck of a post.

            You should probably have that reading disability checked out.
Conservatives used to understand that taxes were necessary to the functioning of country. Insider deals so that plutocrats can avoid paying taxes is antithetical to civil society. Libertarians never manage to get this because being a libertarian means having a low IQ.

                And is there no limit? No limit till even you might say that is damn well enough? No limit if Johnson Controls can make $150M/yr more as a foreign co and that $150M/yr can be used to do everything from sell at lower prices, invest more in R&amp;D, research, easier to raise capital for expansion, paying more to key employees of competitors, marketing, etc to beat US owned competitors? Pfizer‚Äôs trying leave expecting to be able to keep $1-2B/yr more by being foreign domiciled, which can be used against competitors.Fred_Z is basically right. Lower corp taxes &amp; the money comes home. Rich Norway just lowered Corp taxes to 22% to encourage investment their to broaden their revenue base beyond oil.We just don‚Äôt tax the rich enough, eh?

                    You‚Äôre are not answering your own questions. If 1,000 control 90% of the assets, is that enough? Can they control 95%? 99% What happens when they do?The problem with Fred_Z is all of his ideas have somewhere embedded in them the words ‚Äúsomething magical happens.‚Äù As in ‚ÄúLower taxes and something magical happens and the super rich stop pillaging the economy.‚Äù As I keep saying, Buckley Conservatives have been trained like poodles to worship the super-rich and global corporations. History shows that it is dangerously destabilizing to allow great concentrations of wealth, which is why the Founders were so strongly opposed to it.Again, free markets cannot exist when a single company controls the market. Self-government cannot exist when a handful of players controls the economy.

                        I‚Äôm going to take a small stab at this. The Founders  elevated Adam Smiths understandings of human nature, pitting ambition vs ambition (in both public and private affairs) to replace the historical method of good vs bad (in defect of other motives). The job of government was to tend to that understanding, not to become the biggest gorilla in the room. Now ambition is Washington, and all roads lead to Rome once again. Pharmaceuticals have a lock on their industry because the 900 billion dollar price tag for new drugs is typical of the regulation which Washington lives for and at the same time which preserves the pharmaceutical monopoly. And so on.Globalist tax avoidance schemes are a different issue. The correct corporate and business tax is zero.

                            I‚Äôve long argued for a zero tax on business. It‚Äôs just a hidden tax on employees and customers.In my view, taxes are primarily to fund government. Ideally, they are transparent and efficient, favoring no groups over another. We live in the real, not the ideal, so taxes will always warp society by altering incentives. There‚Äôs no avoiding it. The question is how to put that thumb on the scale to good use and that means causing the least harm. There‚Äôs no perfect system.That does not address the concentration of wealth, but you can use tax policy to address the problem after the fact. That‚Äôs what happened after the Industrial Revolution. Great fortunes were slowly dissolved and trust busted up. Regulations prevents the sorts of things we see in banking and finance today.I have no issue with rich people. My issue is with oligarchy.

                        The Pareto Principle, 80/20 rule, named after an Italian economist. Long ago Pareto found 80% of the land was owned by 20% of the people &amp; it applied across many countries. It is a power function, not a fixed 80/20, could be 80/30, 80/10 depending upon a parameter. Quick check: 2014: 67% of income to 25% of people. Probably forever, a few have owned the most.Entrenched?Chetty, Hendren, et al: The likelihood a child with parents in the top 1% will be there is 9.6%.Hirschl &amp; Rank: 61 of 100 households will break into the top 20%, 39 of 100 into the top 10%, 5 of 100 into the top 1% for 2yrs or more.Forbes 400 richest %Self-made: 1984: less than 50%; 2014: 69%. The most recent:  9% from poverty vs 7% inherited.Pillaging?Lord, pillage us some more! Per capita sqft of housing is increasing. In my hood, there is constant replacement of old 2-3 BR small houses by new 4-5 BR 2-stories selling for $800K &amp; up, bought by docs, lawyers, ins &amp; investment house workers, professors, a hus/wife K-12 school teachers, etc. Nordhaus complains wage &amp; GDP do not accurately measure as they do not consider quality, quantity &amp; price. Appliances taking 100s of hrs of avg wage work decades ago take much less at current avg wages. ‚ÄúStagnant‚Äù wages do not reflect the vast increase in real, though unmeasured, value of consumption.Few of the Fortune 500 decades ago exist today. Monopolies gone: A&amp;P Groceries, NCR Mech Cash Registers, IBM Mainframes, Kodak film, Microsoft &amp; Apple may yet wither. Gov controls the law, courts, police &amp; the big guns. That is power. They do such as ACA to expand the Company Store in support of their customers, the rich (for a while) guys.I don‚Äôt worship wealth, any person or Corp. But it is gov who can break my door down, lob grenades &amp; shoot me with impunity, not rich guys. Without gov power, the rich can‚Äôt do a damn thing to me.

                            The trouble here is I think you‚Äôre confusing income with wealth. Or, you think I am confusing the two. Sure, top earners are a temporary phenomenon. The heirs of Bill Gates, however, will be rich beyond our imagination long into the future, just as the Kennedy clan has remained in the elite. As labor declines relative to capital, concentrations of capital in the hands of a few is a replay of first century Rome.Now, you want the government to just leave you alone and that‚Äôs fine, as long as the rich guys running the government agree. When they stop agreeing, you‚Äôre screwed. That‚Äôs the reason for avoiding the concentration of wealth we are seeing. Mark Zuckerberg can influence government in ways the voters cannot because he owns Faceberg, colludes with cable companies and news outlets and buys off guys like Erick Erickson. That‚Äôs before he bribes politicians. A billion can buy a lot of clout, which is why we have a disastrous immigration situation. A Handful of rich guys want it that way.There are no perfect answer. Conservatives eschew ideology for that reason. A just government maintains a healthy tension between the claims of authority and the claims of liberty. That‚Äôs going to mean, from time to time, busting up concentrations of wealth and power.

                                Wealth &amp; income are 2 measures with similar analysis. You mention Gates &amp; Kennedy. But globally as opposed to a few:‚ÄúChetty, Hendren, et al: The likelihood a child with parents in the top 1% will be there is 9.6%.‚Äù‚ÄúForbes 400 richest %Self-made: 1984: less than 50%; 2014: 69%. The most recent: 9% from poverty vs 7% inherited.‚ÄùAnother article re some economists I don‚Äôt recall to blame: Most $Billionaires are self made. Vietnam‚Äôs first fem $Billionaire when VietJet goes public. The $Billionaire founder of Spanx couldn‚Äôt get into law school &amp; was turned down for a job as a Disney Character at Disney World. JK Rowling, et al.I admit being on a limb, mostly alone, but it is not the rich bribing the gov, but the gov in the business of harvesting the rich. The gov with its power is in charge, not the 1% whose members change (&amp; grow in numbers with a richer world ‚Äì China, Asia, etc) regardless of Gates. Yes, you can see weaklings trying to earn their stripes up the power chain such as wet nose, Marco Rubio pleading for Rich-aid. But, the real power are those who demand tribute. Such was done by gov to Bill Gates who ignored politics until he ignored warnings to ‚Äúget involved‚Äù &amp; was punished. Similar with Apple who put Gore on its board ‚Äì like an Italian Restaurant putting the God Father‚Äôs nephew on the payroll. Chuck Schumer is a top dog. The Hedge Funds were growing big &amp; only 1 contributed to gov. SO, Schumer held a luncheon in NYC, Jan, 2015 (2014?) telling (warning) them to ‚Äúget involved.‚Äù Roosevelt (as I recall) was asked why he favored BigCo vs small &amp; replied: ‚ÄúWho would you rather pull our wagon, 6 big Ox or 10,000 cats?‚ÄùThe interface of characters &amp; circumstances between gov &amp; the rich is blurry &amp; mutually beneficial. Most blame it on the rich. At its core; however, is the institution &amp; power of the gov, the enabler, the seller. Long ago in a speech, M Friedman said the reason for the complexity of the tax code &amp; the reason the politicians will not simplify it, is that it is a cash cow for them. The Rich don‚Äôt demand such an expensive-to-comply code, but do pay to benefit at the Company Store. The pols create such in their own interest. They cannot create wealth (the takers) &amp; so cultivate the fields for those who can (the makers) &amp; proceed to harvest.It is the tail wagging the dog. Our difference (confusion?) is not wealth vs income, but who ultimately holds the power, gov or rich guys. If you succeed in laying the scythe to the rich, the pols will applaud you with their bounty, and soon enough, plant a new crop for the next harvest.

        I don‚Äôt ‚Äì can‚Äôt actually ‚Äì disagree with any of this, because I simply don‚Äôt know enough yet to draw any firm conclusions. It seems to me, however, that this post points without actually pointing towards an advocacy of the policies of ‚Äúdistributism‚Äù which Ijust learned about. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a very good option either ‚Äì it kind of smells like the plan to make millions by theUnderpants Gnomes.
Nonetheless, an interesting post that makes things more complicated not less.

        This post is an intellectual mess.
The title is inequality.It references a book by Pikety which suggests an implausible wealth concentration formula almost universally dismissed by all economists.It warns that concentrated wealth leads inevitably to tyranny and hopes the readers just nod along.Then it pivots to cash holdings of the some of the most highly esteemed companies of the past decade.Huh?

                And conveniently redefining my argument to mean something other than I specifically said is a bad rhetorical trick. I actually agree with some points and disagree with others.

        And yet the topic of ‚Äúincome inequality‚Äù is essentially nothing but a thinly veiled call for communism. As they see it, any degree of ‚Äúinequality‚Äù is unjust. Therefore, the only just solution is some kind of complete equality, i.e communism (these days the politically correct term is socialism).

        Very good post.  I‚Äôve been calling this new Globalist Reich, neo-feudalism.  All the world‚Äôs power and money is being re-concentrated into the hands of a small elite.  Corporate America has become an enemy of the common good.  Remember when the old line Marxists would rail against big business?  Well to some degree they were right.  This is something to which ‚ÄòConservative, Inc.‚Äô has been blind.
