        Your description of Libertarianism is right on; wish I’d said it.  A hiding place.It’s always seemed like just so much talk, and every political Artful Dodger I know tells me all about their “Libertarian leanings” the way they might describe a taste for certain kinds of dessert.  Political dilettantes they are.  Democrats and Republicans aren’t respectable in my view, but they run the country because they have both shed much of their own blood, sweat and tears, figuratively and literally, to earn a place at the table.Can you imagine a Libertarian taking a bullet for anything he believes in?

        It seems to me that Libertarianism is merely a vapor put off by a well functioning right-wing society. It’s better ideals are but a necessary part of the tension in the balanced flywheel of a healthy  creed. As you say, it is a posture for people who do not wish to undergo rejection by their friends or run against the buzz saw of the universal narrative.
At least they are not a stalking horse for the left. Neocons come to mind.

        An interesting take on this is a book called Arrest-Proof Your Life. He talks about how the criminal justice system perpetuates itself and makes money for groups of constituents by recycling people who commit petty crime and are chronically disorganized.He said that one of the differences between whites and blacks has to do with organization — whites have an old lady to call and bail them out, for example, and more often do drugs at home.In any case, it’s crime, but it’s also understanding that in some of these neighborhoods, some of the people are essentially pre-literate hunter-gatherers. They don’t show up for court not because they are defiant, but because they really don’t think more than a few hours in advance. Things just happen to them, from their own perspective. The cause and effect just ain’t there.

        Like Liberalism, Libertarianism is a cult.  Like Marxism, Libertarianism is excellent as a critique, but is disastrous upon implementation.  Like all cults descended from the original Rousseau cult, Libertarianism fails because its primary existential assumption, that man is born free and good in nature, and enslaved and made evil by civil society, is false.  A serious attempt to realize a Libertarian society will end up looking like Somalia.Of course, there are very few real Libertarians in the world.  Perhaps Murray Rothbard was the only one.  Ayn Rand hated Libertarians.  Von Mises was a kind of Austro-Hungarian aristocrat.  At least he was honest enough to admit that Libertarianism is just a form of Utilitarianism, another fraudulent Rousseau sub cult.  Rothbards attempt to create a natural rights Libertarianism was unwieldy and unworkable.  Most Libertarians are just pretentious drug users, criminals, sexual deviants, and people with authority issues trying to justify their petty tyrannous impulses with a faux ideology.

        Actually, most folks in local jails are for driving while suspended. (I did notice one guy in jail for two months for illegally sleeping in a park.) In fact, the jail roster can be pretty entertaining.What happens typically is this, someone does something stupid driving a car. They can work off the fine but usually can’t get themselves to do it without driving there. They get popped again for driving while suspended, more fines tacked on, repeat until they decide you should spend time in jail.  If you are a young stupid kid, you are more likely to get trapped in this. And yes, it sucks that people with money can pay the same fine and get out of it.

        Make no mistake, not ALL folks, “calling” themselves Libertarian, or even libertarian,1. Know, or adhere to, what that actually means.SEE: “Card carrying” members of the American Communist Party, community “activists”, (anything)(hyphen)Libertarians, rent-seekers.2. Are.SEE: RINO, NIMBY, “Neo”(hyphen) something-or-other, and again, rent-seekers.3. Have outgrown a “hipster” (by any other name) stage in adolescence*, DESPITE attaining the age of emancipation, OR been required to demonstrate a minimum IQ of 85.(Let alone 100)SEE: *Up to age 26 for “adult children” of “health insurance” “policy” holders.IOW, just like folks who align with EITHER contemporary “popular” party, there’s folks with philosophy, reason, and then there’s adult diapers.
