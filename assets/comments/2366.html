        As a kid I worked the trades in the summers starting as a general laborer for Brown &amp; Root and ending as an Electrician. It paid for my college…
My “rich kid nephews” couldn’t make a week as a surveyor’s helper.
It is quite sad.

        It’s the unions. There was a time when you could get an apprenticeship and work your way into the union. My husband had one with the machinists union, when nuclear power plants were built. Now, you have to be related to someone to get in, especially with the plumbers and electricians.
You probably were watching a union job. The old guys had lost their original jobs and were at the top of the hire list due to seniority. That’s why they were working.

            Teri, I did not think about the union angle. This is a closed shop state so they most likely were union. I’ve done work at the ports, which have strong old school unions. The hire halls look like God’s waiting room.

        In 1831 Tocqueville identified Americans as the most educated people on earth, where almost no one was highly educated, but where the population was literate and applied it’s education to the early and continuous experience  of work. This formed what Tocqueville described as a Cartesian America, rational and practical, where he often heard understandings from ordinary people which had never occurred to the the aristocrats of Europe.Now it has become illegal for young people to work, and illegal for them not to be subjected to the numbing process of “education” to where even raw potential has been sucked out of them.

            Now it has become illegal for young people to work, and illegal for them not to be subjected to the numbing process of “education” to where even raw potential has been sucked out of them.When I was a young man, I was put to work at 14, as soon as the law allowed at the time. I hated it at first, but getting treated as a man (because I had a job) made a huge difference in my outlook. By the time I was 16 and driving, I enjoyed working as much as I enjoyed school, maybe more so. All of the bits of wisdom, usually the result of bad decisions, that the men would tell me, turned out to be as valuable as what I learned in school. I did not get it at the time, but looking back I consider myself very lucky. A lot of my peers missed this bit of learning.

        Looks like you found some great job opportunities for all those liberated feminists who think they can do everything a man can do…and do it better.
Where I live, the dry wall segment of the building trades is dominated by Mexican laborers, probably most of them illegal. They do know their stuff, their prices are affordable, and they are typically willing to remove the old asbestos ceilings that used to be so common in home and office construction, while ignoring the expensive health protections that OSHA rules require for asbestos removal.

        I do my best.I’m “that guy” that can fix “stuff”, all kinds of “stuff”. Oh sure, when the nice widow lady next door needs a new door to her basement (oh…custom made, old New England of course) I’ll just take care of it.When the young (under 40) folks cry “Will you fix it?”, I generally say “NO!, But YOU will!”, and TRY to guide them through it.SOME, are simply hopeless, with ZERO apparent mechanical or analytic skills. I start charging the THIRD time.I blame allegedly well intentioned laws, “For the safety of the children…” that have been put in place by folks interested in “educating”, and “nurturing” everyone else’s children.
