        More to the point, Leftism, in the economic sphere, is offering solutions to problems, such as the overgrowth of trusts and monopolies, or the progressive immiseration of the masses, which either never existed at all, or which were last seen in the Victorian Era.

        Brilliant. Bravo. I have referred to the current age as the Dark Ages. What is commonly called the Dark Ages, as you say, is something of a misnomer.

        […] I was listening to something the other day and the guy talking made a point about public attitudes toward homosexuals. His point was that attitudes have changed quickly. He said something along the lines that just a few years ago homosexuals were treated as bad as blacks in the south during segregation. The implication being that just last week we maintained separate accommodations for the homos. I just laughed as I’m used to the Progressive Timeline. […]

        On another topic, Lincolnian that I am, I take offense at the notion that Lincoln would be a Democrat today, and I’ve explained why he wouldn’t be.

        Thank you for this insightful commentary.One of the (many) odd things about the climate debate is this: only during a period about 20-25 years long, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s or early 2000s, have CO2 atmospheric concentration and global mean surface temperature been observed to go up together. At all other times, when CO2 has gone up, temperature has not.To those not laboring under preconceived notions, this 20-25 year period can be perceived to be a coincidence.But not to the CO2’ers: that 25-year period was when the CO2 mania really took hold among the scientists, academics, and politicians. And nothing that happened before, and nothing that’s happened since, can shake them out of their certain conviction that CO2 determines temperature above all other factors.Though there has been no statistically significant trend in global mean surface temperature in the 21st Century, to the faithful, it’s still the 1990s.

        Another example of how time stands still for Progressives is the matter of sex education in schools.  I’m 55, and I remember sitting through sex ed in the 5th grade.  And mine was hardly the pioneer class; it had been offered in schools for quite a few years before.  Yet Progressives never tire of advocating for sex education as if it were a daringly brand new idea.  They talk as if kids today are being brought up dangerously ignorant of their bodies, like Carrie.  Yet if you think about it, anyone Carrie’s age today is being raised by parents who themselves experienced sex education in school.  (Unless they’re immigrants from some benighted foreign land, but THAT is never suggested.)  Whatever the problems young people are having with sex today, sex education in school can’t be the solution, or it would have been solved decades ago.  Yet this never deters Progressives from insisting that sex ed somehow holds the key, and it’s only the ignorant, religious parents (who somehow made their way from 1950 to the present through a time portal) who are standing in the way of well-adjusted sexual happiness for all.

            When I was a grade schooler in the ’40s, I learned about sex the old fashioned way – standing on the corner under the street light at night listening to the older guys talk. Sixty years married and six successful kids later, it has served me well.

Progressive education must be doing unexpected wonders. High school inmates would rather stink than enter the shower, they don’t want to be seen around mobs of other naked kids.

            Twenty years ago I had a debate with a moonbat friend over sex ed. I pointed out to him that we had been teaching sex ed for fifty years. In that time all the measures went the wrong way. He refused to believe we were teaching sex ed in schools at the time had been doing so for decades.
Just the other day, the same moonbat said something to the effect that we needed to add sex ed to the school curriculum.

        I am not making this up. I was at a party with some Hollywood technical types once.  There were a couple of women there from the creative side as well.  One of them was holding forth on the evil of the Boy Scouts (this was around ’99, a few years before the anti-Scouting campaign hit the big time… which supports the contention I’ve seen here and elsewhere that these IO campaigns are disseminated and honed internal to the cult for years before they launch in the media).  She said she had a Boy Scout handbook from the 15th century and how it said that masturbation was bad and how evil and ignorant and wrong it was to ever even write such a thing.  I had already been conditioned to not challenge a cult member when they were speaking the revealed truth, so I instead asked how the handbook could be from the 15th century when Scouting was founded around 1910.  She looked at me with a mixture of disgust and pity, rolled her eyes and said, “Duh, its the 15th edition.”  I replied with, “Well I guess Jesus must have used the first edition when he was a Scout.”  I didn’t lose my friends (not cult members) but I didn’t get invited to any more of their parties.Off topic, but scrolling through the social mediums today, and while my conservative friends were observing a stunned silence over teh ghey marriage, my liberal friends’ posts seemed to fall in three general categories:• “Bwaa ha, ha.  We’re coming for you next, you filthy, evil christianists!  Yes you!”• The “victory lap” with multiple postings of rainbow flags, photos of the White House lit up in rainbow colors, and (there seems to be an app online that will do this) pictures of themselves in rainbow colors.• “Why yes comrade, I have always supported the workers and peasants soviets and the All Union Communist (Bolshevik) Party.”Just some intel based on a not insignificant, but not statistically sound sample.

        When teaching a class once I mentioned that I can recall seeing my first ad for a ‘home computer’ which, IIRC, has a staggering 1mb of memory and required hooking up to the TV to show that you could repeat a word (in black and white) multiple times across the screen if you got the BASIC coding rightMy students were both appalled and fascinated. How did those dark days exist before computers? they wanted to know. How did you meet people without the interwebz to assist? What on earth did you do for entertainment?And what about the lolz, hey!?I have to admit I couldn’t recall. It was such long time ago I had no idea how I met my wife or contacted friends, or how I learned things, had no idea how I passed the time. But then it was such dark period how could I know?

            We tend to suppress those unpleasant memories of the time spent foraging for nuts and berries. When we weren’t cowering in the undergrowth, hiding from the dinosaurs. At least we had it better than our parents. Nobody should have to walk to school in 5 foot snow drifts, uphill.Both ways!

        I’ll give Marley some props, he had a decent grasp of reality.  As for our progressive Moonbats, their brains have been so seriously warped by an indoctrinating education system that they can barely tell time as the above piece shows.  Very soon the SHTF and these poor uneducated souls will be the first to fall victim to the peril that is coming to us from outside the country.  70+ people were killed today and no one cared who or what they wanted to sleep with.  these killers only cared about the fact that they were not muslim and are daily emboldened by the ineptitude of western leadership.  its gonna be a long hot summer

        Bob Marley said it best : If you know your history, then you would know where you coming from. The problem is that people today don’t know their history, thanks to the Leftist control of education. Conservatives understood this far too late.
