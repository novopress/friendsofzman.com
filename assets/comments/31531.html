        Hey Z-Man,
I wanted to bring to your attention the “Traders were told of Hamas attack on Israel in advance and ‘profited from tragic events’, researchers claim” news item featured on some media.
Don’t think anything more than “lol” can be the comment.

        The DC panic is palpable.  They tried this bizarre strategy of trying to hide $61B in Ukraine funding inside an “immigration enforcement” bill.  Then they tried to say MAGA voters would be mad at Trump if the “immigration enforcement” bill didn’t pass.  That just nuts.  Completely nuts.  NOBODY believed that bill was anything other than an attempt to legalize illegals.  You don’t need a new law when you refuse to follow all the other laws.  There are no MAGA voters fooled by this.  99.9% of them WANTED the bill killed because they knew is was a damn dirty lie.Then it became clear that it really was yet another Ukraine ruse to restart the money laundering machine.So now they’re trying to force reps to vote for it by telling them they can’t have Taiwan or Israel money unless they approve Ukraine money.  But that approach was DOA when McCarthy got thrown out for pushing it.Plus the fact that the average American’s reaction to the Middle East dust up is, “Another f$$cking war?  AYFKM?!”  So it’s not like Israel is feeling the love.The Government Party in this country deserves to be bitch slapped, and it looks increasingly like that is exactly what is coming.  They’re incapable of performing two of the most basic duties of government: defending the country from invasion and not looting the treasury for personal profit.

            Trying to blame the border on Trump and co is standard satanic Marxist projection and inversion.
It does appear that at least some more sheeple are beginning to catch wise to the ‘kraine laundering scheme, why is why Senator Six Ways to Sunday’s (D-Tel Aviv) lame threat about ‘merican troopz in Europastan fell on deaf ears.

So none of them get $$$.  Sounds like a win-win-win to me.

        The Reformation was the result of an institution that had evolved down a dead end because it evolved for a world that was beginning to recede. The social and economic relations that made the Church possible were giving way to new social and economic relations, so a new moral order rose up to challenge the old moral orderThat’s not an explanation but just the usual darwinian pattern adapted to history.The awesome Christian civilisation (aka “middle ages”, aka “dark ages”) collapsed because people started to follow the pathway of falseness instead of the pathway of rightness.The theory (which can be denied, but has very strong logic) is as follow : a) God exists. b) Jesus is the one true God. c) the Church founded by saint Peter is the one true Church. d) if this is true, the Scriptures are a serious thing. e) there are rules which, because God is good, are a pathway for the construction of a faithful, happy, harmonious and prosperous.That was the theory.Consequently with that theory, if people chose to follow the pathway of falseness, society will become more and more unharmonious, unhappy, unprosperous, and more and more immoral.And more and more stupid. (which is totally logical : the more you follow false ideas, the more you lost your mind, in the same way as you will be lost while driving if you follow a false map). And I think everyone here would agree than our world become more and more stupid (and more and more despotic).Why wokism increase? Why feminism, leftism, budget deficit, military spend, obesity, tattoos, abortion, etc. increase ?That wasn’t the result of a plot made by some evil guys in a crypt. That’s dechristianisation. And the US are the headquarter of that movement. Hard to believe, considering the huge amount of hard believers that country have. Yes. But, if I continue to follow the theory written above, that’s still coherent : according to that theory, protestantism is false. Consequently, protestantism is disarmed and can’t fight back the Error.Once again, everyone may think that this theory is false, but no one can deny that it isconsistent

            Can you expand a bit more on the Protestantism is false idea?I’ve been studying some Christian history, via some Orthodox writers.Is it mostly the Sola Scriptura point allowing for each man to interpret as he sees fit and to accommodate how he chooses to live?Isn’t their fault though in the men of the ecumenical decision-making?  In the end they become a bit of Pharisees themselves?Happy to be corrected and/or educated.Thank You

                You didn’t ask me, but put it this way: when my parents bought our first PC, they came with thick technical manuals, and I read those manuals so I could do more than point and click. The engineers who designed the thing wrote those manuals, or at least somebody who got it from the source. Maybe I was a heretic for figuring out how to overclock the thing lol.
Sorry, feeling defensive!

                    To carry your analogy further, the programmers who wrote the software to work with the PC wrote specific code to do specific things.  If you “re-interpret” the code and insist on typing commands your own way, the software is not gonna work (or at least not do what the programmers programmed it to do).  You can write a new software program (Luther 2.0), but then it may not work with the hardware or you may get wonky results.

                        Software is a different ballgame. That’s where idealism comes into play. All I had to do was switch a jumper on the motherboard.
Point being, the foundation of my knowledge was ‘maker’s knowledge.’Otoh, I’m dubious of, say, genetic engineering, because God didn’t write a biology textbook. We should be much more careful when we don’t know what we don’t know.

                I think if we look at the history of Protestantism, northern European protestant societies thrived very well for a long while, such as England, and the earlier United States, and German states.  They had that civilisational confidence that Kenneth Clark described, which was so valuable.The “dechristianisation” which Colbert mentions is also key, although I’m not willing to condemn Protestantism as much.  I’m also not anti-Catholic, and I hate to see what has happened to the Catholic Church since Vatican II.  I  see a lot of good in what Protestants were able to accomplish, until all churches, Catholic, Protestant and otherwise, started succumbing to the world more and more.

                The issues with Protestantism from a Catholic perspective are pretty simple:1. If you want a religion that is built around a book written by a prophet, well that religion is Islam. It is not Christianity. Jesus entrusted his church to a man, who then set up the line of succession from which the Catholic Church derives its authority. Protestantism intentionally and purposefully breaks that line, and so the question becomes where does it derive its authority from?2. If it is a personal interpretation of the Bible, then any interpretation is as valid as any other. If that’s the case, then you would just get hundreds of different religions that all have slightly different interpretations of this and that – and that’s exactly what happened. And it is one reason why after about 500 years, Protestantism has completely run out of steam in Europe and America and has collapsed as a religious and moral authority for the flock.

                Can you expand a bit more on the Protestantism is false idea?The problem with the protestant reformation is that it set in motion a train of events that led to the point we are at today.One of Martin Luther’s opponents in the 16th century stated that the logical end point of the reformation was that everyman would have his own church.  Which may have seamed an argument absurdum at the time – but has come to pass.   From there it is just a short jump to everman being his own god – which is the end state o liberalism – that we are also enjoying today.

            Rephrasing you a bit, but what you’re describing is “incoherence”.  The Church of Rome grew increasingly incoherent.  The name Protestant literally flows from Protest.  Martin Luther wasn’t trying to start a new Christian sect.  He was protesting the incoherence.  (selling of indulgences, for example)The Church has had two maybe three waves of incoherence since St John Paul II:– the sex abuse scandals which they clearly covered up (fueled by gay priests)– banning people from church during COVID and implementing anti-Christian “mandates” – if you REALLY believe what that man hanging on a cross stands for, you have no need of a single covid mandate.– Pope Benedict’s love of communists and gaysThere’s only so much incoherence an institution can take before it implodes.That’s where America, and the West in general, is today.  Their climate change predictions never come to pass.  Too much snow, not enough snow, and average snow all signal the end times.  The whole tranny thing is just nutty.  You can’t turn lead into gold.  Immigration cultural suicide.  Flat out lies re: COVID and elections.As that incoherence accelerates things get worse.–

                The problems you discuss can be summed up in one word, “Americanism”, known to the Church over 100 years ago but unfortunately fully embraced and adopted by the Church post-Vatican 2 through the tremendous influence of the future Pope Benedict XVI. It’s a huge mistake and unfortunately something the Church needs to deal with (they tried 100 years ago, but failed obviously), but if history is any indication it will. For better or worse, it has survived worse.

                You forget the Church also survived Arianism.  The errors you speak of are human errors due to the existence of human beings in the Church.  Yes, it sucks.  Yes, Luther may have had somewhat of a point withabuseof indulgences, but then he went much farther off the rails himself (sola scriptura, once saved, etc.).Point is, these errors we will always have with us popping up their ugly heads from time to time.  The Church’s divine institution is a guard and guaranty against these errorsovercomingher, but that doesn’t mean she won’t get infected and ill from time to time.  Just like with our own immune system, she can get ill and look and feel like sheet for while, but eventually bounces back.

            The reformation was “caused” by a papal power grab – the Gregorian revolution – in the 11th century – which resulted in the supremacy of the church over secular rulers.  At least in theory,And the establishment of an entrenched self aware church bureaucracy.That revolution was so successful that moderns just assume that the result had always been the case.  But it was not.Along with power came corruption.  Almost immediately.  With reform after reform effort being violently suppressed by the catholic power structure.  Each suppression just led to a larger and more violent attempt at reform.  Until finally the Protestant reformation succeeded. Followed eventually by the return of secular power to civil authorities un the Catholic sphere over a period of centuriesBy the time we got to the reformation, unfortunately, the reformist had been moved to the point of throwing out the baby with the bath water.  In this case, undermining the moral authority of the church entirely, not just rolling back the papal power grab.

        Aside from the suffering of Ukrainians, I don’t sense much danger in this Ukraine situation, for whatever reason. The closest I came was at the beginning, before Russian dominance was established. Russian restraint in the face of Western goading and bluster— I’m glad it apparently wasn’t taken as weakness.Idk, I’m not sure what’s going on. If this is WWIII, the West is militarily gelded, and the coup de grace is financial, why not end it? I notice this sliding scale of the dollar. Used to be the unquestioned standard, then said it was propped up at gunpoint— clearly no longer the case. Now, supposedly, there’s no better option. Can’t imagine there are many excuses left.I kind of think there has to be some serious horse trading going on behind the scenes. People in the know have to know we get that New World Order everybody’s been talking about for a long time— just not the one that was predicted.

        Where are all the wonder weapons of the West that were supposed to turn the face of battle? I thought Russian engineering was supposed to be shit. Instead, so many Bradleys are burning that Ukrainians are calling it “Bradley Park.”Putin has played a marvelous game of not involving the common citizens of the capital, Moscow, in his war and keeping the Russian economy going in the face of sanctions from the West. He is truly a skilled player. When Trump comes in office, look to a total collapse of the Ukrainian defense and Trump to take credit for “peace.”[To read more of my stuff, click on my name up above with your mouse]

            You aren’t wrong but we aren’t Russians here. Putin is only useful to us insofar as he seems to be an enemy of the fifth column that currently illegitimately rules over us and poisons the culture of our people. I down voted you as well.

            Agreed.  If Trump has learned anything, upon inauguration, he will partner with Putin for peace—and will be lauded for such statesmanship!  If he is the dope (and hidden neocon) folks here decry, he will shove money at the Uke’s and pick up the fight where a Biden left off.  At that point, I will post an apology to the comment section for wasting so much of their time with Trump support.

            I agree with you but couldn’t help but notice how amusing formal logic can be sometimes:
If X is a fool then you can’t convince X that he is a fool.
The logicaly equivalent contrapositive statement is:
If you can can convince X that he is a fool then he is not a fool.

            “You cannot convince a fool that he is a fool because he IS a fool.”
That’s funny. It reminds me of my college days when a buddy and I cooked up “aphorisms” that we would quote, deadpan, sometimes in their “original” Spanish or Italian. One I still treasure is “a fool is he who shoest his horse in the rain.” All of our “aphorisms” were like that; vaguely poetic, utterly meaningless, but above all, a fool test.*
*Said in Italian with a decent accent, to an “earnest” female undergrad in the Humanities, desired results are known to follow.

            we installed Zelenski and the other puppets there with a color revolution and maintained them with NGO’s . For the specific purpose of starting this war. we had them unleash the AZOF paramilitaries on the ethnic russians in the donbass to provoke russia . the UN says thhat 14000 civilians were killed in the donbass from 2014 to 2020. When that didn’t do it we had them start the process of joining NATO so that we could put our nuke on the russian border , 3 minutes flight time to moscow.  That finaly forced putins hand.  He foolishly thought once ukraine saw he was serious they would relent …. and here we are . zelenski announced that the was going to start talks with russia on a solution after 6 months of fightinh . Boris Johnson showed up i  Kiev the very next weekent to “consult”  with him .   Whhen he left on monday, selenski came out and announced Ukraine would fight untill they gained the entire donbass back And Crimea , and russia agreed to reperations. Now nknown as the fight to the last ukrainian .  The level of evil here on our part is off the charts . most likely the real numbers including civilians is close to a million killed and 2 to 3 million maimed and crippled in Ukraine engineered by the Kegan/Nuland clan at the behest of some nefarious group who oversee them .

        It’s definitely become clear that Russia (and China) now view themselves to be in a long-term cold war against the US. Ukraine is just one aspect of this multi-decade struggle, which is one of the reasons why Russia is taking it slow.The real battle will be on trade/global finance front. That’s where the US very much still holds the upper hand and where it’s difficult to see how to defeat it. This is why I’d suspect that Russians and Chinese don’t want to provoke (be provoked) by the US. They’re playing a very long game.The neocons, OTOH, never seem to think one step ahead. To them, everything can be solved by a color revolution and US missiles.I suspect that the neocons are going to get increasingly frustrated in this cold war against the East. Like the parasites that they are, their only real skill is infiltrating a society and then using their skills to corrupt from within. If the Chinese keep them out of their society and Putin keeps his own neocons on a leash, our neocons will discover that they have no power of them – except, of course, the dollar.Basically, it’s all about the dollar as the global reserve currency and treasuries as the global reserve asset. That’s the neocon’s last real weapon. If that is even diminished, it’s over for GAE.

We now have the American Dilemma: do we bomb Iran today? Or wait for the election…?I am sure the libs and Donks will have a Current Thing ready to go.

        OT:
“Rep. Tom McClintock said on Tuesday that he will oppose impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas… argued that the GOP articles against Mayorkas stretched how the founders would define an impeachable offense.

MIGHT use against them in the FUTURE?  WTF?  How about have repeatedly used in the past, present, and triply into the future.
So fake and gay.  grillers still blabbering about “muh constitution/founders” and honorable/reciprocal behavior while dems a hairs breath from completely holocausting them.

                The point is to tie them up/defame them at every turn or opportunity.  Dems don’t hesitate even if it won’t lead to a direct victory.  For them, it’s bloodsport.  For grillers, they’re just uniparty beatiful losers/washington generals.

            When I used to live in CA, McClintock was the best conservative representative in the state, by far.  He used to go on local talk radio and explain the principled constitutional conservative view.  I liked him a lot and donated to him multiple times even though I didn’t live in his district.
Over the last year or so, his name keeps showing up in votes that stymie MAGA.  What happened?  Did he visit Epstein’s island?  Or maybe his constituency has turned decisively liberal and he’s trying to keep his job.  He used to seem like a sincerely principled guy.

        As long as King Dollar remains on his throne the GAE is not defeated. Other than how it would mark the end of Ukraine as a political entity, there cannot really be any such thing as a Russian military victory in Ukraine, since that does not end the conflict between Russia and the GAE, it merely moves the line on the map farther west. The Russians seem to be aware of this truth, which is part of why there does not appear to be more urgency on their part to win this “military victory.” They are aware that in such a situation they will not really have won anything. Which buys, or has bought, time for the GAE. There’s no indication that the GAE knows what to do with this time, there’s not much indication that the GAE knows what to do at all. It’s sort of like WW3 kicked off, yet everybody on all sides realized they aren’t prepared to fight it. Sitzkrieg, this was called in another time. Which in Ukraine proper is a poor name for it, as lots of people really are dying there. The thousand Ukrainians lost per day figure seems accurate. At that rate one has a hard time picturing this current state of affairs lasting very long into 2025. By which point the GAE will be required to up the ante in some way if it wishes to stay in the game.

            GAE wants an escalation.  Just like they want their own citizens to escalate, so they can say “see we told you they were terrible people, bring on the camps!”  Why give your enemy what they want?  GAE is doing a splendid job falling apart on its own efforts, just grab some popcorn and bide your time.  The difference between clever and wisdom.

            Ha, I said basically the same thing in my comment. The Russians and Chinese understand that they are now in a long war involving multiple fronts – military, global finance, tech and culture. I don’t think that the neocons fully understand this. They seem to be very short-term thinkers.But the lynchpin is the dollar as the GRC and treasuries as the global reserve asset (GRA). For the foreseeable future, there’s no alternative to the dollar. Treasuries, however, are another matter.The world needs dollars and treasuries were the best way to ensure actual dollars when needed as Eurodollars recede in a crisis. The question is can another asset be used to reliably access Eurodollars in a crisis? I don’t know, but I’d suspect that lots of people are trying to figure that out.

                What is amazing is that we seem to have found a way to have world war without blowing up the world, despite the existence of nukes. But maybe it’s just the cold war template. Two nuclear powers do not shoot at each others’ men (in uniform, “advisors” are fair game)
Cyber attacks are also “permitted” according to empirical evidence.
We’ll see about targeted airborne viruses. That could be the bridge too far if there are any finger prints
Will we reach year 2100 without a nuke fired in combat?? Seems doubtful

        Here in Germany, the schizophrenia re Ukraine has been of the charts since January. 50% of news coverage says “Russians are too incompetent to win in Ukraine”, while the other half argues “Get ready for war now, Ivan will be in Berlin soon.” Funny thing is: You can read both versions in the same newspaper on the same day.The “Prepare to fight” propaganda is of course a hoax. Governments in western Europe are well aware that a third or so of young and youngish men are getting more and more right wing by the day. Another third is Muslims, ie Palestine sympathizers, ie antisemites. That makes two thirds of the relevant demographic to whom governments will NEVER EVER give guns.The last third of 20 to 40 year olds is so degraded that a conscription army made up of them would be like the Sacred Band of Thebes where you throw out the fighting and keep only the butt stuff.

                The EU has been pushing to de-nationalize Europe for decades. Because being nationalistic and proud of your country is too right-wing for their taste.This is why when you see a German flag being displayed, it means it’s because it’s football season and we’re in the World Cup.But now, we’re all supposed to rally around the flag because Putin is evidently planning to once again to roll into Berlin like a repeat performance of May 1945.German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has echoed the opinion of British General Sir Patrick Sanders who said “The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a sign of things to come.” Pistorius is now warning us that we should prepare for “…decades of confrontation with Russia”. And that we must quickly rebuild the country’s military “in case Vladimir Putin does not plan to stop at the border with Ukraine”.Germany ended conscription in 2011, however it’s now back up for debate. Pistorius commented, “There were reasons at the time to suspend compulsory military service. In retrospect, however, it was a mistake,”As of October 2023, Germany has around 181,300 soldiers in its ranks (all services), well short of it’s target of 203,000 it would like to have by 2025.As usual, Germany’s leadership has perfect 20-20 vision in hindsight; a significant lack of trained and technically capable personnel, military hardware that’s no longer fit for purpose. And due to unstable energy prices, and lack of cheap gas from…Russia…numerous international corporations are putting their investment plans on hold. Or worse, they are building new production capacities abroad.All of which means Germany will be hard pressed to fund or support the military they believe we need in order deal with the looming threat in the East.

                    And no doubt, Germany will have to fight a war in “green” mode – ie., solar/wind powered vehicles along with bows, arrows and swords.  They wouldn’t want to be accused of worsening “climate change”.  As a matter of fact, it’s hard to believe the greenies and letze generation are even allowing a discussion of possible war – just think of all the evil and toxic emissions.

                It’ll work just fine. It already is.The defining feature of the warrior caste is obedience to whoever claims power over them. *Submission* gives them permission to “pass it on” and, e.g., murder defenseless women. The men Mark Zuckerberg sends out to Ruby Ridge your family for posting 2028’s equivalent of Let’s Go Brandon on Facebook will look like Patriot Front. Some will be the same guys.The trannies, soys, and living antisemitic caricatures are for giving “unconstitutional” orders. They have a special enthusiasm for it. The imported forces, Muslims/etc. in Europe and Mexicans/etc. in America, are for street-level terror—from deadly riots to stinking up Walmart—not military ops. They don’t need orders, just propaganda and physical access.It’s a finely judged strategy.

            I am still incredulous that Germany, and others in Europe, do not seem to understand that the U.S. government committed an act of war on your country when  they destroyed the Nord Stream Pipeline.
If a real leader ever gets elected in Germany they would immediately tell the U.S. not to let the screen door hit their backside.

                Answer from Germany – I get the sense that a vast majority here are very much aware of what happened to Nordstream. Among that majority, 20% say so openly, 80% don’t. The latter, which includes government and media, have a species of battered wive syndrome vis a vis the current US administration.  A good example is the current defense minister, Boris Pistorius, who has been mentioned in this thread. If some Washington person told Boris to put on a trans outfit, he would only hesitate to ask if pink or purple looks more flattering.Long way to say: Our ruling class had an extreme case of Trump derangement syndrome. So when Biden came in, they suspended all scepticism, self interest or rational thought in favor of blind obedience. Of course, the fact their god Biden is a vegetable gives them severe cognitive dissonance.

                The relation of most Germans, indeed most Europeans to the US is that of a battered spouse to their partner: “He only hits me when I’ve done something wrong. I know he loves me.”Like the battered spouse telling everyone she fell down the stairs or walked into a door to explain away her black eye, Germany prefer not to speak about Nordstream, and if you insist they’ll either claim the Ukraine did it or tell you they’re better off without the pipeline anyway. Or if they’re completely delusional they will claim that Putin bombed his own pipeline, the one he could have closed down by turning a wheel. The one he has a standing offer to send gas through the remaining pipe.It’s a very sorry state of affairs and speaks to the utter disspirited psyche of the Germans after 75 years of occupation and reeducation. The only ones with some spirit left are the East Germans, who lately feel a very sinister familiarity with speeches from politicians and articles in newspapers.I concur that Germany will not play a significant role in any coming war, not even as an industrial powerhouse, because you need energy for industrial production. The ruling coalition will face mouting unrest and discontent, and the only way they know to react to this is by ramping up the authoritarianism, which will of course feed back into the discontent. It’s going to be one down-hill slide to the next federal elections in 2025, and I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they hadn’t planned on giving the people a chance to throw the out of office anyway.

            Perhaps they are thinking of ancient Greece where the warrior caste was known for occasional butt stuff. As usual, they miss the context. Those guys out on campaign far from their women had an excuse at least. There’s an element of the usual bugman monomania too or what Z calls TORAH (there’s only one right answer). So we eliminate everything masculine and honorable and martial and keep the butt stuff. In fact, we make our military about nothing but butt stuff (pun intended).

        I just read an article by some neocon General in Britain.  He says that the West must station long range missiles in Poland and Finland and raise a NATO force to enter Ukraine.    The article was launched from one of the neocon controlled publications.
I bet this man’s insanity drips from him.    Does he know what Russian artillery has done to Ukraine?    Is that what people in Finland and Sweden really want?

                Speaking of the WEF and NGOs in general, it’s imperative that any nation that wants to remain sovereign recognize that virtually all NGOs (including a lot of “Christian” charities) are the infrastructure of the long-desired World Government that the 20th century intellectuals dreamed of. These groups must be utterly eradicated root and branch. Right now, they don’t have an army. They need to be stopped before they get one.

        The Russians clearly need to slow the tempo and reduce the destruction inside the Ukraine in order to prolong the destruction that is being wrought inside the EU and to a lesser extent the US.Ukraine is now just a theater in what has become a much larger struggle between the occupied zombie West and much of the rest of the planet.Look at what is happening inside Ukraine’s great ally Poland: the newly installed globohomo Tusk is already facing a crisis because Polish farmers are blocking roads as part of a protest targeting, among other things, the aformentioned Ukranian ag products.

            Exactly this. A limited, protracted war in Ukraine is absolutely in Russia’s strategic interests. This war is driving a wedge between Europe and the US, consuming Western stocks of ammunition required to support NATO’s ability to wage defensive war, and forging stronger bonds between BRICs nations. Putin has no reason to end this war.

        “Instead he posts pics of himself with the leader of the ultra-nationalist faction.”
What, exactly is an “ultra-nationalist?”  Usually when I see this term, it’s being used by a regime toady describing anyone who doesn’t want full on open borders.  Usually somebody who loves their country and doesn’t want to sell it out to the highest bidder or flood it with hostile foreigners.
Maybe the “Banderite?”  I hear Stepan Bandera was a very, very bad man with ties to an even badder bad man.

            Strange how a Jew (albeit claiming conversion) runs the country.  Ukrainians welcomed NAZI’s in WWII with flowers and flags as they went through the villages toward Moscow.  One could understand their hatred of Communists, however Ukrainians were instrumental in Jew roundup, executions, and played a significant role as camp guards.
My suspicion is that Putin will never eliminate Ukrainian “fascists”, but I don’t deny he truly sees them as a problem.

            Galicia has produced an amazing number of lunatics, Bandera being one of them. Most of the neocons trace the family tree to that area. Lots of communists and anarchists came from that area. Lenin learned a lot from his time there working with Jewish communists.
As far as the ultras in Ukraine, if they loved their country they would never have supported this madness.

                When I was young and loved my country, I supported the US Sandbox Wars.The Russians invaded The Ukraine.  In the east, they were treated as liberators.  In the west, Ukrainians rallied to their flag.If not for the misplaced Ukrainian love of their nation (and malignant foreign interference), a modus vivendi would have been reached.

                The only thing I know about Bandera is the Nazi collaboration and the fighting the soviets after the war.The Nazi collaboration sounds quite reasonable to me given the circumstances. Do you fight for a fake empire that deliberately starved millions of your people and imprisoned  millions more to deadly “hard labor” or do you take your chances with the army who just wiped out Western Europe’s militaries including France?As for the current situation, I’m not sure how they could have prevented or stopped it once it started.Frankly, I’m pretty ignorant of Eastern Europe and Russia and especially this war. I was more commenting on the term.

                “As far as the ultras in Ukraine, if they loved their country they would never have supported this madness.”This x10,000. What kind of sad-sack dumb-ass retarded-elf excuse for a neo-Nazi cuts a deal with the International Jew and thinks that they are not going to get screwed in the end? The original Nazis hang their zombie heads in sympathetic shame.This is yet another example of how nationalists, driven by the imperative to defend their people, allow themselves to be hoodwinked into serving transnational groups through their own ignorance, venality, and corruption. Ironically enough, it was the former-boxer Jew mayor of Kiev Vitaly Klitschko (who just bought a $6 million mansion in Hamburg, Germany) who publicly commented once that if the people of the Donbass didn’t want to be part of Ukraine then Ukraine should just let them go. If only Ukro-Nazis had the common sense of a brain-addled boxer.Klitschko didn’t get it then, that it was never about ‘democracy’ but (for the local Jewish oligarchs) about the massive resources under the Donbass and (for the International Jews) about attacking Russia to get at all the rest of the resources of the Russians. I have no doubt his lack of understanding of the bigger picture was why Victoria Nuland dismissed him from the short list for consideration for appointment (via fake democracy) to senior executive leadership in her famous intercepted conference call in 2015.

                    “Jew mayor of Kiev Vitaly Klitschko”
He’s Christian.  There is an article about him Baptizing his Children in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and his defense of Alexander Usik, who was accused of being pro-Russian for being a member.
So as best I can tell, he’s not a Jew.
Also, he is not brain-addled.

                        https://www.jpost.com/international/article-700968Note that it is only the Orthodox who obsess over the arbitrary minutiae of traditional lineage. Most see shared blood as shared blood. Unlike the Sephardi or Mizrahi who are pretty much genetically the same as the North African or Middle Eastern populations from whence they come, the Ashkenazi are a hybrid people, with ~50% European admixture.However, that it a population estimate. It varies greatly among individuals. So, at some point it comes down to a choice. He chose to become part of the ruling class of what essentially is Neo-Khazaria, where those with power and wealth were overwhelmingly Jews and the ruled were overwhelmingly not. (example: 6 of 7 pre-war Ukrainian oligarchs are Jewish) I put him in the same category as the lawyer/bankster Lagarde or the shameful excuse for a diplomat Albright: enough to be in the outer circle but not enough to be in the inner circle.My point in ‘brain-addled’ was not to imply that he is stupid, but that in spite of whatever damage he may have incurred during his first career, he is still way smarter than any neo-Nazi. He is going to be living in luxury in Hamburg soon, after all, while the neo-Nazis are going to be hunted to extinction.

        An excellent and concise summary of events in the SMO. Now go deeper.The Russians know that this doesn’t end with the defeat of Ukraine. They have been trying to engage the West in a negotiation for a new European security arrangement since at least 2007 and have been thwarted by neocons at every step. This leaves only one alternative, which is to facilitate the collapse of Western hegemony, which is a much bigger task.The slow-roll war has now largely disarmed NATO and the USA of munitions, AD, armor, and artillery. Worse, it has exposed them as paper tigers. Germany, the linchpin of EU economies, is now de-industrializing and US productivity has been revealed as a mirage. Add in ongoing and unfettered invasion by 3rd World mercenaries and the pressure cooker is primed to explode.Most Westerners are now too soft to either recognize what is coming or robust enough to survive the collapse, so the Soma of voting harder is an effective distraction. But we don’t have to degenerate into chaotic self-slaughter like Ukraine. We can choose a better path that focuses on the root of the problem, and thereby bounce back much quicker and with far less horror. The pathogens must go. That is how Mother Nature has handled this problem for about a billion years.

                It’s possible, but the near-misses that are turning ships back are being made with old kit. If the Russians start getting involved in earnest, then they will provide modern missiles, which will hit and sink. If Globohomo does not back off, soon or later that is going to happen.

        Obviously Biden’s people are happy to try to blame the upcoming “failure in Ukraine” on the “MAGA people” refusing more aid. The problem is that the public DGAF and is only focused on the border and rampant inflation. This is the fatal error of assuming a Beltway issue resonates in actual America.Meanwhile, Putin is content to grind the Ukes all year and wait to see if Trump wins. He has no incentive to negotiate now, even if he did trust Biden’s people, which he doesn’t.Our wiseass Deep State forgets that War changes the participants. Russia is not the same country as it was at the beginning of the SMO, Putin isn’t the same man and Russians aren’t the same people. The longer it goes, the higher the stakes. The Deep State modus operandi of ruining one client state and moving on to the next objective is now facing a major challenge against an implacable, nuclear-armed foe facing an existential cultural, political and military challenge.

            I think this war was in the planning once Putin assumed power and revealed himself to be a Russian nationalist rather than a corrupt, kleptocratic, manipulable joke like Yeltsin. McCain pushed for it hard for nigh-on twenty years. If he’d won the presidency in 2008 we’d probably be talking in hushed tones about the “American Stalingrad” now, amid the ruins of our own bombed-out cities.

        The US used to be much better at overthrowing governments and installing puppet regimes.
The competency crisis rears its head again.
(Make no mistake, the US is still pretty good at it, as long as they can play the fox. Poland, Ireland, soon Hungary…it’s impossible for an open society to resist the rainbow dido.  It would appear only closed societies can repel it with naked, brute force. )

            It’s largely a case of other nations wising up. The playbook isn’t complicated, and just involves expelling foreign agitators and their money.
The reason it’s hard to fight is wiping out NGO’s and foreign groups makes it look like undemocratic repression that will lead to a NATO bombing. Now enough people know the game to the point where NATO can’t just bomb them all.

                There have been proposals wrt changing balloting and counting.  We’ve all heard of rank order voting (Australia does this I believe), but also there have been serious proposals to mandate “None of the above” as a choice and if it prevailed, then all candidates would be rejected, not be allowed to run again for the is office, and a new slate of candidates selected.  The biggest drawback seems to be the possibility of no winner in time to take office.  But it’s been a long time since I followed the discussion.

            You have admire the mulish obtuseness of Dickless Cheney’s campaign:“We have not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada. We made the decision early on that we were not going to pay $55,000 to a Trump entity to participate in a process that is rigged for Trump.”So, you plan to beat your most powerful opponent by refusing to take part in the only process that could win you delegates. And after getting primary votes elsewhere by using crossover voters from *the other party,* you want to moan about a rigged process?A whore will always be a whore, whether she spreads her legs for some guys in S.C. or Boeing.

        Figured when there was not a “Mannerheim moment” within the first 3-6 months that this was going to turn into a geopolitical balance altering conflict.  There is also an odd rule of thumb that once you kill off 3% or better of a population in a war, shit gets really different in the aftermath.  Looks like we’re past that threshold for the Ukes, which I expect to effectively “end” as a country.

            A year ago or so Putin gave a speech in which he said something along the lines of it was never the intention of Russian to destroy Ukraine. It was an odd thing to say at the time as the Russians were still mobilizing to fight the war and preparing for the big Ukrainian attack. In retrospect, it suggest the Russians were thinking about what comes after the war. I suspect the Russians have at least one version where Ukraine no longer exists as a country.

                I suspect if Russia is forced to occupy Kiev, then all bets are off wrt the future of Ukraine as a sovereign entity.  That speech of Putin pretty much outlined the—then—current goals of protecting the majority Russian ethnic provinces from the genocidic laws passed by the Zelenskyy government.  There was the possibility of peace and reconciliation at that time.

                    There is a good chance that factions in Ukraine reach out to Russia for support to overthrow Kiev. I would not be shocked if Zaluzhny stages a coup with support from the ultras, then cuts a deal with the Russians that includes handing over the ultras. A pro-Russian government is then setup that signs a deal with Russia to hand over land, dismantle the military and eradicate the nationalists.

                        The Russians conducted a brutal war with the Chechens. The extremists were eliminated by military means, and the surviving Chechens decided they had made a mistake and made a deal with the Russians. They retained local control in exchange for fealty to Mother Russia. It’s possible this will be the end result in Ukraine. But first the globalist scum sacrificing Ukrainian men and Ukraine’s future must be eliminated or driven from the area.

        Perhaps there will be an explicit effort to cut off funds for Ukraine, but I’ll believe it when I see it.  The tards in charge for sure will funding the juice war in the Middle East, so maybe they’ll figure out a way to funnel some of those dollars surreptitiously to the ukies.  Of course that would also have to include figuring out how to get the juice to part with those funds once they’ve got them in their greasy hands.  The US government can’t be gotten rid of soon enough.

            Priorities.
Didn’t the US break open its stock of artillery shells tasked only for WWIII and stored in Israel to send to Ukraine, then literally re-re direct them back to Israel post October 7?
The Sampson Option is a nice name for nuclear blackmail, but deadly serious.
7 million people holding enough nukes to severely f up Russia, Europe, the Middle East, and a few choice US cities is pretty wild.
Masada is a huge part of the Israeli psyche and can’t be underestimated.

                The US would certainly not stop that. That could be misconstrued as anti semitic after all. So if it came to that it would probably have to be up to the Russian navy.
Mu softer side still can’t believe Israel would do that. But believing is one thing. I wouldn’t mind learning that the Russians have state of the art anti sub capabilities. In case my belief was misplaced

                Exactly.  We’ve basically eaten our “seed corn”.  There simply is nothing to be had out of reserves if I read correctly.  Now it becomes detrimental to our military readiness.  On the other hand, if we stop making tweaking China, Iran, and Russia’s nose, there are not too many enemies on the horizon.

            I do not think so. The neocons who run foreign policy for the empire believe their theories. They really did think Russia would collapse once American wonder weapons hit the ground.

                    Russia had been under sanctions at least from 2014.  That only served to make them stronger and more independent.  Russians never had that much of an affluent “Western” lifestyle to begin with—and therefore to lose.  They also have a huge amount of natural resources—as does the USA—so you can’t strangle them—even if you could halt all external trade.  Those who think their economy is on the verge of collapse are just useful idiots for the Neocons.

Exactly. If you are serious about hurting Russia’s economy, and you really do believe that they are just “a gas station masquerading as a country”, then a serious economic strategy would be to develop U.S. and allied domestic energy production to the max to flood global markets with cheap oil and natural gas. The fact that they pursued the opposite strategy shows they are not actually serious about weakening Russia’s economy.

You may well be correct.
I guess that twixt the two options, I’d prefer they were merely avaricious, corrupt and uncaring, rather than so impossibly dense and cult-soaked that they actually believed they could defeat Russia in a land war. With Russia located adjacent to the theatre.
Hey wait, I know!  Perhaps they are BOTH greedy and stoopid?

                    They counted on winning the war against Russia through the economic sanctions and ousting of Russia from the monetary-financial system they run and control entirely while making sure it’s named, and seen as “international”.
The idea, or expectation, wasn’t really all that silly — it’s a strategy that mostly never fails them.

                Hubris will undo them in time. They are too megalomaniacal to change course now. The NYT is pleading, but fifth column wisdom falls on deaf ears when you have full control of the west. We are cattle, remember. Sin Chickens. They have the same problem as we do, smart ones are not breeding because of cultural rot. It’s Jonestown for all of us… unfortunate, but we do have the numbers to outlast them in the long term.

The Grift was secondary.
The primary motivation was for the glory of Mother Khazaria [aka Lilith].

        I do not want a collapse. We don’t want to live through that. Though, I suppose you could make a good argument we are living through a collapse meets a planned demolition.I do hope that the empire taking another stinging loss creates opportunities for our cause. Things would be difficult but manageable, but throwing The Great Replacement – Stage 3 – Mass Invasion and Subsidized Settlement onto it is just a total catastrophe.Trump better win and he better get some of the White Papers folks on board to help with his mass forced and self deportation plan. Otherwise this thing is finished.This thing is already finished. It is a matter of what position we are in to start something new with more salvage to build upon.The dumpster fire rages. May the death toll on both sides of this brother war be minimal from here on out.

            Collapse aside, the best/quickest thing a Trump in office could do is to “sour the milk”!  Turn off the “goodies” spigot and offer return tickets for all (IA’s) that have arrived.  This will be infinitely easier than to track down all these now entrenched illegals, then grabbing them in front of MSM cameras while they regale us with sob stories.

                Look, Trump is incapable of doing anything.If Trump poses a threat in any meaningful way, the left will going into survival mode and look for any weakness to bring him down.They have an easy out to wreck his presidency on day one.  All they have to do is call up their media toadies and tell them to change the narrative on the vaccine deaths.There will be instant riots that Trump will be unable to contain due to his own involvement in signing off on the Warp Speed program.The fools on the right should have found another candidate that didn’t have this hanging over his head

                    Can’t agree.  Your logic would dictate that they’ve *not* yet thrown everything at eliminating Trump.  They have and he’s with stood it all.  Vaccine shenanigans began under Trump, yes, but became fully manifested under Biden.  Trump can plausibly say he’d never have allowed the program to continue once early reports came out from VAER’s.  As to support, the Rep field has tried and failed.  Trump—flawed as he is—is the only Rep that has a chance of election.Trump is the face of populist anger.  It’s Trump or nothing for the GOP.  As for the Dem’s, they might try physically eliminating Trump as a last option, but even this window is closing.  Once Trump selects a VP, then he has a logical successor grabbing the anger and sympathy of the post-Trump voter.

                        Robbo, no disagreement there.  But on the other hand, the same is said basically *for* Trump—he is the only one who can/could pull the nation together—assuming he’s learned enough from his mistakes—given his following.  He has anti-elite cred’s.

                How many continuing resoultions did trump sign without a single $ for his wal? several, each time saying “This is the last time I will do this” . Trump can do nothing . If he were real, he would have shut it all down untill he got the wall. but he wouldn’t .  When people complained to him about being deplatformed , he mockingly said ” we are watching the situation carfully” . I would vote for him again to spite the omniparty, but I am realistic that he can do nothing .

            Trumps deportation claim made me laugh out loud. Yes he should and could and must but no, he won’t. No chance. Locating and deporting this vast number of people requires consciencious and persistent work. The mouth that roared.I’ll believe that when he appoints O’Bannon chief of staff, and that aint happening.

His fiction books are great and he’s been a guest on Red Ice a few times.  His last visit was a great show a few months ago.  He’s got another book coming out soon.

        The establishment obviously wants to maintain a stalemate until after the election.  But it looks like they’ll run out of Ukrainians first.  The smart play would be to negotiate a settlement now and hope people forget.  But they aren’t smart as d have no reverse gear, so this will become a debacle in a few months.

        Whatever happens in Ukraine will likely play no role in the 2024 elections. Maybe the Democrats will need to try a little harder to create enough votes for Biden but that is about it.Americans have never really cared about international events. I grew up during the Vietnam War and it was depressing seeing how little people cared unless they had a kid in the military. Even young draft age kids didn’t care until it became fashionable to be against the War around 1970.Hysterical women will care about the Ukraine if they are told by the rulers to care about it but that is about all.Traditionally people have voted their pocketbook. Our replacements still do that but Good whites mainly vote for what they feel makes them look and feel good. See what the nyt and others are caring about and that is what they do vote on.My guess that the nyt will tell people to vote to stop climate change, systemic racism, attacks on transsexuals and who knows what else.The right will likely mainly vote domestic and will be energized by the border and the Crack down on conservatives. Whether they have anyone to view for is the next issue.The other big issue will be Trump. Will democrat men be as hysterical as in 2020? The women of course will be because they will be told to be hysterical. What happens if Trump is jailed? That alone will be a bigger issue than Ukraine.

        Another issue is what the inevitable Ukrainian collapse will mean for Europe and the European Union, which recently blackmailed and strong-armed Hungary into agreeing to a 50€ billion aid package for Ukraine.  Ukraine’s collapse ought to lead to a crisis of legitimacy for European institutions, but I fear it will lead to a “the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming” hysteria that will clamp down even more on dissident views.  For example, a dissident website named Riposte Laique was recently raided by the French police and there is serious talk in Germany about outright banning the increasingly popular Alternatif fur Deutschland political party.  Best not even to mention the UK, where saying something like “It”s okay to be white” can get you a prison term for hate speech.

                    Normal Ukrainians *almost* took the right the lesson from Soviet occupation. They’re not anti-communists, anti-imperialists, etc., and they have no reason to be. What oppressed them wasn’t ideology but people.Their error, greatly amplified by recent Western propaganda, has been to identify those people as Russians—specifically as *ordinary* Russians, gopniks/vatniks, the ones who “support Putin” (remain Russian and resist Westernization), the kind of poor bastards who get press-ganged into a trench. It’s proven a *very* deadly error that might see their people erased from the earth (as perhaps it’s been designed to do).Now the Poles and Finns are looking over the Ukrainians’ shoulder, copying their suicide note. It’s astounding to see.

            A primary American objective was to divorce Europe from Russia. That has been achieved short term. Over the long haul, it will fail. While the West has become semi-totalitarian, it was only able to do so due to the unprecedented prosperity. Once that goes, and it seems likely maybe as soon as this year or next, governments will teeter. Since NATO is little more than a United States-led Warsaw Pact at this juncture, it almost certainly will be deployed to quell civil unrest. The self-immolation of the state propaganda organs will make it difficult to pull off a repeat of the Gdansk shipyards since Westerners, particularly Americans, now know their governments are monstrous, pathological liars. These governments already operate via raw force and that is not a successfully strategy for an extended period of time.This is the most deranged type of foolishness imaginable, and it doesn’t even have the excuse of economic necessity (yet). Putting insane people in leadership positions ultimately is suicidal.

            Diversity Heretic,I expect that the hysteria over the “approaching Russians” will gradually ramp up. Never mind that accurate information about this Mickey Mouse conflict is hard to come by. Never mind thatexactlywhat is said publicly by The Ivans is subject to (mis)translation. Never mind that nobody really knows Ivan’s thoughts.Now, I’m an armchair general as much as the next man, but that would seem to make me qualified in this day and age to offer my worthless opinion. Austrian Painter (AP) had, by the last quarter of 1940, taken over most of mainland Western Europe (and therefore unhindered access to The Atlantic and English Channel). AP had at his disposal not only a large fighting force, but some of the toughest and finest units in the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS. Even had “The Battle of Britain” turned out to favour AP, invasion of the British Isles was still have been a formidable and costly undertaking.Ivan has none of these things. How, exactly, would Ivan conduct his “imminent invasion” of The Isles, after marching his army across the continent through all those hostile countries? What naval and air might could Ivan level at The Isles?As you can see from my crude and amateur analysis, there doesn’t seem to be any fear of an invasion. Guess they could nuke us, though.

        The Ukraine situation, like the border, is the fault of all democrat voters. From the Trump presidency, if he had true support, we could have had the wall and deals. Instead, from the uterus head march, to the russia gate lies, the fatass Ukrainian vindman impeachment, to blm, hunter cencorship and voter fraud, war was declared from democrat voters. It’s their fault for all problems. They should be looked at as enemy combatants and when the empire loses, treat them,including shitlib family members, as such. Because they already declared war on you in 2016 and supported genocide in ukraine and at home.

        The SMO actually worked. The Ukrainians and Russians negotiated a deal in Istanbul in March 2022 that would have implemented the Minsk agreements: Russia gets to keep Crimea; Donbas stays in Ukraine but with some limited autonomy.
At that point, the US and UK intervened, sent Johnson to Kiev to squelch the deal, which he did. After that the real war began. The next negotiation will be the terms of surrender for Ukraine.

            It took the Russians a long time to internalize what happened in the spring of 2022. It will be interesting to see if Putin talks about this in the Tucker interview. Putin has talked about this at length with non-Western media. The triggering event was when Merkel came out and said the Minsk agreements were a fraud to trick the Russians. That is when Russia reorganized for a long war with the West. Curiously, there has been no signs in the West that they now see this as a long war.

                Former French president François Hollande also confirmed that there was never any intention of implementing the Minsk Accords; they were a ploy to buy time for Ukraine to be armed to the teeth against Russia.  Like you, I think this was and will be a very big factor in Vladimir Putin’s attitude towards peace negotiations with Ukraine.

                The French author Emmanuel Todd has released a best seller in France called the Death of the West.  It is only available in French but there is a good review by Scott McConnell here.
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/french-best-seller-u-s-is-a-nihilist-empire/
He discusses the Russia-Ukraine war and that the Russians are prepared for a long war.  He notes the failure of sanctions, the rejection of LGBTQ agenda by the whole world other than the US and EU and how hollow outsourcing has made the West’s military.  The wheels come off the GAE in 2027.

                    Exactly, we are filled to the brim with expats with questionable loyalty. One line of my family hails from the America revolution while the other half I’m technically 3rd generation from the 1880 to 1920 European wave. Talking to the 1st and 2nd gen on that side and they still talk about some damn discrimination and talk lovingly of the crappy country that was abandoned. Who is this new elite feel thw same way towards their so called countrymen and have an emotional, false attachment to the dump they left. Honestly, I am glad the 1924 act restricted more of that mindset from infesting the country that I am loyal too. If only shifty dem voters could be sidelined to shut down this other invasion.

                        Yes, PJB wrote “The Death of the West.”  Mike has the title slightly off for this one.  It’s called “La Défaite de L’Occident” (The Defeat of the West)

                        Sorry about that.  The title is The Defeat of the West.  I read PJB book and confused the two.

                    The article raises another point which I have made here on several occasions. The US no longer has the human capital in terms of engineering capacity to increase production of armaments.The US (and the West in general) does not graduate sufficient numbers of engineers to design and build the machinery and factories required to produce armaments, much less the armaments themselves. Further, US engineering programs have tilted significantly toward electrical and computer engineering programs in response to the silicon economy, but we need more mechanical, civil, and chemical engineers for armaments industries.There is no path forward for tooling up conventional armaments in a rapid fashion. This will take a generation or more.

                “ …there has been no signs in the West that they now see this as a long war.”
That’s because we are a hollowed out, “paper tiger”.  About this time, 2 years into WWII, we were producing more war materials than the rest of the allies combined.  Liberty ships rolling off the docks and songs sung about the proverbial “Rosie the Riveter”.
We were not only a serious country, but had the manufacturing base to back it up.  Now we are as fake and gay as the rest.
