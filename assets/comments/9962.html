        Dalrymple’s statement is spot on. If the government can force us to redefine the most fundamental facts about humanity, they can force us to believe anything they tell us to believe. This most ridiculous argument is simply for the purpose of them telling us what we will believe and what we will be forced to accept. If we can be forced to believe that our mother is a man and our father is a woman what can we be expected not to believe.  The fact that is so obviously wrong is the essence of the argument. I will tell you what you will believe and you will accept it – period.

        Had Bruce Jenner won not gold but bronze, would he be Caitlyn today? This is a question that I frequently pose to acquaintances of the Left. The moment of silence is the answer, and puts lie to the notion that yesterday’s besotted gynophiliacs (today’s transgender heroes) were tragically placed in the wrong body. The psychopathy appears to require an element of  external stimulus.

            Nice insight. I bet he wouldn’t have even divorced his first wife, because he’d still have been dependent on her.

            Yes. He wouldn’t have been able to achieve the fullness of his attention whoring but he’d still be a tranny. I didn’t know much in 1976 but I knew the first time I heard him speak that he was way off, and the off wasn’t even a faggy off. Now we know. The closet gets a lot of undeserved lack of respect. Respect the closet.

                I was too young to know much about Bruce Jenner beyond what could be gleaned from an open cereal box. The absence of such public proclamations of “otherness” not so long ago (within my short lifetime as an adult) is today attributed by the new, improved Left to “oppression;” that “society” actively suppressed such specific behavior (and actively oppressed its agents). But this is not convincing. More reasonably it could be argued that what today we term oppression , an action requiring agents conscious of their actions, was then simply a lack of agency on the part of society: the lack of an epistemological framework to model such human behaviour as normal and provide it sanctioned outlets of expression. In other words it was analogous to arguments today regarding racism: it manifests itself in an ether of “privilege” unrecognized by its carriers (whites). This it is argued that racism is worse than ever because it is not an active act of agency but rather because its agents are passive and unaware of their privilege. In this context, society historically oppressed the transgendered by lacking knowledge of their existence (an apparent epistemic failure limiting the definition of sex to the “merely” binary and biological), and thus not providing outlet for their expression. But if society had robbed you of the ability to realize that you were what you did not know you were, you naturally seek other outlets to define yourself within existing parameters. And thus, returning to our hero, I believe it most probable that if Jenner had not medaled, or achieved only the obscurity that is the Bronze, his available avenues to sustenance and self realization would have been limited to the far more mundane and structured life of a high school gym teacher (he graduated with a degree in Physical Education from a little known university. He came from a life of pleasant obscurity and would have returned to the same. Would his gynophilia have expressed itself in any case? Maybe. But I’m not so sure.

                    What?  That’s a lot of mumbo jumbo to get to “maybe”.
Plain and simple english does a better job of getting to the point, in my opinion.

        “That’s the lesson from this story about a good, progressive mother of small children, having to stand silently as a burly man, claiming to be a women, uses the lady’s room at Disneyland.”
Fifty-odd comments, and nobody has identified the most important lesson from this little story: Stop patronizing Disney in every way. Disconnect your cable TV. Don’t pay money to watch their movies. Don’t go to their amusement parks. Don’t buy their books. And most importantly, tell everyone you know not to, either.

        Rather rare for a (biological) women to attempt to compete ”mano-a-mano” in men’s sports.The ones that come to mind are:http://voxday.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-battle-of-sexes-was-fixed.htmlhttp://voxday.blogspot.com/search?q=Ronda+RouseyAnd the Jets tryout of a woman as a kicker:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPLT2luUpyIAll of them ridiculous.On the ”tranny in the Disneyland bathroom” story, many commenters at Vox Populi pointed out that the story failed to mention the race:I’m like, “WTF? Ok there is definitely a very large, burly man in a Lakers jersey who just walked in here. Am I the only one seeing this?”And read ”large, burly man in a Lakers jersey” as African and she refused to confront it because of that. I don’t doubt it, and as long as Disney continues to ‘virtue signal’ in this regard, they will open themselves to a lawsuit when the inevitable happens and a (biological) man rapes a woman or even worse, a little girl in the ”women’s” restroom. Worse yet for Disney is their long-standing policy of their theme park complexes being effectively ”a municipality unto itself” (literally in the case of the Disney World resort). IOW, there are only Disney ”Security Hosts” (their term) to intervene in such a situation. On-duty, uniformed cops are usually barred from their properties.

        A lovely post, perfectly accurate. This mess has happened before, of course, and will happen again.‘When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “Stick to the Devil you know.”On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life(Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “The Wages of Sin is Death.”In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “If you don’t work you die.”‘

        “there must be order. Even the madness of North Korea beats anarchy, where it is a war of all against all.”
The more government we have, the less order. We will soon be having our war of all against all. It’s government coercion that will kick it off, not anarchy.

        Why would a man want to use the women’s toilet anyway? If you have ever been to the football, any music festival or even the local park on a busy weekend, there is a line 20 metres long stretching out of the women’s lav with women patiently standing cross-legged looking across at the nearly empty men’s toilets. Drunk women regularly burst into the men’s toilets at night clubs to use the cubicles dodging the line up next door.

                Actually we had to use (years ago) photography.Now we can use ”selfies” to video ourselves. But it’s still awkward.BTW, drinking blood is overrated, it really is not appealing (blood really does not taste good). It’s not unlike a opiate addiction.And drinking blood from someone with opiates is quite risky. Vampires can OD from opiates.

I posted this at Althouse recently, it sums up what is going on, humorously.
It is great the black actor saying “don’t you put that evil on me” considering white guilt and slavery in America.
Of course McKay the director and the stars are First Order Progs and the culture wasn’t as far gone in the slightly under two decades since the characters and scenes were created, so I credit the accidental truths exposed as unintentional, brought about by the fog of comedic intentions and workings.

        Men-in-the-Ladies-Room is just a skirmish in the larger battle for the future of the species. Industrialization wrought affluence, affluence wrought parasitism, and modern politics made it into a vicious cycle. The two sides in the current dimorphism are the productive at one extreme and the pathologically dependent at the other extreme. This bimodal distribution will continue to separate as the species cleaves into two main archetypes; self-reliant workaholics and loudly-whining parasites. The only effective survival strategy for the latter group is to exert control over the former via tyranny. Nothing will be resolved until the battle becomes unambiguously existential.

        Well Zman you called it when you coined the term and defined the dirt people.That is what I think.I wrote these two pieces in tribute, and because of your insights and for us dirt people. They are not up to your fine standards, but then, I’m invisible and it’s difficult to define in words too.
(The second is a outlier of left handed logic, it popped into my head after something you said about being invisible, which you have conveyed a few times, but in not so many words.)

        “The Progs have total control so all of their worst instincts are free to run riot. It’s not some new phase in the long civil war, but the final burst of maniacal lunacy before there is the knock on the door and reality bursts in.”We saw so much of this in the run-up to the election that I think they assumed that they were on the homestretch. The ascension of Mr. Trump has reset the whole game. This is one of the main reasons for the frantic attempts to discredit, if not overthrow him. As I watched this, two passages from scripture came to mind:Matthew 10:26: Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.Matthew 10:27: What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.andPsalms 92:7:When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:The fact that the pedo / black magick scandal came out right before the election seems absolutely miraculous to me. I had become convinced that these things were going on from my reading. The corroboration was still a shock, but to see it made public when it did was an even bigger one. Deus Vult.Phil

        There’s *something* to blank-slatism, though.  I’ve been a deep cover shitlord in academia for quite a while now, and people who claim to believe this stuff really DO seem to believe it, despite acting like the decadent children of privilege they so obviously are.  Psych 101 suggests severe cognitive dissonance*, but I’ve never seen it.  I have never, not once, ever, seen a prof remotely bothered by his 1% lifestyle.  Nor has anyone ever given me a cynical wink or a sly smile about putting one over on the rubes, even though everyone in the ivory tower knows that the nicest car in the faculty lot invariably belongs to the wildest-eyed radical Marxist.  If ever their kids were zoned to go to school with the refugees they worked so long and hard to get into the town, they’d simply move… and then, while the exploited illegal alien moving guys were still unpacking their stuff, they’d be out there on the streets again, demanding more diversity in city schools.It may not be possible to make a complete New Soviet Man, in other words, but they’ve given it the old college try… and gotten more than halfway there.*that’s pretty much the only reason I’m on the internet — I can’t keep mouthing this stuff without an outlet for the CogDis, or I’d go insane.

        When I lived in California in the early 1980s, a psychotherapist I knew mentioned (without giving any further details and so respecting confidentiality) that she had one male client who wanted to have a sex change operation … so he could become a lesbian.This seemed beyond belief to me at the time. Today it would not surprise me that much.Kevin MacDonald calls the Jews a “culture of critique” — they must always be opposed to the Establishment (or what they imagine it to be, since in fact they are a large part of the Establishment). But now it’s not just the Jews, it’s a large percentage, maybe the majority, who embrace the culture of critique. Hey, white bougie, look at me! I’m farther out than you are! You’re a stick in the mud and I’m everything-fluid!Why this desperation to be outrageously different? As you and many commenters here have suggested, it’s partly social conditioning, the cult of rebellion that has dominated popular and intellectual culture at least since the Great War destroyed faith in political systems and traditional institutions. I think it’s also a need simply to be noticed in an impersonal world where machines talk to you on the phone and you can book a trip to Mongolia without speaking to a human being.Along with everything else that needs to be done to discourage the acting out of perverse impulses, we have to find ways to re-humanize society, to get us again relating to one another as individuals and not only through transactions.

            In the 1980s, The SFy author Jessica Amanda Salmonsen was a trans male-to-female who identified as a lesbian. At least that is what I understood from her fanguuurl defenders. Attempting to confirm this on Internet failed.

            According to McHugh, or whatever his name is. The guy who used to be the psychiatrist on the Johns Hopkins sex change team. Most male to female grannies remain sexually attracted to women. Besides the dysphoria toward their male bodies, they also think that they would be more attractive to women as a woman.I think this is the pathology of Bruce Jenner.

        Actually, a version of the demand to affirm obvious falsehoods has been going on for thousands of years.  It’s called paganism, IOW worship of the created over the creator.  Under paganism you are demanded to affirm that a carved hunk of wood or rock that is obviously not alive at all is actually a a powerful supernatural being that must be placated in some costly way with real stuff produced by the sweat of the brow.I was about to say ‘disagreeable way’ but except for that bit about burning up your own babies alive that the ancient Palestinians practiced, the drunken orgies part of worship had to be agreeable.  Or else it wouldn’t have persisted.So far as I know only the Chinese have broken the code and placate imaginary supernatural forces with imaginary sacrifices made of paper money, etc.

        The Prog world view is that the narrative is the reality.  Their fundamental error is that the narrative is instead an interpretation of reality, because humans make sense of the world by wrapping a story around what they see and experience.  Real world experience is a series of very random and messy things.  Building a narrative around the random and messy is how we cope, explain, and keep from going crazy.The Progs do two things with this.  First they create the most unlikely and self-serving narratives in the first place.  Then they tamp down the resulting cognitive dissonance by claiming that the narrative is the reality, and therefore determines the reality.  After all, are you going to believe the narrative or your own lying eyes?This all seems to follow from the idea that as the individual and his own self have been lifted to high esteem, over such notions as the community, the culture, or, God forbid, religious doctrine, then the individual is allowed to freely define the world around him.  Now the individual has taken on the challenge of bending “science” to his will, and science cannot be questioned, right?The fundamental problem now is that the narratives conjured up by the Progs bear so little resemblance to any known observations, that the inquisitions must begin.  Dalrymple’s very astute observation only gains traction in an environment where the unreal needs to be accepted by many as real, so the delusional ones can protect themselves.It is ironic that the Internet, which has quickly opened up the availability of human knowledge and information in a widespread fashion, has often been used not to further our understanding of our human nature and the universe around us, but instead to build a fortress of lies and delusion to protect ourselves from the reality of who we are and the environment in which we dwell.It sort of goes back to that age-old concept of man finding out the real truth of his own existence and losing his mind over finding out the answer.  Maybe there is something to it, and all of this delusional behavior has a good reason to be going on.

            This delusional behavior exist because it increases the power of government. That is why even red states enforce this crap, although to  a lesser degree so as not to get the frog noticing. It absolutely cannot exist without enforcement by a strong police state. Since the majority always support the military and the police it will only get worse. Oh, and the real truth of man’s existence; well that is just an old fashion love song, Genesis 2

            @Dutch:   Good comment.  But I think our greatest hope is the internet. Where would we be now, without internet communications? Isolated, demoralized and reluctant to tell our ideas to strangers.
Actually, we (Americans and conservatives) have had a lot of PURE LUCK, most recently the election of Trump (thanx, twitter).
If we are to have any hope of seeing the many crimes and misdeeds of the (D)irtbag party exposed, the internet will get the news out  even as the MSM does it’s utmost to obfuscate –

        ZMan… you state that Progs have been in control of the USA since the Civil War. I might push that date forward by a generation, but that’s a quibble. My question to you is why do you think conservatism has been unable to maintain its formerly dominant position against the radical and contrary ideas of Progressivism? Why have the rationalist ideals of the Enlightenment withered against the successive onslaught of Marxism, structuralism, post-modernism, neo-Marxism, etc.? Is there something inherent in conservatism tthat makes it ill-equipped to assert, convince and overcome?I’d love to hear your thoughts. Maybe worth a separate posting?

            Progressivism was birthed and came out of the Protestant churches in the early 1800s. It first took power with Abe Lincoln. Up until Teddy Roosevelt ran in his Progressive Party, both Republican and Democrat Parties were tilting progressive. Conservitives are progressives who want things to be as they were 30-40 years ago.Since 1860 it has all been downhill for liberty and freedom.

                    That about sums up Conservatives. Most are your classical French surrender monkeys. They surrendered to the Left on the culture wars in the 1970’s and in the 80’s on immigration. In the 90’s they voted to support “free trade” and globalization.When Trump came on the scene they just about had a heart attack. Here was a man who stood for everything they hated: Being proud to be a American, putting Americans first, honest trade, strong border security, limiting foreign engagements, etc.Until Trump threw his hat in the ring, I often wondered what good was the GOP and Conservatives were since they believed in most of the same stuff as the Dems.

                        I think your first inclination is still appropriate.  There is no difference between the parties and the GOP is not worth anything.  Just look at the problems both sides of the aisle are giving Trump and the GOP owns both sides of the Congress.No.  I think if it weren’t for our two party system, Trump really belongs to a “third” party and that is why both existing parties continue to block him however they can.I guess he had to have a label and support so he went with “Republican” but he doesns’t really fit either well.  He is definitely more rogue and more of a true patriot in my book.Maybe he could start the MinuteMan party for 2020?

Media  work naturally attracts glib, shallow people whose vanity compels them to “popular” positions.The real question is: how do conservatives ever win anything?The answer is important and should be very instructive : the only reason conservatives are ever able to win is because (most) people smarten up as they get older, further from govt. schools and more independant of “popular” opinion (indoctrination). It is ENTIRELY the ignorant and overpaid cronies keeping the fascists in power.

        I hope you’re right, but I am pessimistic. Look at the frenzy to destroy Trump. He and his voters are the mortal enemies of the whole Cult agenda. Maybe Trump hatred is the final burst of Cult madness, but, as I say, I see little to be optimistic about. He will be around for eight years  at best. Meanwhile, The NAACP, NFL and NBA just brought the North Carolina legislature to its knees. This will only encourage the crazies. They were, as you say, slowed down by the hot and cold wars of the 20th century. Similar catastrophes now are the only thing that would slow them down again. The options aren’t good.

        &gt; Humans come in one of two sexes, male and female. This is a matter of genetics.Alas for this simplistic view of things, biology is complex, and complex systems can and do screw up from time to time, in a wide variety of ways — from blatant cases where individuals with masculine appearing bodies turn out to be XX, or those individuals with XXY, to more subtle metabolic conditions that only manifest later in life.The real problem here is that having become designated victim group du jour, there is a whole bandwagon rolling of attention seekers and other sorts of mentally maladjusted, plus the victims of Munchhausen’s by proxy.

            Other than extremely rare situations (XXY, hermaphrodites) there is no biological (including hormonal) or neurological indication to the vast majority of these cases. Essentially, all evidence points to a psychological situation.I’ve known male and female cross dressers who fully understood they were playing a fantasy. They made no attempt to claim biology.Now, as with any psychologial problem, these people still have human rights but as with other delusions, that does not require others to buy into the belief.Saw a recent article about a 40 something man who identified as an 11 year old girl. The bizarre thing is that the law allowed us to disbelieve the 11 year old part (plainly untrue) but we were supposed to fully believe the gender part (equally obviously untrue.)

                Not only is this extremely rare, the person does not have both sets of fully working sex organs. In most cases, they merely have tissue for one or both. A phenotypically normal male, for example, with some undeveloped female sex organs.
There are no people walking around with fully functioning male and female sex organs. There are, however, people walking around who believe they are missing a limb, despite having both arms and legs. They are just as delusional as the guy wearing a sundress.

        My first thought when I read that story was that the dude was a big hairy troll par excellence.I actually wonder the same thing about Lactantius. When you read his defense of a flat world you have to realize that the tradition of the earth as a sphere with its circumference calculated by earlier Greeks had been around for centuries. The Ptolemaic theory was consistent with the earth being a sphere within concentric spheres.

            The blank slaters will run into the same problem as the free speech people. Once you say there are no rules, then you just invited the most extreme to go crazy. Within a short time, there will be men demanding to play women’s sports and whites insisting they are black, in order to get free stuff. The whole thing collapses.

                        I had a talk with an ex congressman around the time when the SCOTUS was about to rule on wacko marriage. He seemed to think things would end up with fishing buddies who share a boat getting married in order to keep their boat out of probate in the event of death.With any lib policy things end up absurd or dead.

                        @teapartydoc: Also, more BIG benefits for any unmarried govt. or big biz employee to share with another like minded fascist. That is some big money left on the table, and they LOVE them govt. freebies.
But I think the big motivation is adoption. Gay men now have the RIGHT to adopt boys, and I think we will soon see “gay married ” guys adopting girls – why not?

                I don’t know about men playing women’s sports (aren’t women playing men’s sports already?) but it seems to me that I read just yesterday about a white woman pretending to be black.I think we need to bring back asylums where people who have disordered minds would be safe. It seems to me after the idea of asylums were attacked by 1960s radicals, many social orders began to fall apart and things got worse and worse.
