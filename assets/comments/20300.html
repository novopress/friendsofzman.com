        Even more than the law, people fear the LEGAL PROCESS these days.  All the Constitutional guarantees of speedy fair trials are long forgotten.  An arrest and prosecution on any felony (i.e. gun possession in New Jersey) probably means loss of job and bankruptcy just to cover the legal fees.  They broke Michael Flynn on the wheel of legal process without any actual evidence.

            Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled o‚Äôer, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings: but I say, ‚Äôtis the bee‚Äôs wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since.

            Yes. I point that I have made many times is that the process IS the punishment. Most people simply cannot afford the ruinous cost and disruption of defending themselves. Even if they are successful, they are still ruined. Of course, TPTB know this.

                Many foreign countries have a ‚Äúloser pays winner‚Äôs legal costs‚Äù system in place for civil torts, lawsuits and such. Sometimes with the requirement to post a bond. I would add criminal trials too. I think that is a great idea and it‚Äôll be in my list when the new constitution is drawn up üôÇ

                    Some states in the U.S. have similar rules.  Unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt apply to criminal cases where cops and prosecutors can ruin you without any consequences to themselves.

                        Drake, the same is true in Britain in criminal prosecutions. A judge does have the power to order the state to pay the successful Defendant‚Äôs costs but application is rare.

                        What consequences. Even when such a thing occurs. The tax payers end up footing the cost. So in the end you are always paying for your own costs. Whether you win or not.
Police suffer consequences for false and perjured prosecutions so infrequently its an outlier at best.

                    That ‚Äòloser pays‚Äô law has a lot of downside too.  Imagine being hit by a car and then being forced to not only have to pay all your bills and legal fees, but paying the phony internally generated legal ‚Äúbills‚Äù of the insurance company!
Or the kangaroo court that ruled against Tommy Robinson and forced him to have to pay the state‚Äôs internally generated ‚Äúlegal costs‚Äù after harassing him.
This system is even more ripe for abuse than our system.

Correct. Most civil cases in Britain are a 50/50 proposition. The cost of losing is just catastrophic and most people are unwilling to risk that. Can‚Äôt say as I blame them.
The real problem is an inequality of arms. The British state or globohomo (but I repeat myself) has bottomless resources. Even if they lose, it‚Äôs just chump change to them. So they can afford to keep losing until they win.

                    This won‚Äôt work since State assets vastly outweigh individual ones and the State can just beat you into the ground and than jail you till you pay for it,Also corporations can do the same, sue ‚Äúbig co‚Äù and they can spend limitless sums to see you destroyed and make you pay for it after.Real reform means changing laws, enforcing laws against cruel and usual punishment and for speedy fair trials  a ban on plea bargains and probably a barrister system where you don‚Äôt know if you will be a prosecutor that case or  a defense attorney.This will have bad effects in many areas as the US is so lawless in some areas that we simply cannot afford to lock up people but so be it.Ultimately if there is a future USA its going to have top be built to tolerate a very high level of instability for several generations until a stable moral system can be built.And note, ‚Äúmuh Christendom‚Äù probably won‚Äôt work. The US is more moral and Christian than basically  anyone in the first world and worse off for it.It means secular policy for build long term thinking and stability.It may behoove the hypothetical ‚ÄúNu State‚Äù to shoot all the troublemakers during an interregnum, gangster, grifters and repeat offenders as well.Along with heavy repatriation should  lead to much less crime and decide and bad conduct and thus stabilize the system.

                I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre aware of it or not,but U.S.prosecutors have theHIGHEST CONVICTION RATEin the world. Even in nations ruled by dictators, prosecutors lose more than they do here. IMS, the U.S.Conviction rate is in excess of 95%.

                    It‚Äôs largely a function of plea agreements. We‚Äôll charge you with 3,000 years worth of offenses and you can roll the dice or you can plead guilty to three years.There‚Äôs also the matter of gross imbalance in the Judges application of the law. If a prosecutor promises a snitch a reduced sentence, better visitation rights, etc that‚Äôs just fine. If a defense attorney offers a defense witness inducements that‚Äôs witness tampering.The law is a tool of the State, not a defense against it.

                A good example of this is that White Christian baker in the USA (Colorado, I think) who is pretty much under constant siege by the forces of globohomo. He is eventually vindicated but so what? The point is not achieve any sort justice or legal standard. The object is to break him. Eventually they will succeed.

            This is true, but not universal.  It is the tyranny part of anarcho-tyranny. While you are being bankrupt by the system and facing very real prison time, the ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù masses are going through the catch and release system and not paying a dime either directly or through taxes.It is the Houston County ‚Äújudge‚Äù (not really a judge, just an odd naming convention) who tries to release 4000 violent convicted criminals from prison while saying people not wearing masks will be subject to $1000 fine and 180 days in jail!

            Speaking of the‚Äúlegal process‚ÄùThe whole process begins with an indictment/accusation made bythe government.Thetrialtakes place in a ‚Äúcourt house‚Äù owned bythe government.The accused is tried before a judge paid bythe government.They‚Äôre tried by a lawyer paid bythe government.They‚Äôre defended by a lawyer who holds his/her license fromthe government.And to keep everything orderly there‚Äôs a guy/gal off to one side ‚Äì armed to the teeth ‚Äì paid bythe government.What part of the above sounds in any wise like a recipe for anything which could even remotely be called ‚Äújustice‚Äù?All criminal defendants ought to have to enter the courthouse through a door over which is inscribed‚ÄúAbandon hope, all ye who enter here.‚Äù

            IOW, sophistry.  Sophistry permeates public discussion in the US and probably the English speaking world in general.
Really, the law is whatever they say it is.  The courts completely ignore what the Constitution actually says and invent things the Constitution does not mention at all.  This is mostly done by sophistry, word games.
Is it really a surprise that they do this when law is so heavily influenced by Jews who pride themselves on their verbal abilities?

        This is why the left pushes the ‚Äúliving constitution‚Äù nonsense. The law means what they feel it should mean. It‚Äôs also why they use selective prosecution.  One of the most dangerous realities to our side are Soros funded local prosecutors who ignore left-wing violence, but become Inspector Javert to every right-winger who defends himself.

            You should look up the current prosecutor of Philadelphia, Larry Krasner.  A raving SJW whose campaign was funded by Soros.He campaigned on a criminal justice ‚Äúreform‚Äù platform. This was not empty campaign rhetoric. He has utterly destroyed Philadelphia‚Äôs law enforcement abilities. His office refuses to press charges or lowers chargers and rarely seeks bail.  Even before Coronachan was used an excuse to empty the prisons, the Philly county lockup was like 1/2 empty.I‚Äôve seen stories of guys out on bail twice over (arrested, bail, arrested again while out on bail and given bail again) for violent gun crime going out and committing yet more gun crime including shooting people and killing.Or California‚Äôs decriminalized shoplifting.  Dallas, TX is doing the same thing.It is the anarcho side of anarcho-tyranny.  Of course, it is all race based.  South Africa aside, America is the most race conscious society on Earth.  Blacks (especially) and ‚Äòbrowns‚Äô walk around with a giant racial chip on their shoulder daring white people to push it off.  Being black is a central organizing feature of ‚Äúblack life‚Äù and the ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù are catching up quickly.  Virtually every profession you can think of has a ‚Äúblack‚Äù professional group.  Yet, any racial consciousness, aside from raging guilt is completely out of the question for the shrinking white majority of the country.The worst of this racial insanity is yet to come. The kids being raised today are being taught this stuff at an insane level. White children are already no longer a majority. Their minds are being poisoned and will affect them for the rest of their lives.  What insanity, unthinkable today will be the norm in 20 years?  Will public race based apology/struggle sessions be the norm, a repeat of the cultural revolution only the blacks and browns will be berating (and eventually killing) white people?

        Bill and Hillary Clinton might be the most famous sociopaths but that has definitely trickled down through the halls of power. I mean look at that loser bully Chris Como. He was caught out of his house when he was supposed to be quarantined, hanging with his family and another person, a police report was filed it made news and he still filmed his heroic emergence from his basement after his two-week quarantine sometime later. It boggles the mind really.

        Nuts and bolts. Good decent men at the bottom of the law enforcement pyramid will now arrest a mother shepherding her children in a playground (and yes, that includes handcuffs and a ride in the police car, all played out dramatically in front of her kids) because these officers have been trained to follow orders (no matter how insane). Do this often enough, and you eventually get to officially sanctioned genocide. It‚Äôs just a matter of time and repetitive practice. When a tyrant gets the taste of power on his/her lips, the addiction is overwhelming.

                    Like all bureaucracy, police will select for those who defend the prerogatives and privileges of the institution. They may not do so explicitly at the front end, but they do so implicitly as a matter of process. This is theIron Law of Bureaucracy.
In sane societies, the game is to make sure the population is such that you don‚Äôt need policing. In liberal democracy, the opposite seems to hold. Society becomes a game preserve that requires an endless expansion of game keepers and wardens.

                        In grad school I remember being told a story, perhaps apocryphal, although the professor was a fairly down-to-earth, balanced man, about Korean strong man and President (1980-1988), Chun Doo-hwan.  Chun had come to the United States in the late 50s to attend the combat school at Fort Black in North Carolina.  On one occasion he was driving back to his abode in the dead of the night and came up on a red light in the middle of some podunk, 4-corner town.  There was a car in front of him and the light turned red.  He noticed that the person in front of him sat at the light until it turned green, despite it being clear that there wasn‚Äôt another soul on the road.  He thought to himself that at home in Korea that would have never happened and that until his countrymen showed such an intrinsic respect for the law the ROK could never be considered modern.

            I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of line to predict, some time in the future, whites will be gathered, lined up and openly executed in front of pre-dug disposal pits. It won‚Äôt be in total, and will be given some bovine excrement of a term, like ‚Äúridding of dangerous insurgents‚Äù, but the start down the road has already begun. White are becoming a minority in America, constantly insulted and worst -dehumanized, the critical step in marking anything as disposable. Seen it happen before.

                While I think something like this is a ways off, I could see a form of state-backed reparations being enacted. White taxes and such ‚Äî kinda like jizya.

                    Whites don‚Äôt have that much money or stuff o take and are well armed. If we steadfastly refuse to learn to organize, we deserve the boxcars.My suspicion is that Whites are starting to learn to get  well organized at protests for guns, jobs and elsewhere and for less above board things, in quiet private places.Given how unstable things are, well it won‚Äôt be pleasant.Given the stories I‚Äôm seeing, the US may soon have real serious food shortages anyway either induced or because we simply built too brittle a system to save a few bucks.This could be our Chernobyl and frankly its ammunition to those of us who wonder why the Union even exists anyway.Over the next few years it might be best to figure out where you want you and any future offspring if you-are having any to live as if we go ‚Äúbloop‚Äù you may not be able to just go where you want.The coastal states probably won‚Äôt allow it if they can manage that and the better ones, don‚Äôt allow just anyone in.

                @ Forever TemplarThe reason whites won‚Äôt ever be mass executed the way you describe is, who is going to do it?  Asians, Hispanics, Blacks?None of those people can accomplish anything on their own.  Everything from the clothes on their backs to the plumbing in their walls was given to them by white men.  One white man is worth one hundred of any other race.By the time the rising tide of color is high enough to drown the last whites, there won‚Äôt be enough guns and bullets available, and they won‚Äôt know how to make more.  They don‚Äôt know how to make anything.  Literally, they have to be instructed by white men.

                    @ Lowe: I heard an exchange, or maybe read about it,some years ago. Perhaps the story is apocryphal, perhaps not ‚Äì but here it is anyway.A regular dude, a white guy, was in the black part of town at some store or other ‚Äì a curb market or convenience store ‚Äì and some brothers came in and started talking smack about how they were going to stick it to ‚Äúthe man,‚Äù to people like our pale-skinned protagonist. How they were going to come to his neighborhood and terrorize it and then burn it down.The white guy listened for a while, and then replied that if the dudes from the ‚Äòhood wanted to go down that path, they‚Äôd better be aware of a few things. Things like the fact that in all of human history, no one has waged war more-completely or more-violently than white men. That all of the most-destructive technologies of making war were invented by European (white) civilization. Including the atomic bomb. He ended by saying, ‚ÄúWhen y‚Äôall get mad, a neighborhood gets burned. When my people get mad, continents burn.‚ÄùThe story goes that at this point, some old black church ladies ‚Äì who‚Äôd been listening in quietly ‚Äì joined in and scolded the troublemakers from the hood and sent them packing.Whether the story is factual or not, the message is correct. If you plan on opening the ball on white folks, you‚Äôd better be prepared for hell-on-earth, because that‚Äôs what you are going to get.As Rudyard Kipling wrote, ‚ÄúBeware the Wrath of Awakened Saxon‚ÄùTheir voices were even and low.Their eyes were level and straight.There was neither sign nor showWhen the Saxon began to hate.In other words, be very sure you want to open that particular can of whoop ass, because once you open it, there‚Äôs no closing it.

                @ Forever Templar:Re: ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of line to predict, some time in the future, whites will be gathered, lined up and openly executed in front of pre-dug disposal pits.‚ÄùSome may accuse you of panic-mongering, of fear-mongering,but there is more than a bit of truth in your statement.The late Dr. R.J. Rummel studied genocides and mass killings virtually his whole career as a political scientist. He made many important discoveries and insights, one of which was that such acts of mass bloodletting do not occur in a cultural-political vacuum, but instead occur by a fairly predictable series of steps, each escalating toward violence at the end.In plain language, most humans don‚Äôt wake up and decide to commit genocide one day. Typically, the process begins with one group in society, usually the dominant one but not always, scapegoating another for the ills and faults of that particular society. The now-classic example is the Jews in pre-war Nazi Germany. Jews and other ‚Äúunder men‚Äù ‚Äì Untermenschen ‚Äì were blamed or scapegoated for all of the problems of German society.Scapegoating progresses to the progressively more-severe and punitive measures taken against the blamed: the wearing of yellow star armbands; confiscation of businesses and economic assets, boycotts of Jewish owned businesses, riots, arson, beatings administered to Jews, and finally to imprisonment and murder.The scapegoating process is part of what is called ‚Äúpseudo-speciation,‚Äù i.e., the labeling of fellow humans as sub-humans and therefore not really human at all. And if the targeted group aren‚Äôt human, then it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong‚Äù to wage war upon them, to kill them. That how figures like Hitler sold this to the German population as a whole.My somewhat long-winded point is this: The scapegoating process ‚Äì in this case against people of European ancestry, a.k.a. whites ‚Äì has been underway for a long time now in this country. In particular, against traditional, rural, Christian white males.Moreover, the communists have been talking amongst themselves for a long time about exterminating this same population. At one time, such talk was only on the fringes of the left, but today, it has gone mainstream to such an extent that many figures on the hard left now speak of it openly, albeit couched in language which strives to lend respectability to their radicalism and hate.If that isn‚Äôt enough bad news for one post, I‚Äôll leave you with this. Tyrants in history invariably try very hard to disarm those they mean to enslave and/or exterminate. Just as the Muslim Ottoman Turks disarmed over a million Armenian and Greek Christians before killing them a century ago, so too do modern-day would-be tyrants seek to disarm those whom they would victimize.Never surrender your arms, and for goodness sake, don‚Äôt get into any boxcars‚Ä¶.

Nothing. You live in a tyranny and have a family to take care of. Superheroes only exist in movies and only a moron, an autist or desperado with nothing to lose would confront the system head on.
At best you may try some indirect action, if you have a reliable network and have the ability to mitigate the risks to your loved ones.

Something Americans don‚Äôt understand. You don‚Äôt live in a free country anymore. Act accordingly. If you want to confront the system, you have to consider how it will affect your family. How is that a difficult concept to understand? Confront the system head on and your whole family will suffer. That is how these things always go.You need to keep a cool head and resolve the situation with minimum or no harm to your family.

            I read Orwell‚Äôs Animal Farm yesterday. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read it before. It‚Äôs really more of a booklet than a book. You know he‚Äôs a great writer and he has some wonderful insights but he did think that there was an idyllic period that lasted for years after the totalitarians took over. And in The Road to Wigan Pier, he didn‚Äôt see any way out of the underclass class ever getting work ever again since war was totally out of the question. That was a 1938.

        ‚ÄúA world with no tomorrow‚Äù.Liberalism is a death cult. But anyhow, a world with no tomorrow is an important feature of our fear-panic inspired totalitarianism.A world on the precipice, be it virus or climate or a question of bathrooms, does not have time for the old ways; no, we need to move forward to defeat the great threat. We are all in this together.Perhaps the End of history had this part right. A perpetual Today World can only exist if History is killed. So they obliged.Without history, tomorrow is an abstraction entirely up for grabs. The powers will dangle the carrot of a possible future while they flog you into submission because we don‚Äôt have time for the luxury of carrots. The honey and hemlock of muh democracy.For some reason people yell on their porches at 8pm. The buildings downtown have giant heart-shaped lights. ‚ÄúStay safe‚Äù is the essential retail farewell. Heroes are born every 15 minutes now.They want this to be our finest hour. A battle of Britain but with netflix and take-out thai.Even near the end, when the enemy is almost invisible, like some V2 virus rocket, the buzz is deafening, and there is still a *chance* it will hit your apartment.It doesn‚Äôt matter that it is a cheap Chinese made facsimile of an actual war. Nobody remembers actual war. Or even true discomfort.The big screen glows and soma flows and well if tomorrow does come, we should all just be happy to be alive. The little freedoms we have to give up are nothing compared to the blackness of no tomorrow.Finally, the neurotic are vindicated; there is every reason to be afraid. Especially of that neighbor who does not wear a mask. Something must be done!

            The Mother Earth cult became the unofficial state religion back in the 60s and 70s. It‚Äôs a secular religion. Problem is, with secular religions there‚Äôs no god whose judgments overrides the opinions of mere men. That‚Äôs why looming apocalypse has to be an integral part of any secular religion. Omnipresent impending doom is necessary to keep people afraid, compliant, and to justify its high priests‚Äô demands for more and more power.
Keep in mind, the Booby‚Äôs firmly an agnostic, he‚Äôs not preaching any particular religion here, just stating the facts about the pernicious nature of secular religions.

        One example of corruption of the letter of the law is how gun grabbers are trying to redefine ‚Äúwell regulated‚Äù in the second amendment to mean ‚Äúeverything is banned except for what we say isn‚Äôt banned, and we can add to the list of banned stuff anytime we want.‚ÄùIn reality, ‚Äúwell regulated‚Äù when written simply meant well-trained (that‚Äôs where the idea of a ‚Äúregular‚Äù soldier or militiaman comes from). The spirit of the amendment was to accommodate free association: all free white men were encouraged to self-organize and to conduct any self-training with arms they saw fit to function as an effective militia. Now that ‚Äúwell regulated‚Äù has been redefined, white men organizing into militias and training themselves as they see fit is seen as one of the world‚Äôs greatest evils and most dangerous and unacceptable acts.

Now, Prussia and the German region were some 1600 independent duchies, not yet integrated into a nation-state as they were under the great Bismarck in‚Ä¶ 1880, I think?
So the ‚ÄòHuns‚Äô often formed autonomous mercenary corps not only for self defense, but for hire.
More like the Mongols or Vikings- or Teddy Roosevelt‚Äôs Raiders.
Each state, by the way, has irregular militias that offer training to civvies and are legally recognized, under the Constitution, per state law.  Hint, hint.

        I remember the Lewinsky scandal from when I was in college. The pure salaciousness of it overwhelmed the realization that the rule of law was being undermined in a way that would have serious consequences in the future. Oral sex not being sex and the quibbles over ‚Äúis and alone‚Äù still echo today.We let that deviant and his evil wife off the hook completely. The economy was too good to change horses, even though the 90s boom was a function of new, emerging tech companies and was like the Emperor, totally lacking substance. The boom of the 90s happened in spite of Clinton and his administration.When I got into arguments with lefty about guns, they‚Äôd throw up all of this static about how the militia is the National Guard, etc. When asked why the Founders would enshrine a right to a National Guard in the Bill of Rights, lefty would usually end with an ad hominen attack and flee from logic like Dracula from the true cross.The law is now whatever the ruling class says it is. The constitution, which was on its way out anyway since the priests in black robes in the Supreme Court found banning free association constitutional and found rights such as infanticide and sodomite marriage in there, is a dead piece of paper that is only revered by the delusional.

        ‚ÄúFor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.‚Äù We get those from the bureaucratic state all the time. This lockdown over a version of a Corona strain is a fine example. Destroy a hundred million lives to save a few months for some grandmothers.The one thing to remember is ‚ÄúEvery decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under.‚Äù Our Empire has spread death and destruction at home and around the world from the very beginning. We keep finding ways to make it even worse, but there really was no ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù. (maybe the feds under Coolidge were somewhat tolerable)We are doomed because everyone is taught to worship the State, and to figure that if things are going badly then it is just that we put the wrong people in charge. Vote out the bastards! We will make it better!  ‚Ä¶. Horse shit.

In the Plyler v. Doe case of 1982 the United States Supreme Court made it illegal for states to deny education to illegal aliens, then in the same case on an unrelated subject the Court said that children born to illegal aliens on American soil are by definition American citizens.

        Rex Lex or Lex Rex? goes the old debate. Is the King law or is the Law king? We can‚Äôt even begin to answer this question in America because we have to pretend we don‚Äôt have a King, or multiple not-so-benign despots floating around. Normie cons think the Constitution is King; progressives think anyone who isn‚Äôt white or male has a right to rule as the personal king over everyone who is white or male, in perpetuity, as revenge for history. Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg and everyone with a top secret clearance at any alphabet organization thinks they‚Äôre king, and they‚Äôre probably not wrong.

        The law, in spirit or in letter, is ignored by many because it simply doesn‚Äôt make any sense in a particular instance, doesn‚Äôt provide for needed exceptions, or is unlikely to be enforced. For instance, even in the wilds of bush Alaska there are fish and game laws. The locals violate the Migratory Bird Treaty because they need the protein, shoot moose out of season for the same reason, and know that if they can‚Äôt hear an aircraft flying nearby they‚Äôre unlikely to be caught gutting a moose. There‚Äôs no guilt in defying a law meant for tourists rather than residents.When some laws are disregarded in this way, however, there are consequences. The consequences of the Volstead Act were so negative that the 21st amendment to the Constitution was passed to eliminate it. Laws that can‚Äôt be enforced without draconian methods and are then violated with impunity lead to the same attitude toward other laws. Although marijuana is somehow an illegal substance in federal eyes, most local jurisdictions now ignore its use. A driver is unlikely to be stopped by the police for speeding at night in rural Nebraska so the speed limit is meaningless to him, as it probably should be.

        ‚ÄúCorrupting the spirit of the law is a tougher process.‚ÄùI would suggest a third corruption of Law; bureaucratic devolution into morass.The power of law is bestowed by Congress to a bureaucracy and that bureaucracy is given carte blanche application to address some emergency. ‚ÄúEmergency powers‚Äù beget ‚Äúthe way we live now‚Äù which eventually begets ‚Äúit‚Äôs been this way as long as anyone remembers.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs the reason the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco keeps adding letters until it becomes the B.A.F.T.E. It‚Äôs why our cell phone bills carried a surcharge for the Spanish American War a hundred years after the war. It‚Äôs why the B.L.M., once custodians of the Peoples Land mutates into Harry Reid‚Äôs personal financial enrichment SWAT enforcement force.Bureaucracy eventually cares nothing for the spirit of the law as it mutates into a self serving monster that long ago forgot why it was born. Nor does it care for the letter, as regulation voted on by nobody will carry the full weight of law.Pournelle‚Äôs Iron Law of Bureaucracy is spot on.

            Thanks for that link!Some money quotes from this article I missed, although I read Z-H fairly regularly:‚ÄúIn truth, if you were real men you‚Äôd grow up and spend that time acquiring skills to become a man worthy of allaying the fears of all the Karens you say are destroying your favorite stories.Who knows? You might even get laid!? Just sayin‚Äô‚ÄùThis speaks to my personal experience. Living in the NYC corridor, between that shithole and Fairfield County, CT, and including Westchester County, I get to interact with men that have acquired the following skills:a. Sit on ass.b. Commute.c. Click keyboard.d. Stare at screen.c. Make money via a through d.I have a running joke at the expense of these acquaintances. When they show me their latest girly ‚Äúporsh-ah‚Äù Macan, I coo, ‚Äúwow‚Ä¶ hey pop the hood and let me see what is under there‚Ä¶‚ÄùThen I laugh uproariously as they fumble around, keep fumbling as I ask, ‚Äúuh, you don‚Äôt know how to open the hood, dooyah?‚ÄùThen reach in and pop it for them. Same place, left foot well, driver‚Äôs side.I tell you, it reduces smarmy VP of finance to nerd getting a wedgie. Then I get to laugh about it forever with my male friends and sons. ‚ÄúHey, you know that dork Francis, he doesn‚Äôt know how to open the hood on his fancy fucking car.‚ÄùWithout the need to say it, a fair number of these super master(bators) of the universe are divorce raped, or clearly not getting sex from their wives and a lot of their sons turn out gay or effeminate, not that there is any connection to the father being unable to open the hood on the car.Even funnier.

        When I hear the term ‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Age‚Äù (Zeitgeist) I think of CS Lewis.
‚Äò‚Ä¶The Spirit of the Age wishes to allow argument and not to allow argument.‚Äô
‚ÄòHow is that?‚Äô
‚ÄòYou heard what they said. If anyone argues with them they say that he is rationalizing his own desires, and therefore need not be answered. But if anyone listens to them they will then argue themselves to show that their own doctrines are true.‚Äô
FromPilgrim‚Äôs Regress. Probably Lewis‚Äô most esoteric book, but in my opinion, one of his best.

        Trump  criticized Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp‚Äôs decision decision to reopen sooner than expected.  I was watching a video in which   billionaire trump supporter Dan Pe√±aexpressed support for the shutdowns and predicted things would get much worse.  One thing I have noticed is, the very wealthy, on either side of the aisle, want these shutdowns to last as long as possible and believe or want to believe that Corona is  serious enough that it justifies the measures being taken. It‚Äôs only the middle-class who are expressing the most skepticism. The middle class are the only people not  out of touch with reality. This virus is more of a class issue than a political one. The wealthy see this as an opportunity to gain power over everyone else.

            Well, today we got the first batch of generalized anti-body testing results in these parts‚Ä¶.and as predicted, a fuck ton of people tested positive.  And this is in the densest mortality region of the country.  So suddenly with a true denominator, the CFR on this is going to plummet.

                yes, Cuomo claims 20% of NYC residents would have antibodies from being infected, based on a ‚Äúrandom samples‚Äù taken across the state. That would be 1.6million  out of 8million city dwellers. Yet only 3500 have died; the other 1.597million have recovered, probably not even realizing they had been sick.
edit:3500 died in Brooklyn; NYC total ‚Äúincludes 9,944 victims who tested positive for the disease plus 5,052 people who showed tell-tale symptoms of the virus but never received a test.‚Äù

                    This is how they will maintain the desired mortality rate ‚Äì they just classify all deaths as caused by coronavirus.
First they added people who died ‚Äúwith‚Äù the virus to people who died ‚Äúfrom‚Äù the virus. Then they added never-tested people with allegedly ‚Äútell-tale‚Äù signs of the virus. And then they add every other death so that the reported mortality can stay high as testing shows increasing share of population with antibodies.

Britain has been too slow on many fronts in the first weeks of this crisis. We must now take seriously the example of other nations who have successfully restored some normality to life, and rapidly develop a system of digital surveillance that is comprehensive and useful enough to map and break chains of infection extremely quickly.

                This response, and the growing drumbeat for turning the West into a China style totalitarian surveillance state, has been in the works for decades.9/11 was used as an excuse to radically expand emergency powers.Now, the virus, just as the number of deaths in the U.S. and Europe is shrinking, is being used as an excuse to create an Orwellian nightmare, and at least half the public will go along with it without question or complaint.I never thought they would just roll it out all at once, but here we go folks.Put your seatbelt on and get used to life in the Soviet States of America, in the name of saving us from getting sick.

        Our Anglo-Saxon common law tradition was a formalized, written transformation of the older tribal practice of leaving judgments to wise men based on tradition. Celts &amp; Teutons, for all their lack of written law, had a sophisticated oral tradition administered by druidic and bardic classes and largely enforced and honored by the warrior class. The ancient Greek and Latin tribes developed similar oral Homeric-style customs long before they started writing.Written law is considered an ‚Äúevolution‚Äù from these oral traditions but these ‚Äúadvances‚Äù come with their own downsides that are often ignored to better fit the ‚Äúarc of history‚Äù narrative.Guys in medicine, finance and law alike are familiar with the tradeoffs that come from reducing a set of ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and professional hueristics to a set of formalized, black-letter rules administered by third parties.The ‚Äúself-policing‚Äù problem presents one set of limitations and a ‚Äúwatch the watchers‚Äù system presents others.  Formal law can be lawyered while a more ‚Äúfuzzy ethics‚Äù system can better distinguish bad-faith black letter compliance from disputes arising between parties acting in mutual good faith.Like most things modern, our myopic and Procrustean conflation of ‚Äúnew‚Äù with ‚Äúbetter‚Äù has left us blind to what we‚Äôve left behind in the march Forward to Progress.If we wanted to tweak the American system, a good place to start would be the judiciary ‚Äì make their power commensurate with their accountability.  The present kritarchy exercises essentially dictatorial power.  Rome limited its dictators to six month terms, not lifetime appointments with generous pensions.That said, there are too many kludges and tweaks the present system would require to make it temporarily functional.  A complete demo and rebuild is the only way to have a sustainable structure.

        It‚Äôs consistent. Our society values license more highly than anything else and is at war with everything that limits license ‚Äì family, patriarchy, tradition, religion, and as Z points out, law.It‚Äôs part of a long process ‚Äì we can think of Henry VIII‚Äôs insistence not merely that everyone acknowledge his power but that they pretend to believe his acts were just. It was a precursor, in some ways, to our own totalitarianism. Our age is not content to police acts, it wants to police your soul.This is why the idea we can fix this with laws is absurd. We have laws ‚Äì it is the law that is their enemy ‚Äì so it doesn‚Äôt matter at all what new ones we scribble out.Our age has no law and we are all, then, outlaws.

        ‚ÄúSomeone high up in the Obama administration decided to use the surveillance agencies for domestic spying, which is in direct violation of the law.‚Äù   Here‚Äôs one problem: the separation between CIA and FBI is not mandated by law, but by a post-Watergate executive order (12333).  What‚Äôs the penalty for violating an executive order?  You can certainly be fired, but can you go to prison?  We‚Äôll see when Durham comes down with indictments.

Their failures are made whole and better  by retaining subsidies and profits while the public purse pays for its failures, costs and growth. Over the past dozen years the public purse has given the banking and finance sector $29 trillion for the  2008 bailout and $15 trillion during the past 7 months in assorted bailouts/infusions. Add to that the quarterly QE that‚Äôs gone on in between.  Your precious markets at work‚Ä¶Their failure is their Midas Touch and it will remain so for as long as we play by the current rules: heads they win, tails you lose‚Ä¶plus alpha as their need arises.Kill their ability to bend the laws to their needs by killing off their perpetual money making machine: endless bailouts-subsidies and the interest they manipulate and weaponize through central banking.  To use a malaphor ‚Äúwe need to get to the head of the snake‚Äù.And we can do this by nationalizing the entire banking system.  ‚ÄúSocialist Distancing‚Äù may be the new conservative attempt at humorous philosophizing but he joke and the expense of that joke is on them.

        As to spying on citizens inside the boundaries of the country being illegal, the violation of that is of a piece in denying the existence of borders and boundaries in the first place.

        Every new law brings new opportunities for the liberal democratic ruling elite to torment the public. Since words have no meaning and the spirit of the law is strangled in its crib, the law is whatever the ideological enforcers happen to think it means in any given moment.Thus modern laws are written (literallycrafted) in such a way as to make them open to any interpretation the ruling elite (and their enforcing thugs) choose to give them. I have read that there are so many laws on the books today that the average citizen commitsat leastone outrightFELONYevery day! There are so many laws on the books that Robocop with a 5G connection to the fastest supercomputer in existence could not enforce them properly. When a person can be prosecuted for making a gun shape with his hand and‚Äúpointing‚Äùit in the direction of a law enFORCEment officer, you know we are too far down the road to tyranny to have anyhopeof return. And as we have seen recently ‚Äì surfers and paddle boarders cited off shore of an empty beach in Kali and Tom  Brady cited for trying to work out in a public park ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a terriblysofttyranny, either.

        &gt;‚ÄùStill, it is worth considering what it is that motivates the citizen in the liberal democracy, as it is certainly not virtue or honor.‚Äù
The desire for ‚Äì in fact, the demand for the right to ‚Äì ‚Äúfree‚Äù government money, and consequence-free cummies.
No, really, that‚Äôs all that motivates citizens in a liberal democracy. There‚Äôs no great mystery to it. It really is just as simple, base, and banal as that.

        Re: ‚Äù Even the most radical mind of his age would have scoffed at the idea of giving women and criminals the franchise‚Ä¶//‚Ä¶They surely would have assumed you were mad if you suggested there were more than two sexes. Not so long ago, what we take for granted was beyond the realm of imagination.‚ÄùHuh? What ‚Äòwe take for granted‚Äô? Speak for yourself, sir. Sex is biologically-immutable, and are there two of them ‚Äì male and female ‚Äì in the human animal, notwithstanding how much that reality drives neo-Marxist social justice warrior types over the edge.The leftist neologism ‚Äúgender‚Äù was created decades ago in part to escape this reality. By inventing a term to substitute and eventually replace the well-defined word ‚Äúsex,‚Äù the Cultural Marxists opened the door for all sorts of mischief-making and flights of fancy. What are they up to now, 30 or so ‚Äògenders‚Äô?Re: ‚ÄúThat leaves us with fear as the great motivator, but not fear of the despot. Instead, it is a fear of the law itself. Every new law brings new opportunities for the liberal democratic ruling elite to torment the public. Since words have no meaning and the spirit of the law is strangled in its crib, the law is whatever the ideological enforcers happen to think it means in any given moment.‚ÄùAmerica has had a two-tiered justice system for a long time. One set of rules ‚Äì strictly enforced ‚Äì for the masses, and another ‚Äì much less-strictly enforced ‚Äì for the political and economic elites of the ruling class. Ted Kennedy, through his negligence, killed poor Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick in July 1969. If he‚Äôd been a normal man, he‚Äôd have done hard time for negligent homicide or some form of man-slaughter. Because he was a member of the American aristocracy, a serving Senator and the son of one of the most-influential figures in the country ‚Äì Joseph P. Kennedy ‚Äì he got off without so much as a slap on the wrist.A nation either has the rule of law or it doesn‚Äôt. Obeying the law some of the time while claiming to uphold it is like being half-pregnant. There‚Äôs no such thing. Parsing the letter of the law versus the spirit of the law is akin to debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.Question: Are we are a nation of laws or not?Answer: No, we are not ‚Äì and have not been in a very long time.What we are is a nation of men, some of whom follow the law when it is convenient and some of whom do not. Others of whom must follow the law exactly or risk being ruined and crushed by the power of the state.When the powerful transgress, it is rare for anything untoward to happen to them.Remember when Obama, Holder, and Napolitano ran guns into Mexico in ‚ÄúFast and Furious,‚Äù an operation the end-result of which was the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and some two hundred Mexican nationals?For years, Terry‚Äôs family have waited ‚Äì in vain, as it turns out ‚Äì for justice to be done in their son‚Äôs name. Cue the crickets chirping. Nothing was done; nothing has been done. Obama, the Democrat ‚ÄúTeflon President,‚Äù skated away and won a second term. A smile on his face, probably because he knew he‚Äôd gotten away with murder!Any sense of normalcy and whatever residue of our once-vaunted ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù remain only because the so-called ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù still believe in the rule of law and civil society, and abide more-or-less voluntarily by the old rules. Because there are still a few civil servants and government employees ‚Äì not enough, but a few ‚Äì who still believe in integrity, virtue and doing what is right. The majority of the ruling class, however, is as lawless as any Old West gang of outlaws or any gang of mobsters.Does the ruling class realize that they are playing, literally, with fire? What do they think will happen when the great mass of people in that ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù suddenly and finally realize that they have been well-and-truly duped, and that no one is following the law but them?A man with nothing to lose is a dangerous man indeed, and our ‚Äúruling elites‚Äù are creating a nation full of them by shredding our freedoms and civil liberties and destroying what remains of our economic prosperity.

        agreed Mr Zman. we are at the logical endpoint of the ‚Äúpure reason‚Äù age.this is why Montesquieu and the republicains/enlighteners had it wrong. yes, virtue, however you define it? greater good than what other good? which interests of what community?as always, materialists looking at the processes, without looking at the particulars, and the Uncaused from where all proceeds. by looking at processes, they can reify law, and since law is only written and words change meaning according to the media, then the bourgeois commie-corporate elite that writes the laws wins. the commie side wants peasant‚Äôs lifestyle, the corporate side wants peasant‚Äôs profit. and voila, coincidentally, we arrive at rule by (((scribes))).idk, but to me, we had to keep Latin Masses, some degree of organic hierarchy, and/or whatever eternal spirit fed the resistance to all this degeneracy that impacts the world and particularly the white and/or Westerner. else we are going to keep tumbling on those Spengler-Nietzsche cycles; while we cower from the wuflu and abandon our temples and nature, the Saracens mock social distancing and continue on their Ramadan‚Ä¶

        Zman, overall a good post. Re the Montesquieu words: ‚ÄúIn republican societies, it is virtue that inspires the people. By virtue, he meant the willingness to put the interests of the community ahead of private interests. To sacrifice for the greater good.‚Äù Well I‚Äôm sorry but this just aroused my inner Ayn Rand üòÄ She would have criticized (correctly) as follows. In the first place, a virtue is a desirable quality, nothing more nor less. In the second place, she‚Äôd have called his ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù as ‚Äúaltruism,‚Äù something she abhorred. She, or a Harry Browne would claim: In a free society, men should follow their self-interests, with the least necessary government restrictions, and from this the greatest good will result.‚Äù More or less the libertarian ideal. Of course, altruism and a willingness, perhaps under exceptional circumstances, to risk/sacrifice the self for the group do exist, probably because they have ‚Äúsurvival value‚Äù to the species as a biologist would say. But the State should not coerce altruism. Just like charity, kindness and so on, these things work much better when they are done voluntarily and not by force.

            If you want to live in a community, you have *duties* to the community. Period. One of those duties is to put others ahead of yourself; (child-bearing) women and children first, for example. The libertarians fill up the life raft with old men and then wonder why there is nobody to carry on civilization.

                Rand, Goldwater, Milt Friedman- they turned a workable compromise, Tenth Amendment classical liberals, into free-trade, homo economicus libertarianism.
Hollywood gave all the TV time in the world to evangelical grifters, making the long scholarship of the Christians into a Third Temple showcase of buffoons.
Do these have any connection with the 60s Cultural Revolution that Epiminondas mentions above, the one kick-started with the assassination of our first WASC president?

            The ‚ÄúSpirit of the Age‚Äù has been Randian since at least Reagan.  How has that worked out since 1980?
Where are all the John Galts and what does this system offer Eddie Willers??
Rand‚Äôs system is largely fantasy-fuel based on her adolescent INTJ vision of human nature.
A state that refuses to coerce pro-social economic behavior b/c ideology (or just plain corruption hidden under a Randian fig-leaf) has left the atomized, forcibly- libertarianized populace defenseless against the organized collective force of Woke Capital.
Anarcho-tyranny = Randian fiscal policy + Woke social policy.

                +1 from me, FWIW.  Voting your own side and voting party-line are almost entirely opposed strategies.
Righties who‚Äôve spent decades dissing Blacks who vote for ‚Äúmuh Democrat Plantation‚Äù despite the ruin of their hoods should consider what the GOP has done to their burbs.

                    Rogo, thank you.I have no voting strategy now, perhaps it will come.I‚Äôm just pointing out;  the ruin will rain down from above until we vote Dem, or perhaps in future RINO slate.    There will be many plagues, all of which will increase our ruin and economic repression.
COVID is decades of Economic ruin happening in weeks.  Unless you‚Äôre connected, this lesson will not be lost on anyone.

            Look at what Trump just did. His moratorium on immigration lasted what, half a day?  And in the middle of all this and what will come it will be a pathetic 10% reduction in immigration?  With 30% to 50%+ unemployment.  VXXC is right. Red is simply the rearguard of Blue, it always has been. Let‚Äôs bury the false friend so we only have one target.  We need clear battle lines and we are never going to get that as long as the GOP gets to play toy soldier. Vote Blue to bury Red.  Then maybe enough of our people will finally see things for what they are.

                I wasn‚Äôt even being accelerationist.I was saying literally we‚Äôre being forced onto the Dole cuz the Dole votes Blue.I was also saying that we‚Äôll never have a moments peace, prosperity or any normalcy while we challenge the system.No.  This is their answer; National shutdown, national welfare.Trying to be ah positive ‚Äì AherAhOrganize to fight, or give up.I don‚Äôt fear war.  I do fear welfare.Welfare? That is too much to ask.Death is inevitable, welfare is not.One is honor, the other shame.Trump had a choice during the coup of war or running the risk of waiting to be cornered.   Trump declined war and we have all gotten shame.
