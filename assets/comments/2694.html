        UKER’s summation sounds informed to my foreign ears. If it is correct, then we might say that separation is, at least, a good thing for England since they will rid themselves of that socialist coalition. And although an ever weakening Scotland may likely only seek harbor elsewhere, we can be sure that the present arrangement was reliably sucking them down. We can see the future in centralization and it is bad. We can’t see the future in separation and we are afraid.

        Scotland is apparently free to decide if it wishes to remain part of the UK, though few English people are clear why the Scots get the right to make the decision about the dissolving of the union.Scotland does, through the Barnett formula, get a bigger slice of the UK budget per head of population. They get to do various socialist things like free University education with the extra money they get. The Scots also prop up the increasingly ineffectual and corrupt Labour party with a huge slabs of socialist seats in the House of Commons. If Scotland leaves the UK there is a fair chance Wales will demand the same privilege of a referendum and if they left s well Labour will never get to form a Westminster government again.Scotland thinks North Sea oil is everything and wants it all for themselves, though interestingly when the Shetlands said they want to be independent of Scotland (after all they are more Norwegian than Scottish) the man-who-would-be-king, Salmond, got very agitated and said that would make him unhappy.There is a feeling in England that the sooner the Scots bugger off the better. There would be no more Gordon Browns for a start. We expect they will soon be scurrying to Brussels to plead to be let them into the EU, use the Euro as they cannot expect the Pound to sustain them, and thus Germany gets to approve their budgets.Personally, I think the sudden surge in ‘Yes’ voting in the polls is bad news for King Alex. The marginal No voters will rally to prove the deal is far from settled and the Yes voters may not bother with their vote thinking it is in the bag.One thing that may swing the No vote is the intervention of the Queen, though she is constitutionally obliged to stay out of politics. But a word or two to Her Majesty’s loyal Scottish subjects might show she and not King Alex is the better bet for a ruler.PS Gobsmacker, Scotland has it Muslims too. As Salmond favours socialist policies then they will want to be there for even more benefits and handouts. So there we are, they will just be another country in Europe being told to let the hordes in.

        Why would the Scots want to remain part of a Great Britain that will soon enough be dominated and run by Muslims? It was bad enough to be under the thumb of the insufferable English, but life would be intolerable for them once England succumbs to its foreign immigrants.  If Scottish culture is to survive, it must do so in a free Scotland.

        I suspect that a thoughtful person might very well vote yes, but that most of the people likely to vote yes have not the slightest idea what will happen as a result and will deplore the law of unintended consequence. But of course I would vote for the independence of the fifty states, looking forward to the consequences.
Pretty funny, though, Cameron claiming that Scotland will be more vulnerable to terrorists. Presumably they would then be free not to import them.
