        This is like saying that a man was not directly or indirectly responsible for the death of someone he did not like, but the man’s death just looked bad, so the fellow who did not like him will be convicted of murder.

            Discrimination is pretty much the entire reason and method of THINKING. Is this better, or is that? Is that ideology evil or not? Should I hang out with this group of people, or the other?Racism is surely the best example of an evolutionary adaptation that can be found. For millennia the tribes that best exploited others, and resisted exploitation themselves were the ones that prospered and spread. Efforts to expunge this behavior can only be effective against those under your rule, and will obviously result in the degradation of your own society – a DEAD END.Another dead end is to maintain your rule by the use of divisiveness. Our societies are so divided that many men and women can barely stand each other well enough for one-night stand, exploitative sex-only relationships. Resulting in badly raised children, if any.Surely some of the most amazing feats of any sh**headed ruling class ever.

                I submit for consideration that a new sect of islam would be useful for Western Civ commoners. Advantages:-Islamic divorce – “talakh” x 3 (“i’ve said it twice, woman!”).-jihad is similar to vigilantism – violence against sh**ty people screwing up your society seems needed. Muslims get special treatment at law, because they gang up and ALL get violent if not (because it’s a religious thing). Confuse axhat ruling class about the desirability of muslim immigrants .-taqiyah (lying) – useful for war, but also getting pussy: “when we were just sleeping together all those years, it was fun, but now that we’re talking marriage I have to tell you – I’m muslim, you’ll have to behave like a muslim wife”.-Christ is accepted as a prophet in islam, we could just selectively ignore mo’s ideas like any other prophet.-Allah actually refers to the same god as the judeo-christian. We’d just be using a different name (for purposes of jihad), and selecting features we like – as the other sects of islam do

                        The old testament is jewish, the new testament is a christian addition. Islam accepts christ as a prophet, but considers Mo to be the ultimate prophet.
So they’re all derived from a common base – the old testament. Islam and christianity have christ in common.

                        A fool who buys into a fiction created in the mid 20th century and thus becomes a tool of Judea.Judea defined itself in opposition to the Occident when it was under the dominion of the Hellenistic world. Judea defined itself in opposition to the Occident when it was under the dominion of the Roman world. It wandered, and it defined itself as apart and often in opposition to the post Greco-Roman world of the Germanic/Nordic European world. That was a rule and not an exception. See The Gates of Toledo and the ongoing clash through the Spanish Civil War of the 20th century as one example. See Alejandro Mayorkas and the dissolved border as another. See it carrying on with the desecration of graves and toppling of statues where this opposition carries out ancient grudges.In the end, a “judeo-Christian”, is someone who serves the subjugation and destruction of Occidental man and his dispossession of homelands in service of Judea.We are Indo-European. This is true of the Yamnaya/Bell-Beaker/Scythian epochs as well as the Hellenic, Roman and Germanic/Nordic epochs. We are defined by Dyeus Pater and his lineage of Zeus/Jupiter/Tyr/Deva. It is the line to them that trace us back to our source, back to ourselves, and back to our future and our ultimate destiny.

        My employer has solved the phantom “Gender gap” in compensation via a devilishly clever ruse. We are a huge, well-known defense contractor. As may be expected, the ranks of engineers are heavily skewed toward White and East Asian males, where a natural biological advantage exists, contrary to the wet dreams of DEI. The publicly stated goal, therefore, is to achieve a managerial class that is 50% female, regardless of talent, experience or competency.As a result, we have a chiefs-to-Indians ratio that would be unsustainable in anything other than a goobermint-subsidized industry. A veritable squaw den of useless, overpaid 30-something female ‘managers’ create daily chaos and drama, having little else to do while lording it over 50 year old quietly grumbling White male engineers.We, the vilified White males, are disappearing, a little more each year, becoming increasingly demoralized along the way. In another generation, there won’tbeany more competent White men to quietly get the job done. Is Hariq or La’Quisha or Mfumbe going to be designingand developingthe DoD’s sophisticated weapons systems under hectoring Karen’s watchful eye? C’mon, man. You know better.

                Promoting numerous young females to management positions where they have no earthly business effectively raises both the number of women in our traditionally male-only field, and pays them more than the pale male engineers under their management. Win-win for the DEI crowd. And they don’t have to reveal their lack of engineering acumen, because anyone can ‘manage’.

                    This doesn’t seem like much of a ruse, it sounds like you’ve been had.“This annoying peddler was selling his tat in the main street,very loudly,day after day. My ruse was to buy out all of his stock, so he left, having got what he wanted” -Sounds like he won, and you lost.Our ruse at an old job was that they had quotas on indigenous employees if you tendered for some contracts, mainly big gov or mining company.But there was a small org/business which would have indig people lend their name to be “employed” officially, but off the books we’d hire someone else to do the job. The official names only cost a one-off payment of a few grand or so.

            I work for a defense contractor and I’m a project manager. About a third of our engineers are white guys like myself, another third are east Asians, mainly Vietnamese and Japanese, and the others are south Asians.There are no women and only one black guy. We had some women at one point, but they were either dreadful engineers and they were either shuffled off to filing duty or they got pregnant and left the workforce, never to return. Our lone black guy is very Urkel-like and extremely competent, but he’s alone since the other ones that our HR team thought suitable to hire were complete disasters, incapable of doing the job.I honestly have no idea how they passed their certifications. When we found out how idiotic they were, they were banished to do menial projects where they could do no permanent damage. All of them left or were sacked.One of them filed a EEOC complaint against my employer, which was dismissed since the guy was fired for smoking a damned joint in the parking lot. Lovely.

                My son has same problems. Forget about minorities in engineering, they can’t even get Whites of competence. What happens then is that these guys can’t quite be fired, but are useless (unproductive) and all fellow engineers must pick up the slack or at least review their work very closely—failure equals death in their field. Indeed, two of these folk are known by nicknames given by fellow staff members: “Can’t do” and “Won’t do”.
You really have to be some sort of clueless creature to not pick up on such shortcomings within yourself.

            At my company, they actually declared a quantifiable number for “diversity”.  62% was the magic number.  In order to achieve that impossible feat they simply hired a ton of people from a certain country in south Asia that isn’t India. Well – we’ve had massive quality issues and customers are dropping like flies out in the field.  So now, my team is tasked with doing a review of the bad coding practices by these “diverse” developers to understand why we have such quality issues.
As Z always says, reality doesn’t stop coming just because you no longer believe in it.

            Indeed..My experience is that this discrimination in favor of females and blacks goes back into the ’70s at the Government level…Employees who literally couldn’t be bothered to show up for work much of the time not only retained their jobs, but were often promoted…At the corporate level, it was certainly a fact even at F500 corporations, but was more selective..We had a female VP who took 3 hour lunches to celebrate woman power..

            It’s AMAZING how many people will flip their shit if you say the blindingly obvious fact that men are more likely to be *really good* at math than women.
Doesn’t matter if you preface it with the obvious that of course not all men are better than all women at math, etc.  You are literally hitler.

        Who else thinks that in the proverbial 100 years into the future when sanity returns that people will be looking back on present-day USA and EU in disbelief ?  Assuming we still have schools and textbooks, how do they even touch on topics such as how adamant the people were to be able to abort their babies.  Imagine trying to teach that to a third grader.I think they will look to bury these embarrassments.  The truth about America will most likely be reserved for doctoral students in history.  But what historian is even going to tackle these issues honestly?Strange world we live in.  The place is so bad even the historians don’t want to involve themselves in the utter depravity and filth.Or alternatively, these things are talked about in a religious text a la Sodom and Gomorrah.  In that case, Americans will go down in history as the people who made child sacrifices in return for trinkets from a Chinaman or Jew

                        China is even more explicitly anti-white than the GAE. In fact, the latter may parrot the former at times as a form of competition. Those who read Han media and follow PRC political rhetoric assure me they are hellbent on our elimination even more than the GAE.
You do not want to live under China, either.

                            The Chinese, at least the ones running China, are anti-white, but they’re also anti-Indian, anti-Japanese, anti-African, anti-black and -brown. Though I think Sobran’s line about “humiliation” stings a little more with the Chinese, who think they are the top civilization. If they do end up on top again, I can see them looking down on us “hairy barbarians” but if European whites continue to contest them, there will be a grudging respect. I think East Asians generally like pale-skinned people anyway; at least over the alternative.

                                    Indians hate White people far more than the slopes do.At the very least they have an appreciation for the civilisation we once had.I don’t see many Indians in classical orchestras, or learning ballet, or as a tourist in Paris hopelessly trying to experience what it used to be. They’re more likely part of what’s ruined Paris.The standard meme fromEmpire of Dustis the image of the Chinese man saying “It’s all so tiresome”, but another scene has him chastising the african because of how little they appreciated what The West gave them.I experienced more ‘racism’ in South America than I ever did in China, including Argentina (let’s all move there!)

                            For sure the chicoms HATE the US and residually the UK, not sure about a general genocidal hatred for white europeans as our alien rulers have. I remember discussing the topic years ago in the context of discussing genetic research. In the US certain hard genetic facts must be denied for ideological reasons which must perforce lead to greatly retarded progress in this area of science. So it’s not only that the incompetent and incapable are elevated into roles important to geopolitical competition and even survival but also that even when scientific breakthroughs are made (in this case with regard to biological warfare) their truth and utility must be denied out of ideological fanaticism and presumably neglected in actual practice. I used to think our rulers spouted their insanities with deep cynicism in the spirit of a Machiavellian means to an end but I think they have proven at this point they have been breathing their own exhaust gasses too long and actually believe the insane and imbecile tenets of their public dogmas.

                        Well, certainly.  Consider the times (70’s).  We were in the middle of the great transition.  We were still a White country and the Boomers were taking over.  All things were possible.  70’s was a great era for those who were planning our cultural demise.  As a young man I fell for such, but so did my parents and grandparents.  Whites were that way—easy pushovers, drunk with wealth and arrogance.
Perhaps as “punishment” you should watch the movie!  😉

                When I first learned of Weimar it was presented as the final thwarted possibility of human flourishing outside communism, freedom’s last light extinguished by fascism—first Hitler’s, then the everyday fascism of “Cold War propaganda” (the average citizen’s rejection of communism). The wheelbarrows of cash were somehow roundaboutly caused by Versailles; the problem was that theyfed into Hitler’s narrative(as that would be phrased now), not that the people were impoverished. By whom? Who wanted them not to afford bread? Shut up and look at this sexy flapper. The right took this from you! Antisemitism is sexual jealousy!I went to an average American school in the ’80s, at The Height Of The Cold War™. The lone dissidentfrom communismamong the faculty and administration was a Soviet defector scientist, a space program meteorologist. The government rewarded his apostasy with a job teaching middle school geography (because…maps?) in approximately the boondocks. (Compare to the benefits, no-repayment “credit cards” and “loans,” our more welcome new refugee friends are getting.) His legacy is that a few middle aged people from one American town don’t mispronounce Russian names.Anyway, why was Hitler mad at the Jews? What facts of Weimar life led the German people to “go along” (agree) with His Madness? Who was fighting in the streets for all those years? About what? The official story of The Rise Of Hitler teaches us a lot of weird German words. Why is “Spartakusbund” not one of them? Etc. All these are secrets—paranoiac esoterica today, wholly forgotten soon.Right now, only a couple decades after the fact, if you remember that “cultural Marxist” is what many academic leftistscalled themselves, you’re insane. Wikipedia says so. Almost every electronic record in the English-speaking world has been purged to prove it. Is that memory ever coming back? Who would bring it? What for? Where would they find it? When we old men die no library will take our books, except to an incinerator. Everything must go.

                    Yes. I did academic research on Versailles and the League of Nations. It’s absolutely incredible how little the average American knows about the rise of Hitler and the Weimar period.
Anyone who cannot discuss the Bavarian Soviet, the Hungarian Soviet, the Spartacist coup, the Battle of Warsaw in 1920, the Polish Corridor, the Free City of Danzig, the Locarno treaties, the Fourteen Points, collective security, or “ethnic self-determination” knows nothing.

                        I truly wish I was better read in history. Yet, anybody who cannot utilize differential equations and transforms to build a better life should sit down and STFU. You will never create SR-71 equivalent let alone spacecraft. I could do that as GenX in the 90’s. Too many are not even aware of their own ignorance. You cannot address basic chemical and other science problems. This, the chinese can surmount.

            The current times could be considered to be a period similar to the witch-craze outbreaks that occurred in different places. There seem to be a lot of examples across the globe and across history of hysterical outbreaks, witches and otherwise. And some of these periods lasted longer than others. Ours has been occurring for an awfully long time.Unlike the American Puritan leadership of the late-1600’s, I doubt if many of today’s perpetrators will admit their mistakes and their guilt, and ask for forgiveness.Until the late-20th century when PC/Woke began to dominate, there were historians, academic and independent, who were pretty much willing to honestly tackle any subject, so I’m confident that future historians will have a field day with today’s madness, assuming academia gets back to some sort of normality in 100 years.

            We have a precedent for this.  We are 100 years from Weimar Germany and everyone just pretends the Weimar Republic was just an ordinary and normal place.  There was no insanity, Berlin was not the sex tourism capital of the world, there was no degeneracy and no moral decay.  Everyone loves talking about the book burnings, but never mention what the books were.

                Lately I do see a bit of mentioning of what the books were, by the “left.” The tranny thing has become so normalized, and seen by them as such a moral positive, that they are now becoming less afraid to point out what the books were, in an effort to show that their present day foes are the same as mustache man. I wish I could say I knew which side of that “debate” normie will come down on, but I don’t.This past July 4, I was grilling and chilling with my neighbor Civnat G. Normiecon and some of his friends, boomercons all, and one of them, for some reason unclear to me (the subject of homo adoption may have somehow been broached) took it upon herself to announce that she didn’t care what you did in your bedroom so long as you were a good citizen, or something to that effect. And nobody said anything in reply – either they were in agreement or too cowed by the new normal to pipe up. Including me, but I didn’t really know anybody there. From incidents such as this, it’s easy to get the feeling that normie will acquiesce to whatever perversion they push.

                As a younger man the most edifying descriptions I read of the Weimar vibe were by 1950s proto-shitlib Thomas Mann–  crops up in the short stories; lectures at Princeton University quite detailed about the daily corruption. There’s a short one with the perspective of a petty Teutonic aristocrat being unable to pay for household help and groceries which I think got repackaged by Regnery types as “The Witches’ Sabbath”

            Considering the path events have been taking I suspect that within a hundred years our history will have been Rewritten a couple times,  inconvenient facts and people disappeared and in general our history will be no more reliable than the Soviet Union’s at the end of their existence.

        The article is previewing this store’s future in one of the teaser headlines at the bottom, “Major retailer to close permanently in town centre.”The ruling means women such as Helen Scarsbrook, who has worked for Next for more than 20 years, are in line to receive thousands of pounds of compensation for the pay they missed out on.“We did it!” the 68-year-old from Eastleigh, near Southampton, one of the lead claimants in the case, said.“It has been a long six years battling for the equal pay we all felt we rightly deserved but today we can say we won.“Anyone who works in retail knows that it is a physically and emotionally tough job,” she said.“We do lots of heavy lifting, the same as the men do in the warehouse. We lift the same boxes they lift.”The idea that shop girls do the same amount of lifting as warehouse workers is just bullcrap on stilts. Yes, you lift the same thing. But you lift a couple a day, with long stints of less strenuous work in between, not hundreds in a row, all day.This same stupid woman, or one like her, will be quoted in the article in a few years, saying something like, “It’s just a shame the store is shutting down. I’ve worked there for decades and they were like a family to me.”

            “We do lots of heavy lifting, the same as the men do in the warehouse. We lift the same boxes they lift.”This brings to mind the blathering of some female general years back that discussing combat effectiveness “intelligence and integrity are more important in combat that physical strength.”  Well, maybe, but are women more intelligent and moral than men?Listen, sugar:  Men are just as smart as you broads, and a lot stronger.  You’re a general because we let you be, not because you are better than men.Likewise, any of the warehouse men could do the retail job, but this Helen woman would probably not make it through one work week in the ware house.

        An employment tribunal said store staff, who are predominantly women, should not have been paid at lower rates than employees in warehouses,where just over half the staff are male.
Which another way of saying “nearly half the warehouse staff are women.” I’d argue about all the ways this decision is lunacy, but I’d be preaching to the choir.

                They are currently doing that actually.https://www.uscis.gov/military/naturalization-through-military-serviceBarbarian army wasn’t just colorful language. This is literally what is happening,DEI seems to have been a very weak “upgrade” to our military strength though. Name one recent success of the US military… Somali pirate suppression maybe? I can’t really think of a good one since shock and awe bombardment of Saddam. Long time ago now and much has changed.Also…. our R&amp;D weapons programs… No matter how much fiat is printed and “cutting age military equipment” is sent to Ukraine, it still seems to be losing doesn’t it?Maybe people should start paying more attention to the replication crisis in the sciences eh? There seems to have been a pretty wide drift from the precepts of western empiricism. It’s a lot more about how the study “feels” than the empirical results of the endeavor. This is not good.The USA has become a shell of what it once was. Inflation is not going to trend better in the coming years, the housing market has not been fixed by dodd-frank and our society is more fractured than it has even been.Our ruling class is made up of fools.

I just happen to have a sense that white people of the libtard persuasion will have an awakening and come to realize that these deplorable whites are the people you want around if a hot war breaks out in Europe, so send the Juans to fight the Rooskies.
I have been wrong before of course, but this is just my hunch. As unpopular and as implausible and it sounds right now.

                                Hold on, lads, Falcone is thinking about the future.
Once we’re gone from the scene (that is, in hiding), the oversupply of wage-lowering labor will look around, notice the economy they came for is gone to squat.
What are flatlined economies like Venezuela doing? Dumping their trash to Numerica. What will Numerica do?
Dump its trash, as will all the other flatlined economies. Armies of brown conquistadors, experienced in urban warfare, will be raiding each other in a desperate bid for disappearing resources.  “In search of a better life,” ha!

                    Lots of the stuff that was sent to Ukraine isn’t that new.
The Patriot missile design was begun in 1969. Same for the concept studies that led to the F-16. The Abrams tank is comparatively young, initial design having begun in 1972.
Yes, it is possible to modernize electronics, but that only buys you so much improvement. It is also possible for modernization efforts to scope creep so much you’re essentially doing an almost totally new design.

                One unhappy future is that a lot of them will be made instant citizens after their military service. They won’t even have to learn English for various types of oh what shall we call it domestic enforcement duty?
If there’s a silver lining there it’s that these people were bottom of the Barrel in their home countries and arrival here has not improved matters. Somehow I don’t think the gang member dangerous felon released from prison on the condition that he never set foot in his home country again, will magically turn into a model Soldier after arrival here.

            Thankfully, we’re already witnessing white men choosing to tell the military to fuc$ off. The shortfall in military recruiting is solely the result of white men. All other groups have stayed consistent. It’s just white guys.
They’ve gone from 60% of recruits five years ago to 40% today. That’s huge. And it will increase. Whites don’t like being a minority. Even among white men who are thinking about joining the military, a bunch will say no when they realize that they’ll be surrounded by blacks and Hispanics.

                As a retired Air Force Reservist, I tell any young white person I encounter that are considering enlisting or becoming an officer to not join because of the anti-white bias and quality of life problems in the ranks.I also let them know that if even if you join a Reserve or National Guard unit, you’ll likely be called up to either go fight and die in some Turd World hellhole to make some financial pirate on Wall Street rich. I spent too many wasted years flying around the skies of both Iraq and Afghanistan when I could’ve been home with my family making a lot more money at my regular job.Or you will have to abandon your civilian job and life to go backfill a regular unit in Europe or Japan or even the Middle East while they get to go fight and die.Why fight for these people that despise you?

                    The only counter argument I might offer: someone entering a very highly skilled specialty. Of course that won’t protect him from general rot, but his own Elite unit would tend to resist the worst of the DEI corrosion since they usually are mission critical and screw ups are fatal.

                It’s still typhoon season out here — massive one has just hammered Kyushu and Shikoku — so give it another month or two before the sealift window opens.If the Iranians do to a carrier what the Japanese did to Prince of Wales &amp; Repulse then suppose it might be showtime, depending on just how battered American morale is.Short of massive American provocation (which is a ticking clock given the clown show in DC regardless of administration) stirring up domestic jingoist outrage in China, I reckon the PRC leadership is willing to wait things out on a longer time scale than we Westerners are used to working with.

                I don’t see the benefit of doing it now.  They’d eventually succeed, but the risk is very real that it would entail a few humiliations along the way.  Humiliations that would accrue to Xi’s scorecard.

        In Switzerland, they’re going to implement a minimum quota of 20% females on management boards which will apply to all listed companies effective starting in 2031.
Of course they don’t mention if they’re qualified or not, just as long as there’s a woman (or probably someone who identifies as a woman) in the boardroom.
They probably looked to Kamala Harris and figured if that’s good enough for the USA, then it’s good enough for Switzerland.
And this from a country that didn’t even give women the right to vote until1971.

            My crystal ball is a bit murky, but what I see is that Europe gravitates toward Russia and America recedes into its own hemisphere where it then tries to form a new hegemony (i.e. bullies) over the likes of Brazil and Costa Rica.
I think that is also the best Europe can hope for.  Its affiliations with America have been culturally catastrophic.

                The murk isn’t hurting your ability to read the ball. The early stages of that is well underway as the GAE downsizes. The Regime’s proxy war with Russia along with its treatment of Europe in the same manner as the Soviets treated its East Bloc satellites* is the first step before bugging out for new exploitation opportunities. After the Western hemisphere satrapies get uppity enough the Empire will thug rule North America alone and finally as much of its own territory as it can manage.

                    That’s awfully misogynist of you to think that women have to wear dresses. You probably think women have to have long hair, wear makeup and refrain from facial hair. I’m disgusted.
… in other words, it will be boards full of men, all indistinguishable, but some of whom check the “female” box on the forms.
Ironically, those comments about stereotypical modes of dress were a feminist line of attack against “gender stereotypes” until the trans madness came along.

                It shouldn’t be too hard to use the “identifies as” trick to meet any quota for PoC as well. Of course, we aren’t allowed to insult reality in that way… yet. Really a lot of these woke concepts remind me a bit of where religions would claim that something happened in some kind of esoteric “occluded” or “spiritually hidden” way. I believe the Jehovah’s Witnesses claimed that one of their end of the world prophesies hadn’t failed but had occurred only in the spiritual realm. There’s also the 12th Imam of the Shia who is still alive in some mystical form. Hey, if religions can do this stuff, why not use it to resolve the problems created by woke ideology?

            When you go to do research on mining companies as part of your due diligence you will see that South Africa has done this a long time ago. There are effectively two sets of management. There are the blacks on the board who have “degrees” in African studies and there are White men on the board who have advanced degrees in geo-physics, geology, physics, chemistry and decades of experience in the mining industry.Maybe the push for “diversity” that is against the lower and middle class is revenge for their wayward kids in the 60s forcing them into, “diversifying”, their boards.

And as anyone who has suffered one knows, a DIE employee becomes convinced they are beyond qualified and any errors or mistakes are made by the white folks keeping the place afloat in xher name. They tend to retire early with large compensation packets.

            Meh 🫤, I’ve related when I worked at Megabank one day my manager swept into a team meeting and reported henceforth 25% of all IT Management positions were reserved for womenfolk.
Didn’t matter if they were qualified or not, the spots were reserved just because you haters!
I left shortly afterwards. It’s a thing goin’ round. Gooder, harder, and longer.

            That kind of “forced equality/equity” is waay behind the times and assumes women are not in those boards because of simple bias or direct bigotry.  Aside from the rejection of capitalistic principle, it fails to recognize that a profit making institution will select anybody that strengthens/contributes to their corporation’s “bottom line”.
Women sit on a lot of Boards where their expertise in the appropriate markets is valued.  To require such in areas where they have no expertise is simply disruptive.

Cases like this make it impossible to run anything. It would literally be easier for there to be utter lawlessness and finding out who to bribe to keep in business. Even mafias weren’t this arbitrary.

            A constant source of frustration to me is that my fellow Americans can’t seem to understand that they are not morally obligated to go along with insanity.  I watch them behave like lambs being led to slaughter – when resistance would be easy with just a little thought and a microgram of courage.  We all need to learn the ways of subversion and hidden noncompliance.In ‘developing’ country I often visit, and hope to retire in, the locals make sport of thwarting the laws they don’t like.  That’s how I got my “proof” of vaccination – I’m in the govt computer system and everything – for a measly few bucks.  That country has enforcemect tools like computers and bureaucracy and cops and whatnot just like us.  But they also have developed a culture of noncompliance with rules that run contrary to their individual interests.There’s no legal solution within the current US system.  If we can’t muster street armies to defend us (next best option), then all I see as an alternative is to cooperate with each other in nullifying the system’s dictates.

            I know you were joking but that wouldn’t be the first time some regulatory insanity had unintended consequences that hurt everyone. In this case, if the business wasn’t looking at automating either the retail floor or the warehouse before, they probably are now. If it’s a privately held company the owner(s) might also be looking to sell it to some corporate raiders who will break it up and sell off the assets.I sometimes wonder if the real purpose of this kind of stuff is just to make going into business so full of bullshit that people will prefer to work for the government or some huge corporation.

        When you look at what is coming out of the law schools lately, you realize you haven’t seen anything yet. The presumption of abundance endemic to the western managerial class permits haughty, unqualified apparatchiks to “reimagine” the economy and any other thing they want to “reimagine” not only in good conscience, but in arrogant certainty inversely proportional to their ignorance. It’s the same impetus that impels them to mandate everyone drive an electric car when such a thing is not possible.Part of the problem is allowing ourselves to be ruled by lawyers who have never had real jobs, often any jobs. Back when I used to think voting mattered, I always voted for the non lawyer, if there was one. This was how I rationalized, at the time, voting for McCain and Romney. But you can see that the situation is too far gone for that to have been a solution. Anymore than voting for the non lawyer this November will be a solution.

            Law school requires an undergraduate degree.  The problem is a large percentage of those undergrad degrees are useless (poli sci being a big one).  They can do nothing else with the BA, so they go to law school.  The ones with decent undergrad degrees (business, engineering) usually end up as tax lawyers, business lawyers or patent lawyers.  It is usually the poli sci ones that go into politics.

                The lawyers, through the State Bar, got together in the 60‘s to change State law in many States.  Prior, for example, AZ had a simple requirement to only pass the Bar exam to practice.  This was justified ostensibly to create better/well trained lawyers.
Now that law schools are “poz’d” and they are graduating more and more “Kamala Harris types”—those who can’t pass a State Bar exam—the Bar Association is doing away with it.  So much for caring about the quality of their practicing lawyers.

        I swear, when read or see so many of these “news” stories or hear some people talk, I’m thinking how can they believe this s*** or even pretend to believe it?  And if they do, how are things still functioning properly for the most part?  The real problem with this new religion is it’s not some wacko fringe group that everyone else can pretty much ignore, it’s shoved down our throats by our rulers – don’t believe your lying eyes or ears or else….  It’s getting harder not to occasionally question your own sanity.

        Why in God’s good name are they comparing warehouse work to retail work in the first place?  Most warehouses have no heat and no air.  It’s hard work. It involves operating machinery. Women are not lining up to do this kind of work.Retail involves standing around in a heated and air conditioned retail store, talking to customers and probably tracking inventory and putting items on the shelf.
The idea that job x and job y should pay the same because it is the same company is ridiculous. It’s worse than communism.

        Don’t worry. The stock market is due for a crash, especially with Tech having run out of ideas (AI simply being vaporware).The crash will force reality upon many people.No doubt these judges have investments in the stock market and as the prices go up their confidence in their internal delusions go up as well. As the prices collapse by 80% and more, their confidence will collapse as well.Make no mistake about it. Reality is King of Everything and it is coming back to reclaim its throne. And there will be much pain along the way for the assholes who pushed Reality out.

        All the loose talk about creating a new religion misses the fact that we have a new religion, the religion of the managerial class.
I’d say it’s the religion of feelings, and we know what sex is big on feelings. The same sex that has the vague feeling that something is wrong. I don’t KNOW what’s wrong, it just seems wrong and Ifeelit’s wrong, so we have to “fix” it.
It’s the same sex that has the worldview “Ihave a problem with something soNO ONEcan have it and enjoy it.”

        Yes to all of this. What cannot go on forever, will not go on forever. Eventually the plates stop spinning and reality reasserts itself. But what follows is typically an abrupt and severe transition period. The Soviet Union collapsed in 3 days followed by nearly 2 decades of misery. The equivalent in the West is being deliberately engineered to be sudden and violent, which is the role of the illegal invaders. The ensuing chaos and bloodshed spawns a call for government intervention, which quickly morphs into a techno-tyranny. We trade freedom for serfdom in the new Matrix. We can defeat this with focus and finality.

        “In the new normal, you can be guilty of violating a rule or law, even if you did not actually violate the rule or law, simply because the rule or law is not getting the intended result.”That is the core legal foundation (lol) of every single Trump court case.  Nothing illegal happened, and so he will be charged and convicted of crimes because that is the desired result.The Eagles have a great song from the early 1990’s (Get Over It) which contains the line, borrowed from Shakespeare, “The more I think about it, old Billy was right, let’s kill all the lawyers, and kill ‘em tonight.”My company had to hastily write a diversity plan recently because somebody noticed we don’t have enough vibrancy.  No laws were broken.  The company is very successful.  Our crime?  Mostly white men, and the women we have in the C-suite are highly competent and white.My HR Director is pretty squarely in the camp of Team Sanity.  It was killing him to have to write that garbage.

        The other day, 200 Bush/Romney/McCain flunkies endorsed Kum-ala. That tells you everything you need to know about the GOP. Party loyalty is only a one-way street to them. They don’t represent us, they represent DC.That’s another violation of the norms we’ve been operating under and it is absolutely telling.I posted this on another page and somebody else made a pretty good observation. There are no Reagan admin officials in that 200. It’s all Bush/Romney/McCain uniparty.I don’t despise the Bushes or Romney (although I do despise McCain). I do despise their system, however. As Vladimir Putin once said, not much difference between the way the United States operates and the former Soviet Union.

            Yep.  Don’t forget folks, the Rep’s made a big show of passing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act half a dozen or so times.  McCain voted for it as well.  Every time it meant nothing–and the Rep’s knew this–with Obama in the WH.  It was all show for the rubes.  As soon as Trump came in with complete Congressional control, McCain reversed himself and killed the repeal bill in the Senate. And now the old guard Rep’s decry the “Trumpists” for their lack of cooperation in primaries.  Trumpists are so mean calling them “RINO’s”.  🙂

        First, look at that “woman” they have pictured over at the article.
Second, this gem is from the article:
“There have already been cases in the public sector over lower pay for workers, including teaching assistants and dinner ladies paid less than men employed in refuse collection and similar roles.”
So walking miles and miles every single day, rain or shine, heat or freezing while chucking refuse bags into trash trucks should pay the same as a teaching assistant or “dinner ladies!!!”  UnFreakingReal!

        Some religious beliefs are reality-neutral: they have no direct implications for human action. Unfortunately, the new religion’s central beliefs are not reality-neutral, but actively opposed to reality. They’re based on four main errors:“The moralistic fallacy:morality determines reality.This assumes that whatever seems morally desirable must be true. If something is undesirable, it must be false.The realistic fallacy:reality determines morality.This assumes that whatever seems true must also be moral.The rationalistic fallacy:if it seems to make sense, it’s true.This assumes that whatever seems to make sense must be true, even if there’s no evidence for it.The existentialist fallacy:if you want it to be true, then it is.This assumes that reality is whatever you want it to be. It is loosely suggested by the philosophy of existentialism, which argues that people must define the meaning of their own lives. It’s also a kind of ‘get out of jail free’ card to justify the other fallacies. For example, it enables 52-year-old men to claim that they are six-year-old girls and make everyone else pretend to believe it.”Why Sane People Believe Crazy Things

                For the last couple decades, I’ve often wondered what happens if we wake up tommorow to news of the discovery of cheap, limitless energy, cold fusion or something else?  Whither the entire Middle East?  What happens to a Russia no longer able required to be a gas station?
After everything sorts itself out, I’d think the biggest winners would be the East Asian countries and, unfortunately, these United States, which would have time to double down on its cultural hegemony.

        The new managerial religion must have some foreign elements in it, given that an increasing chunk of the upper echelons of the managerial class are aliens from the Indian subcontinent. The Christian element is naive and influenced by vulgar Judaism. Also an important part of the mix is simple ethnic self interest of the various foreign groups that are being imported.

        The issue with the faith of our betters is that it does not scale down. Very few of the Dirt People believe it, as it offers them nothing, as being the wrong race and status they will never ascend to the Clouds anyway. The exception of course being Karens who love affirming the powerful.Meanwhile Christianity offers nothing for most White Dirts, though any examination of the Christian Graffiti in places like Downey and Santa Fe Springs (heavily Latino) it certainly DOES offer something to Dirts of Hispanic heritage. The guy “Kulak” on Substack, Anarchonomicon, has a couple of articles equating the wages of Christ with Cuckdom. He does have some fairly cogent points on that matter.I do think there is a folk religion being born, among White Dirts. It seems to be some sort of White Shintoism. Judaism is of course exclusionary, as is Islam. The one wants exclusivity, the other wants to make the Whites, Dirts or Clouds, slaves or worse. The dog not barking is the total lack of White men converting to Islam in Europe or here. The various paganisms have no real connection and look stupid. But worship of real and imaginary past heroes, particularly as all the people White men HATE HATE HATE try to destroy them: the Rainbow Saguaro, Karens galore, various mystery meat theys, angry Muslimas, and Islamic Rage Boys — that must mean that Robert E. Lee, George Washington, and Luke Skywalker were onto something. Ditto Captain Kirk, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Teddy Roosevelt. The Alamo, and a few other places are already like Shintoist shrines to White dudes, which is why our enemies destroy them when they can.Its as much a reaction to the Holiness among the elite to the Sacred Taste The Rainbow. [Which apologies to Skittles has a whole other meaning now.]

Very few of the Dirt People believe it, as it offers them nothing, as being the wrong race and status they will never ascend to the Clouds anyway.”This is a feature, not a bug, of the neo-Calvinist Woke religion.  The anti-white blood libel of racism limits competition from the striver cohort of Dirt People whites.  Those Dirty whites uppity enough to think they can rise above their rightful station will remain in the Dirt People caste and that’s where they’ll forever stay…for the unforgivable sin of being born white and working class.

        “For those familiar with American discrimination law, this may sound like disparate impact, “I think you missed the boat on this one, Z-man—but your interpretation seems valid as well.  It eerily sounds like “Equal pay for equal work”, or more aptly “comparable worth” or “pay equity”. This concept first floated in the 1980’s and I believe stemmed from the 2nd wave Feminists. (Maybe 3rd wave, who the hell keeps track?)The idea behind comparable worth was to address wage disparities by comparing the value of different jobs based on skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions, rather than simply the market rate. It aimed to ensure that jobs typically held by women were compensated at the same level as jobs of comparable value typically held by men. In the present example, simply substitute the broader classification of “minorities” for “women”.I believe it was Reagan who commented to the effect that this idea was ‘had more lunacy than a Loonie Tune’s cartoon’. The idea was so ridiculed that in died in Congress before being proposed as law.Seems the Leftists are running out of new ideas. Progress?

            Yes. Exactly that.  The article talks about how a successful suit in the public sphere means teaching assistants and dinner ladies should be paid the same as trash collectors as if these jobs were in any way comparable.  The teaching assistant and dinner lady jobs are so preferable to the trash collector that there needs to be a large increase in pay to take the trash collector job.  What few women were working in trash collecting will now desire a transfer to the teaching assistant or dinner lady job.It is absolute insanity even worse than communism.  I didn’t think such a thing were possible.  Not even the evil commies thought there was no pay enhancement for a difficult and dirty job vs a clean and easy job.  As if following a trash truck in 100 degree heat or 10 freezing in the rain or snow is somehow the same as being a teaching assistant or dinner lady.  MADNESS!

        But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of desire will enter his mind. He will become an outspoken advocate of lust, calling it the Way to Bodhi. He will teach his lay followers to indiscriminately engage in acts of lust, calling those who commit acts of lust his Dharma heirs.The power of spirits and ghosts in the Ending Age will enable him to attract a following of ordinary, naive people numbering one hundred, two hundred, five or six hundred, or as many as one thousand or ten thousand. When the demon becomes bored, it will leave the person’s body. Once the person’s charisma is gone, he will run afoul of the law. He will mislead living beings, so that they fall into the Relentless Hells. Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.SHURANGAMA SUTRAIn Eastern philosophy, who ever calling out fulfillment of sexual desire are the devilfrom Aleister Crowley to Rajneesh the hippie master, all kinds of sex liberation movement sweep over westits direct condemnation on logos and praise primitive desire as basis of lifeI believe early 20 century sex movement is also Jewish PSYOP to destroy traditional European value and promote mental deterioration on European

        It is a good example of two things we see with the new religion we see with the managerial classes in the West.The religion is not new during our lifetimes. Alisa Rosenbaum wrote about it inAnthem, a story published in the 1930’s, and the religion wasn’t new then, either. Here’s a passage from Part One which helps to explain the origins of the dystopia she conjured up in her imagination:We [Equality 7-2521] strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be alike. Over the portals of the Palace of the World Council, there are words cut in the marble, which we repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted:“WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE. THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT WE, ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER.”See also the founding documents of the USA for these themes.

            Star Trek (original series) took a different approach to the egalitarian, secularist heaven. Rodenberry’s interstellar space communism is a eutopia (good place) with no money (for most), few shortages, harmonious equality, excellent management, and efficient assignment of labor to roles and jobs. There’s scant dissent and no mention whatever of the gulag planets needed to make the United Federation of Planets work without killing dissidents shortly after they are discovered. It’s insidious propaganda now almost 60 yrs old.

                The real insidiousness of Star Trek was in the white alpha male character getting all the exotic poontang. This was the ploy that sold the concept to white males who otherwise might have been repelled by this preposterous futuristic vision.

        Same as it ever was?  Your readers – might enjoy a philosophical analysis of one particular strand of history.  I commend this on to your attention.  It’s ominous.I’m re-readingThe Ominous Parallels(Piekoff, bought hardcover for $7 in 1985)If you understand the EU mentality transplanted here by Dewey’s writings in the 1890’s, all of the Continuing Crises, there and here, seem perfectly logical.I’m on page 185(hc) and the man with the mustache just showed up at the beer hall.As to the fUSA, after a century of marketers saturating the culture with Menticide, it’s not surprising to see our Overlords becoming afflicted with Desmet’s Psychoses.  From your observations of their AntiMorality, it looks like they’ve long ago drowned in the Luna Sea.Where’s the “kinder, gentler” Xirl Xcience when we need it?
