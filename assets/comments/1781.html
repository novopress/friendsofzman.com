        Since the Depression, I can only think of one candidate who ran and won the Presidency as VP.

            Look at the ones who won the nomination. VP’s, when they run, almost always win the nomination. Dan Quayle is the only failure. Gore, Bush, Mondale, Humphrey, Nixon all won their party’s nomination when they ran for it. The sample size is small and who knows what would have happened if the other VP’s had run. The benefits of being the VP within the party are substantial. If he runs, Biden will have instant credibility making it easier for him to raise money and build a ground game. Only Cankles has those advantages.
