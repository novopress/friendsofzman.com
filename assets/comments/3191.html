        I saw a very snide piece on Facebook, aimed at Ted Cruz, about net neutrality. Of course, they were in favor of it and acted like they thought Cruz was some sort of a retard and in the pay of corporations for opposing it.I work for an ISP. I have worked for Netflix, whose business model is to say that everyone else needs to support their product. I have no sympathy for Netflix as they treat their employees like crap (at least the lower level ones).  And I get very tired of people trying to tell us there is a problem with our internet service, when the problem is with Netflix or the fact they have 12 devices sucking up their bandwidth.Let Netflix build their own damn infrastructure. The telcos may also be assholes, but at least they spent their money to build the networks.

        and don’t forget the practical issues:
if all packets are to be treated equally then the pipe to any customers  house must be sized for the maximum bandwith and the ISP must have the capability to keep each pipe full. I think that no one can afford this.
If, as the government says, unlimited internet means unlimited then only one person at a time can have unlimited service but, before that happens, ISPs will fare worse than the dogs that tried to drink the ocean.
