        Based on what I‚Äôve seen living in a solid-blue DC-area county, a bedroom suburb for Feds and the Fed-adjacent‚Ä¶ One reason they don‚Äôt do second-order thinking is that they‚Äôre insulated from second-order consequences.  The Federal government isn‚Äôt going to go out of business or move somewhere else.  Given a solid-blue electorate, there‚Äôs alsonopoliticalcost.So there‚Äôs none of the discipline or constraints normally imposed by real life cost/benefit.

                Yes, but eventually the lack of accountability catches up with them. Collapsing empires, an absolute refusal for reform, and a summary justice known as the brick wall and the firing squad, usually catches up with them.

                    Matt Bracken, I think, had an old short story ‚ÄúWhat I Saw at the Revolution‚Äù that is pretty prescient and has a satisfying ending. It shows the total lack of second order thinking of those kind.

                This is the best essay I‚Äôve yet read from Z.He‚Äôs channeling his inner H L Mencken.It‚Äôs neither firmly comedy, nor firmly ridicule; oddly enough, it‚Äôs more at mere simple [and rather tautological] observations about the surrealistic lunacy of the so-called managerialists.I can‚Äôt tell whether the UK Thunderbirds ever made it to an hollowed-out volcano [back in the 1960s], although apparently they had to deal with an ackshual active volcano in Iceland¬†[the 14th episode of Season 2].https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbirds_(TV_series)But Mike Myers had anhollowed-out volcano in ‚ÄúAustin Powers‚Äù.And I believe Sean Connery visited an hollowed-out volcano in ‚ÄúYou Only Live Twice‚Äù.

            The Cartoon Network view of the federal bureaucracy which conservatives cherish and bring with them into dissident politics is only half right about half of the time.In my experience, there is little difference between public and private when it comes to planning in very large organizations.  Tiggers are always priviledged over Eyeores, even when the Eyeores are proved correct time and again.  It‚Äôs theHammerstein-Equord matrix in reverse.Part of this does has to do with the fact that suggesting that something might go wrong is viewed as a direct criticism of decision-makers, who will never be held accountable for failure.  Failure is not an option, because failure never happens.  I have witnessed an actual flaming wreck involving injuries be declared a positive outcome due to ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù (never spelled out) and the expected future ‚Äúsafety benefits‚Äù it would bring.  This was during operations, mind you.  Not in the lab or a field trial.It‚Äôs like the reported Biden family reaction to the debates: they simply dusted off the excuses made by the Reaganoids in 1984.  The problem wasn‚Äôt a failing brain in a senile hack.  It wasover-preparation, you see?Another part has to do with the presence of females.  This is biology, not bitch-bashing.  In the supposedly glorious before times, the eager-to-please-power-at-all-costs male minion was seen as weak and untrustworthy by the competent.  Females, on the other hand, are biologically wired to please.  As organizations become more feminized, pleasing soundmakers are promoted.  In this, DEI is simply a failure enhancement mechanism.  Put together and you get the current US general officer corps, a bargeful of sycophantic losers.I know very little about the biology or psychology of second-order thinking, especially its relationship to intelligence, sex and personality.  But my own experience suggests that time spent online appears to erode the ability to think in those terms.

                Vegetius: ‚ÄúI know very little about the biology or psychology of second-order thinking, especially its relationship to intelligence, sex and personality. But my own experience suggests that time spent online appears to erode the ability to think in those terms.‚ÄúWhen I searched on ‚ÄúSecond-order thinking‚Äú, I got the following: ‚ÄúSecond-order thinking is amental model that considers all future possibilities. It encourages individuals to think outside of the box so that they can prepare for every and any eventuality. It also discourages the tendency for individuals to default to the most obvious choice.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I spend all day long [and often all night long], every day [and often every night] doing nothing but reverse-engineering the V@xxpocalypse and the impending WWIII and figuring out how we can survive whatever the hell it is that the Globalist Depopulationists are planning to send our way next.I‚Äôm juggling so many possible futures in my head right now that my frigging skull is about to explode.Without saturation reading you guys &amp; Gab &amp; /pol/ &amp; various WordPress sites, and even just plain-old fashioned Free Republic, and Karl Denninger [God bless his heart], I wouldn‚Äôt know anything about any of this stuff.Can you imagine having faced the V@xxpocalypse, back in late 2020 [and early 2021], without any knowledge whatsoever of the insider leaks, from Pfizer &amp; Moderna, to /pol/, concerning the Lipid Nanoparticles attacking the ovaries &amp; the testes?How can Normies NOT take advantage of this voluminous overwhelming library of Depopulationist crimes which we have catalogued here in the Dissident Right?

            That pretty much explains the whole mental outlook of the Left: lack of immediate consequences. Our grandfathers built us a very strong society that can take a lot of damage, including the insanity foisted on us by these maniacs. That means they can say, ‚ÄúSee? What‚Äôs the big deal if we redefine marriage/run up trillions of debt/open the borders? The wheels are still turning!‚Äù However, that is now coming to an end as the system at last begins to break down. The Main Meal of Consequences is about to be served to the Left and to us.

        If you magically merged the best of Calvin Coolidge, Reagan and Trump into one and ran against an even more severely demented and drooling Biden, it would still be a close race, even without cheating. That‚Äôs just where we are now and for the most part have been for a long time. The distracted amoral American dumbass is of no use to good people hoping and working for a better country.

            Prior to 2000 or so, close elections were the exception. Now they are the norm, and today if somebody gets 53% like The Precious did, that‚Äôs considered a mandate, whereas in the before times, a long time often passed between presidential elections as close as that one in 2008.
I note that the always close presidential elections coincide with the ubiquity and increased efficiency of computing power. Although they also track with the GR.

                A conspiracy among the Democrat operatives is shaping up because it has to. Here‚Äôs the least-bad alternative for Dems operating behind the curtain. They use that computing power to fortify democracy again and reelect Biden/Harris. This is in lieu of Biden dropping out prematurely, which he won‚Äôt because he‚Äôs an angry senile old man. Then the 25th amendment machinery is set into motion and we get a President Harris. If the plebs haven‚Äôt revolted after four years of Biden, why would they do so if Harris succeeds to the throne? The puppet show continues, Judy replacing Punch, thus forestalling the chaos of a Trump presidency within which the prosecutions begin (so they fear).

The secret to the messianic religious zealots (looking at you, JudeoPuritans) is that capitalof all kindsis diverted from practical to social issues.
From masculine practicality to feminine sociality;from the engineers to the priesthood.

                Lefties do not see those images. This is something that really didn‚Äôt dawn on me until a few others pointed it out. When you are in highly curated and restricted echo chamber you don‚Äôt see these images and hear him mumbling, see him stumbling.This was raw and unedited so lots of leftists who have been deeply in the haze of propaganda caught an unfiltered glimpse of it for the first time. Certainly not the high-priests at CNN, MSNBC, etc. who were acting equally surprised. But probably a statistically significant amount of far leftists have never seen ‚Äòraw Biden‚Äô prior to this event because it is kept so radically filtered.

            The liberals that I know are hardly troubled by Biden‚Äôs condition and will vote for him again.¬†They are eager to cast a vote for the shadowy group that controls Biden, even if they aren‚Äôt sure who actually makes the decisions.They‚Äôd prefer another Obama, who was ‚Äúarticulate and bright and clean,‚Äù but they see their vote for Biden as support for the sanctity of abortion and the dispossession of traditional whites via massive immigration, affirmative action, and crippling climate change restrictions.In other words, they feel that their highest duty is to oppose the sort of people who read this blog.For the liberals that I know, Biden‚Äôs senility is about as troubling to them as Trump‚Äôs ‚Äústaple green cards to the diplomas of foreigners‚Äù was to Trump worshippers.

                LITS,
A good and concise analysis. As with most Leftists, they‚Äôll really be voting for what they‚Äôreagainst(i.e., white tradition), as opposed to what they‚Äôrefor.
Most Leftists I‚Äôve known simply cast votes along these ideological lines. They really do get swept up in it. You name the hysteria: Climate change, Covid, migrant ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù, etc.; they‚Äôll lap it up.
Same with most Conservative types, too.

                    They‚Äôre replaying the same game on us in Ohio this year. The ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù candidate, is the scion of a powerful Colombian political family and he was born in Bogota.

        Not enough credit is being given.We‚Äôre talking about the same folks who in 2020 staged a domestic color revolution and subsequent fortification. Who from 2016-2018 staged the great Russia Hoax, which had multiple second and third order effects which furthered their future imperial plans.However, for the great mass of followers, hopelessly infected by the mind virus at both the micro short term and macro long term levels, the people who one day spelled it Kiev and the next day Kyiv, who one season scaremongered about the jab because it was coming from Trump and the next season cheerleaded it because it was coming from Biden, these people, probably to include the NYT editorial board, are well described by Zman‚Äôs essay today. No doubt a great many of them believed in Biden on Thursday and then were opposed to him on Friday. Because that‚Äôs what their sail foams told them.But they are not in charge, and they are not making the decisions.

            But they are not in charge, and they are not making the decisions.
That‚Äôs the bottom line. While it will change nothing, the Nursing Home Beauty Pageant and Debate made it clear to even to many thick-skulled Americans that they are powerless and their political choices are irrelevant. It is why I get a kick out of people claiming the Ruling Class‚Äôs lawn jockey, Barack Obama, also is in the volcano and plotting. Obama barely functions as a dutiful crack whore, for God‚Äôs sake.

                Don‚Äôt discount the Intelligence asset; that‚Äôs why he was rewarded with Kalomara Castle two miles from the White House, instead of a volcano lair.This guy is our Lenin; the Kagan clan is our Trotsky.As an Alinkskyite community organizer, this guy is very good at his job, hobnobbing and liasing connections. Networking is his business.He stole $150 million from a dead Republican and gave it to Ayers in the Annenberg Challenge.He took thirty hippies of ACORN- Arkansas Community Organizers for Reform Now- and turned it into the national ‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô CORN army of 300,000 that converged the public sector unions of SEIU and AFSCME. This put the Clintons at the top of Chicago‚Äôs DSA (Democrat Socialist Alliance) and the billionaire oligarchs‚Äô secretive Democracy Alliance.He forced mighty Bank of America to cough up $1 billion as a technician for the Clintons; then the other banks followed suit, kowtowing to the CRA, and his fellow travelers at Fannie Mae made millions for themselves and billions for their masters.(Ushering in the $2 trillion dollar short of the ABS derivatives index which gave us the Mortgage Meltdown, Obama the Presidency, and up to $43 trillion stolen for the globalist ruling class.)He was courted by 11 bubble billionaires in Palo Alto to deliver to them the contracts for the surveillance state, and promised a Presidency if he delivered.He delivered, and Bush‚Äôs TIA data-mining program became a comprehensive ballot machine database that evolved into the basis for CBDC digital ID‚Äôs.He networked the ‚Äúgolf circuit‚Äù- all those lazybones golf vacations!- each trip conveniently near a gay Democrat billionaire‚Äôs home, effectively working the queer underground into a political behemoth.He shaped the Clyburn Black Democrat ballot harvester machine being run thru the AME black churces; this network is the backbone getting blacks and communists elected to municipal and state positions everywhere with Soros money. As well as ‚Äú81 million votes‚Äù for his former Vice President.Look, this Intel asset- trained since childhood as a rentaboy and an asset- is pissed at what his makers did to him. He is key to the fundamental transformation, and driven by inner fury. We only assume he is lazy because he‚Äôs black; well, Mugabe, Mandela, and Amin were black and lazy too.

                    Very good run down on the manufactured black Jesus.The Obama Foundation never rests, as it peppers its progressive feel-good rallies with Julia Roberts, Clooney and his intel asset lawyer wife, and other big draw morons. They run huge presentations all over the world.  Check out their website ‚Äì it‚Äôs a massive propaganda machine cranking out materials for audiences of all levels of intelligence. They‚Äôre now stepping into entertainment. IOW, they‚Äôre expanding the hateYT franchise, worldwide. (As an aside, it hasn‚Äôt occurred to people that Johnny Depp and Dolly Parton, for example ‚Äì celebs generally known to be decent people in their private lives, aside from their TDS ‚Äì  sh*t all over their fans when they dump on Trump. Who does Dolly think bought her albums all these years?)I‚Äôd also add Obama introduced three other major nation-wrecking policies. First was weaponizing agencies against political opponents (IRS and the DOJ with Holder‚Äôs help). Second, creating the ‚Äúdisparate impact‚Äù concept.  And third, but probably the most ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù, was rolling out the ‚ÄúPeople of Color‚Äù concept which instantly expanded and united the progressive umbrella. And just in the nick of time, as the Trump victory showed that they didn‚Äôt quite have the numbers they needed for their coalition of misfits to take power indefinately. (Hence the current panic to get that border open as wide as possible.)  ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù turned a Jamaican-Indian Kamala into black, just like that!Obama turned the progressive state into the progressive police state.

                    I am convinced Obama is a master ofericksonian talking hypnosis, and thus has the ability to implant subconscious suggestions into a sympathetic audience ‚Äì he bypasses their conscious thought processes by droning on with platitudes till the feeble brains of (D)irtbag voters stop resisting his evil ideas.

                In sum, it matters not who is installed, because this is what ‚Äúminders‚Äù working in conjunction with the bureaucracy‚Äôs overwhelming institutional inertia are for. Decisions are made by the Cabal, and their dictates are accommodated by either pushing the desired Executive Orders under the pen of a ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù compliant with these Decisions, or by having the Bureaucracy just ignore the wishes of a ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äù no matter what he even signed (rather like those kiddie car seats with a steering wheel which controls nothing).

        A perfect snapshot of murka in 2024.  A 74 year old White man, in small town (7k) Crete, Nebraska (sw of Lincoln) shot (only wounded) 7 mestizos, part of a larger group having a loud party next door.  He also told them to go back to their own country and to learn English.  Then he killed himself.In 2000, Crete was 86% White and 13% mestizo.  Today, it is 42% mestizo (White % is unclear because they include the mestizos and others in the %).  The local public school ‚Äòchildren‚Äô are 62% mestizo.  And they all agree the White man was an evil rayciss who ought to be dead and replaced.But people here still discuss the expansion of the franchise, or the evils of democracy over a republic.  They still think that stopping immigration now will save murka.  Trump thinks ‚Äòlegal‚Äô immigration is great.  He made a point of calling the mestizo mother of the mestizo killed by the Venezuelan mestizo, because mestizos who‚Äôve squatted on magic dirt a bit longer are now magic murkans.Hey, it‚Äôs the most important election ever.  Because we have to save the country so that Juan and Suneel and Deshawn can know that their votes matter.

            I will say, the White mind lends itself to apocalyptic solutions. Having lost his town and finally his own home to savages, he commits suicide rather than engage in any of the alternatives possible to him. (No, not like voting or a petition. How dare you?)But something in the White soul craves a desperate last stand against impossible odds. There is a reason why Theoden‚Äôs harangue in ‚ÄúReturn of the King.‚Äù‚ÄúRide now! Ride for ruin and the world‚Äôs ending! Death! Death!‚Äù And all the White kids in the theater feel their epigenetic souls stirring: where can I get such magic?But that doesn‚Äôt serve us here. The tools proper to our age are more those of the cosa nostra, or the times of the Troubles. Heroic and impossible last stands are the wrong tools. But how could an old man possibly be expected to grasp that?

            I‚Äôm absolutely sympathetic to this guy‚Äôs plight. He has likely seen that neighborhood terraformed into little Central America in short order. As you well know, this is happeningeverywhere.I saw it with my own eyes on my ‚Äúwalkabout‚Äù last summer driving across this once great nation. These are the poor bastards that inherit all that wonderful ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù that leftists nicely shelter themselves from while screeching the loudest about it.You see it all around DC, I am sort of numb to it now since I‚Äôm only here for a brief stint and I‚Äôm totally disconnected from the States mentally, but it DOES exist. I took a couple recent Uber rides in the ‚Äòburbs around DC. Little El Salvador. These were neighborhoods I grew up and all the signs are in Spanish now. Little goblins and nuggras are all you see now and I‚Äôm talking about WAY out past the DC line deep into the ‚Äòburbs.This is why the rich lefties now have to hoof it from NoVA (Reston, Ashburn, etc.) because their pets are breaking through the containment fences and outbreeding them, prolifically so. My own neighborhood is full of people just like this guy had to deal with. Mystery meats from all around the world speaking a myriad of unintelligible languages as LOUDLY as possible because the world is your oyster when you have an 80IQ. A mix of Whitoids remaining myself sadly included for the time being.  My ‚Äòhood is probably sub 40% white now and shrinking rapidly.

        The debate was a called bluff.  Biden‚Äôs staff worked with CNN to produce a debate offer with debate rules that were ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù to be declined by Trump so that Biden etal. could use the ‚ÄúTrump is too afraid to debate‚Äù tactic.  Of course, there is no second level thinking involved in this just like bad poker players never think about what happens if they have to show the busted flush.

            Great insight!  That also explains why Trump went along with all the one sided rules.  I thought he was just phoning it in and was too lazy or cocky to demand better rules, but he probably realized it was the only way to get a debate.  It‚Äôs hilarious how most of the rules turned out to be neutral or helpful for him.

        This inability or unwillingness to think about the consequences of actions is a hallmark of the New Left. With the possible exception of the French and Russian revolutionaries, no group in history has effected as thoroughgoing a demolition of society as has the New Left. But whereas the former two groups took a rototiller only to their own nation, the New Left took it to the entirety of western civilization and did so without any thought to what might happen if you ripped out, by the roots, the totality of custom and tradition, institutions and structures, and then dashed kerosene on the ensuing blazes by importing hordes of Third World savages. For some reason it never seems to have occurred to them that the results might be slightly unpleasant.Then again, perhaps they did. Perhaps New Leftists are agents of unclean forces whose job is simply to annihilate and then observe the holocaust. And maybe that explains the strange case of Joey Depends. His handlers simply take delight in ruining the federal government and watching the bewildered consternation of the masses. It‚Äôs all part of the sadistic, nihilistic plot.

        They don‚Äôt possess second-order thinking because they don‚Äôt have to. Nobody ever got fired in DC for being wrong, or arguing bad policy. They don‚Äôt have to perform at their jobs because they don‚Äôt get fired, and their home values in NOVA keep going up no matter what the economy is doing, and they get a pension at the end so they don‚Äôt even need to plan for their retirement. They don‚Äôt see the world in even ‚Äúgreat game‚Äù terms, as moves on a chessboard ‚Äì they think they are the chessboard. It is how we end up with a Secretary of Treasury that can‚Äôt manage the economy, a Secretary of State that cannot conduct diplomacy, a Secretary of Homeland Security that can‚Äôt control the homeland borders, an Attorney General that cannot enforce the law, and so forth. They believe in sorcery and magic and believe that they create reality.They‚Äôve been managing Biden since 2020, when a color revolution instead of an election put him into power, so why couldn‚Äôt they keep doing it? Yet, we are now at the point where reality has infringed upon the world of their making, where his degenerative decline is too much and too fast to be denied and managed. They are not going to just voluntarily release their grip on power, though. The next few months will be interesting, and maybe evenn funny ‚Äì I‚Äôm betting on a stinky diaper moment myself, hopefully at the 2nd debate where Trump can go gloves off.

        One interesting feature of that mediocrity is a pernicious ‚Äúflocking‚Äù behavior in these erstwhile elites. The flock flies north, then suddenly flies south, but no member has any idea why.  First the flock demanded the removal of Biden, suddenly and as if on cue.  Then over the weekend seemed to switch to all the reasons Biden ‚Äúreally won‚Äù or is vigorous (he read a few 5 minute statements from a teleprompter without falling over or crapping himself).  One thing I‚Äôve noticed that contributes to the first-orderness is the vast majority of people I meet that are in that age tranche a couple decades under me, yet graduated from ‚Äúdirty dozen‚Äù schools is their utter lack of a ‚Äúfund of knowledge‚Äù of the world around them or of history.  They are truly the ‚ÄúIs Google Making Us Stupid‚Äù generationhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/. You also can‚Äôt discount the more forward thinking among the elite realizing the gig is on its way to tits up status and are simply trying to grab all they can before retreating into a spider hole.

            The flocking to which you refer is called emergent behavior by biologists and evolutionary scientists. Think of a flock of starlings or a school of fish moving as a group. No individual member of the group knows why it is moving in a particular direction at a particular time‚Äìit just takes it cues instinctively from the movement of the other members.While such emergent behavior in animals does not necessarily improve the odds of survival of any individual member of the group, it does increase the odds of survival of the group. A particularly speedy fish might stand a better chance of escape from a predator acting on its own, but it instinctively subordinates its survival interest to the collective survival interest of the group.Our social and political elite exhibit a similar form of emergent behavior. The Zman has referred to them as being members of a hive in the sense that nearly all of them grew up in the same zip codes, went to the same group of prep schools and universities, then followed into the same pool of employment opportunities for the elites. They think the same way, because of course they do‚Äìthey are all essentially drones.

                PS.  Even in the early 80s when I graduated from one of the ‚Äúdirty dozen‚Äù you could see that behavior emerging among my classmates.

        I‚Äôm still of the mind that nothing has really changed with Biden‚Äôs woeful performance at the debate.  After all, Trump is still going to get sentenced to jail next week.  The GOP is still feverishly working behind the scenes to remove him from the ballot and/or throw the upcoming election.  Finally, all the Dem ‚Äúfortification‚Äù is still in place in the key states to make sure Biden will win the Electoral College no matter what.  This talk about removing him from the ballot is probably just due to MSM talking heads needing something to yak about this week while waiting for Trump‚Äôs imprisonment.  This debate will be completely forgotten as of next Thursday.I‚Äôve always thought too that there‚Äôs a bit of a perverse incentive for TPTB to keep Biden on the ballot and ‚Äúfortify‚Äù him to victory in November.  What better way to even more thoroughly dispirit the Dirt People than manufacture 100 million phony votes in the middle of the night and double dog dare anyone to claim something fishy took place.  As Theodore Dalrymple said about Commie propaganda, the purpose would be to humiliate people and force them to repeat lies in an effort to control them.

        It is both Volcano People and Russian (heh) roulette players involved here. Biden was put on exhibit to decide whether he continues, but if he proved lacking there was no consideration given as to what comes next. The one round in the pistol went off, so we have been treated to three scenarios thus far: he must go, he must stay and Gnome underwear, because of course.There is an upside here. People have been forced to realize the oligarchy is in full  control, the masses are powerless, and the elected puppets are mere window dressing. The clown show must go on, though, and the rabble who have no input into ‚Äúpopular government‚Äù will put up with it until the day comes when their money is worthless, their stomachs are empty and their houses are cold in the winter. The nursing home beauty pageant just made it easier to predict the reaction to that inevitable day of poverty.It is a rather enjoyable spectacle. Now onto the next act of deciding whether Trump goes to the dungeon or is allowed to serve as puppet. No decision has been made there, either.

            These are the samesoothsayersdriving the Ukraine conflict. Once it becomes obvious their previous narrative is falling apart, they have to come up with another one, also leading to a somewhat happy result (in their minds). Unfortunately for them, Putin isn‚Äôt part of the flock and won‚Äôt play along. It‚Äôs why they had to stage a peace conference‚Äîwithout Putin. It‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt abide Trump. Just one dissenting opinion-leader can destroy their whole Potemkin construct. Now we have one faction in conflict with another about how to rig an election. What will be the result? Russian roulette is a fair analogy.

            Yes, it is not either set-up or screw-up, it‚Äôs both. Trump‚Äôs role has also been overlooked, for once, except to note his luck. Only reason this ‚Äúdebate‚Äù happened was the internal logic of donor-fleecing‚Äì it was objectively unnecessary.

        Biden dropping out has always depended on his being willing to do it.  People forget, even for a politician, he has always had an incredibly distorted view of himself and his own abilities.  There is no reason for that to change now.  This story came out today that the Biden family is circling the wagons and talking about firing campaign advisors, which is absurd, but since they are political advisors they deserve it.  Who do they think they can find that will prevent Biden from experiencing Sundown Syndrome like many other dementia patients?  Another problem is the list of potential replacements is so bad.  They really have no one who can step in and command control of this coalition of lunatics.https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/biden-family-camp-david-debate/index.html

        There are multiple factions vying for power in the Democratic Party, or even within the White House perhaps. That‚Äôs scarcely novel since that‚Äôs virtually always the case in any enterprise, public or private, where groups of people are in a never-ending struggle to decide who controls the resources.Dissidents often remark that it is almost certainly not Biden in charge; rather it‚Äôs his handlers. Among the usual suspects (the Deep State) a force to be reckoned with is DOCTOR Jill. She‚Äôs a latter-day Edith Wilson. Perhaps. More likely than not she is the real power broker on the Biden team. Even a casual knowledge of the Biden history (e.g. Wikipedia bio) reveals the good Dr. and Mr. have been DC fixtures for well over half a century. That‚Äôs a very long time to be immersed in Washington politics and the lazy dissident should jump (nay, saunter) to the conclusion that the Bidens, or at least Jill, must have forged various connections and has established some power structure. For added dramatic effect insert the standard ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got dirt on everyone‚Äù which is almost certainly the case, since you could not even rise to being in charge of the snack bar at the White house without embroiling yourself ethically to some degree.So anyway, back to that faction thing. Surely there are, at a minimum, the Obama-Biden clan vs. the Clintons. There are many more, but aren‚Äôt those the two active ones? There are of course many more powers (e.g. DoD, CIA, State) each of which will have its own shifting loyalty, as the centers of power shift.The events of the past week certainly give credible material for the Hollow Volcano theory to have some credibility: For ages it‚Äôs been rumored that Bidden is hopped up on various drugs for his public appearances. That‚Äôs certainly a reasonable suspicion. And I‚Äôve seen reportage that he‚Äôs been reasonably functional at times, although his gaffes have been evident too. I‚Äôll stoke the fires of conspiracy by pointing out the less obvious: His handlers have the power to tinker with his medications. What‚Äôs to say that a decision was made to deliberately medicate him Thursday so that his aberrant behavior at the debate would be all but guaranteed?¬†The mainstream media storm since then seems to be, on the whole, the Outer Party calling for him to resign. Again, the conspriacist will suspect that is all orchestrated propaganda from the Inner Party. That‚Äôs a reasonable assumption, but one is left to ponder which faction currently controls the Ministry of Truth. The two-faction hypothesis would say the Clinton Gang.It‚Äôs worth reiterating that it‚Äôs not easy to remove a President against his will. I‚Äôm no expert of course, but it‚Äôs my understanding that unless he voluntarily resigns, it‚Äôs very unlikely that the 25th Amendment could be successfully used. Especially getting 2/3 of both houses of Congress voting to oust him. Never happen.¬†And of course that would require Harris to be sworn in, although I don‚Äôt see why she‚Äôd be any harder to control than Biden was. Based on the putative iron will of Dr. Jill alone I find it bloody improbable that she would permit her meal ticket to resign, at least not without a fight.While it sure seems that government on the whole doesn‚Äôt think very far ahead, one makes a crucial error thinking that there aren‚Äôt still some clever people in places of power. This isn‚Äôt to say that all events that transpire are the machinations of the evil genius minds in the hollowed out volcano. I‚Äôm merely saying that there are some very smart people in the game always working for their own (or their own affiliated group) ends.We definitely live in ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù times. Of course America has had its share of political scandals, but I‚Äôve never seen anything like the present, and I‚Äôm well past 60.

            It would actually be pretty easy to get Jill to pull him from the race.  Garland or some other messenger from the DOJ can threaten a full investigation into the whole Biden cabal unless Joe suddenly decides he wants to spend more time with his family and bows out.

        I guarantee you there are millions of Americans who are convinced Biden is a great president and was just off his game last week.  There‚Äôs that saying that if you‚Äôre not liberal when you‚Äôre young, you have no heart.  If you‚Äôre not conservative when you‚Äôre old, you have no brain.  There are vast numbers of old goats who fall into the brainless category.  That just about everyone can‚Äôt see at this point that voting, particularly at the federal level is nothing but a massive circle jerk, is ridiculous.  The propagandizing over the last 60 odd years has been both effective and disastrous.

            I saw people on Reddit claiming that it was just some stuttering. You know, that debilitating stutter that Biden has been dealing with his entire life. The one that nobody ever heard between 1970 and 2015. The one that manifests in him mumbling incoherently and forgetting who he is talking to, unlike everyone else who has a stutter. They even trotted out Obama to claim it was just a bad debate performance, like he had in 2012. Exactly the same thing! It really shows two things, one is how little the ruling class thinks of average people, and two, how they are, in many instances, correct.

        Also, I would dispute the idea that ‚Äúthey‚Äù wanted to be rid of Biden, so they rolled him out there. I think, as noted, that stupid is as stupid does, and when you combine stupidity with hubris‚Ä¶ And really, in this one case I find it kinda hard to blame them. That ‚Äúdebate‚Äù was justcomicallyrigged. Biden had the questions in advance. He quite clearly had an earpiece (and supposedly ‚Äúwon‚Äù some kind of secret coin toss which allowed him to pick ‚Äúonly being filmed from the right,‚Äù which is such a bizarre stipulation that it only makes sense if they‚Äôre trying to conceal an earpiece‚Ä¶ which he then flopped and spazzed around so much that they couldn‚Äôt hide anyway). Trump‚Äôs mic was shut off. The two most partisan Democrats this side of Hunter and Dr. Jill her own self were chosen as ‚Äúmoderators.‚Äù Frankly I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt have Trump show up in a literal clown car, with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big doodie head‚Äù written on his forehead in magic marker. That was the safest bet this side of picking the Globetrotters over the Generals‚Ä¶ but despite what Krusty the Klown showed us, sometimes the Generalsaredue.

        I will go out on a limb and predict that Biden will be get the nomination, unless he dies in his sleep like Scalia did. There is no easily navigable path to replace him at this point in time. Also, it is too late to remove him from the ballot in Wisconsin, Nevada, and Georgia unless he is dead or incapacitated.Zelensky just announced that he has a framework for a negotiated solution with Russia. This is perhaps the best signal thus far that the Democrats know they are going to lose in 2024. The focus of the elites will now shift from winning in 2024 to putting the mechanisms in place to contain Trump in his second term.

                Others have pointed out that these are not state laws or regulations, but party rules ‚Äì and party rules can be changed any time. We saw in 2016 how the party can basically do whatever it wants when it shivved Bernie. The issue, though, is that the most important parts of the DNC are run by Biden loyalists, as usually happens when someone rises to the top. They‚Äôre not going to voluntarily allow for rule changes that lead to them getting pushed out of power. Also, let‚Äôs say Biden steps aside, who replaces him? Gavin Newsom? Oh, that tall and handsome green-eyed White man with a White wife and beautiful White kids? That guy is going to step over a stunning and brave ‚Äúblack‚Äù woman in the Spiteful Mutant party? Oh, so maybe it should be that stunnning and brave ‚Äúblack‚Äù woman, the one who nobody likes, won 2% in 2020, talks like a moron, and was clearly picked as assassination insurance.There‚Äôs a reason why Biden was picked in 2020, and most of those same reasons still hold today.

            It‚Äôs hard to believe thatZelensky would negotiate a settlement that didn‚Äôt involve him staying in power in Keeeeeve. It‚Äôs also hard to believe the Russians would even start such a negotiation since they must know that anything short of a pro-Russia regime in Keeeeeeve just means the Ukies will re-arm and try again in a year.
I suppose it‚Äôs possible that the ‚Äúnegotiation‚Äù simply involved Russia telling Zelensky that they would let him live as long as he stepped down along with the rest of his government, though.

            It‚Äôs a matter of virtue signal maximization. There are only so many boutique beliefs you can adopt to signal your contempt for the peasants and your aspiration to a room in the palace. Since none of these signals cost much to use, you just pick them all. The same train fanciers all drive Teslas too and pay extra for carbon offsets when they fly. Those with a bit of money don‚Äôt pick either-or, when they can afford both-and.

        The dark side of the incompetence revealed in today‚Äôs post is a latent evil that also resides within the deep recesses of the political class. Yes, they foster chaos as a goal in itself, but they intended to use that turmoil as a trigger for societal anger and internecine violence. Set the plebs against each other and enable the Jackboot imposition of tyranny. All the great tyrants of the 20th Century used this technique to kill millions and acquire total power. And never forget that all Jackboots think they wear the white hat while mercilessly slaughtering innocents (see Gaza as an example). What beats this? Well, in Gaza, popping out of a hole in the ground with a homemade RPG seems to be working quite well. Live and learn.

        O‚ÄôReilly and Fox News were among my favorites 20 or so years ago as I was gradually working my way over to and across the great divide.  I soured on him a few years later, probably sometime after obomba was first elected.  The left probably began to label him as far right or some such and he started blabbing constantly that he was a ‚Äúfair and balanced‚Äù independent ‚Äì not conservative.  It wasn‚Äôt long after that I dropped both.  Couldn‚Äôt care less what he has to say about anything ‚Äì his time has long ago come and gone.

        I have a bit of a different take on this. It has long been thought or believed by many that the POTUS is mostly a figurehead without much official power, so what is really the big deal if he is old and in declining competence?In a monarchy, senile kings in their dotage do not present a problemunlessthere is already some kind of succession issue or factional war or great external crisis brewing. In a time of peace, the king would simply sit harmlessly on the throne while his ministers took care of affairs, because he and his family are the hereditary heads of state. Of course, for reasons of decorum, the ministers would continue to cheer the king‚Äôs good health in public and confess his undying love for his crown and his people. Everybody with a brain knows what is really going on, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. This is just something you do for old people, and it usually doesn‚Äôt do any harm. Senile kings do not cause panic in an otherwise functioning state.I think most people, both inside and outside the government, just assumed that this was also the case with ‚ÄúJoe Biden,‚Äù up until the debate last Thursday night. The sudden media freak-out is very unusual and really requires a different explanation.I think the media are looking to make Biden the fall guy for the last 5 years of their own awful behavior. They have lied about Covid, lied about Ukraine, lied about the economy and climate change and the green energy transition, and lied about immigration, demographics, and national solvency. They need some way to absolve themselves, so they are dropping all the dirty iron on Joe Biden‚Äôs corpse. The ferocious swarm of media jackals saw an opportunity wriggle away from a mountain of failed policies and emerge more or less intact, so they jumped at the chance.As usual, the regime sort of overestimates the extent to which the average American is even paying attention. Their carefully crafted lies and strategies assume that the typical viewer has a beltway maven‚Äôs level of interest in all the issuesdu jour,which gives their prevarications a hollow and wonky effect. They always end up protesting too much.

        The same 1 dimensional thinking is seen in how all these conflicts are handled.  Every time we say we‚Äôre going to send the Ukes a new obsolete tank, missile, or fighter, the usual people think the war will be quickly won.  Anyone who spent time in a combat unit knows they‚Äôll make no difference and there is no winning that war.Same in the Middle East.  Netanyahu is talking about adventures in Lebanon and Syria ‚Äì which would probably pull the U.S. into the war and could still result in the destruction of Israel.  But there is no thinking of next steps or consequences ‚Äì just do the next dumb thing that comes to mind and assume it will succeed.

        Biden‚Äôs staff lied to themselves as they lied to the rest of us, and they began to accept their lies, if half-heartedly, so they didn‚Äôt judge his condition to be as serious as it was shown to be. I think they felt forced to let Biden debate, so they agreed but set the terms: it was early, the opponent‚Äôs mic was muted while his opponents answer was given and so on. They had to gamble that Biden would have a good day, or that they could help him have one, and that failed. It was a gamble they thought they had to take, and they lost. I don‚Äôt think it was part of a canny strategy to trip him up and replace him‚Äì it‚Äôs too difficult to replace him this late in the game. Conclusion: stupidity not subtle genius.

        The ruling class never thought the debate or Biden himself would be a problem. They‚Äôve succeeded with this zombie for the last three and a half years; why not now? Then he did everything but die onstage last week and there‚Äôs no plan B. No one set up the debate to trip him. If that was the plan they would not have demanded special conditions tailored to accommodate Biden favorably. They went early thinking they could score a media victory amidst all the bad news seeping in around the edges from places like Ukraine and poor polling and the fact that legalized persecution of the bad orange man hasn‚Äôt destroyed his popularity. The ruling class truly cannot see more than one step ahead. This is especially alarming when such myopia might lead them to believe they can finally beat them damn Russians, if we use maybe just one or two little tactical nukes. Little ones, you know. Just a few kilotons.

            This seems most likely. It leaves us with only one oddity. Debate Biden was no different from usual. He‚Äôs been this same retarded corpse for years and it‚Äôs never been hidden. Democrats (and ‚Äúour‚Äù guys who are in fact mere Democrats) just couldn‚Äôt see it, not least because they weren‚Äôt allowed to say it. So what was it,other than Biden, who had been made invisible to them, that triggered them finally to see and say? I‚Äôve seen one theory: In seeking to hinder Trump, they made the debate rules and staging so constrained and fake that Biden not tonally adapting to them‚Äîinstead ‚Äúbeing himself,‚Äù as is supposedly his virtue‚Äîmade him seem completely insane. But he always has.Regardless, the Democrats are recovering (and ‚Äúour‚Äù Democrats will follow). The pre-debate story, that Biden is the sharpest political thinker in America (the transcript is a literary masterpiece!) and ackshually it‚Äôs Trump who‚Äôs demented, is back on‚Äîjust like after all the January 6th ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù narratives proved false, they all still happened.EvenCruz and Desantis agree that Trump supporters are terrorists,evenRand Paul voted to give the capitol cops commendations for bravery, etc.

        The simplest reason 4D chess theories will always find a buyer is that nobody sounds clever for saying ‚ÄúThose people are dumb, and they made a mistake.‚Äù It might betrue, but if I say ‚Äúhey, those dumb people sure are dumb, and dumb people do dumb things,‚Äù the only reaction I‚Äôm likely to get is ‚ÄúNo shit, Sherlock.‚Äù But if I come up with some 4D chess explanation, some people think I‚Äôm a super-clever sleuth.

It‚Äôs even harder to beat for social media likes and upvotes and retweets, and there you have it. Just as you never make a name for yourself in the History Biz by saying ‚ÄúYeah, the conventional wisdom is right,‚Äù you never get yourself a rep as an online guru by restating the obvious‚Ä¶ even when the obvious is really, really obvious, i.e. ‚Äúthese are stupid people, and stupid is as stupid does.‚Äù Yeah thanks Forrest Gump.

        Biden‚Äôs condition was well known years ago. If the power brokers wanted him out they would have arranged that a year ago. Power brokers being basically Obama, who runs (in a lazy fashion) the Democratic Party.Biden being senile is a feature, not a bug, of his Presidency. It lets Obama control the White House from afar, without too much trouble. It prevents ambitious younger rivals from emerging in the Party to challenge Obama. Ever notice how ‚Äúthin‚Äù the Democratic bench is? A gay dude with a weirdo name suggesting perversion, who can accomplish nothing but posing with his ‚Äúhusband‚Äù and Gaybie and prosthetic breast to ‚Äúbreast feed‚Äù the infant, A gaggle of aging post menopausal Girl Boss witches. A Patrick Bateman styled sociopath with zero appeal even inside his state. The incompetent ex Ho of Willie Brown. That‚Äôs it. And that is by design. So Obama can rule the Party for his lifetime.Trump is guaranteed now I think to go to jail for a very very long time. It will be appealed but not before he is sent without his protection detail to general stir and problem solved for Obama very quickly. Probably nothing will happen, but who knows.The Draft, and a draft for older Whites to serve in defense production which is coming, that could very well kick off extra spicy stuff. Particularly since enemies like China and Russia get a say. My own sense is that Soros/CIA are thoroughly compromised by China and basically an agent of Xi Xinping at this point.So the best bet is more and more chaos. Which works right up until Napoleon, Caesar, Putin, Erdogan, Xi, and Stalin come in as there is a limit for even the most rich and powerful society to tolerate chaos.

                I‚Äôve always thought they telegraphed their intentions for succession: Hillary -&gt; Obama -&gt; then Weiner/Abedin as syncretic Jewish-Islamic post-American royal family, because the purpose of Our Democracy (no voting!) is to End Whiteness. Arc of history, etc.But Obama is narcissistic and dumb so he cut in line, Hillary got jumped by Trump, and Weiner misplayed his second ‚Äúsex scandal.‚Äù (His first, where he was showing his erection to underage girls, hadgreatlyincreased his approval among women and guaranteed him the mayoralty of NYC. In his second he got busted begging for love from a trashy e-thot with a lot of cellulite, and the female vote dried up so fast it was audible.)As several today have noted, the regime doesn‚Äôt do contingencies. The current incoherent state of things is nobody‚Äôs plan‚Äîmade of many plots.

        Quite a thought-provoking essay today.‚ÄúPutting that aside, this inability to think more than one step ahead is augmented by the fact that these people are unable to think about anything other than their own desires and how to achieve them.‚ÄùTo take the chess metaphor a bit further, one of the necessary steps in moving from a beginner to an intermediate player is learning to fathom the other player‚Äôs motives and options and incorporating them into one‚Äôs own thinking. One tries to implement one‚Äôs own ideas in the framework of what the opponent‚Äôs resources, threats and ideas are. It leads to a richer and more objective appraisal.‚ÄúThis lack of second order thinking has another strange result. The system now seems to select for people who prefer chaos over order. If you cannot plan more than one move ahead, then a world where planning ahead has no reward, a world of random chaos, reduces the benefit of that ability. In other words, the mediocrities are creating an environment in which having a mediocre mind is an asset. Their impulsive behavior creates conditions that reward first order thinking.‚ÄùThis is true to the extent that if you want to become part of the gang, you have to be just as stupid as them, or adopt a very convincing persona of stupidity. The old saying comes to mind ‚Äî ‚Äúif you want to get along, you have to go along.‚Äù But other than this, mediocrity is a liability. The ability to plan and act on that basis is an asset. Those of us who are thinking about the end of empire ‚Äî and acting on these thoughts ‚Äî are in an immeasurably superior position to those dolts who think that the status quo will continue indefinitely. And you make the same point in your concluding sentence:‚ÄúChance has a sense of humor, but it always favors those with a prepared mind.‚Äù

        I‚Äôve been a skeptic about the ‚Äúremove Biden‚Äù theory mainly on the grounds that it requires cooperation by the Biden‚Äôs.   As we rolled into today, we saw them blaming their ‚Äúdebate prep team‚Äù for his insane performance.  They are not dropping out by Tuesday, it would seem.And today, SCOTUS put a fork in Jack Smith.  Justice Thomas even wrote in the dissent that a private citizen cannot prosecute anybody, much less a former President.  This is a peek at the lawsuits about the Constitutionality of Jack Smith‚Äôs entire existence as a ‚Äúspecial prosecutor‚Äù.None of these retards saw this coming because the point of the Jack Smith ‚Äúindictments‚Äù was to create bad press so Trump would drop out.  Everything since then is the regime staggering along not quite sure what to do next, but certain their dreams would be realized.Ir is so bad that Judge Cannon in Miami got the Jack Smith team to admit to intentional, premeditated EVIDENCE TAMPERING.The status quo is that the stupidity will continue right up to the election, and then we‚Äôll see spasms of violence.Just like we‚Äôre seeing in France.  Nobody questioned Macron‚Äôs ‚Äúsnap election‚Äù.  His party got destroyed.

        Oh boy, Bill O‚ÄôReilly, I haven‚Äôt listened to him for shits ‚Äòn giggles for months now. I did try recently to hear him cry about Assange‚Äôs deal  but it looks like he never addressed it, just had his morning man mention it briefly. O‚ÄôReilly also was always banging on how the ‚Äúruble will be rubble‚Äù and other such predictions about the war in Ukraine till he got tired of being wrong. It‚Äôs a marvel how the media, mainstream and otherwise loves to go full fantasyland with all their predictions how things are going to end up, the wars, the candidates, the election. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs got it locked up now‚Äù, ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs a goner‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs beyond the margin for fraud‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôll be blood in the streets!‚Äù‚ÄùFauci‚Äôs going to jail!‚Äù‚ÄùWe‚Äôre going to Mars‚Äù‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs all too soon to tell.

            I can‚Äôt downvote that because I hope it‚Äôs so but, look at Meloni and Italy. Meloni was probably more dissident sounding than LePen ever was, yet it took her less than a week to change her tune and join GloboHomo whole-heartedly. She has been a reliable voice for the EU and NATO since then. You can‚Äôt listen to them when they are running but rather judge them by their actions when they get in office.

                French people revere their state the way many American rightists worship GAE. Both groups don‚Äôt seem to understand that their idol is the source of many or their problems. The National Rally wants to improve how the French state operates rather than remove the bureaucrats and crony capitalist parasites who constitute the sinews of ‚Äútheir‚Äù elite. They think it just needs a little tinkering and then ‚Äúback on track‚Äù.
They are ,for now, far too optimistic. They will learn

The response Bongino had for O‚ÄôReilly after he (O‚ÄôReilly) demonstrated his own one dimensional thinking and showed a brief clip of Bongino and then referring to ‚Äòfanatics‚Äô was almost worth the price of admission, considering the tantrum GoneBeeno displayed afterwards.

        This almost precisely the problem, not only with D.C. but with nearly everyone of our institutions.  Higher Ed, Government Run Schools, Municiapalities, Corporate America, etc., etc., ad nauseum.For the past three generations or so, we have been rewarding and advancing folks based on almost any metric OTHER THAN MERIT!!!  After one generation, everything is still mostly fine (to quote Adam Smith, ‚Äúthere is a great deal of ruin in a nation) since that first generation was not entirely corrupt and idiotic.You begin to see the deterioriation in that second generation of fools and imbecile who are being promoted to various leadership positions in the private and public sectors.  But all is not lost, YET!We are now witnessing the results of that third wave of morons running, really ruining, everything.  Here are just a few examples.  Bud Light.  Disney.  The Rear Admiral, Mayor Pete, and all the rest of Ole Joe‚Äôs Cabinet.  I mean, seriously, FFS, I wouldn‚Äôt let Jennifer Granholm house sit for me for a weekend.  She would burn the place down I would expect.This how we get Joe Biden in the Whitehouse.  And Willie Brown‚Äôs old girlfriend is VP.And I don‚Äôt see a way out in our current form as a nation.  Only violent break up or total tyrannical rule.

        Both theories are true, of course; simultaneously at different levels the system of governance.This is what happens in big bureaucracies. I worked in the National Health Service, the biggest bureaucracy in Europe, and it is normal for the most senior policy levels to have different agendas from mid levels, and also for senior people to setup lower levels to fail (including relying on guaranteed incompetence of known idiots).Then there is inter-factional infighting at the highest levels, with perhaps as many agendas as people.I would also suggest that the main source of apparent incompetence is that the whole system is pervaded by routine and gross dishonesty; so that nobody at all knows what is going on, what works or what is likely to happen ‚Äì although many delusionally assume they do.
