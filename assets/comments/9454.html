        Heh, ‚Äúconservatives.‚Äù  What have they ever conserved?  On a related note, if the Alt-Right, Alt-White, Alt-Whatever ever want to be taken seriously by the kind of folks who can build an effective mass movement, they need to stop pretending to be intellectuals.  Actually that‚Äôs good advice for ‚Äúconservatives,‚Äù too ‚Äî there is Reality, and there is Theory, and when the two conflict, Theory must yield.  Otherwise, all you‚Äôre doing is rationalizing for a paycheck.  There is exactly one political principle that doesn‚Äôt lead directly to totalitarianism: Equality before the law.  Abandon that, and pretty soon all you‚Äôre doing is debating terminology ‚Äî is it a concentration camp, a labor camp, or thought reform?

That is a brilliant formulation, and even usable in leftie company, albeit with care. I‚Äôm going to rip it off shamelessly in the future.

            I was discussing this with friends the other day and added that we were returning to some insane neo ‚Äì ottoman millet system where the gays dress one way and have this set of obligations, privileges, and laws; the blacks another; the whites yet another; go on down the list. Our forefathers fought and bled to stop this.  Now we‚Äôre marching back to the Middle Ages at the double time.   This has got to stop.

Problem is, that‚Äôs more than likely going to require hurting people and breaking stuff, as opposed to mere argument.  Most people really, really shy away from that.  The Left far less so than the Right, which probably goes a long way towards why they tend to win out more often.

        The primary vice of cuckservatism is virtue signaling. It‚Äôs why Trump is Satan to them, because he undermines all of that. It isn‚Äôt about conserving anything or making the country great again, it‚Äôs about being morally superior to liberals and the dirt people. Even worse is that they have internalized to a large degree the Cathedral definitions of virtue, anti-racism for example.

            Right. The first problem is in accepting the premisses of the opposition.  On another comment board the other day I brought up the dialog between Buckley and Gore Vidal that was used in the Goldberg book Libs‚Äôr the Real Fascists. If instead of acting the way he did and getting upset about being called a crypto-fascist, Buckley had instead shrugged and replied that sharing a stage with a guy like Charles Lindbergh would be more pleasant than having to talk to a fat faggot like Vidal,  this business of shaming people like that would have began dying right then and there. Instead, Buckley reacted in a way that made him look defiant, but at the same time he was accepting the premise that shaming people as such is ok, but not when you do it to me.Goldberg quotes the episode with glee. He doesn‚Äôt understand that Buckley allowed a collar and leash to be put on his movement that day, and that they have been wearing it ever since.Time to take off that collar. Maybe the place to start is by mauling the ones holding the leash.

                Exactly. Another thing about Goldberg‚Äôs book that I found hilarious was he spent a lot of time on the fact the Left does not know its own history. The exact same thing could be said of the Buckley Right. Those regular purges were mostly about memory holing their own past.

                    That is kind of my question. Was this always self-serving, or was there originally some tactical reasoning behind it?

                        The tactical reasoning, I think, was that ‚Äúwe‚Äù conservatives could behave like civilized people, and by not stooping to their level, would retain the moral high ground.  Back then, they didn‚Äôt realize how Leninist the Left, even the apparently nice and reasonable Left, really was.  To the Leninist, anything, anything at all ‚Äî even going deep cover as a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù for years ‚Äî is acceptable if it furthers the Revolution.  The Official Right, and most Americans who would call themselves ‚Äúconservatives,‚Äùstilldon‚Äôt realize that ALL Leftists are Terminators ‚Äî they can‚Äôt be bargained with, they can‚Äôt be reasoned with, and they will not stop, ever, until you are assimilated.

                        Looks tactical. It is collective insanity. Vladimir Lenin was spot on brilliant about useful dupes. Look at the vulva hat cat lady protest. Collective insanity loves company, they had a great time, embraced in the warmth of hundreds of thousands of fellow derangement. The human extinction movement has no lack of disciples.

                    Goldberg remains such a puzzling case.  His book Liberal Fascism showed remarkable scholarship, however it seems a solution in search of a problem.  The peripatetic John Rivers on Twitter pointed out this.  Granted, Dems R Real Racist.  So, can we then discuss progressives racist attitudes against white people?  At this juncture, Conservatism Inc. goes silent as the tomb.His Never Trump stance also remains incoherent.  Dennis Prager had him on his show, and pressed him.  When asked if his vote could make the difference between Trump or Hillary becoming president, he averred he would vote Trump.  Yet he still clung to his position that he could not vote for him.  Talk about cognitive dissonance!

                        A dozen years ago or so, I showed up at one of their fundraisers. You could mingle with the writers and ask questions. I was talking with Goldberg and mentioned something about VDare. It was in passing. Goldberg froze. It was like he saw a ghost. He then said, ‚Äúyou should not read that site or have anything to do with it.‚Äù He then turned and sprinted away from me.It was at that point I realized that the political class had broke free from its moorings. Even those allegedly on the right were so afraid of being called a racist that there was nothing they would not sign off on to avoid suspicion. The Left had won and the New Religion would be imposed on all of us.There‚Äôs also another thing with Goldberg that is true for a lot of NeverTrump people. They were expecting jobs from the next GOP administration. Jonah‚Äôs old lady was looking to land as an under secretary somewhere. If you do the math, Trump was a million dollar catastrophe for the Goldberg family. Bill Kristol had spent a lot of time and money figuring out how he would decorate his new office in the West Wing once Bush/Rubio was elected.It is not just the money. Prestige is the currency of Washington. Having a WH gig on the CV is a big deal. It gets you on boards and the speaking circuit. Most important, it gets you invited to the big events and treated like you‚Äôre special. That means everything to these people. Washington is like high school. Trump cancelled the prom and everyone is pissed.

                            I still recall way back in the second term of Bush 43, reading National Review.  Therein Goldberg, with visible relief, declared ‚Äúwe lost‚Äù the battle on gay marriage, so let‚Äôs just get over it.  Surrendering marriage, one of the most obviously central values of not only the West but nearly all cultures in human history, proved a relief to Goldberg.  Long before SCOTUS put the imprimatur of ‚Äúlaw‚Äù upon this farce.
I‚Äôm utterly convinced had Hillary won, Conservatism Inc. would quickly surrender on everything from the 1st Amendment through the 10th, all in the name of Responsible Republicanism.

                            Love it that the Prom was cancelled.  I am swinging like a wild pendulum yes/no about attending my Vassar 50th Reunion in June.  Several jerky classmates oohed and ahhed at Ms. Streep‚Äôs, Vassar ‚Äô71, ‚Äúclassy‚Äù Golden Globes remarks and want her to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù at our event.  Another group chartered a bus from Rochester NY to attend the Pussycat Parade (Voluble Vulvas!) last Saturday.  I know they will be at Reunion, probably sharing photos of this remarkable occasion, seeing as most of them lack grandchildren to boast about, or even longstanding husbands.  The alums I might choose to visit our class would be Betsy McCoy (sp is wrong, but that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs pronounced) or even Anthony Bourdain, who pretty much told liberals how out of touch they were with the rest of the country.  I‚Äôll keep you posted on my doings.  Cheers, All.

                This certainly dates back to the early days of Buckley, but what was the point of it all? That being virtuous would persuade people to the conservative side? I don‚Äôt think it ever really worked, and quickly devolved into a circle jerk which then devolved into a self destruct button that the left could press at its leisure. With the nevertrump crap, what was once a self-defeating circlejerk are now the hard left‚Äôs useful idiots.

                    Since I am one of the victims of the mind fuck that took place back then, I can only view it in retrospect and speculate about how things could have gone differently. I think that a lot of the problem was in the western mindset that came into being after wwii. The country had been in the thrall of the left ever since the great depression, and was just beginning to wake up to the failures of left wing rule when the war bailed out FDR‚Äôs government and then you had the gorrillions killed in the holocaust, solidifying a sort of liberal consensus. You had all of the major intellectuals of the day deriding the paranoid style of right wing politics, and McCarthy getting crucified. It‚Äôs easy to see how people with any ambition of public legitimacy were going to be intimidated. When you swim in such an ocean it gets hard to notice the water. I think Buckley thought he was doing the right thing. He looked smart, but was really just thrashing around trying to swim upstream like the rest of us.This is why at this point I  try not to criticize people any more than I feel I have to. There is a whole specrum of right wing opinion and we can‚Äôt afford to be fighting each other too much. One thing I like about Z is that when he takes someone on it is usually someone who is causing trouble in the ranks more than attacking the other side. I try to do the same.

                        Were the Founders alive today they would with one possible exception be regarded as altright (not to mention pushing 300 years old). They held very significant differences among one another resulting in personal animosities years later. This is as it should be. It is the left that is bereft of  diversity. The broad altright contains within itself the maxim that often times the opposite of a profound truth is another profound truth. The left is not so much the opposite of truth as it is the absence of it, an absence which is vigorously enforced. Man, given a choice between certainty and uncertainty, is prone to choosing certainty.

                Ronald Reagan, whose bust is on the library shelf of every respectable cuckservative, set the tone. We can be grateful that he recognized ‚Äî unlike so many public intellectuals of both left and right ‚Äî that the Soviet Union was teetering on the brink of oblivion and would soon self-destruct. He had the good sense to help its demise by avoiding anything foolish in opposing it. But otherwise, Reagan was at best a rhetorical conservative with the ability to deliver a good line.What did he actually do, or at least try to do, that was genuinely conservative? Despite word bombs (‚Äúwelfare queens,‚Äù etc.) he made no serious effort to end the system of paying the underclass not to riot. Deficit spending continued. He presided over an amnesty for border jumpers. The sound track of the Reagan years was the music of pseudo-conservatism taking over.

            Vox Popoli posted this a few days ago:‚ÄúGlenn Reynolds has some sage advice for the Right facing an increasingly deranged Left and squadrons of SJWs resolutely doubling down:Progressives Destroyed Normalcy And Now They‚Äôre Shocked Trump Isn‚Äôt Normal. Choose the form of your Destructor. But I disagree with the thesis of this piece that people on the right should embrace civility and normalcy. Civility and normalcy are privileges that require a broad consensus. Conservatives have been utter failures at ‚Äúconserving‚Äù these traits.Here‚Äôs my take:There‚Äôs an old joke about a boy who complains to his mother that his little sister keeps pulling his hair.‚ÄúOh,‚Äù responds the mother, ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt know that it hurts.‚ÄùA few minutes later, the mother hears the girl scream and runs into the other room. ‚ÄúShe knows now,‚Äù the boy explains.There‚Äôs a lesson for Republicans in that old joke, if they‚Äôre smart enough to absorb it.I think that Trump is smart enough.

                Conservatives have always defined success in relation to the Left. They would win if the Left adopted their ideas.
Trump and an increasing number of people are defining victory as achieving specific agenda items like trade and immigration. if the Left or Right is upset, too bad. They need to deal with that on their own. It‚Äôs why both sides of official Washington are in a panic. Their main weapon has been rendered useless and they can‚Äôt think and a plan B. To his credit, Trump seems to get this and he is pressing his advantage from the start.

                    It is astonishing to watch how quickly and successfully Trump is wading through the DC swamp, swinging that machete.  In politics, as in sports, if you can press your advantage in a way that keeps the opposition from keeping up, the battle is half won before it begins.It is interesting to see that many of Trump‚Äôs initiatives are not really part of the right-left calculation, but instead moves of simple common sense.  Legal immigration, not illegal.  Push back against Sanctuary Cities‚Äìthat is, push back against institutional conscious lawlessness.  Lobby business to bring jobs home.  Was there large scale voter fraud?  Maybe.  Let‚Äôs investigate and find out.  Trump has outfoxed both sides, because they have fallen so far down the political rabbit-hole, simple common sense becomes a series of revolutionary (and welcome) acts.

                        We are seeing a lot of paper tigers go up in flames. The Left evolved to defeat an enemy that was always willing to lose. The Right evolved to negotiate their next surrender to the Left. Trump is plowing through these guys in large part because he dismisses the rules of the game. But, he has also figured out that they are paper tigers. I suspect he is a bit surprised by it.I‚Äôm coming around to the idea that Trump may end up doing a ton of things that everyone said were impossible, mostly because they were long overdue and everyone knows it.

                            The fatal flaw of liberalism, talking in the classical sense not about the progressive left and liberalism in this sense describes modern so-called conservatism, is their belief that reason can solve everything. This leads to disaster because unreasonable people can‚Äôt be reasoned with. Evil can‚Äôt be reasoned with. Reasoning with the left is what got us here, and what is destroying western civilization.

                            To me, a large part of it is, don‚Äôt accept their talking point or strawman ( ie, the science is settled) , question their premises and point out the obvious.

                Yes. They thought they were eliminating an indomitable enemy, they created a legion of warriors. Look where Steve Bannon ended up, look at the Alt-Right, the revolution of the dirt people. I believe Andrew by his example helped to catalyze an entire zeitgeist. He also knew what Podesta and the rest of the vile hedonistic Clinton crime syndicate was involved in. It‚Äôs probably why Andrew is dead.

        Beck seems to have a dependent personality disorder. He was the lone voice of reason during his tenure at Crazed News Network,which propelled him to the nascent Fox. He was brash and funny in the early days. He‚Äôs an admitted addict,who‚Äôs transferred dependence on drugs &amp; alcohol to his public persona, Glenn Beck,Inc,Blazing Truther. He derailed himself that moment he ran Teddy Bears to the illegals pouring into Texas. He fell right into the trap the Obama administration had set-show the sad children,and generous Americans comply with the real agenda-to seed the country with new,improved Democrat voters.

            My read on Beck is he is a guy who lacks moderation. If he was going to drink, he was going to be a roaring drunk. If was going to be religious, then he was going find the most extreme expression he could join. What happens is he gets to that terminal point and still cannot find happiness, so he drops it and rockets off on some new crusade. His proselytizing in the campaign went nowhere so he is busy finding a new cause. Whatever that is, he‚Äôll dive into with the zeal of a fanatic.

                He‚Äôs a revivalist preacher with no core set of values or principles. I‚Äôve listened to him enough to know he makes absolutely no sense.  His next move will be to start the Cult of Glen Beck to see how many zombies he can really attract and brainwash.

        I like reading your blog for the same reason I like listening to Chris Plante while driving to work in the morning. You always make me at least smile, if not laugh out loud. This was a great example. I did get a good laugh at the insults. People do not do that enough anymore. I have always believed that one sign of a healthy work environment is that people can bust on each other regularly and everyone understands that it is in good fun and not meant to injure anyone. Anyway, it is funny that somehow I have gravitated away from Red State. I used to read it every day, but not any more. Anyway, thank you for the smile in an otherwise grim day.

Get inside the enemies OODA Loop.Or Cashus Clay‚Äôs strategy to Joe Frasher, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hit you so many times you‚Äôll think your surrounded‚Äù  Through history of the medium of broadcast ‚Äúnews‚Äù the media is accustomed to the power of controlling the pace and timber of events coming out of the presidential administration. They have enjoyed a certain level of intimidation. Trump has overwhelmed them and gaslights them on a scale they are not equipped nor staffed with to even keep up with. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúGit er done‚Äù, it‚Äôs called doing the job your hired to do, no excuses, no waffling. Keeping your promises. They don‚Äôt know what to do. And with every act, and it is the act in war, as the old Austrian Generals said, that matters. and with every act they get left more and more for dust. It is a beautiful thing to watch. The best ringside seat of history in the making imaginable.

                    PS, TT thats a superb observation you brought up if you don‚Äôt mind my saying so. It is incredibly germane to the subject, if for no other reason than it is redefining politics on a level unimaginable even a week ago.It is so dynamic you have to stop and re-orient your critical thinking process. I think it is safe to contend, if you see Trump as some sort of ideological political deplorable beast that must be got rid of, you represent a clear and present danger to the principles of representative process and will of the governed of republican form of government. You represent a danger to legitimacy of that process.

        Headline: ‚ÄòThe US Is No Longer A ‚ÄúFull Democracy‚Äù According To The Economist‚Äô. Ah, it never was a democracy to begin with. You have to read the ‚Äúreport‚Äù to grasp the scope of collective dichotomy here. But what is fascinating is a cuck or a progressive could have written it, and you would be hard pressed to know which did. But then, ‚Äúwhat difference does it make at this point‚Äù, unquote. What is the best irony here, is it the headline, or is it an economist who calls a Republic a democracy, because if your a true economist the first thing you have to understand is the difference between different forms of government before you can forecast economics, right? Or is it how many are fooled by such brainwashing propaganda.https://qz.com/894362/america-has-been-downgraded-to-a-flawed-democracy-but-not-because-of-trump-economist-intelligence-unit-says/

            Seeing as how ‚ÄúThe Economist‚Äù has been wrong about pretty much everything for the last thirty years, their only remaining function is as a compass pointing South. If the U.S. and the world had done the opposite of what The Economist has advocated over the last few decades, we‚Äôd be far, far ahead.

                Predicting economics is as about as valid as predicting the climate. They used to call it snake oil.Seems like the only true economic forecasting is more theory of human activity regarding freedom and tyranny. Like the philosophical insights from Von Misses.

            The Economist and the FT are the house organs of the European members of the Davos crowd.  It is always interesting to keep up with the thinking of your intellectual enemies.  The FT has been reduced to infusing Trump snark and hate into all of their articles, including the gardening section and restaurant reviews.  Very tiresome stuff, my rather expensive sub will not be renewed.I guess the upside of seeing how things are going over there, is that they must be absolutely petrified of what is coming their way.  Global man lives in mortal fear that their con job on the public has been unmasked.

        Whatever Team Bush proposed, Red State branded as ‚ÄúReaganesque‚Äù and ‚Äúprincipled conservatism‚Äù, especially if it meant killing Muslims.A war of attrition is effective, but it‚Äôs obvious that‚Äôs not what Bush wanted to do, because we didn‚Äôt kill nearly enough for it to be effective. I don‚Äôt think the numbers we killed even exceeded replacement reproduction. If that was the goal, then who ever came up with it wasn‚Äôt very good at math. The war of attrition on Islam is coming, at least in Europe, if not eventually here. That‚Äôs what happens to invading armies that don‚Äôt bother to bring any guns with them, when the natives finally figure out it actually is an invasion.

            If it‚Äôs a war of attrition, the West has real problems: it‚Äôs old, and it‚Äôs infertile.  Islam is young and fertile.  Attrition won‚Äôt work in our favor.

                    We don‚Äôt even have to resort to nukes. We have countless conventional weapons that are capable of dealing massive casualties, and they can all be delivered remotely.

        [‚Ä¶] Conservatives do not succumb directly to the Left; rather, in classic Leftist strategy, they are covertly invaded, divided against themselves, and thus subverted and turned into a vehicle for Leftist ideas. This can be seen in mainstream conservatism through O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs First Law: [‚Ä¶]

        Hated ‚Äúred state‚Äù  upon first hearing of it.  It foolishly confirmed the label that the Liberal Media had stuck on ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù  in 1992.   ‚ÄúRed‚Äù  was always the color of socialism/communism,  and if you weren‚Äôt on the left,  you had to be some kind of brain dead stupid to adopt that color and make it part of your name.
