        The movie Gattica (from 1995, I think) explores designer children and the way society might be modeled around that.Much of the distant-future tech in that movie is happening now.So is the increase in facism.

            There are a few ways to look at genetic engineering. One is to figure out how to improve existing traits. This is unlikely to happen any time soon simply because of the complexity. Right now, we don’t know what we don’t know so it is entirely possible the tools being developed today will be entirely self-defeating in this area.Defect fixing has the highest probability of success. There are a number of maladies that have known genetic causes that can be addressed with the emerging technology. You don’t end up with super-babies, but you eliminate certain defects. This can also be used for fighting cancer, dementia and aging.Then you have screening. Here’s where things can get interesting. What if a simply mouth swab can determine your probability of getting cancer? Ho long before the insurance company demands mouth swabs? How about crime? Imagine if a simple genetic test could tell a couple if their child is more or less likely to be an addict? Or a criminal?

                Scientist in dark labs will find a way to screw this up beyond recognition. Like you said, we don’t even know what we don’t know. Like Icharus (did I spell that right?) flying to close to the sun. Observable reality tells me that you can’t alter one thing without changing another. GMO’s are a prime example. Idk if you ever had any of the drinking water in big Ag states, but the run off from farms makes it so water treatment plants have to treat the water more often than normal. So because these seeds are resistant to pesticides, they encourage even more spraying. That spraying directly affects the drinking water which we need more than anything else (basically tastes like a big gulp of public pool water). all because farmers don’t want to pick weeds. Maybe we should just make do with what God gave us, but of course that makes me a hippy.

                    That’s funny, I was just thinking about that book the other day.  I don’t remember what triggered it, but I remembered the part of BTH where people duel with guns in restaurants, and if you don’t want to duel you wear bright clothes which means you’re inferior.

        I remember reading a sci-fi story once about a world with genetically-altered children. It was from the perspective of a “normal” child who had an IQ high enough to go to a special school that catered mainly to “enhanced” children. The crux of the story was that the “enhanced” children all started to develop serious mental/and or physical problems right around the time they hit puberty. (It’s been many years so I don’t remember the exact details.) The huge hormonal changes of teenagers wrecked havoc on their genetically-enhanced minds and bodies.

        &gt; No one wants their kid to be a stumpy troll, even if the parents are stumpy trolls.
I wouldn’t be too sure of that.  There will be a percentage of virtue signalling identitarians who want the child to be as “differently abled” as they are — see for examplehttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1916462.stm

            Stumpy trolls want their children to be stumpy trolls, strangely enough. The dwarf community has already spoken on that issue. As have the deaf. They also want to be subsidized of course. Still, Zman is not wrong. The day is coming when everybody is as good looking as I am.

        I’m more interested in gut bacteria. The development of antibiotics eradicates some diseases, but kills off beneficial gut bacteria. That creates a compromised immune system which is susceptible to new diseases. And also probably fuels the obesity problem. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.

        Well, we already know where “genetic engineering” will lead us, because we practice it every day in the form of dog breeding.  Watch any “Dogs 101” episode on Animal Planet, and you’ll get a good idea of where this is all likely to head.  Why do we have so many different kinds of dogs?  Because we screw around with their genetic milkshakes in an attempt to produce breeds with characteristics which serve our needs.  Dachshunds were bread to crawl down inside varmint holes, for example, hence their tube-like stature.  But, if you watch Dogs 101 with a discerning eye, you’ll also notice that this breeding creates all kinds of other problems.  Some dogs are prone to very short lifespans, for example, and this is generally tied to the size of the animal.Do you want an 8-foot tall offspring in exchange for him dying at 35 of old age?Life has trade-offs like that.  We see it in medicine too.  My old migraine medicine (one of the first true ones on the market) was like a miracle drug.  In many ways, I got my life back.  BUT, the side effects were pretty bad (dizziness, neck pain, nausea, etc.).  The newer medicines don’t have this, but there are always some trade-offs.  We’re not even completely sure how different medicines interact with each other.  Genetic engineering might show some promise, particularly with things like cancer treatments, where the target is focused.  But breeding of humans to produce certain traits and qualities?Well, I’ve got some bad news for you because that’s one milkshake that ain’t easy to make.More likely what we’ll see is the prevalence of genetic disorders decreasing.  That’s one of the main reasons the government is so fond of abortion.  Down Syndrome children are expensive and a drain on society from Nancy Pelosi’s perspective.  She even gave an interview about it, and why “family planning” is so important for the government to invest in.  My wife is a pediatrician, and the older docs (those near retirement) often talk about how little medicine they actually have to practice today.  Between vaccinations and preventative care, outside of the occasional train wreck case, they’re mainly doing sports physicals and treating seasonal flu/RSV.  Science is converging towards a steady state where illness is actually unusual.Because of this, we’re going to see a population die-off within the next 100 years.  We’re already seeing it in places like Russia and Japan, the latter of which is rapidly turning into a Long Term Care Facility.  As the human race sort of tops out around 7-8B residents, and everyone gets more wealthy, we’ll see technology shift towards extending human life (which in turn will reduce the reproductive impulse), and comfort/leisure technology.  We’re not going to have to muck around with genetically modified babies too much because, well, most people won’t feel the need to produce them.

            One of the things I find frustrating with many of the people into HBD is their reductionism. Yes, simplifying the world into easily understood components is what science does, but it is a tool, not an end. The universe remains maddeningly complex even when we are able to model many parts of it. Complexity has a quality of its own. Anyone who has worked with large complex systems like software knows this.

            If we keep feeding Africa, they’re going to keep having babies. That’s how hunter-gatherers behave—population increase right up to the max carrying capacity, and then warfare between tribes to kill off some males and create some cushion.
Which would be fine, except we are continually increasing the carrying capacity.
Africans number 1 billion now, and unless something is done (cough cough) they will quadruple before the close of this century.
