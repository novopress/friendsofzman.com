        “Then we have the totally insane idea that accurately mentioning the race of someone is racist.”Well, you see, that’s what the definition of “Racist” has become to folks of a “certain” level of intellect.“Higher” academic apologists call it “usage”.

        Someone should come up with a grammer book, like who and when the use of words like nappy haired hos, etc. can be used. It would save a lot of time and grief. The way we are doing it is like hitting the secret word on “You Bet Your Life”, only it costs money. It would be a lot quicker.
I once thought the police should just send my son a couple seat belt tickets a year, it would save time and frustation.

        We certainly don’t want to mention that hoodiewearinghettorats are comminting crimes.  That would be racist.
