            Maybe. I‚Äôve been leaning in that direction for years now, but recent developments do not fit that narrative. The Flynn case directly contradicts that narrative. Barr could easily have made that go away without fanfare. The judge could have cut off Flynn‚Äôs attorney at anytime.

                        You got a problem with GIs? Dissing G-men and armed government workers I can see but GIs? Are you too stupid realize that you sleep safely in your bedSOLELYbecause those ‚Äúrough men‚Äù (and women) stand ready in the night to do violence upon your behalf? Best get down on your knees and thank your Creator for those ‚ÄúGIs‚Äù present and past who were stupid enough to raise their right hand and put their tender asses on the line for the likes of you.

                            All of those GIs have been trained to do exactly as they are told.  Most, if not the vast majority of those GIs will do exactly as they are told.  When they are told to do violence upon us rather than upon our behalf, they will do as they are told.

Look, I am from a family full of combat vets and other vets. The son of a vet. I also am familiar with the military‚Äôs riot control protocols. When and if martial law is declared, the soldier becomes the cop. Minus what is left of a concept once known as ‚Äúdue process‚Äù.
Instead of being a LEO/military fanboi, being a realistic adult might be advisable. Read up on some of the doings during Katrina for a wake up call.
Nobody gonna save you but you.

                                I was there during Katrina ‚Äî shortly after the storm blew through.  I ran a small Taskforce.  There was overreach by the military organizations early on, and things surely unconstitutional (there was no declaration of martial law).  There was also a lot of ineptitude and stupidity involved.  And contrary to the statement above tarring all military leaders and their subordinates, there was substantial and successful push back by military personnel against what was occurring ‚Äî both in organization and operations of the military forces on the ground there.  Enough said.

                            Perhaps this was a troll. It was just so over the top ridiculous.  However, assuming it‚Äôs not, the US military hasn‚Äôt defended the country or it‚Äôs citizenry since about anyone on this forum has been alive.  Iraq?  Afghanistan?  Vietnam?  All pointless wastes for the benefits of some other country or perhaps a small sub group in this country. USMC veteran here and I wills state the obvious, that being we could cut the DOD budget in half and not sacrifice a bit of security.

I don‚Äôt see our military on the border, I see them still occupying Germany, Japan, Korea, etc. What partying in Germany or invading the Middle East on has to do with doing violence on *my* behalf, I have no idea.

                            Give me a friggin break.We sleep safely in our bed SOLELY because those GIs have been protecting us?There hasn‚Äôt been a SINGLE war since maybe WW2 that was not optional.  Not one single enemy since WW2 ever REALLY threatened this country externally.The threats have been INTERNAL ‚Äì and continue to be so. If this country falls ‚Äì it will because of INTERNAL threats-  with one of the most prominent ones being the absolutely absurd amount of money that has been spent on all of those foreign wars you apparently believe were indispensable to our safety.We were never really threatened by Korean commies.  We were never really threatened by Vietnamese commies.  We were not really threatened by Iraq, and we were never really threatened by Afghanis.Skiping back past WW2,  we weren‚Äôt even really threatened by anything going on in Europe ‚Äì but that didn‚Äôt stop the empire builders from seeing opportunity and thrusting this nation directly into that morass.There are very good historical arguments that the US becoming involved in WW1 ‚Äì directly led to the disaster that was WW2.  (Without US involvement there might not have been the punishment of Germany that led directly to the Nazis coming into power) So if that‚Äôs true ‚Äì then maybe it‚Äôs all those GIs that should bear some of the blame for the tens of millions that later died.Here‚Äôs the thing:  ‚ÄúGI‚Äù is a term for a soldier who fights FOR the Federal Government.  The founders of this country very clearly said ‚ÄúNO STANDING ARMY‚Äù ‚Äì so all of those GIs you love so much ‚Äì are acting in direct contradiction to the wishes of the founders.  They should have been back in their home states ‚Äì drilling in their militias ‚Äì and not giving over their bodies to be used as tools for empire building.  Because of what they did ‚Äì we stand where we are now:  TRILLIONS of dollars in debt, overrun by foreigners , a hollowed out industrial base, and a completely corrupted government.So why don‚Äôt you try again and convince me how I should be thanking those GI‚Äôs so profusely for my ‚Äúsafety‚Äù ‚Äì because I can‚Äôt seem to find the safety you claim they fought for ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. AT ALL.  Not physical safety, not political safety, and not financial safety.Your GIs FAILED.

Its short bus , eating Tide Pods window licking stupid.Not to put too fine a point on it, at no point since 1812 has the US faced a serious risk of invasion from anyone.  H-Bombs made  sure of that for the long haulThese days  the US military has been almost entirely  solving other nations problems for them and functioning as corporate and globalist welfare .If you can name a single war we needed to be in, other than Grenada maybe I‚Äôd be shocked.And yes this includes The Great War and its aftermath, WW2 .

                        Majority of ‚Äúveterans‚Äù today served in administrative and logistics units. These are folks who signed up with the military because industry and the private sector didn‚Äôt want to hire them. They‚Äôve never experienced combat.Normies see these ‚Äúveterans‚Äù skipping ahead of them in civilian life with the added safety cushion of government benefits which normies do not enjoy but pay for. The veterans often do not perform as well in civilian life as the normie who has worked in a field performs yet the veterans are promoted ahead because they know how to work a system, appear extraordinarily loyal to the organization and its leadership, and they enjoy ‚Äúveteran‚Äù status (‚Äúthank you for your service!‚Äù).Normie is redpilling on their neighbor the mercenary for Globohomo, the Saudis, London bankers, China Inc., and Israel/NYC/Hollywood/Epstein Resorts.

                    It is hard to know with Barr. His role in Ruby Ridge was typical of defenders of the system. On the other hand, he seems to have a hard-on for Clinton. Thus far, the focus from his department has been on Clinton partisans, not Obama partisans. That‚Äôs the important thing to keep in mind. No matter what comes of this, it will not be driven by virtue. It‚Äôs all about insider politics.

                        I would be more hopeful if Barr and Durham were actually rolling up the hierarchy.  That‚Äôs typically how you break conspiracies like this.  Strozk and Page both should be looking at jail time.  Instead, it‚Äôs been a lot of hot air.

Before that he worked in the CIA, doing CIA type stuff (just like his Daddy.) After that he‚Äôs been promoting the corporate-government partnership.  Just do a ‚Äúsearch‚Äù on him.

{sigh} I do not believe that such activity will be reducedEVEN WITHserious consequences (which Ido notconsider at all likely). Severity of penalties does not deter proscribed behavior. Penalties deter behavior only to the degree that they are likely to accrue to a given act. It is the likelihood of successful prosecution and not the severity of penalties which modifies behavior. In the real world, no act is truly illegal unless the perpetrator is successfully prosecuted for it.

                    True.  Severity minus probability of punishment is of course problematic.  What the public sees is that ostensibly ‚Äúgood‚Äù people are preyed upon, and the ramifications quite severe when one tries to go against the swamp.  But the ramifications for being a swamp monster are never apparent.  In the end, the lesson is learned for the common folk‚Äîbend the knee or else.

                I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a two-tiered justice system. I think there are two entirely separate justice systems ‚Ä¶. not notional, but in fact and act. They just work to keep up the fiction that the constitution is a functional and meaningful document. This (1) to placate / sooth the normie / CIVNATs; (2) to afford them legal structures they can use against us (i.e., strangle us with our own legal code, a code we yet strive to respect and uphold), and (3) to use parts to protect themselves as they go about destroying us.It‚Äôs not that there is a two tiered system here, it‚Äôs that they have their own legal system entirely. Hillary has no reckoning for her classified email crimes because ‚Ä¶.. in their minds and system, it‚Äôs just not a crime to run a game like that against a people who are so obviously underclass ‚Äî us. I bet they can‚Äôt even figure out what all our fuss is about. Of course she can do that; she‚Äôs one of the anointed.

                I find the statement ‚Äúthings Trump gets no credit for‚Äù to be used so often that wonder why people on our side don‚Äôt cut him more slack for the job he is doing under such extenuating circumstances.

                        Tarstarkas.  I think there is another aspect.  Folks fail to understand/accept what is politically possible under the guise of working within the system and therefore have unrealistic expectations.Trump has said/promised little more than most of the other lying, corrupt pol‚Äôs on the election trail, albeit not very eloquently.  Difference is, instead of getting elected and simply ignoring those promises, he has attempted to work around the system‚Äîbut within the system (if that makes sense)‚Äîto implement such.  We seem to expect that 40 years+ of corrupt government can be turned on a dime.  Unfortunately, it can not.What Trump may achieve is only that he has exposed the system for what it has been for decades.  Hopelessly unfixable through the democratic processes the Founders envisioned.

                            Compsci, I think your analysis is pretty good.  One thing to add is that the WN types thought Trump was some sort of white crusader.  How they ever thought this is baffling. They usually have nothing good to say about Trump.  The perfect is the enemy of the good.  Trump is the best we can get right now.

                                I have had great success (in amusing myself) with White never-Trumpers in agreeing with them wrt to Trump‚Äîand then in consoling them‚Äîwith the fact that there will never be another Republican elected to the office, and perhaps never (at least in our lifetimes) another White male elected to the office.How does that amuse me?  Well, these jerks are literally stunned‚Äîlike you hit them with a board in the face‚Äîwhen they hear this pronouncement.  These ‚Äúnormies‚Äù have never gotten out of the 80‚Äôs, our at least the Bush years.  They think politics is like a pendulum and their *savior conservative* will be elected one cycle or the next.  They just got to keep trying.Brother in law is like that.  I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs stupid.  He simply can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt accept the end to his very culture and reason for existence.  Fascinating.

                    Speaking for the people who see stopping massive immigration as our biggest issue, Trump raised expectations very high and then expended very little effort or political capital on it.
All other problems approach insignificance compared to massive immigration, so ‚Äúthings Trump gets no credit for‚Äù really don‚Äôt add up to much.

                I‚Äôd push back on the notion that Trump has discredited the media.
The media was already discredited to anyone remotely right of center.  The reaction to Corona proves that most will still believe what they are told.

                    Perhaps. In the area of politics, things have changed, but Gell-Mann Amnesia is real. Right-wing sportsball fans still unquestioningly believe the sportsball press, despite thinking all political media is fake news.

                            The support of Blue State authoritarians wrt Coronachan is as much for the medical profession as for the political class these authoritarians represent.What was the greatest concern in every discussion about socialized medicine in the last 30 year?  ‚ÄúIf I like my doctor, can I keep my doctor?‚Äù  People have a great respect for the medical profession and trust their doctor to work in their best interests.As with the perennial ‚Äúclimate change debate‚Äù, folks used to have a great respect for scientists and in general ‚ÄúScientism‚Äù.  That is today much less of a case and any number of eyes have been opened as to the human foibles scientists are prone too.  Similarly, the mask (pun intended) is off of our medical profession and we are seeing just how fallible they are wrt their advice and predictions.For the dissident right, this can not be Bad.  One thing we pride ourselves on is thinking for ourselves.  Hell, we claw at each other on this forum over our ideas and recommendations.   üòâ

            The blogger Whiskey used to have good stuff up about how students from schools like Carnegie Mellon and Harvey Mudd were regularly cleaning the clocks of those in the Ivies and near-Ivies in every measurable area. Of course, the reason to go to these exclusive schools is for the advantages conferred which not only are not measurable but can‚Äôt even really be mentioned. If you get jammed up or caught at something and the judge was the oar behind you on the rowing team, you might have a better shot in a case. ‚ÄúI went to school with your son‚Äù probably gets things bigger than parking tickets shredded.

                ‚ÄúThese exclusive schools‚Äù haven‚Äôt been exclusive for years;-)  I am a graduate of one of these and there were a few daughters/granddaughters of early grads in my class, what today are termed ‚Äúlegacies,‚Äù but probably not more than 20%.  Their presence was actually an asset for the school, as it gave the newbies an opportunity to learn the ways of the elite, their stylistic tastes, manner of speaking, sports preferences and the liberal arts academic pursuits that would serve them well in their lives after college, including multiple opportunities to meet someone of the opposite sex AND similar background.Also considered a form of legacy, but now pretty much gone, are the college alumni clubs that used to exist in cities across the country, not just the big ones in New York and Washington that would host after-work cocktail parties in-town at a ‚Äúuniversity club‚Äù with a speaker from the college.Here‚Äôs an example of the second part of the legacy I‚Äôm talking about: an attractive young couple, Thomas Jones, Jr., Dartmouth College ‚Äô62, and his wife Sallie Jackson Jones, Smith College ‚Äô65, would move to St. Louis where he had landed a job with a big aerospace company.  She would be at home with their young children, but was grateful that the local Smith College Club was excited to have her join.  Sallie was quite a bit younger than most of the members; some of whom even knew her mother at Smith!  The club depended on its volunteers to sell hundreds of bags of pecans for Smith scholarships each year at Thanksgiving, so she got to meet lots of people doing this.  The Dartmouth Club was active in interviewing high school guys as candidates for the school and raised money every year for scholarships.  Word was out that there was an inner-city kid who would be a great asset to the football team if accepted.  It helped that the headmaster of the country day school was a Dartmouth alum, and the Jones‚Äô little boy was accepted in the First Grade Class of the Country Day School.  Sallie was asked to serve as Class Mother.  And so on thru the years until about 2000.The difference between then and now is that today there are not that many high level corporate jobs in places like St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, which were important ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù towns for the Ivy League and Seven Sisters colleges.  Graduates used to get a job right after college in NYC (Time-Life!), Boston or D. C., where all the ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù were, but then get serious about life and return home to the nest and the perfectly acceptable standards of living in these towns ‚Äî super real estate for not much $$, great cultural institutions, excellent private AND public schools, neat clubs to join and so forth.  Plus, enough cash left over to get a place in Naples FL eventually.  What‚Äôs not to like?Well, the offspring of these families no longer care a bit about the old home town and prefer to hang out with silly bureaucrat losers like Andrew McCabe or Sally Yates in Washington D. C. or work as law-yahs for the Southern District of NY.  There has been a huge social breakdown of the former Establishment in the past fifty years, probably in large part due to women becoming a majority in the professional class of the workforce, no longer content to serving as the volunteer backbone of communities that they once were ‚Äî or really caring about their kids, except as status markers by getting into the aforementioned schools.  A twenty-years‚Äô older Wellesley grad Hillary Clinton might have ended up as President of the Chicago Junior League back in the day.  She and the world would be a lot better off if that had happened IMO.  Of course the colleges are thrilled that there are so many important alums now to tap for contributions, although the jury is still out on whether these clowns even contribute much to their alma maters.  Now there‚Äôs an investigation worth having!!

Eric Weinstein (PHD matematics Harvard, managing director of Theil Capital)  would probably disagree. Had an excellent interview with J.D. Vance of ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy‚Äù fame; both thought this:
Top Ivy league colleges are 50/50; half legacy students who just want the feather in the cap but could care less about it, really.  Other half are the truly brilliant, and need to be nurtured as a precious resource.
Problem:  The legacy half is quickly superseding the brilliant part.  It‚Äôs a real issue, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much stopping it.

                    Unz carried a recent analysis. 6% of merit-matriculation CalTech students were small hat wearers. 26% of Harvard undergrads claimed the caps.That‚Äôs 20% small hat nepotism at Harvard, where the student numbers are greater than CalTech. Right there is where authentic elite status ends and the end was in sight circa 1960.My wife is a Harvard prodigy, my nephews graduated Ivies, the youngest was a Princeton football stud, I have close family teaching at Ivies including Harvard, and many in my family excelled at MIT. It‚Äôs not bitter grapes on my part when I say the caliber of ‚Äúelite‚Äù students today ‚Äì those who are American citizens ‚Äì is not elite in terms of performance.As with the Beltway, they know people, which is the sole reason why they were admitted.

            The problem with the long march through the institutions is that its replacement was and will be  the long slower march through the institutions.Trump doesn‚Äôt get the kudos many seem to think he deserves because he takes one step forward followed by 2 steps backwards especially when it comes to demographic replacement.  We are faced with 30+ million unemployed and his temporary halt to immigration was very very temporary not even lasting a single day.  When things open up again so will the floodgates. Under the present circumstances this isn‚Äôt simply a policy shift, it‚Äôs bordering on being a treasonous act against legacy America.Anyone other than the based tweeter-in-chief doing this would have people marching on state capitals and down both ends of Pennsylvania Ave‚Ä¶especially if they were members of the D-Party.Our tribe despite all this talk of being high agency seems to need to have their backs the wall and the wolf at the door before they are able to find the agency they need.

        Back in my teaching days, a colleague asked me to help him move this antique couch his wife had just purchased. I showed up at their house, and could see the problem straight off ‚Äî the couch was 40‚Ä≥ (or whatever it was) at its narrowest point, while the doorway was 35‚Ä≥ (or whatever). I‚Äôll never forget the look my buddy gave me. Long story short, the wife ‚Äî who, like him, taught microbiology at the local university ‚Äî simplywould not acceptthe self-evident fact that the couch wouldn‚Äôt fit.We showed her the tape measure, walked the damn thing up to the door so she could see the fit, everything, but‚Ä¶ nope. Wouldn‚Äôt hear of it. For the sake of my buddy‚Äôs marriage, I had to help him shove that damn thing at the door until it started to splinter. Only then ‚Äî when this nice antique couch was audibly cracking under the strain ‚Äî did she finally storm off in a huff, to demand that the guy who sold it to her come back, haul it away, and refund her money.Again: This woman had a PhD in microbiology. Taught it to students at the local cow college. The point is this: When you get people isolated in an environment like a college campus for so long, their grasp on reality becomes very, very tenuous. I‚Äôm sure she was competent enough in the lab, but outside of it, her life was 100% make-believe ‚Äî nothing but the silly little word games and more-radical-than-thou posturing of academia. Nothing else mattered, because nothing had any real-world consequences.That‚Äôs our governing class. They‚Äôve tried for generations now to make the Imperial Capital into a giant college campus, and may God have mercy on all of us, they have succeeded.

            ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she was competent enough in the lab‚Ä¶‚ÄùMy experience with these types leads me to extrapolate their stupidity, and not assume competence. That is why no one is coming to save you. With the exception of the most intricate procedures, you need to be your own general practitioner, orthopedist, auto mechanic, lawyer ‚Ä¶. and so on. I have plenty of life experience that backs up my views, in my life of course as I am sure someone here knows a surgeon that can change his oil.Right.Look at that blinking nerd Fauci, passing the buck under Rand Paul‚Äôs questioning today. Putting mouth breathing nerds like this in charge of the country (world), what could go wrong?

        Yes, the Democrats are increasingly being led by fanatics, most of whom seem to be women. Perhaps we are getting an overdose of estrogen in our politics. I got into a heated argument the other day with a young college girl about her zany plan to go to Africa as part of a Christian ministry to save blacks and bring them out of poverty. Didn‚Äôt she want to get married first and have children? Not really. She wants to adopt. I didn‚Äôt ask her which race she was planning to bring home. Oh, and she loves Jesus. And probably considers herself a conservative. Yes, Zman, these people are walking, talking fanatics imbued with the fervor of multi-cult Marxist religious faith. They are grain that will be finely ground in the leftist mills.

            Ask here where in the New Testament is she commanded to heal the world and bring Africans out of poverty.‚ÄúYe are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.‚ÄùYes, Paul recommends chastity, but only if you are pursuing it for the Lord, not for your own virtue signaling (and that‚Äôs likely the reason she‚Äôs doing this, otherwise she‚Äôd be helping her *neighbors* instead of travelling across the world).‚ÄúThere is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit‚ÄùAs for she loves Jesus ‚Äì the failure of the English language to have different distinctions for the word Love is one of the biggest failures ever, as it makes it very easy for the enemy to equate God‚Äôs love with the more earthly kinds.

Straight, cousin waited until she was age 40 to get married. (A boring but sweet tax guy Z‚Äôs age.)At the wedding reception, my cousin announced several times the couple was trying for their first baby and expected to share good news within a few months.That was six years ago and SURPRISE! no babies have issued. Cuz and her similarly situated, beautiful and intelligent sister will not be having a family. A thing they used to enthusiastically share as youngsters were quips and quotes from the TV show SEX IN THE CITY.The programming, it worked! 40 is the new 30 you know. Oh wait, it isn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶.

                Yep.This is reaching a boiling point though.The Internet and the fact that vast parts of the population live alone and without kids dampens the response. Its more selfish ‚ÄúHow do I pay my bills‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if I get COVID19‚Äù and less ‚Äúwhat about my family.‚ÄùIn Michigan, armed militia have made it clear that attempting to arrest an old barber will result in a confrontation.There have been plenty of protests too, not covered by Prada or Izvestia oh I mean US media.California is opening bit by bit, beaches and such and at least where I live no one plays outside anyway so its moot.Ultimately most people still have hope and if/when things do not return to anything approach normal economically and everyone is broke?I‚Äôd expect a massive magnification of problems.If Dissidents are thinking ahead , they‚Äôll be thinking about how to leverage this  to get power or at least changing their mindset so that they want power.

        The epidemic of criminality that occurred during the Obama Administration cannot be overstated, and it was both vast and extremely damaging. The domestic spying and Flynn persecution capers were small potatoes compared to what‚Äôs still hiding in the closet. The Uniparty principals scammed hundreds of millions in bribes and payouts from all over the planet, selling everything including the kitchen sink. That is what they continue to hide because revelation either leads to prison time or a civil war. Will justice prevail? Don‚Äôt know, but Obama‚Äôs flop sweat is real.

            The cogdis buffer established when goodhwites vote in joggers is substantial.How many mayors and other .gov AA grifters have been launched into the local tributary by enthusiastic post-racial, colorblind prog whites only to have the tide reverse and fill their town, city, county, state with brackish swamp water more akin to the horn of Africa? Then, how many of those get re-elected?The cult of anti-racism is not just evil because it demands generations of white kids to be tossed into the diversity is our strength volcano, but because once those kids are tossed in (with every vote), the parents can never reverse their twisted beliefs without indicting themselves for their obvious treason.So the joggers keep jogging.And the joggers know this about their suicidal keepers. Which is why they can be so emboldened and entitled in the face of ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that readily reveal their grift and inadequacies.Should the cogdis buffer get strained, the NYT/NPR loop will fatten them back up. Plenty of films or tv shows coming out just in time to help them teach their sons a valuable lesson about race as mentioned upthread too.The dreams of my father cult is real. Justice to these people is only a balance sheet in which whiteness is deeply indebted. To sully Saint Obama would require melting the amygdalae of a great many normies. Thats the real front in this war.

        Very interesting times ahead.
Seems like the ‚ÄúAhmaud Arbery‚Äù case is some kind of diversion, perhaps as a threat to Trump that there is a direct possibility of violent black riots if Obama is locked up.
Surprisingly, the first jogger president also oversees standards that are just as corrupt as Africa. But let‚Äôs see what happens.
I still don‚Äôt trust anything. When they start getting locked up I‚Äôll start to cautiously believe that something is actually happening.

            Trump is just a piece of shit who got lucky. I‚Äôd love to see riots under his watch but he‚Äôll probably do the usual: demoralize and discourage 10% of the white vote to get each 1% of the black vote:https://mobile.twitter.com/blompf2020/status/1260053144920350720

                    Look, I get the desperate hope to see Trump redeem himself, to prove himself, to discover that we really do have an ally in the White House, but it‚Äôs not going to happen. Time to move on‚Ä¶ we laugh at how MAGAbots get excited at each supposedly imminent ‚Äúown‚Äù or ‚Äúwin‚Äù Trump seems poised to deliver, only to be betrayed and then desperately explain it away, but this comment section has fallen prey to the same pathetic mood swings: ‚Äúthis time he‚Äôll really come around!‚ÄùAside from trashing the MSM, which he does deserve credit for, what accomplishments set him apart from what will be the usual mediocrity under the incoming Biden presidency? Just as Trump largely continued Obama era crap (who in turn continued Bush era crap), you can bet that with the media heat off, Biden‚Äôs caregivers will largely continue Trump era half-assedness.I get the impulse to rally around a leader who constantly seems like he‚Äôs on the cusp of getting his shit together, but you‚Äôre just setting yourself up for crushing disappointment again and again, like a battered housewife. The impending downvotes will reveal all the bruised housewives who really think the punches are about to stop.

                            I agree with you completely, Lineman: let‚Äôs just look after our own. 2016 was a ‚Äúfool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me‚Äù moment for me. It was probably naive of me to think Trump would accomplish something in 2016, but I‚Äôve learned my lesson since then: disengage completely from politics. I‚Äôm now more focused on quietly converting friends than rooting for any political team.Neither Team Obama nor Gen. Flynn care about me, so I don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about who triumphs over the other. Neither Biden nor Trump give a rat‚Äôs ass about me so I don‚Äôt care who triumphs anymore. Neither presidential committees led by Hunter Biden nor Javanka will do anything for me, so I don‚Äôt root for any of them. Neither the GOP nor the Dems care about me. I took Z‚Äôs message, often repeated in his podcasts, to heart: we‚Äôre not going to solve our problems politically. So I‚Äôve disengaged from the political theatrics in Washington entirely. I don‚Äôt care about their tit-for-tat games or who is about to triumph over the other.I don‚Äôt care if Flynn is vindicated. I don‚Äôt care what Barr does. None of these people care about me, so I don‚Äôt care about them and I‚Äôm not going to be swayed by or return to any vestigial cheerleading whenever ‚Äúour side‚Äù in Washington seem like they‚Äôre about to score a political victory for themselves, but not for me. Trump has been a handicap: our organization has stagnated because we‚Äôre constantly waiting on him to do something. So I don‚Äôt look to him or to his supposed opponents for answers or ideas anymore.

        ‚ÄúWhy are all of these people risking their freedom to maintain an obvious lie?‚Äù Talking to someone at a heavy hitting publishing outlet might go a long way toward answering this questions. There‚Äôs a decent mail-order sort of market for ‚ÄúFighting the Deep State‚Äù books to feed the Breitbart crowd, but all the big advances and feting and distribution is going to the ‚ÄúRussian Roulette‚Äù style books. Most mid-list and small publishers use print on demand, but if you‚Äôve got a warehouse full of books with a CIA spook‚Äôs face on the cover touting him as a hero, the incentive to keep up the charade of him as a hero is financial and very real both for him and a lot of other people. This stuff is not just a big lie, but a lie with a subsidiary industry attached to it. You watch; the same refusal to retract or climb down will happen with Corona, especially with someone like Fauci, whose face will be gracing a hardcover featuring him staring off into the distance with some block letter title like: ‚ÄúFauci‚Äôs Fight: My Quest to Stop Donald Trump‚Äôs War on Science.‚Äù Throw in book tours and speaking engagements, some Think Tank sinecures, and you‚Äôre talking millions of dollars.

        No need for conspiracy when simple flocking behavior explains observed phenomena adequately. I don‚Äôt know if the parties in this mess truly qualify as ‚Äúfanatics‚Äù but I think you‚Äôd have to agree that they inarguably were/are true believers. The ZMan wrote about it last Wednesday in his piece titled ‚ÄúThe Ruling System‚Äù. Washington is so inbred these days it is like Japan. I spent some time (3 1/2 years) in Japan and observed Japanese society. Japan is ethnically and culturally homogeneous to a degree a typical American would find staggering. Even before the Left opened the floodgates of immigration we in the U.S. were never so homogeneous as Japan. A fad which might take several months to sweep the U.S. will sweep Japan in a few days to a couple of weeks. Then it burns out just as quickly.From what I have seen and read (including the ZMan‚Äôs blog I referenced above) official Washington is very nearly as homogeneous ‚Äì in some ways ‚Äì as Japan. For that reason I see no need to posit fanaticism on the part of the actors in the activities our host wrote about in today‚Äôs blog. All I see needed is a sufficiently large group of true believers and basic flocking behavior. The ZMan mentioned the lack of love between the Obama and Clinton camps. Certainly Obama‚Äôs people had no great love for HRC. But they self-evidentlyloathed and despisedTrump to the very depths of their being. If ‚ÄúThe enemy of my enemy is my friend.‚Äù, then the Obama and Clinton camps were positively soul mates. As we have seen in the last 4 years, there is absolutely no stop the true believers will not pull out in their monomaniacal drive to rid themselves of the ultimate evil personified by the ‚ÄúOrange Man‚Äù.

            Obama blew it when he had to depend on Hillary to get elected to protect and prolong his game, even though they were not really allies.  That mistake is not being made this time around.  That‚Äôs why Biden is being kept on, despite his gropy dementia.  Biden is wholly and irreversibly owned by Obama‚Äôs people, and they will ride that horse and take their chances, rather than risk depending on outsiders again.

        The old adage about three can keep a secret if two are dead does not apply here.This is a self-serving lie perpetuated by liars and crooks to hand waive away any conspiracies uncovered by people not supposed to know these things.  If people couldn‚Äôt keep secrets, why bother classifying any state secrets? People conspire to do evil all the time. Conspiracy is probably the most common criminal charge.The reason none of them are talking is they haven‚Äôt been threatened with RICO and other such charges that come with prison terms designed to loosen the lips of the person being charged.  Let‚Äôs see how brave these people are when they are facing 40 years in the federal pen!  If these kinds of sentences can loosen the lips of cold blooded killers, the cat-women of the inner party will be singing like birds!

        Been meaning to sign up here for a while, thanks for putting all this effort into providing an oasis of sanity in the vast desert of blasted imbecility.I used to imagine there were smart string-pullers at some level of the hierarchy, able to observe reality and make reasonable, if self-serving, decisions. The last couple months have demonstrated definitively that we are allowing ourselves to be led by morons. They are ideologues for sure but they are also fundamentally effeminate and therefore suffer the utter deficiencies in the power of reasoning that have been observed and commented upon for thousands of years. I think that should be kept in mind when considering how to destroy their power.

            &gt;fundamentally effeminateWell, sort of. I think the really dangerous issue is weakness, or self-proclaimed-but-genuinely-believed weakness, the latter which is even worse. The Captain America narrative where (Jewish, of course) scientist Abraham Erskine tells Steve Rogers that he was selected because he was physically weak is the prime example of the weakness=virtue myth:This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.This is bullshit. Many weak men have complexes and neuroses because of their weakness (be it physical or psychological) and cannot be trusted with power or authority because they are full of jealousy, envy, and the desire for revenge. A person who has grown up in a culture where he has been taught from birth that every other group is out to get him, hates him, wants to kill him, is not going to be a stable person. We have a generally low-IQ group that has been told that whitey is out to get him, despite decades of evidence to the contrary. They are a problem, but not as big a problem as the generally high-IQ group that has been inculcated with tales of genocide, and how people would gleefully turn him into soap, or a lampshade, if they got the chance.The problem with this ‚ÄúI am weak, I am a victim‚Äù mentality is that it gives moral justification for nearly any terrible thing you might choose to do. Because you are NOT the aggressor, you‚Äôre merely punching back, defending yourself, defending your people. Why, you‚Äôre the real hero in all this drama. A society run by self-proclaimed victims (look who creates our modern mythology[1]) is a monstrous thing.[1] yeah, I mean modern mythology. How many people don‚Äôt know at least the outlines of the Captain American creation myth? We talk about comic book movies these days the way our (or your) forebears might have said, ‚ÄúJust like in that story where Thor tried to pick up the cat that turned out to be the Midgaard serpent‚Äù or ‚Äúlike Odysseus stuffing the ears of his sailors with wax to defeat the Sirens.‚Äù

        The long march by whom and for what purpose‚Ä¶10s of millions now understand the whom on this side of the  pond‚Ä¶, 100+ million get it ‚Äòover there‚Äô.Trump most closely mirrors BJ Clinton including the nationalist sentiments yet he is out of favor?  As would be BJ if he were to bring his ‚Äô90s act to 2020.  20 years ago the political class still had to offer something to the white majority.  That long march through the institutions is over. To be making the same kinds of overtures that were necessary 20 years ago is a faux pas and an unnecessary raising of the dead.  Trump‚Äôs nationalist rhetoric during the 2016 campaign turned the quiet and embarrassing  internal conversation millions of whites were having with themselves into a very public discussion.The ruling class had already dug YT‚Äôs grave and was sowing it with lime and then that brash NY‚Äôer shot his mouth off.  95% of all the good whites from the upper 5th quintile had embraced their role as part of a new ruling coalition. Suddenly millions upon millions of those left behind had a sense of not being the only one thinking bad thoughts.  The ruling caste began to wonder if the grave they had dug would turn out to be their own.  Growing white collective identity is the funeral march for all the progressive fantasies of the past 7 decades.Interests are too vested. Unnatural alliances too strongly bonded since the old ones are all but dead. There is no undoing so much that is decay and decadence. Radicalization and fanaticism are survival strategies for the ruling class. That is who they are and who they will remain until the rope is placed around their necks.

This is a real problem because these people are your white, upper middle class demographic that make $75k-300k per annum and have broad social networks and a fair amount of influence in their communities. I also see them as the demographic that is still most willing to swallow the Establishment narrative hook, line, and sinker.

        One thing left out is that the government got a subpoena to monitor network traffic from Trump tower over a manufactured interaction between the Trump organization and a Russian bank.  All modern corporate phone systems are voice over IP.  By monitoring network traffic out of that building, they would have had all of the voice traffic as well as the ‚Äúbanking transactions‚Äù.  Maybe that is one of the reasons that the Trump organization vacated the tower so precipitously after the briefing from the head of the NSA..

            Trump knew they were spying on him and mentioned as much on more than one occasion before any of the shenanigans saw daylight. Of course it was played as Trump bluster and obvious paranoia. He‚Äôs crazy! Unstable!The thing that worries me more than the crimes here is that a lot of people are just like the media: they hate trump more than they value the truth.So even as this evil scheme gets dragged out of the shadows, too many normies still think the actions may have been wrong, but necessary to save ‚Äúour democracy‚Äù from literally Hitler.This goes all the way to Obama. When it becomes clear he was directing it, those same normies, led by their favorite media clowns, will claim the Trump team is manufacturing all of this because conspiracy theories. And raciss.Just like how the covid is playing out. People know it is BS but still have to Orange Man Bad, so they don‚Äôt make a fuss otherwise they support trump.This issue reveals the real treason: whites working against their own interests all for the cheap payout of social status chits from the prog hive.

                The truth is irrelevant now.  Many people seek out the ‚Äúproper‚Äù story and frame, and then trumpet it, and that frame does not need to bear any relationship with the truth.  The question is why.I think that goes to a very bright line being drawn in the cultural sand, and people understand that their long term success and prosperity (especially when they depend on social relationships for their personal wealth, rather than an actual skill set) depends on being on the correct side of the line.  They will parrot out anything that conforms to that positioning, if they are told to do so.For their part, the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù leadership and political class suffers from their personal benefits and wealth being supplied by social relationships rather than actual skills as well, so they play this game in a truly committed fashion.  Now that they have stepped way over the legal line in trying to protect themselves behind the scenes, and having illegally used the levers of power in doing so, they are playing a desperate game of doubling down and misdirection to throw off the hunt.  Think John Belushi trying to talk his way out of facing Carrie Fisher and her bazooka in ‚ÄúBlues Brothers‚Äù, on a grand scale.This goes to a recent idea that political positioning hardens up peoples‚Äô beliefs and commitments, and creates an environment of complete non-compromise and an unwillingness to entertain ideas or move one inch.  Trump, for his part, refuses to knuckle under to any of this, and they hate him for his ‚Äúunreasonableness‚Äù and ‚Äústubbornness‚Äù.  Is this all enough to take down an empire?  Stay tuned.

        To my mind the most significant feature of all this skulduggery is that members of the Deep State know dam‚Äô well there is almost zero chance they will be punished for their actions. They understand they are entirely above the law, which allows them free rein for their renegade actions. As Z himself noted in an earlier article, the system is incapable of reforming itself because it refuses to punish its own kind. Without some sort of purge of the Deep State, the Deep State will eventually topple a president and install one of its own. At that point, American democracy, for what it‚Äôs worth, will vanish.

        to me the silence they could enforce is the scariest part of the whole thing.  I am cynical enough to believe that only fear, deep fear of something truly horrible.

        ‚ÄúThe inner party now operates like a religious cult, rather than a political operation‚ÄùI think that is exactly where we are at.The elite wanna bees that our higher level education institutions are pumping out now are religious zealots with a hive mentality.We here on the dissident right and even the goofy libertarians are doomed if this keeps up.This Hive is gonna increasingly take on Soviet Union characteristics.We will find a way for creating a sane civilization again but what that way out is?It‚Äôs just not clear to me what that way out path is right now?Revolution by force is one answer but with the white boys we are raising in our civilization now by the AWFL‚Äôs.(American White Female Liberals)This will become more and more difficult with each passing year.And are there enough normal whites left to push back on any of our current nonsense?We are in a pickle.

                Agreed. This isn‚Äôt the Reds vs the Whites, an ethnic struggle between Balts, Jews, and Russians, strongly based in ideology.
This is shaping up to be a race war by people who have been conditioned to despise us. White genocide will start becoming literal, not just watching % on a graph go down. There are a decent number of us who will fight back. But let‚Äôs be honest, a significant chunk of whites will be gone before it even kicks off.

            Ron Unz‚Äôs theory of political success based on blackmail probably is also salient for the staying power of Rs like McCain and Lindsay Graham. Graham is a shill for the Lobby, which is part of it, but he also probably has that tag as a ‚Äúreasonable republican‚Äù because he has a few dead boys in his closet. One can also become a reasonable Republican by stabbing fellow party members in the back repeatedly (Romney has been absolved for the sin of running against Black Jesus since he tried to take down Trump).

            Uh, no. Recall the workout that happened around 1860. The Constitution lasted a few decades and we are living under some other organizing principle.
The Constitution was so profoundly flawed that half the states wanted to abandon it within a few decades of adoption and were only coerced to remain through an inconceivably violent conquest. That‚Äôs not a pretty good attempt by any definition.
The problem with the Constitution is‚Ä¶ the Constitution.

                Well, if Nazi is short for National Socialist, I have heard our system best described as Capital Socialism ‚Äì Cazi.  Not really sure if the government controls the corporations, vice-versa, or they are so intertwined you can hardly distinguish them.  The last being the most likely imho.
In this system, the government and large private corps work in tandem to rule, giving just enough social stability to the plebes to keep them under control, and either exterminating or bribing the more troublesome sectors of plebes.  It may not be the most brutal form of slavery, but it is soul crushing.

A lot of those plebs being crushed are capitalists:  small business owners or folks just trying to save for retirement.  The elites hoover up their money and jobs to redistribute them to a growing horde of brown filth in the pursuit of a borderless market where materialism and consumerism are the highest human values.  Gaze on Mexifornia and behold your Gazi-led dystopian future.

                    Has anyone ever worked in any organization whose number one goal wasn‚Äôt to keep itself going?Consider that government‚Äôs primary goal is to survive, by justifying its existence‚Ä¶ Unless it is restrained by some counterweight force (or a real budget), it will eventually send feelers into every single avenue of human endeavor. A short mask-free stroll to the park will bring this point home.Businesses prioritize their own welfare first. (Not saying they can‚Äòt be political, just that the first priority is staying in operation at all.) Now it is true there is wiggle room in how business and govt interact, to maintain an equilibrium that 1) ensures their mutual survival and 2) mutual back scratching.But if it‚Äôs going to survive, a business has to develop defenses, meaning hiring a workforce to deal with governmental intrusions (HR dept is just the bare minimum), providing they have the margins to finance such defenses.Every year, these defensive costs only increase ‚Äî they NEVER decrease. (Until Trump, that is, a little.)As Fed govt continues to bloat and deficit spending now has no limit, businesses (especially big fish like tech, defense, telecommunications) can tap into huge govt contracts. Defense contracting became an obscene feeding frenzy under Reagan. Today, a diversity statement is probably required to take up half of a request for proposal, to even be considered.Much of what we see as offensive political behavior is done to minimize risk of governmental prosecution. Take those obnoxious diversity ads from banks and insurance companies for example. Purely defensive posturing, ‚ÄúWe are complying and we love complying ‚Äì see? can‚Äôt touch us‚Äù. Like a protection racket man≈ìuvre. Being sued by the DOJ civil rights division is a very, very expensive proposition to be avoided by any and all means. The adverts they run are in Lieu of insurance policies against govt prosecution!The whole ecosystem of Congress/aides, lobbyists, think tanks, interest groups could best have the air taken out of it by starving Congressional ‚Äúspending‚Äù. (Alternatively, the $ could collapse.) Spending pumps the rot to grotesque proportions ‚Äì across all of our institutions.If you run your own business, you won‚Äôt find it soul crushing. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that Hillary and crew wants to eliminate ALL contract work ‚Äì it‚Äôs an individual‚Äôs best route to avoid being made into a corporate zombie. (Plus, she wants all contractors unionized). In CA, you can no longer legally hire the neighborhood semi-homeless Guy to clean or do janitorial services for example. CA may go belly up any day and there is no other way to exert any brakes on its insane state house, so let it rip! Illinois too.

Of course it worked great for y‚Äôall. You won the great war, did you not? You got to pillage the enemy and impose your will on him, rejoicing in the lamentations of their women or whatever, and run the country as you saw fit. What, exactly, is not to like?
Anyhow, I don‚Äôt have too much tolerance these days for folks on the right who think everything was great until {Clinton, Obama, LBJ, Carter}. It was, as experiments go, a complete failure almost immediately.

                        BTP-On a personal level, My ancestors had no dog in the fight and my ancestral home state of California was the most pro-Southern of all non-Southern states during the lead-up to the war.My sympathies are very much with the South, but the whole notion that ‚Äúthe Constitution died in 1865‚Äù pre-supposes that the Constitution assumes a Union of Sovereign States which can be walked away from.  This was clearly NOT the majority position very early in the Republic‚Äôs life.  Indeed, if Southerners were so upset at Andrew Jackson over the Nullification Crisis (as good a test for the ‚ÄòUnion of Sovereign States‚Äô as there ever was), why did Old Hickory carry everything Southern State save SC in his re-election two years later.In short:-A Union of Sovereign States would have been more just than a perpetual marriage-The former never existed, except as a cope for the likes of John C Calhoun.The Constitution didn‚Äôt die in 1865.  If you were outside the war zone, you barely noticed.

Its very clear clear that for 1/3 of States it did not and when they tried to leave, they weren‚Äôt allowed.
That speaks against the entire document. A binding national document must work for basically an entire nation.
If the DR gets power, it will need a new 20xx suitable Constitution filled with lawyer resistant verbiage and clear stated intent with penalties for bad rulings.
If they can‚Äôt get that, they‚Äôll be better off with less land and a homogeneous political system  and not repeating the mistakes of the last bunch.

                    Article V is not a roll,of the dice.  Same ratification rules as for an Amendment proposed and passed by Congress are in place.  It simply places the initiation for such Amendments at a level closer to the States‚Äô electorate.

                That was a sad episode among many sad episodes that marked the steady erosion of a fairly free country. The fact that you can write that in a public forum and it would not be permitted to about half of the people alive today and probably 99% of the people who ever lived shows how much capital we had accumulated.  You take it for granted and complain it was not perfect.Where was better? Athens in 500 BC ? Early Rome Republic? The United Kingdom in the 19th Century? New Zealand today?  A slim fraction of history ‚Äì maybe 1/10,000 and none without flaws. Nothing else even approaches. We were the golden age of mankind. Until the next great step forward for individual freedom.

        I think a lot of this behavior is based on a couple interrelated factors. Foremost in their intransigence is the rock solid belief that the Bad Orange Man and his Dirt People populism is only temporary. Their long term prospects as elites or ambitious wannabe elites depends on them closing ranks. That‚Äôs the motivation behind every single careerist in the ruling class. As far as I can see, that‚Äôs a safe bet because there‚Äôs nothing beyond Trump himself. There‚Äôs no future for the conservative bugman in supporting a temporary aberration in politics as usual, and there‚Äôs certainly none for the progressive bugman/woman/thing in selling out globohomo when globohomo is likely to regain the Imperial Capital sooner or later.

        Excellent synopsis.‚ÄúA much more serious problem is a government overrun by fanatical ideologues.‚ÄùAnd a problem even more serious than ideologues are the sociopaths.  It‚Äôs the rampant sociopathy that makes these conspiracies so difficult to unravel, because we common folk can‚Äôt fathom the logic.  Sociopaths are out to destroy enemies ‚Äì that‚Äôs it, period.  They thrive on creating chaos, and when they get into power they thrive on destroying pillars of civilization.I‚Äôve had my experiences with sociopaths ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre very simply diabolical.  I‚Äôm persuaded  the only way to defeat the sociopath is with the noose.  Threat of the noose isn‚Äôt good enough.

        I believe we are past the point where any of this really matters.  Regardless of whether any heads roll as a result of this, nothing will change.  The cloud people truly hate us and will not stop until we are dead or completely beaten down into submission.The only solution is to physically separate yourself from these vermin.  That means moving to an area where these prissy little faggotts would never venture.  There are still plenty of these areas in this country.You probably won‚Äôt get rich, but you can get by and you won‚Äôt be affected by any of this nonsense.

        I doubt loyalty or zeal are enough to preserve the lie as such. Rather, I think fear of what the so-called deep state can do to a rat is what is keeping people in line.

        Once again, our most powerful gov‚Äôt institutions are revealed to be utterly and unabashedly corrupt, and once again, not a single consequence aside from maybe a token firing will befall them. The only possible way reform is going to happen is if enough people end up angry enough with too little left to lose to be fearful anymore. Neither team of cloud people gives one iota of a shit about us little folks. There is no hope for interior reform for an aristocracy this rotten.

        It may be ‚Äúreligious‚Äù fanatacism, as Zman posits.  I agree that it‚Äôs not lust or greed, those historical drivers of corruption.  The Epstein/Pizzagate/Spirit Cooking angle is a distraction precisely because perversion titillates the masses.  But an equally plausible explanation for the corruption is simple stupidity.  Obama‚Äôs circle of advisors was filled with joggers and jogger-worshipping types.  Apply Hanlon‚Äôs Razor:  not malice but stupidity.  There is no Magic Jogger.  Obama and his minions were a ship of fools who mistakenly thought they were clever.  Time and the document trail has proven otherwise.

            The tasks for Obama and his minions.1. Get Obama elected2. Help selves to mega-Ukraine foreign aid kickback bucks3. Spy on and blow up any threats to the sweet deal4. Get Hillary elected to protect the sweet deal5. Skip town and enjoy the new richesThey blew #4, and Trump threatened to blow the lid on #2 and the efforts against him on #3.  So they doubled down on #3, and used Ukraine as part of it, to try to immunize themselves from any investigation of Ukraine, by claiming that looking at Ukraine is retaliation.So the only question now is whether Trump and his people are for real, both in desire and in capability, in blowing the cover off of all of it?  If that is so, than the Obama crew is really dumb.  They should have simply skipped #3, and they certainly shouldn‚Äôt have doubled down on it.  But as Mike said to Saul Goodman, ‚ÄúWe all make choices, and those choices, they put us on a road. And sometimes those choices seem small, but they put you on a bad road.  You think about getting off, but eventually you are back on it.‚Äù

            I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fear. The state has demonstrated numerous times that it can and will kill to pretect itself without consequences to itself, and, that it will also take care of it‚Äôs own. So you work and depend upon an entity that is entirely predictable and quite benevolent. Fear is only for someone who  actually becomes a traitor to their way of life. Flynn did not share their ways but he also did not properly fear them.

        Yet another great post Z.I fear that there is another power behind the ones that have been talked about here today. A power bigger and stronger than we have imagined. I don‚Äôt pretend to know what it is and I don‚Äôt have my tin foil hat with me today.  I just fear there are people with deep, deep pockets pulling the strings from way, way behind the throne.I pray I am wrong and just having a bad day, but everywhere I look and read today there is nothing but really bad news ‚Äî almost as if a master plan had been put into action.

        Don‚Äôt ignore that Flynn at DIA shook the IC communities branches, thereby Flynn had IC enemies galore.  Not all of them as weak as Evan McMuffin.There is a Deep State, they bought down Nixon (Woodward was and is Deep State, cub reporter a fairy tale ‚Äì nuclear cleared, WHICA officer, Offered Harvard Law scholarship but turned it down for cub reporter ü§£) the Deep State exists and bought down Nixon ‚Äì but failed with Trump.    Flynn made enemies in the IC and was an actual maverick- and they wanted him away from power.   Intrinsically.  Trump needed to have people like Flynn and Sessions gone or in checkmate; Trump needed to be in the situation where he was blind.  And alone except for family.He improved his situation with Giuliani and Pompeo, but not so much with Barr.  Somewhat with Barr ‚Äì he knows too much to be pushed aside and punked out like Sessions.Agree with Z that politics is power.The IC however has its own power to protect ‚Äì and did.

            Woodward was a NROTC scholarship student at Yale, Class of ‚Äô65, which is what took him to DC after college, posted to the Pentagon, I think; interestingly he also was the Business Manager for a campus publication called the Yale Banner (I can‚Äôt put my hands on it just now) which freshman could purchase to learn about the wonders of the university they were now a part of, exciting things such as the Lit(erary Society), secret societies, JV crew and singing groups.  The Whiffs, anybody?  So Woodward was learning the ropes of how to make money in publishing long before anyone heard of Watergate, or thought much of the Washington Post or his own endless string of ‚Äúnon-fiction‚Äù tomes.  He was from Elgin IL ‚Äî pretty sure a public high school, too.  So he was on the make, for sure, gonna show those preppies a thing or two.

        It‚Äôs the universities.  You have a government of people who have matriculated from American universities designed to create a maoist like conformity across the upper and upper-middle classes.  That sameness is uniquely exhibited by the Obamas and the whites that like them.  You‚Äôre not running to the media because you‚Äôre defending your class, status and position.  Plenty of people make more money than them, have bigger and better houses, and better lives, but they have no insider status, therefore they‚Äôre just seen as garish rich people.  It‚Äôs a certain follower type, raised in sheltered households.  The kind you would see at the tail end of any regime.  Losers who don‚Äôt know it.

        There is no incentive to go to the media, none of them would report it. Anyway just as as with the mafia a willingness to murder a few snitches or a seeming willingness to do so would tend to keep people quiet. After Seth Rich was killed the message got out and Epstein was a nice reinforcement.The funny thin is is even if these weren‚Äôt anything but what the narrative says they are, it doesn‚Äôt matter. The effect is the same.  Snitches get stitches.Given the the US was formed by a conspiracy so given the right circumstances, a wide ranging conspiracy is perfectly possible.Hell Ben Franklin was in the Hellfire Club  and most Founders were Freemasons  no reason a modern version of Thelema or any other secret society wouldn‚Äôt attract high ranking people.For example, Nxivm is public record and had influential , wealthy and powerful members. A smarter run cult.secret society/ The Skulls kind of thing is perfectly possible.Now I‚Äôm still in ‚Äúits probably a psy-op‚Äù category myself but events suggest there  could  be  some truth to the Q Anon stuff.

        It may be simpler.  They think they are more Teflon than Hillary who was caught, and nothing happened.  Also see the Pakastani IT scandal which WAS forgotten.  Crowdstrike probably assumes they will never be held accountable.
A second problem is who do they go to?  CNN?  Even Faux News covers things up more than exposes them.  I wonder how many of Dan Bongino‚Äôs sources are in the loop.  Maybe QAnon?

        ‚ÄúWhy are all of these people risking their freedom to maintain an obvious lie? ‚ÄùThat‚Äôs the key question.

The farce of American democracy and the reality of the American Police State never has been more on display. If any of the key players ever were indicted and faced serious time, that person could bring down the who clown show. So maintaining the obvious lie is a low risk venture.‚ÄúMaybe the Seth Rich assassination looms larger than anyone realizes.Although, again, the D.C. junta will face no consequences when it emerges that either an FBI or IC cut-out murdered Seth Rich, it will prove deeply embarrassing, and of greater concern, further discredit the fraud that is ‚Äúour‚Äù representative government. There may be some movement on this front, too, as reportedly there have been documents unearthed that show the Rich assassination apparently was a topic of concern among the junta.

        I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily discount money as a motivation. Uncontrolled access to a stream of our country‚Äôs most secret HUMINT and SIGINT could enable a dishonest person or organization to amass truly immense amounts of wealth, far more than enough to bribe any public servant or have them whacked if they cause trouble. Perhaps what we have here is the world‚Äôs richest and most brutal Mafia gang pretending to be a political party.

        The entire process is too adamant to be just about sex, money or even power. That leaves ideology. But, it‚Äôs hard to believe any group could be so ideologically pure. They all seem too craven for that. Maybe we need to be looking for an Adam Sutler or a Ming the Merciless.

            Virus in your link, Rezlac.
It popped up when I got to the part that al-Thani of Qatar funds 99% of Saudi dissidents in the US.
This is tl;dr, a deposition in the court of Toronto. Please give the summary, as I have no idea what connection Qatari fixers have to do with today‚Äôs article.
(I‚Äôm personally shocked that the seed of Abraham (Ishmael) would employ dawa (culture war), spies, and infiltrators.)

        I like the line in Crane Brinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnatomy of Revolution.‚Äù  All revolutions produce disappointing results. So the marchers through the institutions keep amping it up. Because there must be justice at the end of the arc of history.
And that is the state of our liberal friends. They cannot believe that their foolish cult is failing on all fronts. There must be a fault in there somewhere. There must be a conspiracy for a dope like Trump to get elected. Redouble your efforts, comrades!

        Grand jury testimony was released? Unredacted??? I thought these things were always, always kept secret. One more cherished illusion of the justice system shattered. I‚Äôll keep that in mind in the admittedly unlikely event I ever serve on a grand jury.
