        It seems like the early Church had similar problems, particularly with Gnostics and other sketchy entryists. “Hello, fellow Christians! Shall we hang out and discuss the demiurge?”That particular problem was mostly solved by guys like Irenaeus showing up and suppressing them, by fiat mostly, and burning their books. But he had authority by virtue of being made a bishop by others who were made bishops by men who were directly appointed by Jesus and who suffered martyrdom. That’s a pretty good basis for authority if you are a Christian in the second century.But NEOTR doesn’t have any source of legitimacy except argument. Someone like Z might convince me to, say, reject Shapiro as not one of us but to accept Matt Walsh as on our team. But maybe he doesn’t convince others. What then?I think the fact is a leader must do the needful and that his preferences become legitimate by virtue of that fact. Much as I hate to think it, Trump – who is catastrophically bad on so many things – is running unopposed.Yeah, things are that bad.

            There was a very wide range of Christian organizations and beliefs.  The bishops brand was not the largest nor the earliest of those.
The earliest church was James’ , supposedly  a brother of Jesus, based in Jerusalem.  It got stamped out, too Jewish.
Marcionites were the largest sect and published the first new testament.  But they rejected the old testament god as evil, and thus it could not be Jesus’ father because Jesus was good. It got stamped out, not Jewish enough.
Perhaps the baby bear bishops just had power of the sword.

                “There was a very wide range of Christian organizations and beliefs. ”
That’s like saying there was a very wide range of vegetarians, those that ate meat, those that ate fish, those that ate vegetables.
Nope, no there are vegetarians and other people who wanted vegetarians to be something other than vegetarians.
Christians knew what Christianity meant and were quite clear about who the fakes were from the earliest times.
“Marcionites were the largest sect and published the first new testament.”
Some kind of record here for publishing the oldest fake news ever.

            Yes, as I said in a comment earlier in the week, the whole posturing is pretty LARPy. The fact that these guys actually think they are part of some movement that has grown significant to the point that it now requires intensive efforts at consolidation, is a beta-move. It’s backing into a proposition by “assuming the sale,” like the guy who never has a girlfriend making comments about crazy women are when he’s shooting the breeze with the other guys, as if he were some kind of seasoned woodsman. Both the strategy and the perceived need to employ it is something the Dissident Right picked up from their long association with the PUA charlatans, who are second only to the HBD charlatans in the amount of damage they have done to the Right. It’s annoying enough when actual cads talk this way, but it’s eyerollingly bad when wannabe cads do it.Furthermore, as I said in my comment earlier in this thread (which was of course completely misunderstood by everybody), most of these guys are angling for policies that they believe will improve their lotwithin the context of the contemporary socioeconomic consensus.Thus, they are not particularly revolutionary in substance. This kind of thing is called “lobbying.” There’s nothing wrong with that, but it isn’t really as far outside the mainstream as they like to pretend that it is. If this is the kind of stuff the Dissident Right cares about, then they should just form a lobbying 501(c) and have at it. They would probably get a lot more exposure that way.

                ID, your major disagreement with Z Man and the commentariat seems to be that you believe that the economic structure of society is more influential than race.  Please elucidate.
To get you started, why do economically successful blacks still vote for Democrat “socialism,” as opposed to voting Republican or libertarian?  If economic status is more important than race, wouldn’t you expect to see the rich blacks backing candidates that prioritized low taxes?

                    Hello LineInThe Sand,If you go back to the original comment, what I said was thatrace relationsare downstream from economics. Race relations, not race. Please pay attention to the words I actually used.What this means is that, in ordinary private life, if you want to part ways with someone who isn’t fulfilling your requirements—an employee or a business partner, perhaps—you generally just do that. Or, even if you are unable to do that for practical reasons, you can at least make it a policy and a desideratum for the future to find a different route, and you can work towards that goal by taking concrete steps. One thing you definitely would not do is spend years—decades!—writing long, tendentious diatribes attempting to prove that your business partners have a lower average IQ than you do, or exhibit a higher frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms loosely associated with high time preference.If there was anything useful you could do about your situation, you would do it—and then the HBD-inspired pilpul would be rightly seen for the idiotic waste of time that it is. So why does the Dissident Right expend all its energy on pointless essaying instead of useful action? It’s because it feels helpless against the enforced social conformity that demands racial integration. Very well then, with what power is this social conformity enforced? Predominantly with economic power, namely the ability to economically ruin dissidents through deplatforming and cancellation, career disruption and the like. So why are these threats such a deterrence?  Because modern socioeconomic conditions reduce the vast majority of men to the condition of wage slavery and prevent them from acquiring independent means of support. Therefore, it stands to reason that if you want to avoid enforced conformity, you will need economic independence and attachment to productive property that is not wholly dependent on the whims of the state.When the liberty to self-associate is assured, then race, be whatsoever it may, is not a problem. But that liberty is simply not possible without independent means. The modern state will not grant it to you as a free gift. Therefore, the only truly pragmatic, useful, and effective path for dissident politics to take is to weaken the oligarchic control of society and rule of the modern optimates.

                        “When the liberty to self-associate is assured”
Only a subset of white men places a high value on liberty.  Almost no one else does and all attempts throughout history to persuade them to value liberty have failed.  That’s just life as we find it.
For example, blacks may say that they want the liberty to self-associate, but their actions demonstrate that they place a higher value on forcing themselves on white society to reap the benefits of welfare.
You can’t force non-whites to place a high value on liberty because they just don’t, generally speaking.  It’s not in their natures.

        How goes your DAY OF JIHAD, fellas?I went to my neighborhood Arab liquor store, looking like what every Arab I ever met recognizes as a crypto Jew, and the guy didn’t have the right change (increasingly common sign of society failing) so he knocked a few cents off my bill to make it work.On my way there and back I was listening to Red Scare—shitlib podcast, but they’re not afraid of “right-coded” true things—and they were talking about the German/”German” girl who was the martyr-symbol of day one of our current thing.Has anyone noted (the ladies did not) that that woman had flown almost a third of the way around the world to attend a drugs &amp; sodomy festival staged at the border of the most seriously Islamic region/state/population in the world—DRESSED LIKE AN AMERICAN? It was a Great Satan costume party!Conservatives (especially) talk about her like she’s a naive peace-loving child idiot. Not at all, and not only because she’s a “hag.” What she did is far more sadistic than what was done to her, because she did it thinking she had “the world” on her side.Oops.

        Col. Macgregor gave an interview I watched today.  He reported that after Israel issued the order that the one million Palestinians in North Gaza must move to South Gaza,  Egypt began to organize an aid convoy to assist the displaced.    Israel, in typical fashion, has threatened to attack the humanitarian aid convoy if one arrives at Gaza.    That is not a good look Israel.   Al Sisi has always tried to maintain good relations with Israel.
I have no use for Hamas terrorists and no use for Israel as well.   Color me anti-semetic if you will.

        Jamie Dimon says you can now officially be alarmed;“ This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement that accompanied the bank’s earnings news release.”Now.  Here’s all I want out of this, the opportunity, and for America (and so the West) :Israel raises the Black Flag and does it.This then releases Americans* to do the same.I don’t care about the Middle East, or Israel.I care  about America saving itself from her enemies and I don’t mean Islam.If the Western World’s opinion makers Team wage war without mercy- as they should- the rest of us are released.*Especially The American white right wingers who place their patriotism with Israel, as they aren’t allowed to do with America.  Ignore their imperfections if they act.Inverse scenario;  if Israel flinches it collapses, the psychological shock to the West will be very severe, more than the fall of France in 1940, and the Defenders will lose heart and desert.All over the West.Now people here only think they want collapse because they’ve never seen it, moreover they delude themselves they’ll survive then build on the ruins.  Both survival and rebuilding are delusion.If you mean survive like the pretty Israeli girl survives HAMAS passed around well… yes.If you think you’ll rebuild- you’ll be corpses.So delusion.To survive you fight, and this is our best chance, the break we’ve been waiting for… so take it.Or die cursing yourself.

                That’s because the Left is in power now. Remember how they protested Reagan’s deployment of missiles in Europe against the USSR? Today they’re fighting a proxy war against Russia and they want Ukraine to join NATO, meaning U.S. troops and the U.S. nuclear umbrella defending it. Insane.
The Left is only against war when a Republican is in the White House.

        The inability to keep out the crazies was baked in to the alt right.  Its chief enthusiasts were convinced they had found some fresh magic that could neutralize the Left, and for a little while they had some success.  There was a great hatred of “gatekeepers”, and that made them all the more zealous for allowing the “Come one, come all” approach.  It’s as if they were relying upon Adam Smith’s old “Invisible Hand” to somehow keep everything from running off the rails.There was another feature of the alt right: the supposed absence of any central figure or leader.  This was thought to be a sure way of short-circuiting the Left’s Alinskyite tactic of picking a target, isolating and then destroying it.  This couldn’t work if the alt right remained an amorphous, leaderless force, but the absence of a leader meant no one was in charge, and no one had the authority to decide who was in and who was out.

            There WAS a leader, self appointed bellamy throwing weaselwaffen homofuhrer Richard Spencer.He of course immediately did the stupidest possible things to marginalize the movement to the undecided by sympathetic.  I used to think he was a fully paid up intentional bad actor like Andrew Anglin but now I’m pretty sure he’s just a fool with dreams of being Paris Hilton.Having no leader might have been okay but it opened the possibility of having leader appointed for you be the (((media))) and they sure had some ideal candidates.The right wing thing seems to be doing well since all that and no leader seems to be working well in terms of picking up intellectual steam even if literally no one has any action plan with a timeline measurable in decades rather than centuries.

                Maybe there’s no action plan possible.Maybe our dechristianisation doomed us all(and considering 90% of Christians use a fake Holy Scripture*, fasifield by Masoretic pharisians rabbis, the situation is even worse)*both catholic’s Vulgate and, of course, every protestant bible is falsified.That afternoon, I had fun comparing, verse by verse, Genesis from LXX (aka Bible of Alexandria aka Septuagint) with the common “Bible of Jerusalem”. The results were scary : near EVERY VERSE get falsified in deep sense. I guess that’s the same with the KJV, the Scofield or the eucumenic modern version (I can’t even imagine how awful should be that last one🤣).But you know what? That don’t scare me very much. Because I have faith in God/Jesus/HS, and no trick from anyone will prevail.(but I wonder, that said, if this calm faith isn’t a path threw inaction. The truth is I have absolutely no clue of what we can do, outside convince people to find the truth. But it’s already neat impossible to make people chznge their mind on politics, so on religious things, that’s even harder.Yep. No way we get out of the situation. But we still have possibilities of take care of our own lives and of people we love, and… See the buffoony frow amused spectator POV. Something like that)

                    Do you not know who Andrew Anglin is and what he and his boss (((weev))) were up to for the past decade or so?Not the new “hello fellow reasonable dissident thinkers” thing he’s doing now but the old time fax swastikas to random numbers, pro rape proud incel, hollywood cartoon nazi, miraculously avoid prosecution and lawsuits thing?  The whole era where stormfront was essentially a synonym for retard containment on the internet at large.He’s only ever been a bad actor about as obvious and intentionally counterproductive as atomwaffen.  If you havent been in this sphere very long and you’ve only seen his most recent rebrand then I can see your confusion.For all his faults even Nick Fuentes at his worst has been approximately a million times more serious and less of an optic disaster than Anglin.

        Zman, the gist of what you wrote demonstrates clearly the limitations and ultimately uselessness of the term ‘right.’  No enemies to the right in what?  Politics?  Culture?  Foreign affairs?  You note that the way it’s used by Haywood means maintaining focus on the main quest and not getting distracted by side issues.  But what is the main quest, if one is using only the generic term “right”?I am generally anti-abortion and pro-Christian, but I immediately part ways with someone who makes those issues his main focus and claims imaginary ‘brotherhood’ with a Nigerian Christian instead of a White agnostic.  IMHO, it all boils down to the question Citizen of a Silly Country likes to pose to wafflers and civnats:  “Who are your people?”That is why I either half jokingly refer to myself as a fascist, or accurately and specifically as an ethno-nationalist.  I believe in different countries for different people.  And while I would ultimately prefer to ‘live and let live’ in a world of different yet homogeneous nations, my primary concern – my “main focus” – is the existence and well being of White people.  No personal animus towards any Thais or Bolivians necessary or intended, but they are not my people and not my concern, and I would willingly jettison them all to preserve White, European western people and civilization.

            The brotherhood is not imaginary, but neither is it biological; it is spiritual.  Thus, it can transcend space.  Thus, my Nigerian Christian brother can be my spiritual brother in Nigeria.“preserve White, European western people and civilization.”I am all for that.  Of course to preserve it, you need to identify it. The problem, imho, nationalism doesn’t really scale up.  You can say a Scot and a Welsh are “White brothers”, what about the Scot and the German?  Maybe still.  The Italian and the German?  Maybe the Northern Italian.  Maybe you could say generically Europeans, but you start to see the problem.  Toss in the 100+ million Whites you have in the US, and you really begin to see the problem.  Not to mention the whole f*cked up geography thing.  Is the German descendant living in Bolivia closer to the Finn from Minnesota than the Irish guy in Boston?  Breakup into smaller units with mutual defense pacts seems the best shot solution, not unlike the Germanic and Celtic tribes of old.  I don’t know, it’s a mess.

                c matt:  Valid points.  I am not –  contra some on the White right – advocating for one giant White nation.  As you note, even the mixing of European Whites in AINO has created conflict and confusion.  Let people self sort and self govern, certainly.  But there have to be some general rules and guidelines.  Plenty of people with 35% indigenous blood in Brazil call themselves White.  John Derbyshire considers his hapa children ‘white.’  And many White Christians would willingly celebrate the earthly marriage of their White daughter to your ‘spiritual’ Nigerian brother.  Thus my main point still stands.

                    I’m not advocating for a “giant” white homeland either, simply because it isn’t even remotely feasible at this point. I do, however, support the creation of a smaller white homeland, perhaps the equivalent of one fifth of AINO’s lower 48.
As for Derb and his like, they can claim all they want, but that doesn’t make it so. Nobody who is 1/3 non-white is white, IMO. Hell, I’m not sure I’d even count somebody who is 1/4 PoC as white, although I’d grant that that is a matter for debate.

                A Finn and an Afrikaaner are far, far more alike than an Afrikaaner and a Zulu or even a Jew. Yes, there is some diversity in whitness, but nowhere near as much variation as there is between any specific instantiation of whitness and any Other.

                    This is genomically true. Everyone has two copies of each gene b/c 2 chromosomes. Genes have different versions called alleles. If you look at genomes from all the ethnicities from all the races in the human species, you will see that white (European) people have the greatest propensity to have different alleles for genes, and the rest of humanity has occurrences of same allele at MUCH higher rates.Essentially, this is a measure of inbreeding. It is an historical record of just how spoiled the women of white ethnicities have been for THOUSANDS OF YEARS relative to the women of every other ethnic group from the other races.It’s kind of like:-white girl: “Daddy, I want to get married to Tom who I met at the bakery.”-white girl’s Dad: “Hmm, he an apprentice in the Baker’s Guild and hence has a future. OK.”-brown girl: “Daddy, I want to get married to Achmed who I met at the bakery.”-brown girl’s Dad: “Absolutely not. You can choose between your 1rst cousin or your 2 2nd cousins who are all of marriageable age. If I hear any backtalk, I’ll start considering your other much older 1rst cousin who is recently a widower.”Rinse and repeat over thousands of years and alleles accumulate ‘in the family’. Inbreeding is not a biological function problem IF AND ONLY IF all your alleles are good, but they never are. No one has perfect genes: new mutations get added every generation. The incredible advantage of being able to shed bad alleles (Punnett Square) is why sexual reproduction evolved.

            “claims imaginary ‘brotherhood’ with a Nigerian Christian instead of a White agnostic”White agnostics are prominent among the ones that moved Nigerian Christians a couple houses down.  Now instead of wishing each other well and acknowledging our brotherhood in Christ and perhaps helping one another independently and at a comfortable remove…  we are both pretty miserable.  This was not the model of historical Christianity which was quite comfortable with nations, different peoples, and strong borders.  (((Internationalists))) and the culture that they helped dechristianize in their own image brought all these horrors to all of us.White atheists are their useful idiots as is obvious enough if you consult voting patterns and cross reference religious identification.  Actual church going self identified christians would have a wall and deportations if their voting preferences meant anything.  Secular right wingers are pretty much a nonexistent constituency outside of a vocal fringe presence online in forums that are already extremely fringe.While race is important and it is very salient to us now in the violent airport lounge on america it is not the only division that matters.  Atheist swedes that want your son wearing a dress and getting buggered arent my people either.  Theyre a natural deal end that literally cannot even reproduce if they arent grooming other people’s children.Atheist rationalism opened the door to (((malign influence))) and its no coincidence that your average blue hair ethical nonmonagamous body positive woman hates christians.

                I’m not sure how to put this in a way that doesn’t sound arrogant, but atheism and agnosticism don’t work for IQs at midwit or lower.Not getting into whether or not God exists given that can’t be proved anyways and anyone who says they can prove it is an idiot, but religion provides an effective set of heuristics for their adherents who aren’t likely to be pondering any deep philosophical questions.  Take that away and you leave dumb people grasping for someone to tell them right vs wrong, sometimes cults but more often the government steps in and declares itself the new and improved God.  So dumb atheists are overwhelmingly leftist since the government tells them how smart they are for having abortions and washing black people’s feet.

Don’t need that sort of thing myself but it’s a bit much to say that this is something “idiots” do.There are smart and dull atheists and smart and dull Christians, no one has a monopoly there.  One shudders to imagine but there are even lots of smart liberals.  Intelligence while useful for certain things is an unearned accident of birth like having green eyes.

                    I suppose I should clarify that I’m not saying smart people can or can’t be religious.  I suspect that religion doesn’t make much difference for smart people because they can rationalize, all the high IQ Christians I’ve known invariably find excuses to ignore the parts they don’t like.My point was that dumb people can’t think for themselves so they need moral rules laid down for them.  A religious authority tends to work better or at least be more stable since changing the rules costs a lot of legitimacy given it’s supposed to be the 2600 year old unchanging word of God.  The current year scenario we have is secular dummies and midwits taking their morality from the psychopaths in the government, much the same as under communism.

        Trying to apply the ‘no enemies to the left’ philosophy to the right wing is to make a fundamental mistake in assessing the problems faced by the modern right.  If we had the privilege of controlling public morality and the press, the left would quickly adopt a policy of attacking their own side when our press makes them look bad by our moral standards.   Allowing the left to define “racism” as the ultimate moral evil and their press reporting on the “bad guys” dressed in funny uniforms necessitates our side trying to police the worst actors purporting to be on our side.We ignore this state of affairs to our peril.  “No enemies on the right” is allowing our enemies to define us.

            As long as our enemies control all instruments of knowledge and information, they will define us to their advantage. Attempting to refute or nullify that definition is a big mistake insofar as it’s an exercise in futility. We must do as we please, and to hell with those who villify us.

                So, in other words, let them continue to define what is both good and evil and also us?
IMHO, this is a mistake. What this problem says to me is we need more influence over culture. It shows we are largely fighting the wrong (and unwinnable) battle.  If they get to define White interests as “RACIST,” and racism as the ultimate evil, what does winning politically accomplish?
You cannot play a game when having to abide by the rules the other side gets to make and change at their leisure.

                    I’m afraid the Left has a near monopoly over the culture, and they’re not about to cede one iota of it to us. We must accept that they will label us as they please, and hope that normal whites can see through the idiocy of the labels. Eventually, when AINO collapses, we will be in a strong position to determine what comes next.

        Who’s on the right?
I think the following three criteria are fair: to be a sincere member of the dissident right, you need to be A) Biorealist(for both race and sex), B)Anti-Immigration(including legal immigration), and C) Nondemocratic(rather than anti-democratic). Anyone who satisfies all three is probably okay.
Shapiro himself is pro-immigration so he’s an enemy, if occasionally a useful one.

                Ben Shapiro “talks fast” because he perceives time more slowly than the rest of us. Like other microfauna such as the hummingbird or squirrel, his rapidity is just normal speed for him, and to Shapiro we average-sized humans appear to be moving in slow motion.

            Ben Shapiro is manufactured, controlled opposition. He functions as a gatekeeper, or bookend, of right-wing thought. Your right wing thoughts stop here. Any farther to the right and you are literally Hittller.Matt Walsh showed his true colors and lost all credibility with his take on the South Carolina jogger case. Sure, Matt, it’s perfectly normal to go on a run in a strange neighborhood ten miles from home carrying a hammer, then take a detour to check out the construction of an empty house. Who hasn’t done that at least once or twice in their lifetime? He has been pushing hard on the trans issue in an attempt to regain his credibility on the right precisely because the trans issue is a safe zone. Don’t fall it.

        The whole idea of “No enemies on the Right” is an obvious attempt to put a hedge around what would otherwise be a very factious situation. If those on the Right all openly declared what they are for rather than just what they are against, they would have to part company with each other. In fact, I’m not even sure that this mythical entity called “the Right” even really exists.I would not consider myself a compatriot of any of the personalities I’m familiar with who call themselves “the Right,” or who are called that by others. I think first and foremost, a man of the Right must be a God-fearing man and a perennialist. He must let the Eternal Word inform his responses to the pressures of the present moment. Instead, what we see on the so-called Right today are people who are upset with the current situation and want to improve things for themselves in certain ways, and who therefore incidentally oppose themselves to certain aspects of “the Left,” but who aren’t guided by anything higher than their own natural self-seeking. This is why they don’t put forth any coherent philosophy or political program.In the day and age we live in, the dominant power in the world is abstract money, finance capital and the oligarchies that control it. The competence of the contemporary philosopher is measured by how well he understands that the battle isprecisely here, and not in the so-called social problems. That is why the DR obsession with race is such a fruitless endeavor. Even if you believe that personal behavior is always downstream from race, that misses the essential point thatrace relations are downstream from economics.There is no particular problem posed by race that would not be solved by resolving the overarching issue of economics in the modern world, and no satisfactory solution to the race problem can be got without resolving economics.Until I see “the Right” come to an awareness of this, it is not possible to take it very seriously.

            ID writes that people “on the so-called Right” “want to improve things for themselves” but cannot “put forth any coherent philosophy or political program.”White nationalism has a coherent explanation of our situation and requires individual sacrifice for our group.  You can say that WN will never succeed, but it is neither incoherent nor selfish.(Truthfully, in my case, there was an element of “saving your own skin.”  I only embraced WN after I realized that most people on the planet are most loyal to their race and that I must respond to that reality.  While I could be a race-blind civic nationalist, most non-whites could not, even if they wanted to.)

            I disagree entirely.To begin, you blithely elide the distinction between enlightened and naked self interest. All human beings, even those who claim to be God-fearing men are, of course, primarily motivated by self interest. Those on the Right are no more or less so than anybody else. However, speaking for myself, my self interest is embedded in the interest of my people, i.e. the white race, Caucasians, Europeans, et al. Yes, my self interest is prime, but it at least redounds to the benefit of a much larger group of people. This is enlightened self interest.In contrast are those whose self interest is naked. Such people tend toward sociopathy. They monomaniacally pursue their own gratification without regard to the broken bodies strewn along the byways. Politicians in democracies, almost without exception, fall into this loathesome category. The poster boy would be none other than Bill Clinton.As for your argument that economics rather than race is prime, it is Marxian claptrap. With certain provisos and caveats germaine to individual situations, people who desire wealth and are capable of acquiring it lawfully, do so. Those who are incapable or for whom material wealth is secondary or even inconsequential, do not.And, as is clear for all with eyes to see, certain peoples have a higher percentage of capable constituents than others. (Whether acquisitiveness is evenly distributed among peoples is less clear, although I think not.) What this means is that different races functioning in a more-or-less unconstrained environment, will have wildly divergent material outcomes. Negroes, probably the most incapable people on the planet, will languish, while Ashkenazim and eastern Orientals, will flourish. Whites will slot in directly behind those latter two groups.But really, economic focus misses the broader and more important point, which is that, so long as people are tolerably comfortable from a material standpoint, a sympathetic cultural environment is the chief determinant of happiness. Hence, most people would rather earn 50K per annum dwelling among people who share their culture than 100K per annum and live in a hostile cultural and aesthetic milieu. In other words, race rather than economics is prime, and any political philosopher worth his salt understands this.

                Ostei:  Well said.  I was going to refute ID and then decided not to bother.  He seeks attention and responses and I am willing to grant him neither.

                I agree wholeheartedly with OsteiWhile I’m not so sure my desire is 100% to live in a white ethnostate, I’d certainly trade a great deal of my material prosperity in order to live in a more harmonious society. My income is pretty close to that 100k that he mentioned, but I’m a divorcee who has dealt with a lot of personal conflict because of that circumstance. My children have not had the benefit of the ideal healthy unbroken family. I largely blame the racially contentious, anti-family, feminist, materialistic culture that envelopes us all. My motivations have never been about material comfort. Yet that’s all the society I live in has ever really offered me.

                    Because of their ages-old desire for trinkets, evolved into an unending desire for SUVs and other doodads, expensive and otherwise, women entering the workforce en masse and buying the feminist nonsense became pawns of the globalists, who want them working, making money, and spending it.  The WEF can’t put money in its pockets when American females are making a nice place for the husband to come home to and raising the kids.  The trad wife movement, social media-driven and as sometimes vapid as it is, is a step in the right direction.  I see so much unhappiness in women in the workplace.  Can’t fool Mother Nature.

                        By the way, Sumguy, I am so sorry for what you have been through with your family.  Working in the court system, I have been observing since the ’90s that Western civilization would be hard-pressed to survive no-fault divorce.  Many of the broken young adults we see are products of that process.  I hope your children are not among them.

                    Don’t worry about the Ashkenazim.  There is data accumulating that their oft vaunted position wrt IQ is declining as is everyone else’s.  This is attributed in part to the reverse Flynn effect and out marriage among the group. Their children are not scoring as high as the previous generations on aptitude tests and the like and prizes in fields they once dominated have declined.I apologize, but I just don’t have the inclination to dig up the citations for the studies.  I take little joy in the evidence building of general—or specific groups—intelligence decline.To quote John Donne: “… send not to know For whom the bell tolls, It tolls for thee. ”

                Reply to Ostei Kozelskii: “Whether acquisitiveness is evenly distributed among peoples is less clear, although I think not.”When I had my first grown-up job [i.e. something slightly moar significant than mowing lawns or babysitting or lifeguarding at a swimming pool, a job where I was in an ackshual professional situation involving life &amp; death situations &amp; decision-making on a regular basis], I eventually came to notice that amongst the kneegr0wz – even the smartest of the credentialed kneegr0wz [who were of course merely quota hires] – that even the smartest of the credentialed kneegr0wz never ever ever ever everdisplayed any sense of curiosity whatsoever.In particular, I realized that I had never in my entire life heard a kneegr0w start a sentence with the words, “Gee, I wonder why…”Nor the words, “You don’t suppose that…”The kneegr0w simply doesn’t seem to have the capacity to grasp the nature of the hypothetical.My suspicion is that the intellectual life of the average credentialed kneegr0w [masquerading as something other than a quota hire] is extraordinarily dull &amp; tangible &amp; prosaic.And I strongly suspect that the intangible is largely impossible for the kneegr0w to imagine.

                    While the information We proffer is hearsay, We can assure you that it is from a woman of the very highest intellectual caliber and discernment, to wit, asiatic IQs are ALSO vastly overrated. Working with them in scientific environments exploded the myth of the “asiatic IQ.” While fools continue to laud the Chinese, their historic, constant, and ongoing Theft of intellectual properties worldwide is too rarely advertised.

                        With regard to Asians, it’s perhaps best to ignore IQ arguments and reflect upon culture and behavioral traits to understand them.I do not believe their IQ ratings are “vastly overrated”—unless of course you feel a generally accepted 104-105 population IQ figure is a vast overstatement.  Asians should not be grouped as a whole, but at least divided into North and South Asians.  North being China, Korea, Japan.No argument that the Chinese have “stolen” a great deal of technology which gave them a great head start in development—as Lenin/Marx said (paraphrase) ‘we sold them the rope to hang us with’—our companies did business with them and allowed them to steal such technologies through voluntary exchange agreements.There is also no reasonable argument that Chinese are *not* currently producing new technology of their own and patenting it at a rate that beats the West.  This is not indicative of a backward of “average” society.  And of course we have Census statistics for the US showing Asian-Americans as having the highest SES of the population.

            The observation still holds however.  His main loyalty is to his people.  So the question is…are we his people?  Well, obviously not.  Therefore, when push comes to shove, he will ditch the DR if the choice is his people or us.I am not an anti-Semite (whatever the hell that is), but am becoming very weary of such folk as Shapiro in our midst.   Any of the talking heads—if not all—are either Jewish or Neocon or both.  They are all frothing at the mouth with talk of war.  I regard them a wolves in sheep’s clothing.  As Z-man points out, they sing a sirens song to lure you upon the rocks.War does not benefit a country on the brink of bankruptcy and in recession.

Especially when it’s not to defend our own lands and people. We’ve given enough blood and treasure fighting battles that were never our own.
If Ben Shapiro wants to go to war over this, he’s welcome to fly over there and jump into the fray. But of course, it’s so much better to spill goyish blood instead. It’s disgusting.

            Zion Ben was one of my first “conservative” listens when I started my journey from the Jose Mujica / Tony Benn paleo-socialist left to the (national?) socialist right.I tired of him after a few months, but I was attracted to the anti-tranny and anti-new-left stuff. He seemed smart, and he had some balls (for example he told a tranny she was mentally ill, and he told black people to their face they were being stupid) but all in all he was a terrible personality to foist on a new generation of online-right cultural conservatives. I don’t know what his appeal was, unless you like being lectured to by a forthright Semite with a whiny voice.

                Benemy is enemy.Perhaps we could give Benemy a few brave-points for speaking against trannys, but the tranny-promotion tribe is his tribe, and their tribe comes first, so he is in no risk.  He’s just doing his side of the kosher sandwich to distract from their treachery.Benemy is occupying political territory that could be held by one of ours.  He is propped up by his gang to control the narrative.  The income from his platform goes into his gangland not to one of our countrymen.  He is tipping the rudder to direct large sums of funds to flow into their clutches.

        Apparently today is The Day of Jihad, and all the moms in my wife’s social circle started freaking out about not taking public transportation, staying home, etc. etc. It was like a time warp back to the early 2000’s.I explained that the powers that be are trying to whip up the nation for another war, there is no good guy in this conflict, and they’ve played this script before, all the while trying to hold back the urge to punch a wall.I know there’s a lot of talk of normies waking up, but the truth is there’s a long way to go.

        If there weren’t so many gullible people there wouldn’t be such a big market for hucksters. Can’t very well solve the latter problem without addressing the former.I have a friend, God love her, who is a very loyal Alex Jones watcher. Even buys his “health” supplements. Which certainly isn’t all bad, at least she’s aware of how fake and gay everything is. I can talk politics with her and it isn’t like trying to communicate with space aliens the way it is with some people. But I have no doubt if Alex said it was time to be supporting Israel, or China, or Bangladesh or Peru, she would be right on board. And I also have a strong suspicion Alex is controlled to some degree – the way that whole Sandy Hook lawsuit went down made me very suspicious. But I digress.As long as globohomo lives and reigns, there is nothing that can be done to prevent it co-opting and controlling the media mouthpieces. They could even get to the ZMan if they wanted to. For all I know they could have already. One must remain perspicacious. But the majority just isn’t up to that. And never will be.

                STEM, so they probably still have sense, although I don’t know how pozzed it’s become. Guessing they eventually get sick of picking up slack for cheaters and bums, getting passed-over, and come around.

                    “STEM” signifies low testosterone and pathological obedience, not sanity. Hormonally normal boys only put up with school because that’s where the girls are. Nerds identify with it. When STEM does politics it does “scrupulosity,” a moralized/moralizing perversion of the fear of being noticed. How can the present-day American dweeb make himself invisible? (By becoming Chinese, Nietzsche would say.) By deciding that goodness and righteousness *consist of* letting bullies cheat off your test.

                        Well, I’m sad to report that all three of these guys are reasonably decent looking and in steady hetero relationships.
Well, except for the 26 year-old who just took his same-age Eastern European girlfriend of 7 years to Minorca for a week and didn’t propose.
I can understand why she’s mad. Her clock is ticking, and if she’s hung around you that long she’s probably interested in starting a family and building a life together.
It’s not all that cool to kind of string her along while her looks and fertility fade.

                        It is all about following rules, so you’re right about that.
Engineering, particularly mechanical engineering, attracts some chads, in my experience. Science draws nerds and half-nerds like me lol.
Still, if a guy’s masculine at all, the rule-breaking is really going to chafe.

                I took my wife to the eye doctor yesterday (she needed me to drive her home) and there was a Trans in the waiting room.Maybe – probably – that person loveshisgrandma, is kind to animals and has a decent job. All I could think was “youdon’t, and willnever, look like a girl, and anyone who says you do is lying right to your face.”I don’t care how many of these mental cases win “beauty” pageants or get photo spreads in fashion mags, there’s always something just a little off.Because they aremen.

                    As Dr. Albert Ellis said during an interview:“….there are homosexuals who are better adjusted than others; usually they’re less guilty about their deviation and don’t condemn themselves for it. ***I used to think that most homosexuals were neurotic. Now I think that maybe 50 per cent of themare borderline psychotics. *** [M]ost homosexuals I see are…seriously disturbed. And since they wrongly prefer to believe they were born as they are, they often refuse to work very hard at tackling basic problems.“The usual fixed homosexual is a severe phobic. ***It’s foolish and inhuman to make homosexuality a legal offense. But that hardly means it’s wrongto acknowledge that it’s a pronounced psychological disorder.“But I’m sorry to say that many of the other authorities who claim homosexuality is innate, thathomosexuals can’t change and should be adjusted to their handicap, are homosexuals themselves.”— Sexuality and Homosexuality, A New View (Arno Karlen) (1971) : Interviews with Dr. Albert Ellis, P. 223But I prefer the words spoken by Our Lord to St. Catherine:“They [the homosexuals] not only fail from resisting the weakness [of fallen human nature] …. but they do even worse when they commit the cursed sin against nature.Like the blind and stupid, having dimmed the light of their understanding, they do not recognizethe disease and misery in which they find themselves.For this not only causes Me nausea, but is disgusting even to the devils themselves whom these depraved creatures have chosen as their lords.“For Me this sin against nature is so abominable that for it alone five cities were destroyed by virtue of the judgment of My Divine Justice, which could no longer bear their iniquity ….“It is disgusting to the devils not because evil displeases them or because they find pleasurein good, but rather because their nature is angelic and flees upon seeing such a repulsive sinbeing committed.For while certainly it is the devil that first strikes the sinner with the poisoned arrow of concupiscence, nonetheless when a man actually carries out such a sinful act, the devil goes away.”Dr. Albert Ellis also said it best: “As for transsexuals, who want their penises and testicles amputated to make them ‘true’ women, can anyone doubt that practically all of them are out of their minds?  I’ve interviewed a dozen, all of whom tried to get me to help them be castrated. They were all paranoid schizophrenics.”

                The Wild Geese Howard: “At happy hour last night I listened to three white, normie, 25-35 year old males in STEM go on about how Dylan M. and Bud Light were just fine.”
I realize that it’s very likely that you don’t know the answer to the following question [and simply posing the question in the wrong circles could get you fired from your job], but do you know whether the STEM boys were j@bbed with the v@xx?

                    This is pure speculation on my part, but this being Western NY state I assume that all three of these fellows took at least one jab.
I am the only unjabbed person that I know. There is a significant anti-jab event being held next weekend, but I’m wondering if it will inadvertently serve as a honeypot for later financial cancelation by the banks.

        “On the other hand, is Ben Shapiro really on the Right?”If “right” is defined in vague and woolly terms like “cultural and economic conservatism” or “maintaining Judeo-Christian civilization” then that question will always remain. The Jews are interested in defining it that way. If “right” is defined as “white nationalism”, then the question evaporates away. Shapiro’s true colors have always been clear to me. I don’t listen to him.Jewish self-interest means making common cause with the goyim as far as Israel is concerned. Without the support of the goyim, Israel would never have come into existence or been able to sustain itself among hostile neighbors. Its survival today, as in the past, relies on goyim support. So in this regard we’re supposed to be one happy Judeo-Christian family united against the ragheads and camel jockeys.

        If someone calls you racist, he/she/it is definitely an enemy. But more importantly, the concept of racism as the greatest sin ever, is leftist mind plague. Racism is now supposed to be the worst possible transgression. Accepting that (insane) premise is submission to leftist brain cancer. I’m not advocating racism per se. We’re all racist to some degree; it’s nothing more than preference, mild or pronounced, for your own kind. It’s instinct. People who accuse others of racism are Satan’s minions. People who worry about racism have a left-hacked brain. “Racism” is a mind weapon being used to wipe us out.Ben Shapiro is pro immigration; that’s all you need to know about him.

            Pity —&gt; Bad conscience—&gt; Guilty conscience—&gt; Inversion. That’s the trick that got pulled, and I hate to say it, but imo time and depredation are the cure. Once people go soft, few have the discipline to get hard again— circumstances have to impose it. And if there’s anything tragic about America, it’s that we have so much seed corn to subsist on in the meantime.

                    I’ve been attending regional planning meetings since the spring. The meetings with speakers older than me leave me frustrated and angry. Younger than me, optimistic.Everybody speaks the fuzzy, educated dialect of the Marxist-feminist matrix, but the older set are concerned with maintaining standard of living while managing the deluge, while the younger hint that big changes are coming. One plays defense, while the other seems to at least be pondering that this is something we need to come to grips with. The young aren’t based by any means, but one sees the very first stirrings of it, from one’s experience.To your point about shocking events, I agree, and you can see it playing out in slow motion, because of the remaining seed corn.So I am optimistic, but impatient lol.

            The Left has no problem whatsoever with racism so long as it is worked against white people. In fact, that form of racism is coequal with condeming whitey as racist in the Leftist knifeblock.

                Notice their claim that it’s not racism when it’s against whites? You can’t argue with leftie, you can only reject. And when they flaunt the R word, it’s time to reject. Completely and irrevocably

        I feel sorry for the innocent people on both sides. The children, the elderly. The animals. I condem the people who are celebrating innocent people dying.
My solution: settle the Palestinians in Europe, Canada, or the USA. This would allow the Palestinians to not get murdered and Israel can have a threat removed.

                The really enlightening thing about those murders wasthis:  right wing twitterers who pointed out that the victim was killed by the criminals he/she championed were deemed WORSE people by Leftists than the actual murderer!
That’s really all you need to know about what’s going on.  Free the jogger murderer.  Lock-up the normal white guy who noticed what happened.

            The only way I would consider that, and I mean only and reluctantly, is if all Jewish dual citizens relocated to Israel, gave up all interests in companies doing business outside Israel, were removed from all banking institutions outside Israel, and of course goes without saying, were removed from all government positions other than those in Israel.  Then we could talk.

            “I feel sorry for the innocent people on both sides. The children, the elderly. The animals.”
I feel sorry for them, too. Because I am a Christian. Were I a Jew my religion would command me to kill them all without mercy:
“…attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.”

        The problem with Jason Kessler – and a very common problem among many in our thing – is that they don’t understand that “No enemies on the right” does not mean “No quality control on the right”. Refusal to understand this is exactly how the alt-,right ended up getting overrun by weirdos.

            I just want to point out that your “quality control” point is easier said than done.  Especially when there are so few who are willing to fight openly for our people.For example, I met Richard Spencer multiple times in 2016, including significant one-on-one time.  Other than his somewhat effeminate manner of speech, I saw no red flags.I remember having a conversation with him where he asked me about his plan to make the reality of race the foundation of his platform.  I encouraged him.  It was a bold plan.  He was willing to endure the firestorm of denunciation to advance the interests of our people.For a few years after that, he rallied our side like no one had before.  Let no one forget that he is exceptionally intelligent, educated, and articulate.When he first starting showing signs of narcissism, I wanted to cut him some slack.  To take on the world, maybe you have to be a bit crazy.“Quality control” is easy in retrospect.

                Hmmmm…First time I heard of Spencer was seeing a video of him on Amren, preparing to give a speech. Right away I thought he was a preening narcissist, what with all the cod-Hitler oratory gestures and smug manner. He ended up doing a lot of damage to the Right. But I think he’s a dupe rather than a plant. I remember briefly seeing a “debate” he had with LeBron and some other bakkaball dude: he looked like a bleating, shiny pink testicle.

                    Jannie:  I have mixed feelings about Spencer; have never met the man and have read and heard both good and bad.  BUT . . . why did you feel it necessary, in your criticism, to point out he looked ‘pink’ (as though that is something bad) in comparison to some joggers?White/pink is the natural color of those of European heritage.  I find it innately attractive and have never understood those who feel a visceral dislike for pale skin and a compulsion to tan.  I remember an old friend describing someone she knew in college whom she and others referred to as ‘n***er tits’ because a particular part of her anatomy was dark brown rather than pink.I like pink – for nail polish as well as body parts.  And I will always consider a particular former crayon shade as “skin color.”

                        I like fair skin too, but have nothing against tanning to a degree.  Tough to be a blonde-haired blue-eyed with a light gold tan.  But you don’t need to get sand n***er dark.
As for Spencer, same as you – only what I have read/heard about him.  Appears to have some issues, but in the end I think he is better for our side than Shapiro types.

                I never met Richard Spencer but I found some of his writing in the 2013-2016 time frame quite good.  I still read “Ghosts of Christmas Past” every year at Chrismas time.  I think Z-man described Richard’s problem well:  The strong narcotic of minor celebrity.

                    Even prior to 2013 I found Spencer’s podcasts on the “Alternative Right” website to be interesting.  There weren’t many podcasts back then, so I always looked forward to them.  He usually hosted interesting guests.He always seemed to relish taking a contrarian view and getting attention.  Now that there are a lot more joining our side recently, it seems like he wants to move away and differentiate himself from our circles.  He’s gone contrary view so much that he’s circled all the way around to being a Joe Biden fan!Here’s an example of projection and why I don’t value anything he says now:  Spencer is a proponent of the covid shot, even posting a picture of himself with an “I got vaccinated” sticker back then.  Interesting that during the last time he appeared with Mark Collett he accused our side of only rejecting the Covid shot because we were being contrarians to Biden and the mainstream agenda, not because of any research we’d done on it.

            I consistently get downvoted for making the same argument about posting comments here. The whole point of this blog is to reach normies who are slowly waking up, walking toward the river, or maybe have stuck a toe in the water. Zman writes carefully and wisely in an effort not to be perceived by normies as Zitler. If the comment section here devolves into the type of rhetoric you see on 4chan or Daily Stormer, we will be written off by normies as hopeless racists, thereby defeating the entire purpose of all the effort our esteemed host puts into the blog.If you are going to post a comment here, read it carefully from the perspective of a normie before you hit that Post Comment button. If you won’t do it for the sake of the blog or the community, then do it for your own self preservation. Without question, this blog is monitored by the ADL. It would be wise to assume that one day you will be doxxed by the ADL and all your comments made public and attributed to your name. Never write anything that would put your career or family in jeopardy if it were to be attributed to you.

                    People like you are the what present the quality control problem. You have four comments on this post and not a single one of them contains anything thoughtful. Nothing beyond snide, hateful rhetoric.
If you don’t have anything meaningful to contribute (and you don’t) then don’t comment. It’s really not that hard. Nobody gives $hit about you getting triggered by the tranny in the waiting room.

                Guest:  Zman’s blog; Zman’s rules.  Many (probably most) of us here strongly disagree with you, as you have noted disparagingly.  I don’t believe any of us need a self-appointed hall monitor to decide what language/thoughts are and are not appropriate.  It’s telling that you see yourself as a prophet rather than a gatekeeper.

        Not done with the show, but just want to note that it’s…off-putting that zealots like Shapiro want to genocide every Arab in the Gaza Strip Detention Facility because they subjected some Jews to abuse that White people have to tolerate daily from blacks.  It’s obvious that anyone spouting such nonsense, Jew or not-Jew, is not on our side since they would never afford us even a small slice of the same courtesy, and in fact would fight to the death to make sure we didn’t get it.

            Also, you would like to think that Shapiro is on the extreme end of his group’s opinion and yet he’s either being ignored by  fellow commenters or supported. He does appear to represent their mainstream  opinion.
It does appear that genociding their enemies is an unremarkable option for them. Is  this  the pivot for normal Westerners to truly understand the calls for eradicating us?
I’m rightwing but would consider genociding a people over a 1000 deaths an extreme overreaction.

                    I’m a musician so I’ve seen a few exceptionally intelligent and charismatic guys fry their brains with drugs, become childish, and need to be “cared for.” Peterson has definitely done that.
He has no thoughts anymore. Like anyone with dementia—very like our chief executive with no executive function—he rages and shoots off fragments of his former self.
Shapiro et al are exploiting a cripple.

        Absolutely right Z-man.  A survey of news and opinion sites now is little more than an orgasmic circle-jerk of folks trying to outdo themselves in their obeisance and fealty to jews and Israel.

Leading the way in all this of course are the conservatives, who still think they can they pry Jews away from their historic association with the Left.

            I’ve said for years that left-wing Jews (the majority – who treat patriot Jews like Zemmour and Stephen Miller like outcasts) would one day have to choose between their liberal beliefs and their blood. Well, it looks like that day has arrived.
