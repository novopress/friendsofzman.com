        […] I’ve been fond of the red pill-blue pill formulation to describe what is happening with non-liberals in America. It’s popular with the hobbits of the Dark Enlightenment so I never use the terminology, but it is a good way to describe what is happening. It’s not disillusionment.

        What is the underlying reason and rationale for Conservative, Inc.?  What principals animate it? Will and the pajama boys at National Review may have looked around and noticed that there are none, hence the tone of panic and petulant desperation: The Republicans don’t function as an opposition party, but as the condescended and barley tolerated junior partner of the Democrat’s Leviathan as it crushes and dismantles what remain of our liberties.

In the liberal histories, the Know Nothings are dismissed, if mentioned at all, as a bunch of crude bigots.  Are we witnessing something of a reprise here?  Plus ca change, as the French would say.

        “Something is happening but you don’t know what it isdo you, Mr. Jones”
Loves me some Dylan in the morning.
Krauthammer and Will are, for lack of a better word, portentuous. They are gravitas personified. It’s a pretty good act they have.
