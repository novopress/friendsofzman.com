        Idahoan here.  Corrections are needed:1) the influx of folks from CA, WA and OR has made the state more red and conservative; these are people who fled the Leftist totalitarian hellscapes forming in the coastal states to make a stand in the ‘Great Redoubt’.  After moving here from Oregon, I ran an analysis of party registration and voting records and found the state becoming increasingly Republican.  Many native Idahoans are naïve to the cynical power politics of the Left.  However, the influx of this new breed of conservatives is bringing people in who are wise to the ways of the Left.   School boards and college boards are finally being shaken up as the locals and most importantly, newcomers know it’s war.  The migration into Idaho is is not at all similar to the Colorado phenomena where Lefty snowflakes wanted to move for the air, the outdoors and good skiing.  In earlier years, snowflakes were moving to Boise for the cheap cost of living but that trend has been drowned by the new conservative migrants.Another correction. Here in N. Idaho folks are not at all welcoming of Californians.  Not a day goes by where I don’t see a “go back to California” or “Born and raised” bumper sticker.  However, once you establish your conservative street cred and ability to hunt, you’ve got some baseline respect.

            what would they think about canadians moving there?
actually, i still can’t even enter the USA at the moment, as an unvax leper, but assuming that the rule ends at some point, it’s worth considering.

                It doesn’t matter where you are from. If you are conservative you will be welcome.  There is an ongoing civil war here as the “far” Right is actively pushing the GOPe/RINOs out of seats of powers.  We’re organized here — the Idaho Freedom Foundation is a good example of this.   It’s a beautiful thing to watch happen, even better to participate in it and enjoy the gratification of making a difference.  Most folks I know here are unvaxxed pure bloods, but I curate my own social circle so there’s some selection bias.I built a house here so got to know the tradespeople. I’d say 9 out of 10 think a civil war is coming and are preparing accordingly.  The white collars are a mixed bag.  You still have mostly  grilling, F-150 CivNats but…the Dissident ratio here, in North Idaho specifically, is ridiculously high.

                    Good to know.
Re-location to the US is always on the back of my mind. Northern ID is definitely one of places that I’ve identified as a possible location.

        Z alluded to this in his pentultimate paragraph, but it bears fleshing out a bit–AINO is absolutely open to the Other, but is utterly closed to the Same. It welcomes with open arms non-whites and Leftist ideas, but repels with maximum prejudice whites and ideas on the Right. Leftist ideas are those that depart radically from the norm– they are Other. Rightist ideas are those that are rooted in tradition, custom and cultural continuity–they are Same. The point is that AINO’s openness only works on behalf of non-whites. Whites and their civilization are no longer tolerated on the very soil where they took root and fructified.

        It will never happen, but American should end all immigration except for native Europeans for the next 10 years. Get rid of 15m of the 23m illegals. Besides criminal/legal issues, make it vastly preferable for them to return to their countries-no public assistance benefits, and huge fines for those who employ them. Make strict English testing for all immigrants including those already legal. No immigrants can vote or hold public office till they have been legal for 20 years. Time to clean the house.

            Junger Generation:  If we’re theorizing about things that will never happen, why stop short?  Why end all non-European immigration for only 10 years – why not forever?  Why expel only 15 million illegals when there are realistically about 40 million?  What about all their pseudo American-born magic dirt children?  Why should any immigrant be able to hold public office ever?
I struggle to understand the mindset of people who wishcast but are always careful to remain within certain parameters.

                If we wish to abandon all parameters, then let’s fantasize about Whisrael. Its creation is no more unlikely than all this folderol about expulsions and ending immigration.

                Still, good to keep a model of our ideal world, and work towards that. You are correct that change won’t come overnight though, and will probably take decades or generations. And we can’t get blinded by utopian thinking.

Don’t know if it’s been mentioned, but apparently, James O’Keefe is being ousted from his own organization.

                But fascism also contains a cultural or even racial element. It is not necessarily racist, but it is chauvinist. Not that there’s anything wrong with either of those, mark you. Heaven forbid!

        Having recently moved from California to Florida, I can attest to the fact that the locals are welcoming but I also have gotten oblique questions that roughly translate as “Did you leave  California because of the wingnuts running the place or are you one of the wingnuts?” Having chosen a part of Florida where lefty wingnuts are thin on the ground, this may not be surprising. Most of them assume the former as default.As an aside, Florida does have a brief waiting period for voting for newcomers, which I heartily endorse and which also meant I couldn’t vote last November — as if voting makes that much difference anyhow.

            Florida transplant here as well. Though I moved from the Midwest so I don’t have that Cali or NY stink all over me.
There is anecdotal evidence going round that lefties are leaving Florida because they feel “less welcome”. Inshallah, and cheers to that!

                It would blow my mind if Florida pulled that off before Texas did, but I hope it’s true. Spidey sense says it’s a whisper marketing campaign. Real estate or DeSantis ‘24, take your pick.

                I saw a news story about that where the headline made it sound like a movement, but in the story they quoted one gay couple who were leaving, or thinking about leaving (I forget which) because the state was becoming too conservative.

                    Jeffrey Zoar:  I’ve seen similar one-off stories about this or that family returning to Cali.  Unfortunately, they’re more than offset by the tons still moving into Texas and elsewhere.  And the ‘welcoming locals’ often aren’t locals in the true sense of the term.  And they’re always always always led by women.

                When the singer Julee Cruise kicked last year it was reported she wanted her ashes scattered over Arizona for some idiotic MSNBC reason (she was from the Upper Plains like her collaborator David Lynch). Making allowance that such obituary cutesies are only ever seriously intended for the departed to impress the media— how dumb do you have to be to think Arizona is a “red state” except poetically/metaphorically perhaps? Ironically one way to blue it up would be to shut down the stoop laborer tractor beam.

        “ Americans would rather die than be mean to newcomers.”
Not me.  My partial “solution” is to deny voting rights to newcomers.  For example, you must continuously reside in “your” new State for say, 12 years in order to vote.  Similarly, new “migrants” to the USA do *not* obtain the right to vote as I’d require birthright citizenship for voting priv’s.
Does this sound harsh or strange?  Check out other nations and their requirements for citizenship and voting priv’s.  Only is the Western world….

            The president has to be at least 35. Then why shouldn’t anyone voting for president also have to be at least 35? Makes sense doesn’t it? Likewise the president has to be a natural born citizen. So shouldn’t anyone voting for him also have to be natural born? Where is the flaw? And if these things should be true for the president, then why should they not be extended to other public offices?

                No flaw in such thinking.  Unfortunately the Founders did not consider such.  Like a fish in water, they assumed such an environment—that is to say, they assumed Northern Europeans as the entering immigrants.  They specifically excluded Indians and Blacks.  So really there were no others of concern as franchise holder.

        This isn’t just about immigration. It’s a core principle, perhaps the core principle, of American foreign policy that a “free” country will always defeat a “non-free” country. And America, of course, is always the “free” country, because it is America, never mind what it has turned into. Never mind the tiny sample size on which this core principle is based, never mind the military setbacks that are memory holed. America will always win because America is “free.”This explains a lot about American foreign policy that otherwise appears misguided or reckless. It only looks reckless until you realize that America is invincible! Because it is “free”!As per immigration, Jesus was indeed a refugee, along with his parents. Then they went back! They also just went next door, because that’s what real refugees do, they didn’t cross oceans and continents, passing through half a dozen other countries first until they found the richest one to settle in and collect gibs.

        It’s also easier to move around American cities, because as Gertrude Stein once said, “there’s no there there.”  I’m by no means a hippie dippy, but some of the few pleasant towns in which to be located in Amuricahh are solidly white, solidly upscale left wing towns.   Some artist actually takes time to paint flowers and trees on an electrical box housing traffic signals.   Every other house has the “Little Free Library” in a front yard garden, where I place dissident books at 2AM.  These towns have a very stiff barrier to entry…which is money.Since Muricahh’s culture was replaced with buying new underwear at Target, all cities are the same.  The same Costco, next to the same Best Buy, next to the same Walmart with assorted fast food, people in line at Panda Express….etc, with the same cinderblock industrial looking public schools……hmmmm….almost…..Soviet….only with 24 Hour Fitness.Even though Euro-cities are getting this way, they’re old enough to still have a sense of place, and should you be from there, you likely know when you’re not in your city.

                    In eventually will. The Beast has to be fed, and Whites becoming a minority will cause those at the upper echelons, including “Whites, eventually to feel it.
The template is SALT. The assumption was once Trump was gone this White upper middle class goodie would be restored. Nope.

                    HUD doesn’t need to diversify MV because Obama already did. At the end of the day he’s just an articulate, uppity “house” boy instead of a field hand. Neither belongs on this side of the tracks. Maybe MV should start building a train to nowhere, like California.

                    The Vineyard has been diverse for some time. Its place as the holiday home for NYC elites is quite recent in the grand scheme of things. Of course the dispatching of the Latino illegals there to the mainland  preceded the bank robbery by the Jamaican illegal landscapers, so maybe they’ll let a few back in.

            “ The same Costco, next to the same Best Buy, next to the same Walmart…”Yeah, I always go to these places when on a vacation just for the experience.  However, I understand your definition of sameness in that the stores sell the same crap, the layout is the same, etc.  My definition  is a bit different.Example, here in my State, Walmart is a horror.  The “People of Walmart” is a real experience—and it’s not just minorities, but White trash as well. My daughter for example will not step inside one.  She has refused since she was a teenager! (Smart kid)   However, when I stepped inside one in Montana the experience was a pleasure—like night and day.  It’s the people as much as the store and it’s marketing concept.

                Compsci:  Husband and I deliberately checked out the local Walmart before we decided to move to the area we’re moving to (same as we checked the local schools on SchoolDigger for demographics of the children).  Yes, it’s still Walmart – but overwhelmingly White families with 3 or more kids, and the pharmacist and all the cashiers were White.

            I live in one of those towns you describe.  It was more middle class/blue collar in the past but has become a haven for David Brooks’ “bo-bo” types.  During 2020 there were numerous BLM signs, along with the judgy “in this house we believe…” stuff.  Over the past few months most of the Ukraine shit has been quietly put away.  These people all profess to love diversity but where they’ve chosen to live is like 98% white.

        Liberalism, or wokeism, or Americanism, whatever you want to call it, is most certainly a religion. What’s interesting about it is that there is no redemption baked in, and seemingly no positive fruits either. Yet people are unable to let it go.You are inherently evil for being white, for being an oppressor, and because your ancestors did some mean things to non-whites. As a result, you need to be really nice to non-whites, you need to give them stuff, and you need to essentially sacrifice yourself in favour of them. You especially need to try and make non conforming white people’s lives miserable and make them submit to this. Despite this, you are always evil and no matter what you do, it’s not enough. No salvation.This is crazy. But if there were positive fruits coming from these morals, maybe it could be understandable. However, there aren’t. The results are destroyed families, no children/grand children, children with amputated genitals, weakened and spiritually broken men, drug addicts, and increasing racial tensions. More or less completely destroying everything and leaving nothing but a bunch of foreign people who never cared about the ideology and still don’t like you.Boomers talked 60s, lived 50s. People today are true believers and yes the above is taking place in many liberal families. It all seems to have come out of nowhere, although it was percolating on the sidelines for a while. People will agree that it’s wrong, but then go right back to worshipping it.There seems to be only 2 options. 1) let it burn out, let the susceptible people die out of the gene pool. hope that there are still some sane white people left over. 2) get in charge of the megaphone and impose better values on these people. I don’t think they will ever “figure it out”.Being a sheep has great benefits. When the herder is marching the herd off a cliff, it’s better to be an outcast. We may be outcasts from the “Openness” herd, but it’s the best position to be in at the moment.

                You have to get a sex change. That’s the only way. Even being gay isn’t enough.
I figured out a long time ago that being a white male from a southern state, there would never be any redemption for me (barring that). That was the realization led to me embracing my identity rather than apologizing for it, along with the realization that when whites become a minority we aren’t going to get preferential minority treatment.

North-Western European. You won’t hear about the benefits of diversity among the average Italian, Greek or Eastern-European. Most of them will be very comfortable telling newcomers to go back where they came from.Even the French and Spanish are nowhere near as welcoming and open to immigration like Americans.

“He cannot explain why he thinks closing the border is wrong, he just knows it.”
Disagree with this statement.  The (normal) people of Maine, North Dakota and Minnesota can articulate quite clearly why they do not want more Somalis or blacks or browns in general.
In Montana, where they’re flooding the state from everywhere around the country and globe, normal people (not statists) can tell you in no uncertain terms why the borders of both the state and country should not be “open”.

                Right you are Ivan.
Most polls show that a majority of citizens oppose open borders. That is not the problem.
The problem is that what the people want doesn’t matter much. Where Billionaires like Soros pour in their money money is what matters. Big money trains us how to think. If an election is close, they will simply divert your attention away from immigration control and make an issue out of those o’standbys, abortion, racism, or white supremacy.
The people voted for a Big Beautiful Wall, but got a translucent linen curtain instead.

            I live in France and it is just as open to invaders as the United States; and the invaders (Arabs and Africans) aren’t even as close to the native French as Hispanics are to European-origin Americans.  The island of Corsica is an exception and they are roughly as hostile to people of non-Corsican French origin as they are to non-European invaders.
Southern European and eastern European countries haven’t yet been subject to the same pressures because they are relatively poorer and less attractive.  Some of them (e.g., Hungary, Serbia) will resist invasion better than others (e.g., Slovenia, Croatia).

                France may be open to invaders but France’s native population is way more anti-immigration than Americans. Someone like Le Pen would never make it far in US elections, unless she loudly pronounced that she wants millions of legal immigrants (like Trump did).

        Speaking of Colorado, here is a good summary of how the Left destroyed it:

It’s sad Fort Collins was ground zero because it is a great small city.
Also note Ted Gill was one of the destroyers. He’s a software billionaire that’s been pushing the alphabet agenda all over the place.

        “Like the Idahoans, Americans would rather die than be mean to newcomers.”
I see what you did there, Z 😀 American openness as life in prison but effectively a death sentence. Twists the mind in knots, doesn’t it? Why? Because they see themselves, as Americans, as newcomers, too.
Time to adult, my country!

                    Tars:  Authentic Spanish food – which is very Mediterranean – is delicious.  Mexican, not so much.
We make it an ironclad policy to never, ever patronize a small, rural town Mexican or Chinese restaurant (or nail place).  You do not want to subsidize or encourage the invaders who’ve got the first toehold.  Starve them out.

                        Great idea. I go one step further, and never patronize any of the following:– ethnic restaurants in white areas (I do on very rare occasion try a new restaurant)– fast food chains– any kind of restaurant or establishment hiring a large number of aliensI have all the white gas stations mapped out. And I’ve stopped at all kinds of little white person burger joints, pizza shops, and fry shacks. Some good, some bad, it’s a great way to explore different places. And I’m not giving money to people who hate me.99% of the time I just eat at home though. To be honest my health is pretty good just from home cooking week after week.

                    Ah. The name came to me, forgive the misspelling: Mollie Tibbetts. I believe that the father may have been from Idaho/Iowa (one of the I’s).
If memory serves, his daughter was killed by a beaner (hilarious term, needs more usage) – and in a press release he was full of zeal for his new countrymen. That said, who knows what he really thought.

        “Therefore, the more open a system is to new people and ideas, the faster it will mutate and improve into something better than the original.”The simple fact here is thatmost people’s ideas suck. Almost all hard and tiresome intellectual progress (i.e., in the scientific realm) has been made by either one or a handful of very dedicated men. For the sake of diversity we can throw in Emmy Noether and Marie Curie, of course; but gender aside – these two were also very devout in their work.In the software world, a person’s idea of improvement seems to be to just build something to replace what was already there, but that they have not been bothered to understand. This results in “more resource” (read “plenty o’ browns) being hired to build a “better” solution. And here’s the thing: the solution already in-place worked – it just needed a bit of TLC and not the hubris of certain developers to re-invent it, often at considerable cost and technological debt.The line of yours that I quoted Z is very timely, as it arrives just when I find myself in the midst of a needlessly complicated “re-modelling” software project. Why have a simple LAMP stack, when you can have nifty microservices communication with each other via queues! This project has become an in house joke, all the while, the “legacy” software it was meant to replace is still putting in a good performance. It just needs a bit of updating: new PHP version, new framework, new OS version and a bit of database tuning.But no! We must have the bells and whistles! And do you know why? Fashion and hubris amongst high-level “software architects”. You could have made the “legacy” application a good offering with two or three hardened and dedicated developers and minimal management – i.e., a tightly closed system. They’d have got the job done. But no! Outsource first to the Spanish and then to the Bengalis! Lord have mercy!I’ve noticed in my years in the corporate software world how much make-work there is. And there seems to be plenty of fiat currency to throw at it. The attitude in this Global World is to Think Big! Offshore It! Get a massive team with minimal common language skills and working hours! Give me two hardened English developers and a systems administrator and we’ll do wonders! Where are we going! May He have mercy on all our Prideful displays!A closed system indeed. A closed selective system that concerns itself with merit and Bob’s your uncle. Standards are continuing to drop and general competence seems to be at a low. When recruiting for network engineers with five years experience, what does the recruiter send me? A graduate with Python experience!Sorry, don’t mean to take away from your post with my rant. Just thought I’d vent. That’s what dealing with offshore “Team mates” will do to you!

A corollary to Z’s point about ‘openness’ – the emphasis on always re-inventing or recreating something that already works and has stood the test of time.  That, I would argue, is also a very ‘American’ characteristic.  The hubris that new is always better, the fallacy that novelty equals quality.  “Progress” as the eternal antidote.

                3g,New is always better! I’m nearly forty, and some of youngsters that are coming through the door (and these are native English) are really something else: leftist politics and sloppy work.We had one individual, newly recruited as a marketing person – well, the communiques that this person sent out were not only full of spelling errors and read like something a ten year old put together.Look, I feel sorry for these youths – they’ve been completely spoilt by the Devil (who has rights over them due to their distance from Him) and nobody to guide them. They think it is all acceptable!Trusting that You and Yours are well and safe and prepared. God bless.

                New is not always better, but often more profitable.A long time ago, I had a good friend who was the software manager for Microsoft Office, Word, product line.  I invited him to my department to talk about MS Office development and marketing.   (My invitation got him a free vacation to my State)Make a long story short, he (inadvertently?) explained how his team continuously adding bells and whistles, changing the “look and feel” so that they could  release upgrades and new versions several times a year and make money from consumer purchases.  (Large corporations often have policies to buy the latest versions automatically.)At the end of the talk, there was a call to the audience requesting suggestions for software upgrades the “next version” of MS Office, Word.  I raised my hand and asked if there could be a “switch/option” to roll back the new look and feel to the previous version of “Word”.  In short, make version 2.6 look and perform like version 2.5.  Stunned silence in the room and a puzzled look from my friend.I then began to explain that in memory, I could not note when a new release of MS Word had a new “feature” of interest, but could relate how the secretarial staff would take weeks to months to get used to the new software and the diminution of productivity during that time and the increased calls for support I’d constantly receive.Now of course, you don’t buy software, you simply “rent” it (subscription) and MS has their hand in everyone’s pockets, which was the stated goal of Bill Gates from the very earliest days and I assume the pressure is off to obsolete older versions a bit.  I myself, never “rent” software.  But that’s just me.

Even better, if you log an old laptop onto the internet these days (before microsoft turned word into a service)  They’ll tell you that you need an update and then delete word from your PC.  I’ve heard windows 11 is even worse with regards to spying on you and sending your data all over the place.  If we lived in a capitalist system, we’d let a depression happen to clear all the dead brush from the system and allow new growth.  We don’t do that.  So what system do we live in?

                        If we were growing, interest rates wouldn’t need to stay near zero and people wouldn’t consider 5% a sky is falling interest rate.  If we were growing we wouldn’t need to rely on QE because of a “pandemic” (shoulda been a bigger tell to ya  before you noticed that everyone wasn’t dying).  In a growing economy costs would actually go down due to efficiency gains, not go up 2% every year as your stated goal (you only do that to make your debt slaves lives 2% better then the year before by making their burden that much lighter).

            The more fake money you inject in a system that doesn’t require it (you aren’t growing the economy, just adding more money) the more make work you’re gonna get.  Computers have come a long way since i was a lad, but honestly the last 20 odd years has just been funny money flowing into your industry.  In a way the DOT com bubble never ended.  It popped in 2000, but was reflated via housing, which popped in 2008, which was reflated with the full faith and credit of good ole uncle sam if you catch my drift.  If prices have been super inflated since the DOT com, just think how far they have to fall!  The only export and growth industry left in the US (and its failing now) is DEBT

                “In a way the DOT com bubble never ended.”
It does seem like this. I’ve had countless interviews for positions over many years, and I’ve always asked about why a certain company wanted to undertake Project X (which was clearly make-work). They never give a real answer, but the real answer is “because that is what everyone else is doing”.
The real innovation in computing happened at Bell Labs! Not DropBox or Apple.

                    Ha you mean all the APPS we’ve created that last 10 years don’t create value?!?!?!Its funny, a lot of people won’t admit that growth as we’ve known it since the end of WW2 is over.  Until a source of energy is created/found that provides energy cheaper then fossil fuels we’re on a slow fall down the stairs with intermittent moments of jarring pain.  If you ever watched the TV show Silicon Valley in the early 2010’s it was obvious it was all a bubble.  Without corresponding “real” growth adding money to the system only creates inflation.  And what are stock value gains without growth other then inflation?  When this sucker falls apart so many people are going to be blindsided.  And if you thought the cries for help were stupid and overwhelming during covid, just wait for the financial system to go (which in my opinion is why they unleashed covid).

            Software is the one field of “engineering” that is most susceptible to fantasy based thinking. The problem is that there’s no physical product present so a good sales presentation, especially if it’s encrusted with the latest woke buzzwords can be used to slip ideas through that would never be considered in any other field.A case in point is the fixation on Python. Python’s type system is practically non-existent and leads to chronic problems with run-time errors. Strongly typed languages will find many such problems at compile time. This is frustrating for the developer but saves time in the end since it avoids having bugs get to production. Python is also the slowest commonly used language and has a thing called the global interpreter lock (GIL) that prevents it from running multi-threaded code efficiently. When you ask people why they chose it for a project they just mumble something about “developer mindshare” and how “there’s lots of AI stuff for it” (whether the project has any need for AI or not). Then you add in the industry obsession with the “Agile” cult. The central ritual is this weird daily “stand-up” performance where you seriously are supposed to get up and tell your fellow cube monkeys all about what you did yesterday in a kind of unfunny stand-up comedy routine.I still have some fading hopes of finding a software job where people are just concerned with getting the job done but when you see the industry from the inside you quickly realize that most of the people involved don’t know what the job even *IS*. Quality, fast, well documented, bug free code that correctly implements the business logic? Fuck no. It’s social justice and “AI readiness” and “openness” and being “REST-ful” and Web 3.0 and company culture…It’s no wonder the Indians are successful in this field. They mostly don’t understand the technology but are very good at listening to whatever pompous virtue signalling gibberish the self-consciously “nerdy” White hipster IT types are saying and then feeding it back to them – with a side of curry and a huge bill.This has been going on for a long time though. Many years ago I worked on a project to convert a real estate company from using a system based on a Vax 4300 minicomputer (the agents used Vax terminals with dial-up modems) over to a system based on Windows 95 PCs connected over the internet to a Windows application server. The project was not only pointless (the Vax mini worked fine and was no where near capacity) but actually destructive. Even the non-IT people here can imagine the disastrous reliability and security problems the Win95 PCs and app server had.

                Pozymandias,Where do I start with your detailed response?The GIL. I encountered problems with this piece of Python implementation some years ago, but haven’t checked in to see if they’ve “fixed” it. Your point about people knowing why they use languages is a good one, most don’t or give you a buzzword answer. I used C for everything for ten years because I knew it, it was small and changed rarely. It was also easy to understand because of it’s lack of abstractions. Basically: all you need are files, structs and functions and you can organize you code well.As to Python’s runtime problems – the same applies to a host of other languages in the “scripting” family. I do wonder why there are so many language and it does seem like people just like to build stuff. The only remotely revolutionary new language that has come about of late is Rust – whose typing, reference checking and garbage collection are handled in a very innovative way.You speak the truth about Indians. Very few are capable of taking the lead and designing something. Even if you provide a tight spec, there’ll be a billion questions – mostly revealing that Sudapresh did not even read said spec. They seem most comfortable when given a firm steer, which may be what is required but maybe not. It is remarkable to me, having witnessed the poor quality of off-shore personnel, that more English haven’t broken into the field. But our people have their own problems.You’re correct to focus on well-documented and bug free (as much as possible) code. This is why I don’t use OOP – I just spend too much time getting confused with all the abstractions and “higher-level” thinking, and end up neglecting my core algorithms because I need A to inherit from B that must be a friend class of C – a load of old cobblers. Correctness of code and it’s documentation (whether in the source itself or elsewhere or both) should be primary goals. We can worry about speed later.In any case, I got sick of the coding side and moved into DevOps, where I’ve got a lot more autonomy. Even if I am just writing Bash shell scripts! I can document all I want!

        Not only is the Jewish funded NGO’s responsible for this catastrophe the Hobby Lobby Christians play a role in this open society idea.Much of christianity has turned into a rock concert with the idea that the apostle Paul’s primary goal was not debating Christianity in Athens, the real goal of the apostle Paul was to import Ethiopians into Athens because “Jesus was a Refugee”.Idiots.And I am a christian.

        “You cannot move from Boston Massachusetts to Nashville Tennessee if the people in these areas are naturally hostile to strangers. The typical person from Tennessee may think the typical person from Massachusetts is a mean word, but both people assume it is immoral to exclude someone based on their place of origin.”This is no longer really true. In this excerpted example, the Tennessee legislature has broken the Nashville congressional district into many parts to disempower it and the foreigners who have flocked there. The influx of strangers probably has prompted the state to embrace social policies contrary to the prevailing ideology of the Regime. Is deterrence to migration the reason? Probably.The same is happening in Florida, a far bigger and more populous state. DeSantis may be and likely is politically posturing, but his legislature is making the state into the polar opposite of California. Disney, a big deal in both California and Florida, has been put squarely in the crosshairs by Tallahassee. Like many states, there is an unrelenting crackdown on CRT and transgenderism.Localities are following suit at an increasing pace. Even Virginia is seeing this at the local school board level. Rural Washington and Oregon are fighting rearguard actions that seem, in part, designed to keep out in-migrants and rhetorically threaten dissolution complemented with concrete action.I would go so far as to say the increased separatism in the examples above and elsewhere are green shoots. They certainly are not panaceas, but they hold open the promise of de facto dissolution, which seems to be happening even now.

            I’m living with the consequences of this influx of Yankees into Florida every day, when I have to risk death every afternoon driving home from work. They clutter up our inadequate roads and can’t drive worth a damn.It doesn’t help that the developers own our local politicians and can do as they please, putting up endless high rise hotels on our beaches and ruining them for the locals. Young people have to leave when they grow up because they can’t afford to live in this state with the sky high cost of rent.Pretty soon we will be nothing but a massive nursing home with nobody to do the work. We already have a big labor shortage.

                Vermont is ironically a better model for preserving White demographics than Florida.
All the GOP states have a “build more”, “bigger is better” mentality. That means that over time the state will simply become blue as it takes in more internal and external migrants. As we saw with Georgia and Arizona, soon Texas and NC.

        Generally speaking, Americans have always been viewed by the average European as very open people who are welcoming and friendly. Well, maybe not in New York city so much, but everywhere else. 😉When it comes to openness in Europe, the Dutch are probably THE most open people. While Germans on the other hand, tend to be much more closed and generally less friendly. Ask anyone who has been stationed here in the military. It takes years for Americans to get to know their German neighbors. But once that friendship is established over two or three years, it’s a lot deeper and more sincere than what we generally refer to as a typically superficial American friendliness.But it also depends on where you find yourself in Germany. In the south, Bavarians are notoriously unfriendly, while those in the west and in particular the northern coastal areas are much more open and welcoming. I think coastal regions in most countries are like that. Which is why Switzerland is nearly hostile to outsiders, even those from bordering Cantons.Currently, the influence of the Green Party and our less than brilliant, milk-toast Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD), are taking the country in completely the wrong direction. They are pushing for more open borders, even beyond the EU to welcome in anyone who wants to come here. If you look at Greens in the UK, Scotland, Ireland and other European countries, they are also pushing for more open borders, and even more diversity. At least Poland, Hungary and now Italy are saying “No thank you!” despite EU pressure.Of course we all know immigration has been a complete disaster for the UK and France. Sweden has been learning a very painful lesson. No thanks to Angela Mekel’s decision to accept over 1 million refugees in 2015, the flood gates are now open and a trend has become the norm. And with the on-going proxy war in Ukraine, the refugee situation will only get worse resulting in more coins drained from the government coffers, while public and social services for German citizens who have built and paid for this country, will continue to decline.Does that sound familiar?The Germany I grew up in will be a completely different country when my Grandchildren are my age. In 100 years, Germany will be nothing more than a name on a map. It’s culture, history and way of life swept away by the ongoing flood of humanity that cares nothing for this country or the people who built it. They will hang their home flags out their windows, cheer for the homeland football teams, and point their satellite dishes east and south. And when things don’t go their way, scream that all Germans are Nat-sees and racists.

            You are correct that that is the trajectory of Germany today, but it doesn’t have to be that way. It can change, but the probability of real change is dependent upon the rate of decline. If the decline is very slow and incremental, people will continue to adapt downward until its too late (boil the frog slowly). But if the decline is rapid and shocking (3 days without a meal), then there will be an uprising because its either act or starve. We are wired by our ancestral genes to move when the danger is clear and present.

            The “Native Americans” did get it.  However, by the time they got it, there were too many of us to stop it.  Prior to that, they (some anyway) saw us as useful in their ancient conflicts with fellow Native American tribes.  Once we got a toe hold…
Ironic parallels come to mind looking at our current situation.  The Native Americans have tribal lands to fall back upon and see them through this present crisis of replacement.  Whites should only be so lucky (we won’t).

This x1000. I highly recommend Francis Parkman’s “France and England in North America.” They raped, murdered and ate each other with joyous abandon before our ancestors showed up, and thought they were clever in involving us in their schemes against their neighbors.
Nowhere on this Earth have semi-agricultural or itinerant tribes successfully resisted conquest by agricultural nations. The only thing unique about the Amerindian experience is that they were the last to fall.

                    It’s ironic how what’s now happening is a weird inversion of that rule you mention in your last paragraph. Perhaps another iron law of history is going to turn out to be that decayed, multicultural post-industrial societies cannot resist reconquest by third world savages. The Mestizos, Arabs, and Sub-Saharans overrunning Europe and North America are not exactly itinerant stone-age tribes but are similarly low in societal organization and wealth. It seems modern Western Man is too weak physically (but primarily psychologically) to resist displacement by the same sort of people his ancestors so easily pushed aside.There’s a cackling Salon article in there somewhere.

        I like what TomA said. This is a very nice post. I feel like pressure is building on the dam. I could be wrong, but I think the people who know this replacement migration is wrong, but just aren’t willing to stick their necks out and say – migration moratorium for 10 years are going to start losing their fear to speak up. One reason people don’t isn’t just the fear, it is the lack of what I call an incontrovertible pairing. Immigration is inextricably linked to our education system of sinecurism and entitlement and the welfare state. Stop paying people not to work who are already here and they will work and you take away the labor shortage argument.The key is to be able to put forth a plan that has the proper incontrovertible pairings that are practically and morally sound. But you are right Z-Man. That fear stops a lot from thinking through to the obvious and logical pairings.I love the insight of this post. One other fatal idea that we adopted on mass is the notion of failure as a virtue. How many TED talks and goofball CEOs and Investors prattle on and on and on about how failure is good. They take an obvious, and frankly banal, observation and make it seem like some genius virtue. The problem is, through the 19th century in Britain and America in particular, innovators were failing in their workshops with their own money or the money of a wealthy benefactor willing to lose it.They have taken this and applied it to global finance where people experiment with huge amounts of capital and destroy small businesses or even entire industries while they, “disrupt”, an industry. If they ever do make a profit, they didn’t create new wealth, they just transferred it and wreaked a lot of destruction in the process.So, failure is not a virtue and mass failure is a very stupid and destructive idea. Failure is another thing we need to get out of mass society. Besides, if it was happening in garages and small workshops again, it would lead to far better, truly innovative creations.Consequences and Accountability have gone missing in the name of Openness(TM) and Failure(TM). The question is, how do we ensure that the consequences for their failings fall first and heaviest upon the purveyors and practitioners of them?

            I’ve never thought of it this way. Not sure what Uber’s financials are, but they got rich while cabbies got poor. Nothing new was created, just transferred (hijacked).
The highjackers are private equity and wall st. I wonder whose livelihood they “disrupt” (plunder) next?

                Amazon sent many higher margin profitable retailers out of business. They were a tech company so they could borrow money and lose it hand over fist, crushing physical retailers. Then the high stock valuation allowed them to pay off the debt  and build a business out of the ashes of destruction. They make their money off of AWS and Ads even still.Tesla has the same model. Assume debt, survive until the hype pushes the valuation of the stock into the stratosphere, issue shares to pay off the bonds.Uber I think has only been profitable once. Can they transition to profitability using the same vulture model? We will see.Perhaps the Covid-19 debt jubilee cover up and the Build Back Better are a sign/admission that there may not be enough “disruption” opportunities left to keep the ponzi afloat. Time will tell.Something is rotten when failure becomes a celebrated virtue.

        “Paradoxically, the most tolerant and open culture in human history is violently intolerant of anyone suggesting that there must be a limit to tolerance and openness.”
The list of contradictions keeps growing.  You have to be intolerant to people who disagree with total openness. You have to save democracy by limiting who can participate in it.  You have to restrict free speech to protect it.  Libertarianism is impossible because to maintain it you must violate its principles. You can’t crack down on monopolies because of capitalism worship.  Beyond believing in God, it’s hard to believe in anything anymore.

        “We will never see a campaign by one region to block the migration of people from another region, even when it is terrible for the receiving end.”There are small sprouts of resistance in some areas. In my home state of Texas, there were more than a few stickers on vehicles with the phrase, “Don’t California my Texas.” Whether concrete actions are taken to prevent the influx of west coast refugees from turning Texas into Commifornia remains to be seen, but one can hope.I tell everyone that I am a Texan in exile for the moment in California. Driving back for visits over these last few years, more than a glance or two has been given to my California plates. Then they hear my accent and realize I’m one of them.

            ArthurinCali:  Bumper stickers are as effective as teddy bears and candles – i.e. not at all.  When we moved to Texas in the mid ’90s (husband had essentially gown up here), perhaps 25% the people I met were native Texans.  Now, although I don’t socialize with strangers, based on accent alone I’d guess that at most 10% of Whites (who are perhaps 20% of those I see out in public) are native Texans.While some of the smaller towns are perhaps still okay, the population centers are as cancerous as any large east coast city.  Austin has been filled with east coast libs forever and now, under the careful auspices of its jevvish mayor, has imported a blaq problem.   San Antonio has always been predominantly mestizo.  Houston is as third-world as New York.  DFW is slightly more upscale than Houston but just as alien.If I had a fiat buck for every NY/Cali/Chicago emigrant to a ‘red state’ who claimed (either in real life or online) to be a Genoowine Conservatard, I’d have a nice little nest egg.  Add in the massive influx of squatemalan mestizos and the hundreds of thousands mosque attendees, and Texas is deep purple.  Doesn’t particularly matter whether it’s officially majority D or R when even before the the mass importation of people Texans elected people like Bailey Hutchison and Cornyn.  When we first moved to our ‘burb there was a big conflict over the exiting jevvish head of the school board, whose wife was the former mayor  (this in a county of approximately 0.3% jevvs).Democracy and open immigration destroyed any trace of independent character Texas ever had.  Cannot wait to get out of here.

                Texas is an outlier in many ways. I cited some state and local examples, and there are many, in an earlier comment that seem deliberately aimed at deterring in-migration. That isn’t explicitly stated, of course, but is the net effect.
Texas, it seems to me, is more wed to Austrian economics and the Almighty dollar than self-preservation and is on a suicide mission. Frankly, so were other places until recently but the trend is in the other direction now in many of them.

                    Abbott is good at political posturing but nothing else.  He knows in his conservatard heart that a massive influx of Californians to Texas proves his faux-ideological superiority.  Plus lots of tax dollars.  We paid our annual property tax last month – over $7300 to educate Juan and Rajeesh’s children.  So proud.

                        Yep. LBJ and W are far more representative of Texas than a stereotype that hasn’t been grounded in reality for more than three generations now. In that way, Texas and Australia remind me of each other although the former, believe it or not, was much closer to the myth until less than two generations ago.

                        3g4me.  That’s because TX has no income tax.  Same happening to AZ.  Owning property therefore puts a target on your back.  As AZ drops down to no income tax—we are about there—the taxes on property begin to rise.
It take $400 per month to open the doors here just for property tax.  These schemes simply shift the burden of taxation onto the more wealthy and relieve the poor even more of any need to consider there choice at the polling station.  (Not that that matters any more in this corrupt State,)

Heh. Come to London, old son. Actually, best not! Nothing struck me more as a mid-twenties man than coming out of a nice pub in West Kensington and seeing how many foreigners there were.
The equation is simple: In the pub = whites; outside the pub = non-whites.

                You are correct, there isn’t a flaw in that assessment of the Texas landscape. Major cities are gonna continue to shine bright blue, perhaps eternal.I grew up in deep East Texas in one of those tiny dot towns where life could still be considered somewhat normal. Even in the 80s and 90s I recall people referring to ‘big city’ ideas whenever it came to the latest progressive liberal dreck.What is interesting to me is how the urban/rural dichotomy seems to repeat itself here in California as well. I live in the central valley area which is filled with dairy farms and livestock ranches. Many small towns with a mostly conservative trend. (mostly, it is still California.) Folks back home still think of California as only being composed of LA or SF, but the reality is that this is a huge state of many different regions.God willing, I plan to move back to a rural area in Texas someday. Even with her faults, she’s still my home.

                    Based on what I have seen, there is absolutely no appetite in Texas to apply the brake to the influx. Other states and regions are going in the other direction.
Still, East Texas might as well be on a different planet than DFW. There is a starker difference between those two than, say, Houston and Boston. Would the state legislature in Austin follow in the steps of the state legislature in Nashville and move to hamstring the city government where it is located? Hell no. This is the state’s problem and seems insoluble.

                    ArthurinCali:  My dearest friend spent far too much money on a mere 2 acres in a small town about 90 miles southeast of DFW, in east Texas.  It definitely has more Texans but is seeing an ever-increasing influx of big-city ‘Texans’ from all over.  The spillover of Whites trying to move just a bit further out from the big cities to stay ahead of the endless parade of following alien parasites has already ruined a lot of formerly small, rural, White areas.  Texas is no exception.

                        Same in Canada. Tons of movement. At this point it’s shuffling chairs on the Titanic.Nothing to do with demographics of course. The smaller cities and towns have some magic dirt. The schools are better there. It also keeps housing costs more affordable.They drive 1h30 to the office each way, but love diversity! No other reasons whey they wouldn’t live in any of the hundreds of closer neighborhoods.It looks something like locusts ravaging a field, whites moving further and further away, being followed by others. They might not even realize why they are moving. But the actions speak quite loud and clear.

                        @B125:“They drive 1h30 to the office each way, but love diversity!”“They might not even realize why they are moving.”Both of those two things cannot be true. They know. They just don’t openly admit it.Here in the States, I’m seeing quite a bit of discomfit among the Ruling Class of late. The vibrant invaders they welcomed are flocking to the urban centers that have generous welfare benefits; they cannot be forced to stay in place and replace local Deplorables as intended. In turn, White urbanites and suburbanites do as you set forth and resegregation occurs. Those mostly White urban Regime dwellers know exactly why they don’t want their leftwing co-ethnics to flee and Juan and Xi to replace them THERE. One of the more interesting aspects of the completely open borders is that unlike in the past, where mostly Mestizo invaders went into East Bumfuck, the Haitians and Nepalese and Syrians now go straight to Chimpcongo.Like all utopian fantasies, this one also will blow up and is indeed doing so even now. Take care of yourself and your own, preferably from a distance, and let it burn on its own accord. It’s all you can do and is the smart thing to do.

“… they cannot be forced to stay in place and replace local Deplorables as intended.”
That reminds me of something I read years ago about a nascent colony of Somalians that *someone* tried to plant in Arizona, but they didn’t want to be there so they all picked up and moved to MN where there was already an established Somalian colony. My first thought was “that’s kinda what the Israelis do in the West Bank …”

        It’s not just America that was protected by physical barriers. Europe west of the Hajnal Line is surrounded on three sides by sea and to east by a sea of land. The Steppe of Central Asia might as well be a sea. It was only breached a couple of times (Huns and Mongols) in more than a thousand years.That protection allowed them to have small competing kingdoms that pushed them to excel. In addition, the reduction in clans allowed them to form larger and larger organizations. It also seemed to create an openness and desire to seek out the new.Of course, the greatest of all of these West Hajnal Line peoples were the English, who were created on an island which protected them even more. They moved themselves to the greatest island of all: North America where their openness and desire to seek the new was perfectly suited. (Australia and NZ were the same.)We’re the result of a thousand year breeding experiment that required physical borders that keep out other, less open tribes. That broke down in the 1960s, and we’re witnessing the result.West European whites will either go through a genetic bottleneck and come out the other side far more ethnocentric and hostile to new ideas and people, or we will be absorbed into other peoples who already have those traits.

            And isn’t the true Spirit of the West all about throwing out trash ideas? We quit groveling before Pharaohs, Shamans and Oriental despots and just focused on the facts with our own minds.
A true innovator throws out a thousand bad ideas for every good one he keeps.  The process of innovation doesn’t work if you can’t throw out the bad. Which is the opposite of openness.  Without discrimination there is no innovation.

            It seems possible that white openness will decrease over time. Mostly thinking about the South, where whites developed a racist system over time as they lived alongside Africans. In a more extreme example, the Boers in South Africa are still living there, and are not known for their openness.At the same time, the pre-1964 whites had the support of their elites to maintain the system. Not sure how average joes are supposed to withstand the onslaught of every single elite, including their own, promoting “anti-racism”.Quebecois are another example, they are quite closed off and even the French Canadian elites are not on board with cultural destruction. They take in too many Haitian immigrants, but far fewer than the rest of Canada, and few Chinese, Indian, and other weirdos. Outside of Montreal the province is close to 100% white.Nature doesn’t care. As you said, we will either be absorbed by groups with those traits, or we will become more closed off. Perhaps both – most becoming mixed with aliens over time, with a smaller group diverging.As a side note, I’m very white, but I’m quite closed off and don’t understand openness. Always have been this way. I remember as a little boy feeling negative thoughts towards what I now realize were outgroups, without even knowing anything about them. My parents were quite liberal.It’s interesting to wonder what happened, how I managed to get my wires crossed. Anyways, our unique traits are most likely a good and useful thing going into the future, although it can be hard knowing too much and seeing everyone else taking the wrong path.

        A wide open continent probably has had an effect on moving and attitudes on newcomers.  But it should be noted that every poll on immigration, at least since the 90s, (when I started paying attention) shows Americans want immigration levels reduced.  Even legal immigration.  Not completely stopped, but reduced.
Our openness has its limits, and a powerful and influential tribe has recognized that, and does everything they can through propaganda and funding to drive that door open further.

        This is a fruitful topic. One of the ironies is that America is becoming less open to ideas in most ways. Bob Whitaker used to say you could be loyal to a people or loyal to a set of words, but not both.We aren’t allowed to question the Narrative on race, sex, equality or immigration. That’s Hate Speech. The left started calling Trump voters ‘traitors’ years ago and they meant it.  Dissent from their Idea of the Moment is treason to them.When they say you must be “open”, they mean you don’t have the right to discriminate. If you can’t discriminate then you’re not free.

                Civil rights law was the Trojan horse. Now it’s a multi-billion dollar a year industry along with billion dollar government agencies. That’s why they will always find new “hate crimes”. Their job depends on it.
Notice libertarians never say anything about it? They talk about pot all the time. But if they wanted to be controversial, why not say a white businessman can hire who he wants and do business with who he wants. If they won’t do that, then shut up about being a libertarians.

        Yes openness is a problem, but for most of its history the US went through cycles of openness followed by periods of closed or tight borders.  Following the 1965 immigration act and the various civil rights laws from the 1960s (and of course the US turning away a few ships of Jewish refugees in WW2), the American people were convinced that any limit on immigration was racist.  Indeed, any preference for their own kind or to preserve the character of their country was racist.The country is doomed but when this mindset changes there is a possibility of building something better in at least parts of the country.  If we focus on what comes next.

        The root of this problem is not the nominal mindset of the citizenry (most people in my experience are extremely opposed to open borders and the invasion of illegals). The root problem is a small number of people who have acquired political power and use it to implement insane and destructive policies, which includes no border enforcement. Many of these “elected” officials were boosted into office via corrupt voting tactics funded by a few wealthy donors who gamed the system (Colorado died such a death via the machinations of just 4 super-rich activists).We cannot solve this problem by focusing on persuasion and hoping that the electorate will “wake up” someday and elected better representatives. At best, that just slows our veer into the ditch and delays the collapse. Better is a fast and soon collapse, onset of the chaos fog, rise of the remedy, and a highly focused implementation. We need to become skilled at tangible arts, not fancy rhetoric exchanged in faux debates. When politicians have actual skin in the game, the insanity will die out one way or the other.

        Openness as originally envisioned back in the Enlightenment was a de facto acknowledgement of the Pareto Principle, which hadn’t been invented yet. “Openness” was supposed to be a sorting mechanism. Thomas Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” was the basic idea; all those “mute inglorious Miltons” and the like… but also “their crimesconfin’d;Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,”Openness gives talent more opportunity to rise, but back then it presupposed a ruling class who would help the (good) talented and suppress the bad talented. It was supposed to be a sorting mechanism, not the be-all, end-all.Alas, as with everything, it became fake and gay, and here we are.

            Whenever it’s brought up by normie I note that “openness” (individualism, etc.) workswithinthe group, but not without.  Again, this is a case where we can borrow a bit from “you know who” as they tolerate all kind of shenanigans within their ranks, but the shields close up to the outside and inside in an effort to keep such shenanigans from destroying the group.Point being, there will be no openness without a group that can protect it, and a group that tolerates it’s own destruction is not a “group” at all, just a collection of misfits on their way out.

        Indeed, and nothing new about it either.

Nobody foresaw the mass dumping of the impoverished, unskilled, and illiterate that happened in the 19th century on the east coast. And that’s how organized crime, anarchism, etc. gained their footing.

        It’s easy to be open in your society when life is hard.  The frontier settlers were a hard bunch who were surrounded by a hostile culture and relied on their own stamina and will to survive in a harsh wilderness.  Such people don’t have the opportunity to be parasites, and if a problem person does come around, they have fast means to take care of them.  A hard life is also grounding.  There’s no talk of egalitarian ideals when every day is a fight for survival.Now, you have NGO’s who will help you get here, give you a place to stay, and teach you how to leech extensive social services.  The reason we are getting parasites is the selection pressure of our country actively encourages it.  Playing by the rules is now a sucker’s game.

            This was exactly my thought upon reading. Sure, the morality of the person may be in question, but the actual fortitude required to make an odyssey (whether into the West or New World) demonstrated a strength of character and resolve, certainly admirable traits. Contrast this with the current day enabling.

        The last thing that utterly closing the border brings to my mind is shame and guilt.  Not only do I want the border closed – with a twenty foot tall wall topped with razor wire, a 500 yard wide minefield belt and machine gun towers every two hundred yards – but every single legal and illegal alien in the past twenty years minimum, ejected back whenever their s***skins came from.  And everyone who championed and allowed this invasion will be dropped into the minefield for public entertainment.

        “Americans would rather die than be mean to newcomers”
Maybe a more brutal way to put it is: Americans would rather kill their own children than be mean to newcomers.  Because that’s what they’re doing.

            The biggest humiliation are the parents whose kids are murdered by illegals, who then go on TV to proclaim how not racist they are.  Unfortunately, modern Christianity has a lot of blame for this mindset.
If you think Christ is going to commend you for not being racist when an invader kills your child, you might be in for a shock.

                    Marko:  Hadn’t seen that but am not in the least surprised.  Almost every Texas church of any denomination offers a service in Spanish and/or free English lessons.   The deep-seated notion that to be against open borders is anti-Christian is poison.  Always backed up with the “Jesus was a refugee in Egypt” cant.

            A friend whose husband is an electrician was performing a side job in a small community a bit  ago. He was in his personal truck and had pulled over to the side of the road to answer a call from his wife. One of the men from the community stopped to ask if he needed anything and  made a comment about the fact that he and his truck were unfamiliar to him. My friend was really irritated and thought it was rude of the guy to have done. Her husband wasn’t bothered in the least, of course.If only we had more people with that mentality, with the desire to protect their communities and their people. How different things might be.

        “Now that the world is much more crowded and oceans are no longer a barrier, openness is a liability.”F. J. Turner’s frontier thesis worked fine until the real estate ran out; what’s often neglected are his thoughts on sectionalism, an idea whose time, like the rough beast impelling it, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born.
