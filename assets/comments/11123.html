        I had a brilliant, easily bored younger cousin who got an accounting degree, went to work for GM corporate, got a Harvard masters on GM’s dime, got bored with GM corporate, went to work as a prof at U. Nebraska, got bored with that, and then, 20 years after college, bought a truck and did long haul trucking for the next 40+ years until he died a couple of years ago. He loved being a trucker and couldn’t care less about things of the mind or getting rich.

            I salute your younger cousin. He figured it out, the way Eric Hoffer did. It takes an uncommon mind to choose to be “common”.

            In tech people believe they are “changing the world.”  Pretty obviously, they are not changing it for the better.  When you realized skilled heavy equipment operators make $50/hr and don’t deal with all of the SJW/gay/Hindu/HR nonsense, life as a commoner starts to look real attractive.  The people aren’t as smart, but they have families.  They might do drugs and have tattoos, but they know what sex they are.

                *Some* people in tech – ARE changing the world.  But they are the elite troops that Zman referred to.  They are a small subset of the total population of people working in tech – and they punch way above their weight in the overall picture of things as far as how much singular people have a long lasting effect in the products and services you see coming out of the tech sector.I have worked in startup and small companies pretty much since I graduated from college 30 years ago.  Well I did until 2007 – when the startup company I worked for got bought up by a well known very large tech company.   Going thru that experience was illuminating as far as watching the changes over the years going from what was a company with 50 people when I started – to working in a company that has something 140k employees now.Zman is correct – in the early days, as an employee you were expected to WORK.  We had no SJW crap going on , no diversity training, no kumbaya BS.  Screwup – and you got told so – directly.  Do a good job – and there was congratulatory blow job either – because it was expected.One of the more interesting things that happened along the way – occurred shortly after that original startup Co. was acquired by the big tech company.  By this time I had been there for four years – we had grown constantly and were on the path to success even without being acquired.  As most startups will do – you got stock options.  It was pretty clear that people who had been there for a while (being early means more options than coming in later) – were going to make out quite nicely.But………..  sitting in a large group of people one day eating lunch in the cafeteria,  a couple of younger engineer types – who had only come into the company less than year before the acquisition became known (might have only been 6 months or so) – were bitching up a storm about how it was “unfair” that the people who had been there early – had gotten more stock options and were therefore going to make so much more money than all the Johnny come lately’s stood to make.There was more than one of this young twats who seemed to share this attitude – and say it was “interesting” because it was another one of those incidents I have had with liberal leaning types – who have a DEFINITE ingrained entitlement attitude.   The concept of work and reward are completely foreign to them.One of the things that was nice about working at the company at that point – is we were still being run by the original startup management – so it was entirely acceptable to give them a dressing down right there in front of everybody – and not have to worry about getting called to HR office for hurting somebody’s feelings.  My basic response to them was :” Go eff yourself,  the reason why the people who have been here longer made more money – is because they did the damn work.  Without them – YOU WOULDN’T EVEN BE HERE.  I highly doubt you would have even applied for a job here in the early days.  You came to work here when it was plainly clear the company was going somewhere. You  know what one of the founders said to me on the day I was interviewed?  They said – we might be out of money in April (it was October) – how do you feel about that?  I said:  I guess I get to work for a few months and then I’ll have to look for another job.  You’re like those people who come into an interview and the first things on their mind is how much vacation do they get – and how long is the workday – and they’re stupid enough to actually ask the question seriously.   I didn’t take a vacation longer than two days for 3 years.  I spent one period of 7 months working 80 hours  a week.  Stop your whining. The person who was leading the engineering group was working so many hours his body was falling apart and he was literally shitting himself at work. The people who were here all those early years made the money because THEY DESERVED IT ”I still work there – I’ve been there almost 14 years.  A work day now is barely 8 hours.  There’s emails every week from the corporate diversity officer – and mandatory training with more and more SJW content every year.  They can’t seem to get their shit straight and develop new products without spending 3 times the amount of money the startup company I started at did to develop a new product .   It’s ridiculous – but mildly amusing.  With the right attitude it’s also far less stress – and time consumed from my life – than working for a startup company.But there is no esprit de corp – and there is little sense of accomplishment.  It’s a paycheck.  And that is what most people in the world will go for – because it’s easy.  Landing first on the beach is hard – and a lot of people get killed.

        A Renaissance followed the first Dark Age, as we all recall. The current Dark Age formally descended in the Sixties and we already can see dawn breaking. In fact, the actual resistance is our side simply awakening; Progressivism has degenerated into cannibalism and largely exists now to eat its own as often as others in freakish rituals only the mentally retarded and mentally insane tolerate let alone relish. You actually made a recent blog point on this very point.The Dissident Right is winning largely because the cucks and cultural Marxists are imploding. It took a long time to get here, and may take a long time to get out (or not; things are moving at a rapid pace in our direction). Optimism doesn’t come naturally after at least two, and arguably five, generations of successive defeats. Optimism, though, is warranted now and may have to be re-learned.All the people I respect in the Dissident Right take the “We Are Doomed” approach, understandably, so that will be a hard default position to abandon. It is for me, too, just to be clear, but it is time for us to throw off the often self-imposed shackles that placed on us. Let the Left’s nihilism consume it and focus on what we can do to fill its void as quickly as possible.

            Athens fell. Rome fell. The Black Death wiped out medieval Europe.
What came after from the ruins was smarter, stronger, faster.
Unless the collapse of Western Civ, SJW-ruled version, takes out EVERYONE, down to the last biker gang and Marine fireteam … we’ll be back.
Of course, it would be nicer if we didn’t have to fall all the way first. Which is what we’re trying with Trump.

            Rule by the Modern Left, if left to fructify on its own, will look like the sacrificial temple scenes in Gibson’s ‘Apocalyto’, rather than the stolid gray people in the front row of Radford’s ‘1984’.

                It would, and human sacrifice has been the hallmark of left-wing totalitarianism. The note of semi-optimism struck above is due to people awakening in a somewhat timely manner before mass casualties occur. The global utopianism that replaced Marxism may yet end in fire and blood, but it isn’t a given any longer. We weren’t able to say that as recently as three years ago.

            You may be right Jack, but I cannot share your optimism. We don’t have much time, the demographics are changing rapidly. Trump just a bump in the road to decline or is real change coming?

                Widespread awareness of anti-white racism, coupled with almost universal dismissal of the propaganda organs as reliable sources of information, are quite real and represent vital moves in the right direction.  Time is indeed short, but real change is happening now. Will it be too late? No one can say with certainty but it wasn’t very long ago we all assumed it was. My optimism is tempered but the fatalism is long gone now.

                    Pessimism? Yes. Fatalism? No. Both major parties support population replacement immigration policies. Trump just came up with a new immigration plan.  Will it become law? I don’t think so.

        “……While it is entertaining, these orgies of destruction are killing Western civilization….”Is true, then who/what will take its place?IMHO it will be the Chinese.They don’t F around taking rubbish courses in college like women’s/black/hispanic/LGBT (hate) studies, sociology, psych,  communications, leadership (what the F is leadership studies?), etc.They study engineering, medicine, business, finance, science, math, etc., you know, real stuff.And they are not into this crap about diversity, safe spaces, correcting injustices committed by their great-great grandparents, or racial/ethnic set-asides to help some “exploited” group from shooting up their neighborhood and beating up their school teachers.Nope, they just put their noses to the grindstone and work.That’s why here in the USA, Chinese (and Japanese) Americans are at the top of the socio-economic ladder.China may have a govt. that we may think is oppressive, but they aim to become a global power; and they have the smarts to do it. It is this latter point that gives them the edge.Couple that with the liberal-progressive suicidal leaders here in the USA and in Europe and bingo, it’s all over for Western Civ.

            The main problem China has going forward is that no sane person actually wants to live there.  The air will kill you and there are proles fucking everywhere.  They have more millionaires than any country in the world, and every one of them has a plan to leave China for a foreign country that is actually a nice place to live.

        Having personally participated in just such a corporate collapse as Z Man describes, I can personally vouch for his insights.  In my case, when I met my new colleague whom my sociopathic supervisor was extolling, I knew that it was time to ‘stand up, hook up’ and jump out the door the next time an employee buy-out package green light came on.  She was not only an minority and an esteemed former employee of the local NOW organization, but she was a lawyer to boot_!Talk about a new hire whose resume screamed out prepackaged trouble_! Her likely potential for disruption was apparently invisible to the bosses_!   As Z Man says, letting her inside the door at all was demonstration enough of their sycophantic incompetence.*But if one cares to look at it systematically, SJW convergence works to accelerate the stasis and decay portion of the corporate life cycle.  The slow-to-learn corporations are culled from the heard even faster now: Darwin rules_!IOW, in the old days of lifetime employment (which I benefitted from the twilight of) successful corporations eventually became sloppy, larded up with retired-in-place VP’s + their ex-mistresses and golfing buddies.  It was my hope to become one myself in my golden years (except for golf and mistresses). Anyway, was a process taking many years.  Sadly for sloppy firms, it was Michael Milliken’s insight in the mid ’80’s that he could buy-out sloppily managed firms using junk bond financing and then quickly free up enough cash flow to service that debt by playing Dirty Harry down mahogany row.  Each VP or director he plugged was easily worth at least $500k  – $1 mil./year in debt service because he was able to take out the entire drone constellation shortly thereafter.With SJW convergence that process happens organically and rapidly.  No need to extend the agony over decades of futilely attempted renewal such as I naively hoped our suffering would bring about.  We were ignorant of the new dispensation demanding the destruction of cis-het-priviledge provided economic value.*In this one particular case, it turned out well.  She was actually wanting to start her family (and her husband_(?!) was insisting on this – Asian doc).  She knew that NOW would have been a completely toxic environment for same.  But she couldn’t tell anybody, our place or theirs.  After the mom hormones kicked in, particularly after the birth of their son, she actually became pleasant to be around.  Eventually she became a stay-at-home mom.  Amazing_!

            It was a good run, though. Imagine what it was like to be an Athenian in (say) the first century of our era, scraping out a living selling tourist baubles to rich Roman tourists, sucking the last juice from their glorious tradition. It must have been humiliating.So it will go with us; fifty years from now we’ll be wearing cowboy hats or Indian headresses and having fake gun battles to please the Chinese plutocrats come to see the “authentic America”.We’re not there just yet. We may not be able to create anything of value, but we can still blow up stuff. And we produce tip-top porn. 25th century archaeologists will discover our rusted old ICBM silos and a sampler of old porn dvds and rate us where we belong on the scale of civilized life.

                It’s not at all clear that our ICBMs work.  I don’t think we still know how to do nuclear testing.  The men who knew how to do it died.  Just as we’ve retreated from space, I think we’re retreating from the atomic age.

                    Rick Perry is currently in charge of making sure our ICBMs work, over at Energy. It’s kind of funny how the media ignores him in the same way they ignore waiters and maids. I doubt we will hear much fanfare about what he is doing, but there are hints in his focus on technology updates, technology security including cyber security (he forced the VA to turn over their hacked computer system and use Energy’s system – which Energy will maintain. A tiny public-facing event that hints of vast moves in the background), &amp; in the militant language that he and President Trump use when speaking about American energy.  Before he leaves, I feel pretty confident we’ll have a good solid nuclear system again.

                    Yes!!  In my work (for the Govt) I spend my days talking to veterans 85 to 100 years old — capturing their stories, military and non.  Recently, by chance, I interviewed two men who spent their post-military careers in the aerospace / nuclear fields.  Neither had graduated college; one had not finished high school, the other went to an aeronautical design school in SoCal before the war.  Both were deeply involved in some of our nation’s biggest projects, among which were design, building, installation and testing of our ICBM capability.  They also worked across numerous aviation and space programs from the 50s through the 70s.  In talking to men like this, one can see they are the same as us … externally.  yet there is some tangible difference.  They understood the seriousness of life, and how to distinguish what was really important.Certainly, they had the same human flaws as have existed throughout time (though I’m not sure those “flaws” would have been identified as such outside of a traditional western context).  But they generally exhibit no sign of having been infected by what we call the LEFT early in their lives.  There is a toughness to them — a no-nonsense feel — that I do not get so clearly and broadly from younger Vets (Vietnam and later), and that I did not see personally in my own soldiers and colleagues during the last years of my 30-plus term of military service.  They had little original sense of entitlement (though that was instilled in many post-war).  They expected little, and were content with what they did accomplish.  They were hard, knew their jobs, and expected others to be the same — or those non-performers in such critical realms as aerospace and weapons design were gone.And they generally appreciate our nation, even love it still.  As one old WWII 101 vet told me some years before I retired — a vet whose father immigrated from Italy before WWI:  “If this country isn’t worth dying for, what is?”  Not sure he’d say that now.I talk with dying old men who flew 25+ bombing missions over occupied France and Germany (to include Dresden, Berlin, Koln ad the like), or who made the 18-plus hour run from the Marianas to Japan and back.  They tell me of taking off the end of Guam North field, dropping at full power nearly to the water to get sufficient lift to begin the long clawing flight up to their cruise altitude, of suffering damage over target, and having to crash land on iwo Jima.  I hear about the fights on Biak,Iwo Jima and Okinawa from men who saw it as riflemen, and who were crippled for life during their time there.  I’ve spoken to men badly wounded on Italy, or put into the water off Norway when their merchant ship was sunk.  And from all of this men, there are a couple of things I hear:  Toughness and a sense of duty; a willingness to sacrifice (not happiness to do so), and no regret for what they did or suffered.  And a quiet pride in knowing their job, and in doing it well.Whatever qualities and circumstances defined and produced men such as this have faded so from our society, or are completely absent.  I saw the degradation in the military, as “diversity took over as the primary GOOD, and I see it now — every day — in the govt agency in which I currently work.So yes, it’s no stretch to think that our nuclear arsenal is no so ready, or well understood as it was in prior decades.  We heard this some decade or more back, when the Air Force was taken to task for it’s poor job of maintaining the nuclear inventory.And NO, I don’t condemn all in our military as being of this unserious stripe.  I think this last war proved we still cultivate those qualities in our population.  However, that cultivation happens against a great force working to stamp it out, and it happens not in our cities, cultural institutions and educational system.  Rather, it happens at the margins — in that broad and shallow coating of red that covers the lesser-populated areas of our nation.

The best estimate is that around 3000 death sentences were carried out in Spain by Inquisitorial verdict between 1550 and 1800, a far smaller number than that in comparable secular courts.But, for some inexplicable reason those (((who control discourse in America))) have us answer Torquemada when the punishment bell is being rung.

        When I was a young man, I was taught to think about political movements or new ideologies in terms of the military. The guys who start the movement, or pioneer a new ideology, are analogous to the elite units sent in to establish a beachhead or breech the perimeter. These guys are goal oriented and never bogged down with a lot of rules. In fact, they tend to hate the rules as they see rules as artificial obstacles to their task. In their pursuit of power, the pioneers often start out trying to subvert the rules.

        In regards to the fox news scandal:  The far right broadcasters and executives just cannot seem to escape being some of the sleeziest, sexual harrassment men on the planet. I wonder if the Evangelical, Christian, CONservatives will be as outraged by the actions of Eric Bolling as they claimed to be about those of Anthony Weiner? Maybe we can start making “balling’ jokes in honor of this man’s name like the RIGHT did with Weiner’s.In regards to google screed: fascists love to use the term “ideological diversity”.  Sorry snowflake, being a misogynist doesn’t make you special. Just sad. We are witnessing the end of white male privilege. This terrifies mediocre white men and they are going to lash out in their death throes.

            One appreciates your sincerity, Mr. Denton. Your problem is your argument — you don’t have one. You paint in very broad stokes and reveal an impoverished and sterile mind. In fairness, you may be 12 and are just getting started on the long voyage of sorting out your ideas. We’ve all had to make this journey. We older people have the advantage of getting through this “middle passage” before exposing our feeble understanding on the internet. Our bleak attempts to say something useful or interesting at 12 or 15 are lost in the mists of pre-internet society.Just for your own improvement: Consider the possibility that you might be overloooking something; we call this humility, on our team. It’s what makes us the good guys in this death struggle.

                    He’s probably Hasbra or a paid troll. Used to come bother people at Vox Day’s blog under the name Tiny Duck among others.
The only way you’ll be rid of him is to ban him.

            I’d say the mediocre white men (e.g. Pajama Boy) are all on the Left. As the legendary cultural anthropologist Margaret Meade once observed: “Women want mediocre men, and men are working hard to become as mediocre as possible”. Or, to put it in more contemporary terms, “as feminine as possible”.I often wonder if the seemingly incongruous and illogical attraction that Lefties and especially Feminist Lefties have for medieval-minded Islamic terrorists is not simply a Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name, a Freudian libido for real, masculine men, masquerading as ethnic/racial cosmopolitanism…

                As long ago as 1983, Walker Percy reported in his ‘Lost in the Cosmos’ that surveys showed that the most common fantasy among American women was to fornicate with two strange men at once.
My own guess: Having de-balled the native male stock, American women look now, with langorous eyes, at the tawny and ruthless imports, and feel a heightened ‘je ne sais quoi’ as they shower and water their plants.

                Even as early as the ’60’s, it was known inside the field of study that Margaret Mead was the early feminist version of Sigmond Freud: Concocting convoluted theories from invented data that explicated and attempted to normalize their respective sexual depravities.

                        Short answer, don’t know.  There are suggestions in her bio, though.  Her reported conduct (i.e. gossip) not observed by me was that she aspired to live like her mythical Polynesian Princesses that had many Polynesian stud lovers at their command at all times.  These being in short supply in NY City in the ’30’s – ’60’s she had to make do with male grad students.

                The great majority of lefties with which I once engaged in normal conversation confidently self-identified as moderates. This shocked me at first, of course. A total lack of self-awareness lends to a general lack of awareness. But just as Tiny Duck would reject the truth that Hannity, Limbaugh, and Levin are moderates, so too would that truth not occur to those poor lost boys either. You could fit all the right wingers in the country into Rhode Island. Maybe that’s an idea.
