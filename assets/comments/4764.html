        Uber is obviously illegal. Airbnb isn’t quite as obviously illegal, but would have to skirt a lot of regulations on operating an inn.
Generally the elites get away with disobeying laws they don’t find convenient, which is why maybe investing in these companies wasn’t totally stupid, but there is a limit to what you can get away with.

        I’m sensitive to the abuse of the “independent contractor” status rife in Silicon Valley. I trained briefly with a company called “Magic” that demanded full-time in-office work from its army of “independent contractors” who were OBVIOUSLY employees in every sense of the term save the strict, legal one.
But in this case, Uber drivers really are more like independent contractors, making their own hours and operating their own vehicles.
In any case, interesting to see how this will play out.

        Many years ago I was teaching civil/sanitary engineering, and I had a colleague in construction management that strongly advocated that construction companies classify as many employers as possible as self-employed contractors. This was deliberately intended to transfer all sorts of costs (FICA, health insurance, liability insurance, workers comp, etc etc) to the “contractor.” The scheme has spread far and wide. Uber is merely an obvious example.

            Good. Why do you assume that the multi-generational accumulation of socialist debris is a good thing? This country is dying, and not due to a failure to respect FICA, but because it does.

        If the Uberlike companies can destroy the cab-government cartel entirely, a swell thought, then they won’t any longer be taking advantage of existing parasitical arrangements will they? Destroying them is the bonus. You are a statist or you are not.
