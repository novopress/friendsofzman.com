        way too many assumptions.  like obama got into Harvard.  do you know his marks.  and are they legit, since nothing about him is legit how can you make such a statement.
obama is not smarter then palin in my estimation.  he is a con artist, clever but NOT smart. inarticulate and basically a fraud that is supported by fellow travelers.
