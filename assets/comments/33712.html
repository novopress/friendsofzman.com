            Surely no World Bank-funded German NGO would lie about Russia. There’s nothing suspicious about their exclusion of Russian data from several of their most heavily weighted measures, considering such data prima facie “invalid” because…it doesn’t match their corruption ranking for Russia. None shall look askance at Ukraine’s place on the list, which has notably improved since the war began. Nor has one any cause think that—
I should cut this comment short, lest it become a conspiracist fever swamp.

        The Sentencing Council could save themselves some time at the office by simply designating “all non-white people” as the “victims” of “disparate impact”. In another 20-30 years, the SCs enemy (white native-born Christians) will qualify as the very minority they are “protecting” under the current language, and we can’t be having that – not in the Britain of today, the unfortunate peoples under the thumb of Keir Starmer.

        If you do a google search for “Brunswick Three” you’ll see nothing about the case in the first three pages of results, until you get to an AP story on page 4. However, if you do a Bing search, you’ll get two results from the Unz Review on page 1, including the 2nd overall result. I suppose that’s progress.

            Jigger the lyrics of Dylan’s “Hurricane” to fit the Brunswick Three case, and you have yourself an anthem of resistance to our oppressors.

        As you can probably tell, I’m a major Dylan fan to this dayhe was still big in my gen, gen x. I saw him with my dad and best friend when I was maybe 12 or 13 touring with ge smith. TBH, I don’t remember the concert being very good; but I guess he is hit or miss live. I always thought his love songs were the best: girl from north country, farewell Angelina, ; his political stuff was too overt. If I’m not mistaken he even tried to make atheism folksy with that hezachia sobghe was good at clever artsy  phrases that sounded poetic but as a whole, I never thought his songs made much sense.

                I’ll allow for the possibility that it sounded better in the context of its own times. Maybe you had to be there. But 60 years later it mostly sounds like poo. And politics cheapens music horribly.

                    I cannot recall a single Dylan song that was overtly “political”. People assume that because The Sixties were “political” and that Dylan was in the vanguard of Sixties Music, that he was somehow leading protests and forging slogans. Pete Seeger, of course, was a communist asshole; so much so his old partner, Burl Ives, broke with him. That the early Dylan adopted a “Seeger sound” wasn’t due to a political attitude so much as a musical affinity that fit Dylan’s talents when he was young.We here on the self-styled DR should salute Dylan for his line, “even the President of the United States must sometimes have to stand naked”. Is that political?**I lost a good friend when I asked her if Hillary Clinton grunts when she takes a sh*t, as ordinary people often do.

Chat GPT does not agree:
Did Bob Dylan sing any political songs?
Absolutely! Bob Dylan is renowned for his politically charged and socially conscious songs. Tracks like“Blowin’ in the Wind”and“The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;”became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements. Other notable songs include“Masters of War”, which critiques the military-industrial complex, and“Only a Pawn in Their Game”, addressing racial injustice. His music has inspired generations to reflect on societal issues and push for change.

                    Is it the supposed politics you don’t like, or the melodies, or what? “Poo” isn’t very helpful. If music that is sixty years old is “poo”, then God only knows how offensive Mozart’s “music” must be to you.

                        Sorry, replying to myself. Listen to “Pleasant Valley Sunday” by the Monkees. Now THAT is “political”. Lampooning the suburbs, just like Seeger did with “Little Boxes”.

            Dylan himself didn’t often take his lyrics seriously. One of my favorites, “Ballad of a Thin Man” is really just free association goofiness, but it’s a great song and the refrain “you know something’s happening, but you don’t know what it is, do you, Mister Jones?” – whether intentionally or not – captures the image of the go along to get along minor bureaucrat, pencil in his hand, confused by changes. One wonders ifFalling Downwasn’t somehow inspired by this song. I hope so.Like Derb, I love Dylan’s music, at any rate up to 1976. They said he couldn’t sing, then he puts outNashville Skylinein 1969, with “Lay Lady Lay” and “Tonight I’ll be Staying Here with You”, among other gems. He sings beautifully on these songs. Johnny Cash joined him on a duet, singing “Girl of the North Country” and it isn’t Dylan who ruins the harmonies, but Cash.His last – to my taste – “classic” album isDesire. I first heard ‘Black Diamond Bay’, the tale of a woman, a volcano, and a panama hat, when I was sixteen. True, that album included the regrettable ‘Hurricane’ which had a lot of FM airplay at the time, bemoaning the “racist” murder conviction of “Hurricane” Carter.* Pity, because it is one hell of a song, with its driving strings, tight drumming and righteous (sounding) anger. Take the same song and make it about the Brunswick 3, and you’ve got yourself a dissidentpiece de resistance.My favorite all-time Dylan recording (except for a few others, if you know what I mean) is ‘Sarah’, also onDesire. An emotional masterpiece which, I understand, is about his wife and their failing relationship. Comparable in every way to Gordon Lightfoot’s “If You Could Read My Mind” as a song of despair over a failed marriage. A beautiful, thoughtful, masterful recording. You’ll never hear it on the radio and I doubt he ever performed it in concert these last decades, but it is among his very best.Finally,Bringing All Back Home, from 1965, what with ‘Gates of Eden’, “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue” and the incredible “It’s Alright Ma”, is a personal favorite. I heard it in 1974 when I was thirteen; a year later when I had a newspaper delivery route and had the jack to buy real albums, I snaggedBefore the Flood, a two-disc live album Dylan recorded with The Band.As it happens, a neighbor of mine grew up in Hibbing MN two years ahead of Bob Zimmermann in school. She remembers him, vaguely, as a weird, autistic kid with a goofy haircut. No one paid much attention to him at the time.*My daughter caught the Dylan bug from me; she wrote a paper in high school on the actual facts of the Hurricane Carter case, showing that Carter, far from being either (a) innocent or (b) a serious prizefighting contender, was in fact a punk who in all likelihood was involved in the killing.
