        “You did imply that. A quote from your original comment, ” Is it the child in the financially stable, two parent family or is it the child of a young, financially unstable single parent?”
“Race” is debatable but “ethnicity” is not.

        If I had it to do over again I would study genetics, a fascinating subject.  Language will have to do here, but the word “race” is an old English word meaning “stream.”
Different cultures, different biologies come down through the generations in different streams.  Those who claim race, at least in the stream context, doesn’t exist are pretending.

        Denmark is filling up with Muslims who are not integrating into Danish society and are openly striving to impose sharia law on Denmark.  These days there are more Danes living abroad than live in Denmark itself.  Danish society and culture are under siege, the Danes know it, but they don’t know what to do about it.

        A few years ago the happiest country on the planet was reported to be Bhutan.  Some speculated that this was because Bhutan keeps itself relatively cut off from the outside world, though that has changed significantly with the internet.
Others speculated that Buddhism had a role to play.
Anyway, I’ve been there and its very beautiful and the people are very gracious and friendly.
Great place to raise a family.

        Not utterly full of Danes anymore:“Many of the remaining 10.4% are immigrants—or descendants of recent immigrants—that came mainly from Turkey, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Asia and the Middle East. Of the 10.4%, approximately 200,000 (34%) are of a Western background, and approx. 390,000 (66%) have a non-Western background.[132]”“Denmark’s Muslims make up approximately 3% of the population and form the country’s second largest religious community and largest minority religion.[140][145] As of 2009 there are nineteen recognised Muslim communities in Denmark.[145][146] As per an overview of various religions and denominations by the Danish Foreign Ministry, other religious groups comprise less than 1% of the population individually and approximately 2% when taken all together.[147]”And then there’s all those little Lego men and women.
