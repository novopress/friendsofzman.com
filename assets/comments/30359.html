        Apologies if someone has already made this point, but maybe being fixated on “the future,” having a “vision of the future,” etc, etc, is part of the problem.  Was anyone really concerned with “the future” as a political end prior to the French Revolution?

        Nostalgia is a billion dollar industry yearly. I’m aware of it and engage in it daily mentally and monetarily with and without knowing I’m participating in it. My wife wants to go to the island of Manhattan this year, I haven’t been back in 22 years after living there for the fist couple of decades of my life .People like to go see the house they lived in, the school they dropped out of, the restaurants they loved. I haven’t made up my mind yet, I’m thinking it would be like going to a wake, rather unsettling and sad. Just getting to the airport and having a plane actually be there when we arrive and get us back on time is a crapshoot not to mention every house in every neighborhood is now Korean or Chinese. I think I’ve answered my question .

            Yup.
Tons of money in things like classic cars, baseball cards, and vinyl records.
Ironically, I currently have a lady friend that wants to visit Manhattan from overseas.
Somehow I don’t have the heart to tell her that it ain’t like TV and that blowing her savings on this trip is a terrible idea.

        “For a culture that has no future, the present represents the terrifying final step into the abyss, so the only option is to turn to the past and find comfort in reliving it.”This is why I’m convinced Apple’s AR set will be a smash hit. Too many people unable to deal with the brutality of reality as Western Civilization collapses.People will push further into escapism, into safety in an imaginary world, whether provided by Apple or some demagogue promising a better future in the afterlife.It’s truly beautiful to watch. To see reality and Nature finally push through and push the weak into the fantasy lands they belong.On another positive note, the barbarian types don’t know what to do without Whites to taunt. Most likely just as they invaded Western Civilization, they too will eventually push into artificial realms to harass people.The parasites upon Nature are being expelled.The parasites upon the parasites will follow suit.And thus the meek shall inherit the Earth.

        “This is not surprising, given the conservative habit of following the Left from one fad to the next.”
There’s going to come a time when the Left comes mass suicide – in fact, it’s already in progress with the climate change hysteria, push for childlessness and euthanasia.
The Right, always worried they’re not accepted by the cool kids, will follow pursuit.
* Population reduction* “You will own nothing and you will be happy”
Watch the Right stab each other in the back to promote these points.
When it happens, I can’t say anything of value will be the lost.

        Any time I see an online rant against those evil commies, I know the poster is over 40 years old.  No one under that age gives a rat’s ass about the communist Boogeyman.

                I wish that was true. Far as I can tell, the younger folks have redefined (or had redefined for them) fascism as anyone who isn’t onboard with critical race theory or trannyism. And they care about that kind of “fascism” very much.

            I’ll add that if someone younger than a Boomer is blaming communism, cultural marxism, or bioleninism, it is likely that they are trying to conceal the racial aspects of our predicament.

I’ve always thought race is a key component of bioleninism as it is constituted in the West.
Have I missed something in Spandrell’s essays on this topic?

            Well, that’s amnesia for you, forgetting the lessons of what a drag autocratic societies invariably are. A healthy society is based on what is essential, and not chasing one idiot latest thang after another, none of which have anything to do with those beliefs or practices essential to a life lived well. Too bad about those ahistorical morons, but those who forget the lessons of history and the verities of human nature that underlie them are doomed to revisit them. Maybe your apparent scorn for those who try to be situationally aware about those pitfalls is somewhat misplaced.

            My wife has become right-curious since the covid nonsense. I don’t talk about politics unless I’m drunk and she pesters me about it. I’m not sure what normie conservative/libertarian types talk about anymore—what could they possibly have to say?—but they must still mention Marx a lot, because she recently asked me what to read to learn about his philosophy. I dug out the ol’ Grundrisse and said something like, “This is it. You’ve never heard a single thing that’s in here. Nobody’s a Marxist.” If she reads it she’ll believe me, but it’s very long and boring, and the guys in her earphones are still gonna MARX MARX MARX at her like Reaganite chihuahuas while she’s gardening.

        As someone who is politically bipolar i’ve always felt that the democratic party is being discriminated against.
The obstacles that democrats have to control the Senate state legislatures the supreme court etc when compared to republicans is never mentioned.
So there’s sort of a view I’ve had that you can gerrymander us out of office or take our court seats away but eventually we’ll be back and stronger than ever.

        Actually, sometimes you can go backwards. The reason everyone considers the 50’s the “golden age of America,” is because there was peace and tranquility by and large, and economic prosperity. Before all this forced integration crap, whites lived in suburbia and rural areas mostly free of interaction with blacks, who were limited to their own neighborhoods “ghetto’s. A man didn’t go to work and have to deal with blacks, he didn’t come home and have a drink sitting on his front porch and watch blacks let their property turn to ruble, or cars pulling up every ten minutes to score some drugs. He didn’t have to worry about his wife being raped, his house being broken into, or his lawnmower being stolen. White kids didn’t have to deal with black thuggery in school, or having the curriculum dumbed down to accommodate black low IQ.You also didn’t have an invading hoard from south of the border displacing whites in jobs, their neighborhoods, and the tax burden of augmenting their low income with welfare, food stamps, medicaid, or section 8 housing. Or footing the bill for them outright.Women were mostly married, at home  cranking out kids, and baking cookies, Not at the office bitching and complaining all day and disrupting the work environment with demands for accommodating them and implementing their anti productive “pie in the sky policies,” creating non stop petty drama, if not outright grifting, “getting a paycheck for contributing nothing of value.Whites don’t want to deal with blacks or have them around for obvious reasons. Blacks don’t want to deal with whites or be around them either, except… where it benefits them financially. Like white women baby momma’s having kids with black men and shacking up with them in white neighborhoods white productive whites foot the bill, and watch their neighborhoods and housing values go to shit.It’s like the guy who’s busting his ass and he stops and takes a look around and sees everyone else leaning on a shovel, smoking a cigarette and shooting the shit. Eventually he says enough, I’m not working my ass off to make things happen while everyone else f’s off and gets the same pay.All of these create tension and resentment. So the producers “white men,” are saying “screw it,” and basically going Gault. So you have what we have now, decay everywhere you look, and a societal “powder keg,” ready to blow at any second.No we can’t back to driving ‘57 Chevy’s and our kids playing with hoola hoops. But we can go back to what works and will always work, because human nature is and always will be human nature!

Cuba has 57 Chevys.  Why can’t we?  Sure we could.

Who is Mayorkas to flood our country; who ‘s Noodleman to confiscate our wealth into arms for Zelensky?  Or for that mid east terrorist hive?

                        Xers, at least, are keeping 70’s, 80’s 90’s  “pre digital” polluters on the road.
Me, a ’93 W140…ayuh…took a 90 y.o. girlfriend  (neighbor) to see an exraordinary Jazz Trio in Stamford, NY just yesterday; over the hills south of Central New York, and down into the head of the Delaware Valley.
(Old girl was like “I KNEW you were a classy cat, but I didn’t know just HOW classy…” ; -)

            I have anemoia for the 70s. Better music and movies than the 50s. At the same time there was a much more libertine attitude as political correctness hadn’t taken hold.
For those that were alive then, how accurate were movies like “Detroit Rock City” or “dazed and confused”?

                As a kid of the 70’s I agree to a point. Without the culture of the 50’s, we don’t get to the cool shit of the 70’s or even my favorite era the 80’s. Give me some Van Halen, a cool 70’s Muscle car, and Fast Times at Ridgemont high, or Back to the future.
Like you I was a teenager in the 80’s, and it was a very whimsical, up beat, happy time for all.
Nihilism and pessimism were virtually non existent. Look at us now.

        I prefer Hiraeth to the neologism anemoia.  Per Feinfach.com, “It’s often described as nostalgia or a deep longing for a place or time that may never have existed, or that may have existed only in one’s memories or imagination. It brings together the feelings of homesickness, nostalgia and longing. Hiraeth is a pull on the heart that conveys a distinct feeling of missing something irretrievably lost. The word has a complex and nuanced meaning and is an important part of Welsh culture and identity.”  Used in English untranslated.

            It’s a very good word, hiraeth.
It’s kind of like the definition of the Holy Roman Empire as the kingdom that never was but always is. It is an expression of the ideal that reigns eternally in the heart; and even though it won’t be fully realized this side of Heaven, it ever there to lead and guide us.

            Anemoia: “Nostalgia for a time or a place one has never known.”
Is there anyone here who wishes to argue [or declare] that our memories of that time and place [the Reagan Administration of 1981-1989] are FALSE?!?!?

        If, back in the late 1960s, you had wanted to get an idea of the shape of the future (which is not the same thing as predicting the future, nobody can do that), and in doing so you had looked at the younger generations at that time and extrapolated their “ethos” out fifty or sixty years into the future, you probably wouldn’t have done so poorly at picturing the present day, relative to other would be future seers anyway.So when I think about the future, I disregard Boomers and Xers and look at Gen Z, Millennials, the firehose of incoming vibrancy, and the trend of relentlessly declining birthrates/fertility. Do I really need to say anything else? Man, it is ugly. Never mind all the hifalutin ideals. We will be fortunate just to have basic services.On the bright side, Con Inc will be dead before we get to 2030. You’re seeing its death throes now. Nobody younger than 50 believes their schtick anymore.

                    Ostei:  Same (although I plan to check out before I lose my marbles or ability to wipe my own backside).  Plan on providing basic services (water, toilets, electricity) for yourself.  We’ve been looking into getting a second 1000 gallon propane tank (to run the Generac to run well pump, etc.) and local hardware store has two in the yard but they’re not for sale (repos being held for owner).  Online and out of state new ones are $4200 and up.Looking into some basic solar panels (have a few foldable ones and a few solar ‘generators’) but electricity and wiring is not in my wheelhouse (and solar system for everything is not in current budget).  Glad we at least have a well and a septic system.

                Small scale production of everything from electric power to complex machinery is more possible today than ever with things like networked 3D printers. There’s even a hobbyist IC fabrication movement of people making their own chips, though I’m sure nothing like the mainstream CPUs.This kind of thing would be a good basis for local and regional re-industrialization and ultimately for re-localizing political and economic power as the federal authority continues to stagger under the weight of its diversity ideology and untenable overseas entanglements.For that reason I would expect the Left to ultimately try (but fail) to prevent people from doing things like generating their own electricity or purifying their own water. What they will likely do is try to outlaw small generators (because climate change) while trying to force everyone to use solar and wind and sell their power to the grid on ever less favorable terms.They *will* try to make all forms of non-participation in their failed system a crime. That should not discourage anyone from doing so. In fact, the more “outlaws” there are the more impossible it will be for them to stop anyone and the sooner the whole system becomes irrelevant and both morally and financially bankrupt.

        I read through that Freedom Conservatism:  A Statement of Principles.  A lot of it sounds good – on paper.  But it’s the usual same old, same old “we have to return to our founding ethos” – whatever.  In bullet point 3, the boys and girls promise to uphold the rule of law, freedom of contract and freedom of association.  Then in number 8, they ADAMANTLY oppose racial discrimination in all its forms, either against or for any person or group of people.  So how can one exercise their freedom of association it they can’t discriminate against whomever they choose for whatever reason, including race, sex, nationality etc.?  The short answer is they can’t.Then you look at many of the signatories of this pablum and that tells you all you need to know…

            You see more than a few Libertarian names in that group.Notice that they very carefully tiptoe around the matter of morality?  They make oblique references to ‘local control’ and ‘religious freedom,’ but never get around to stating–outright–that screwing little kids is BAD and which object goes into what bodily orifice.  They avoid the abortion question, yet refer to the Declaration which clearly states that there is a God.  That God is the one the Founders knew about; even Franklin, the rounder of the bunch, acknowledged that.The discontent in this country has a great deal to do with that ‘religion’ question–the one they strive to avoid.What you have there is a bunch of gutless wonders.

                You see a bunch of “poem-on-the-statue” names on that list, and #6 “Americans by choice. Immigration is a principal driver of American prosperity and achievement” is demonstrably untrue. Immigrants use public assistance at double the rate of natives and it’s probably higher than that when you consider how many access aid through their US born offspring who are counted as citizens. Latin American and Caribbean immigration is particularly costly.

            No one ever poses this possibility. The negro makes up 16% of our population. The Hispanic somewhere in the vicinity of 30%. It has been my experience that the two do NOT relish the other. If the Hispanic prevail, the Negro will have to stop blaming Whitey for all his self-imposed problems and start badmouthing the Hispanics. Neither group has the IQ it takes overall to push this country forward.

                They’ll blame whoever they’re told to blame. If America was completely run by Hispanics, the blacks would quickly become mixed Zambos and be confined to the favelas. Hispanics will f*ck anything.
They would also cease being a major problem as they would no longer be weaponized a certain way, if Hispanics owned the media.

        A little PT, but good one behind the green d oor, clearly the GOP is dead. the big SCREAMING by it’s absence issue is the COVID debacle . a third of small businesses in this country were destroyed , millions of lives ruined . and neither party will talk about it at all. RFK is and is being given the big ignore by many voters.  this country deserves a second biden term, followed by a kamala term.

        To this day old East Germans still cling to the “good old days” under the DDR. Back then they were paid for digging a hole and filling it in again.
Oddly, they have forgotten that their neighbors were often dragged away in the middle of the night for even whispering anything negative about the regime they had to live under.
And if asked about it now, they will argue the Stasi was just doing their job and anyone who was hauled away probably deserved what they got.

        Yeah. I think the Left is very frustrated by the fact that every project they undertook failed. They think they failed because of conservatives and white men. So, that is why they are bent on getting rid of white men. Once we are gone, all obstacles to ending poverty, racism, saving earth, and singing kumbaya on the deck of the starship Enterprise will be gone.The right is just hopeless. I can empathize. I’ve been there. Even recently I was thinking that if only the principles of liberty could be explained to enough people the nation of ideas would triumph. Wrong!I think TomA has a great post today. Look in the mirror and be very honest. Am I a Lion in life in terms of absolutely owning myself and being an undeniable master of myself and the skills I wield in the world? Do I comport myself as such? Our goal as an individual should be thus and that should be our focus.As a folk, this interview with an Afrikaaner who is walking the walk of digging trenches with his folk is an essential watch. This is what we must be doing here in our homeland. We owe it to our ancestors not to abandon it in a panic. We owe our posterity an opportunity to inherit and reconquer it in the future.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-q9KjR9S8We must remember, that we can dig in and take care of business. It won’t be easy. It won’t be perfect. All kinds of things could go wrong, but only cowards live in a perpetual, pre-emptive defeat by what could go wrong. We must greet every day with shovel, shield and sword and belief. Dig in. There will be opportunities and we’ll have a chance to capitalize or our posterity will. In the meantime, to cop one of the few good leftists slogans, be the change you want to see.

        The thing that struck me first about this piece is that so much of our people just do nothing productive at all. This is on both sides, not just the progressives. The con-inc people are the same as their supposed enemies, they grift and con their way into money without any accomplishments or contributing anything to society as a whole.Their output is useless meaningless words that will never change anything. We used to be a nation whose people were primarily making things, designing things or facilitating the movement of things to benefit everyone.Now there are thousands on both sides whose production is words. They are freeloading off the productive and destroying the society for the rest of us. The good thing, I suppose is that when things fall apart these people will be the first casualties. I’m trying to imagine a feral Kevin Williamson trying to survive after the apocolypse. Spoiler alert, he won’t for long.

            “Now there are thousands on both sides whose production is words.”And they are not even half-assed good at it. Shakespeare pointed out that “Words without thought ne’er to Heaven go.” But that’s all we get: words without thought.I think of the ubiquity of “possible.” What the eff, for example, is “a possible tornado” or “a possible broken arm” or “a possible earthquake” etc, etc, etc, ad nauseam? Are there impossible tornadoes or impossible broken arms? And if so, how are they different from possible phenomena?And “possible” is only one of myriad such thoughtless, witless, brainless locutions, apparently ALL of which are published nowadays. Readers here no doubt have their favorites. Or least favorites, as may be.

                My sense is that precisely the same group of Sanhedrin write all of the words for both the ostensible “Left” and the ostensible “Right”.If the potato kneegrow, Joseph Biden, is reading speeches written by the likes of (((Merrick Garland))) and (((Jeffrey Zients))), whereas the   ostensibly oppositional potato kneegrow, Kevin McCarthy, is reading speeches written by the likes of (((Frank Luntz))) and (((Robert Kagan))), then we don’t have a political dialogue in this country.Instead, we have a ceaseless droning buzzing humming background vibration of verisimilitudinous pseudo-political Good Think delirium.All hail The Signal!!!================Which then begs the question of how the potato kneegrow, Bobby Jr, was able to disconnect himself from The Signal.I’m telling youse guys, Bobby Jr might not be allowed to continue breathing oxygen much longer.If Bobby Jr is who he appears to be, then Bobby Jr poses an existential threat to the Council of the Sanhedrin.And we know all to well what happens to those amongst the goyim who pose an existential threat to the Council of the Sanhedrin…

        Cultural exhaustion is racial exhaustion, and has much more to do with the the great war(s) in Europe than it does the end of the Cold War.  Americans are simply falling back into a history which no one on the Continent (save the current globalist muppets in charge) ever pretended they escaped.That aisde, if politics is downstream from culture, it is no wonder that left and right are falling apart, to the point that the the left/right spectrum is now largely meaningless inside the larger category of race.Our Man in Tyneside, with whom Z should have had about three conversations already, has a great video on hauntology:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muB-ELT59WYMark Fisher, the British Marxist who had some useful things to say about hauntology before hanging himself, managed years ago to produce what now looks like a leftwing version of “Freedom Conservatism” called “Exiting the Vampire Castle.”  It is worth reading.https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/exiting-vampire-castle/

            Yeah I’d say Morgoth is the second-best essayist behind Zeeman.
He’s a bit of a Debbie Downer though. Z takes the top spot because he suggests there’s a whiff of hope after the collapse. Morgoth is just collapse. Can’t blame him though, he’s from England. Americans have a natural positivity that Britons lack.

        I think for me personally, 9/11 and the whole covid thing really brought home my inability to see what the future brings. Bottom line, knowing that 19 Saudis with boxcutters would kill thousands and cost us trillions with a 20 year war with no victory, followed up with a multi year shut down fuckery that lost us half our household income with no tangible proof really proves my inability to predict. I’ll channel my inner Rumsfeld and think about unknown unknowns, this is a totally different kettle. Lefties want to go back to the sixties, righties want to go back to the eighties, the future is neither of those. The future is ugly and a lot of people are going to get their hands dirty.

        Let’s not just pick on the past; the present and the future are equally likely to serve as sources of unprofitable daydreams. The fundamental issue here is not that politics is lost in the past, it is that politics is lost.And it isn’t difficult to understand why. Daydreams are painless and cost nothing. They also provide a degree of latitude that no actual engagement with reality ever can. As long as you don’t propose to really do anything, you can imagine anything you want. But the instant you decide to set foot into the arena and act, you must respect the fact that “politics is the art of the possible,” as the old saying goes (a saying that many dissidents would do well to heed).As another saying has it, “in war, the enemy gets a vote.” And since politics is war by other means, the that saying applies here as well. You aren’t just going to get what you want. You may not like the Left, or the special interests, the trade unions, the government agencies, academia, the media, or the race hustlers, but you can’t wish them away, either. Their institutions have real power and you aren’t going to just shove these walruses off the beach without a fight.That is why it is fatal to abandon the political processas it really exists. As much as some of you like to repeat the mantra that “we aren’t voting our way out of this,” there is no better way to hand victory to the enemy than to just pick up and abandon the fight. The electoral process is one of the means at your disposal that you can’t afford to neglect. Whether the system is corrupt or subverted or even theoretically defensible or not, is not a question that has any meaning for politics. What matters is whether it returns results that must be respected, and we see that this is still very much the case. The Left wouldn’t bother to steal elections if elections didn’t matter. They obviously do, because elections are the legal forms of the results you are obligated to acknowledge, regardless of how that result was obtained. A man may try to pay with a counterfeit dollar but he never tries to pay with counterfeit monopoly money. As always, hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, not to other vices.Thus, the idea that you can win without voting is itself a very pernicious fantasy. The day will one day come when the acknowledged political means are no longer parliamentary and democratic, but two things:1) That day has not come yet.2) That day will not come by way of those who abstain from the system, but by those who use the system until they break it.The rule of thumb to remember is that those who will be the future are those who do something to the present.

            What if ALL the political candidates, regardless of party, are essentially owned by the same elites who appear to be ushering us toward civilizational chaos? How can voting circumvent such a scenario?
I used to say: “It’s not the lesser of two evils; it’s the evil of two lessers.” But even that now seems false. In reality, it’s the evil of ONE lesser. The notion that common plebes like you and I have a genuine choice in the voting booth is part of the grand deception.

            I like the posture and energy that holds and animates your post. There is evidence to the contrary that it is incorrect. They abound so I won’t elaborate – well, okay, John Fetterman; Dan Crenshaw.In certain locales and at the state and local level however, I think you are correct.However, there is a shrinking time window where the most effective option is lawfare with a tactical and strategic intent that is focused on punishing any and all anti-white discrimination. The system is deeply corrupt, but anybody will show up if there is money to be gained no matter the cause. White people should become sue happy given the outrageous and brazen discrimination against us.I agree with your point about who controls the system will built the replacement for what they use its power to tear it down. However, it looks a lot like we have passed that point – Build Back Better is in motion and America is gone. That said, I’d love a list of candidates who we could vote for who will assert control. Republican controlled heartland states are actively engaged in The Great Replacement – they are in fact its vanguards. So, who do you vote for there?The Supreme Court’s AA decision is meaningless. For starters it has to be enforced. For non-starters it left a hole for colleges to use race based essays. Worse, it condoned racial discrimination in the military. At the same time the nominee for JCOS is a rabidly anti-white guy whose time in the Air Force consisted of building a racial quota plan with whites constrained to only 40% of the officer core.It almost looks like Roberts is fully on boardThe confirmation is up soon. If the Republican controlled house strikes this nominee down on firm grounds that he is using racial quotas. If they strike this nominee down, then maybe voting matters. If they approve him, as they approved Ketanji name-hyphen-name who can’t even say if an American is born with natural/negative rights as a Supreme Court Justice, then voting for a Republican controlled House will not have mattered in the least.It looks like Roberts stole the argument from the Republicans as Dems and neo-cons can point to Roberts’ ruling as full support for an anti-white military pogrom and race based officer apportionment. They have also gotten Tuberville to bend the knee and apologize. In doing so, they whipped up the white supremacist boogey man that must be overcome by appointment this anti-white black man as JCOS. The Left and their media are masters of propaganda, psy-ops, manipulation and timing. It almost seems as if Roberts is on the take and gave the perfect ruling for a continuation of the status quo – Revolution unabated to Finish The Job.I agree it is foolish to surrender, but it just isn’t clear that voting is the lynchpin of an effective set of answers.

            Intelligent Dasein:  I’m not aware of anyone here predicting dissidents  ‘win’ with or without voting.  The consensus seems to be that AINO is going off a cliff sometime in the future (1 year, 5 years, in our lifetime, take your pick) and there is f**k all the average individual can do about it.  Voting within a corrupt and venal system gives legitimacy to said system and continues the pretense that genuine change is possible and that the average individual actually has a say in the future.Those who will be the future are those being born today.  In AINO (and England and Australia and Canada and France and Germany etc.) he will be named Mohammed, Juan, Ho Peng, Vivek, and Dontavious.  Those Whites who survive will be those who separate themselves from the present political and cultural morass, not those who become enmeshed in its corrupting and evil coils.

        It is impossible for most whites to picture to themselves the future, because they are living their lives as if there isn’t one. The reasons for this are too numerous to detail in full. But we all sense it when we meet such types — there is a aura of finality in everything they do, very much like a death cult. For most of them, however, they are unaware of it — like Tom Sawyer’s crew of whitewashers, every day they blindly line up for a new destructive assignment in exchange for an apple.

        The political nostalgia for the 80s is weird.  Dissidents in the 80s were constantly criticized and mocked for having political nostalgia for the 50s.
I don’t know about the 50s and 60s, but I lived through the 80s. There is nothing to be nostalgic about (politically), especially not race relations. It only looks less bad than today, but that really isn’t saying much.

            I generally agree with that, Tars. We do tend to look at the 80s through roseate glasses. However, I will say this for the 80s–the culture was  nowhere near as odious and insipid as it is now. Rap was not the nation’s soundtrack; idiotic Superhero films were not the cinema du jour; television wasn’t a perpetual stream of filth; and we weren’t beaten over the head constantly with images of negroes.Culturally, America was far from ideal, but at least normal people could dabble in it without feeling unmitigated disgust and outrage. Now the only hope for sanity is to disengage to the greatest possible extent.

                “There is nothing to be nostalgic about (politically), especially not race relations. It only looks less bad”The seeds of destruction were well planted and enthusiastically tended even then. At that time, the Left hadn’t quite figured out the winning formula. We were inundated with X are just like us with the Bill Cosby in his sweaters dishing out wisdom and virtue. Gibson and his more sensible partner Glover were bringing down Apartheid and the Brat Pack made us aware that our hard working parents were square and goofy.With greater exposure to the wonders of diversity and their inevitable crime wave of the 90s, the Left figured they had largely deluded the whites as far as they could.The winning strategy turned out to be one of holding what you’ve got, and radicalism for the remainder. Forget the just like us push… compartmentalize every single category and sub-group, load them up with grievances to explain their failures,  and point your new human missle at the white men.I am not telling you anything you don’t know already, but I do now see the rot that began back in the 80s in my teen years. With a few notable exceptions like the movie Red Dawn and outliers like Heavy Metal music… that was the last gasp of decent America. Even then, we were blindly traipsing through fields of barely covered seeds of our destruction.…

                    Penitent Man: “the last gasp of decent America”I’ve poasted this before chez Z, but here it goes again: I have a very strong clear memory of walking past a newspaper machine in the summer of 1990 [wikipedia says it was in September], and me glancing at the headlines, and seeing that W-41 had agreed to a tax increase, thereby breaking his solemn pledge to “Read His Lips”.Anyway, the memory was of having been stabbed not so much in the back as ackshually having been stabbed foursquare in the heart.Muh instincts knew that something turrible had just happened.Something epochal.[Although, at the time, being just a dumb stoopid kid, I wouldn’t have been able to have thought in terms of “epochs”.]But there it went: All the wonder &amp; hope &amp; joy &amp; optimism &amp; sheer bliss of the Reagan era simply vanished in the blink of an eye.In retrospect, it is very very difficult to overemphasize the existential harm which the Bush family inflicted upon Heritage Amurrikkkuh.

                        Ostei,Agreed, and we’ve all discussed the origins (Frankfurt School, Alinsky, the sexual revolution, etc.).
What chaps my hide is that these things were cleverly and slyly presented to the trusting youth in a wholesome or righteous wrapping. Hippies were to be mocked but the real Leftists were the ones that shed the childlike veneer of 60s Counterculture and worked their deviltry as teachers, pols, writers and movie makers.
At least for my children, the opposition is out in the open and clearly and vehemently despises them. Subtlety is dead.

                The ’80s were when comic book movies, hiphop, Michael Jordan, the televised male buttocks and nude boomer divorce pillow talk took over popular culture. What’s different from now is that there was also other stuff made for people who thought all that was crap—and in sum that other stuff was a huge majority of all stuff.In theory that’s still the situation. An uncountable bounty of interesting present-day things is hidden on the internet…possibly. Who can know? Those things used to be at the store. They used to be *advertised*. Now even if you know the exact name of what you want there’s half a chance Google will hide it from you.

                I agree that pop culture was better in the 80s, which is why I said (politically), especially race.  I was constantly berated about race in the 80s, not to mention the bad old days before feminism.  The 80s was also a time of constant gay propaganda and the poor gays dying of “grids” (AIDS) and those mean normal people who don’t want to be around them and how we’re homophobic for wanting them to not donate blood.

                Ostei:  I spent most of the ’80s overseas, and what I do remember about that decade is not positive or roseate at all.  I categorically reject any nostalgia for the ’70s and most of the ’60s.  If I have anemoia, it’s for a fictional late 1940s and early 1950s – with a totally different future trajectory than what actually occurred.  Electricity, indoor plumbing, antibiotics, traditional sexual roles, White nations, and the patriarachy – minus intrusive tech, farming conglomerates, and any non-White immigration. Oh, my fantasy past would eliminate television as well.

                    Bear in mind Truman integrated the military in 1948, so if you’re going to be a purist, you may have to fantasize about 1947. At any rate, I think most of us will agree that America was a great place even for hard-shell rightwingers into the mid-60s. At that point, however, the nation began to deteriorate noticeably, and the 80s were merely the final speed bump over which the New Left battalions ultimately rolled. Circa 2010, the process of decay increased dramatically again (much like the second half of the 60s), and when Biden was sworn in, the USA became AINO. Now, any normal white person must view this country with unalloyed hatred and contempt.

                I was a teenager. Even as a teenager I was well aware of all the bad political stuff. The pushing of gays and integration and “anti-racism” and radical feminism was all present.Having been a teen in the 80s, yes, there was a lot of good times. But my personal good times is not political.The 80s is when they started bringing “racists” on TV to make fools of and throw tomatoes at them for being so evil.Lets not forget about all the gay propaganda that was everywhere back then. Don’t forget all the feminist stuff too.Nostalgia is a strange drug.  In 20 years, there are going to be people painting the 2020s as the good old days.

                    I think the difference between 1980s pop culture and today’s pop culture is in 1980’s pop culture you still had to actively seek out leftist books, TV shows, and movies in order to consume leftist content.  Today, the opposite is true.  You have to make an effort to avoid mainstream media content because virtually everything is suffused with leftist agitprop, often explicitly so.

            I think many people, especially conservatives, look on the 1980s fondly because it was, arguably, the last full decade that America had the semblance of a unified culture.  It was the decade before Third World immigration (legal and illegal) really skyrocketed, before the passage of NAFTA and the offshoring of millions of manufacturing jobs, before the LGBTQIA+ agitprop really began to permeate the culture, The 1980s were just before the rise of the internet and the fracturing of pop culture into a myriad of subcultures.

        “Sixty years ago, when the founders of the Buckley cult were getting started, they used language designed to inflame the passions of the great White middle-class, which they sensed was seething at the cultural changes that had been unleashed by the left.”
Unfortunately, the great White middle-class isn’t so great anymore, or numerous for that matter.  And no one is sure as hell allowed to use any kind of language that might perhaps, maybe, possibly, when hell freezes over, inflame whatever passions are left in that dwindling group.  A sad state affairs to be sure…

        Both the Left and the Right remain in the past because neither has a plan for the future.The Right wants institutions and a culture based 18th century Anglo-American men for a country where whites will soon be a minority. The institutions and culture of that coming America (even the America of today) will reflect its biology, making that goal impossible. With no answer to that, the Right retreats into pretty words and ideas from long ago.Perhaps more surprisingly, the Left also doesn’t want to move forward. The Right’s desire to go back to the 1980s is understandable, but the Left’s similar desire is more tricky. You would think that with demographics and control of the culture on their side, the Left would relish moving forward. It’ll be there country after all.However, the Left has a few problems. First, a country that’s 15% black and 30% Hispanic simply won’t function that well, especially if blacks, Hispanics and women are actually running the institutions. The Left wants to smack whitey around and put non-whites and women in charge, but it also wants a country as well-run as it was in the 1980s. That’s a problem.Second, if the Left goes full hate whitey and openly acknowledges that this will never end, there’s a reasonable chance that enough whites will join the identity politics games and that would cause the whole system to grind to a halt.Finally, the current Left is run by whites and Jews – mostly Jews. If they truly move forward to their utopia, it means that they will get pushed out and non-whites will move into the positions of power. That’s not something that they want.So, both sides are stuck in the past. But, here’s the thing, reality doesn’t care. A multi-everything America is coming, and the culture of old America have been torn down and called evil. However, for now, there’s nothing to replace the old institutions so they hobble along, but with the biology – and thus culture – changing, eventually so will the institutions.Neither side has an answer as to how to move forward because there is no answer that maintains the old America.

            Nobody has an answer.Even Dissidents don’t know what is coming. We are aware of the current state of the West from correctly observing the world around us. But none of us really know what to do going forward. We are doing what we can but there’s no real game plan on a larger scale. I’ve thought alot about what needs to be done and there’s no realistic way of achieving it without gaining power, organization, and institutions.Funnily enough, Christian Nationalists have an answer and they are probably the only group with a coherent worldview that would actually be relevant moving forward. (Not saying it’s a future I WANT… But it does make sense). And they have some level of organization and institutions. Enough to at least fill regional voids.Leftists are a mess and will be taken over by whatever strong horse, be it Islam, China, even India. They are genuinely confused about the Muslim pushback on the LGBT agenda, since only white men are homophobic. They are not serious people. They can’t have their anti white guy police state without white men doing it, but the US will quickly turn into Brazil, which isn’t capable of being a police state.

                Yeah, hard to say what comes next. Brazil is a reasonable choice, but who knows.
As you note, the irony of the Left is that they want to impose an apartheid system on whites, but that system could only be maintained by whites.
The Left are incompetent and unrealistic. They live in a narrative world that only exists because whites still play along. How long will that last?
I don’t know. California, Mexico and, even, South Africa are still (somewhat) hobbling along. As long as upper middle class whites can escape the brown hoard, nothing will change.

            The establishment right refuses to give up its religious belief that race shouldn’t matter.  They seem to believe that some combination of free market economics and traditional values can turn the incompatible races into a harmonious and law-abiding citizenry.  They are willing to destroy the country before questioning this tenant.
The left’s primary goal is the dispossession of traditional whites.  They seem to believe that they can handle all the remaining problems after this goal is achieved.

                The Left really can’t grok the reality that traditional whites are the critical support for their delusional perspectives that water simply comes from the faucet, electricity from.the outlet, and food from the store.

I also find it amusing that the link the twitter guy pointed to, written by a scholar known as Billionaire Psycho, has over three times the engagement all these other scholars had in their manifesto while being probably a one man show.
I can’t imagine what they did wrong. They even quoted MLK!

        I have some normie friends who are still posting Ronald Reagan videos on social media.  They write things like “the media is trying to divide us by race.”  They truly believe that if the right people are elected, we will magically return to 1985 where kids will go to HS dances and rock concerts and young kids will play outside and run around in the woods.This fantasy is beyond maddening.  None of that is happening, and even if you somehow elected the “right people” (which we all know is impossible), a very large portion of the “country” doesn’t share the same values.  A mosh mash of races will never share their values because they can’t.  Even that nice black family in your neighborhood is going to support all of the nut jobs and anti white scoundrels because they will always take up for their own.  The message matters not, it’s all about “he’s one of us!”.  We saw this with Obama.  Of the few blacks who vote, nearly 100% of them supported Obama.  Not one of them could describe any of the policy changes, they just knew he was one of them.Like others have stated, everything is about race.  Nothing else matters.  Race and racial hatred is at the heart of every issue we face in our society today.  The left has successfully destroyed western civilization because they refuse to accept that the square peg is not going into that round hole.  When you need to coerce your indigenous population to accept non whites there is obviously a failure.So when I see normie still pining for the days of Reagan and “the hood old days” it makes me sad.  A country is made up of a people and the GAE does not have such a thing.  It is an entirely new, unrecognizable land mass that has been sucked dry of its once rich resources.  The new moral code is to worship violent negros and allow low IQ savages to rape your children.  Going back to policies of the past isn’t going to have any effect on this “people” whatsoever.

            Reply to “Tired Citizen”Great post! The diction is measured and sober, but the content makes the reader want to stand up and cheer! It has about it something of “a Macaulay air,” if I can put it that way, which recalls “The Lays of Ancient Rome.” Well done!And combined with ZMan’s reference to Banquo, we find ourselves starting this week with literary echoes of our proud past, however ironic that might be, given the theme of ZMan’s post this morning.“And how can man die betterThan facing fearful oddsFor the ashes of his fathersAnd the temples of his gods?”

                On the literary kick…“For I am fighting for the old days, the old ways I love so much but which, I fear, are now gone forever, no matter how the die may fall. For, win or lose, we lose just the same.If we win this war and have the Cotton Kingdom of our dreams, we still have lost, for we will become a different people and the old quiet ways will go. The world will be at our doors clamoring for cotton and we can command our own price. Then, I fear, we will become like the Yankees, at whose money-making activities, acquisitiveness and commercialism we now sneer. And if we lose, Melanie, if we lose!I am not afraid of danger or capture or wounds or even death, if death must come, but I do fear that once this war is over, we will never get back to the old times. And I belong in those old times. I do not belong in this mad present of killing and I fear I will not fit into any future, try though I may. Nor will you, my dear, for you and I are of the same blood. I do not know what the future will bring, but it cannot be as beautiful or as satisfying as the past.“– Ashley Wilkes (Gone With The Wind)At least Ashley had the sense that there was no going back to the old days, but he didn’t know what to do so just kept on, hoping that his duty could help maybe preserve them.  These cuckservatives still have their heads in the sand.

            I’m as nostalgic about the 80s as anybody and would freakin’ love it if there were still bands like Journey and the rest. . .but that world is dead and gone.  IT FAILED!No one was fighting to defend it.  US won the Cold War and the economy boomed, meanwhile the border was wide open, the domestic jobs went bye-bye, youth were sacrificed to the molochs of abortion and the college racket, and all the women were taught to be ruthless whores.From my POV, it started with the women.  Feminism was the cultural coup de grace from which there is no recovery.  These white gals are harsh broads who weaponize their sexuality and the hatred of the imagined patriachy.The left and right would always be against porno because it made a victims of the women performers.  Bull!  It made victims of the millions of viewers it addicted and ruined!  The men!The Muslims *are* right about women.  Women using the visual of their sexuality is harassment that is totally the equal and equivalent of a man physically groping or imposing himself on a woman.Now all these broads do it!  If there is a buck to made on onlyfans by exploiting and taking away the money of starving fools, it is done.  It started with the women.  Once men are so cucked as to let women have say in a land that men fought for and built, it’s all over.

                ” … youth were sacrificed to the molochs of abortion and the college racket, and all the women were taught to be ruthless whores.”Not only the youth, but the whole people. And the Moloch was universal suffrage. Everything you name was the result of vote-buying, and vote-buying was the direct result of relentless expansion of the suffrage. But “the women’s vote” with no-fault divorce and with unrestricted access to abortion, etc.And universal suffrage resulted from the population having believed our own wartime propaganda, which began with the Declaration’s  language “all men are created equal,” which was a deliberate propaganda ploy to influence French intellectuals into lending material support to the war that had already been underway for 14 months or so.Propaganda is staggeringly effective, but believing our own propaganda has caused us to swallow the poison pill of universal suffrage. Everything else has followed from that.

It’s true, though. Just because apartheid is the natural and humane state of affairs, doesn’t mean the media isn’t trying to start a race war.

                Vinnyvette:  Cognitive dissonance is not limited to the left.  Dissidents and most certainly conservatards have their own versions.  See:  arming the mujahideen, Dept. of Education, Nafta, etc. etc.  Some memorable phrases and speeches along with a sunny attitude do not a strong culture and nation make.  And yes, I was an adult (21 and up) during the ’80s.  They were not all that great.

        Freedom Conservatism is an amusing little Substack. No comments are allowed, but the second post has the title “Initial reaction to the Freedom Conservatism Statement of Principles”. The subtitle here boasts about “Hundreds of thousands of readers on the first day of publication”, but the canned green beans (the FCSOP) have received only 69 hearts of love during the five days since publication.

            While I generally like and enjoy Substack and the concept it represents, it reminds me a lot of washed-up pop singers who decide to perform country music in their old age. Lots of old acts go to Substack to die, so that is the perfect place for Freedom Conservative.

                The relatively young Dominic. Cummings is an exception to that. I like and respect his stuff, and I only wish he’d post a little more frequently. The only thing is that some of his prose is written in SW1speak, and I probably misunderstand–or simply don’t understand–some of his points.

                Indeed.  I also maintain that the comment section is part and parcel of the message of the publication. Seems many in the Substack community have perceived this and only allow paid subscribers to post comments.  Better than no comment section to be sure, but a de facto recognition of the value of user feedback.

        Describing Nick Fuentes as “young” seems a very conscious modifier, much like the way the media describes the bag of White House cocaine as “small”.
And it’s true.  In a different age the 20-something Fuentes would have ceased being young.  Not so today for his generation.  Will they, can they ever grow up?

                    It is even worse. Will’s wife is or at least was a lobbyist for migrant labor in the agriculture industry. As a result, Will supports open borders and mass migration.Now his wife is a muckety wump with the Tim Scott for President juggernaut, which tells me there is at least a plan among the conservacucks to insert Uncle Tim into the top slot. It will/would be hilariousWill regularly cites Reagan and praises him, but in the day he was a great critic of the Gipper Grifter and a big Bush supporter.The man always has been a fraud. I really didn’t even know he was still alive until his wife joined the Tim! campaign and he started to work the rope line.Truly a grotesque and vile figure. He should bring back the bow tie.

        Yeah, the Right is rummaging though the ideological attic looking for inspiration while the Left gets on with inventing the future, new genders and AI/new humans.And it’s not just the GOP and Griller-Cons. Much of the discourse on the new Right is backward looking: Yarvin and Neo-Monarchists, BAP looking to Nietzche and the classic Greeks, the TradCath movement and its fellow travelers (Patrick Casey et al.), etc.Beyond the obvious utility as a coping mechanism, nostalgia is pretty understandable because today’s thinkers are looking for successful models from the past to recycle for the future. But it’s unlikely this ideological goulash can stem the Leftist tide. You’d think they’d all join together and say: “we will figure out the Ideology later, but we can all agree that we have to stop the Left now”.

That would require action from inert people. To be fair, bellies are full and houses are warm, so why bother now? Inertia is a luxury, and one that will not and cannot be sustained when things become as horrible economically as they are now socially. And that is coming.

        Yes angst is a normal reaction to the present insanity. But that emotion does nothing to improve your life in the present, nor offer hope for the future. So why wallow in it?Better is to seek refuge from the Crazy and obtain as much joy and happiness as the present reality will allow. Both mental and physical fitness can be acquired via hard work (including physical labor) and a focus on growth. Learn new things that are useful and help others to do the same. Take pride in small accomplishments and be step-wise in your labors. Everyone should have a garden, even if only a potted plant. Shun the news to keep your spirits up and ignore what you cannot change.If, or when, the clarion call for higher purpose is sounded, act with intelligence and resolve, and go out with a bang if need be.

        I would argue that we have been partying since 1945. We’ve been living in an American triumphalist bubble ever since. Liberals want to live in the movie “Casablanca”. Conservatives want to live in “Back to Bataan”.

        Yeah, I don’t know. When you’re going down a bad path, you back up. Same thing with our current moment. I don’t even think there is anything new that could possibly exist when it comes to political organization.The real question is how far back do you need to go? Very stupid people think we go back to 2016, stupid people think 1981, ordinary dummies think 1951. But we have to go back, because there was some serious of decisions that put us on the wrong path.The American educational industry is dedicated to eliminating this thinking process. Talk to any normie and he will inform you that the concept of property and freedom was invented in 1776 – anything that reconsiders those ideas is simply an attempt to make us all dirt-farming victims of an absolutist tyrant.But no, there’s no going forward to something uniquely new because history doesn’t work like that. We don’t believe progressive notions of history having some arc toward justice. We’ve messed up and we have to go back. Simple as.

                “So the question is where?”The problem is spiritual. Or psychological, if you prefer.And so is the answer.So in answer to your “Where?” the simplest answer would be “to the 12th century.” When man was truly comfortable–speaking psychically–in his own body and in his larger environment. And between here and there lie the obstacles of the Great War, the Bolshevik revolutions, Darwin, the French Revolution (1789), and so on. Materialism in general.The difficulty, of course, is getting there, past all those obstacles. That can most certainly be done, but it would require powers of imagination and discipline that very few people have. And that assumes that anybody would even understand that one *can* go back. Most don’t. Most can’t. Another facet of the almost-universal failure of imagination.

                    It is impossible to go back. What we can do is learn from past mistakes (and successes) and incorporate those lessons into the future we must build. Is there something from the 12th century that will help in the 21st? I imagine so. But we must be shrewd enough to discern what it is.

        With the response of Mike Pence to Tucker concerning weapons in the Ukraine we can see the baby boomer Reagan Van Winkles that was popular on the right for many years,  the Rush Limbaugh and neocon right, although perhaps Rush was pulling away from the neocons in his last years?The baby boomers on the left have gone from burning bras and opposing Vietnam to tranny sex and supporting foreign wars but they continue to look back at the 60’s for inspiration, they continue to oppose the man even though they are the man now.The bigger point is maybe it’s the baby boomers death rattle that is the problem of the current age? I say that as a baby boomer myself.Our ideas are in the past and the following generations have yet to come up with their own ideas and heroes? And maybe they never will? Maybe we are such a mish mash of people now we are destined for mediocrity and just replaying Indiana Jones.

            Boomers catch a lot of heat because, of course, they are the worst collection of human beings, ever. They deserve all of it. But, they are simply the penultimate endpoint of massive historical forces that predate their uselessness by centuries.
I guess I’m saying their awfulness is not entirely their fault.

                    The basic pernicious influence upon the Boomer generation was wealth brought about by the GAE (American Hegemony) post WWII. Nothing is inherently wrong with the people per se.  Any other generation following on would have performed the same way given the same environment.
This blaming of one generation for the results of the next is tiresome and non-productive.  As a Boomer, I guess I should blame the “Greatest Generation” for my failures and so on and so forth.

                        Right. Carrots and sticks. I can’t say I’d have been as willing to question the status quo if it had been working for me, so I have that much understanding.
Believe me, having grown up in LanCo, and having seen what material prosperity has done to the place, I grew up hating money. Made me weirdly monastic, in fact. So I get the pernicious influence of wealth. What I never understood was why the people who would complain about the same things I was complaining about were quick to call me a commie for pointing out the cause. Fwiw.

                    Hindsight is 20/20. The Boomers had no idea what TV was doing to them.
Here’s an interesting television interview with Aldous Huxley from 1958; perceptive as Huxley was, he seems to not be particularly worried about television, in his opinion television is being used for good.

My generation, X, unleashed computer games and internet porn on the world, and made good mint on the side. So maybe we should be careful with the Boomer-hate; it might come back to bite us.

The problem is antecedent to that. Besides which, tens of millions of Boomers were subject to those same influences without becoming lunatics. There’s very little–if any at all–cause and effect there.

Reserve your respect for others who post here.I was hesitant, but *before* I had to “crap or get off the pot”, before my queued position for vexination, I got Covid.After a bout of Covid,  I reverted to a more reasoned person—rather than a panic cow in the herd.  The effect of the disease on me was that of a slight cold and my training in school taught me to believe in and respect “natural immunity”.As a retiree from the university, and life in general, there were never any hard choices to make.  No one threatened me with unemployment or censure.  I never gave a crap whether I got into a store or boarded an airplane.My world got smaller, yes—but the need for this world got even smaller.

                        I’ve seen too much media-driven herd behavior in my day to believe otherwise. The screen is the only thing that can do that, because it’s seductive. All the worse now that you carry it with you, but at least the internet wasn’t monolithic for a while.

        Number 7 on the linked list is a real howler:The best way to unify a large and diverse nation like the United States is to transfer as many public policy choices as possible to families and communities.What says national unity and effective government like letting a large group of people with almost nothing in common do whatever they want?  A few years ago I saw a column from a National Review intern where he claimed he had shared culture with a non white because they both loved watching baseball and eating Taco Bell.  I see Kevin Williamson is a signer, I haven’t seen his name pop up anywhere in months.  I wonder when whoever funds his career will pull the plug.

        The conservative cosplay essay you linked has to be seen as of a piece with the candidate forum Tucker Carlson hosted Friday in Iowa. I really think Con, Inc., died at the event. Even more than the bromides, cliches and stilted poses, the absolute artifice of robots such as Tim Scott and Mike Pence went well beyond self-parody. It was as is the “freedom-conservative” (LOL) author had written a script for them. It was more Austin Powers than Rip Van Winkley. If you haven’t watched it please do.I read a responsive piece to freedom-conservative banality this weekend along the lines of what I just wrote, and will link it later if found, but it didn’t go far enough. Trump may have exposed Con, Inc., as the duplicitous fraud it is, but the  Carlson-hosted forum was the Suez Crisis that put a formal end to the farce. It is doubtful that the number of people who support these positions exceeds single digits now yet those who embrace the golden oldies own the Republican Party lock, stock and barrel. That party itself is dead and will have its individual Suez Crisis in 2024.

        This shows up a lot with the people who are still convinced that if enough of the ‘right’ candidates are voted into office the wheels of time will magically rewind to around 1985 or so. The fervent belief that things can be reset shows the longing for the past where as Zman states, the country had an actual identity, not this current misshapen blob of globo-consumerism.

        Both the Russian Reset and healthcare initiatives were perfect examples of B. H. Obama’s failures. In both cases there were good practical reasons to seek a better relationship with Russia or a better delivery of healthcare to Americans. In both cases there were numerous examples of Obama’s ability to pronounce fine rhetoric. And in both cases there was a utter failure to deliver practical results.The current American problems with the Ukraine war can be traced to the incompetence of B. H. Obama’s regime. As for healthcare, for many Americans it remains an expensive burden, often unavailable to those of average means.

            It’s like “All Our Yesterdays” from the original Star Trek. A planet whose civilization lacks space flight capability has a sun that is about to go super-nova. Fortunately for them, they’ve developed the technology for time-travel, so the entire population has teleported themselves to their favorite periods from the planet’s history. The main point of this article is that there is an awareness across the political spectrum that we are headed in a bad direction, so people are looking to escape into our past.

                If I remember the episode correctly, The Atavachron — the Sarpeidon time portal  — wasn’t just for travelling back to a person’s favorite time period.  Zarabeth (Spock’s love interest in the episode) was banished to Sarpeidon’s ice age, five thousand years in the past. So the inhabitants of Sarpeidon also used the Atavachron as a sort of “time gulag.”

Best scene in that movie by far. Hollywood could still be self deprecating. Now every two-bit extra is as inflated as Bono. And that, is why it is so dangerous. You want to see a dangerous psychopath check out Bono and his sidekick gleefully funding and supporting an African invasion of Europe.
