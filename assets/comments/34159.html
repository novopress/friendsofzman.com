        I read an article on CNN today where the lead paragraph was, in summary “Trump was lying about egg prices dropping, but now they are dropping.” Of course, the media is the Enemy of the People and everything they say about the Trump presidency is part of their false narrative building. I also noticed the neocon rags tried to center Israel in its reporting on this trip, even though Trump explicitly pushed Israel to the side in a way that seems unprecedented. This speaks to both the strong headwinds that Trump faces as he tries to center America, and also the obvious improvement in competence compared to his first term.

It is striking. We may not live to see it fully realized, but the Israel-centric world of the last eighty years is going away now. The frenzied ethnic cleansing of Gaza indicated Israel knew the relationship was diminishing so a decision was made to finish the job. The calculation was right. It will be nice not to hear and read about Israel all of the time everywhere, won’t it?

                I think it’s breaking before our eyes. I enjoy a youngish streamer, Asmongold, who is quite the centrist. I even joked in the comment stream that he was more of a Boomer than I was. He’s quite popular and his content is as much political as gaming. (India has just announced him a national hero for his coverage of the Pak-India brouhaha.)
Even he rolls his eyes at the amount of Noticing he gets. He frequently has to warn his audience to lay off all the Noticing. Apparently nobody except him believes the Holo horsepuckey anymore.

                    It was real, it did happen, and it was awful. However, it was not unique. It was neither the first in the 20th Century (Armenians claim that “honor”) nor even the second (the Greeks in Turkey, then the Holodomor were #2, and #3). Off the top of my head I can add in no particular order: the Chinese in Indonesia and Malaya, the Ibo in Nigeria (Biafran Civil War), the Parsis in Zanzibar (why Freddy Mercury’s parents fled), the Rohingya in Burma, the Tibetans, the Uighurs, the Copts in Egypt, the Tutsis in Rwanda, the East Timoreans, the Cambodians, the Chinese in China during WWII, the Filipinos in WWII, and I am probably missing a few.Indeed technology including radio, semi auto rifles, and trucks allowed for the widespread use of genocide against peoples in way not seen before.Moreover the lessons were deliberately miscast. The idea that majority populations globally can be controlled and that ordinary White dudes were responsible were great lies. The real lesson is to have your own heavily armed country that includes nuclear weapons and ordinary people being heavily armed and trained.An example of the Arendt lies is that the movie “Zone of Interest” portrays the Camp Kommandant as an ordinary bureaucrat “just following orders” .. in reality he was a convicted murderer in Weimar who beat to death a suspected informant in the Black Forest. Ordinary Western peoples have large amounts of taboos about killing people, regimes from Stalin to the other Mustache Man had to recruit pyschopaths to do the killing, a good reason to eliminate said pyschopaths as a precaution for society. The events 1933-1945 contain many useful lessons but they are not the ones taught.

                        Thank you, brother, for the reply. You have been much on my mind, as we are the same in the most profound way. Please, my pen name, small “a”, alzaebo at yahoo email; just say ‘this is Whiskey,’ if you would.———————Genocide? No. Ethnic cleansing, you bet. But the lurid phantasms were no more than that, a true blood libel that cannot be reconciled with.Strongly agree that right rat-bastards were involved, as or more revolting to the conscience than the ones commiting atrocity on the Allied side. Both are hard to stomach, much less admit to.

                Our glorious future now means instead of having to hear about Israelis 24/7 we get to hear about Arabs all day long.  They’ll soon be here taking over swaths of the economy, undoubtedly accompanied by millions of Arab immigrants getting preferential loans and so forth.

                        People are more primed to go along with an Islamic POV now than they were before, by a long shot. And we all remember the quote about the strong horse. They could make some serious inroads into the American culture.

                        Indians and Armenians get preferential loans. They have special programs just for them  I’m sure others.  Arabs won’t be any different.  They’ll undoubtedly have banks opening up in America tied to the Saudi royals and/or wealth funds.

                            Armenians are white by U.S. Government assessment and do not qualify for preferential federal government loans.
Ashkenazi jews were recently assessed non-whites by the U.S. Government. Jews DO receive preferential federal loans as members of an official protected class.

            Not Israel so much as Netanyahu (or “The Man Who Should Have Resigned On October 8th”). Edan Alexander’s family thanked Trump and Witkoff for his release, not Netanyahu. Many believe he is simply prolonging the Gaza war to appease his Kahanist coalition partners (Ben Gvir and Smotrich) and cling to power – once out of office, he is looking at jail time for corruption charges.
Jews across the spectrum seem to be fed up with Netanyahu, Witkoff included. So I wouldn’t read Trump’s trip as a snub to Israel, but rather its current government.

                The Crusades held functional control of Jerusalem for about 88 years.
The post 1900 European movement into the same area appears to be on track to last roughly as long.
Establishing an alien colony in the middle of lands where you’re the vast minority means every roll of the dice has to come up 7.
(7 million vs about 400 million 1:55 …and it’s much greater if you consider the global population sympathetic to the recently displaced…15.8 million vs 2 billion)

                    Bibi is renowned for stirring up strife on the Temple Mount just before elections, presenting himself as the “War Leader”. As for IDF “stupefying unpreparedness” prior to October 7: very similar to 1973, when they got complacent about the Egyptians and Syrians and were nearly defeated. Thinking all Arabs are just inferior and stupid.

That didn’t really happen. Not that it wasn’t brutal, but it was exaggerated and there were a lot of friendly fire deaths from IDF.

        What was most striking about Trump’s remarks in Saudi Arabia was his acknowledgement of the failures of 21st century Neoconservative policies in the region. Ideas of nation building and democracy at the barrel of a gun were some of the worst self-inflicted injuries to American credibility. To see an American president point this out, to the regional powers no less, is something I did not expect to see in this lifetime.

        It was nice to hear the neoconservatives renounced in front of the Middle East and the entire world. Trump’s voice sounded more tired. The man is a force of nature, but these next four years are going to drain him bigly.America Inc. surviving isn’t an exciting prospect. Bringing back huge numbers of factories but importing a new people to work in them only makes Trump Biden who is helping to Finish the Job.Ideally, the leader will do what they never did, which is build a country out of a nation and address the serious civilizational problems. Like the manchildren who fritter their lives and energy away on the children’s games we call sports, the American Inc,man fritter a civilization away on maximizing profit and GDP while neglecting serious matters.Nobody is even acknowledging the race problems. Nobody is acknowledging the demographic problems. Nobody is acknowledging the cultural genocide. We are so afraid to tackle the issues that nobody will even use the proper terms.It won’t happen this way, but I would prefer a civilizational approach that exercises an iron will to undergo serious privation but deal with the problems root and branch.America Inc is not a business. Now that I think about it, it was always a colony. America Inc. is just a transnational’s colony. The sooner it can be destroyed and turned into a country the better. However, that will have to wait until balkanization and dissolution which will be long after we are gone. Build up the roots of that for your family and congregation in one of the now many movements underway. That is the only way to ensure a future for your progeny.

            ‘America Inc. is just a transnational’s colony.’Especially over the past few decades, with the financialization of everything.  What was the NAFTA ‘free trade’ agreement, if not a function of transnationalism?Recall how rapidly and uniformly the nations knelt before Godling Covid, as if directions arrived from a central source.  Also, how Transnational America uniformly sets up — often under force — copies of its own Diverse, Feminist, Hive self.The Book of Revelation has much to say concerning a certain time in human affairs when men of commerce come to rule the world, instead of kings and emperors.  It ends poorly.The king, at least you could throw down, and exterminate his family.  But what can you do to the great hydra of corporations?

        Best thing was he specifically called out the neocons for their murderous wars.Another big factor: Saudi Arabia’s population has increased from 8 million in 1975 to 38 million today, almost 5-fold, although a lot of those are foreign workers. As the antinatalist Europeans are finding out, you can’t have power without people.

                    And that is why these countries are going to face a major die-off, including Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s carrying capacity is around 1m. It has over thirty times that population, kept alive by oil revenues. As those revenues falter, subside, and flicker out, the population will crash to a more sustainable level. All efforts to “diversify the economy” have come a cropper. This population crash will occur throughout the Middle East. A textbook example of overshoot.

            “People” is too broad a term.  You can’t have power without smart, productive people.  Some call it the smart fraction.  By all accounts most native Saudis are not that.
America’s population has been growing relentlessly,  but  adding all these bodies isn’t making us more powerful.  It’s just making wealth distribution vastly more inequitable.  Every meztizo crossing inti the US makes this place a poorer, shittier country.

            Past populations and massive growth in them distort the historical narratives we’re all taught in tangible ways.
The entire Indian subcontinent had roughly 170 million people pre-British colonization.
It’s almost 1.5 billion in India alone now.  Many of them feel perfectly justified heading to the UK (population 67 million) to extract some payback.

        Trump’s effort is complicated by the fact that a huge portion of the Elite has gotten rich off of Globalism and resents his attempts to reform the broken system. For every Apple with the cash and profit margins to shift its supply chain to India/US and away from China, you have an Amazon (addicted to Chinese suppliers) or a Pfizer (subsidizes low prices outside the US with high US prices) for whom it’s going to be much more difficult. The massive Eurodollar market is an entire essay unto itself and the money men don’t want it to change either. In this regard, Trump’s effort reflects Turchin’s notion of Intra-Elite competition. This is why Larry Summers has been squealing like a pig.

            The old saying is the king always worries about the palace coup and the peasant revolt. In public government, the board of directors every once in a while needs a revolt by some of the board members in order to stave off a share holder revolt. That is what we have now. Some members of the board are staging a revolt because they correctly fear that management is leading the firm to a crisis and a share holder revolt.

They profit greatly from slave labor in China (Foxconn’s conditions are so bad they installed anti-deletion nets on the factory roofs to prevent workers from jumping off). But that will not last, China MUST transition from an export driven economy (vulnerable not just to the US imposing limits) to domestic consumption and they have ambitions to control the entire business chain also in foreign countries. Shein and Teemu are a threat to Wal Mart and Amazon and both know it. Musk faces threats from Geely and other Chinese Car companies. The US carrier fleet at the bottom of the ocean is very, very bad for Amazon and Wal Mart — it would mean the Chinese impose terms that threaten their supremacy for companies based in China and under Xi’s control.The Pharma people are not on board and getting punished with most favored nation pricing, Dems are being baited into siding with high drug prices and a message is being sent to Corporate America. On the flip side, energy companies seeking “safe” (under US protection) expansion can look at Greenland and Canada and possibly the UK as opportunities. And there are a host of connected Wall Street guys like Ackman who can make big profits from Government backed energy and manufacturing in the US.For me the take-away is that China threatens Musk and Bezos and the Waltons as much as the US Military Industrial Complex. The dog not barking is Bezos and Wal Mart demanding lower Chinese tariffs.

        It’s a bit off-topic from Z-man’s post today, but Donald Trump will have to make some important decisions on support for Ukraine in the next week or so, that will likely determine the fate of his Administration.  If he throws in with the neocons and the Europeans, places more sanctions on Russia and ships more weapons to Ukraine, his Administration is over, regardless of what he may do correctly in other areas, foreign and domestic.  I’m old enough to remember LBJ’s Administration.  He had ambitious domestic plans (mostly bad in my opinion, but that’s another comment), but it all came apart on Vietnam, because he could not simply walk away in 1965 when South Vietnam was on the edge of collapse.  Trump faces a similar dilemma this month.

                No. Trump’s actions are consistent with the USA Inc view of him. He saw Ukraine project as a bad investment by Biden that had to be recouped. So, he pushed for the mineral deal. At the same time, Russians told him (check Putin’s public comments) that they would invite Americans to extract minerals from the eastern Ukraine under Russian control. Russians indeed had a number of US JVs before the neocons destroyed everything. If Russia Inc takes over policing of the entire Ukraine and lets USA Inc extract minerals, that is a victory in Trump’s worldview.Remember Vietnam was a moral project, and a win of communists was seen as a loss of western morality. So, Johnson could not quit. Trump rejected such global moralizing projects in the Saudi speech yesterday.

        “In the case of empires, bankruptcy usually ends with the shareholders swinging from trees.”Immigration.We had some family up last week and I was arguing with my cousin’s husband. Standard stuff we talk about here, like JD’s wife being a dot head, which is why I couldn’t get behind him. Or whether Vivek ends up winning the governorship. (I’m not voting for him.) He doesn’t get why I’m not submitting to our new dot head overlords.Of course, he lives on the pasty white west side of Cincinnati and he’s a school teacher, so he doesn’t see what I see here. He doesn’t have to live with African and Asia dumped in his midst. He doesn’t see it so he doesn’t understand why some of us have gotten radicalized.But when times get tough and when you don’t have a homogeneous society, that’s when people turn on each other. It will be interesting to see if we ever get to that point.

Whenever an old home movie goes viral and kids see how people used to treat each other at McDonalds or whatever, they’re stunned at how friendly and sociable we used to be.
Those of us who lived through that decline and adapted to it along the way are less sensitive to it. The kids know everybody hates everybody. They’ve never felt anything else.

        Informative report, thanks.Trump is best at these Restructuring Corporate America gigs, and weakest at confronting cultural components like diversity, feminism and LGBTQ.  I suspect he’d have to overthrow his own household to accomplish that.He showed in his first term that economic/international matters was his strength, hardly surprising given his Making Big Deals career.  His USAID strike was a fine beginning, but DEI has barely been touched throughout the culture, ruling unchallenged, and the strike now begins to appear calculated for the base and mostly performative.  How can his appointees crush Diversity Inc. when they themselves are Diverse?Also, I see no butts in jail.  He wants to turn the country around? ok let’s see accountability, and that means powerful butts in jail of the most egregious offenders of past decades.  Attempts to injure the population and ruin the country must be punished.  Think Fauci, then let your mind wander.

        “In reality it is a glimpse of how the large share owners of America Inc. are restructuring the company.”Contrast Saudi relations with Pres. Trump with Saudi interaction with the Biden administration.The Saudi Arabians, like many other countries, have a set-scene for a state photo shoot for visiting dignitaries. Presumably the purpose is to build diplomatic good will by giving the foreign dignitary something to remember their visit. It looks very elegant, with tapestries on the wall behind two finely crafted chairs (an expression of their traditional artisanal culture) each of which has a state flag adjacent. The photographer’s point of view sees the Saudi dignitary seated on the right with the Saudi flag slightly offset, and the visiting dignitary seated on the left, with his country-flag slightly offset.The nebbish Anthony Blinken visited Saudi Arabia several years back when he was Secretary of State and had the ritual state photo shoot. However, the Saudis somehow didn’t put out an American flag. The visitor’s pole was empty. I suppose if one desperately wants to avoid the truth one could hypothesize that their American flag got too tattered and the Saudi oil sheiks ran out of money to buy another copy from China. However, the true explanation is that this was non-verbal communication. The Saudis were saying “Anthony Blinken is no American” and “The America with which we signed a strategic partnership with 70 years ago is no more.”Pres. Trump and the oligarchs behind are trying to reestablish the deal, attempting to put out the perception that while America was down, it is now back. Will it work? I hope not. If one’s European country needs an infusion of cash from Islamics to stay afloat (and to keep Jewish transnational merchants afloat), then it is not a European country anymore and the Europeans within need to end it and get a new country of their own with no dependencies on either Islamics or Jews. Too late was a long time ago.

        “…the Saudis need to adapt. They cannot continue to be a gas station in the desert. They need to diversify.”This bears watching.  Can the Saudis “diversify” as a “nation”?  This begs the question, “What is a nation?”  My go to answer has always been, “A nation is its people.”The Saudis until now have bought whatever it was that its native stock could not produce, which was everything.  Such includes millions of foreign workers “imported” to do the dirty work required to keep those things running.My suspicion is that “investment” in America will not change such.  It will simply produce at best a secondary income stream outside of hydrocarbons in order to continue the party.  Can it last?  Can Saudi Arabia continue to grow as a nation that does nothing to support/expand itself, but only hires out the dirty work of development to others?  Has there ever been such a nation state?

            The oil sheiks are all trying to find some investment that will allow the money spigot to continue with the least amount of work (i.e., tourism staffed by an army of foreigners working under slave-like conditions).  The only true wealth though comes from either resource extraction or turning those resources into something.  They’d be better off investing in a giant hole in the earth’s crust that would allow them to get at the smoking hot goodies inside.

They are and their leaders know it. But what would you have them do? Their population has an IQ of around 85 or even lower. That can’t be changed.

                        Good point.  You can’t change the population’s IQ, so you place your bets on keeping the lid on the whole thing.  However, like our national debt, the party can’t keep going indefinitely.  As someone pointed to above, the immense population explosion in Saudi Arabia seems to indicate that what was possible in the 1970’s is difficult to imagine recurring today.  No everybody can live on the dole.

            “They need to diversify”
They’ve tried. They’ve failed. Attempts at agriculture have come a cropper. Now they’re trying to build a replica of Dubai. But that too will come a cropper and Dubai itself will not succeed. All they have is the black gold. The curse of the black gold — without it, Saudi population would not have increased from 1m to 33m.

        I am still not clear as to how much the oligarchs are backing the financial restructuring vs backing Trump backing Israel. It seems to be a mixed bag. It would be interesting to see the demographic breakdown of the oligarchs and their support for Trump. My hypothesis is that many of the goys are backing the economic while the tribe oligarchs are more concerned with Israel. But that hypothesis could be like most hypotheses: wrong.

                            They didn’t. The Italians did, looking to expand their empire. When they faltered, the fuhrer sent a token force to assist in the failing project. It’s arguable that WW2 Italy was the worst ally in the history of allies, accomplishing precisely zero without German support, which drained German efforts elsewhere. But that’s another subject. Although possibly analogous in some ways.

                                I remember reading in one of the books I was assigned at the Naval War College that German net assessers before the start of World War II had concluded that Germany would benefit most by Italian neutrality, not belligerance.  The success of theAfrika Korpsin north Africa was a bit of a fluke.  The one country that stayed neutral that Gemany would have liked to have entered the war on their side was Franco’s Spain.

                                If the Italians hadn’t suddenly needed the Germans to come save them- I think it was in Sardinia?- then Operation Barbarossa would’ve been a success, as the Germans would not have been sidetracked until Mr. Winter showed up.
The War would’ve been over, and the USSR would’ve been saved. United Europe might’ve been the hegemon, and not the US.

                                    Greece you’re thinking of, another place the Italians invaded and got bogged down until the Germans came to help. Which delayed Barbarossa. Whether or not Barbarossa would have succeeded otherwise, I dunno, opinions vary, but I kinda doubt it. The main problem with Barbarossa was one side had zero margin for error, and the other side had a huge margin.

                                “The Italians did, looking to expand their empire.”
What a bunch of losers. That “new Roman empire” lasted all of five years. In the space of 18 months Italy went from being considered by the Germans as a near-equal to being considered a junior partner. When the Greeks surrendered, they insisted on surrendering to the Germans rather than the Italians. Italy posing as a great power in the late 1930s has to be the joke of the 20th century.

                                    Mussolini’s involvement in WWII was a miscalculation. He thought the German victory in France meant the war was almost over and he needed to declare war to get in on the peace negotiations (and the swag). Meanwhile, the Italian army was equipped with WWI weapons and no tanks, the main weapon of offensive warfare, esp. in North Africa.

                            Yup. I wonder if we should call it the Railroad War instead of an extended oil war, as Britain, France, and Germany scrambled to lay rail lines between the oil, mining, and port sites. Even in WWII Germany’s domestic main transport was draft horse carts away from the rail depots.
Used WWII vehicles are what began the trucking and lorry industry after the war, and pipeline routes replaced much of the rail tankers.

                        Well, remember today’s map was forged in the Great Game, the race for oil as industrial nations converted their navies and industry from coal. Germany and Britain were in direct competition over railroad lines to those oil-rich regions.Germany agreed to help the Roths push settlers into Palestine, as it was then called, who didn’t really want to go. Thus the scare and victimization campaign. Britain also cooperated even during the war years in the Havarra Transfer agreement, though it had few takers. France got Syria and Lebanon. Lawrence got the Arabs, and Britain the Mandate. The Empires were being carved up and re-formed.Of course, Germany (and Britain) were thanked in the traditional fashion by the Betrayers. Now Israel is fighting to maintain its reason for existing as a replacement to Persia as the key link in the New Silk Road.

        Maybe we should have more vigorously pursued coal as fuel (of which we have plenty), so as not to have to make deals with the sand people to keep our empire solvent. Of course, the fallacy in that is AINO itself receives hardly any middle eastern oil. But its imperial interests do, so it is forced to supplicate to the bedouins in an effort to prop up its fading empire, which it didn’t need to begin with!, having as it does the greatest combination of geographic security and resource wealth the world has ever known. But that wasn’t enough for some people.Black gold aside, the sand people are some of the few remaining who both still have money, and are still willing to invest it in AINO, and that is the state of the GAE, that it can no longer stand up without seeking foreign investment.

        Keir Starmer, fresh off being caught with Macron and Merz doing a white powder on the Z train to Keeeeevvvvvvv has given a speech “Nation of Strangers” decrying immigration and multiculturalism while his government has literally sentenced young mothers to years in prison for sayign the same thing.He is not scared of Reform / Farage. The key feature of democracies from Thailand, to Malaysia, to Turkey, to Russia, to Romania, to Germany, France, and the US is imprisoning popular rivals through Lawfare and facade of reasonableness to stave off any real challenge. The only reason Orange Man Bad is not in jail and President Biden is not shuffled around in a wheelchair is that the Color Orange (should be a sequel to Speilberg’s Color Purple) had too many important oligarchs and the military industrial complex on his side.I think Starmer instead is trying to use Orange-face to get succor from the Orange Man Bad. He’s not afraid of the populace, he can just jail and/or draft them all. He’s not afraid of Farage. He is afraid that his party is getting Great Replaced by Muslim MPs, but more directly (since he can have them arrested) he is afraid of a coup. He’s pissed off Putin, no end, and Putin’s play is to forment a coup that is already rising. By MI5’s own reporting they were keeping track of over 60K potential “t-words” and with Russian support that becomes reality. Starmer wants/needs US troops and himself to be part of the US clientele. Macron and Merz and the others are too white powdered up to figure this out; Comrade Starmer like the good Stalinist he is can understand that threat.

        I’m not at all convinced that foreign investment is a good idea.
After some deal Clinton worked out, I had a client in ’94 or so who was considering Saudi investment. Buried way deep in the fine print was that after 20 years, the property came under the sole ownership of Saudis, including IP, but vastly worse for the long term was that the Saudis instantly gained standing in our courts. Saudis for whom bribery is a way of life.

        Let’s hope Trump succeeds, but that is not a certainty. In fact, it’s a long shot because change is now happening at hyperspeed and complexity is fomenting uncertainty. The US &amp; West are drowning in debt and swimming in the treacherous waters of massive illegal invasions. We now lack social cohesion and robustness, and it won’t take much to start internal wars of conquest. Europe cannot defend itself and the US citizenry is armed to the teeth.

                Usually, we do, but not always. Bahrain had very nice air conditioned hangars with floors that made some U.S. clean rooms look like pig stys in comparison. Kuwait has most of theirs air conditioned, but the Saudis often do not.After pulling duty with the Air National Guard in Iraq and Kuwait, I really didn’t want to go back, but it was much better than the accommodations provided by Uncle Sam.The worst of it was that the Bahrainis had several different mods to the aircraft we were retrofitting with new radars, targeting pods, databuses on the pylons so they could hang new ordnance and large cockpit displays that required you to take out the ejection seat and then remove the cockpit.No two of these F-16s were identical due to constant retrofits, so we had to draft new schematics, go through the change orders and it was a mess. The Bahrainis were great help, and they do a great job maintaining their aircraft, but they were just as frustrated as we were.We eventually got the job done, got a great reception from the commander of their air force and all of us left a lot richer than we were before.

For me, it’s pretty amazing how much you can put up with between the salary adjustments and tax benefits if you stay abroad 11 of 12 months. Also, there is no better feeling than flying business class on the company’s or customer’s dime.

                That flight from Bahrain to Atlanta is a bastard, so being in business class definitely helps. All I remember was I worked 18 hour days 5-6 days a week for nearly a year and slept almost the entire flight back.

            Just checked ChatGPT.  The temp here (Tucson, AZ) in summer is similar to Bahrain.  In winter, so are the highs, but we get slightly lower lows.  Last year we had 110 days of 100+ degree heat.  Your problem in Bahrain seems to be humidity from the ocean.  That is a bitch everywhere.  We have it as well, but only during the rainy season for few months.  You have my sympathy.

        “The Saudis are not going to plow their profits into treasuries, but into direct investments in the United States”Mostly agree with your post. Note that the Saudis and everyone else who has invested in US treasuries have been losing purchasing power because of the large difference between the interest afforded on the T-bills and the real inflation rate. In addition other countries can now offer military protection and defence systems that are at least as good (if not far better) than anything the US has. The US is not the only game in town anymore.This is what losing hegemony means. Interesting to see how US grand strategy is changing to keep abreast of the times.There’s an insightful video by a Chinese fellow here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNAvxvCvM68

This guy argues that the petrodollar concept is not real. It is promoted by media to distract from the “eurodollar” market.
I agree with the larger point made by Zman in his post regarding restructuring of USA Inc.

        Saudis were really unhappy with Joe Biden and joined BRICS and even became friends with Iran under a Chinese-brokered deal. Also, Saudi-TV made these videos to mock Biden –

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1uiLNY9Nro
It looks like they welcome sanity return to USA.
Also, Saudis own a part of  twitter. The investor prince made some complaining noise after Elon’s initial proposal, but since joined him as a co-investor.

                If we take BRICS it at its word, the “normalcy” it seeks is worldwide white subjugation forever as righteous revenge for colonialism, with America as prime symbolic sacrifice.
I mean, they put out press releases, studies, position papers, etc. Nobody reads them, but they dointendthem.
BRICS is Russia and China putting the West’s own call for “Global South” vengeance to ironic use.
Why miss the joke?

        Remember what we said earlier about sin and free will. But if it is too difficult to commit it all to memory, hold this brief summary in mind. Whatever the cause of the will might be, if the will cannot resist it, it is no sin to yield to it; but if the will can resist it, let it do so, and there will be no sin. What if the cause of the will deceives the will and catches it off guard? Then let the will guard against deception. What if the deception is so great that the will cannot guard against it? Then there is no sin, for who sins by doing what he cannot guard against? But there is sin, so it is possible to guard against it.…And it is no wonder that because of our ignorance we lack the free choice of the will to choose to act rightly, or that even when we do see what is right and will to do it, we cannot do it because of the resistance of carnal habit, which develops almost naturally because of the unruliness of our mortal inheritance. It is indeed the most just penalty for sin that we should lose what we were unwilling to use well, since we could have used it well without the slightest difficulty if only we had willed to do so; thus we who knew what was right but did not do it lost the knowledge of what is right, and we who had the power but not the will to act rightly lost the power even when we have the will.

        It has been fascinating to watch the way Trump has become the right wing Obama, where all he needs to do is pitch hot air and let the cult of Trump provide a smokescreen for his constant bullshitting without delivering results. He got completely manhandled by the CCP over the tariff business, and yet I’ve already seen a dozen articles about how it is MAGA to make it seem like America has put another unreliable, senile old man who capitulates in the big chair.At this point it is becoming clear that Musk was the brains behind the high quality first 90 days of the administration, with how thick he was with Trump during the lead up to the inauguration. Ever since Musk stepped back we have been back to the old “all hat no cattle” Trump of the first term. Anyone who isnt betting on the “failed experiment” outcome after watching this tariff fiasco is a fool.

            Tariffs on China before Trump were about 3%. They likely will be about 25 to 40%, with some exceeding that. The days of China dumping stuff in the US market is over. That is not being manhandled.Trump is just the figurehead, the real power behind him is the combination of the Military Industrial Complex which understands the luxury boutique warfighting Global War on Terror model died in Ukraine, with its mass mobilization and critically, Russian air defense systems, and Oligarchs who understand they are next on the Chinese menu.Already you see in Youtube videos “Chinesium” and “Indianum” used as a generic term for cheap, and bad, imported parts for autos, and other stuff. This is shared also by powerful institutions that see China as a threat. If Jack Ma went to prison, what chance do they have?

                Chinesium has been around for decades at this point, at least. The Trump administration caved the second Asia started playing hard ball on the bond market, and they will cave again once the 90 days are up in the same way since they have to deal with the time bomb left for them by Yellen.

Thinking that Trump 2.0 actually has a plan after this farce is pure Qanon shit, but apparently that is a popular flavor of Kool-aid around here.

            what fiasco?  Trump levied tariffs.  China retaliated.  Trump raises tariffs to 145%.  China drops the retaliatory tariffs, and Trumps goes back to the Liberation Day reciprocity baseline.
Y’all are trying too hard and come off sounding like idiots.
Trump said from the beginning “details lists, and you get punched in the teeth”.  That’s what happened, and China was forced to agree to drop their retaliation.
