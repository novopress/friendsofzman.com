        Native Texan here.  I think that you are mostly right about our views on culture, being a Texan and immigration.  But I want to point out that while there are xenophobic some nuts who hate everyone not like them (and many of them aren’t white, btw) most Texans who don’t like immigration don’t like it because many illegal immigrants come here to suck up our benefits.  Walk through a Texas high school and take a survey of how many students were born south of the Rio Grande.  My guess is 40% in most schools that aren’t ultra-pricey suburbs.  And it is irksome to be in line at the grocery store behind someone who doesn’t speak English who has $200 worth of groceries and is paying with a Texas state benefits card.  My ancestors came from Germany in the 1870s and worked hard from the day they got here.  They were way too proud to take Welfare in any form even though they needed it more than many of the modern immigrants do.  That is a big part of why some of us don’t like the flood of immigration that we are seeing.

        Eros Guy, I think a cultural explosion is the desired end state.

        I hope you’re right. I lived in California in the 1960s. I’ve lived near everywhere in Texas: Del Rio, Lubbock, Houston, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth. The last few years have felt like California in 1963. The massive increase in population will provoke some kind of cultural explosion. Not sure what kind, but I hope it involves more nuclear power and more dams. Texas needs power and water to live.

        I’m old enough to remember a California a lot like that. If you get outside the pinche West Side, San Fran, Marin, and Santa Barbara, it’s my Chinese, Persian, Indian, and Mexican friends who seem to have the most of the old spirit.

        God bless Texas!
That blender by the way, as you so politely put it, the human extinction movement, they are trying to turn it into a cultural meat grinder.
As they say in Texas, Come and Take It.I’m working my way towards that ethereal void also.Still have a lick of letsgo in me before I leave this plain.I hope I have the opportunity to acquit myself well and take a few of the sonofabitches with me when I do.

        Most of Texas frequented by visitors is not scenic but if you stay out of the cities, you can avoid  the nanny state and live the way you want (for the most part).  Most Texans including me thought nothing about the illegal aliens up to a few years ago because the idea that they could change the culture of Texas did not come to mind.  This all changed recently with the implosion of California.

        Not only all that, but when you move there, native Texans greet you like you’re a long lost cousin. At least they did when I spent a few years in San Antonio in the ’50s.

        All true.   I lived in Dallas for 9 years and one of the first thing that hits you besides the flat ugliness of the landscape, is the state pride.  I’ve lived in 5 states and none of the others exhibit that pride. Most of Texas is not pretty but it doesn’t matter, it’s all loved.  Not only the poor from Mexico come, many wealthy Mexicans have homes in Texas and Mexico.  The high-end stores and hotels in Dallas are packed on Mexican holidays.  As Lyle Lovett penned: that’s right, you’re not from Texas, Texas loves you anyway.
