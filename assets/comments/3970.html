        […] slows down Iran’s quest for a nuclear weapon and lifts the sanctions on them. The fact that every energy firm on earth is lining up to make a deal with the mullahs says the sanctions are sure to be lifted, no matter what Iran does or does not do. Western […]

        In the UK, the left-leaners (aka the Labour Party members) who fall foul of the law usually end up in hot water because of money. The Tories, who supposedly have money (or rather, they have ‘old’ money which appears to come with some sort of easy-going acceptance and sensibility) tend to get into sexual scrapes.Profumo, the disgraced Tory Secretary of State for War minister in the 60s, was one casualty on the right and John Stonehouse, the Labour government’s Postmaster General — who was eventually revealed as a Czech spy — is remembered here for attempting to fake his own death when financial irregularities in his business interests came under investigation.The rule of thumb here is while the Tories go crazy for sex antics, socialists are obsessed not only with other people’s money but grabbing what they can for themselves.

        I don’t think that it’s really “progressive sexually morality.”  More like traditional Shia amorality gone wild.  The way it works is this.  You and the zaftig divorcee down the street go see the mullah.  No one would ever tell me what the mullah’s rake was, but he would get a percentage of the gross.  He would say “halal tukhi” (“it is allowed”) three times and you and the divorcee would go do whatever you paid for (this can range from a one night stand to something more long term, apparently).  The one thing that everyone violently agreed on was this was for widows and divorcees only.  Virgins (loosely defined as a woman never yet married) were not eligible.  The “theology” (I’ve read up on this) behind this is that it is better for a husbandless woman to do a little in-call with someone in the congregation than to be walking the streets to support herself and her kids. Apparently the Muslim idea that sex is some uncontrollable urge (especially in the female) is tied up in this somehow. I think the reason that this has gone wild is that the mullahs have a very powerful incentive to become pimps. Everyone else just wants to screw with abandon like they all believe (and believe me they all believe) that everyone in the West does.  In a way, the denizens in the Shia crescent are just living the sexual revolution (and attendant divorce wave) of the 60’s and 70’s within their own peculiar cultural and religious boundaries.

        It’s cultural Marxism on top of fascism/crony capitalism.
“We won the cold war with political and economic communism, but we lost the cultural war with cultural Marxism, which i think has prevailed in the United States and is now the dominant culture.”– Pat Buchanan

        What we have in the Anglosphere is the progressive left, a much different creature than the communist left, although the two are closely related and easily confused. The progressive left doesn’t like global capitalism, it *is* global capitalism for all intents and purposes. It’s the public and private religion of English and Dutch Calvinist merchants.The progressive left doesn’t support the communist left because it is communist or particularly likes communism, it does it because communist movements are a great way to clear away traditional elites not interested in participating in global capitalism. No Protestant country, except for East Germany, ever went communist, nor did any former English colony, except those that became white-ruled independent countries first.If one believes Spengler/David Goldman, Iran has been pretty much destroyed by progressive sexual morality already, and the formal theocracy is meaningless.

            If one believes Spengler/David Goldman, Iran has been pretty much destroyed by progressive sexual morality already, and the formal theocracy is meaningless.Iran is at least two countries within the Persian population. One is the theocratic/Islamic country with a base of support in the rural areas and the nomenklatura. The other portion is a cynical, urban class that is anti-clerical, but superficially Western and modern. The former has the guns, while the later has numbers. But, demographics favor the former, in the long run.My read on the Obama initiative is that it is just a money grab, for the most part. That and some nutty ideas about re-aligning with Iran against the Saudis and Israelis.
