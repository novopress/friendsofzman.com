        “The elites running it naturally have little reason to be loyal to Britain or any other country in which they operate. Like their company, they are citizens of the world, which is a polite way of saying citizens of nowhere.”
Actually, they are capitalists who are trying to make some coin.

        Much of the modern economy is simply socializing costs and privatizing profits with the former falling on the middle-class and the latter bubbling up to the elites.

        Nietzsche-They are rid of the Christian God and now believe all the more firmly that they must cling to Christian morality. That is an English consistency; we do not wish to hold it against little moralistic females a la Eliot. In England one must rehabilitate oneself after every little emancipation from theology by showing in a veritably awe-inspiring manner what a moral fanatic one is. That is the penance they pay there…We others hold otherwise. When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one’s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident: this point has to be exhibited again and again, despite the English flatheads. Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one’s hands.

        The struggle between the people and the hatred amongst them is being nurtured by very specific interested parties. It is a small, rootless, international clique that is turning the people against each other and does not want them to have peace.It is the people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere. Those who do not have anywhere a soil on which they have grown up. Rather they live in Berlin today, Brussels tomorrow, Paris the day after that, and then again in Prague or Vienna or London. They feel at home everywhere. They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements because they conduct their business everywhere.But the people cannot follow them. The people are bounded to their soil, bounded to their fatherland, bounded to the possibilities of life that the state, the nation, offers.

        The elites are not us because they aren’t racist, sexist, homophobic, gun loving, xenophobic, sexually uptight, religious nuts.  Or to put it another way, they aren’t us because they don’t sin and we do.  We may not want to admit it any more than they do, but it really is all about our fallibility.  Some of us recognize it and submit to God, some of us don’t and think we are a god.

        Wow, you hit the invisible nail on the head with this one.  I knew something was afoot but couldn’t get it quite in focus but you did.  Like any 12 step program, the first move is to recognize you have a problem and you just diagnosed it.  Nice work.

        Well said.However while Al-beeb is the development of both socialism and the desire to nurture a collective guilt, imposing liberally as I have said before a tax that everyone must pay: if the muscle-men of the Corporation think you are in possession of an unlicensed  ‘television receiver’ you can go to jail. (An aside here; my daughter got a TV licence when she first went to university but it was delivered to the wrong address. The Beeb’s response to her enquiry was to send her a warning letter that on no account must she attempt to watch her TV until she had retrieved the licence from where it had been sent. Yes, she/we had paid but they thought it better to threaten her for their error.)You also have to look at two things here as well. First is the fact that the man promoting non-terrorist love and understanding is, er, of Middle east stock. His loyalties may well lie more with the lunatic regimes and weird religious practices over there rather than in the UK.Be that as it may, the second thing is the story was run by a friend of Al-Beeb in the shape of a jaded rag called The Independent (or as Private Eye, the long-standing satirical if rather neutered magazine here used to name it: The Indescribablyboring). The Independent likes stories like this.The Independent, if you are not aware, is heavy on left opinion and light on news. They have given over their front pages to frothing opinion pieces about things they don’t know much about. While The Guardian avoids being nakedly opinionated on its front page most of the time, it holds the peak position in the lefty ‘newspaper’ market and The Indy lags behind, so it tries hard to be as outrageously stupid as it can be.It was the Indy that published the now-famously laughable news story in 2000 that wailed that global warming meant children in the UK would never see snow again. I try not to think of this when I am digging my car out of the white stuff.The Beeb is awful in all sorts of ways — though we may say it is mostly the least worst television in the world, mostly due to its wildlife documentary tradition — and the truth is that if it were not for the heavy hand of the state forcing us all to pay then it wouldn’t survive other than as a fringe station showing seagulls raising their young.Rags like the Indy and broadcaster like the Beeb love the elite who have trampled on so much of the UK (though not on the seagulls, of course, basking in the endless summers we now endure) and yes, they would prefer us to be the shapeless mass ready to follow the EU’s diktats. Sadly, while there are still some who resist this, Orwell could see it coming and he made it clear the answer is more big fist lovingly reported in the thoughtless rags.A big fisting, some might say.
