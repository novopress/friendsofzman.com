        @goyThese men who “feel” they’re women don’t think like women. Their attempts to interact with women are hilarious, because they don’t understand the way women think and communicate. They really, literally, demonstrably do not have women’s minds. Even when they get themselves castrated and have female hormones injected, they still don’t think like women.They are not in fact women in men’s bodies. They’re men who want to have tits and a vagina.It’s sad. Life can be sad. But they really are crazy. If only the most subtle and experienced shrinks can tell which ones are batshit crazy and which have “female minds” in some objectively non-quantifiable sense that nobody can measure, then the shrinks are kidding themselves. If it’s real, it’s measurable. If it’s a subjective “feel” thing, how do they calibrate it? Will two sufficiently subtle shrinks always reach the same conclusion, when operating in isolation? If they disagree, which one gets disqualified? Do they follow case herstories to check their work?If my own (obvious, I bet) answer to any of those rhetorical questions is wrong, please let me know where to go to see the evidence.

        “You still can’t judge someone who…”
I wrote “judge the motives”, which is a very, very different thing. So, no, not “wrong”.
“Behaving” and “doing” are the same.
And, no one can not make judgments on *motives* based solely on how someone else behaves.
This thing called “life” doesn’t give you clairvoyance.

        Goy: “Bottom line: if you haven’t survived a genuine suicide attempt, then you can not possibly judge the motives of someone who has committed suicide. ”
Nope, wrong. You still can’t judge someone who succeeded in comitting suicide because, er, they were successful. Those still alive weren’t.
Playfully imagining how someone ‘feels’ is just a game. Seeing how they really behave and what they do, rather than what they say or shout, allows you to make judgements.
See how this thing called life works?

        “Humans are either male or female and that’s determined by genetics.”If only it were that simple.The issue and conflict here is caused primarily by the difference between genotype, i.e., what makes us US, and phenotype, what we and others MAKE OF US.Genotype is binary/digital and, yes, absolutely determined by genetics (with rare exceptions like 46xxy, etc.).Phenotype is analog/spectral and, no, not necessarily determined completely by genetics but, rather, affected by hormonal and other intra-uterine conditions – like drug abuse, poorly-tested pharmaceuticals like DES, etc. – during gestation. These non-genetic factors during pregnancy determine the formation of sex organs, brain structure (i.e., specialization into male or female brain – yes, fMRI shows that there are differences) and the other things that control how humans perceive themselves and/or appear or behave with respect to gender.The massive confusion around this issue is that no one really recognizes, much less understands this difference between these two largely orthogonal elements of identity (hell, scientists barely understand it).This is particularly true of the minority, militant faction of the transgender “community”, which has taken its lead from the gay/lesbian mafia in terms of using victim status to demand social engineering aimed at forcing everyone to adjust their behavior to accomodate their self-identified gender. The problem is that, yes, in some cases this dysphoria can be caused by mental illness; only extensive genetic, medical and psychological assessment and analysis can determine this, and very few health care professionals have the first clue how to deal with it. The result is that the condition is treated in a manner similar to homosexuality, despite the fact that gender and sexual preference are completely orthogonal. That is, it is taken for granted that the individual’s gender expression is “valid” when, for a variety of reasons, it may not be.The inclination, as is always the case where ignorance prevails, is to revert to tribal behavior. That’s where this phenomenon comes from – it’s an attack by one tribe against another in a conflict driven by the fact that neither side really understands the issue. One side feels – and likely is – perfectly justified in being fearful of the unknown; the other side feels – and often is – victimized as a result of that fear. This is further compounded, of course, by the cultural Marxists who seek to leverage any available social conflict, transforming it into a case of Western Civilization vs. some new victim group.Bottom line: if you haven’t survived a genuine suicide attempt, then you can not possibly judge the motives of someone who has committed suicide. Similarly, if you haven’t experienced the overwhelming certainty that you are NOT the gender that your physical body tells you you are, then you can not possibly judge the motives or mental status of someone who has experienced it.If there were more effort to research and understand that dysphoria, instead of reacting based on unearned assumptions regarding the motivation for or cause of it, the militant reaction like the one discussed here would not only be reduced, but could be far more widely condemned.

        I work directly across from a Tranny bar. I see the cross dressers, the transvestites, and the transsexuals in their various states of surgical and hormonal creation. I’ve talked to a few– all transsexuals–because they won’t let you ignore them. They are aggressive in insisting that strangers accept their state as women, and as beguiling women. It is necessary to become rude to cut them off. Nothing else ever worked for me.I once worked, long ago, for two years in a heavily homosexual environment. Most of those men are dead. People who cling to the idea that homosexual men are just like everybody except for the sexual orientation are either cowards or lazy. Homosexual men, however they portray themselves to the public, do not think they are like “breeders” and do not wish to be like them.The inability to discriminate leads to the inability to be discriminating. Homosexuality is a disorder, one of nature’s many, but Tranny’s make the gay scene look like Ozzie and Harriet.

        If ‘transphobia’ is perfectly normal and natural, it is NOT a phobia.

        I saw ‘Monty Pythons – Live Mostly’ final show on Saturday night at Dartmouth…
My professor brother-in-law, who was with us, said that the most famous bit – The Lumberjack Song – would get you fired today at virtually every American university.

The 1A does not give you the right to ruin a man’s business or interfere in his private contracts. If all these people were doing is voicing an opinion, no one would complain. That’s not what they are doing. They are threatening a business with material harm unless that business complies with their demands. It looks more like extortion than the exercising of rights.
