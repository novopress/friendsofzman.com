        I would just add that live baseball is now a luxury product. No working man can afford to take the wife and kids to the park to see a game. Gone are the days of $3 bleacher tickets and $1 cold National Bohemian at Memorial Stadium. Parking alone is $40 at Yankee Stadium. Bankers feast on $30 crab cakes at Camden Yards.

            If you have a local minor league team it‚Äôs not too bad. Our local team sells lawn tickets in the outfield starting at $13 (bring your own blanket or chairs) and topping out at $32 in the stands. They often do ‚ÄúThirsty Thursday‚Äù nights with reduced priced beer, a $1 menu night (hot dogs, popcorn, pretzels, soda, water), and often run ‚ÄúKids Eat Free‚Äù games on a Sunday afternoon.
I just don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs all non-cash.

                Do they blare nonstop rap over the loudspeakers? To my mind, this is the most gratuitously offensive aspect of modern sports.

                    Well since the local Cineplex charges $12.99 for a movie ticket to goodness knows what remake or reboot, it‚Äôs not out of line.

                Pawtucket Rhode Island had a guy named Ben Mondor who saved the team in 1977 from bankruptcy and made McCoy Stadium one of the most family-friendly, lovely places to visit for over 35 years. Very cheap tickets and a beautiful evening in a city that was (and still is, obviously) dead.Larry Luciano of the Boston Red Sox salivated over that AAA team for years, and when Mondor died, circled around Ben‚Äôs widow until she finally relented. Now the team is in Worcester, MA, attendance is dismal, prices are absurdly high for the product on the field, and Luciano is dead. There is already talk in the Worcester business community that a NEW STADIUM might be needed in less than a decade.

                    First off you KNOW I‚Äôm gonna ask: Did they serve Pawtucket Patriot beer at McCoy Stadium? (Laughs like Peter Griffin)Secondly, sorry to hear a greedy bastard ruined a local treasure. Seems to happen a lot these days.Finally your team sucks, nobody attends games, tickets and concessions are absurdly expensive, AND you want a new stadium? Who in the Hell do these jokers think they are, the Chicago White Sox?(As of this post the White Sox have not won 30 games THE ENTIRE SEASON. But yeah, a new stadium on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime will fix things up right quick. üôÑ)Signed, Former White Sox fan. Just move to Tennessee and be done with it. üòí

                        It was great while it lasted. It coincided with the spirit of American culture from the 70s through the 1990s. I remember a night game in the late 90s there that was like a little bit of heaven. Hard to believe it ever happened, honestly, given the state of affairs.
It‚Äôs funny that Family Guy refers to Pawtucket. I‚Äôve never watched it. I hope they pronounce it correctly. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúPUH-tuck-it.‚Äù

            So much has changed.  If you look at photos of baseball crowds from the first half of the 20th century, almost everyone is nicely dressed.  The men, including working class guys, are almost all in what would today be called dress shirts.  Many in the earlier 1900‚Äôs are wearing suits and ties.
Then there‚Äôs how much thinner everyone was‚Äìplayers and fans.  It‚Äôs really shocking.

            It corrupts the game implicitly even when it doesn‚Äôt do so explicitly. Because now that the betting line is common knowledge, whereas before it wasn‚Äôt, it is in the head of every player and coach, which corrupts the game even when they haven‚Äôt bet on it or taken any money themselves. That‚Äôs before we get into the explicit corruption, always present, all the way back to the Black Sox, probably all the way back to injuns playing their brand of lacrosse, but you‚Äôd have to be naive to believe it isn‚Äôt increasing in proportion to the increased dollar amounts being wagered.

                There are plenty of examples where betting has influenced game outcomes.
My favorite was an obvious interception at the end of a Steelers game several years ago.
The interception was by the refs overturned on replay.
The ultimate result was that $120 million in bets swung back to the house in Vegas.
Nope, nothing to see here folks.

                    As just one example, a coach may leave a pitcher in longer than he should or might play injured players.  He might rest his overworked closer when he doesn‚Äôt have a bet down.  Not nearly as blatant as betting against your team, but still altering strategy and outcomes.

                    In baseball, you‚Äôre trying to win 2 out of 3. Nobody goes undefeated. Sometimes, when you‚Äôre way behind in a game, as a manager you just accept the loss (from a strategy perspective), so as to save your bullpen for tomorrow. But if you bet on your team to win, then tomorrow doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. You might use your whole pitching staff in an effort to win your bet. And then none of them are any good tomorrow.
Also, you can‚Äôt get a little bit pregnant

                This is totally different than what gambling was in the past.  Gamblers used to just bet on a team to win or lose with a point spread and the total points.  Now they have all kinds of prop bets on different aspects of the game.  You can bet the over/under individual stats for every player.  Here is a story about Jontay Porter who was a marginal NBA player banned for life for fixing the bets on his individual stat line by faking injuries. A problem like this was easy to anticipate, yet the leagues and the gambling companies are too greedy to make any changes to prevent it.https://apnews.com/article/nba-jontay-porter-banned-man-charged-4d526223923d0ced516c3ae9cc22f9eb

                Gambling is for degenerates and weirdos.  What normal person wants to lose their hard earned money gambling?  Worse, who wants to lose their money in their own home gambling?  At least with casinos and horse racing you had to get up and go out of your house to place your bet.

            The subtle corrupting element is that widespread sports betting increases the demand for instant replay, which in turn, creates LONG delays at the worst possible moment i.e., right after a big play.  By the time the replay official confirms the event actually happened, it no seems as exciting.  That big exuberation-of-the-crowd moment is over.
I‚Äôd also argue that much of the meta-appeal of sport fandom is reminising missed calls from long, long ago e.g., the famous hand of god in soccer, the missed PI that cost your team the game, ‚Äúhe missed the tag,‚Äù tuck rule, Megatron rule, etc.

        Excellent post.If I remember correctly, Gibson was dragging one leg because old football injuries had caught up with him. In today‚Äôs world. Gibson would never have even been up at the plate unfit to even trot the bases after his home run. He would‚Äôve been spotted as a baseball star and never allowed to play football. We probably aren‚Äôt far from sports teams buying humans at 6-8 years old and owning them outright. They will be like startups. Buy a bunch of promise, treat them like ducks and control every aspect of their life (diet, exercise, thinking .. ‚Ä¶), and a few winners pay off. This is practically true of blacks. Even in the early 90s there was that documentary about the two black Chicago kids and the basketball pimps scouring the ghetto on behalf of Nike to make them his so he could profit off of them if they made it.I haven‚Äôt watched sports in years. I got so tired of the, ‚ÄúGilette close shave moment‚Äù, breaks that they did every 2 minutes it became unbearable. Of course, that was insult on top of the injury of the politics, racial scab picking, and the general ridiculous nature of the robotic blonde asking, ‚ÄúWhat was going through your mind when ‚Ä¶‚Äù, to some 75 IQ guy who doesn‚Äôt have a mind but who blubbers in ghetto babble, ‚ÄúI just gave it 110%‚Äù, in a spectacular display of post-American numeracy.Half of the drama of late autumn playoff baseball was pitchers digging deep and not knowing if fatigue would take their edge away, or watching a guy just cratering in a slump fighting that inner battle to will his way to that one clutch hit, or making plays in the field to make up for the slump. Isn‚Äôt that what sports are? Not a display of raw skill, but of a man exhausted and challenged who finds the will to give it his all on top of the communal bonds?Anyway, managerialism sports are something no real man should ever waste his time on. We should be hunting, fishing, organizing mannerbund fighting tournaments and real outdoor expeditions, and just turning on to the real world. Sitting around watching rent-a-flesh that hates you is no way for a man to behave.

                Been around for along time.
And it is not just limited to Europe proper. Many clubs set up schools in other countries (EPL ones in particular seem to like Africa) and get them from an early age through their foreign academy. Another system involves the same concept with local clubs (popular in South America).  A small local club gets a prospect, connections to bigger club, gets the kid in the bigger club academy, who then develops him and draws interest from bigger European clubs (Argentina, Brazil and Colombia being some of the biggest exporters).

                Back when VD and Z were on reasonably good terms, Vox used to quote the Z blog and add commentary.  That‚Äôs how I found Z in the first place.  Guest posts or commentary on another blogger‚Äôs blog is a great way to promote each other.

        As always, the best way to get around the managerial class is to avoid them by going local. We have a college summer league team in my town. The manager is a local businessman. The players, who live with local families, are there mostly for fun and to keep up their skills. It‚Äôs old school baseball. College kids, some from the area, playing in front of people they see on the street and at the local restaurants.

        Amen. I quit following baseball closely long ago with this being just part of the reason why. Earlier this season I saw the Giants pulled a pitcher after six innings who had 15 strikeouts because his pitch count was too high.  Instead of letting him see if he could record a strikeout record, an accomplishment baseball fans used to geek out over, they took him out just like the computer said.  The last time I watched part of a World Series game a couple of years ago, I think an Astros pitcher had a no hitter going through six innings and they pulled him, because it was a certain pitcher‚Äôs job to pitch the 7th, another to pitch the 8th and the closer‚Äôs to pitch the 9th.  The power players in the sport are desperate to reach out to younger non white fans, completely oblivious to the fact they are the least likely to be interested in a game where decisions are made based on what the computer says to do.

                But what happens if the manager does what the computer says, even though it is obviously stupid, and it costs the team the game?
Still, I get your point. And this is where obscene money comes into the picture. Managing and coaching are now such lucrative professions that the managers and coaches are deathly afraid of losing their fabulous riches. Therefore, they think it‚Äôs safer to just follow a computer program, and if the results are horrendous, they‚Äôre not directly on the hook for them.

        This was a great article, but it also made me a little depressed.  I LOVED baseball more than I could express.  Like everything else in our stinking, rotting corpse of a culture it was destroyed.  I stopped following about 15 years ago.  Football was harder for me to let go of.  The last NFL season I followed was the 2019 season.  It‚Äôs all been ruined now, and it‚Äôs just another platform to worship the cancer of the earth, sacred negros.  Baseball is yet another beautiful thing created by Whites that has been destroyed by vibrants.

            I‚Äôm not much of a professional sports guy, but I am interested in how people who used to make professional sports a big part of their lives came to reject it.
Did it happen gradually or was there a distinct episode when you just stopped watching?

                For me it started with all the stupid rule changes that destroyed tradition but would supposedly help the billionaire owners‚Äô bottom lines: the aforementioned pitch clock; ‚Äúghost‚Äù base runners in extra innings; in football they basically made it illegal to play defense; the NBA never enforces elementary rules like traveling or double (sometimes triple, lol) dribbling; in NASCAR they chose to make early races less important by resetting points for ‚Äúthe Chase‚Äù in some bizarre attempt to introduce the ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù of ‚Äúplayoffs‚Äù to a sport that involves all competitors competing at the same time.Then all the rainbow crap. ‚ÄúPride‚Äù nights at every baseball park. Pushing every left-wing cause imaginable. Whamen announcers and on all the talking head shows.The last straw was the China Virus. EVERY major sport immediately shut down. We‚Äôre told to believe that these are some of the toughest, most masculine men, who trained hard their entire lives for this, sacrificed their bodies for the love of the game (remember the bloody sock?) and now these millionaires can‚Äôt take the field because there‚Äôs a new cold virus going around?

                For me it was the year that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were destroying home run records while obviously juiced on ‚Äòroids. The whole thing was so disrespectful of the old timers.A secondary factor was the Latin players (read; black guys who speak Spanish). They simply don‚Äôt know how to act in a dignified manner. The endless hot dogging as they run the bases, the high fives, low fives, dragging a foot as you round third base on your home run trot; it all disgusts me. Twelve pounds of hair popping out from under their helmets, with their skin literally covered in janky tatoos. And they‚Äôre not even shaped like real humans. Too big to be real.And I was not a casual fan of baseball; my dad and I watched just about every televised Dodger or Angels game from 1975 to 1997 (when I left LA to go down South).I miss Dad, I miss the old baseball, but I don‚Äôt want to be a part of the modern expression of it.

                    The negrofication of the sport has to be mentioned.  As the sport becomes whiter and whiter in the United States, the players act blacker and blacker, influenced by the Latin influx and the wider culture of today‚Äôs American youth.Seeing Little Leaguers chimp out on second base after having hit a double makes my blood boil.  Almost all of them are white kids and have a father in their lives.  Those fathers should have a very serious talk with their boys, impressing upon them that should they continue to act like a jungle bunny they‚Äôll be in for a world of hurt.Conversely, the amount of crying by Little Leaguers is getting ridiculous.  It‚Äôs not just reserved for a season ending loss on the biggest stage.  I just saw one pitcher sobbing on the mound after giving up a third inning dinger in a 3-0 game.  But these tears get fawned over by the announcers.  I suppose they have the manager of DIE at ESPN in their earpiece, telling them to sympathetically sell the tears.  It seems that young boys are being told to either act like a jogger or a girl.

                I‚Äôll explain my journey away from sportsball with a story.My wife and I were at a party with neighbors on a weekend afternoon. We needed to leave at a certain time.As we arose to leave someone asked, ‚ÄúAre you going to the game?‚ÄùI had to stop and think, what sports are in season now? Is there a local team that might be playing? I drew blanks.So I told him the truth: I stopped watching sports when I outgrew peer pressure.Two ladies immediately cast daggers at their husbands, one of them our host, and I knew we‚Äôd never be invited back.

I also don‚Äôt care for the artificial salary caps to create parity. Mainly because one of the teams I like had a dynasty and were unable to successfully transition to the cap implemented in their league.

        I pitched for our university‚Äôs baseball team in the mid to late 90s and even then, we had very specific roles. I was our team‚Äôs primary long relief guy (common in college baseball) and an occasional weekday starter for our non-conference games. Every now and then, I‚Äôd come out of the pen to work an inning against a lefty-heavy lineup, but it was mostly three and four innings stints. Loved to vulture those wins from ineffective starters.The pro game is just too specialized and too stats heavy, an approach that has unfortunately filtered down to college as well.We can thanks stats nerd Bill James for bringing sabermetrics to the game. Moneyball has completely changed the game in a bad way, removing the human factor. Managers now rely on a card given to them by their Bill James disciple in the front office (a gouge sheet for those who served in the military) for game decisions instead to relying on their judgement.Also, baseball‚Äôs international player system is rife with abuse. Teams go to the poorest parts of the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Venezuela and Panama and basically buy these teenage kids who might be the next superstar. When and if they make it with a big contract, the whole network of street agents, coaches, uncles and other unscrupulous actors get a piece of the pie.Another way baseball has taken emphasis off the game is all of the distractions at the ballpark. In the olden times, men would go to games in suits after work and the game was entertainment. Now, these children need endless distractions to come to the ballpark.

                Players should pay attention to that sort of thing, or at least be instructed based on it. But drilling them on those numbers‚Äîmaking them conscious‚Äîdoes seem like a mistake. Good athletes rarely knowexactlywhat they‚Äôre doing. Talent is unconscious correct action. Etc.It seems like it‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern‚Äù meta-stats, recent nerd inventions like VORP, significant-seeming sums of insignificant/unknown parts, that have had an uglifying effect on baseball‚Äôs product by taking the place of decision making and storytelling. But I don‚Äôt know baseball.I do remember a turn-of-the-century ‚Äúmoneyball‚Äù fad in pro basketball. A number like VORP seems to make sense there. The game is chaotic, too many guys doing too many things, and box scores don‚Äôt track much of it. But VORP quickly went away, at least from public discourse, because it ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù workmanlike minimum-salary white players who‚Äôd end up failing to ‚Äústep up,‚Äù would ‚Äútank in the playoffs,‚Äù etc. A true lie. Officiating is decisive in the pros‚Äô big games, and it doesn‚Äôt favor the guy with the WHIT EBOY knuckle tattoos. Sport, like the rest of life, has designated losers. The only stat that accounts for it is W-L.

                I refused to let my sons play travel ball for baseball or soccer or join one of those AAU basketball teams run by ‚Äústreet agent‚Äù uncles that were funded by shoe companies and other parasites.
I knew neighbors in my former suburban enclave that spent thousands each year on travel baseball and soccer. They eschew vacations to spend weeks living in hotels in the vain hopes their child can get a college scholarship or even go pro in tournaments that no one cares or watches except for the families.

            Do they ‚Äúneed‚Äù the distractions, or do the people in charge of gameday atmosphere assume they need the distractions? In the before times, I don‚Äôt recall anybody demanding to have rap blasted into their ears loudly enough to make them bleed. And, in point of fact, as the distractions have increased, attendance has decreased. Some correlation there, but likely some causation, too.

        Great article, Z, and it‚Äôs probably Exhibit B, on why I stopped watching team sports decades ago (Exhibit A being the astronomical salaries along with free agency that caused it, turning pro sports into a game of mercenaries instead of hometown heroes).I was a huge Cincinnati Reds fan growing up before there was cable in our small town and I listened to Reds games in my bedroom on WLW (The Big One) 700 AM nearly every night in the summers.  My dad would listen to Atlanta Braves games in the living room. Between innings we would give each other updates. But when something major happened we wouldn‚Äôt wait for the inning break and I would burst into the living room, ‚ÄúBench just hit a three-run homer!‚Äù, or my dad would open my bedroom door, ‚ÄúNiekro just hit another batter.  His knuckleball isn‚Äôt working tonight.‚Äù  Days of yore that are no more.  And don‚Äôt even get me started on the horrible spectacle the Olympics has become.

        ‚ÄúNo one watches any sporting event to see the stat guys show off their latest number crunching.‚ÄùBaseball is the one sport where some of the fans actually do watch because of the obsessive number crunching. It has long been the most stat-driven game there is. By recently outlawing ‚Äúthe shift,‚Äù the folks running MLB have taken a fairly decisive measure to limit the negative effects of the fanatical number crunchers. The near-extinction of complete games has mainly developed as a result of needing to baby starting pitchers because those sons of bitches get paid so much that nobody wants to risk injuring them.Nevertheless, Z-man‚Äôs larger points about an over-managed, over-mechanized society can hardly be denied. A great example is the use of replay review in today‚Äôs sports. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is to get the call right.‚Äù Not really. The most important thing is to keep being entertaining. Besides, replay review often leads to the wrong call being made anyway. The notion that everything can be perfectly managed down to the most minute detail is a pipedream that retards the organic flow of life and contributes to human misery.

        Great post today. Yes, humanity matters. And yes, we are opposed by technocrats that substitute spreadsheets for leadership. And yes, they will be the death of us if we do not stop them. And to do that, we must all become Kirk Gibson. Know what you will do when the fog of chaos has arrived. You have one job, one focus, one chance to make a difference. Make it count, and others will follow. One shot can start a stampede, and the technos have no answer for that. In matters of war, heart begets unrelenting persistence.

            I ultimately stopped watching baseball when logos started appearing on the uniforms. I cannot stand New Era and Nike logos all over the uniforms. Logos are for f*gg*t European sportsball. Fun fact: the Yanks were the only baseball team that refused ANY makers logo on their vaunted uniform. Of course, in the past few years they now have ALL the logos and even some corporate thing on the sleeve.

        It goes hand in hand with the financialization of everything else. I played baseball in high school. I found out I was good enough to make the team because my parents didn‚Äôt mind schlepping me to some Little League games and practices back when I was younger. They had no real objections to me playing, and as long as I could catch a ride to / from practice, they didn‚Äôt much care.Nowadays, of course, they‚Äôd probably be hauled up on child abuse charges. Because if your L‚Äôil Hurler is Good Enough to Make the Team ‚Ñ¢, then he needs to be attending summerlong instructional camps by age 12, on a nutrition and conditioning plan by age 10, and, of course, playing travel ball pretty much from the moment the crown clears the birth canal.

        I could write a dissertation on baseball. I was a Bill James reader in the early 1980s when he distributed his ‚ÄúAbstract‚Äù by mimeograph through the US mail.Baseball has not only been destroyed by the tinkering with rules, as Z Man outlines, but by the behavior and antics of the players. Until I was 18 or so and began to develop serious interests while in college, I followed the game obsessively. There‚Äôs not a cell in my body that had any ill will toward the sport until the last 10-15 years.Now it‚Äôs unwatchable; it is, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, like watching the NBA. Hit by pitch? Point at the dugout with both arms, point at Mamacita in the sky, strut, glare, walk, stop, twerk, and complete a 12-point hand jive move with the 1st base coach before donning oven mitts to run the bases.2020 sealed it; the Boston Red Sox had ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù on the Green Monster facing the Mass Turnpike and that was the end. It‚Äôs extremely sad, as I got to know so many of my older male relatives through watching the sport, and learned a great deal (not about baseball) while doing so.So much has been ruined. Maybe they can ‚Äúparlay‚Äù with their gramps now and talk about under/overs on whether that horsefly is going to land on the couch or not. What a pathetically impoverished world of images and emptiness we now inhabit.

        The 1970 Orioles‚Äô were managed by Earl Weaver, a pre-computer stat guy. Yet he only needed that short roster.In 1968 when he won 31 games, the last pitcher to get 30 or more, Tiger Denny McLain worked to finish his games in under 2 hours so he could play the organ in lizard lounges. An eccentric and amusing con artist, he later went to federal pen for dealing cocaine. He‚Äôs still alive at 83. Here he is in 1968 on the Sullivan show:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibehUqFlJ_0

        Truly the number crunchers and the bean counters have engineered a quiet coup over the decades. Statistics and other allied tools (such as Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical modeling) have taken on a life of their own, like a medieval golem, and now govern large swathes of human behavior. This has been at the expense of other older modes of human apprehension, which had a greater amount of time-tested wisdom.

        One of the big changes since I was a kid is the de-Americanization of the game. Major League rosters are now loaded with Latin Americans and a sprinkling of Koreans and Japanese. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs much cheaper to sign kids from poor Latin American countries than to develop American talent. The Japanese professional leagues have a cap on the number of foreigners on a team‚Äôs roster.

        I can‚Äôt watch any more.  Some statistician decided that every hitter should swing for the fences every at bat.  No more small-ball stuff ‚Äì singles hitters like Boggs and Carew, no hit-and-runs, bunts, few steals‚Ä¶
The strike zone now is about half of what it should be, so teams burn through pitchers at an unsustainable rate ‚Äì while I get frustrated and watch golf instead.

            I‚Äôm intrigued by the allegations that professional golf is a money laundering operation. Since there‚Äôs no way the Saudis, or whomever, are making a profit on LIV, not even close. The purse size for the players at PGA events also brings this into question in my mind. Are they really bringing in that much $ from the John Deere Classic? That aside, golf is one of the few sports that retains some nervous tension.

        Don‚Äôt worry, the transhumanists have a plan for this too. People will be born specialized or receive their specialization mRNA shots soon after birth.

                I am not okay with this. Anyway, I know my comment is a bit out there, but you would be surprised how much the transhumanist ideology has been infiltrating universities over the past decade or so. The Covid fiasco was the first large scale test of automated data-driven control of society. Transhumanists were involved with that and with the vaxx business.

                    Long ago I was hopeful about the benefits of future tech, but at this point it‚Äôs clear that the changes brought by new tech tools accrue chiefly to the evil side of the ledger.  Sure, its fun to make your machines do stuff by talking to them instead of pushing buttons, but having them rat you out to Big Brother isn‚Äôt a good trade.As in sport, so too in all else.  Those with power use technology against the rest of us, enlarging the power gap between and causing immiseration.Uncle Ted may have been wrong in how he used the mail system, but his chief conclusion about dehumanizing technology seems sound to me.

        This hyper-quantification occurs in football, too. Hence, head coaches and offensive coordinators no longer make game-management decisions. Instead, they defer to computer programs crammed with all the latest statistics. And the results, largely because they don‚Äôt take into account current game conditions and how the respective teams, position groups and players are performing, are often farcical. We sometimes see teams go for it on 4th-and-3 at their own 25-yard line with the score tied and seven minutes remining in the first quarter. Anybody with any intuitive knowledge of the game knows this is idiotic, but they do it anyway, and usually with disastrous results.But we live in a society where you‚Äôre admonished with wagging finger to ‚Äútrust the science,‚Äù and perforce to worship the numbers. On top of that few football coaches have high-level quantitative ability, so they feel like they have no standing to dispute what the metrics geeks tell them. And it‚Äôs the helluva lot easier to just do what the computer tells you than to actually think for yourself. Not only are machines turning us physically into turnips, but the digital world is transforming us into mental rutabagas.

        Idk, I think it‚Äôs a mixed bag.  They banned the shift, which is a stats based way to put all the defenders on one side of the field because if the hitter makes contact it‚Äôs going to go to that side of the field.  By banning the shift, they neutered the stats guys.And frankly it was obscene watch hitters peacock at the plate with all manner of rituals.  A pitch would the thrown, and the hitter would step out of the box for 20 seconds and readjust all his batting gloves.  Then, repeat this after every gd pitch.  The pitch clock has been a boon.They can fix the ‚Äúmatchup baseball‚Äù problem by simply allowing only x number of substitutions per game.  They did this with challenges, and it helped a lot.The thing they should get rid of?  The strike box.  The game is worse when you take the human element of umpiring out if the game.  We don‚Äôt need more robots.i like that games are much shorter, now.  And the sport is still better on radio than on television.

                Yes, this was a circular problem.  When HRs became the holy grail, players never learned to bunt.  Then when the shift came in, no one could beat it, so they tried to hit the ball even harder.  Kind of like our elections, where the more the other side cheats, the more we are told to vote harder.

            The peacocking is an underappreciated reason for game length. That is the reason for the pitch clock. I stopped watching baseball about 10 years ago, and I remember actually laughing while watching both the pitcher and hitter doing their goofy rain dances while Vin Scully was telling some story, waiting for the action to continue. If I wanted to watch grown men dance away the evil spirits, I‚Äôd have lived with the Sioux.

            The shift is comically easy to beat. All you need to do is lay down a bunt or lazy ground ball the other way ‚Äî two activities that used to be trivially basic for any professional hitter. That‚Äôs why we had baseball for over a century without the shift and it is only a very recent phenomenon!
The fact that the response to modern players lacking basic competency is to try to change the rulebook is, I think, a very accurate metaphor for the clown world we currently live in.

        I was always a baseball fan and player, I played in a 18 to 30 hardball league when I was 30 against kids in college on baseball scholarships, a few triple A guys , but mostly old men ( in their late twenties) who were looking for one more go round before the softball beer drinking days were all you could swing. About 12 years ago I bought a subscription to MLB.com and quickly found out that the team who played in the stadium 5 miles from my house were blocked out. I started following the team that was 120 miles from the house and the rival of the team I wasn‚Äôt allowed to watch. I had to go to this stadium to service some of their equipment one day and showed up wearing a ball cap they didn‚Äôt appreciate ( the rival). They were shocked and asked me not to wear it and even offered me a nice fitted blue one.when I said thanks but no thanks the engineer asked me to leave. No problem, I got to the parking lot exit and was asked to come back. Well it‚Äôs overtime now, not this 1.5 stuff but 1.7 with a minimum of 3 hours. They agreed, I got paid and never bought a 23 dollar beer with the money I made since. It‚Äôs embarrassing to think back on all those games I went to over the years. And that‚Äôs without the drag- nuns and crack lives matter bullshit. I‚Äôd rather watch paint dry then watch a mlb or nfl or nba game with girl announcers and crybaby players. As Zman said a week or two ago, it ain‚Äôt coming back.

It‚Äôs kind of like how sterile the Olympics are ‚Äì virtually none of the athletes are amateurs, in the sense they have a day job and work their sport on the side ‚Äì they‚Äôre all pros so who cares ‚Äì I know I don‚Äôt.As for baseball, I gave up long ago largely because of the length of the games and the annoying subbing in and out.  Probably the last bunch of games I watched was when the Cubs finally won the series for the 2nd time in 2014.  I‚Äôd say the one thing it‚Äôs got going for it right now is it‚Äôs a hell of a lot Whiter than football or basketball ‚Äì by a long shot.

        Great post!  Another problem with the modern game is the much higher percentage of at bats that end in a strikeout, walk or home run.  The game used to have a lot more motion, as more balls were put into play, and players would steal and try to advance runners.  Yes, more HR/BB/Ks give teams a statistical advantage, but they add to the time when everyone is just standing around.  The statistical advantages do nothing to make the game more entertaining, since wins and losses are a zero sum game (i.e., all the teams wins and losses added together will always equal .500).Now if you really enjoy watching men standing around, go to an NFL game.  Just kidding, don‚Äôt.  For a 3 hour game, there is 11 minutes when the ball is actually in play.

        The thing about this is 1988 was a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù time in every respect of the term. Yet, we did not have all this managerial BS we have now. In fact, there has been little technological advance in the past 35 year except for semiconductors and computation. Throw in large flat panel displays and that‚Äôs it. No bio-engineering (that works, mRNA ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt count), no nanotechnology, no L-5 space colonies, no  nothing. And women were prettier in 1988 than they are today.

        Technology insures an unmitigated host of unintended and negative consequences.  On the macro long run, it makes people weaker and stupider.  A sober look at the facts cannot deny that.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want indoor plumbing and (some) medicine and am way too domesticated to hunt buffalo on horseback.  But a certain point of technology, it is a curse no matter how helpful it is in the moment.

            The A‚Äôs were pretty good for the time, but it would be difficult to keep such a team together in the era of free agency.   The movie you refer to, ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù with Brad Pitt is a good explanation of what Z-man discusses.  I recommend it.

                They were competitive at the margins, but they lacked the IT to win a championship. Imo, analytics are good for giving you the extra little things, but the big things that win championships are beyond its scope.

                    What team are you talking about, and when?
Here‚Äôs my A‚Äôs‚Ä¶
‚ÄúAfter moving to Oakland in 1968, the A‚Äôs quickly turned things around. The highlight was their dominance in the early 1970s, where they won three consecutive World Series titles in 1972, 1973, and 1974. They consistently posted winning records throughout the decade, including a 101-60 record in 1971‚Äù
That record probably beats every other team except the Yanks.  That was the era to which the movie ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù relates.  I‚Äôve not read the book, but suspect that‚Äôs the same team and era.

        Great post Z. The nerds ruined baseball. It‚Äôs just that simple. The ‚Äúthree true outcomes‚Äù + the shift + specialization produced a quite frankly unwatchable sport. It‚Äôs telling that the team that bought most into this brand of baseball still ended up banging trash cans to try to get an edge.Also ‚Äì the nerds also ruined baseball discussion. Go online to talk baseball and there will be some gamma who digs up some ultra obscure metric to AKSHULLY you. Nobody can actually just trust their eyes and have some fun with it. It‚Äôs beyond tedious. By the way the same nerds are in the process of ruining football, beyond even what the Competition Committee and Roger Goodell could do to it.

        Who on earth watches sport nowadays? Sports, like everything else, has become bloated and corrupt. You are not watching what you think you are watching. Bloat and corruption is one of the surest characteristics of humanity.The Catholic church was an egregious example. The attempted fix, after centuries of war, was to go back to something more austere.In Juvenal‚Äôs third satire, a man who finds Rome crowded, full of foreigners and subject to the degenerate influence of women, homosexuals and the elite, seeks out a quieter life in the provinces. The older, simpler ways have always been best,Technology, which accelerates, also accelerates the bloating phenomenon, far faster than it can be contained. We have mastered growth and are now busily turning the entire planet into Las Vegas, the apotheosis of bloat ‚Äì that actually seems to be the deliberate intention.We‚Äôve done everything else. Keeping the bloat under control is the only human challenge left.

        I don‚Äôt think fans mind stat guys doing nerd things if it means their team is more likely to win the game. It‚Äôs more of a problem if you‚Äôre watching some random team you don‚Äôt care much about aside from the stars.Here‚Äôs the problem with reminiscing about the days of guys pitching 300+ innings and complaining that today‚Äôs pitchers are pansies. Baseball has been so optimized, the keys to unlocking maximum physical performance so exploited, that it takes a far more brutal toll on the body, hence the massive amount of injuries. This is also why the 2024 team has so many more players than 1970‚Äôs; guys get hurt all the time and need to be replaced.Guys who‚Äôd be throwing 85 MPH fastballs forty years ago are instead throwing 99+ today based on various factors; more pressure from coaches from high school onward, more knowledge about pitching mechanics, more emphasis on weight training and nutrition, and so on.Back then, power pitchers like Nolan Ryan or J.R. Richard were freaks of nature. They worked hard, but were kind of born with it; Richard was something like 6 foot 7 inches and could hold a whole bucket of baseballs in his gigantic hand.But for every Scherzer, Verlander, or Cole in the classic ace mold, you have guys like Chris Sale, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow, Jake deGrom; who have bursts of brilliance when healthy, but get hurt all the time from pushing their bodies beyond their limits.Unsurprisingly, teams make unexciting moves like yanking the starter when his pitch count goes up because they want to get more innings out of their guy before he inevitably needs Tommy John surgery. Can you really blame them? Yeah, maybe it‚Äôs good for fans to see Blake Snell throw 150 pitches in one game, but if his elbow blows out a week later, it seems a bit irresponsible in retrospect, and not great for the team or the fans.The question we really should be asking about baseball is, what needs to change to reduce injuries and keep star players on the field? I don‚Äôt know. Impose a pitch speed limit? But the ever-increasing proliferation of injuries is awful for baseball, and I‚Äôm not just saying this because I‚Äôm an Astros fan and they have a whole bucket of All-Star caliber players on the injured list.

        The problem that drains drama from baseball is not discontinuity of action but discontinuity in the cast of characters ‚Äî namely the pitchers.It is now a given that your manager will methodically call on four or five pitchers in the game. The starter only shoulders responsibility for six innings, with three relievers lined up to protect the lead, or two or three clods lined up to mop up the loss.So it is rare that two good starters battle doggedly into the late innings with personal responsibility in the line. Would you write a play or movie where the key characters all keep randomly disappearing?

        The problem with Moneyball / Sabremetrics is that the map is not the terrain. There are so many externalities that cannot be measured or quantified on a spreadsheet that over-reliance upon it causes defeat instead of victory.The LA Dodgers are a poster child for that. Stuff that works out in the regular season Moneyball wise, mostly fail in the high pressure, only good teams playing playoffs. You can see that a lot ‚Äî teams/managers who play the hot hands go much farther than the corporate moneyball people like Dave Roberts, a spreadsheet gofer for Andrew Friedman.James, it must be recalled, was a KC factory janitor when he started his statistical abstract. Beane just applied that to player selection, figuring a guy who did not look all that great but got on base a lot could win games. And up to a point, that sort of guy could.When all the infielders in MLB could field bunts well, bunting was not a smart strategy. Now, at least 20 years into no one being taught how to field bunts, it can win games. Just as stealing with the new rules and pitchers and catchers not being very well trained in the pitch-out, or quick throw to 1st or 2nd, means a steal is not the sure fire out it might have been in 1990. That is the other thing, competitive adjustment means the stuff that was ‚Äúthe book‚Äù five years ago is probably already obsolete.That goes wider than baseball. People want a ‚Äúbig change and that‚Äôs it‚Äù and don‚Äôt understand that the process of change never, ever stops. As society gets more complex, and more dependent on inter-connected technology, it becomes more fragile and easier to break in unexpected ways. Meaning the techno-repression of our Overlords is likely to result in say the Muslim Brotherhood seizing power in the UK and inviting Putin to send troops.Once a society, or a sport, goes down the technology driven dependency path, you cannot go back, only forward to ever greater change and complexity.

                Their season ticket renewal rates for next year must be atrocious.
A big reason to buy season tickets is you get guaranteed chance at all playoff tickets. They are so far from being playoff worthy that people are thinking they will just sit it out for a few years and watch at home.

        I remember the NY Mets and their first World Series championship‚Äîyep, that old.  In that day the manager broke the team up into two.  One day one team would play, the next the other team would play.  Caused an uproar at the time.  (Aside: I actually lived in the neighborhood and went to grade school with Wes Westrum‚Äôs (Mets manager) daughter.)But what I really remember was the sense of community their run at the World Series brought to a city as jaded as NYC always was.  You could go to a lunchtime diner and in would walk a Black guy and he‚Äôd scream ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go Mets!‚Äù And the diner would erupt in chanting such‚ÄîWhites, Hispanics (PR‚Äôs), everyone. I was there.   Such was the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù that sports teams brought about in those days.Sigh.  Does anything today bring us together as one people?  Hell, we can‚Äôt even seem to fashion a devil to unite us.

            I also remember the ‚Äô69 Mets (the Mets‚Äô first, and one of only two in their entire history, World Series championship team).  They were managed by Gil Hodges, not Wes Westrum.  Hodges used a lot of left-right platooning on that team ‚Äì i.e., left-handed hitters against opposing right-handed pitchers, and vice versa ‚Äì (e.g., Ed Kranepool (l) and Donn Clendenon (r) at first base; Al Weis (s) and Ken Boswell (l) at second base; Wayne Garrett (l) and Ed Charles (r) at third base; Art Shamsky (l) and Ron Swoboda (r) in right field), but he certainly didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbr[eak] the team up into two,‚Äù with each of the ‚Äútwo teams‚Äù playing on alternating days.

                Didn‚Äôt say the 69 Mets were managed by Wes Westrum, only that I went to school with daughter and knew him.  Was a surprise to me when he took over, but that was after Hodges to be sure.  Your memory might be better than mine,  on the splitting of the team, but it was often discussed by commentators and sure seemed more often than the days facing the infrequent leftie pitcher, but that might be my memory of the series and playoffs.

            I hate the modern game but am somewhat of a baseball historian. Back in the late 1800s baseball was considered really freaking quick‚Ä¶like have you got two hours to spare, madam, while we watch the ball game conveniently next to the beer garden? Then we can spend the next three hours watching boats go by on the river?Games were regularly 2 hours or less until sometime in the 1960s or 1970s when TV started edging into the sport. It was a slow process, but by the 1990s or so baseball was being extended to 3 hours plus due to commercial breaks and the players themselves doing their stupid superstitious nonsense before every pitch. And this was encouraged because ESPN had something to talk about. Seriously. Players were always superstitious, but watch an at-bat from the 1970s compared to now. The gesticulations and pirouettes that players started doing is ridiculous. That is main reason for the pitch clock.Now of course we got commercial breaks ‚Äì much longer than in the 1970s, where it was basically one razor commercial ‚Äì along with the fancy movements, and the multiple game halts, and baseball wonders why it can‚Äôt keep the game time low? The action on the field is now so sparse that much of the televised game is spentwatching the players in the dugout. I don‚Äôt want to see Aaron Judge being a retarded corporate goofball in the dugout.

                What‚Äôs also hilarious is they keep changing the rules to increase offense while simultaneously trying to shorten the length of games. Hello! Do you not know your sport and that it has no clock, and that games can only end after 27 outs? I wish the people in the league office had the same brains as the stat nerds.

            If you were at a game, there wouldn‚Äôt have been all the distractions of today.  And back then most people had to rely on radio, but kids and old men alike were often glued to that radio set when their team was playing, and working guys would be too on weekends and after night games were introduced. There were some very colorful announcers, plus no-bull veteran players who knew what they were talking about. I don‚Äôt mean to be too much of an old fogey, but another thing I couldn‚Äôt stand about more recent announcers is their non-stop jabbering. A lot of times, silence is better.

The stuff about Cobb is interesting. They don‚Äôt seem to like him ‚Äì they think he was an angry nut, and RACIST even for that time. They respect his game but he comes off as a bit sad, in his personal life.
Waddell is something else. But that kind of eccentric has been gone for 100 years.

                        Good points.  Waddell would never be tolerated by that managerial/expert/credentials system that we have today. Yet they‚Äôll put up with a lot of ‚Äúinner-city‚Äù behavior.And those old-timers weren‚Äôt very welcoming to rookies, in large part, were they? You had to fight for your spot. Some rough shenanigans on the field too sometimes.And yeah, Cobb had some prickly attitudes, for sure, and lived a lonely life as you suggested. I believe I also read, though, that he did a lot of good things for people quietly, maybe after he retired, and on behalf of whites and blacks. Helping needy former players and their families, etc. Of course the racism stuff means he‚Äôs condemned to outer darkness forever.

                        Cobb also lived a temperate life and took care of his health, in contrast to the morally suspect, hard-living Babe Ruth.
Cobb was a stern, yet devoted family man. He was intelligent enough to parlay his baseball earnings into even greater business wealth after baseball.
Obviously Cobb‚Äôs humble life style and small-ball play style did not fit into the zeitgeist of the 1910s and Roaring ‚Äô20s.

        I also suspect they use the breaks to choke opponent players in the psychological sense. Being interrupted in your concentration can ruin your game for the day.
Psychology has always been a major part of sports. But excessively speculating in it plus excessive commercialization can ruin it

        I think its been 20 years or so since I watched baseball on the telly. I‚Äôve never been to a game. I am not surprised to hear that baseball has gone ‚Äútechnical‚Äù with the stat guys using computers and calling the shot. Everything else has gone technical.Baseball went through a rather dramatic culture shock around 25 years ago when Barry Bonds and guys like him were caught juicing. I know juicing is normal in NFL. But baseball had a far more traditional culture, both fans and players, at the time that I sensed was obliterated by the juicing scandals. It seems to me this is around the time the stat guys and specialists entered the sport.

        I think the argument for the quantitative revolution (in baseball) was that it would find talent and wins where those neanderthal managers of the time would just run out the guy until he got injured enough to quit. Yes, every now and then we‚Äôd get a magical moment like Grover Cleveland Alexander or Kirk Gibson, but we‚Äôd also get arms blown out and careers shortened like Jim Bouton or Sandy Koufax. And how many White Sox teams could have won the pennant if the neanderthals in charge decided to think differently rather than just play the guys their neanderthal scouts thought ‚Äúlooked good‚Äù?We‚Äôre in this civilizational mess partly because the neanderthals in charge think certain people ‚Äúlook good‚Äù and can craft a narrative around them, rather than picking people that would actually be helpful.

        Baseball‚Äôs always been about using the stats to make decisions, just that prior to saber-metrics, the *wrong* stats were being used.Managers were making changes to get a same/opposite handedness advantage since the earliest days of the game. Specialists have always been a thing (in fact, one of the reasons pitchers in the 20th century used to pitch so many innings is because rosters carried fewer pitchers in order to allow the manager to have more hitting/defensive specialists!)They would seek to deploy their best hitters and pitchers at critical points in the game. The trouble was they thought their best pitcher was the one with the lowest ERA and their best hitter had the most RBIs the year before (those players more than likely were just lucky.) A man with 40+ saves the year before was an excellent closer, and they would always hold onto him until a ‚Äúsave situation‚Äù in the ninth (even if the game was won or lost in earlier innings.) The pitcher with the most ‚Äúwins‚Äù was your ace and you gave him the ball when it mattered the most.I really think it was the money men and not the stats nerds that ruined baseball.

        The best baseball on TV IMO is the Little League World Series.

        Correction, the Cleveland Guardians/Indians are the best team in baseball, with a .595 average.However, the point is well taken, and some of these stats are ridiculous and provide nothing of value to anyone outside of the front office. However baseball was always the most stat driven game of all the major sports. As much as I‚Äôd love to have a more informal game, this is what there is. Also smaller market teams benefit from this for all the Money Ball reasons.I‚Äôd also agree that legalized sports gambling has ruined the pleasure of watching these games. Between the ads and the stupid prop bets, it‚Äôs all too much.
