        I listened to radio news the other day, something I rarely if ever do (listen to or watch “the news”), and a Palestinian lady was saying that there is a pact between the Israeli and Palestinian governments that Palestinian authorities such as cops must squash any Palestinian protestors (against Israel) and that this is exactly what they do.  So Palestinians are not just protesting Israeli aggression but they’re protesting their own government as well for complying with Israel’s demands that their own people not be allowed to protest.  And of course when they do, they get squashed, as per the political agreement.I really feel for these people as they are stuck between a rock (Israel) and a hard place (their own government).I always wondered why a bunch of Europeans wanted to live in the middle of a desert anyway.  They are really out of place there.  Jews do well wherever in the world they go.  Why Israel?Its not like the European Jews who move there are religious and want to spend all day at the wailing wall praying.  The religious orthodox Jews do not comprise the majority of ex-pats there.Its all so very strange.
