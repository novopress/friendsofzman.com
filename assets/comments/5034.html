        The phrase ‘social engineering’ can be seen as a oxymoron because here it is where you join two words that have little natural connectivity. What society does is rarely measurable and almost always a mystery even after some event or trend happens. Engineering is being precise and thorough and working to known limits.
There is no way society can be engineered, and not least because the ‘engineers’ haven’t a clue what they are doing even if society took any real notice.

        I was having a conversation with a non-moonbat friend the other day who was fondly reminiscing over his positive experiences as a child in one of those education experiments during the post-war era.  In his case, it had been taking down the fences, having more of a campus atmosphere, and more open classrooms.  The experiment had taken place in conjunction with a university, so most of the kids were professors’ offspring.  I pointed out that we had tried to mainstream this pilot in my home state and the result was a lot of kids removing themselves from the gene pool by chasing balls into the streets and pushers and other thugs pretty much openly operating on high school grounds.That was the problem with a lot of the studies from that era.  The pilot programs never took place in the Bronx or East St Louis or even (pre-riot, blue collar) Long Beach or Newark.  They were always in some comfortable suburban setting usually near a university with elite parents and elite kids.  So even in the “golden age” of social studies, the researchers were guilty of massive errors in their studies’ set up and data gathering.In contrast, the mass-education, mass-fitness, and mass-hygiene movements were all bottom up phenomena which evolved from the efforts in thousands of educators in thousands of communities.  As you point out, top down social engineering keeps failing and nobody seems to ever remember why.  Meanwhile, legions of dull, fat kids are evidence that we’ve forgotten why we invested in mass education and fitness in the first place.  I think the two are connected.

        Something I’ve come to enjoy in my dotage is responding to some claim by my Progressive friends with, “what happened when we tried that the last time?”
The response is always bewilderment. On occasion they muster a “we never fully committed to it in the past” but mostly I get blank stares. Social science relies heavily on universal amnesia.

        Social Science and all of its daughter “studies” faculties are just more job programs for the marginally employable.It is always fun to contrast social engineering with the real kind.  If an engineer designs a bridge and it falls into the gorge due to his faulty design, then that design is likely never to be used again and the any other extant versions are likely to be braced and/or have their capacities severely reduced.On the other hand, the social engineering efforts of the post war era have largely failed.  Before WWII, the implementation of mass K-12 education really unlocked some previously dormant human potential.  Mass literacy and numeracy were foundational to creating the wealthiest societies ever.But as far as I can tell, every single post-WWII effort to improve on the pre-war gains has been a failure.  And I believe that between 1950 and 1980 there were some serious efforts to improve educational outcomes, rooted in real science.  We seem to have reached the upper bound of what education can achieve given the biological limits of human intelligence.  Of course, discussing intelligence is taboo in our society so we are reduced to debating inanities like teacher salaries, universal free tertiary education, and testing regimes.The bridge keeps falling down, social engineers keep building new ones with cool new colors and facades.  We are almost to the point where we’ve forgotten what bridges are supposed to do in the first place.

            ” If an engineer designs a bridge and it falls into the gorge due to his faulty design,”…, and that engineer will be defrocked and probably sued into a lifetime of poverty. When is the last time you heard of a failed social engineer being defrocked and sued?
