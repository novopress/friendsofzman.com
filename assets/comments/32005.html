        The logic here is that you are either on the side of unconditional support for Israel or you are Hitler.
Making us choose between them or Hitler? Are they *sure* this is really the path they want to take?

                I read my first Hitler speech for a logic class I’m taking. The teacher recommended Lincoln. Hitler was complaining about how oppressive England was to the third world. The most evil man ever to live, and in all my ed I’ve never been assigned on original work of his…strange

                This morning, I was glancing at The Gateway Pundit’s coverage of the Ashley Biden controversy:
https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2024/05/ashley-biden-officially-confirms-her-diary-where-she/
I scrolled down to the kkk0mments, and, low and behold, I see
“Da Lawyerzz who have the JWO Controlling Biden do the wording.“
“Yup, 51 of them in Genocide Joe’s Cabinet! His Puppetmaster’s!“
Presumably the “JWO” would be the “j00ish world order”.
It certainly feels like the dam is about to burst.

            What gets me is people saying, “This is just like Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden, Hamburg, Tokyo, etc.” as a way to justify the indiscriminate mass destruction of Gaza.  It’s like they’re saying, “You aerially murdered a million innocent people at our command then, therefore you need to be OK with usaeriallymurdering hundreds of thousands now.”My reaction to such rhetoric keeps being, I thought we had all done a retrospective and realized how wrong those WW2 bombings were, and how wrong it is now should only further underline how wrong it was then.Also, Palestinian civilians are toHamasas the Jews put in camps in the forties were to Bolshevik/Spartakusbund revolutionaries.  When they say, “There are no innocent Palestinians in Gaza, they all deserve what they are getting”, they are in essence claiming that the Holocaust was a moral military necessity.

                Sadly, there’s no such thing as “civilians” in war, much as we might like to think otherwise. Sure, the winners will prosecute the losing side for “war crimes”, even if both sides did the same thing, but they never have hesitated to punish the civilians with sometimes crippling reparations. Both sides generally make use of conscription, so the civilian distinction is temporal at best.
I used to think as you, but cold hard reality says it’s just a face-saving ruse.

            It’s too late for them now. Pandora’s box has had it’s lock well shredded.Hubris has chosen rule by naked power. They really aren’t very smart. Maybe they once were, or maybe we were just incredibly naive, utopian and sheltered.Doesn’t matter. History is moving is moving again, and fast. Jews are not White. Their POC(with jews at the helm) vs. White plan is failing. Their deracination, divide and conquer plan is not going how they wanted it to.One, because if you weaken the west you can no longer use it’s strength (duh, idiots, 2001 was your shot to create greater Israel and even then the USA was too internally weakened to accomplish a lasting dominance over a billion muslims) and two, because even brown people aren’t retarded enough to see whites prostrating themselves in penitence on mass for half a century and not think that something might be goofy with the narrative of a White… what do the jews call it? Structural whatever? Even browns aren’t that stupid (at least the smart one’s who count aren’t) and what’s worse the jews didn’t indoctrinate their masses since birth to be ashamed of themselves. Big oversight. Their NPCs are going to look our for their interests and the current ruling class has been fucking up royally on almost all metrics, economic, cultural, spiritual. They can’t even get the bread and circuses right anymore, nobody likes what woke media is spewing out but the 5% of the most degenerate. As much as media shits on White people, most non-whites (the majority anyway) do not have the jewish exterminationist mindset towards our people… excluding maybe blacks… The slavery thing has left a deep psychological wound. Best thing for them would be to give them some land, separate and try to help them a bit I think, but really we owe them nothing at this point. We have given and suffered way too much on their behalf already.Not to mention that younger Whites in most areas just don’t have the sheltered formative year life experience required to still buy the white savior propaganda that led boomers to blissfully accept rose colored glasses on the tribe issue. Young whites… those without Stockholm syndrome anyway, are far more radical than previous generations. By necessity, we have to interact with this Brave New World, we don’t have the luxury of choosing to ignore it or pretending reality isn’t what it is.

        I think, for your average white person (older than your average “American” at this point) this campus conflict is being viewed not through the old Ken Burns-Spielbergian lens. That is to say, it’s not about the plucky kind-of-white Jews versus the swarthy darker barbarians who want to holocaust God’s chosen. The massive influx from South and Central America (and even Asia and Africa now) is making normie more hypersensitive to the alienness of both groups. Why, he seems to be asking himself, am I caring about a battle between hooknoses and unibrows, when I have an aquiline nose (or “alkaline nose” as Tariq Nasheed said to Jared Taylor) and my eyebrows don’t join in the middle?Jewish support for open borders as not just a policy—a la Hart-Celler—but as a unifying ideology—the Emma Lazarus “tired huddled masses” schmaltz—has ironically resulted in Jews being shunted aside and hated by the brown, black, and yellow arrivistes. More importantly, though, it’s caused whites see Jews, if not clearly for the first time, much more clearly than ever before.Jonathan Greenblatt and the ADL baring their fangs have also done more reputational damage to the Jews than Lloyd Blankfein, the Sackler Clan, and obnoxious comedians combined. It’s not quite deicide, but normie now sees Jew and thinks, “Wants to take my most fundamental right away from me.” Or “rights,” rather, since the ADL and “coastal elites” are also hostile to the Second Amendment, too.

                    I suspect one could accurately trace the decline of academia by looking at commencement speakers at elite universities diachronically, beginning, let’s say, in 1966 and continuing to the present. I think in 1966 the speakers will have been statesmen, captains of industry, war heroes and towering intellectuals. Nowadays you’ll see plenty of commedians, actors, rappers and athletes. And needless to say, contemporary speakers will be far more “diverse” than in the far more serious and noble bygone age.

That doesn’t make sense.  They walked out because of his support for what Israel is doing to the Gazans.

        Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, have gone on TV and invoked Amalek and referred to Gazans as animals. It’s clear this is a religious war to them, so it needs to be talked about in terms of their religion. They feel that Gazans are beasts and that, as Jews, they have the right and duty to do what they want with them, including total extermination of every man, woman and child, and nobody has any right to say otherwise. That’s it. They can try to hide it, but they’re not trying to hide it. The finance minister said it explicitly a week or two ago, and it’s obvious that is what they are doing.This is not a government that can be reasoned with, by anyone. The fact that Congress so willingly handed them $26 billion and the government gives them diplomatic cover on the world stage is a horrifying dereliction of duty that, in a just world, would lead to every person who voted for it to be tried as war criminals. Israel has gone totally rogue and any reasonable, thinking person can see that, no matter what sophistry people try to trot out to support them.

                It’s never books.Jews to whom ancient literature has any meaning don’t decide anything. Do Biblical textual scholars put trannies in the Vatican? Are Irish arsons caused by Keith Woods tweets about Hegel?Jews in America hate you because their mother hated you and their friends hate you and everyone who’s richer than them hates you and Harvard hates you and the TV hates you even when Jews aren’t on it.Listening to each other talk about hating youis an important part of their everyday life. The KKK dad in the movies, quizzing the kids about historical Jewish perfidies over breakfast, is a perverse confession.In Israel it’s the same. Scroll-thumpers are weird nerds. The demographic change there isn’t toward people who take books more seriously. It’s toward not being European. More violence, fewer apologies—and less universal explanations.

I learned this one up close and personal, having a seat at some ashkenazi tables as the token goy friend. I think they just kinda forgot I was there, or maybe the habit was too hard to break.

            Most Gazans support Hamas, so they are in fact mostly animals (although not entirely, since there are certainly normal people there). Pretending that, low IQ, third world Islamic creatures are equal to civilized, normal people is nonsense. We are not all equal and you can’t have civilization in proximity to these sorts of people.

                I don’t care if the Palestinians and Jews want to wipe out each other. However, I do care that Jews control Congress and thus force me to support one side.
That said, whites aren’t without agency. We let Jews take control of our country. That’s on us. But it’s long past time that Jews get to pretend otherwise. They run the country, so they have to take responsibility for where it goes.

                    It’s like you can blame someone for having unsafe sex and contracting AIDS, but you cannot really blame them for the course of the disease. The virus survives even if the host only lives long enough to be transmitted to new victims. Now that the chosen ones have have their very own statelet, they don’treallyeven need to concern themselves with that.

Check out his “The International Jew.” You can find a pdf online. It is AMAZING what our forebears knew. They tried. They tried and failed, because our merchant ruling class is just so damn corrupt and has been since long before any of us were born.

        From the Goldman column:a member of a universal Church that knew neither Greek nor Jew
That line “neither Greek nor Jew” is a reference to a verse from Paul in Galatians 3:28:
“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”
That “in Christ Jesus” is pretty important there. He’s speaking to Christians, some of them ethnic Jews, like Paul himself. It doesn’t apply to Jews who reject Christ.

            First lines of that ridiculous article: “Nations have historically looked to usurp Israel’s place in the Divine Plan.” Israel’s place in the Divine Plan was concluded when Jesus Christ was born. They were chosen to deliver the Messiah, and they did. So at that point, as Jesus said, it was time for them to join with all the nations and spread the good word – that’s the Divine Plan now. And yes, as you point out, many Jews joined with it.Not all, though. The ones who didn’t believe Jesus was an evil sorcerer who is boiling in excrement in hell right now. That is their prerogative and God will judge them for it as He judges us all. Yet accepting their belief in their own continued uniqueness and supremacy, as Goldman lays out in that article, also means that you are implicitly accepting their view of Jesus.

                This is actually fairly standard orthodox Lutheran theology.  (Others might be the similar but this is the one I know).   In general outline it comes from the nature of the Trinity, sola scriptura and By Grace Alone.  Adam and Eve and the pre-Abrahamic peoples of the Bible were Christians.  The People of Israel of the First Covenant with Abraham were also Christians. The First Covenant was absorbed into the Second Covenant, the saving grace of Christ Crucified, Resurrected, Ascended, and To Return.
What we now call Judaism is just a Christian heresy, like Gnosticism but much more Satanic.

                    Right. Since 325 AD, the official line is that Jesus = God, so anyone who worshipped God was also worshipping Jesus. Until Darby (I think) there was no notion of “dispensations” in the main theology, so modern Jews reject at least 1/3 of the divine, i.e., are heretics.
The upshot is that it’s not so much a matter of worship, but rather of choosing to live in accordance with the teachings, to the best of your ability, and to seek forgiveness when you fail.

Team B feels that the current political goals of the Zionists are more urgent than genocide. They are the ones who sold American industry and offered service in our stupid wars as an alternative to the displaced Whites.

        From the Lindsay Graham link:“When we were faced with destruction as a nation after Pearl Harbor, fighting the Germans and the Japanese, we decided to end the war by the bombing [of] Hiroshima [and] Nagasaki with nuclear weapons,” Graham said. “That was the right decision.”That’s actually a very apropos quote, because little Japan never represented an existential threat to the US. At all. And Gaza represents zero existential threat to Israel. Exactly the same. Obligatory: This is not a statement on the rightness of dropping the bombs on Japan, just an acknowledgment that neither nation is in a struggle for its very existence. In fact, as the Zman noted, this has undone so much progress with the saner Arab states involved in the Abraham Accords that, if anything, it has set Israel back decades in terms of its safety as a nation.

                    Also not quite correct.  Japan would surrender only with the Emperor being held harmless and retaining position/status.  We did not accept this as the Emperor was the very head of State and were concerned how such would appear—both to the Japanese and the allies.in any event, the Japanese did surrender unconditionally.  McArthur decided the Emperor would/could be useful in changing the culture of the Japanese at that time.  The Emperor played along and McArthur basically ran the country with the Emperor as figurehead. Had the Emperor been uncooperative, McArthur would have put him on the list of war criminals to be tried and been done with him.Fortunately, the Emperor and McArthur were decent people in the main and things worked out for the best.

                        Depends on how credible you believe Soviet records of the time to be, but the Yalta agreement of unconditional surrender definitely hamstrung US diplomatic efforts, while furthering Soviet interests. It also appears that Harriman’s efforts at Tehran were instrumental in giving Stalin all he needed at Yalta to force the US play.
I suspect that the real story is with Communist sympathizers and probable agents in the White House, a pro-Soviet postwar was all but baked in. Truman probably did the best he could with the hand he had.

                            That would have been reasonable,@roo_ster, but the US gave its word at Yalta. FDR was too big a fan of Stalin to have backed out, and much as I dislike Truman, he was an honorable man who would keep the promise.

                            Because the Emperor’s cooperation was an unknown variable.  McArthur sized up the Emperor’s usefulness upon taking control of Japan after surrender.  Prior to this, the Emperor’s cooperation was in doubt. If the Emperor was not on board with capitulation, he could have been troublesome to the occupation—indeed he could have been the figurehead of guerrilla activity in post war Japan.

Had Japan sought out someone else to broker the deal, maybe. But they did not. The rest is history.

At that time Japan had already been suing for peace for months. And most of the sernior US generals and admirals were against the use of nuclear weapons. This moron Graham doesn’t know any history.

What usually falls by the wayside in these discussions is that they were trying to get Stalin to broker a deal, when Stalin preferred no deal, to keep US out of Asia, so was running tanks to Manchuria as fast as they would go.

                    Yes, and Okinawa had shown that the Japs probably weren’t really on the verge of surrendering.  Plus Jap civilians were being trained to repel invasion.  And I believe there were die-hard high-level Jap generals who wanted to go down fighting.
It wasn’t a simple decision to drop the a-bombs.  And lots of American servicemen being readied for an invasion were grateful for what happened.  It’s too easy for us in hindsight to condemn Truman for his decision.
And thanks for your comment about using Hollywood for history.

                This is one thing the dissidents have never convinced me on. There were factions within the Japanese regime that wanted “peace,” but they didn’t have enough pull to make it happen. This is often misrepresented as the Japanese regime wanting peace. That’s my read on it anyway. Whether or not that makes the nukes the right call, I don’t know. But nuking Hiroshima or fire bombing Tokyo and Yokohoma, what’s the difference?

Good point. The fire bombing of Japanese cities was causing as much damage as the atomic bombs.

                    The Japs, for, as I understand it, “cultural reasons” could not be seen to be dealing directly with the US, so their whole push was to get Stalin to broker the deal. Truman was hoping to starve them out, like how the English brought Germany to the table after WWI. But Stalin was rolling his mechanized troops from West to East as fast as they could go. Truman was left with the choice of a massive landing, let Stalin have everything, or drop nukes.

                “…most of the sernior US generals and admirals were against the use of nuclear weapons. “
Really, how do you/we know this?  One bomb had been tested in the middle of the desert a few weeks or so before.  The test witnessed by a handful of people—certainly not the big brass in the Pentagon—and with no mock structures as in follow-up tests.  Big flash, lots of heat, etc. but nothing to compare/measure/understand such destruction.
Sounds to me like a convenient “reinterpretation” of the history of the event in light of our pathetic and continuing angst over the “bomb”.  I call BS.

                There was no need to drop nukes on Japan.  Japan was not self-suffient in any number of resources, to include food.  Blockade their ports and let them starve was the best approach.  If they did not surrender and let their population starve, it would be on the Japs.  Instead, we murdered yet more civvies in terror bombings, this time with atomic hellfire.

                        Yep, nonsense.  So we blockade and cruelly starve millions of civilians in order to not use an atomic bomb—of unknown effect at the time and which even if one-hundred percent effective would have killed a few hundred thousand “civilians”?Clue: There are no “civilians” in total war.  That included Japan, where much of the war supplies were produced in smallish workshops among the civilian population centers.The “bomb” was the most appropriate weapon for the time and the Bushido mindset of the Japanese leadership.  As I’ve stated before, the Japanese could not know how many nuke weapons we possessed, but they did know two things: We had hundreds of  B-29 bombers, and Only one weapon by one bomber was unleashed upon each city.The nuke weapon breakthrough and potential was confirmed by the Japanese physicists (a nuke weapon possibility was no secret among scientists of the time).  This presented the Japanese leadership with a very real dilemma: Continue the war and watch a hundred B-29’s attack Japan with nukes, each one eliminating a city at a time, and thereby the complete and utter annihilation of the Japanese people/civilization, or surrender and save the Japan people from *extinction*. Even then, the Busihdo mindset was to die rather than surrender—even with the very real possibility looming of Japanese extinction as a people.The bombing gave the sensible people in leadership the edge they needed in ending the war, with the Emperor stepping in and settling the matter—no sense being the Emperor over the world’s largest grave yard.

                The Japanesehadbeen trying to surrender. Their government hoped to preserve the emperor, but was prepared to accept almost any terms. Diplomats in countries with whom Japan had relations (which at the time included the Soviet Union) were instructed by the American government to ignore these efforts to surrender.The Americans had just two atomic bombs prepared and available in theater.They had already leveled every Japanese city of any size except two: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So, if the Japanese were trying to surrender, why was the U.S. so determined to nuke them?To end the war with minimal casualties. This ignores Japanese peace efforts; but if casualties really were the issue, a blockade of the home islands could have starved them out eventually. But even if it didn’t, the Americans had no more large urban concentrations left to bomb (nor A-bombs with which to do so); thereby rendering the threat meaningless.To intimidate the Soviets. This is almost certainly apocryphal. Although the Soviets may have harbored suspicions, the Cold War was not yet a thing and the Western allies remained mostly optimistic about the Soviets. But if theyweretrying to affect Russian policy, demonstrating exclusive use of a doomsday weapon is hardly a path to peaceful coexistence.To test out the new wonder weapon. Testing the practicality and explosive potential of a new wonder weapon in the New Mexico desert using your own troops as hapless guinea pigs is not nearly as satisfying as using it on your equally helpless enemies. B-29 bombers carrying the A-bombs flew unescorted as Japanese air defense was almost nonexistent.

            “When we were faced with destruction as a nation after Pearl Harbor,”From all that I have read, I feel certain that FDR knew that the Pearl Harbor attack would happen, down to the exact date, and that he not only intentionally provoked it and but did all he could to make sure if was as gory as possible. And there is evidence that FDR was part Jewish, and that he and his close Jewish advisors set the attack up because they were itching to get isolationist America to be enthusiastic for war with Germany.When people on MSNBC and in The Atlantic say, “January 6th was just like Pearl Harbor, the JFK assassination, and 9/11”, my reaction usually is, “You mean Jews had a hand in January 6th too?”

‘Course he knew it — he provoked it. That’s what the oil and steel embargo was designed to do and why he cold-shouldered Japanese diplomatic efforts leading up to Pearl Harbor. WW2 was a tussle between empires and would-be-empires. The Japanese lost, as did the Germans, the Brits, and possibly the French. The USA was the big winner and a bloodied and traumatised USSR was also not a loser.

        The long allergy to thinking about the role of Jews in these foreign projects is gone and now you see things in the public square with regard to the role of Jews in politics that would not have seen the light of day a few decades ago.The next lost allergy will be the thinking about the role of Jews in finance. De-Judaizing American financial institutions may not be even possible but that’s where this is leading. People have noticed things. More and more of those people, as you point out, do not share the moral consensus about Israel. Many of those people are outright hostile to Jews, who ironically had a wildly disproportionate role in bringing them here. Reaping, sowing…This changing of the guard inside IsraelIt appears to be an outright civil war.Just compare Nick Fuentes to Kevin MacDonald and you can see the change.I don’t understand this, to be honest, and if you or someone else could explain it, that would be awesome. Tone?That means the multipolar world and the new American politics are a mortal threat. The panic we are seeing, whether genuine or purchased as in the case of Republican politicians, is the result of the great change that is about to sweep the American empire.While the typical Normiecon GOP voter is very philo-Semitic and pro-Israel, even they are seeing the jaw-dropping disparity between the concern for their issues vs. the elected Republicans’ prioritizing Israel. It increasingly looks like the GOP knows its long con is coming to an end and is like the rest of the apparat furiously looting as fast as it can. Massie will survive. The interesting race is the one that involves Mast, who also will survive. His Republican opponent is anti-Israel. That may mark an inflection point. Israel isn’t the only place a slow-motion civil war is brewing.

Like I said, at the same time oligarchs were hoovering up all of the Soviet Union’s best asset, we also had an avalanche of newly minted Jewish billionaires. We need our own Putin to set them straight.

        Here is Ted Cruz claiming that no one came to the aid of Jews in the Second World War and that Israel has had to go it alone.
Menachem Begin used that same line on Biden, of all people, way back in the ’80s. It was as ludicrous then as it is today. It was one of the two or three times I’ve agreed with Biden, but he didn’t have the courage to stick to his position (of course, he’s run screaming from all those positions). And pretty illuminating that they are still using the very same talking points.

        The Israelis aren’t stupid.   They’ve seen the demographic changes that the diaspora here have helped create and know that their once reliable American golem is on the outs.    The Ukrainian debacle proves that.    This is one last hurrah before it collapses, infested and drained of blood.

        I could be full a beans… but I don’t think the jews just ‘went nuts’ after the Hamas attack. You may need a tin foil hat to follow my train of thought, but:The Israelis did not go bonkers after the Hamas attack. Elements of their Clown network certainly did as we see in the media pundits that you point out. It is obvious to even the mildest Dissident that it was designed to make YOU crazy too. Unfortunately they went off the deep end and had the opposite effect – The wanks on Blab had a field day with rotten memes and jokes about the lies of broiled, decapitated jewish babbies. I laughed like everyone else.Notice that after that attack the Blame Machine was shut down. Cooler heads in Israel  asked, “How did our intelligence assets fail so badly with this? Why were our people in such an unusual state unpreparedness? Etc etc – you know the drill… but in record time the inquiries were shut down and the media was forbidden from broaching the subject again. All mouths and bullhorns were re-focused on Arab atrocities and innocent, helpless jewish victims.I strongly suspect it was all planned in advance. Bibi – for a time – controlled the United States. He had a window of opportunity to destroy the Gaza and he went all in while the the winds were in his favour. He chose to strike while the iron was hot. He literally has nothing to lose. When this adventure inevitably fails, his part and that of his gov’t (and America’s) will be whitewashed by the media. The US, being the ever present Good Guys, will probably accept hundreds of thousands of Palistinkians to help ease the demographic population problem in Israel. But – never mind that!!!! The Next Current Thing is already on the drawing board – rest assured.Unfortunately for Bibi (and fortunately for the Palies) the iron cooled too fast to work it. We see this with the increasing shrieks of alarm from the Usual Suspects about mounting Auntie Semitism from those awful white legacy Americans.The stage was set for this lunacy decades ago. All that is happening now is that the spinning plates of lies and deceit are starting to slow and fall, and we will truly live in interesting times. God is gearing up to punish those a-holes (again) and we’d better pray we get a pass… but you are judged by the company you keep. That does not bode well for us at all.

                It boggles the mind how many people have a problem with this notion. They project their values onto the Jews, who do not share them. Remember 911? I was in the DoD at the time, and I can tell you that it was crystal clear 3 weeks after the attack that either one of two things was true: the Israelis knew and didn’t tell us or that the Israelis knew and told us and ‘our’ own people stood down and let it happen. I’m not 100% certain, but am inclined to the former simply because I don’t think ‘our’ side could have kept a lid on it, not even now and definitely not back then.My first epiphany about the oft-time Prime Minister Netanyahu’s capability (a manifestation of Jewish mentality) came when watching an informal interview he gave at a West Bank settlement a long time, when he was out of power iirc. One of the settlers (in American English) asked about American opposition to their project and Net answered “Don’t worry about. America is a thing easily moved.”I hated that guy after that, but I was young and retarded. You should never be angry at someone for telling you the truth. Our ruling class have been complete money-grubbing whores bending over for the money for at least 150 years. We have been so easily moved by so many, so malevolent, for so very long, that our country (our civilizational pattern) has been destroyed. Netanyahu is ruthless in looking out for his own kind. He should be emulated, not despised. We should be just as pitilessly ruthless in getting a new country. He is an enemy, but he taught me an important lesson. Nice guys finish last, and nice peoples get exterminated if they extend the nice to the outgroup.

            I think the suspicion always was that this was “queued” up and that they were looking for any excuse to implement it.  Thus the weird, outsized response as they only had the one response in the can and they didn’t care if it didn’t “fit”.  The other thought too is that they know the GAE bar is about to close so this is their “last call” order (“bring me one of everything!!“)

        “It does not explain why the Israelis seem willing to offend their supporters in America.”The Mizrahi (a tiger that Netanyahu has by the tail) don’t know or understand much about the white West, and they probably don’t have that many links with diaspora Ashkenazi Jews in Europe and North America. The Holocaust doesn’t mean much to them as they weren’t the ones affected and so they’re not bothered about resurgent anti-semitism in the West.As for Lindsey Graham, this sodomite of South Carolina is a disgrace to the human species. But he’s only slightly more hysterical and vocal than a broad swathe of other North American politicians. There must be something about homosexuality that makes for hysteria, I suppose.As for the way things are going, I don’t see things clearly. I still like the metaphor of a chess grandmaster playing a patzer. The patzer can see his position is going down the drain but he makes irrelevant and unnecessarily damaging moves, whereas a master in the same position would consolidate, and make moves relevant to the defense of a bad position. The morons at the helm of the empire are making the empire go down the drain twice as fast as it needs to.A new Fuhrer will eventually emerge, I suppose or I hope. The Lisan al Gaib, the Mahdi.

        I have traditionally been reluctant to call out Jewish control of the GAE, wanting to have my ducks in a row with specific examples to point to, which I usually lacked, other than pointing out the high number of them in powerful positions, which doesn’t exactly convince normie. But now…… it’s like they’re doing all the work for me. Even for normie who doesn’t want to see it, the evidence is undeniable, if you merely point it out. When I saw that letter from the 12 R senators to the ICC, my first thought was, “what if they made threats like that against the pro immigration blob?” A guy can dream.Unfortunately, I think it’s more likely for the jews to throw their support behind the Rs than it is for there to be any successful purge of them. If the “left” is too split by “anti-semitism” to hold onto power, then the jews will weather the storm in the available port that’s eager to accept them. Normie will be only too happy to cast his vote for the BOM, regardless of any deals he makes with the small hats, and no amount of Noticing can prevent that.

            I didn’t think that Trump had a chance, but, now, I’m thinking he might. The GOP is 100% on Team Jew and so is Trump. Biden is 100% on Team Jew, but the Dems have a lot of dissenters.
Trump wins in 2024.

                    Even if they can’t, one thing they can do is make election denial great again. Prosecute it and make the courts hear it. Garfinkel’s DOJ leading the charge. Make the media portray that effort in a favorable light. It would be quite the irony, but I can picture it.
This would have the added effect of restoring normie’s faith in the electoral process.

                Doubtful. There is a very strong possibility the election will be blatantly, even-more-undeniably stolen and anyone who complains is arrested or otherwise silenced. Based on Covid compliance, don’t expect too many to complain. The complacency changes the nanosecond people are plunged into poverty. AINO will collapse suddenly at that point. The only scenario where Trump is allowed to claim a victory (and it be honored) is if there is a plan to have him holding the bag in the midst of the aforementioned economic collapse or if he is pegged to act as a Judas goat to get young white males to line up as cannon fodder for a War ‘o the Week–maybe both. It is a parlor game to guess how much longer this can stagger along, but my timeline keeps getting pushed closer to the present. To be clear, I expect that day to be godawful even if inevitable.

I agree there is vastly disproportionate Jewish influence. But self-evidently, “we” are more than capable of doing it to “ourselves”.

            No. It is every last one of them. I, like J. Zoar or some other poster have a lot of contact, and every last one calls Gazans all animals and they will tell you to your face that America is a stepping stone to an ever stronger and greater Israel – without even knowing that is what they are saying. They will tell you to your face that America is no longer a white Christian country and then ramble on about how they are unabashed Zionists ready to join up with the JDL – of course without joining up the JDL but still using the non-white non-Christian former USA as toilet paper.The levels of self absorption are astounding. The most red pilling thing you could ever do is invite some ab-normies to a dinner party and they would be astounded by the total lack of regard for anything but themselves.As for the post today, that Goldman article is truly astounding. It looks to me like things are going completely mask off and all but a formal, prime-time TV announcement of occupied rule is coming. For us it has already come but I mean a National Emergency type address where it is announced that Netanyahu is being made Supreme Ruler of Zion and via the North American Annexation Proclamation the President of the United States.

        “Hereis Ted Cruz claiming that no one came to the aid of Jews in the Second World War”This narrative is maddening.  Despite the fact that Germans were one of the largest ethnic groups in America at the time, we spent enormous blood and treasure fighting Germany and then spent another over 1/2 a century holding them down and occupying them.The demographic replacement of White people and social media both play a role in the anti-Israel sentiment.  All these imported brown people who see Jews as just another group of Whites, ethnic hatred for Jews by Arabs and social media broadcasting the ethnic cleansing of Gaza along with liberal Jews comes together to oppose what they are doing in Gaza.Earlier generations were not exposed to the realities of these “lawn mowing” operations in the Middle East.  We got our information from the press who toned down the realities of these periodic flare ups.  Israeli soldiers have the same social media disease as everyone else and are uploading selfies with dead or mutilated Palestinians or wreckage and rubble.  So now anyone who wants to see the reality can see it.

Their pivotal role in doing this to our country and lying to us about it at the same time, is is also a very large source of our hostility, or at least mine. So it’s not only the brown people hostile to them, it’s people like me hostile to them for dumping all these brown people into this country.

They have no idea the anger levels and the furyYou know, when Stephen Steinleighter wrote his 2001 paper discussing the problem with too much immigration upsetting Jewish power he proposed allying with Asians to divide and conquer. In the entire paper he never once mentions Gentiles – Americans.The rank and file have no clue the white hot rage that is burning in the hearts of the dispossessed. This episode has ripped the mask off. I promise you that episode with Scott Adams the other day is happening all over Boomer ville. The question now though, is how to constructively channel that rage.

        I liked Spengler for years; I think I started reading him around 9/11, when I discovered a lot of writers who were new to me.  But something went wrong with him several years ago, maybe it was a midlife crisis, which affects some people by making them turn back to their religious roots with a vengeance. Anyway, he seemed to turn into Super Jew, and it seemed that 80% of his columns were focused on Judaism. Even that wouldn’t be so bad, but he just wouldn’t stay in his lane, and kept making observations about Christianity that really annoyed me.  He seems to believe that Christians ought to be Jews, or think they are Jews, or want to be Jews and don’t know it, or are trying to be Jews and just don’t know how. He can’t seem to accept that Jewishness may be the center of the universe as far as he’s concerned, but really isn’t something that Christians think about at all.

            Just like how the progressives believe we obsess on race solely because they obsess on race.  Since they hate you and want you dead, they just assume you hate them and want them dead and might lash out at any moment.  Admittedly, everyone projects to some extent, but the progressives really, really project.There is a second aspect which is the resentment deep in their black little hearts. Our small hatted friends are particularly susceptible to this among the progressives.  I try to imagine how it would feel as a White Christian in China.  I don’t know how I would react, but it is certainly understandable.

        So Goldman in his attempt to tell those evil Christians to suck it up, and remember Israel is special, essentially argued that Jews can only be loyal to Jews?  A Christian has certain hierarchies and responsibilities.  The Jew as the Chosen of God only has Jews and Israel.
BTW, his first paragraph is historically illiterate.  Israel was unified for a whole three kings.  That included a few overthrow attempts.  As a unified nation, they were a blip.

        Remedy matters.
The natural response to the ever-increasing insanity is to get viscerally angry and want to slit someone’s throat. Those are the wages of endless beyond-the-pale escalation of the madness that currently afflicts us. But rash emotional outbursts are not an effective solution, even if supremely satisfying in the moment. Every day, Hamas fighters in Gaza spring up out of seeming nowhere and launch homemade rockets into IDF armored vehicles. That’s a tangible realty that the Zionists cannot ignore or paper over with bribes, political blackmail, or MSM propaganda. Watch and learn.

        “Project Ukraine is looking like the Varian Disaster for the American empire.“
The Varian disaster was at the beginning or perhaps midpoint of the height of the Roman Empire, the decline only beginning to be noticeable more than a century later.  Our Varian disaster was Vietnam.  This truly was the inflection point for the GAE.  It is now, 50 years later our decline is undeniable and obvious to those who care to look.

        The Jewish Century is coming to an end; we are soon going to have an interregnum where Muslims and Hindus vie to be the new puppetmasters and colonizers of the West, though the Hindus will eventually win out over the quarrelsome Muslims.

        There are a couple of reasons for Israel’s shift rightwards:1) Attitudes of Israelis towards the Palestinians have hardened significantly since the 2000 Intifada and the breakdown of the Oslo agreements. More than two decades of on-off war and terrorism, now understanding that their enemies have no wish for peace.2) While the Israeli Left – like the Left throughout the West – is not breeding but rather embracing homosexuality, childlessness, etc. the Right is popping out babies like no tomorrow. Someone like Ben Gvir (admirer of Baruch Goldstein and Meir Kahane) would NEVER have been in government 20 years ago. Now he is a player to be reckoned with, appeased even.So this could kind of be our future here…maybe Nick Fuentes is Ben Gvir?

        Here’s how the last attempt to build the Third Temple ended: “Julian thought to rebuild at an extravagant expense the proud Temple once at Jerusalem, and committed this task toAlypius of Antioch. Alypius set vigorously to work, and was seconded by thegovernor of the province; when fearful balls of fire, breaking out near the foundations, continued their attacks, till the workmen, after repeated scorchings, could approach no more: and he gave up the attempt.— Ammianus Marcellinus, The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, Book 23, Chapter 1, Line 3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple

This guy has been a regular at PJ Media (or was) over 10 years and regularly engaged readers in the comments.  IMO, he never wore a mask, even back before I had the JQ awakening, his opinion on matters regarding the middle east were IMO insane. He’s one of the reasons I left that website, to Include Glenn Reynold’s Instapundit, for good.

            Could not agree more, although I never feel my own slipping. But for those that do, don’t let books like “Night” and “Diary” put you off even if they are seen by some as fan fic. The bottom line is they transmit feelings and emotions that communicate to one and all what it is all about and that is the best thing anyone can expect from the epic human tragedy that trumps all other events in the history of mankind. To think and act otherwise will soon get you behind bars in this land is our land, this land is your land.

                Neither Egypt nor Jordan want any Palestinians. Nobody wants them.

The rest left and many of those went to Lebanon, which they proceeded to wreck..Egypt has built a big, beautiful wall to keep Palestinians out.I can’t blame Israel for wanting to be rid of them.The “Biden” “Administration” is said to be preparing to import an unspecified number of  Palestinian “refugees”, thereby strengthening our diversity.I can hardly wait for the Somalis start fighting the Palestinians in American cities.

                    The analogy of Somalis and Palis is a good one. Diversity is dreadful, but some diversity is even more horrific than the rest. Somalis and Palis are the worst of the diverse.

                    This is what I fear.  You are spot on.  The Palestinians have been driven from every Arab country they have “fled” to—and not because of some prejudice, but because of their subversive actions within their host country.   No one wants these degenerates—except of course—potentially, the  USA.  Heaven help us if they arrive in our shores.

                More likely – the Israelis herd them all towards that floating pier we are building and they get sealifted out to be dumped in American cities.

                    There will be plenty of anti-Palestinian sentiment once the new arrivals collide with the normies, the legacy blacks, the currently-swelling mixed illegal population and the Somalis over welfare benefits, turf and political power.
Nobody will think of Israel when that goes down.

                                But that’s the issue. If Israel wants them out of Israel,  then go back to the 1947 borders (e.i., GTFO). If Israel wants to genocide them, then too bad if they fight back. From what I can tell,  they deserve each other.

Of course, because far be it from the classically-educated American to be able to understand who was running the sealift, let alone the obvious solution — sink the damn ships.

                            I mean, it was better, in a way. The Irish mostly kept the diversity in their own neighborhoods, rarely allowing them to loot the Miracle Mile or the affluent suburbs, but Daley II wasn’t anywhere near the man his dad was in keeping the violence in check.
But some of the worst started under Byrne.

                                Exactly. Someone a ways back said the problem is it’s hard to hold a chair over your head. Richard J. Daley (and the other old-time Democrats) didn’t do that. They just picked it up whenever they needed to brain one when they got out of line, and the rest were cowed. All he had to do is point to the chair now and again.
Modern Democrats pander to the ferals, so of course they act out. I’m not excusing the chimps. Just saying that not even Sweden could make socialism work, with a homogenous Nordic population at the time.

                                    It’s much easier to keep a small populace of nuggras in line than a huge one. In 1949 Chicago’s black population was fairly minimal and the city was a great place to live. But by 1969 negroes had become a very large minority and huge sections of Chi-town had become Shit-town.

                                        All I was able to find were the census figures, so decades. 1940 was about 10%, 1950 about 23%, 1960 about 29%, where it’s been ever since.
Homicide rate in 1960 still 10 per 100k, 1970, 30 per 100k, now 22 per 100k. With all having roughly the same ratio of blacks, and a slightly shrinking total number of blacks.
There’s something else at work.

                        And yet the Grillers will look at the Hiroshima-Nagasaki/Detroit-Chicago configuration and blame the disparity on Democratic rule in the latter.
When a Grillers comment on the deterioration of a large blue city, you can depend on one to say how many years have elapsed since the last Republican mayor. This is one of the most annoying things about Grillers and the first sign of an especially deluded one

                            In the case of Chicago, D or R never really mattered. Not for at least a century. NY may have invented American corruption, and Jersey improved it, but Chicago took it to an artform.
And corruption there took the form of cracking down on cops, while extending the Jussie Smollet treatment to all ferals, regardless of the number they rape or kill.

        Zman: “The public has clearly changed. The long allergy to thinking about the role of Jews in these foreign projects is gone and now you see things in the public square with regard to the role of Jews in politics that would not have seen the light of day a few decades ago.”Mearsheimer and Walt’s “The Israeli Lobby”, 2007 got the ball rolling to discuss the issue in polite, educated company.What Israel is doing to the Palestinians now accelerated it to warp speed.  So, in that sense, all is going according to Hamas’ big, last ditch move on October 7.  (A major side intent was to prevent Saudi Arabia from interlocking with Israel. As the Saudis were about to do, but now cannot).However, as Hamas surely realized, the risk they took on the 7th in the name of Palestinian self-respect, and the respect to their Never Surrender forefathers, is the risk that their people may be genocided into oblivion.  If that is the outcome, well at least history will remember that the Palestinians went out with their boots on, and with a big f*cking Oktoberfest bang!

        Slightly OT, but does anyone have a link to a good, comprehensive description of what seems to have really happened on Oct. 7 last year in Israel?  I know that there were apparently some fake stories about atrocities committed by Hamas, but also that it seems they really did commit a lot of horrible stuff.  I’m not really on either side but would just like to know more.

            I doubt we’ll ever know for sure.  Supposedly, the Israelis have this horrific video showing all of the atrocities.  It’s never seen the light of day.  My best educated guess:The raid involved a large number of Muslim men, plus included individuals and small groups taking advantage of the situation.  Therefore, yes I am confident in saying that rapes, and brutalities did occur.  I doubt though that they were as widespread or as horrific as claimed.  It was likely the horrors of war type of thing with maybe a handful, at most, of really gruesome acts.The IDF response was clumsy and seemed to involve shooting anything that moved.  This increased the death toll.Everyone over there is lying.  Assume that and you will be on safe ground.

        I disagree on this Z-Man, the global question is the inevitable fruit of the Colors of Benetton: “Team White or Team Anti-White?”The FT did an article on the Israeli left and peace movement. After 10/7 they have abandoned any hope or desire to make peace as they see it as impossible due to the extreme atrocities of 10/7 and more shocking to them, the glee in which the parents / relatives of the perps reacted to the livestreaming. It was not JUST the atrocities themselves but the Gazan reaction to them: joy, the erased any desire for peace or agreement. EVEN the most liberal Ashkenazi want most / all Gaza dead.And the recurring theme in the FT interviews was that the Ashkenazi Left saw themselves as soft, weak, and insufficiently scary to those who really, really want them dead. Bibi is likely the moderate in any who would replace him as PM. [Demographic changes are important in Israel, but the shock of 10/7 likely more important.]In the West, the protests are non-organic and organized by the flood of Soros/CIA/Qatar/Iran money. It is just another Color Revolution aimed at the Biden Regime. The protests all have the same tents, the same professional anti-Fa seen in the Summer of George, and the same racial politics. Those protesting are Muslimas, AWFL “Bottomless Mimosa anti-fa”*, ugly White lesbians, anti-Fa, and various mystery meat dudes. Those counter-protesting are White frat guys who see the Palestinian Flag as a symbol of anti-White.Underneath this is the desperate attempt to “keep the old gang together” by Schumer and Biden -Schumer asking for regime change in Israel, witholding of arms to Israel by Biden. While Team Anti-White has kicked a certain people out of their coalition, ending the “Dont Mess with the Zohan” strategy of teaming up to hate YT. Bill Ackman was excoriated in some Beverly Hills Media summit by various non White bigshots as being anti people of color, and he fired right back. Ascendant non-Whites are no longer willing to tolerate a certain people occupying positions of power or influence, being at top Universities (those spots belong to “them”) and so forth. This is a function of changing demographics in the US and the DEI initiative to replace YT with people of color at the top.White people still support Israel because they are Team White. Indeed the more Team Anti-White opposes Israel the more Team White supports it — up to a point.Goldman? He’s been writing the same Orthodox stuff: His people have a timeless Covenant with God, Europeans worship their traditions and people which get erased by time. I am not orthodox so this stuff over the past 15 years has no interest for me.The protests which are ongoing seem to be Obama/Soros/CIA aimed at removing Biden so that Obama can “step in” to “save Democracy” by ruling forever like his pal Zelensky. Again another non-organic, CIA directed Color Revolution.*White rich liberal women will support any cause that allows them to wear scarves. Not my original observation btw.

            Replying to my own comment, it is interesting to note that Biden has offered “intel” on Hamas exact leadership location in tunnels if Israel does not invade Rafah. How indeed would the US know that? Only through close, constant communication with senior Hamas officials. Lost in this is that the US under Obama, and resumed under Biden (Trump had ended it), is that the US has directly paid Hamas, and also Iran (to the tune of billions). The US may or may not have known about 10/7 in advance, but they certainly have a close working relationship with Hamas to the point where they know where the leadership hides, if you believe the offer.Iran has basically through the Houthi proxies ended all Western transit through the Red Sea and Suez Canal ending Egypt’s transit money. The US Navy’s response has been ineffective and weak. This is partially because significant parts of the Democratic bureaucracy are bought and paid for by Iran; and partly because the US Navy just can do much being an aging, technologically obsolete, woke disaster.Lesson: demographic change away from an overwhelming White majority brings catastrophic weakness and decline. Only a non-White President would have aided Hamas and Iran, and only a President deeply indebted to non Whites would have continued that policy. A non-White majority US has the Naval Power of Guatemala.

                Assuming that wasn’t just a BidenGaffe, there must have been some reason to let everyone know we have HUMINT embeds the Mossad does not. It really can’t be to pressure Hamas — they could simply relocate and send the CIA assets home in pieces. If a bunch of Palis get tortured to death to root out the real spies, who cares? Hamas has shown no qualms about using them as human shields, anyway.
The most plausible explanation I have is that Hamas leadership is already in Raafah…

        The failure of State Department wars of the last 60 (100?) years does not necessarily make the American Military a “paper tiger”. There’s a danger in reading too much militarily in the coming Russian victory in the Ukraine. As much as I enjoy the comeuppance of the neocon class, extrapolating the destruction of a few stripped down 40-year-old M1 Abrams, or the coming destruction of the stripped down soon to be poorly maintained and piloted F-16s in to the American military as a “paper tiger” is fatuous. Putin, by the way, knows this, which is why he has been very very meticulous in refusing to be baited in to a wider war.

            Good comment!  There are aspects of the American military that are very effective, albeit at a very high price.  But I do wonder about the quality of the personnel that would have to do the fighting.  Special forces and Navy SEALS remain quite good, but I wonder how a run-of-the-mill US Army mechanized brigade would fare if it had to face the Russians presently fighting in the Donbass.  And how would the Navy fare if it had to constantly defend its carrier task forces against swarms of cruise missiles and drones.  Maybe not a paper tiger but an old one with missing claws and teeth.

                I have reservations about how well a regular brigade or even division would fare over there. Been a very long time since American soldiers had to worry about air attacks, significant incoming artillery, or their logistics being severed.

                    Good insight!  I’ve often suspected that the US Navy would be more troubled by the loss of a fast attack submarine than an aircraft carrier.  And diesel electric submarines are pretty formidable in a littoral environment.  Also, I wonder how many attacks a submarine can make before it needs to be rearmed.  I’ve read that the US has few or no submarine tenders, so the submarines would have to return to a suitable base; not a good basis for a sustained campaign.

                        You are mostly right except for one thing, a sub is a quiet loss. A carrier and probably a carrier group on the bottom would be an apocalypse for the US in the war of perception that matters much more to the GAE. A sub going down is about 100 or so people and quiet. A carrier is 5000 or so and leaves a big hole in the ocean.
Remember perception is reality for the empire now. That’s why a single tank destroyed on video gets more attention than a thousand ukes buried in trenches.

                        I’m afraid those are probably compromised personnel-wise anyway. Another blogger posted a video last week of a Captain’s Mast and it was taking place on an Ohio Class missile boat. The subject of the mast was some ghetto groid who appeared before the Captain in his dress whites which were disheveled: his pants were undone in the front and his dress blouse was in tatters. How he was allowed to stand before the skipper like that, I don’t know. As the captain began to read the charges (among them, leaving his post) this mutt kept yelling out, “Dats bullshit!”, after the second time he blurted it out, the COB began yelling at him to shut up.my only thought was that this is a nuclear missile submarine, the sailors on these boats are supposed to be a huge cut above the average. My only thought was – (besides what the hell is the navy thinking allowing this troglodyte on a multi-billion dollar piece of advanced equipment?) we’re so totally fucked.

                Given that white recruitment to the military is down more than 40% from 2018, you can bet that the technical side of the military and the combat units are hurting for qualified soldiers.
Whites are now just 44% of the military recruits. Given the turnover in the military, that means in a few years, whites will be a minority in the military overall. Given that blacks and Hispanics are add nothing, this means that our military is really only half as big as we say it is.

                A regular Army battalion under intense artillery fire would fall apart in the current year.  In the cold war the Army was mentally prepared for a massive Red Army onslaught with chemical weapons and tactical nukes raining down.
Forty years using high-tech weaponry to push around primitives has made the regulars soft.

            In a conflict that stays conventional against a near peer it is obvious that the West is a paper tiger.   The biggest problem is that the United States no longer has the industrial capacity to fight a war with Russia or China.   Worse, there is no easy path to bring that industrial capacity back.   Those multi billion dollar aircraft carriers are obsolete against Russia or China and it takes the better part of a decade to build one.Perhaps most of all the U.S. no longer has the social capitol it would take to build or maintain an industrial capacity for a near peer conflict.   The national IQ is now well under 100.The Ukrainians were the best proxy military the West ever fielded.   They were far ahead of the Russians at the start of the war.   The Russians overcame that in two years because they had the capacity to bring back their military industrial capacity.   The U.S. does not.

                    Interesting.  The “real output” measured includes “mining” and “electric and gas utilities”.   Does “mining” include oil drilling/fracking?  All that together might explain the big short recent drops tracking economic crises, especially if there was relatively little manufacturing capacity to cushion those drops.  No one doubts that our energy use has soared.  If that together with other industrial capacity is flat it looks like our manufacturing capacity might have cratered.  Food for thought and further inquiry.  Thanks!

                Excellent comment. The loss of industrial capacity and the lack of logistical support for a sustained war effort has made the US a one trick pony.
The nukes were built by the slide rule guys so that might be our only legitimate threat. The outcome is anyone’s guess considering the counter measures we have. If the target country has good counter measures they would be a colossal failure.
I am not sure we have the ability to assess our strength and weakness. Most likely it’s guessing or wishful thinking.

        Panic is panic.  It’s an emotional reaction, not a logical one.  The voices scream louder to shout down dissent.  We saw the same silly screaming during COVID as the “science” became increasingly suspect.  Even my ordinarily pro-Israel, evangelical Christian, sister is muted on this war.Like it or not, we are witnessing something Rush Limbaugh noted about the region back in the 90’s and early 00’s:  nobody is ever allowed to win.  Somebody, usually the US, swoops in and negotiates a cease fire.  Both sides kick their wounds.  Nobody wins.  And they reload for the next fight.  The drubbing the Israelis are inflicting might result in a clear victor.  If Hamas sues for peace, instead of a cease fire, we’ll know.  Both groups are basically disliked in every country they go to.  It’s like watching your sister’s ignorant degenerate ex husband get into a bar fight with the local miscreant drug dealer.As far as American weapons go, the Ukes are fighting without air superiority.  That’s something we’ve known you need since WW2.  They’re also unable to hit the Russians behind their lines like the US would.  We couldn’t be invulnerable, nor were we in Vietnam, but the ability to hit behind the lines is necessary.The Russians have been forced to grind through 2 years of war against an inferior adversary ON THEIR BORDER despite total superiority, and uninhibited flows of supplies across their unthreatened border.  They have, in 2 years, moved a couple hundred miles?The Wehrmacht, they ain’t.  Russia has been careful not to expand the war because they’re winning the war 53-47 not 90-10.

            To again cite Rushbo, the Russians are doing this with one arm tied behind their backs just to make it fair. They were a little slow to figuring out how to deal with drone warfare, and it’s clear their electronic warfare is not what we were told it was, but quantity has a quality of it’s own. Hundreds of 40 YO Soviet tanks against ten 40 YO Abrams tanks is no contest.

                That’s not a defeat of American weapons.  We maintain fewer tanks because tanks are easy to destroy from the air.  Just ask the Ukes.  Or the Iraqis.  US doctrine is AirPower forward.
Thats the main reason why we haven’t seen much military air supplied to Ukraine.  They’d use it to attack targets inside Russia until the Russians shoot them all down.

                Respectful disagreement: “the Russians are doing this withone arm tied behind their backs” because the OVERWHELMING parameter in their warfighting strategy is preservation of their fighting men. The want to win, and not just against the stupid Ukies, but against the globalist-controlled institutions of NATO and the EU with the least possible number of their men killed. If it takes longer, that’s fine. They have endless time. If they have to make tactical retreats to preserve force structure (save THEIR lives) that’s fine. They have endless space.What they don’t have, and neither does anyone else, is endless quality white manpower to waste. The civilizational strategic victory is going to be won by whoever has the most quality white men properly trained and harnessed not just to defend but to build their civilization. It’s why they send in criminals in probing waves: you expend your least valuable human resources if you can. The globohomos crowing about Russia being on their last legs because they are using criminals are just utter morons. We (the WEST) went through this in WW1 when we sent the young cream of the crop of scientists and engineers to die in the trenches in 1914-1916. We didn’t make that mistake in WW2, but historical literacy isn’t one of globohomo’s strengths.

                    Agreed. I was being glib with the “just to make it fair.” No one seeks to make war “fair”. Men are expensive and just shy of irreplaceable. Artillery shells are cheap, at least those not made by or for NATO.

            How did that war work out for the Wehrmacht in the end?
Another clueless armchair general moaning that Russia isn’t moving fast enough for them as they slowly and deliberately win the war.

            The Russians probably don’t want to overrun all of Ukraine. It’s a good guess they want to destroy the Ukrainian military, get control of the Russian-speaking areas and leave a demilitarized Ukrainian rump state as somebody else’s problem–and do this at minimal cost while having a stronger military at the end.
Things seem to be going that way. A Wehrmacht-style invasion would not accomplish this and, anyway, in 2022 Russia did not have the resources to do it.

                Actually, their strategy is the same as in Georgia: lop off just enough of the country to take NATO membership off the table without risking a larger insurgent conflict in areas that aren’t ethnic Russian.  I’ve said that for 2 years.
They’ve largely been successful.  They have limited goals for a limited conflict because this is all their military can accomplish.

                    Successful so far. The long run problem for Russia is to prevent a US-sponsored, pro-NATO coup in the rump state, which would be a replay of 2014 to 2022.
That needs careful management.

                            The Russians certainly crippled Georgia. Ukraine borders NATO, which will have easy access to rump Ukraine for stirring up trouble. That’s what needs managing.

            The Russians have also been very conservative.   Their loss ratio is about 8 to 1.  They carry on the war slowly but surely.   They also have kept the majority of their military units and combat capability in reserve in order to address any NATO moves.Regarding the West’s air superiority, last week the Russians warned France, Germany and Britain that if Russia is hit by any of the West’s advanced weaponry, they will consider that an attack by the countries that produced those weapons.  They also said they would attack the producers and supplies of these weapons in AND outside of Ukraine.I also suspect that if the West decided to use air power against the Russians it would not go as expected.  It is easy to bomb goat herders without air defense.  It would be an entirely different exercise to attack Russia.   Especially true since Russia can hit NATO where the aircraft are based.   Anywhere.

                Both sides know this.  There is a slow and small war because anything more ends in disaster for both sides.  The Russians have safe supply lines because we allow it.  (No airplanes for Ukraine, for example.)  Tge Russians can also hit the Uke’s supply lines – NATO countries.  It doesn’t because we don’t.
in any case, Russia really is not capable of pushing into Europe.  Not without going nuclear.
