        Jewish studio bosses are black listing Mel Gibson. I don’t doubt it is true, but it ain’t got anything to do with Jews or Jesus. Hollywood is instinctively conservative. By that I mean they don’t like wandering too far away from what they know works.
Wrong.  You should read Michael Medved’s book.  At least the part about how Hollywood continuously puts out garbage they know people won’t pay to see because it serves their political or “artistic” agenda.
