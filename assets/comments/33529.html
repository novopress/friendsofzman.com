        The attacks on Trump and Musk may go down as the turning point. The oligarchs took notice that no one was safe. Zuckerberg talking about the security agencies telling him what to do also would be noted.
What’s the point of being an oligarch if you’re subordinate to Deep State. But this attack on the Deep State is no joke. The oligarchs are doing the equivalent of burning the ships. They have to win. If they don’t, Deep State will come for them.

            That is the hope, that the oligarchs (well, the good ones anyway) will regain control and sanity to the GAE.I am alittlewary of private enterprises/individuals taking power away from government, though. This is a libertarian fantasy. If I have to choose sides, I choose Trump’s, but I don’t trust oligarchs either.

            There’s every reason to believe the oligarchs will win. Deep State itself is a result of oligarch indifference to governance. It’s bit like telling their underlings to go out and play and then years later being unhappy with the results.  It is interesting that it is happening now and apparently with quite a bit of oligarch support.

                “It is interesting that it is happening now and apparently with quite a bit of oligarch support.”The oligarch support of which you speak is only tactical and temporary. They are *not* our friends; they merely find it temporarily expedient to appear to be good guys. It would take weeks to explain this; therefore I refer you to Jim’s blog, where the subject is treated at length (now and then) and with great credibility. They use an odd kind of argot there,which takes getting used to, and a good knowledge of the 1789 French Revolution is necessary,but all of “us” should read Jim’s Blog as well as that of the Z Man.https://blog.reaction.la/

                    I never said they were our friends. I just am interested pleb who does not believe in “grass roots” revolutions when it comes to regime or social change.It precisely the bloodbath that was the French Revolution that Exhibit A regarding the issue of entirely overthrowing lawful authority. It doesn’t work and never has.

                A nice result of all this is that the Deep Staters are all repealing themselves by objecting. Sort of like the people in the demonstrations waving flags to tell you which country to send them back to.

                Thanks for that link. Jim is right. The no show jobs are the least of it. That slush fund is being used to dispossess those who paid for it. Will nukes fly when this reaches Harvard? I hadn’t really considered it, but maybe. Where will they be aimed? Alabama or Massachusetts? I don’t recall Jim previously discussing The Current Thing. Interesting.

            Some oligarchs realized that oligarching in a first world country is much more fun than doing it in a third world toilet. A few of them noticed that they were funding efforts to make the USA into a third world toilet and thought it better to stop.

        the interim head of the DOJ is going after people doxxing and threatening the DOGE people.  this is huge.   all the “scorpions” that know only one thing are going to end up in a “bottle” (in El Salvador).

                It’s important to distinguish between “U.S. citizens” and heritage Americans by birth.  It’s also important to distinguish by race.  Of course it will all be challenged, but I will give Trump et. al. full credit for creative thinking.  I laughed in delight when Iread about sending miscreants to El Salvador.  I remember when the Salvadorans first invaded D.C. in the ’80s – and I want them all sent home, along with their anchor children and grandchildren.  As far as ‘legal,’ I don’t give a damn.  We ceased being ‘in rule of law’ decades ago.

                    Salvadoreans are returning to El Salvador in droves thanks to Bukele’s “anto-democratic, anti-human rights” (i.e. anti-criminal) policies, which are making the country safe.

                                There’s easy and hard, and the former is preferable. It also is doable to a degree before resort to the latter, which also will be necessary if people get serious.

                            This is interesting. There are a large number of Americans who move to South America. Not all are retirees with fat pensions and 401Ks. In fact the movers are low savings pensioners and even young people. Why are they moving there? Because it is very hard to live here if you don’t make or have much.I imagine that as the US standard of living declines, especially if the gibs run out or buy less and less, that more will move back. Will be interesting to see.All net negatives should have the money taken away. I would give a lot to see think-tank and NGO ex-employees in line for jobs with the pets they wanted to replace us with.How sweet would that be?

                                I’m pretty sure that a lot of Americans would be safer and more prosperous living in certain cities and towns in Latin America than in overpriced shitholes like LA, Portland, or of course, Baltimore or Detroit. The weather will almost certainly be better. The problem for most of us is lack of language skills and the fact that Latin countries can be very inconsistent. Parts of a country will be fantastic and very pleasant, while a few miles away, the narco gangs are putting heads on posts like a real-life Apocalypse Now.

                        “human rights” is such a flexible term isn’t it? Depending on context, it can mean cutting off little boys’ penises, throwing feces in the holy water at the local church, or straight up infanticide. Being anti-human rights can also mean trying to prevent these things or even just trying to stop having your taxes used to fund them. Or is that last one more in the “anti-democratic” category?

                        That stuff (bat guano) is nasty.  The guy who built our property put up a bat house on the front of the garage. Our neighbor kindly moved it for us (to the side of the pole barn) where we don’t have to worry about stepping in it or breathing it while trying to shovel it away.  I’m glad bats eat bugs – but I still don’t want to deal with the bats.

                The Yankee Empire does not recognize what you rather quaintly refer to as “foreign nations.” That’s what “E pluribus unum” means: “We own everything everywhere.”
Well, except, of course, for the “homeland,” which obviously belongs to Paco, Running Deer, Muhammad, and Shaniqua. After all, they built the homeland, you know.

                Agreed. Be very careful what you wish for. I can see this happening and then say six years, or so from now if the left is in charge, Heritage Americans being rounded up and sent to prison in say Turkey (We might be able to say we were in a Turkish prison.) or, China for speaking out about the genocide of their own people.

                        Right. One of the refreshing things about events of late is people have realized legal niceties are rather quaint and have been for some time, so screw them. All the disgusting talk of “new rules” was naive as hell. The squawking over dismantling USAID is in part driven by the realization it is being done Because It Can Be Done.

                There are constitutional challenges to putting US citizens in foreign prisons, but it’s a good scare tactic. I’d rather we build a prison run like El Salvador’s in Alaska or Greenland.
However, I would bet that plenty of Salvadoran gang members in the USA are searching for ways to remove their tattoos, or looking for someplace to live that isn’t El Salvador or America.

            I’m trying not to get my hopes up about Bondi. I should know better. Hard to refrain in these times. Confirmation vote supposed to be tomorrow morning. If she hits the ground running as hard as the rest of the Trump admin has to date, then good lawd the fireworks. She’d be the stark exception if she doesn’t. Even Marco Rubio is surprising to the upside lately.

                    Sure. Like Trump himself. But that doesn’t seem to be slowing down the purge of the baizuo. I guess the “left’s” response to 10/7 pissed off the zionists more than anybody could have guessed.

        ” . .a lot of mortgage payments and ideological projects rely on that system.”ZMan is right about the contempt of the Cloud People for Dirt People. and the Blob is definitely Cloud People. A family member by marriage very recently retired from the State Department and moved over to one of the think tanks in Washington.. He’s high enough in the Blob that I am sure his kids, my grandnephew and grandniece, will  continue to have a roof over their head in Silver Spring. Trust me that they do not give a shit about their lesser relatives in flyover country. (They don’t give a shit about Russian or Ukrainian commoners, either.) No shits or f’s at all for whether common folks can afford a house in Kansas or Ohio, much less the Palisades or DC Metro, but plenty of hatred for the oppressors attacking their smug ass ecosystem– That’s how I really feel!

I’m not so sure. If the grift spigot is turned off, where will this money come from? If there’s any justice in this world, the whole lot of them will have to get real jobs.

            It was just a little suspicious when this relative unknown’s first book, about “responsibility to protect,” was not only an instant award winning bestseller endorsed and promoted by all the right people, but also used as a basis for public policy. Kind of like she didn’t really write it? Or maybe she did, but she was told what to write it about?

                She didn’t write a dam’ thing. All these right-thinking “best-sellers” are written as Leftist playbooks by people inside the Blob Z describes, and then are published, promoted and praised by the propaganda wing (media, academia, publishing houses) of the Power Structure. The Blob’s tentacles are manifold and incredibly long. Z’s article touches on one small, abeit extremely important part of that Blob.

                                Yes, I have. Archbishop Vigano has lately ex-communicated himself for being in open rebellion to the Pope. Every Protestant culture’s favorite “Catholic” is one that is in open rebellion against the visible head of the church. “Bergoglio” itself is an English speaking slur, used in way teens in rebellion call their father by their names.To be clear, a media that everyone believes is lieing when their lips are moving seems to be all in for believing it when it comes to the Pope. Pick one: a) The media lies about everything or b)the media is correct about Pope Francis. We don’t get both.

                                Because you’ve heard some bad thing about him through a Protestant/Jewish influenced media?? Everyone apparently is able to soul read Pope Francis because they saw a few headlines go by. God willing, I’ll be forgiven for assuming that maybe the Pope is Catholic and that the media lies about him.

                                        When he was elected many of his fellow Jesuits were concerned because he was known to be very conservative on the faith. There’s no magic soil in Argentina either. He fought communists.  Indeed, it’s been 10 years and nothing real has changed in the faith or the Catholic Church, except apparently the ability of people with internet connections to mind/soul read.

                        As a practicing Catholic, theoretically Catholicism should counter the Finkel effect in ideally a balanced way. In real world practice, there appears to be a version of Catholicism that is highly Finkel friendly. (See: Matt Walsh). There is also the version that is highly unFinkel friendly as seen in EM Jones.

Just because the owner hires management and staff doesn’t mean the owner is released of liability. This is war by another means.

                Oh come on, Ostei!  Whom one marries matters.  All her in-laws are chosen.  Her kids are half.  Most of their school friends and neighbors are.  I know you are not so naive as to think it doesn’t matter.  Of course there are traitorous Whites – but the lesson of Eve tempting Adam is a damned important one.

                    Bottom line, she’s no Jewess. She didn’t even convert upon marrying Sunstein. This also matters. She’s a race traitor. Her husband is a Finkel. The two are not the same.

                        Thankl you Ostei. I thank you every time you use last name Finkel. It is a last name of my favorite Russian speaking Rabbi Mihail Finkel.I learned from him (among other things) that all antisesemites come from monotheistic religions: Christianity and Islam. Both being derivatives of Judaism.There are no antisemites in Hindu India, none in Mongolia, Tibet and so on.It’s like teenagers rebelling against the parent.

                            That’s  hilarious, because modern Judaism is a derivative of Christianity, as is Islam. Both modern Judaism and Islam are newer than Christianity.And the Asians are generally far more willing to call a spade a spade precisely because they have not yet been shaped by Christianity.

                                I know the Masters want to blame Nestorian Orthodox, but Islam’s roots originated with a Judaic sect in 159 BC; they rebelled against the High Priest when he had their leader murdered in a very public and graphic way.
Later on, they accepted Jesus as a prophet, and went on from there, eventually to forcibly convert other Arab tribes away from Jesus as a Roman divinity.
Mohammed’s first wife converted him, he’s more a St. Paul figure who found Allah instead.

                                    Islam is a twist of Christianity as you suggest at the very end with St. Paul. The Quran talks about Jesus and Miriam (Mary) a great deal. It gets it’s militancy and insistence on universal brotherhood from Christianity. Simply having Jesus there at all suggests it’s a Christian heresy (most Muslims have many theories on Jesus). By timelines both modern Judaism and Islam appear after 33AD. Both also represent specific rejections of Christian dogma. The similarities between modern Judaism and Islam can be explained by similar rejections of Jesus as God while attempting to base belief in the OT Scriptures.

            One of the biggest hurdles for me in getting to this side of The Great Divide was coming to understand the enormity and viciousness of the Blob. Back then, it was taking great pains to fly under the radar and use stealth tactics.The give-away for me was stumbling across this blog and learning how to actually do effective fact checks. I do the face/palm thing even now about my naivety. This is a huge tell when trying to suss out the blob and its creatures. When I see super-people…the guys that made all the right career moves, that supposedly were instrumental in great deeds and undertakings, that could do no wrong as they climbed the ladder of success getting accolades and credentials that take normal people ages to get… THAT is the give away, nine times out of ten. Pete Buttigeig’s resume reads like that of a hero from paperback thriller novels. He was a whiz kid supposedly in the intelligence racket and his credentials as an American hero look stunning… on paper. It’s all bullshit of course, when you see them rocket up through through the ranks, with all kinds of achievements that just don’t happen to mediocrities like them. As an aside… that recent Whitehawk helicopter accident sounds like it just may have been the end of one such animal. A lesbian activit/DEI flunky was on her way up to glory and prominence but was taken out by an aviation ‘accident’.A Busy Weekend and the ‘Mystery Pilot’ of the Crashhawk – Big Country ExpatI see Trump’s team – with the possible exception of Elon – are largely real people, with real experience and real connections. None of them can be bought because they have their own money, they are serious men of worth that can look after themselves and stand alone if necessary. Most are real patriots too, and although they are tainted by politics as all leaders are… they are at least dissident-adjacent. They aren’t perfect choir boys, they can and do play dirty… but for the most part their motivations are sincere.Whadda they call it? A preference cascade? I think that is what we may be seeing now. Joe Biden may have been the final nail in the Blob coffin. Americans everywhere are seeing the Blob whereas before – anyone that mentioned it was a conspiracy nut.Blumpf and Co. are just the start of what must come. We need to keep the heat on him, and keep the ball rolling. And as for getting rid of the ticks and lower order parasites – their resumes will largely give them away.

            “The Father-Son folks vs. the Mother-Goddess coalition”That’s really the essence of what this is. A lot of the outrage the USAID initiative has been generating is the shrieking of millions of upper middle class wammen with no real skills realizing, in most cases rather suddenly, that their whole lifestyle has been underwritten by USAID and other NGO tentacles of the blob. As Zman puts it “Most of them had no idea that their paycheck was coming from the government” and “a lot of mortgage payments … rely on that system”.This is something I noticed long ago about this type of woman, particularly the young ones. Women struggle with self-awareness. They may live in their parents’ 6 bedroom mansion in NoVA and get to drive daddy’s “old” Mercedes convertible to their shopping sprees in Georgetown but they will tell you that they are just middle class. They think they’re showered with male attention because they’re just that wonderful. This carries over into the ridiculous careers they pick. They seriously believe all that stuff about how “the arc of history bends towards justice (and their Prada handbag)”. You see this also when they talk about “manifesting” things, basically imagining things into existence. It drives their view that because they can imagine “a world without inequality” that such a thing is possible. Of course John Lennon wrote that stupid song about this too so dimwit xirlthink has pervaded pop culture forever too.To me, it’s delightful to think that Trump and Musk have harpooned the money balloon that kept their whole world floating along. It’s also impossible to overstate the calming effect on world politics this will have. All over Europe, the Middle East, and probably even Africa, trouble-making “alternative” radio stations will go silent, rent-a-mobs will be forced to go back to panhandling and ripping off tourists, and color revolutions will be cancelled.We can also hope that maybe a few of the more thoughtful and honest young women will cancel their plans to ride the gravy train and the global cock carousel and find husbands and make some White babies.Trump certainly continues to surprise in good ways.

                Nailed it bro. Massively underrated comment. I posted earlier this week that being very adjacent to the Swamp I know 4 of these super lefty whamen personally and dozens adjacently.
The existential dread they are having is lulzy beyond my wildest dreams. Imagine floating along through life feet never touching the earth in your ruby slippers and the here comes Orange Hitler to give you a pair of dusty old shoes and planting your ass squarely on terra firma. It’s glorious and LONG overdue.

            I always thought that “R2P” shit she was pushing 20 years ago was just plain trite and stupid. I was reading guys like Mearsheimer in grad school in the 1990s, and a few years later along comes Power with this nonsense, and I was like “WTF is this crap?” I couldn’t understand how anyone could possibly take it seriously.

            The other kid (Luke Farritor – the one who used AI to transcribe that Greek scroll) is a recent graduate of The University of Nebraska – Lincoln .  UNL is my alma mater so I have no problem saying it’s just a run-of-the-mill state university, not even a particularly high ranking one like Illinois or Michigan.  I don’t know his full story, but it seems likely he was boxed out from the elite institutions because he’s a White male.  This is such a good example to demonstrate the type of exceptional human capital that’s sitting idle in the heartland of this country.  These are the men that led technological progress in post-WWII America (Bell Labs, Skunk Works, NASA, ect).  I’m glad Elon is giving kids like him a chance and I hope it’s a harbinger for things to come.

        Samantha Power is Inner Party through and through. If Trump+Musk succeed — and I pray they do — they will have dismembered a key instrument of the power of Oceania. USAID — Orwell couldn’t have named it better — is a key instrument of imperial control internationally and domestically. Normie thinks “all those furriners are gettin’ all that free money.”

That’s what I noticed about communists, our modern secular version of religious conquest.  They try to absorb all of the nation, all of the culture and turn it towards perpetuation of, and power for, their cult.They really are the Blob.

                This seems like more evidence that the regime just doesn’t get why people don’t like them. They said all this stuff for 10 years! Kamala’s final pitch to voters was that voting for OMB was a vote for plutocracy/oligarchy. Her final pitch was that her and Liz Cheney were pure democracy. Nobody wants to hear it anymore. Nobody cares. People want, to use an old term, the swamp to be drained. Elon is out there on X telling everyone what the swamp really is and what they are doing to drain it. This is what people voted for. Nobody is crying for the fed workers who now have to go into the office more than once a week. Nobody is crying for the millions of left-wing activists around the world who turn out to be getting paid with taxpayer money (makes it seem like Soros was always a distraction from the real grift). We just want it stopped. If the guy who does it is a plutocrat to the left, so be it. Those words don’t mean anything anymore.

                    apologies, but “taxpayer money” is another normie take on this system of debt issued to create the illusion ‘money’- they could take it all – all of everything out here- and it would not pay the interest on the debt they have created with the derivatives of the derivations on this monstrous financial pyramid ‘thing’ which will soon collapse upon all our heads. and trump gets the blame. as planned.

                    Well said and all that, but I don’t think *most* people are concerned about the Swamp or with good government or anything like that. What *most* people are concerned with is the prices at the grocery store and whether they can afford a ton of junk food for their friends when they host a Super Bowl party so that everybody can spend entire weekends in front of the boob tube watching some Negroes play with a ball.

            Powers is an execrable person married to an even worse one: Cass Sustein. Together, they have destroyed lives throughout Europe and North America. If you follow the migration madness in Ireland, take note that she was one of the Dublin Cloud-adjacent folks who orchestrated the dispossession of their own people. Her grotesque visage betrays the evil that dwells within her. I truly hope she dies in prison.

        One wonders how many Republicans have been recipients of USAID money. I’ve heard things about the Sodomite of South Carolina. Who is all of a sudden backing Gabbard, RFKJ, and Patel, all three. Funny. While the purist in me would prefer “justice,” if this is how Trump has to get his nominees through, so be it. Which underscores the games within the games that have to be going on here.
You can’t discount the possibility of violence when this many rice bowls are getting smashed.

            ” this many rice bowls are getting smashed.”Exactly.. It’s like all the manufacturing plants in a small town or city being shut down and their production moved overseas, but this time its happening to them and done by contemptible lesser people. “This is not supposed to happen to US!”I really want the whole thing to collapse to the point where they will be happy to have a job digging a canal by hand for the new Civilian Conservation Corps and no one with a BA or higher can be a supervisor or work inside. Let them line up at the food bank after their shift and the off the clock hour long un-airconditioned bus commute home. It will be the best education they ever got.

                    “Turdburglar” is the Americanism. Straight to the point.
I don’t know if homos are more criminal than other men (sex crimes aside), but I know they can’t resist bragging about it. Child porn makers (almost all gay) get caughtsharingit, most of O’Keefe’s “stings” are fags being smug on dates, etc.
This, not the threat of blackmail, is why they were banned from secret work. They so want to be scandalous and gossiped about, they do it themselves.

John Kerry probably best exemplifies this specimen of welfare gadfly, plus his posse of girl boss toadies like Samantha and their “R2P” gig.Obama further widened this ecosystem by requiring they open their ranks to a DIE strata that his initiatives and made permanent through law. Now all such state-level organizations reflect these changes. (Think of it as targeted reparations.)As it turns out, this “elite” welfare recipients plus the regular welfare recipients plus government employees plus those who depend on the government indirectly for a living (universities, tax accountants and lawyers) pretty much equals the democrat party. And the entire group fully supports the bureaucratic managerial class’s luxury belief system down to its every last absurdity.Everyone else falls into the opposing category of those not dependant on the govt, who prefer to be left alone.Major conflict!

            Anon, excellent points. Trump/Musk attacking the Blob where it hurts the most (their income stream) is a stroke of genius on many points, not the least of which is that the Dirt People know enough of the corrupt system to loathe them and have little if any sympathy. Yes, it’s inevitable that some ”good” nonprofits are going to take a hit, but Joe Average isn’t going to shed a tear that the local Tranny Readings to Children at the local public library has been curtailed due to budget cuts. It’s a fair generalization that substantially the entire Federal “work” force is hard-left Democrat and likely doubly so for the [former?] recipients of USAID and similar funding. (No questions, please, about why Israel and Egypt funding is off the table.)I wish our Blob fighters great success.

It’s long past time to do some zero-based budgeting on the entire system and make each of these nonprofits justify their claim on government support — which should be subject to periodic review and auditing by DOGE or something like it.

            Exactly so. This is a slush fund. And much of the transport and feeding of aliens brought to these shores to rape and murder our children is done by cut-outs paid from it. Even election fortification flows from the slush fund via NGO’s to “promote democracy.” This is the beating financial heart of the corruption and evil that emanates from D.C. Soros and Co. always get a return on their investments, political or otherwise, and when this spigot gets cut off they close their wallets.As I replied below to Z, this has been known a long time. Between Trump’s election the first time and his inauguration, he announced the State budget and personnel would be slashed. They knew what was going on. So did Mitch McConnell, who announced there would be no such cuts. That bastard in particular is among the most corrupt to ever hold federal office.

                    I have a notion that he is on team Trump by extension. I could be wrong, but Betsy DeVos and Mitch’s wife stomped out of there in unison on January 6th. Betsy’s work is going to end up with the Department of Education getting shut down, hopefully. I’m hoping the McConnells are also doing the right thing, by extension.
I know somebody who knows Mitch casually. He says Mitch is a stuffed shirt, but he’s not a bad guy.
Let’s see what happens.

        This is called “going for the jugular” and it proves Trump is serious about draining the swamp. Audit equals exposure equals outrage, and sunlight on the Ukraine money laundering pipeline will also explode onto the public stage soon. DoJ needs to step in and make examples of a few of these players or vigilantism will emerge in its place. And if the pedophile epidemic gets revealed, it’s Katy bar the door time. This could be the year when the gloves come off.

        To this point, there has been no oversight of USAID. It has been free, for example, to give money to George Soros organizations that do things like back candidates for state prosecutor in the United States.Wait until Americans learn they have paid for their own dispossession and for their children to be raped and murdered by Pakis and Haitians and others brought to their shores by USAID cutouts. Thus far, the Trump team has let the threatened leftist shrieks and howls go unanswered, but there likely will be an accounting of the full scale of evil USAID has funded once mouths have run and those involved cannot deny responsibility.

        Constance Berry Newman wins the Lifetime Physiognomy Award.My God!!The system is hopelessly corrupt. I am rooting for Trump and his team to succeed. I pray for their lives and that of their families. This is crossing the Rubicon. Every person who is doing this cannot go back. Neither can America. The war between the elites has come to a boil. Like the campus Palestine protesters, the small fries in this network are going to learn some hard lessons.Is there some point of negotiation or means of de-escalation? I suspect Butler was The Regime crossing the Rubicon and the rising counter-elite, understanding we are in the acceleration of the looting phase, were forced to take a side and make a move.The Regime can file lawsuit after lawsuit and tie this up in courts and wait out the seige. Then the resolve and commitment of Trump and the oligarchs will be tested. I have mentioned before that Thiel has openly said that this time they can let the blue metros go insolvent without bailout.For my money, the NGO fund freeze is a good step for all I care about. I think at some point taxing remittances is going to be necessary. You want to bring those countries to their knees? That will do it. You want mass deportations? That will do it. Of course, that would also mean international finance will be faced with loans to, “sovereigns”, that are going into foreclosure. An empire this corrupt with this many threads to pull at is going to be a hell of a thing to unravel. The elites are going to be at each other’s throats.Dig in and stay safe. May ICE move from sanctuary cities to massive rendition flights from all of the small town America cities that have been mass re-settled. May Mayorkas, …. …

        Norm eisen says he is working with judges on a counter attack. They will win at the state level like they just did with Washington state. Trump will be bogged down with lawfare.As Z notes, Trump is out for revenge so this time he and his team seem ready to fight back. After all, if Trump doesn’t win his fight with the blob and Vance doesn’t become president in 2028, Trump must surely understand he will spend his final years fighting court cases then ultimately going to jail. Should be very interesting.I think the RFK Jr confirmation will be the tell about how hard Trump will work the system for his benefit. If RFK does not get confirmed in spite of his massive popularity it will be a sign Trump will only go so far in getting his way and Republicans will be free to undermine him like in his first term.

                karl:  That’s the big win – having all the databases and emails and locking it all down while they comb through it.  The leftists will not take this lying down – but now Trump and Musk have documented evidence on all of them, and all their taxpayer-funded millions.  Up til now I’ve thought those predicting more assassination attempts were exaggerating – but I would bet quite a few of those whose ox is being gored would pay quite a bit to get rid of Trump, Musk, and all the young guys going through the records.

            State judges don’t have jurisdiction to do anything about the running of the Federal government…They’ll be arrested if they try…USAID was created by E.O. so it can certainly be destroyed by same, and the Supremes won’t have a problem with that…Trump says he’ll go to war over Tulsi and RFK, and he can recess appoint them if Mike Johnson cooperates, which he will….All hell is likely to break out in 2028, but Trump is winning right now…..

Doubtful. Even NYT is recognizing that Trump’s strategy is “flood the zone”. There are not enough corrupt lawyers and judges in the world to keep up with LLMs churning out EOs.

        Most of them had no idea that their paycheck was coming from the government.I’m kind of surprised this isn’t more well-known. My rural Appalachian county is stuffed to the gills with what I call “grant farmers.” Main street in the county seat is wall-to-wall NGOs that get all their funding from government sources and there are all sorts of “Appalachian development” scams where somebody throws up a sign in an old store front and calls it “an art collective for disabled and marginalized Appalachian residents” and spends the next several years living off the grant money as long as they can get the occasional kid in a wheelchair to draw a picture for them to show off.I’ve often felt like “our thing” is at such a severe disadvantage because the leftist grant farming ecosystem is so large, organized and widespread.I’m on a couple mailing lists so I get notices for Zoom calls for meetings about all sorts of useless leftist stuff the government is giving them money for.Check outhttps://reimagineappalachia.org/It’s like a clearing house for this stuff.Edit: Heh. You can’t make this stuff up. One of their upcoming events is “Funding for Healthy Community Forests:A Grant of the Month Club Event.”Really saying the quiet part out loud, there.

            I’ve been saying that about 1/3 of AINO’s economy is fake. I’m sticking with that guesstimate. But I could have underestimated how much of that 1/3 was funded in this manner. People paid with made up money to do nothing of any value. It begs the question of why they are required to do anything at all in exchange for it. I guess appearances must be kept up, since if they were openly paid for doing nothing, it would call into question why anyone should work at all. That’s probably the fundamental flaw in UBI.

I’d say that’s a very conservative estimate. Like someone pointed out several days ago, America’s economy is largely everyone washing someone else’s laundry. I don’t know that it would quite hit 2/3, but it’s got to be 50%.

        USAID’s job was regime change and appointing puppet satraps.  It’s origins came from 1948 Congressional action that determined the way forward was to place governments supportive of US-based “Democracy”; the first election we rigged was the first democratic regime in Italy following Mussolini’s end.
The stated reason was to prevent Communism from gaining control.  This, after we had just fought a world war against nationalists, who had risen to power to keep Communists from gaining control.

Next: Trump and Luttnick are planning our first sovereign wealth fund, ever.Luttnick has bragged openly about how he wants to skim 1% of our national natural asset base, valued at $500 trillion.
It’s that base they’re trying to consolidate into “natural asset companies” traded on a “carbon-based exchange” that is the driver behind conversion to digital currency.Like Blackrock, they need control only 5% of each piece to control all the pieces.The stability of Rollerball’s “Seven Corporations run the world.”

            Absolutely correct. However–although I retroactively oppose it–one could sort of understand why America meddled so much during the Cold War. After all, there really was a concentrated enemy out there that posed something of a threat to America. Now, with the Blackberry Fruitcake Empire’s hegemony secured and no genuine enemy on the horizon, there can be no justification whatsoever for its geopolitical subterfuge and subversion. The BFE’s leaders are greedy, anti-white, imperialistic zealots. Nothing more, nothing less.

                Yes. Well, “The Road to Hell is paved with good intentions” as my pappy used to say.
Besides, the Cold War was a conflict with ouralliesfrom 1941-45, and five years later we were threatening each other with nuclear Armageddon, so what does that tell you? Once we abandoned the Monroe Doctrine and became a global imperial power, we became just as corrupt as every other empire, andraison d’etatreplaced republican nationalism and constitutionalism.

                    What that tells me is that our WWII alliance with the USSR was an alliance of convenience, which could conveniently be dispensed with once the Nazis were vanquished. It’s not as if the US and USSR were boon companions, 1941-45.
As for the postwar empire, I did state my opposition to imperialism. My point was simply that there were two global empires after WWII and it’s understandable why the US was such a globalquidnuncin attempting to defeat the opposing empire.

                        Yes, this is why all the “systems” theorists in international relations theory held that structure was more important than ideology. Once you become an empire it’s all an “alliance of convenience,” it’s all Machiavellianism.
That’s my point. All the talk about promoting “democracy” has been bullshit from the very beginning.

                            Sure, it was mostly realpolitik. However, there must be distinguishing features between competing empires. There must be an us/them dichotomy. In the Cold War it was so-called “liberal democracy” versus global communism. And, in point of fact, there really was a rather stark difference between life in Semipalatinsk and St. Looie in 1962.

            It’s impossible to overstate how significant Trump’s attack on USAID and by implication, the whole rats’ nest of NGOs is. These organizations form the bureaucratic wing of a global shadow government. The “enforcement” wing of that government is the vast array of intelligence agencies ranging from the FBI/CIA to MI5/6 (those agencies have exactly parallel roles in the US and UK). The old mid 20th century one worlders** actuallydidget their wish even though it never quite consolidated its global stranglehold or got strong enough to declare its presence openly. Now, thankfully, it’s chief host states, the US and UK, are terminally ill and their global shadow state is dying with them.This was Putin’s cardinal sin. Not only did he recognize what these people were and shut them down, he encouraged other states to do the same. Now you’ve got BRICS and others thumbing their noses as the “rules based order” purveyed by London and DC and people making serious moves away from the dollar.**One worlders: Einstein was among them and wrote essays about world government and socialism showing just how dumb he was when he wasn’t doing physics.

        Here is a very odd event in the USAID budget-
In 2019, the final full year of Trump 45, the USAID budget exploded from about $15 billion to $42 billion.
Who planned that? Who signed off on that? Where did all that additional money go?
Elon and DOGE need to be all over this period of time in the USAID budget.

            The most obvious guess is it paid for the plandemic and color revolution that happened a year later. Paying those activists, funnelling money to prosecutors, instituting a worldwide censorship grid, making sure every global health agency said the same thing, fortifying the election, all that stuff wasn’t cheap. Heck, now I am wondering if it was REALLY Zuckerberg’s money that he put up for fortifications, or did he merely launder it…

        The USAID audit will be a gold mine of blackmail material. When it comes to how FedGov operates, there’s no better way to change hearts &amp; minds.Therefore, I predict none of us proles will see more than a token result. They’ll be too useful to fritter away on criminal justice prosecutions.
I recall Hillary Clinton doing the same thing during her husband’s first Presidency, when she got hold of FBI secret files on government officials.

            USAID is now controlled by State. The CIA has its own network and there is plenty of overlap, but USAID has been a rogue shop for about thirty years now. Frankly, the CIA has not been good at this for a long time, which is why the usual suspects prefer to run out of places like USAID.

                Yes. Also a reminder: when Trump was elected the first time, he announced before his inauguration that State’s budget would be slashed. His team knew. McConnell immediately said there would be no State cuts. He knew.It may seem a non-sequitur, but it is not: there was little election fortification this time because it was not as lavishly funded by the Tech Bros. Now imagine the USAID spigot gets cut off to fortify. Several GOP senators (Ernst, so forth) got the same honey, largely to assure they won their primaries. Wonder why Ernst was so down with tranny soldiers and initially opposed Hegseth? There’s your answer.

Imagine that you’re in Chicago on vacation. Now imagine walking through the east-west mainhallwayof the City Hall-County Building in Chicago. The architecture, artwork, and detail are really impressive, are they not?
Ok, now imagine seeing more than a dozen of Marcus Garvey’s “Pan-African” niggernaziflagson poles mounted on the walls. Supposedly it’s due to “Black History Month”, so named to honorbrownskinned semisavages who understand not their confession that they comprise a very bad breed of primate.

        The blob will undoubtedly fight back, but a lot of s*** is getting into the light for the first time, and a lot of the pushback is absolutely showing how these turds want it kept in the dark.  More and more will easily see how utterly corrupt the US government is.  Trumpzilla is thundering up Pennsylvania Avenue coming for those bitchez…

            Elon is cleaning up the balance sheet and getting rid of surplus fedgov staff so that his Mars colonization project can go ahead with fewer impediments. The ZIC is preparing stupid white guys and the “federal” government for a new war requiring military conscription and vast quantiites of resources.

No need for conscription.
The military is reporting its best December and January recruiting numbers in 15 years.
Also note that the trip wire for war with Iran was announced yesterday.
Totally agree that Elon’s real motive is freeing up funding for his Mars boondoggle. He probably also believes that project will make him the first trillionaire.

        Nice to see budgets getting snatched from some bad guys (by other bad guys), if it sticks. Whatever hurts them is good. But even if DOGE et al. aren’t dramatically thwarted, remember that libertarians are always wrong. “Defunding” leaves two very great problems (or one very, very great one):All the people who get fired, demoted, etc., are stillthemselves.They cannot be made useful or decent. “What are they gonna do?” Some evil shit. Whatever they’re told. Nothing good. “So we’llincentivize—” Shut up, nerd.This is why mass murder is a political tradition. “We have forgotten the problem.”They have not.Listen and believe.Second, an Iron Law:The nearer a conspiracy theory comes to the truth, the nearer it comes to “Nothing is real”—which isn’t true.Everyoneisa fed…almost. Everythingisfake and gay…almost.This knowledge, the more you know it, the less realitbecomes. And your lost not-knowing becomescomfort. Almost everyone retreats to it. Nobody’s a fed! Not anymore! We fixed that!We complain that people don’t remember the horrors of last week’s news, that knowledge of our being wronged doesn’t stick or make anything happen, that every criminal is a “repeat offender” but we pretend there are no usual suspects, etc.So,remember. Rememberwho.Forgiveness is a death wish. Forgetfulness makes it come true.

        Btw, another interesting move related to the Trump team. A senator has introduced a bill to provide regulations for stablecoins. The bill is expected to pass and pave the way for much larger use of stablecoins around the world. (Trump is a fan of them.)
Stablecoins are backed by t-bills. This could provide a huge new source of t-bill buyers, which, of course, helps keep rates low and the dollar strong.

            Hummm.  Ignorant analysis here, but I can’t help thinking of prior experience of countries having inflated their currency out of all reality—think Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe—then come out with a replacement currency to restart the process.  Same crap, different name.  Hell, I still have postage stamps in my collection where they simply ran them back through the presses and added three zeros, or even an “M” to the postage price.

            The bitcoin market cap is what, about 2 trillion? I’d be surprised if the combined market cap of every other cryptocurrency in the world added up to 1 trillion. So let’s say 3 trillion then. So that’s a potential market of 3 new trillions for T bills? At the very most? Fedgov burns through that in a year. What am I missing? These prospective new T bill buyers, presumably they would have to quit buying something else in order to buy T bills instead.

            Exactly this. Stablecoin funds will do more to maintain the dollar as a global reserve currency than all the foreign wars we have funded in the past few decades. I’ve been astounded that the Treasury Department has not pushed the pedal to the metal on stablecoin adoption.

            I believe Vance knows what he signed up for.  This scorched earth policy only ends with one victor; there will be no compromises.
They don’t fear “the left” or Democrats; those entities are geriatrics who’ve been unchallenged so long they don’t know what to do when the fundamental order of DC is being challenged.
The ones to watch are Republicans.  They love being controlled opposition, not visionaries.

                I agree. We’re seeing the caterwauling from the usual suspects and the legacy media. In 2012 this would have all been ignored, but the last 3 elections have shown that fewer people pay attention to the regime’s nonsense. The worst that can happen is the legacy media ignores it and the cucked politicians equivocate. But the cat’s out of the bag, and the righteous energy is on Trump’s side.

            Trump had all those enemies already, when he did nothing. He might as well do something. Unlike in 2016, though, he has rich and powerful friends, and they are more competent than his enemies.
I think Vance is on board with this agenda. He wants to be President, and I don’t see how he is even on this team if he wasn’t willing to go all the way. See how the blob treated Cuck Pence on his way out the door even if that loser bent the knee on his way out.

                    Pence is the avatar of cuckservatism. Look at how he handled the “religious freedom act” while governor of Indiana. Not only did he cave after a small amount of pressure and threats to call him racist and other names, he actually restricted religious freedom after the outcry. His life is one worthy of only contempt, which pretty well reflects the Republican Party.eta: Forgot my main reason for response. Pence’s protege is Sen. Jim Banks. Musk met with him the other day and gave him a glimpse of Christmas Future. Banks is now fine with Trump’s cabinet nominations. Apparently Joni Ernst along with Lindsey Graham also got a little preview of what was upcoming. Banks wanted to continue the Pence Tradition but, naaah.

Trump had all those enemies before because they feared what he has now become. His enemies list has  grown and become manifold. That Butler dude wasn’t very competent either, but he almost succeeded.

                    One thing I’ve gleaned from this group is that there is no “going back”.  As I’ve confessed before, it is a trap that I fall into often.  The past is all I know, and therefore my “go to” in many arguments, but it really ain’t coming back.  And in final analysis, should we bring it back?  After all, how did we get here except from the past.  No sense recreating a situation that failed us the first time we tried it.

                    The American Republic was ended in Lincoln’s war. Finally unchained from the design of 1789 all that happened next was not unfortuante, it was inevitable. Trump, and, with great good fortune President Vance, will provide a welcome pause, but nothing more. As Jimmy Madison observed–                                                                                                I am unable to conceive that the people of America, in their present temper, or under any circumstances which can speedily happen, will choose, and every second year repeat the choice of …men who would be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or treachery….who would either desire or dare…. to betray the solemn trust committed to them.What change of circumstances time, and a fuller population of our country may produce requires a prophetic spirit to declare, which makes no part of my pretensions.

        Back when Trump first won people asked why the opposition had fallen silent as a grave. I had a lengthy list of reasons, but on that list was the lack of foot soldiers. A lot of young people voted for Trump. And a lot more realized they had been flat out lied to.To this now add the fact that among those remaining THERE IS NO MONEY to pay them.A counterattack is unlikely because those USAID payment records will be used like the Epstein files. Those leaks about Bill Kristol and Lindsey Graham this week weren’t about optics. Those were WARNING shots. Same with the slam of Catholic Charities last week after the USCCB complained about deportations.It might also help get some of the Federal judges in line, too. Many of them have kids to suck on that USAID nipple.Trump is also swamping them with lawsuits while simultaneously killing their funding streams to pay for the lawyers.

        What’d be fascinating is if Musk and team release unredacted* records, dating back to its inception, of what was paid and to whom.This is added to the same wish list hoping for as-complete-as-possible disclosures on the JFK, RFK, MLK files, etc. Etc. As long as I’m making a list for Santa, I would see full reports on what dirt those pardoned by Biden were at risk of being charged with. If they can’t be charged, what harm in informing the public?*It’s no secret — or at least a reasonable supposition — that certain of the monies distributed were for intelligence or other covert purposes, therefore will be hush-hush due to that old rubber stamp “National Security”. Just the same, I don’t see why a full accounting couldn’t be provided.

        I imagine that there has not been much daylight between the main players who have set the priorities at USAID, on the one hand, and on the other hand the managers of the should-be-foreign-facing CIA and military intelligence color revolution agents who coordinated the Vindman impeachment circus,organized the George Floyd insurrection,set up the January 6th entrapment riot, and were the handlers of the Trump assassins.  So, makes sense that 2025 Trump is done playing around with these folks.

        Mike Benz has pointed out that the NED and USAID are basically CIA fronts. Spreading democracy and helping poor people sounds a lot better than the actual CIA skullduggery (e.g., color revolutions).

            It has often been true that the CIA is involved, but I think Benz is wrong about the relationship. USAID and NED have more control over the CIA that the CIA has control over them.

        A suggestion..we should never imprison US citizens in a foreign country. We have glorious US territory and posessions that can be used. Check out Johnson Atoll many of the Alutian Islands or even Midway Island…a great place to transfer large numbers of government workers who can’t be fired. Also a great place for prisons.
