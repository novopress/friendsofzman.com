        The recent elections in Europe where unapproved ideas and voters are marginalized thru “democracy” show that the approved democracy is failing. And thus democracy in the west is digging its own grave

            In France, Le pens’ party got 10 million votes. The left center 7, and the communists 6. Their rigged system awarded the nationalists 1/3 of the seats in parliament, but it’s the leftys rioting.How do we spell wildfire again?

                Absolutely unsustainable. The French elites have been can-kicking for decades, and eventually they will end up like the aristocrats in Z-man’s linked pic.

                They don’t riot when they lose. They don’t lose.
Protest is a dominance display or a celebration (via entreaty, sometimes) of the regime. That’s why MAGA/trucker/pro-life/etc. protests arede factoillegal throughout the West and why “the left” can do whatever it wants—with one exception.

        I think the order came from on high, and this was coordinated,  to go ahead and say that he was not fit to run and that’s why they had this really early debate, so that they could dislodge him and his family. I am greatly enjoying that it is not going to plan.I mean how fantastic, someone said he blackmailed Barack Obama saying he’d release information about his homosexual lifestyle? Or his wife did I guess.  Incredible that headlines like that are even appearing. Though that seems pretty tame, more likely it’s about Big Mike. I am struck by the modern era being bookended by women ruling in place of their demented husbands.But now I think the media is probably enjoying fulfilling their mythological role of talking truth to power and they’re not going to give it up.And yes, it only ends one way. I think it is Severian that said ‘The Cure is the Collapse’. It’s pithy. We need t-shirts.

            Biden kerfuffle is a limited hangout. Get normies used to one bit of the deception, count on the short attention spans and quick news cycles to pave the way for the next False Flag or State Funeral.
Once the attention is on the new shiny object, Biden issues will fade until convention time. By then there will be more BS, and more overt threats, to reshape the narrative.

                “new shiny object”.  The problem for them is Biden will keep providing increasingly bizarre examples of his surly decrepitude.  It’s not like he is going to get better. They can’t get this nasty bumbling bombastic old fool off the stage!

            Z used it as an example of their 1 dimensional thinking.
A better plan would have been to put him out their in a primary debate and let him get obliterated by Dems last Fall, then pull the plug on him through the normal process.
RFK might have shown up and done the demolition, which would have created new problems.

                The problem with that is that his replacement’s honeymoon period would have ended long before the election and they would start to look mortal. This way, forcing him out less than 3 months before the general election (presumably at the convention late August), his replacement has a big messiah moment and a honeymoon that rides right into election day. Re: that messiah moment, it will be just as sudden a “preference cascade” or whatever you call it as this debate thing was. All of a sudden, in an instant, the entire MSM and lefty social media will swoon for the new candidate. Gush. Weep. Sing hosannas. It’s gonna be Michelle.

                    I think this is another problem for them – what honeymoon period? Kamala won’t get one because she is horrible and nobody likes her. Gavin Newsom won’t get one because he is White. Big Mike is probably the only one who the party can broadly get behind, but I’m not convinced that is going to happen.I also wonder, theoretically, and conceptually, if the party even can unify, at least in the short term. We have a political process to resolve differences, but the Dems shut it down the past three elections through various shenanigans. Feels like a lot of the frustrations are bubbling up now and once things split into various factions, it’s hard to put it all back together in a couple months.

                        I’m not quite actually 100% on Big Mike. I’m sure Hillary wants it. And she’s been radio silent since The Debate, whereas she was all over the news for about a month prior. That’s suspicious. But H cannot unite the clans the way M can. M is the only one the whole D base/apparatus would get excited about. Well, maybe Oprah, but I don’t think it’s her.

                        I really don’t understand the right-wing meme that Michelle Obama will be the Democrat presidential candidate. It was well-known that she (OK, he/it/whatever) disliked the Washington fishbowl intensely. She has no real people-connecting skills, is not a good orator, has never held any office, (or any real job that was not a DEI grift), and has no real constituency within the Democratic Party, Congress, the media or the voters.I just don’t see it.Perhaps the meme comes from the idea the Barack is really the one pulling the strings in the Biden administration and Michelle would give him a de facto third term, sort of the way George Wallace ran his wife Lurleen for governor when he was term-limited out.But even Barack himself was just a front man, I don’t think he is actually calling the shots. He’s not a party man, he’s a grifter. He’s fundamentally a lazy bastard and he’s more interested in spending his time at his homes in Hawaii and Martha’s Vineyard after cashing in on his racial grievance grift.

                            Xman, the Dems are running a cadaver for reelection. Is Big Mike any less likely or a worse candidate? The bottom line is she’s a big-name negress whose views are to the Left of Trotsky, and that’s good enough. The only thing that would disqualify her is if she simply doesn’t want the job, which is of course possible.

                                Yes, I think that’s it. I don’t think she wants it.True, the Democrats are now stuck with a cadaver, but that wasn’t the plan. They ran him in 2020 and they put him on the Obama ticket for a reason: he brings in the old white Boomer Democrats and he’s been inside Washington for fifty years. He had a constituency, he had a name, he had media recognition, he had legislative experience.Remember they ran him as a “sober, levelheaded, stable, dignified” candidate against the shoot-from-the-lip firebrand Trump.Now, I personally don’t buy any of that bullshit, I think the guy’s been a doofus and a bullshitter and a creep for fifty years.But I know white people who will walk over hot coals to vote for him in November.I don’t see Michelle as having even the same vote-drawing appeal as Biden, even though she checks the Magic Negress box.Let’s not forget that a lot of that diversity stuff is bullshit to be used against the white rubes, and some of the white lefties know it. You think Gavin Newsom and Hillary aren’t beside themselves with envy and rage that the colored pawns are usurping their shot at power? Hillary was outraged when the colored man Obama “stole” her presidency in 2008. She had a hell of time biting her tongue for eight years… and then when Trump “stole” it from her in 2016, she was about ready to jump off a bridge.

                                    The fan base Biden has in the older demographic is fascinating. I can only assume that it’s the “rerun/celebrity” effect so prevalent in that generation. He’s been around for 50 years, so it’s his turn.

                                    Yes, I’m sure they initially ran Biden as a sensible, reasonable candidate. But note now that the Dems, rather than ditch him, which is the reasonable thing to do, are circling the wagons and backing him to the hilt. To me, what this means is that Dems do not strategize around traditional criteria such as experience, judiciousness, sobriety, etc. Rather, what drives their choices are rank ideology and anti-traditional identity. All other considerations are ancillary. And this is why Big Mike has a real shot at the brass ring, if he wants it.

            I think there is a natural belief on this side that we are dealing with all-powerful, unbelievably competent super-geniuses who are operating at 33-dimensional chess at all times. I get it, but I also think you can look at the people in charge, and see that they are very, very, very stupid, and while they wield a lot of institutional power, they don’t wield it very well.Biden has been in bad shape for a long time but they’ve managed to Weekend at Bernie’s him for long enough, thanks to drugs, teleprompters, etc. I have been yelling into the void about this guy’s dementia but he’s been able to put on good performances, most recently at the SOTU. Yet he has deteriorated rapidly the past few months. This is entirely consistent with his disease. It’s gotten so bad they couldn’t handle it. I really think it’s that simple. They had an inflated sense of their own competence and skill to manage Biden’s decline, just like they have an inflated sense of their own competence and skill in EVERYTHING.As for why they set the debate in June, my guess is that they figured Trump would be getting wiped out in court case after court case and Biden could land the kill short early and coast. They probbaly figured they could get Trump off the ticket which would lead to chaos on the GOP side. On this, of course, they totally failed, in large part because they let the court cases be handled by some really stupid and incompetent people – there’s that competence issue again.

                In AINO, when competence butts up against diversity, diversity wins every time. And this, more than anything, is why wings are falling off 747s, the military can’t build a pier, and everytime you order a drumstick and a Coke from Popeyes you get the shrimp bucket and a sweet tea.

                I think there is a natural belief on this side that we are dealing with all-powerful, unbelievably competent super-geniuses who are operating at 33-dimensional chess at all times
The only part of the above I agree with is the (almost) all-powerful.  That is only because they cling to power ruthlessly once acquired, using it to reward friends and right-thinkers, and punish enemies and wrong-thinkers.  Genius and 33 dimensional chess have nothing to do with it.

I tend to believe that people believe in evil super geniuses because it comforts them in some way. Without a solid faith in God, all they have is our overlords call the shots. It’s a bit much to believe they are also lucky to find their car keys.

            Clerical error.When it was decided that “global warming” would be called “climate change” from now on, not everyone got the memo. Many lefties, some prominent enough to be on the insiders’ mailing list, were outraged. A few even went to press. They recognized that “climate change,” the phrase, was an op, but they live in a world of stupid fantasy, so they thought it wasourop, right-wing newspeak to hide what’s really happening—warming.They cited Newt Gingrich’s new use of “climate change” as proof.Then they were told to shut the fuck up.In a few days Biden will once again be America’s sharpest political mind, bravest overcomer of speech impediments, and nimblest navigator of stages and stairs. Trump, by contrast, will be crippled by dementia.Nothing matters less than reality.

            Regarding women ruling in place of their demented husbands.  DOCTOR Jill was in Columbus, GA yesterday on a campaign event at Fort Benning, now called Fort Moore.
This is the easiest type of campaign event there is.  Give a short speech, shake a few hands, take a few pictures with the troops and take no questions.
My wife who pays no attention to politics asked me why she was there in place of Joe.  I told her Joe was having a bad day and needed a nap.

                    Knew it had been renamed.  Despise the leadership for that whole renaming thing.  But didn’t know it was Ft Moore.  Looked it up and it was named after Hal Moore — the guy Mel Gibson played inWe Were Soldiers Once.” Standard issue white guy,
My guess is they were throwing smoke so they could say it wasn’t all racially motivated ….
Moore was the genuine article; but I don’t believe it should be done.  Soldiers I’ve talked to — active and retired — of same sentiment.
I doubt he would have approved, himself.

Don’t forget the attraction a white face has for the nonwhites and nonstraights- they go to strength, that’s why streets or places renamed for loser figureheads end up with nobody but losers going there. They’re conquered territory, already razed, no valuables left to strip.

                    Considering the PC crowd that runs the military, it is a surprising choice.
General Benning was a blue eyed Ice Devil.  He was born and raised in Columbus, GA.  He was a lawyer, judge and politician.  He raised an infantry unit in Columbus and fought in many Civil War battles.
Hal Moore was an Army general and fought in Korea and Vietnam.  He was awarded the DSC, the second highest military decoration.  He wrote the book, We Were Soldiers Once.  Mel Gibson portrayed him in the movie.

Same. It was very noticeable here in Denmark because the media is considerably more Commie than in America: suddenly, the entire gaggle synchronously snapped about like so many cheerleaders, from “you’re a right-wing conspiracy nut if you question the state of Biden’s brain” to “oh, no, the guy is completely out to lunch” in 24 hours.

            I speculated here a week or so ago that they deliberately took Biden off his magic undead pills and let him loose on stage. The problem is what to replace him with. I agree that Big Mike is probably the best of a bad lot but I still think there’s enough remaining common sense among rank and file Lefties that an obvious DMV lady can’t be President. They’ll allsaythey’re voting for Mike but will spend election day drunk on Bud Light. For the same reason, they can’t really use Kamala Harris. What they need is a male candidate with no past. Basically, they need another Obama. The supply of sketchy “Hawaiian negros” though must be pretty small. In fact I think we would have seen a trial balloon by now. Of course, in a perfect Democrat universe they would just run a literal robot preloaded with all the correct views.

                Personally, I think they just couldn’t believe that money/drugs doesn’t reverse dementia. I suspect the PTB knew the debate would be bad, thus explaining the timing. I don’t think they anticipated facing dementia on stage.The Cloud People are shocked, embarrassed, and disturbed. They really believe in Biden as president and money/medicine and cure all. Us dirt people have seen dementia and the limits medicine a few times.

        I don’t see current-year America like France, 1791 but rather like a prison yard. People will rise up, eventually, but for different reasons. The Mexican gang will take offence to some transgression; the black gang will take offense to some punishment, and the white gang will take offense to injustice. Indian gangs and Chinese gangs will view the chaos from afar and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, and may prosper from the fallout. All the while the (((prison guards))) start quitting their jobs.

            Another good example would be the protestant revolt.  The problems in the Catholic Church kept increasing pressure until the unified church fractured into many pieces.  When the US system goes, there will be competing factions.
The French revolution was a more homogeneous peasant revolt that will not happen here.

        It’s not that normie will wake up if this one incontrovertible fact is exposed, as Q hypnotized some to imagine. Instead, a preference cascade would enable the cover for other things.I do think the mocking from some – the gist of which is that all the tough Americans are really sissies because they haven’t all taken up their ARs and started stacking bodies – is somewhat off the mark. Such actions would be suicide not because the FBI is so terribly smart, but because normie would pick up the phone and rat everyone out.Ted Kaczynski’s brother turned him in to the cops. In a world where everyone read the manifesto and agreed with it, that wouldn’t happen. Very few would begin sending mail bombs to academics, but the ones who did would find that nobody was dropping a dime on them. That’s the difference.

            “I do think the mocking from some – the gist of which is that all the tough Americans are really sissies because they haven’t all taken up their ARs and started stacking bodies – is somewhat off the mark.”My mocking of those people is not because they aren’t violent, but because they give up in a million other ways through daily cuckery.  Conservatives see themselves as the inheritors of ancient manliness, but are held over a barrel by men in dresses and degenerate women.What use is that kind of manliness, where you sit passively by until the world becomes mad max, and only then take action?  I’m not talking about violence here when I say take action.If right wing masculinity can’t deal with any problems until it becomes a matter of life or death, then how is it useful at all?   We would just be doomed to repeat the same cycle after the collapse and rebuilding.

                There are other, peaceful ways to take action. It starts with boycotts (no NFL, no Target, no Bud Light), pulling your kids from the education camp system, redpilling those around you, supporting activists like Z, Rufo, Ramzpaul. Build up your family and community. Seek the Lord.
Lack of faith in God is what is driving the disaster in Europe: Europeans just don’t have the confidence or ideas to oppose Islam, communism or degenerate multiculturalism. The Godly Boers in South Africa, however, are strong people.

See what I mean? Boycotts are nonsense, speaking up in town councils is nonsense, removing your kids from public schools is simply admitting defeat, etc. Imposing your will on someone else is always and everywhere a violent act.
How were schools integrated? Well, through the bayonets of the 101st Airborne, as the picture shows. The idea that there exist un-chosen alternatives is naïve.

Conservatives refused to ever use their legal authority, when in power, to root out these problems.
Instead of using official state-sanctioned violence to crush the left, they prefer to have gun-stroking fantasies where they will shoot looters after civil order completely collapses.

                        The problem is they never actually have legal authority.  The ‘dirt conservatives’ are never going to get close to power.The ‘cloud conservatives’ are leftists.  Ask any of these ‘cloud conservatives’ about all the anti-white racism in areas like employment and you’ll get a lecture about Martin Lufer Kang!But even if the ‘dirt conservatives’ ever got power, it’s not in their nature to wield said power and use it to crush their enemies and reward their friends.I entirely agree with you about the utter fantasies of powerless conservatives dreaming of the day they will be allowed to actually fight back after the country collapses or something.

                    It’s not so simple. Persistent persuasion through civil acts can change a country’s mental climate and make violent action possible because either supported by or countenanced by the state. The state was able to send in the 101st Airborne because America’s mental climate had been altered to such an extent that such action was acceptable. If the US guv tried that shit 30 years earlier they would have met with armed white mobs pulling triggers and lobbing incendiary devices.

                            In my example, I was talking about state violence. The vast majority of the time, any government will consider the likely response–or lack of same–from the masses before using force. Therefore, those whose acts have conditioned the mentality of the masses will have obliquely influenced the state’s use or avoidance of violence.

                Men are accountable. A lot of guys want the glory without the price. Not talking blood and guts, either. Simple things like being unpopular and ruffling feathers. Too many people do the gray man bit and skirt by. Keep playing gray man, it gets to a point where you have to play gray man. Like the saying about an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure.

                    Or this saying which is directly in line with that…If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed;if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you maycome to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may even be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves…Now just to be clear we are already past the easily win part, the sure victory and are knocking on the odds being against us and a precarious chance of survival but do we really want to wait til there is no hope for victory???

            Gotta point this out, for Whiskey:Ted’s brother knew for a long time.On his own he’d have kept the secret, but he’d told his wife (???!!!) and she nagged him to turn Ted in. She didn’t do it herself—and she never would have. But she “shit-tested” him daily, because he’s a weenie. Eventually he failed.The “beta” move of sacrificing his brother to the “alpha” cops did not improve his sex life. In interviews she seeks the camera—the official eye—and he shrinks from it. She acknowledges him only to gloat over her victory, to make him admit it.“Didn’t I?”Choose your brother’s wife wisely.

            Q didn’t hypnotize anybody except maybe you and people like you who keep repeating the same drivel fed to you by the establishment GOP. Q was a series of information drops, some real, some disinformation. But Q isn’t the only place the information came from. The information was fed through a bunch of different channels like FBI Anon. They were facilitated directly by Trump since only Trump could give authorization for what was released or haven’t you noticed that the drops practically stopped once Trump stopped being president?If Q was a scam, why did Trump tease it at his rallies?If Q was a scam, why did Eric Trump appear on what is perhaps the number one Q podcast on Thanksgiving Day 2 years ago?

                                I don’t know why that would frighten you, Q is just a communication strategy to seed a lot of truths that would be unbelievable if you hit people with them all at once. People don’t give enough credit to human instincts being able to sift through what is truth and what isn’t. That’s why Q caught on. We would never have known about pedos and Jeffrey Epstein blackmailing the power structure if it wasn’t seeded through Q first. Lots of other things that got into the public realm after being posted there first.

My guess, knowing nothing about that podcast, is he was on it for the same reason almost anyone’s on a podcast: Clout or grift.
Q isn’t real, it’s never been real, and you should really know that considering how often you post on here.

            I disagree. We should mock them relentlessly.  They will never fight.  People who won’t fight when the consequences are fairly easy will not fight when the consequences are life and death.  Those who will not fight with the pen or the courts or in propaganda will never fight with the sword.  If civilization was to collapse for some reason, they will have an all new list of reasons this is not the time to fight.What we should mock them for the loudest is their pronouncements that if the law tries to take their guns away, that’s when they will fight.  They don’t even realize what they are saying.  They’re saying “I’ll never use the tool for anything other than having the tool”  In the meanwhile, their gun will remain locked up safely and separately from the ammunition.Had they not been cowards 60 years ago, we would not be in the position we are in today.

                It’s worse than that.  The mouth breathers on Freerepublic make jokes about losing their guns in boating accidents when the government comes for their guns.  What they are saying is they will never fight even WHEN they come for their guns.
They will keep them hidden somewhere, which will just be a ticking time bomb for a felony conviction if any spiteful x-spouse or neighbor rats them out.

                I fear I haven’t made myself understood. Lemme try again.You are entirely right to say the great majority of fat Americans with ARs will never, ever, ever do anything at all. Ever.You are wrong to think that cowardice decades ago put us in the current terrible situation. People did do all the non-violent, resisting things, but they lost all the elections and lost all the court cases, and lost all the school board fights, and lost all the HR policy directives. And supporting all those losses was literally the 101st Airborne Division, with soldiers herding White kids to school at the point of a bayonet.Deciding against suicide is not cowardice. Had they got their guns and put up a fight, they would be dead. Simple as.The situation is similar today. January 6th was nothing *except* people who were taking a stand because they were not cowards. You can look for them now, if you like.However. A preference cascade would make room for some of the genuinely violent types out there to do the various doings without the fear that they will be caught. Guerrillas always rely on the tacit support of the population, for example. Almost nobody in Ireland sniped a British soldier, but almost everyone supported and kept quiet about the ones who did.There is no model where everybody gets their guns and rises up against their oppressors. That’s not a thing. There are lots of models where a small number of violent men are supported by a much larger number of sympathizers. That’s what this is about.

        The lefty elites are turning on Biden the same way they turned on Johnson in 1968.The Kennedy snobs hated Johnson, they hired him simply to get gravitas on the ticket and to get the Southern rubes to vote for the rich Cape Cod Yankees.The Obama people treated Biden the same way. The young, queer, brown, female lefties in the Obama coalition hated the old white male bullshit artist, but he had been around D.C. forever and would serve as an emissary to the old white people who would have ordinarily been wary of the gay Marxist Kenyan mulatto.After Kennedy’s death, Johnson knew he had to pander to the Left if he wanted a legacy, but he also needed to pander to the MIC and to keep the Republicans from calling him soft on communism so he went full-bore on Vietnam, and the Left, who never loved him in the first place, turned on him.Biden also knew he had to pander to the young, black, and queer Obama constituency, but he also had to pander to the Israel lobby and the MIC. Now that he is senile and the Left is furious with his fellating Bibi and enabling the Gaza slaughter, they are abandoning him

        “but that same herd mentality is preventing them from changing opinions on the matter.”The herd mentality may be one factor but it’s arguably not the only one and in this case probably not the main one. As you indicate, the new herd consensus agrees with what people have been thinking privately for years but were too chicken to say so out loud. Just like they’re too craven to speak up about racial disparities in crime and educational attainment. Team Biden’s argument is eesentially this: “Ignore what your lying eyes and ears are telling you.” But as in the Hans Christian Anderson story (“The Emperor’s New Clothes”), once they realise the emperor is naked and the herd consensus agrees with what their own eyes and ears are telling them, there’s no way of going back to the old consensus. The genie is out of this particular bottle.Biden could still step down voluntarily with some honor and dignity intact. But he — or perhaps his family? — has decided to dig his heels in and try to brazen it out. And so he is going to be dragged out kicking and screaming, with no honor and no dignity, and in an ignominious, degrading, and humiliating fashion. And since I always despised this piece of crap I’m going to enjoy the spectacle.

            Biden never had honor nor dignity.  He was known as an intellectual midget and a serial liar from the get-go.  And his hand was always digging deeper into the cookie jar than many of his fellow thieves.  But the White American voter of 1970 thought he was just great – an infusion of ‘new ideas’ into the US Congress.  And they kept right on voting for him.  The public spectacle will not make one iota of difference.  Biden is an excellent representative of his voters.  It’s bread and circuses from top to bottom.

                In my world, people don’t get choices on who vote for. The primaries select the candidates and that’s the end of it. A guy like Biden would have had a complete lock on elections for decades. Thus how oligarchies rule democracies.He maybe be arepresentativeof his voters, but it’s not necessarily because even a majority of them thought he was a great idea for decades.Part of the reason that the Cloud people love democracy is that ordinary people lay the blame for their vices/bad decisions at the feet of our fellow citizens.

        I wonder how it will play out, because I see the current mess people are fighting as a sort of French or Russian revolution. Iow, the revolt isn’t against hierarchy but against democracy. Peasants want leaders again, instead of managers. Bit of a white pill, if the USSR’s example is typical.OTOH, America will never be as hierarchical as Russia, unless it ceases to be America. Americans have a tradition of self government, which would be our saving grace. The problem is, I’d bet upwards of half of the people living here (I hope that’s not optimistic), don’t have that tradition, iow, aren’t Americans. The dirt, the ideas— even the religion— aren’t magic, imo. People are mostly what they naturally are, take it up with God. So the question is if America can still be America.

            America really is unlike anywhere else. We saw that with COVID. I always thought countries like Israel and Australia were freedom-loving, but they bent the knee like everyone else, even to excess. Here, however, there was mighty skepticism from the git-go and huge anti-vax, anti-lockdown rebellion. Once you left the (Democrat-run) cities, nobody enforced mandates. And even in the Dem cities, Blacks were the most anti-vax group.

                        Yes, I’ve noticed their parading around with the larger face masks, both sexes. “Flashy, gaudy, and provocative” such great descriptive words;-) Here’s something else that fits the bill: their women use hyphenated last names to tedious excess, i. e. Ketanji Brown Jackson, Karine Jeanne-Pierre. (Sorry it’s hot and I can’t think of any others at the moment.) Also, forcing us to look at names with misplaced accents (D’equantavious,L’Queesha etc) and strange name spellings like that judge’s in Nashville who won’t release the Covenant shooter’s “Manifesto.” They want everyone to take areally long timeto pay attention to them, even if it’s only the folks in the Booking Division at the Sheriff’s Office.

        When children hear the story about “The Emperor’s New Clothes”, they come away with the moral that boldly speaking truth to power about the obvious has a happy ending.
Adults, however, understand that speaking truth to power, even against the most blatant, ridiculous, and silly falsehoods means heavy handed punishment.
Biden is an obvious candidate for the current “emperor”, but more depressingly, it’s really America.  Everyone knows it.

            ProZNoV:  Heavy-handed punishment from the regime is to be expected.  What endlessly galls me, however, is the rest of the murkans piling on the boy speaking ‘truth to power’ and screeching that he’s delusional, imagining conspiracy theories, and believing lies.  They’re all onrecord as admiring the emperors clothes more than their neighbor does.  If/when some of them finally acknowledge the truth, I’m supposed to suddenly trust that their choices and easily-swayed passions will align with mine – let alone reality?  Not hardly.

        “In the fullness of time, we may look at this ongoing populist revolt as a genuine defense of the system by the public because they still believed in the system.”They might, but they aren’t motivated. I don’t see a Vendee’ Revolt coming in Iowa, or White Russians saddling up in Montana ready to ride or die. Is the populist revolt we see now true belief in the system, or is it longing and lamentations for the fruits of the system – good jobs, cheap consumer goods, stable communities – that have disappeared over the last 25 years? I’m not sure myself.

        So which is it? We are all micro managed by the “managerial elite”, or we are all independent thinkers kept silent by fear of reprisals until the 100th monkey suddenly notices an alleged world leader soils himself publicly and voices our private doubts aloud?Is the media the rather obvious Ministry of Truth of AmSoc, or is it staffed with honest but timid Nelly Blys capable of organically changing THE MESSAGE once they reach a critical mass?Are we living in an unprecedented in History, full spectrum, cradle to grave Mind Control Matrix, or do we sometimes lapse into short periods of grassroots activity capable of exerting an impact on the direction of the Narrative which influences the behaviors and policies of the Inner Party?Are the claims that we are all equal participants in the System true, and that this is the most glorious of all possible Freedoms, or is all access to positions of real influence jealously guarded and denied to the peasants with their preference cascaded doubts and their outmoded disinclination to be racially replaced and genocided?The DR appears to have a serious Double Think problem.

            Regrettably, your post cuts plumb center, especially the bit about the Regime Media’s sudden spark of independence. I have always said–and I think this is the general DR position–that the media is nothing more than the propaganda organ of the Power Structure. But if that is the case, then their volte face regarding Joey Depends cannot be the result of preference confirmation. Rather, the media received the Bat Signal from Sauron and his ministers, and its condemnation of Biden demonstrates that he is now in foul odor with the Power Structure. We can’t have it both ways.

        There’s more to it than just a sudden realization.  Why have a debate a month or more before the conventions?Because the people who want Biden gone needed the public to see Biden unfiltered.  I don’t think their plan was fully baked, and not all media outlets got the message to dump Biden, but it’s clear somebody wanted him on live TV without handlers or a T-prompter.  Pitted against the people who orchestrated the TV drama are the people taking in big $$$$ from the Biden grift machine.For their part, the Biden’s are not without power.  It’s hard to shove an incumbent off the stage.  They can buy a lot of votes.  They’re arrogant and stupid enough to believe they can win in November without Black Jesus and the vote printing schemes in Philly, Madison, Detroit, etc.  They also calculate that Obama cannot afford to abandon Biden and let him lose.  If Biden stays in, they have no choice but to support him because the alternative looks very bad for them.The list of grievances and retributions planned against Democrats is growing rapidly.  Lawfair is a two way street, for example.  Ukraine money laundering is in peril.  A wipeout of years of carefully infiltrating communists into the Federal bureaucracy is in MAJOR PERIL.  SCOTUS just ruled in favor of the Unitary Executive.  The President IS the Executive Branch and can fire and declassify anyone and anything he wants.I suspect the Biden’s are trying to figure out whether POTATUS can be simply removed at the Convention.  If they decide Joe cannot be pulled, and that Obama has no choice but to support him, November could be quite epic.

            “Because the people who want Biden gone needed the public to see Biden unfiltered.”This assumes that the people now screeching about Biden are voicing organic opinions which they have suddenly developed after watching his “debate’, and that the Rulers calculated this would be the public’s response.But this is nonsense. Biden has been unfit since he announced his candidacy against Trump. Before the Rulers locked down YT there were dozens of videos featuring Biden pawing and groping women and small children. This was a man so feeble he ran his campaign from his basement. A man so out of touch he signed off on ” No Malarkey” as a clever campaign slogan.Since the obvious theft of the election there have been multiple examples of criminality and increasing senility. From the stumbling on the steps of AF One to the refusal to take questions at press conferences, the vacant stares and inability to focus, the stench of public defecations (plural), the inability to remember his own lies, the increasingly fantastic nature of his confabulations– the only people who have not known for years that Biden is a boiled cabbage are those who have no thoughts or opinions other than what the TV tells them to “believe” on any topic.The idea that people so irretrievably brainwashed have now “woken up”, or that the administrators of the Thought Control Ray staged this debate in order to rouse their dupes into forming a different opinion about Biden, is unsound and I do not believe it.People who have been swearing that 2+2=5 forat leastthe past 4 years (and really, for all their lives) do not suddenly break free of the iron vise that controls their brains and start having epiphanies.The Rulers have no further use for the Biden puppet, or this staged and engineered kerfluffle is being used to shift public opinion in some way. I don’t know what’s going on, but none of this is organic.Nobody is changing their minds; they are having their software updated. Believing that the proles are having epiphanies is only a short leap from believing elections are real and meaningful.

The event planners have got the election season pretty well figured out, it’s every four years. What if POTATUS were the EBT cards going down, the Cyber Polygon, the BLM, the planned terrorist event?
That is, a time bomb. An excuse. A known quantity to provide useful disruption at a predetermined time.

                That’s what I mean when I say the media reporting has been uneven.  The “we just noticed he’s a vegetable” act only played on some media outlets, but not others.  That’s why I don’t think it’s a “preference cascade” but rather Avery Polly orchestrated attempt to create one.Where the Wizards of Smart are blind is they assume either Biden will drop out voluntarily, or, that the public won’t act on the artificial “preference cascade” TPTB initiated.  The goal of this was to use a fake preference cascade to get Biden out, then replace him at the convention.what happens if they unleash this cascade, but Biden stays in?  I do not believe they’ve war games that possibility.  Which is why James Clyburn is out running vote rigging ops for Biden in all these swing states and saying he’s “Ridin’ with Biden” today.It reminds me a lot of Ukraine.  They did A, B, and C.  This was supposed to result in Ukraine winning the war, Russia’s economy collapsing, and Putin being overthrown.  Except it didn’t.That debate was meant to trap Biden into dropping out.  What happens if he doesn’t?

        If they can push Biden off the ticket, then they can say that they found out, they took swift action, the system works and you can trust it. It would be an obvious lie, but they can say it, and these sorts of lies are lies they are very comfortable with (see, “most secure election in history”, “hallmarks of Russian disinformation”, “trust the science”, “why dont people understand how great Bidenomics is for them?”, etc.). The longer this goes on, though, the longer it will be a problem for the regime. There is simply no plausible deniability regarding Biden’s health anymore. The whole world saw it. They can’t hide it. If he stays on the ticket, the already-low trust in the regime will rapidly deteriorate, in a way that, as Z points out, they won’t be able to predict or manage. Heck, their own belief in their own abilities to create their own reality is what led Biden to that debate stage.

            Yep, if Biden stays in the regime won’t be able to “fortify” the results because literally no one would believe in a Crooked Joe victory.  The regime HAS to jettison his corpse.

                Half the country didn’t believe in the last one and it didn’t seem to matter. Why should it be different this time around?
The only thing that they might be worried about is getting enough corpses to fight for isreal, or against Putin or Xi.  That is a real concern.

        I don’t know, I still see plenty of goobs flying the Stars and Stripes – granted they’re mostly boomer goobs, but still.  If they can’t see that the US government is nothing but corrupt and evil and stands for nothing but death, destruction and degeneracy – and has for a long time, they’re freaking hopeless.  The little town where we have a 2nd home had a parade – granted, it is a bit nostalgic, but I really couldn’t care less – I just don’t understand the patriotism, rah, rah, USA, USA anymore.  People need to open their damn eyes.

        If a revolt ever comes some day how will manifest itself? A revolution at the gated ballot box? Nothing can happen there. More “insurrections” or impromptu scaffold building everywhere?
Something has to come that our overseers will fear greatly and implement change, but what? I find it odd that there hasn’t been some major terrorist type event happen from the fringe. Mass shootings of innocents doesn’t count.
Trump winning will do little.

We don’t make anything anymore, everything is held up through money printing.  The world is our slave because we have the reserve currency.  The collapse of the dollar would be like a nuclear war, but with the buildings still standing.

            Naw. I think it manifests itself by a mysterious ability for the genuinely violent to operate without getting caught. Recall that the FBI really only solves crimes that a) they instigate themselves or b) when are told who did the crime. Normie’s preference cascade just means that he’s not going to pick up the phone and call the local field office to tell them about some weird guys who might be involved in that thing that’s in the news.

            My “revolt” will be moving to South America. I think even the Ozarks won’t be safe territory once the implosion commences. Nor The Yoop, which is my current Plan B. For now, I see no value in planning for revolution, I would only be fighting for tbis faction or that faction. There is no common rallying point because too mamy whites are hostile to identity or complacent.

                        For extensive work ups, and in the future should I require a procedure, I fly to Amman, Jordan. The medical teams there are smart, investigative and welcome queries, and it costs a lot less. For medicines, my cousin in LA drives into Mexico for me and then couriers the stuff back. He was my source for vitamin i et al. during the early covidiot hysteria. I have enough resources to buy a gated vineyard/farm in Argentina’s outback complete with security and landing strip. No blacks. I have a shot at my end days being peaceful and whole circle down there.

You’d be better off just walling yourself off here in a liberal enclave which is effectively what Spaniard descended Castizos already do there. “South America” will 100% be here in your lifetime. Why waste all the time &amp; effort when the global south is coming to you directly? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                    Argentina is white as hell and very European in culture. The farther south you travel in South America, the whiter it becomes just as historically the farther north you travel in the northern hemisphere the fewer darkly hued folks you meet (eskimoes/inuits excepted). I love Alaska but am seriously considering South America residence, otherwise, probably Alaska, which would be my preference but I’ve learned some things that may not make it optimal.

        Spectacular as usual, Z. But… I’m not buying it.it’s all too fake and gay. The media mavens? All of a sudden realizing Joe can’t do the job? All, suddenly finding their courage and backbone at once – after years of covering for him?Here’s my theory: they’ve been punched in the face by reality. The jig is up. Normies and Grillers have had enough. The narrative collapsed, and even their own factions are starting to revolt. Consider this shitlib lunatic:http://eb-misfit.blogspot.com/2024/07/my-letter-to-ny-times.html“The NYT is in the bag for Trump!!!1!” 😂😂😂There is a power vacuum on America’s left, and the infighting is going to be epic. The sharks smell blood in the water and see weakness – and they are going to devour Joe and each other as they fight for control. The press is trying to put themselves above the warring factions – it’s their only hope of survival. Joe is obviously going down, they will jump back in bed with whoever survives once the new leaders are established.

        I just did a bunch of searches on the Democrat’s Senators and Congresszherzhis. Here is a good one:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ray_Luj%C3%A1nHis statement was, “He (Biden) is not a convicted felon. He should stay in the race.” Lujan’s great contribution to GAE is he is a former blackjack dealer. The litany goes on.Hakeem Jeffries is always handled by Schumer. This thing breaks when the Black Caucus and their faction wig out when everything they wanted was just in their grasp but before it slips away more fire alarms get pulled.Ilhan Omar says she has Biden’s back and he has been the best President of her lifetime.If only we could see what bribes, bounty and whatever else is going on in the Democrat camp to force the fringe coalition together – meaning doing what Schumer and the boys say they must do.White men need to get organized. We aren’t ready for when this blows gaskets. Not nearly ready. Keep making progress though!This dumpster fire is just getting started.

        Oh, the same people still wave the flag. They just wave it from their front porch instead of the front lines, and have scribbled “Molon Labe” across the stripes.
Note that Biden’s slack-faced appearance on Shocking Thursday was somewhat worse on his left side. This is the hallmark of a minor stroke.

            Redirecting the public’s disgust at the invading brown hordes at “tourists” (white people) is a regime-manufactured phenomenon all over the world right now. Japan has fallen especially hard for it, because they don’t expect the media to lie to them.
If they let us see it, it’s fake.

            Yes, the homies in Barcelona have had enough. Check out the photo of the two women in two-piece BATHING SUITS on BICYCLES being halted by crowds holding banners decrying the tourist invasion. I have seen the same scene (certain women in scanty bathing suits) at our summer place this past weekend. It’s kind of weird because they don’t need to “tan” and hardly any of them like or even know how to swim! Here they ride around on rental golf carts. Awful ropey hair braids down the back. Again, it’s all about “look at me” and if no one does, then do something — throw a chair? — to attract attention. Useless idiots.

        I wonder if something like this could happen in the case of Project Ukraine.  Nigel Farage has already stated that NATO had been provoking Russia prior to the commencement of the Special Military Operation, although he still characterizes the Russian action as unjustified.  It will be increasingly difficult to conceal that things are not going well for Ukraine on the battlefield, that the Russian economy is doing just fine under sanctions and that Russia and China are gaining world-wide diplomatic support for their respective positions.  If there are a lot of private doubts about the justification for, and the progress of Project Ukraine, it could suddenly come crashing through, just as is happening in the case of Joe Biden’s cognitive capacity.  Best if it happens before the November elections.

        The One Way begins when the plates stop spinning and the EBT cards stop working. Hence, why not do some contingency planning? We need an antidote to the cyber sickness that currently keeps people apart in real life. So why not plan a real march on DC measured in millions of participants rather than a few hundred. And do it smarter this time. By the book and in full compliance with Constitutional rights. Long caravans starting on the West Coast and gathering size as they move east. A convergence on the Mall. Then let the Jackboots be the overt trigger rather than the covert cowards they were last time. May the best man win.

Tom’s March is a golden opportunity staring MAGA in the face, shouting and calling, “To me!  To me!  Avengers, assemble!”  This is the moment the 2As and Christians and a zillion others havewaitedfor all their lives.
