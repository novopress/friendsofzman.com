        The ‚Äúblame the old‚Äù excuse is ridiculous, and could only survive in a culture which doesn‚Äôt value history, even the most recent.  How old is ‚Äúold‚Äù in this case?  Over 50, like me?  Must be, because I doubt there are enough over 80s in England to swing the vote their way.  People in their 50s were children when Britain entered the EU.  Unlike today‚Äôs young people, they not only grew up in it, they matured in it.  They lived long enough to see where all the big promises and happy talk would lead, and they decided that they‚Äôd been lied to for long enough.

            But, that sort of hate think must always be prohibited. If we start remembering things we‚Äôll never make it to the vibrant future.

            One thing Remain forgot in the campaign was that old buggers like me have seen over the past forty years what the EU was really up to. Staying put and not making waves* was being sold as ‚Äòthe future‚Äô which had no link to the past in any way (and one that carefully avoided mentioning Belsen, Normandy, etc.). The young had no such recollection of such an ancient time, and can only see some sort of hazy golden futures where all live in harmony because there are laws that say it must be so.Don‚Äôt forget too that we are of the Faceberg era, and all young people supposedly want to ‚Äòbefriend‚Äô everyone in the world on the basis that all young people of whatever religion, culture or outlook are all the same. Yes, even your middle-east raised muslim just wants to party and have fun. Anyway, many of the young can‚Äôt understand why everyone doesn‚Äôt like rap and refuses to smoke something that makes you light in the head. The EU to a lot of yoof is just a big party (though I don‚Äôt see Mrs Merkel as the ultimate disco queen, sorry.)*In the ‚Äòsixties the yoof I grew up with built barricades in the quest for freedom and tried to burn cities, but now they just want to say ‚Äúlolz‚Äù on social media and change the world, one hashtag at a time.

                @ UKer ‚Äì We all know monetary policy and devaluation of a currency is at the whim of those who control the markets. If Angela Merkel trips on the steps of the Bundestag, the Euro drops 2% for no other apparent reason. So the recent devaluation of the pound following the Brexit to me is nothing more than media scaremongering and corporate bankers revenge.But, I must ask two questions:1.) Do you really think the UK will be able to rebound and rebuild it‚Äôs failed industries?2.) How much do you think Britain‚Äôs problems are self inflicted and how much are really the fault of bad EU policy?I don‚Äôt think it is unfair to say that the majority of British industry has been in the tank for years; from steel, to automotive, to ship building and so much (like the US) has been outsourced. Not to mention the problems of the labor unions ‚Äì it was as if the Brits were in competition with the French for who could strike the most.Is it likely the window of opportunity has already closed for Britain to regain it‚Äôs position on the global market? Let‚Äôs be honest, the Japanese beat the Brits at building good, reliable small cars well before the UK entering the EU and VW, Toyota and BMW have done very well in recent years in contrast to Rover, MG and other native British brands. China has flooded the world market with steel and both China and south Korea are currently the largest ship builders.So now that you are out of the EU, how do you foresee the UK getting back into the global game?

        In the case of the Brexit, I wonder how much of the difference between the youth vote and the older vote can be explained by the fact that the proportion of voters named ‚ÄúMuhammed‚Äù or ‚ÄúAbdullah‚Äù is so much higher in the former category than the latter.  After all, the Brexit sends a strong signal that immigration may be coming to a close and you soon may not be able to import your first cousin bride from Lahore or Aleppo (getting back to that idea).If I was a young Briton namedFlorence or Ollie, I‚Äôd think that I‚Äôd want to get behind my elders just this once.

            We were all young once and we know that being young means, among other things, being reckless and stupid. No offense to the ladies, but the dumbest human walking earth is a 20-something unmarried female. Once they get married and start having kids they begin to wise up, but until then they are a slave to their biology. Males are not much better, but they also tend not to vote in youth so they are less of a problem.

                I was in the Emerald City this weekend and had precisely the same thought after I saw about the 20th young lady in her scanties out running alone.  At least most of them weren‚Äôt wearing headphones.

                        A bit of obscure Americana.  There is a theory that the Wizard of Oz was actually a political satire. The yellow brick road is the gold standard, the Cowardly Lion represents WilliamJennings Bryant, etc.  Washington D. C. is the Emerald City according to this interpretation.

                Not to be a jerk, but the drift of the country got a swift kick when women got the vote,‚Ä¶ and then even more when the Democrats spearheaded dropping the voting age to 18.  Funny, huh.  Almost as if a nefarious plot.

                        When I find myself in a conversation concerning universal suffrage I ask my interlocutor if they believe strongly in universal suffrage, they invariably answer yes.

        Is funny how virtually every argument, including all the cutesy memes put up on Facebook, against the Leave vote consists of variations on how dumb the other side is.  No argument on the economic or political merits, simply crap like, ‚ÄúNow we know that there is a nation dumber than the US‚Äù.  In the few discussions I‚Äôve had with Remainers, simply open with ‚ÄúHave you ever had to do business in the EU?‚Äù.  So far all answers have been ‚Äúno‚Äù.  But they do know somebody that is going to be inconvenienced in the passport line going on holiday.  Since I have had the experience‚Äìnever ever, ever voluntarily try to shut something down in Belgium and redomesticate it to the UK‚ÄìI explain what the layers of local country and EU regulations are like.  And how much effort goes into ongoing operations.  It is though you are speaking Urdu. Absolutely no impression at all.  Frankly the turmoil in the financial markets is because the Brits have dared to utter the truth about what a complete clusterfuck the EU Central bank is and the folly of imposing a single currently across sound northern European and unsound southern European economies.  A fiscal death pact if there ever was one.  And frankly, more a German driven  effort to secure borrowing capacity in the south to shore up a massive seller financing scheme for exports.   Better to shake it out now than later.  The rot is simply going to get worse.

        One observation of the post-Brexit kerfuffle here in the UK has presented us with an astonishing and perhaps unexpected development related to the idea of democracy.An MP (a Labour member of parliament by name of David Lammy) has called for the referendum vote to be blocked in the House of Commons, making it clear while he applauds democracy when he was voted to power, he then uses that power to block democracy. His own petty interests and narrow view (and probably that of his close-and-closed circle of friends) trumps the right of the people to have their say.But then as most of us know, to the leftards ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô is just another virtue word to be bandied about. Like ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô and ‚Äòequality‚Äô it doesn‚Äôt mean what it is supposed to mean. One just uses it to earn nods from the chattering classes; the last thing one wants is to see is it in action.

            @ UKer ‚Äì It wouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone if the EU pushes the Brits to vote on this again, again, and again until they get it ‚Äúright‚Äù. Not unlike when they forced Ireland to vote again on the rejected Lisbon Treaty back in 2009. It‚Äôs the typical Brussels version of democracy ‚Äì keep the plebs voting until we get the results we want. Oddly enough, this is timed quite well with the European football season. Coincidence? I think not.

                That‚Äôs been my expectation. We see that in the states. The Left thinks the time is right to foist some new idiocy on the people of their state so they get a ballot initiative going. When it fails, they do it again and again until they get the result they like. At that point, they break out in the chant of ‚Äúsettled law‚Äù and claim any attempt to roll back the vote is an assault on democracy.That said, my bet is the mild rumbling in the markets is called a major catastrophe and used as an excuse to put everything on hold until markets settle down. This is to buy time and let the EU figure out how to respond. Once the phony crisis passes, there will be some new excuses as to why the Brits have to wait. Eventually, Labor will win Parliament and they will cancel the results of the referendum and that will be that.

                    I find it amusing that the ‚Äúremain‚Äù cult is blaming the ‚Äúold and uneducated‚Äù for the results. Oddly enough only 36% of 18-24 year olds even bothered to vote. While 81% of 55-64 year olds and 83% of the 65+ crowd turned out. Yes, I see it now ‚Äì it‚Äôs those old stupid people who ruin everything!

                        The follow on polling done to ask why people voted as they did is revealing. The Remain people were mostly concerned about economics, but something close to half are OK with the result. The Leave voters were mostly conserved about national sovereignty and the needs of the next generation.What‚Äôs clear is that the scare tactics of Remain missed the mark entirely and may have convinced some voters that they were not on the level. It‚Äôs an important reminder that people will vote for someone they trust, even if they disagree with them, when the alternative is someone they don‚Äôt trust. Barak Obama got a second term entirely due to no one believing anything Romney said about anything.

                                The opportunity for revival in the US is a direct result of the clarity we‚Äôve been provided by Obama‚Äôs reelection.  The left has played it‚Äôs cards.

        I think the big lightning bolt moment for me was when I realized my political stance could be summed up as ‚Äúanti-egalitarian.‚Äù Beyond a baseline moral equality, I just don‚Äôt think people are equal in ability or nature or life outcomes and I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible to make them so.

        The cult behavior you describe is not peculiar to liberals. Ideologues on both sides of the political spectrum tend to pivot away from a heretical thought like a school of fish. As you point out, they do it for the same reason: self-defense. They have invested themselves completely in their ideology, so any threat to it is a threat against their person. Thus, their response to criticism of their ideas is often an ad hominem attack. It‚Äôs what happens when an ideology ‚Äî any ideology or political idea ‚Äî becomes an end rather than a means to an end.

        Totalitarians love ‚Äúyouth‚Äù, as they are typically gullible cannon fodder and all.
Libs have boxed themselves in lately.  Their groupthink post-Orlando has placed the Muslim above the gay, and they risk losing a bunch of gay support.  Many gays, too, have realized who their real enemies are.  Finally, the less flamboyant gay community has found a sort of mutual acceptance and shared self-interest with much of the non-gay community, as mutual tolerance and acceptance (and shared targets on all of our foreheads) trump prior differences.  Strangely, Orlando has had a sort of ‚Äúmainstreaming‚Äù effect on much of the gay community.

Yes, the EU leaders, instead of falling on their swords like Cameron, will double down and apply their facist tactics because they cannot allow anyone to challenge them.  So expect Britain to be punished explicitly.  This will not be a consequence of wanting independence and normal change but a concerted effort to make an example out of Britain so others contemplating a similar move will be cowered back into line.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt EVEN think about it.‚Äù

        If the cult says the world is going to end tomorrow, it better end tomorrow. Otherwise, the cult collapses as it fails to comport with observable reality.
That‚Äôs actually not true. Leon Festinger wrote a book about a cult titled ‚Äúwhen prophecy fails‚Äù and the members became more enthusiastic supporters of the cult when the predicted disaster failed to occur. According to the prediction, California would be destroyed by floods but the cult members would be saved by flying saucers. Didn‚Äôt happen and the cult didn‚Äôt collapse‚Äô

        Just as the world elites will not let the UK leave the EU, they will also find a way to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president of the U.S. The Cult has become an unstoppable global phenomenon. There may be internal squabbles, but when it comes to overarching threats it will unite and not stop until the threat is destroyed. This is a bleak assessment, but since the Cult‚Äôs opposition consists basically of individuals who by definition can never achieve cultness, the outcome is inevitable. This is not to say that the Dirt People should give up. There is great honor in standing your ground and defending your values, in fighting on by whatever means come to hand. The many factions in the Cult will battle each other unto death some day. The strongest will emerge, and the result will be the kind of tyranny that Jefferson described as that which is legal for the government but illegal for the citizenry. We may be there already.

        Since I started reading your stuff, especially your comments about being ‚Äòborrowed‚Äô I notice it everywhere now. You were the first in the blog machine to use the Old Greek Proverb about the Trees that I noticed and now it has hit the YouTube set.

This Sargon guy presents as sensible left, but I sense that he is heading into the fringe. A wife and child can do that to a man thinking about the future.

            I read this blog, watch Sargon‚Äôs videos, and I used the proverb today, thinking I was being original.  Oops. How did I miss both of these guys using it before me?  That‚Äôs embarrassing.

        This is a wonderful, incisive, concise piece.  I don‚Äôt want to be petty or distract from the content, but no one else seems to have commented, so I will mention it.   I think you mean inherit, not ‚Äòinherent the earth‚Äô in the last paragraph.  Otherwise, perfect!

        You might want to read your post again and keep in mind the unfailing support for Donald Trump that you so often espouse.The absolute support for one man, the explaining away of things that don‚Äôt make sense (i.e. donating to Democrats), the ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù of those things suddenly becoming a meme among his followers (‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way the game is played‚Äù), the attacks on the unbelievers‚Ä¶it all speaks of cultism as much as any other movement. It amazes me how Trump supporters mirror Obama‚Äôs supporters.But, then, you will reread your post and explain away the incongruities anyway.The lack of cognitive dissonance is another sign of a true-believer. Those who are in cults never realize that they are in a cult.

            I don‚Äôt recall a single commenter around here being enthusiastic of Republican Presidential candidates going back several elections, but given Novnmber they generally favor stupid over evil. That is what separates Democratic and Republican voters. This is what you call mindless support? Trump is highly valued for one thing, and that is revealing all the Republican candidates and politicians to be punks. There is a value in that.

            If you were doing construction business in New York City, who would you give political contributions to? Would you give it to out of power Repubs or would you give it to the Dems controlling the unions and the permits? The attacks from the unbelievers are coming from the #NeverTrumps. They seem to think, like the EU, that we should do away with elections and have an elite pick our candidates.

            If nothing else, the BIG difference is that Trump is a known quantity.  Obozo came out of nowhere and his bonfides where hidden from everyone.  Well, the media didn‚Äôt work very hard to find anything and fricking lawyers protected his ‚Äúrights‚Äù to keep everything confidential.  So you tell me who the cultists were?And today, we have Hillary.  Yes, Hillary who asks for his tax filings to be released to the public but will not release content of speeches she was paid to make.  Ummm?  So many things to investigate, so many incriminating things simply over looked.  If I, a private citizen did only one thing, not even approaching the likes of stealing something from the WH, I would be a jail for an awfully long time and my life destroyed.Used to be the voting decision was summarized as ‚Äúa choice between the lesser of two evils.‚Äù  Well, in the case of Hillary, that is no choice at all.  My vote is for Trump because I am simply willing to give him the ‚Äúbenefit of the doubt.‚Äù  She is a proven criminal and incompetent politician who has garners titles but accomplished nothing positive.  She has only left death and destruction in her wake.  And it is a very large wake!

            Haven‚Äôt been reading this site long but certainly don‚Äôt see the Trump love you discern.  As for me, I probably won‚Äôt vote for either Party, since in reality they are two side of the same coin, but I can say that the majority of people supporting Trump are doing so because of who he is NOT.  The more he is reviled and castigated by the pedigreed and titled the more solid his support among the peasantry becomes.  I‚Äôve talked to some folks that don‚Äôt have a problem with Iran having a couple of nukes knowing that, being bereft of imagination, the Mullahs would almost certainly waste them on D.C.; in one stroke annihilating their besties and freeing the rest of us from the onerous civic duty of searching out suitable lamp posts.  If being opposed to unaccountable and insatiable lust to power is being a True Believer, though I don‚Äôt recall Hoffer describing it that way, then so be it.
