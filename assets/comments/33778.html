        These days, the music business is all inside baseball. Taylor Swift’s father managed a hedge fund, she was a millionaire before she opened her mouth to sing note one. Britany Spears started as a Mousekateer for Disney. Billie Elish came from a Hollywood family. The A&amp;R people no longer haunt the clubs scouting for talent, because they now grow their own.The days of 4 kids from a Liverpool slum or a truck driver from Mississippi walking into a recording studio and changing the world are long gone. It’s become like being a funeral director. If you grandfather isn’t one, you won’t be either.

            A current star who looks like she’s moving into Swift-like popularity, Sabrina Carpenter, started as a child actress on some show on the Disney Channel.

                    In all seriousness, Karen Carpenter had one of the very most beautiful Contralto voices in all of 21st Century music.
The internet seemed to think she could go a full three octaves.
What a beautiful beautiful voice she had.
What a terribly tragic life she lived.

                        She was a kick ass drummer as well:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVBtjaHxR7Y
She’s in Buddy Rich territory.
I don’t usually don’t emotionally connect with female singers, but she is one of the few exceptions. I love the Carpenters, I don’t care what anyone says.
I even like their psychedelia:  they covered “Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft.”

                        I gotta be in the mood for it, but I do like them occasionally.  I like their cover of Jambalaya.  They “Carpenterized” the crap out of it,  but it’s still pretty good.  That’s the bad part about the Carpenters…they had a sound that they liked and stuck with.  Even the song with the guitar solo had that typical Carpenters sound.Richard has re-recorded a bunch of their music with an orchestra (Royal Philharmonic) and Karen’s original vocal tracks.  Worth checking out if you’re a fan.  The album is on youtube, but the sound quality is not very good, like it was captured too hot.

                Many such cases. The mouse-to-masses pipeline includes Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Hilary Duff, Miley Cyrus, Raven Simone, the Jonas Brothers, Dylan Sprouse, Demi Lovato, and now that intolerable Zendaya.Nickelodeon has a similar pipeline which foisted Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Nick Cannon, and Kiki Palmer on polite society. There’s some crossover between the two groups.Pop stars are much easier to control when you’ve been training them since kids to be compliant and obedient to the system. As the Good Book says, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.” They’re also used to having zero creative input and instead merely being performance-based actors, so there’s no worry of them going off the reservation. You’re only real struggle in wrangling these folks is managing their usually-substantial drug habits that they’ve developed prior to adulthood.

            I think Country Music may prove to be the exception here. The audience still craves some “authenticity”. Some of the bigger stars – Eric Church, Chris Stapleton, Luke Bryan, Luke Combs et alia, even the sketchy Jelly Roll – seem like regular guys, at least to me.
In pop music, we will live to see AI-generated stars. They are more dependable as investments than Kanye or Diddy lol.

                Country music is as fake as everything else.  Their audience does seem to be more trusting, probably because their communities held higher levels of social trust than other parts of the country.  The old school legit country singers have hated what the industry has become for 30+ years.

                    I always found country music to be the same as rap, over produced and stupid for the most part.  Bluegrass had a revival in the early 2010’s, that is what i was listening to back then.  Not sure if it is still as popular today.

                    Nashville country is awful and has been the last 30+ years. But there are independent country musicians–Sturgill Simpson, Jamie Johnson, etc.–who are worthy of respect. At least their music, unlike the Nashville frauds, sounds traditional and genuine.

Saw him live when he was an unknown in the early 2010’s.  Opening for Devil makes three (great band by the way)  He started playing that and i started paying attention.

                        Yes. Add to that list Chris Knight and if you haven’t checked him out he is highly recommended. Caught him in a small venue–as far as I know he has never played a large one–and it was a bittersweet reminder of how good country once was.

                        Yes. Noah Gundersen as well. Country and other genres have bifurcated. In country there are some people who are making some of the best in the genre and also pushing it forward. Stapleton is fantastic. Then there is the product which is just cliches and stereotypes and utter garbage.The same has happened in things like progressive metal. There is some incredible music and talent out there. However, unlike country that genre presents formidable challenges because of the economics of touring, massive headwinds to band formation … …I think AI will kill of the rest of popular entertainment which is really a product or as South Park pointed out in ’14, everything is an ad. I had a long post giving the inside baseball on this but deleted it. Needless to say, most of pop entertainment is really a vehicle for an advertisement.There will be many who love AI generated entertainment as they do the product. In essence they are no different. The product entertainer is already just a formula being re-instantiated and packaged over and over and over. The production is already digital and heavily reliant on digital production formulas. All AI is is something that can regenerate what humans have done and take parameters to vary it a bit.So you might as well AI generate this product. It is actually more honest.That said, there is some very cool music out there but it is in subgenres that you have to discover for yourself and some of the folks, depending on the genre, may never make money off of it.We could see the rise of the patron. The problem is, the pool of patrons are merchants who have no taste and who love AI and whose value system is non-aesthetic and money measured/based.What may happen though, is that they gain status and distinguish themselves from the wealth-appropriation via the state oligarchs by learning to become patrons. That will take a few decades but you can see that returning to status.One thing is for certain, live performance including painting will become more central to the connoisseur class in order to establish authenticity vs. AI generation. Things will get interesting.

                            I have a friend who works in the music industry down in Nashville. He told me CEO’s and producers who actually like country music check out local, authentic acts in small venues but would never even consider signing the performers, no matter how good. That’s insane.

                            Live music played by living breathing musicians will always have a niche following. Especially perhaps if they play original material rather than covers that people have heard a million times. Unless lightning strikes or they “sell out” none of the musicians will ever get rich. Nevertheless perhaps if they’re doing it as a side gig some of them don’t want to get rich.

                    There are some real musicians, such as Chris Stapleton, whose guitar work and voice are amazing. Hard to believe that he started out writing songs for other folks when he has a such an amazing voice.
There are other acts, such as Midland, that recall the glory days of real country. But the vast majority of them are like the pop music, this time churned out by the Nashville system.

                                Copacabana will outlive us all.
We played a road trip game with my kids called Hey Siri.  “Hey Siri, play Black Water by the Doobie Brothers.”
We’d go around the car and the only rules were no interrupting someone else’s song, and no mocking other people’s favorite music.
So my wife calls up Copacabana one day.  The kids pulled up the lyrics and lost their minds laughing when Lola winds up drunk and insane.
Good is good.

                In my observation Country music has totally been coopted at this point. Most of it sounds like rap with a southern accent. All of the new stars look like they are straight out of central casting with a cowboy hat. Those clowns with tattoo’s all over their faces are “country”? nah. Those guys were getting buggered by David Geffen when they were teenagers.

                It’s at least as formulaic and astroturfed as any other form of popular music today. Nashville has been a fake Southern city since modern memory and it’s fitting that it’s the capitol of Country Music. They’ve been sneaking a lot of rap elements into country of late (something that nobody requested) and have been busily ramming this down everybody’s throats. There are some genuine performers, but the “image” of lifted pick-up trucks, hunting, and bailing hay is at least as much of an affectation as noted homos in rap like Usher surrounding themselves with scantily-clad women. It’s an image they have to sell to keep people from realizing how hollow and manufactured everything is.

                I’m surprised there aren’t already AI pop stars. Maybe there are and I just haven’t found one?
I mean, there are several decent examples of AI generated pop songs.
There are also several AI chatbots that use anime avatars of young women to stream.
Why not combine the two?

                    Chatbot lyricists are common, numerically.Spotify has a billion hours of bulk-generated fake music on it, trying to worm its way into algorithmic favor. Occasionally it makes it, and an Indian gets a new Tesla.Some famous songwriters use chatbots, and some of the more professional (in the worst sense) producer/executives in pop—country, specifically—have taken tocorrectingtheir real songwriters with “AI.”That’s an update to corporate tradition. The company always has to stick its dick in the soup. Corporate does almost nothing, so it demands credit for almost everything. Instructions from “AI,” like executive suggestions before them (but more so), areobjective—compared to you, employee #9570 who thinks he’s anartist.You are obsolete.Management of course is not, though it brags of the bot having taken its place. Its job is to defend the bot. Soon all management will consist entirely of this.

                        There’s even a cottage industry in recording with singers sometimes long dead ones. Of course that’s nothing new, but decades ago you had to have access to the multitrack tapes. Nowadays with technology you can run on a powerful pc, you can create “stems,” effectively demultiplexing the multitracking old recordings, apparently even ones that exist only in mono. For example Louis Armstrong’s “St James Infirmary” was recorded in 1928. I was kind of startled to hear him singing in apparent perfection to a backing Jazz orchestra that could have been completely electronic for all I know.

                Zach Top is out there making some of the finest country music since the 90s. We cover a couple of his songs in my band. Other bands I’ve been digging over the past couple of years are Silverada (formerly Mike &amp; The Moonpies), 49 Winchester and Jesse Daniel. There’s a ton of great music out there if you take the time to look for it.

                New Country can actually fill an auditorium.  Few pop or rock acts under 50 years old can do that.
Every country concert I’ve been to, they do a rock song or 2 and everyone loves it.  If rock acts were still promoted, those guys would be going for it.

                its interesting how the “that’s not real country” argument is nothing new. Like Alan Jackson has whined about how real country doesn’t get played anymore but don’t forget that in the early 60s – a lot of people felt Patsy Cline or Jim Reeves wasn’t real country either.
Maybe the real difference is that Cline and Reeves were actually talented and the current stars aren’t

It is like one of the best books i read on rome and its fall (written by a soviet of all people).  When addressing the question of where the good men had gone and why they didn’t stop the corruption of the republic and empire, he pointed out that the system did not select those types anymore.  It’s all fake and gay.

            There was always a huge degree of fakeness like that to pop music, which was always one of the criticisms.  The issue nowadays is that there isn’t anything else, there just isn’t enough cultural cohesion anymore for music acts to grow organically.

            I noticed this when the models of the 1980s and 1990s – think Tyra Banks, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, etc. – aged out of the business and were replaced by their children. The days when a talent agent would spot a beautiful woman walking down the street in Prague and turned her into a global name died long ago. But it almost feels like an inevitability when I can go on Instagram and see a functionally limitless number of beautiful women. How does one even sort that? Easier just to go to the people you know have good genes and know the business.When literally every single 12 year old on the planet can record themselves singing or playing an instrument and post it online and have access to tools that are, if not as good as the professional ones, almost as good, the “taste makers” need a way to sift through and they just go the old fashioned route of nepotism and connections.

                    Well, one of the core issues is that the market value of talent is not high. It never has been, really. Tons of people are talented. Whenever I am in Nashville or Austin I am astounded at the musical talents there, but ultimately they are playing in a bar at 3pm on a Wednesday for tips. As mentioned in this thread, the pipeline that used to sift out bands for larger consumption (local radio, A&amp;R, etc.) has largely broken down, but even when it was there, what made band X hit and band Y miss is impossible to define. But since that pipeline has broken down, it’s not like recomrd companies are going to hop on YouTube and watch 12,000 videos of talented artists playing music. They’ll go to what they know, and that is the old school connections.

                All celebrity culture must die.  In the past, a handful of women become supermodels as chosen by those with THE POWER.  Today, any girl can slut herself up all over the internet.
Either way, it is IDOLATRY and it ALL MUST END!

That’s probably for the best. The elites can whore out their daughters. Let the homegrown beauties stay at home.

            There’s a meme about this. It goes “Never ask a woman her age, a man his salary, or an ‘Indie pop star’ why their parents names are blue on their Wikipedia page.” This alludes to the fact that almost all “local talent-turned world-famous” musicians had parents that were connected and important of their own right enough to warrant their own Wikipedia pages, which generated a hyperlink on the star’s page. Whether it’s simple nepotism or the music industry wanting to deal with people who are more easily controlled than a pack of dirt-people who found themselves in the spotlight is anybody’s guess.

            About a decade ago, I was helping a child learn to play a musical instrument in the band, and the Middle Skrewl Band Director wanted the kids to choose a song and play that song [solo, in front of the entire band] for their Quarterly grades in the Band Class.So I went back through a decade or more of Billboard Top 40 charts, trying to find something reasonably “contemporary” for the child to play at the end-of-Quarter “recital”.My God, theTop 40 chartscomprised just dreck upon dreck upon dreck.Horrible cacophonous sheer 120dB White Noise [with maybe some Pink Noise thrown in to, make absolutely certain that your ears would go literally DEAF].Finally, after days and days and days of the cacophony of it all, I stumbled upon ONE AND ONLY ONE song which had a discernible melody and understandable lyric.That song was called, “Hey There Delilah”, written by Tom Higgenson, for the Plain White T’s, and it peaked at #1, in July 2007.“Hey There Delilah”https://tinyurl.com/yab5jmm9Since then, I have never again heard another 21st Century song, with a discernible melody and understandable lyrics.====================Now here’s the kicker: There was an ackshual flesh-n-blood female human being, named Delilah DiCrescenzo, who served as the muse of Tom Higgenson.But to the best of my knowledge, she never even bothered to sleep with him.Apparently she just wrote off his passion as nothing more than merely Beta Thirst.Moral of the Story being that I don’t have any earthly idea what the Moral of the Story is, other than thatNo Good Dead Goes Unpunished, and God only knows what 21st Century Women now consider to be “Alpha”.Because apparently even writing a Billboard #1 single can’t get a fellow an “Alpha” status amongst these cray cray 21st Century Cluster-B bishes.God only knows what the hell they’re looking for in a Bro.I guess Tom Higgenson needed to go purchase a Glock, and bust some caps in a few kneegr0wz, in order to get laid ?!?!?

            It wouldn’t surprise me if Swift, Spears, Elish, and quite a few others were also being “run” by the CIA or other TLAs. What better way to make sure the young people, particularly the easily manipulated girls, stay good and brainwashed. Then you’ve got people like Diddy, who most of us just thought was another dumb black rapper, who was apparently running his own little Epstein island operation. Did he have some help from the deep state? There’s a definite smell of deep state sulfur on these recent pop stars to me.

                True detective season 2 was generally awful, but one part sticks out in my memory.  A scene where they go to a party and all these eastern European girls are being fed drugs and prostituted out to rich fat slobs.  Somebody was trying to be slightly truthful, because its ok to tell about it in movies and tv, cause they aren’t real 😉

                Or think of Weinstein, Women were greedy enough to give that ugly fuck sex to get roles.  He didn’t put a gun to their head and force them, he made a trade.  They’re shitty people for accepting that trade, but you see people doing just as shitty stuff at all corporate levels to get ahead.  They weren’t “victims” they were equally shitty people.   Our tolerance will be our undoing.

        worth mentioning is the practice of lip synching supposedly live performances, and having all or some of the backing music being recorded.  and people are paying hundreds of dollars a seat for this slop.
a much better value, IMO, is going to see tribute bands.  some of them are really decent musicians, able to recreate the live shows of the original band.

            I was offered a free ticket to the rolling stones a while back, I like the band, their best songs are close to perfect imo, but I turned it down because its a stadium gig. Once a band starts playing stadiums it’s kind of pointless. Unless it’s a band like Rammstein which does work on a large scale. I find the Taylor Swift BS funny, I don’t know any of her “music” so I can’t comment on it from that angle, I don’t think her fans actually like music, there is something else at play, they need to be part of something

                That’s the real thing. I actually kinda sorta “follow” Taylor Swift, because she / her team have figured out how to be, for lack of a better term, aGesamtkunstwerk,a Wagnerian “total art work” (but fake and gay, obviously).Her biggest fans by far are at the far end of “the demo” — in their late 40s, as opposed to their mid-teens. I don’t know if they actually listen to her songs; the songs seem to be an entry point for the entire soap opera that is The Taylor Swift Experience. She’s like a walking, talking soap opera — the NFL is rigging games just to get her more screen time, because the NFL is desperately chasing the AWFL dollar like everyone else. She’s somehow able to keep everyone talking about her even when she’s not releasing songs, which she rarely even does anymore. I think her latest tour was basically “the greatest hits,” and it had a theatrical release movie, some other kind of streaming thing, and a whole bunch more.She sees The Matrix when it comes to self-publicity. Her fans — 40 year old wine moms — take her more seriously than normal people takeanything. The only person that comes close in terms of self-promotion is Trump. It’s fascinating, in a sick way — she obviously understands something about PoMo life that I wish I could figure out.

Others have talked about the differences in male and female cultural likes.  Generally stated, males want someone they can relate with, females want to insert themselves or believe they’re the person in the book, movie, or whatever.

                    Depends on the kind of act. AC/DC was good at the Met Center in Minneapolis in the late ’80s. But anymore, musicians don’t trust their sound engineers. They use pedals to saturate and reverb the snot out of the signal, and unless the engineer has enough clout to demand an additional clean signal to mix with,  it all comes out mushy at best. Adding reverb to natural reverb is almost always a disaster. Maybe it sounds good from the monitors, but the linear arrays come out shit.

            Saw Carl Palmer &amp; “An evening with Emerson Lake and Palmer” a few weeks ago. Despite the fact that Lake died several years ago, Palmer found a singer who does their music justice. It was a great show!

                Doesn’t Carl Palmer also have a guitarist playing the keyboard parts of the late, great Keith Emerson?
My first concert ever as a teenager was ELP playing Soldier Field in the “Super Bowl of Rock” with a 70 piece orchestra. They dropped the orchestra after several shows because it was extremely expensive.
ELP were an ambitious band pushing the boundaries, blending rock and classical with virtuoso musicianship and were very successful. Record companies would give some leeway on bands doing different, original things back then.

                    Parts of those pieces, yes. Although I’m not sure I would classify it as a guitar, as it made sounds that are identical to a keyboard. Until that show, I had never seen it before and I’m not sure what it is.

The Village, for example, spawned both the folk (pre-rock) scene and the LGBTQ scene.  Meaning, a common factor at work.

                The Druids maintained power via popular music … musicians and songwriters. Those directed the populace.
Music is powerful, penetrative, and addictive, after all it’s named after extra-normal experience, the spiritual muses or inspirers of song. Most great song comes from outside the artist. The artist gets in the way of the wave then transcribes and records it.
Popular music certainly led Western culture in the Sixties, and to lesser (but still potent) effect in the Fifties. Very Druidic stuff. I used to play and sing and I know what song can do to people.

                    Christian priests, too, maintained power through music. Dangerous inventions such as batteries, the cassette tape player, and microspeakers (for headphones) have played a significant role in the priests’ downfall. Down went one entangling sensualist system; up arose another.The papists, seeking to regain their footing, adopted some of the new technologies and techniques for their services. Thus was the electronic drum machine introduced into their music. Really. One was used at my mother’s church. I can still hear it, and even now the memory of that experience tempts me to burst out laughing. Some of the protesters’ services are even more ridiculous with their loud, obnoxious bands.

        The Boomer rock bands are either on their way out of the door to the nursing home or are already in the cemetery and the next few years will see the last of them.The rise of grunge in the 1990s when I was in high school was the last time that music was a dominant part of the culture. Only one of those bands from that era, Pearl Jam, is still touring and making albums, with the rest claimed by heroin overdoses.Ben Folds (an awful leftist goon) did a good job skewering the love of black “gangsta” rap by white suburban kids, which was the end of the band as a musical force.I’m rockin’ the suburbsJust like Michael Jackson didI’m rockin’ the suburbsExcept that he was talentedI’m rockin’ the suburbsI take the checks and face the factsThat some producer with computers fixes all my shitty tracksMusic is so atomized now. YouTube has technically amazing guitar players that have ever existed in history and would blow the previous gold standard, Eddie Van Halen, into the weeds, but none of them will make any kind of living off their art.

            For as long as I can recall even the biggest acts made all their money by touring.  It doesn’t help an act to have 50,000 fans on YouTube if they’re spread all over the planet and can’t sustain a tour.

                I think that has only been true since about 1990 or so (when coincidentally ticket prices suddenly did a big jump). Before that, it used to be that acts (and/or their record labels) made the majority of their money from record sales, and frequently took a loss on touring in order to promote more record sales. It was around 1990 when this started to flip. Nowadays you make all your money playing live and practically nothing on “record” sales (unless you’re Taylor Swift). And you put out “records” just so people will pay to come to your live shows. Whereas before, you did live shows just so people would buy your records.

                    That’s spot-on right, it was a 180 degree flip.Napster and streaming did it for the record sales, but it was greedy Michael Jackson in 1984 who did it for ticket prices withThriller.
﻿He jacked up ticket prices to$40for his shows, when they were still $9 for such monster bands as the Police, Journey, and Ozzie.

                    “And you put out “records” just so people will pay to come to your live shows.”This is the “Asian” model.  I found out about this 30 year ago.  We had an Asian student with a large amount of pop music on one of our systems.  Those were the days of automated “take down” notices and threats of suit for copyright infringement.  I called him into the office and boy did I get a lesson.  Seems all his music was on the net for *free* download. It was not “pirated”.  Asian pop stars owned their music and put it out for free in the hopes of building an audience for concerts, where the money was.  Private companies still made their money on the commercial distribution of records and CD’s as usual, but they never signed artists to contracts that enslaved the artists by controlling/owning their music.

                    The fact that the revenue flip occured around 1990 makes complete sense.Dual compact cassette tape decks were getting really, really good in terms of sound quality. Heck, even compact cassette tape decks in cars could skip tracks or play on a loop.In 1992, two digital mediums with vastly improved sound quality were introduced. Those were Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) and MiniDisc (MD). I actually owned several MD units and they were quite good. MDs were far more rugged than CDs, making them very suitable for portable use.In terms of fidelity, the real bomb dropped in 1997 when CD-RW (re-writable CDs) dropped on the market.

                Back in the 2000s, one of my girlfriends met the drummer for a popular band that had cracked the top 10 in the Billboard 200 a couple of times. He revealed that the record company paid salaries (his was about $250k a year) with a few incentives for selling out gigs and a small percentage of royalties for record sales. They were employees performing tasks and receiving bonuses rather than artists, essentially.

I guess he got PO’d with Spotify over their politics and told them to smarten up or he’d pull his music away from them – was it a flap about the environment or one of his shitlib political hot buttons? I can’t remember… but the guys just laughed at him and said “Okay, Boomer…”

                Neil got all bent out of shape because Spotify was hosting Joe Rogan who had guests questioning the Covid faux vax.
He’s touring with a new band this summer.
But in general the death of rock music is greatly exaggerated. There are tons of bands out there playing creative music out there performing in all sorts of venues, from small clubs through theaters to amphitheaters and arenas.

                    Queen playing at a bar is not Queen. If you can’tbecome Queen—if no one will ever accuse your concerts of recreating the Nuremberg rallies—rock is in fact dead.
The music is only part of the thing. Without the possibility of total spectacle, without aplausible desireto overwhelm a great crowd, it’s something else.
I prefer the small stuff, but it’s not “rock,” except in an attenuated genealogical sense. Rock is the wolf—at its best, the werewolf. What we do now, however interesting it is tous, is a toy poodle.

            Rock -&gt; Hair Metal -&gt; Grunge -&gt; Hip Hop
An interesting conspiracy theory is that each of these transformations was worse for white men. White men were masculine in rock, even if they had long hair. Hair metal made the white men more effeminate but was still confident and cocky. Grunge reduced white men to suicidal, depressed, whining drug addicts. Hip Hop got rid of white men altogether.
Who runs the record and media companies?
The only link in the conspiratorial chain that I absolutely believe in was that replacing grunge with hip hop was pushed from the top down.

        Another factor is the decline of church music, reducing everybody’s sense of quality. The Protestants started it, with their horrible “Christian Rock,” which somebody said isn’t Christian and isn’t rock. Then Catholics followed after ditching the Latin Mass in 1969. There’s actually an Elvis movie about that, also from 1969, “Change of Habit,” starring Mary Tyler Moore as a with-it nun who leaves the convent, ditches her habit and goes to work as a social worker in the ghetto and gets romanced by the King and his songs before middle-age-spread and banana sandwiches bloated him.

As to Elvis…So there was this girl in a small college; all cowgirl, all Nevada.It was “Triple Thursday”, three songs in a row, on the radio.
Spooning, had gotten to third base, everything off but the panties.Those panties were glued on, I swear. Waited, and waited, andwaited…
Then, Elvis came on, a triple set…and those panties disappeared, like magic.

            Not sure why you got a downvote, but from my exp. that is where people generally got their first exp. being involved in music.  Sunday at a church, at least when i was a kid in the late 80’s early 90’s.  Hardly anyone goes to church anymore so i could see the correlation.

            “Then Catholics followed after ditching the Latin Mass in 1969.”The Latin Mass in 1969 had a lot of contemporary music, because most of them were low Masses. I will grant that many contemporary hymns from the early 20th century are not bad. But they are not Gregorian chant, which is has not been universally popular for a very long time.The tiny, and probably overproduced, older liturgies of today didn’t really happen in the early 20th century. If I want to find real people singing real songs that mean something to them today, I just need to go a regular parish.Yes, pop culture music stinks, but mostly because it’s dead and conformist. Folk and church music are not always the high culture music, aka good and that’s fine.““Change of Habit,” starring Mary Tyler Moore as a with-it nun who leaves the convent, ditches her habit and goes to work as a social worker in the ghetto and gets romanced by the King and his songs before middle-age-spread and banana sandwiches bloated him.”The whole plot, which appears to have mimicked her life, suggests that our nun was not particularly serious. That formality of a religious life in an unintellible language didn’t grow any significant faith . Pretty can be just as empty as ugly. Give me some “On Eagle’s Wings” and people at least semi-serious about the faith any day of the week. Running with Elvis and pretending to care about poor people is hardly a happy ending.

                But they are not Gregorian chant, which is has not been universally popular for a very long time.
That can only be considered as a mark in its favour LOL.
That formality of a religious life in an unintellible language didn’t grow any significant faith
That’s the Hollywood take on religion for you.

        I never would have dreamed that bands who haven’t released new music in over 30 years would be so popular today.  Nirvana, the Police, Queen and the Beatles get from about 30 to 50 million listens per month on Spotify.  The Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd are also very popular.  Clearly that kind of music has appeal. So where are the new bands?

            It’s weird, but back when I was teaching college kids I assumed they were wearing their Nirvana etc. t-shirts ironically. But they weren’t. I remember having a serious discussion with a kid in my office hours about Guns ‘n’ Roses. It was surreal — first that a kid half my age was listening to this stuff, and second that he was talking about it with an old geezer like me. Not in the “humoring the old man with the grade book” way, but fan to fan. Kids These Days are risk-averse in a way we can’t really grok, so I suppose it makes sense. Why take a risk on new stuff when Pink Floyd’s entire catalog is there, remastered?

                Maybe it’s simply a case of merit, like beauty and truth, eventually willing out. As long as superior music is readily available, the sentient segment of the population will prefer it to postmodern, corporate pap. That’s the optimistic take, anyway.

                And what genuinely new music can you make when you’ve got 75+ years of music recordings easily available?There’s a short story, I can’t recall its name, about a world that has enacted infinite copyright. Every single artistic work ever created is copyrighted forever, with the rights passing from one set of heirs, to the next, to the next. The two main characters are locked in a debate about whether there’s a dire need to abolish infinite copyright to allow for artists to do something, anything without running afoul of something previously copyrighted.The key line is, and forgive me if I don’t get the wording exactly right is, there are only so many musical notes in so many pitches played on so many instruments that can be arranged in so many ways to be pleasing to the human ear. No matter how high the number may be,it is not infinite. Therefore, infinite copyright inevitably leads to total exhaustion of the available music space. Same principle for writing, motion pictures, etc.We may not yet have exhausted the full set of new music available, but it’s clear we’re out in the fringes of what’s left. All the “easy pickings” have already been picked.

            Part of it is the spread of technology. One of the reasons Hollywood is extremely reluctant to take a chance on new IPs is that they want the name recognition of movies that came out when there were much fewer movies, both in the archives and actively being premiered every year. It’s the same thing for music. We’ve got an overabundance of music and artists and everyone is struggling to become a breakout hit. With bandcamp, youtube, and other formats, almost anybody can throw their music out to the masses. The sheer volume of material makes it tougher to attain actual significance. Radio, movies, TV, and other media act as curators and promote artists already consensus-selected by the music industry as the stars. This is largely due to the safe nature of investment in pop and how easily controlled these stars are. Their albums don’t bomb. Their shows get consistent attendance. They say all of the right things to not alienate their consumers.There aren’t really any “scenes” for bands to come up in these days because younger generations (including mine) are “eternally online” and don’t really congregate in real spaces. Kids don’t really pick up instruments anymore because passive consumption. A lot of the music is electronic anyways, so you use your computer to make music like you use it for everything else. And even if some kids defied the odds, picked up instruments, and learned to play in a style that resembled all of the great rock from ages past, they’d be lampooned as derivative and copycats. Tribute bands get around this by making it readily apparent that they’re copycats and thus stealing the thunder of critics. There were a few bands that tried to resurrect the classic rock aesthetic to various degrees of success including Wolfmother, Heaven’s Basement, Buckcherry, and even Nickelback, but they were all critically lampooned and almost none of them had any staying power beyond a decade, shorter for most of them. Emo bands had more clout and maintained a following for longer, ironically.

            As I tell my kids, “If you’ve never heard it before, it’s new to YOU.  That’s what counts.”
That music was good because it was good.  Nothing more.  My 19 year old sent me a playlist recently.  It had several new bands (very good) I didn’t know, but also Don’t Follow (Alice in Chains) and Catfish Blues (Hendrix).
Years ago, in the early days of iTunes I uploaded my entire 600 album CD collection.  And I grew my collection vastly from there.  My kids have access to my entire library which leads them to new discoveries.
Good is good.

        I’ve been rebelling against Top 40 pop music since I was a teenager.  Favorite songs were played to death; Freebird! is a well-worn joke.  New bands would have big debut albums and once they got popular, they would go Strictly Commercial.I used to go to the big shows, but I’ve come to hate crowds.  Give me some no-name band playing greasy blues at the local dive bar.

                About 7 years ago I saw Carl Palmer of ELP do a show with a couple of sidekicks, playing instrumental versions of old ELP songs (which were mostly instrumental to begin with), and to my mild surprise it was worth every penny. Best drummer I have ever seen in person, hands down. But there was no smoking, weed, or bell bottoms. Just a bunch of boomers who probably used to.

        I wonder if the biggest live draws in the next 20 years won’t be “tribute” bands. The metro near me has been advertising its big show of the summer, which is basically the Alternative Also-Rans of 1994. Which means those guys are at least in their fifties, if not sixties. The bands doing Vegas “residencies” — which very few can afford to see anyway — are pushing 70, e.g. U2. The Cure recently did a tour, I heard, and Robert Smith — who again is 65 years old — tried to get “cheap” seats at like $30 a pop; Ticketmaster just laughed at him. The point is, you can’t afford to see those guys now, and it won’t be more than a few years before youcan’tsee these guys….…but you can see the “tribute” version. I’m not sure how it works out with copyright, but Chuck Klosterman (yeah, I know) had an amusing article where he followed a Guns ‘n’ Roses tribute band around for a while. They outdrew Dokken, the real act, by some huge number when both played the same college town. That’s the ultimate in predictability, right there — if they figure out how to successfully financialize it, look for “U3” and “Puns and Roses” and whatnot to be the big concert draws of the future.

                That’s what I mean. At this point, who would you rather see: Maybe one or two of the original lineup of [insert 70s, 80s, or 90s act], plus whatever hired guns have replaced the others, and everyone’s just going through the motions; or a “tribute” band where everybody is working their asses off to make sure it looks, sounds, and feels exactly like what Kiss would’ve sounded like on their very best night back in 1978? The real Gene Simmons would break a hip, but the “tribute” guy can rock as hard as he needs to.One of the Alt All Stars of 1994 is the Gin Blossoms, who were briefly popular in the 1990s and probably would’ve had a much bigger career, except that their lead singer / main songwriter committed suicide. You reallycan’tsee “the Gin Blossoms” in any meaningful sense — they’re basically a tribute actto themselvesat this point.

                    Good points. Teens of my generation loved Sublime. I’ve found that Sublime tribute bands are better than the actual Sublime which survived after Bradley’s death. I refuse to watch my beloved bands in their late middle age as they still perform, like The Pixies. I prefer them frozen in time as when I first encountered them.

                    I wonder if the next step would be to make it an “immersive experience” to truly make it whatever year said band is representing. Like you build a club where you can’t get in unless you meet the dress code, which is literally “dress like it is 1988”. You have to check your phone at the door so the show isn’t ruined by a sea of glowing handheld screens. The club is decorated with vintage 20th century stuff, so you leave Clown World behind for an hour. And I can’t imagine what the women would do if they had to play 80s dress up- it would spawn a whole industry of girls asking Grandma how to use Aqua Net.

                        Good golly yes. That is a fabulous idea; I had an extremely rich friend who came across, and bought, a speakeasy beneath Cincinnati. It had been sealed since Prohibition, everything in it was original. Just imagine the possibilities.
Jeez, that picture. I’m sending it to the granddaughters.Perms were in, MTV was on, Reagan was President, and it wasglorious.
The smell of Aqua Net was everywhere!  Farah Fawcett should be a minor deity for that reason alone.And leggings. What the heck happened to leggings?

                            Send them this, which was a tribute to the American girl circa 1989. The footage is literally of random girls at Ratt concerts, not models to get a sense of fashion, hair and makeup. It’s like a time capsule.

                                That’s an idea with legs. If I knew anything about the club business, I’d start that right now. You’d make millions. But you’d have to have a photographer there somewhere, because they HAVE TO take selfies with their cosplay. That would be pretty easy though — have them pay for pics, and give them a QR code or something so that when they leave your club, they can log on and download them. Damn… I wish I had some knowledge about the club biz, and some seed capital.

                    I would never go see a tribute band.  I’ve seen George Jones with his wrist broken, and Emmylou Harris with her voice shot. That’s the real deal, even though the performances were lacking.  I cherish the memories.
Who ever bragged that they shook hands with an Elvis Impersonator?

If health permitted, I could busk off of Sixties and Seventies covers throughout Latin America.  Just set up where the gringos congregate, beach towns are especially juicy.  There’s always a bar or restaurant that’ll employ me.

            As I mentioned below, small venues in music-oriented cities like Nashville, Austin, LA, etc., are having something of a renaissance and feature new, obscure and often excellent bands. The house band, as it is, though, inevitably will be a tribute band. Tickets are cheap and these places tend to be packed to the rafters with a disproportionate number of musicians in the audience. As Z mentioned, the industry in these cities is corporate slop and ignores the local hot bands, which wasn’t the case very long ago. We can hope that changes but until it happens the tribute band will be needed as an initial draw, an aural fly in amber.

I couldn’t.  Can’t bear the thought.  The Greatest Armenian, Steve Perry, is a local son, and I’ve chatted with the band members.  Just working tradesmen, really, great joes.

                I’d probably stick with the original if they were reliable. But I passed on so many bands back in college because it was the early 90s — the worst pop cultural decade in human history — and all the bands back then were real dice throws. You pay $50 or $75 to see GNR, and half the time they melt your face off…. but the other half they show up two hours late, Axl meanders through three songs before yelling at the crowd and leaving, while none of the other guys even notice because they’re on the nod. I just couldn’t risk blowing most of a semester’s entertainment budget on a 50/50 bet.

                    Same here. I wanted to see Gunners in Montreal August 1992 even if it meant having to suffer through some metallica. But Axl didn’t like the reception he got from the crowd (there may have been lingering bitterness from ’87 when they opened for the Cult and were booed), he stormed off, and the crowd busted up Olympic Stadium. Oh yeah, Hetfield caught fire too from the pyrotechnics, iirc.

        I have a notion that the death of boomers and boomer bands is going to put a real crimp in the live music business. They can’t manufacture enough Taylor Swifts to fill all the concert halls that need to be filled, to give the ticket resellers something to sell, to give the promoters something to promote. How many non instrument playing non singing acts will people be willing to pay big bucks to go see in person? Obviously more than I ever would have thought. But still not enough.I remember as a kid watching Buck Rogers in the 25th Century on TV (the one with Gil Gerard and Erin Gray), and folks were dancing to computer generated music. “Like that’ll ever happen” I said to myself.

            Above and Beyond sold out House of Blues when they came trough town, and for those unfamiliar with the act, their songs are pretty good but it’s and EDM act, so no live music is involved (so far as I know, I’m too old to go to EDM shows).

                    Well the problem for me is those shows are known to go to like 1am or crap like that.  I recall a Paul van Dyk show that *started* at 11pm, which is about the time I can no longer resist the urge to nod off.  One of the A&amp;B guys lightly complained about it at one point, comparing it to working a third shift job.

            Looking at the top 20 tours of 2024, it looks like the generational changeover is happening. It’s not dominated with boomers like it was a few years ago, a lot of Gen X and Millennials in there. I don’t know, people will continue to enjoy live music long into the future.That said, I have long thought that some of these bands would just keep touring forever and replacing members like Theseus’ ship. Like, KISS will be doing tours into 2050 long after all the original members and fans are six feet under. But we still have Queen touring, and Guns and Roses, and Motley Crue, they just keep swapping out people.

        A childhood friend of mine attended the Iron Maiden concert in NYC last November. His very first concert was Iron Maiden in 1985 and he told me the band performed just as well as they did nearly 40 years ago.Obviously, the audience at their “The Future Past” tour was as white as the snow. If Tucker Carlson’s aliens caught a glimpse of it, they’d believe the Earth was entirely white, as long as they steer clear of netflix.

        Generally agree, but small venues in music-oriented cities like Nashville, Austin, LA, Seattle and to a lesser extent NYC are having something of a renaissance and feature bands rather than solo acts. Some excellent rock and country music can be found in these places performed by bands you don’t know. The question is if this can be translated into mass marketing and profit, and for the reasons you cited, that may not be a safe bet. We likely will see the good stuff confined to these corners unless a way around the slop machine is found. It still is nice to know people have a desire, no matter how faint, to interact and enjoy live music.

            Many years ago bands in those cities that gained a local following would eventually get played on a radio station in that particular city.  The radio station had a program director who decided what to play.  Eventually the band’s popularity would spread.  That local program director is gone today and it’s the corporation deciding what music to play.

                Yes. Since these cities had an existing music infrastructure, that drew in talent that would start in small venues and eventually get picked up. The renaissance of these venues may be more or less a cultish thing (like vinyl collection) and now foreclosed by corporate decision-making from spreading to a wider audience. You are spot on that the disappearance of local radio programming has proved a near fatal blow. I notice that in these places the audience is disproportionately musicians. It may prove short-lived and people who live near these cities should take advantage while they can.

                Hell, in the early days of radio, DJs such as Wolfman Jack actually played a huge role in influencing public musical tastes. They chose what to play rather than playing a play list put together by the suits. I suppose the transition from the former to the latter started long ago, probably no later than the mid-seventies.

                    It’s called the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which basically killed local radio. Up until then, you could call your local DJ and request songs. Local bands actually had a chance to get some airplay. Outside of college radio, that doesn’t exist anymore, and I’m not sure it even still exists in college radio.

        Pop music has been corporate-controlled for a long time. This was particularly true of country music in the 1950s and 1960s — the producers actually made Waylon Jennings wear a coat and tie in his younger days, LOL.The phenomenon of pop music “bands” formed by average guys in a garage was largely a Boomer phenomenon and an artifact of the 1960s counterculture. Eventually a lot of these acts went mainstream and made tens of millions, but they all started out as stoned white kids aping Negro blues and thus bypassing the entire corporate/marketing structure.This genre is dying because the Boomers are dying and because it is no longer countercultural, but rather mainstream. The point of countercultural music was to challenge the boundaries of conservative, bourgeois society, and those boundaries have all been long destroyed. Today you can go grocery shopping in a store full of 70-year olds and the muzak they are playing is Queen or AC/DC singing about anal sex.For the most part, I say good riddance. Some of the acts were musical geniuses, some were terrible, but 95% of it was either trite and ephemeral if not completely degenerate and subversive. We went from Elvis to the Sex Pistols in a span of only 20 years. By 1977, the Tubes pretty much had it figured out:Tubes – White Punks On Dope (1977 R0X M1X) – YouTubeI find myself listening to jazz these days, particularly fusion…

                Agree, but the point is that it was all about transcending boundaries. In 1956 Elvis himself was considered outrageous for being a white guy playing sexualized Negro music and thrusting his hips at the girls. Twenty years later, he was a fat, drug addicted Vegas act who was 100% mainstream.

        In the late Sixties and Seventies, bands were everywhere. Garage bands on most suburban streets. Heck my eight-grade class consisted of ten or twelve boys. Four of them started a rock band. In 1965.Aside from novelty songs, songs didn’t get traction unless exceptional and, often, unique. Competition was ferocious. Yes you needed music industry types back then to get the tunes recorded, pressed, and distributed, but the ‘industry’ part was subordinate to the ‘music’ part.The past three or four decades, it’s been corporate swill appealing to a young, female LCD. . . essentially a profitable form of mass-mind conditioning. Langley lurve lurve lurves them some Taylor Swift and Dronic Swifties. The girls PAY to be brainwashed. It’s ‘The View’ for the young.And then there is the ubiquitous (c)rap music.  Three decades of it.  It’s music AA.Brilliance can’t arise from the bottom anymore. It’s all corporate managed, top-down managed. Rock ‘n roll is about NOT being managed; my music is anathema in these times.

        I welcome the decline of pop and corp-rock. It was always crap. Even actually-good big acts like Pink Floyd and Metallica who claimed to be anti-corporate were actually corporate. The coming reign of the atomized micro-acts is better for music. They can never be accused of selling out or whoring themselves for (((producers))). You just need to find a catchy genre, and start mining it. This is always better than being spoonfed goysound by HOT HITZ 101.

        Trump won the young male vote even the non white one. I wonder what impact the rightward shift in young men combined with their increasingly being outcasts thanks to the gynocracy and H1Bs will have on music and other art forms.
Maybe nothing. I know a few teenage males and their whole personal life is built around playing games.
Maybe games (playing them and making them) fill that urge forming a band and listening to them used to fill.

Gaming has changed too, especially in the multiplayer segment. The divide between young ‘uns and geezers is present as well.Young zoomer gamers are more antisocial and it’s often hard forming a group with them.Indie-game development satisfies a personal creative urge and with modern tools it’s much easier to make one on your own. That’s one field where autistic guys can flourish.

        Here I am, longing for the return of Disco!Sadly, most modern music which ever makes it onto the radio is utter crap.  Despite my appreciation of Disco, I’d be the first to admit there is some terrible Disco, but it’s probably all better than popular music now.I also started listening to older country music and classical music.  I even developed an appreciation for Hank Williams!  I used to hate country, especially Hank Williams.

        Hmpffffff.I never would have noticed had you not pointed this all out. My question is… is this really a bad thing…?I’m asking because I don’t know – not trying to be a dink or anything… but … ugggghhh. The boy bands? Rap? PBBFFFFT! I turned the TVANDthe radio off decades ago.The bands were bad enough, but the programmers and DJ’s? The morning shows on a lot of the local stations just pissed me off in the morning. They’d do “banter” in the morn… which devolved into a bunch of fake cheerful idiots that were so stupid and silly… they thought they were entertaining…For awhile I started watching (despite my old curmudgeonly nature) this kid:(2) Time After Time (ukulele cover) – YouTubeShe blew up for awhile on OyTube and the music wasn’t great or anything… but she was just a dumb kid hanging out and playing whatever she wanted and she didn’t sound too bad to my ear… but whadda I know?She suffered exactly what you are talking about. She did great on OyToob but the industry she wanted to break into didn’t exist anymore and she quit a couple years back. There was an endearing honesty and earnestness to this kid that just appealed to me… compared to the manufactured harlots that the mainstream was belting out. I am honestly glad she failed because I’d hate to see what Big Music and bid money would have done to her.Perhaps this is a GOOD thing, in a roundabout way?

        We are seeing a decline in the admiration and influence of traditional entertainers.  Even women seem less enamored with the entertainment industry than they were 20-30 years ago.  I know very few men who care about it.  One problem is that it some of this is shifting to online influencers.  Most of them are just as dumb and vapid as the people in the entertainment industry. It appears many women especially are more likely to take their advice because that is what a lot of the content is built around. It is like they are carnies 2.0.

        There’s a massive and resurgent audience for stadium rock. Every 90s alt rock, punk and hair metal band that can still shoulder a guitar and stand upright is coming out of retirement.There is big interest in rock music from Gen Z – I was at a stadium rock show a few months ago and half the audited was under 30 and it was packed.The issue is the rock bands of yore did what they did so well there isn’t really much to add to it – all new rock sounds like a throwback to older, better rock. And that stuff s easily available to an audience discovering it for the first time. So as a new rock band you’re up against everything from the Beatles to Zepplin to Nirvana and Linkin Park – tough to make an impact if that’s your competition.

            I’ve said this before here (and elsewhere): “Rock” is a wonderful but fairly limited art form. Wander too far afield from a few basic rhythms and it’s not rock anymore, it becomes something else. Thus, pretty much everything that can be done in the genre had been done by the early 1980s or so.

                I’ve made a similar argument about the “Grunge,” subgenre of rock.
Grunge had extremely strict built-in musical and visual limitations that meant it was never going to last beyond the mid to late-90s.
The only significant grunge band still touring is Pearl Jam, who morphed into a lame imitation of a 70s jam band decades ago.

        Another thing that stands out is the almost complete lack of musical originality. The most successful music is now at least partly recycled. Either as a new version of an old tune or at least using sequences and samples from an old hit. Most of it is trash, but some of it is good enough to evoke nostalgia for the good old times.
All music producers are now using “The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)” by The Timelords.

        I hate NPR and PBS given that they’re little more than mouthpieces for the elites to preach from. However, given the financialization of music, I don’t think anybody would perform Bach, Shakespeare, or other better art from a better time without serious subsidization. Unfortunately, these subsidies get split up among the loonies who engage in avant-garde tripe and insane political rhetoric which is equally mystical and impenetrable to the average slob, albeit less enjoyable.One of the reasons poetry doesn’t exist in our society is that we shifted from Edgar Allen Poe to Sylvia Plath to Maya Angelou and Allen Ginsberg (with very few decent poets between Poe and contemporary “poets). When told that these 4 poets are equally meritorious despite obvious deficiencies in the last 3, society shrugs and dismisses poetry at large rather than learning to appreciate what makes Poe great.Music is a bit more difficult. We still have music, but just like advertising, it’s been engineered with the help of psychology to tickle your ears in a way that prior music just couldn’t. Formulaic application of “hooks” that trigger enjoyment despite banality, use of production to enhance the auditory pleasures of sounds you hear, and the trite use of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus and other overused formats has made all music basically the same. You’ll notice there’s no “dynamics” in modern music. It’s bad for radio and other applications when the music is quieter or louder at some points. Due to the nuclear arms race of designing songs to get stuck in your head, almost all music sounds vaguely similar. There’s only so many ways you can rearrange 12 tones. One guy, “Dr. Luke” (before you ask, yes, the early life section holds no surprises) has written hits for Kelly Clarkson, Pink, Avril Lavigne, Katy Perry, Kesha, and plenty of other “artists.” In reality, there are a small number of writers and almost no artist with clout writes their own music in any meaningful way. This further homogenizes music.Music has a different problem than poetry. While there’s a dearth of poetry in society, there’s an overabundance of music. It is intensely addictive (it’s designed that way) and at the same time unsatisfying. Listening to pop decreases your musical attention span and makes it tougher to focus and enjoy rigorous music. I’m not sure if the genuine fine arts are going to survive the next 50 years, but if they do, it will be because they were subsidized and endowed to continue existing. This is another huge “L” for Libertarians because they can’t articulate an argument why our society should maintain the New York Philharmonic to perform Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos and instead accept that the market has chosen Ariana Grande. I just wish the National Endowment for the Arts and Public Broadcasting wouldn’t waste time on obscure post-modern material that nobody enjoys and, by association, actively alienates people from genuine fine arts.

        This is the first time I’ve commented here. I am 58 years old and am tired of my contemporaries crying about how there is no good music today. Stop living in the past, friends!Tune in to different outlets! I highly recommend a Philly-based station, WXPN. OK – it is product of the University of Pennsylvania, but there is no politics on air- they play everything from Patsy Cline to Yes, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Depeche Mode, right up to Sharon Van Etten. Hell, they played Sister Rosetta Tharpe today for her 110th birthday.Give something new a try – The Lumineers, The Head and the Heart, Ray LaMontaigne, Father John Misty, Mondo Cozmo, Boygenius, Soccer Mommy, the list is nearly endless.There is very good music being made, and many of you seem to have your heads in the sand.Peace.

        The live concert market is not what it used to be. Live Nation has bought up or put out of business the majority of the local promoters. They also own a lot of the venues and control ticket sales through Ticket Master where they enable legal ticket scalping which they get a cut of. People can resell tickets for in demand shows for huge markups. I used to live near Dothan, Alabama. Big time 70’s touring acts like the Eagles and Kiss played at their 4000 capacity civic center. Somehow it was economically viable for top acts back then to play backwater towns for $8 to $10 a ticket. Now they only play in a few mega cities and charge $300 plus per ticket.

Just look at how nuts sudden fame &amp; riches made too many big talents.Then there’s the body count.There’s all kinds of great stuff out there on them You Tubes.The free streamer Ditty TV is another good one, though its gender based wokery has gotten more intense lately.Another good source is NPR’s “Tiny Desk” shows, that feature top tier and up and comers making real music in real time.All is not lost.

        I’m a beginning Boomer (’46) and began playing drums at age nine. When I came upon James Brown at age 17, I went to see him at the Apollo in NYC. I was the only white guy to be seen and once I’d seen him perform, the Beatles were like a hootenanny act. I still love his stuff, but for the past ten or fifteen years, I’ve gone back to the music of my childhood: classical. I have had no interest in popular music (other than Latin American) in a looong time.

        A person from 1800 would listen to whatever it is all of you are talking about (1950s music? 1970s music? 1980s music?), listen to a sample of each, and tell you it was all modernist urinal cakes, and you’re arguing over the taste of the puck as if it means anything.

        Good article.  The rock band concept appealed to the Boomer through Millennial generations.  “Big Bands appealed to Silents. The new generations with their shorter than ever attention spans, prefer a single negro mumbling into an auto tune box or whatever. The cute white girls all make it because they were connected to begin with.It explains why the movie industry still exhumes guys like Stallone, Harrison Ford, and Tom Cruise to make action flicks: because most only the older generations go to see movies anymore.  Even frauds like Steven Seagal can eek out a paycheck doing straight to streaming dreck.I imagine the pop nonfiction book genre is suffering the same fate.

        The death of pop needs to accelerate, in order to destroy carnie wages as much as possible.  A society that makes a singer into a 9-figure asset holder is a sick society (same problem as sportsball being a path to riches).  And since the worst kind of people are behind the scenes making even more than the performers, it’s doubly urgent to kill it.No one will accuse me of having a refined taste in music, but I find that there are tools available to find things outside the mainstream that are very listenable.  One of the simplest for me is to use the “discovery” function in Amazon Music (a crappy app, but regardless).  So, I listen to some stuff I like on the app like Mark Knopfler or some first wave stuff or blues or whatever, and the computer chugs through the database and serves up a bunch of stuff I’ve never heard.  90% crap, but some very listenable stuff that leads to a worthwhile artist.  I’d never heard of Corb Lund without that app, but have come to enjoy his odd Canadian brand of country.Anyway, look around off the beaten path and you can find people doing decent stuff that will suit your tastes.

            Why are millions of Americans spending a sawbuck to authors, singers, actors, jocks, game coders, influencers?
What else can they do with it? If you are extraordinarily ambitious, you can find something scalable that creates social capital. But that’s not most people. Most are just looking for something to take their minds off the fact that for them, yesterday was the same as today, and tomorrow will be the same.
Without a reason to jump out of bed and hit the floor running, what fills that void is typically escapism.

        Great article.More and more people get that all the corporate slop shop offers is a pile of satanic MK slaves, but it’s up to older people to pass things down.  I mean, it’s not as if Gen X and the Millennials grew up on *Lawrence Whelk, ffs.
It might cheer everyone up to learn that Stranger Things used  ‘Running Up That Hill’ by Kate Bush and it subsequently reached the Top Ten in 34 countries.  The GTA games are packed with fantastic classics, too.  As long as the pilot light is kept on, that’s the main thing.

        Young people are all listening to K-pop. I know many middle-school age kids (kids of friends, neighbors, their friends, etc.) who are all K-pop fans.
I am not sure why, but this is where the masses are moving to. Also, new K-pop groups are popping up every other day.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ekr2nIex040&amp;pp=ygUTYXB0IHJvc2UgYnJ1bm8gbWFycw%3D%3D
also, to learn about the cutting edge for young people, you need to check TikTok. For example, I was on a long flight last year, and a young European-looking 20ish woman was sitting nearby. For most of the trip, she was watching TikTok videos talking about the struggle of Palestinians.
TikTok trendy music channels of teenagers are flooded with K-pops.

            The women are feminine and pretty and the men have that “adrogynous” look that young teenage girls seem to love. Kpop is basically the pop music we had in the 1990s, think Christina Aguilera, N-sync, etc. But our music moved away from that because we needed to be inundated with rap and hip and hop.

Once again, maybe these groups will all be forgotten in another two months, but the trend will last a lot longer. Also the trend shows the likes and dislikes of young people, who will be in their twenties 5-10 years from now and pay to see concerts.

        I keep getting calls from back east asking me if I’m going to Vegas to see Dead $ company at the sphere. That would be a big no, even though I could drive there in a day easily. I saw the Dead a bunch of times in the late 70’s and early 80’s. Even caught them at radio city for some acoustic sets. They were on the way down then 15 years into the experiment. 60 years into it and it’s a blatant money grab. Nostalgia is a big business, it’s working me over daily.

        “Music needs social proof to gain an audience and that is manufactured at the same place the music is now manufactured.”
This is what I’ve suspected my whole life: everyone I meet has zero interest in classical or jazz, but they spend inordinate amounts of time rattling off pop music they know to each other as a sort of status competition.  The king of the hipsters knows the most obscure shitty sounding bands of all.
I was noticing peasant herd mentality before it was cool.

        I used to think Country Music was the last “real” music left. Not anymore! It went to hell along with Pop. Bluegrass seems to be holding up pretty well. Lotsa fresh new young acts appearing all the time. I listen to SiriusXm all day at work. However, I’m starting to notice a “formula” emerging where they’re all beginning to sound alike. Of course I don’t expect today’s young Bluegrassers to come down from the hills with their banjers and fiddles in a tater sack like they once did. But I’d sure hate to see the last real music, played skillfully on real instruments with no electronic chicanery go “corporate” and turn into a bland, soulless product like everything else.

            Bluegrass is like Zydeco;  A little bit can go a long way, [because it’s all mostly the same crap]…  I did hear a Bluegrass band play Bela Fleck’s “Bigfoot”.  Now THAT was good!

        there are two songs that I can think of over the past few years that are good.
1) Til I Found You Stephen Bishop and Em Beilan
Reminds me of Patsy Cline or Roy Orbison
2) End of Beginning by Djo
The guy singing this is mainly an actor but he can sing too. Dreampop is the next frontier of music I think.
