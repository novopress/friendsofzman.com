        I‚Äôve been noticing how the GOP is opposing Trump, compared to Obama.  For the last 8 years, it was as if they could barely drag themselves out of bed to trudge wearily to the Hill and take their castor oil treatment.  Now, they‚Äôre positively crackling with zest for battle.  Every day brings a new challenge to Trump, an innovative new angle for sticking the knife into him.And it‚Äôs odd, but they seem to think they‚Äôre engaged in single combat with him.  The seem to consider the American people as some colossal whale that breached on November 8, then sank back beneath the surface of the ocean and disappeared.  It‚Äôs like the populace just doesn‚Äôt exist, even as spectators.  Senators treat this contest as a sort of ceremonial joust; they‚Äôre not sneaking around surreptitiously, they‚Äôre sallying forth with banners and pennants for each noisy attack.  They want the glory as well as the felicity of slaying the upstart Trump.What are they counting on for after they‚Äôve erased the November 8, 2016 election?  Do they imagine they can just saunter up to the voters and say, ‚ÄúOh, hi! It‚Äôs us again! All ready for another round of applauding our speeches and voting for us?  Remember those good old times before last year? It‚Äôs been too long. Can‚Äôt wait to get started.‚Äù

                I hope Trump will have a white house team that funnels campaign support to challenge all the gop senators up in 2018.  If the 8 or 9 incumbents face Trump supported challengers that will really get their attention.

            They were always going to oppose Trump.  That‚Äôs the main reason I voted for him.  To prove once and for all that the GOP is 100% full of shit.

            Reps are the Washington Generals to the Dem‚Äôs Harlaam Globetrotters.
50% of Dem campaign contributions come from same (((people))) as 25% of Rep contributions. Notice how both parties kiss up to AIPAC, Wall Street

        A young man I know goes to DC occasionally to visit friends and check out the political atmosphere. In the year or two leading up to the 2016 election he was at a party where a bunch of top GOP congressional aides were gathered. He asked one what issue they received the most mail and phone calls about. The dude said ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù. Then he asked what they were going to do about it. The reply was a sort of sneering grunt followed by ‚ÄúNothin&#x27;‚Äù.This is the attitude of your GOP.If it doesn‚Äôt change fast,  I‚Äôm not just going to sit out the next election, but vote for the most communist nigger-loving queer Democrat I can find.

                It feels to me that many of the Repubs in office will turn on Trump anyway, if the Dems throw down a strong move.  Complete with crocodile tears, as they give the McCain thumbs down to our President.

        I think it‚Äôs much more likely that Trumpian new blood will primary the useless cucks in the GOP and remake it.  Without Trump, the GOP had no future.  With Trump, it can remake itself.  But either way, the old GOPe needs to be swept away.

                The problem with guys like McCain and Graham is they are so well entrenched within the local GOP political system that they are nearly impossible to defeat in primaries.  They have corporate allies with a lot of money and an army of hired staff to do their dirty work. (http://bit.ly/1vGE4r4)

                    it comes down to whether or not the voters n those states are ‚Äúreachable‚Äù.  if they are, then a primary chalenge will have a strong chance ‚Äî with outside funding.   if the state is full of shit heads, like i suspect with AZ/SC/KY/WI then we are stuck with the turds for awhile.  key is to strip them of all perks and committee places.
i think that step#1 is to primary all the ‚Äúlittle fish‚Äù in 2018, so as to strip cuck1 and cuck2 of their leadership positions.

            Trump is not the kind of guy to lead that effort.  The most plausible first step would actually be for the House Freedom Caucus to declare itself an independent party and strip Ryan of the gavel.  And for 10-15 GOP Senators to ditch the McCain/McConnell/Graham/Collins wing of the Senate and do the same.
It‚Äôs not going to come from Trump.

                I‚Äôve been saying to anybody who will listen ‚Äì for quite a long time ‚Äì  that what this country has needed is a legitimate third party.The reality is that the Democrats and Republicans have manipulated the political process and the laws to make it appear as if they are the only alternatives.It also bears remembering ‚Äì that were a number of the Founders thought that political parties should be banned as they would inevitably corrupt the political process.There‚Äôs a HUGE number of people though ‚Äì who simply cannot imagine American politics with anything more than two big parties controlling everything ‚Äì as they literally think that the Dems and the Republicans ARE the government.  They cannot make the distinction.That‚Äôs how thoroughly the uniparty has corrupted politics in this country.That‚Äôs why it needs to be blown up by any means possible.

                            Our legislative system is all about getting a president elected and a majority in both houses of congress. You do this by creating a party that hopefully appeals to 51% of the electorate. Splitting into a 3rd party simply splits up the voters who are the most likely to support the ideology of those 2 smaller parties.  Its like how a 3rd party candidate tends to screw whichever party it is most similar to due to drawing off votes, thereby giving an advantage to the monolithic party that didn‚Äôt split.

                            The Whigs split and the tendency for support to break into a two party system forced them to die. I think the Republican should and will split into a populist, pro-White party and the Republicans will die. It would take a lot of Democrats from the Democrat party if the Republicans stopped supporting any outsourcing of jobs and supported working people more.
A solid pro-White party could do wonders if they didn‚Äôt mind being called Racist, Anti-Semites and Nazis.

                (1)  Third Party:  The commies captured one of the two parties last century, accomplishing one of their long-term goals.  They had the good sense not to expect much from a third-party effort.They also had quite a bit of patience and persistence.  They were not deterred by temporary lulls.  They were good at ratcheting:  gaining ground might be slow, but they rarely lost ground.(2) Trump:  Trump managed to win states that had been given up for lost to the Democrats.  He‚Äôs the logical person to ‚Äúrealign‚Äù the Republican party.(3)  GOPe:  I don‚Äôt think garden-variety Repubs, especially consultants and infrastructure,   are much concerned about whether they win office. Think about their *actual*  support for Obama policies, combined with their fighting Trump‚Äôs efforts to scuttle those policies.  It shows they‚Äôre happy to let the Dems do it.  Both parties are paid by the same masters.  They do OK whether they are in or out of office.

                    Prog Republicans leaning to join the Democrats would be healthy.  There are Democrats who hate their party too.  One of them, a governor, just switched to the GOP.  Either the GOP would survive smaller, but with a cleaner identity, or it would implode.  I actually prefer implosion because that‚Äôs how you shake the public out of their current paradigm.A lot of Sanders voters are natural Trump voters.  Not the pinkos, but the ones who see the country getting pillaged by corporatist and fascists.  The ones who felt Clinton was worse than Trump.I said before the convention last year that the most logical tickets representing the country would be Clinton/Bush vs Trump/Sanders in terms of the economic issues.  The pinkos with Sanders would have left to join Clinton/Bush  in the Government Party.

        If Clinton had won, we would be well on our way now to full social fracturing and economic collapse, followed by a real grassroots rebellion and eventual resurrection. As it stands, Trump is fanning the dying embers of hopefulness while the Deep State is executing a coup d‚Äôetat. We are witnessing the dawn of an oligarchical tyranny hidden behind the facade of democracy. The illusion that voting matters is what buys the time necessary to make this transition.

            People not as tuned into politics as we, are discovering the attempt of the uniparty to reverse the election. President Trump is  going to make this very clear with a campaign like tour through the country.  We will see if this causes them and Mueller to back off.  I doubt that they could start the impeachment process without a rebellion.

                Trump surely understands the power he has in going directly to the people and bypassing Washington DC and the mainstream media.  I suspect he is saving that strategy for when he really needs it to call out the bad guys, rather than dissipating it on matters of the here and now.His near term game is to make his enemies both reveal themselves and act insanely in doing so.  So far, so good on that front.  I sense that his true inner circle is taking down a lot of names, and just waiting for an indication of some big move by his enemies, some civilian version of Seven Days in May, perhaps, and then a lot of heads will roll.No way to run a government, but you go with what you‚Äôve got.

                    Am interested in our own ‚ÄòSeven Days in May‚Äô scenario. Which generals would be on our side and which have to be rounded up?  Or course the planning would be difficult until the leak  problem  is handled.  Let the President Trump be the one to launch the 2nd American Republic. Two hundred and forty one years was not bad.  Outlasted the French.

        All sorts of things I wish Trump would do.  Such as eliminating OPM‚Äôs Obamacare exemption for Congress and its employees.  That‚Äôs how you drain the swamp.  McCain plans to revive his immigration reform‚Ä¶thinks his brain tumor will give him a Ted Kennedy sympathy vote.
Like I said yesterday, the shift in this country is between a nationalist American party, and a borderless Globalist party.
Neither party reflects this new dynamic.

            From what I‚Äôve seen McStain voting against the Obamacare thing has made even more people wish that he dies a really painful death from his brain cancer.

                He voted against the Obamacare repeal because Trump banned trannies from military service.  That was one of McCain‚Äôs bizarro left-wing causes that got him invited onto all the right talk shows to trash Republicans as bigots.

            My read on the Democrats right now is they are still locked in Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs basement. They are the people under the stairs. Once she croaks, it will be a spasm of multi-culti lunacy and then it blinks out of existence. Just look around at the people in charge and waiting in the wings.The GOP, oddly enough, benefits by not actually being a coherent party. It‚Äôs just a dumping ground. My hunch though is within it will grow a new nationalist party, but only after a period of chaos. I think it starts this summer with a lot of primary challengers flying the nationalist flag.

                I think you may be right.  Some (D) governor just joined the GOP.  I wish Collins, McCain, Graham, and a few others would just go join Chuck Schumer and the Democrats.  That‚Äôs about how useful they are for us.  It‚Äôs like having a 5th Column inside the party staffed by Leftists.It‚Äôs just going to take a few people to jump ship from the Dems and Repubs to get the ball rolling.  You know I‚Äôve been a fan for a long time of the HFC and the most right-wing senators to just abandon the GOP and caucus independently from either party.  Neither party would be able to attain a majority in either house, throwing the Congress into chaos, and forcing big time concessions to win the gavel.

They both remind me of that great exchange from the moving ‚ÄúHeartbreak Ridge‚Äù:Lieutenant M.R. Ring: Sir, I gave the order to take this hill.Maj. Malcolm A.

                            While I hate McCain I don‚Äôt believe that you can fault his military career. He wasn‚Äôt the best aviator but‚Ä¶well the worst is far above the rest of us. I also don‚Äôt fault him for reading scripts, if he dis so, that they made him read after torture. People can only stand so much. It took a lot of guts to stay in prison when he could have been released.

                    You are obviously only remotely acquainted with WI politics.  It took a decade‚Äôs efforts by many people to turn that state purple from deep blue.  Paul Ryan effectively participated.  Just not perfectly from a nationalist party point of view that suddenly emerged this year.  His effective comfort zone is suddenly no longer strategically important, largely due to enemy action.
Enthusiasm is good if it motivates focused effort in potentially positive directions.  Demanding instant perfection to a new, untried, poorly defined concept is counter-productive: Makes one look like a lightweight dilettante.  Don‚Äôt be that guy.

        To me, some of the biggest issues rest with the political class in DC in BOTH parties that are 70+ years old and have been in their seats for many, many years.  Within 10 years, even 8, a LOT of the old guard on both sides will be out.  There is a LOT of rot.  Change is coming.  Power is rearranging and there is enormous pressure on the status quo in DC.I am disgusted and angry about the Mueller thing as anyone, but in one way, this witch hunt is clarifying ..  if it‚Äôs not clear to the folks yet just how busted DC is/was‚Ä¶  it will be very clear in short order.   In tearing into Trump and his family and finances and past, and the inaction or collusion of the GOPe and the media‚Äôs obvious role in partisan politics, there will be no going back to the way things were pre 2008.Really, the Democrats started all of this in 2000 with Gore.  It‚Äôs been ratcheted up ever since.  They have torn at the fabric of the legitimacy of our system ever since and now most of DC is in on it.  Historic and painful to live through in real time, but I have to wonder where we‚Äôll be in 10 years ‚Ä¶ when all the flower-children of the 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs are finally out of leadership.

        When I was younger and somewhat unaware of many of the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù issues ‚Äì taxation was my big pet peeve, since it was the screw job that I could see plainly every time I got a paycheck.If somebody asked me why I voted for Republicans I would say : ‚Äù because the Republicans tell me that they‚Äôre going to lower my taxes‚Äù.  After getting screwed over a few times on those promises, I changed that to be :‚Äù I know they‚Äôre probably lying , but at least they say they‚Äôre going to lower taxes. How stupid would I be if I voted Democrat when they tell me right to my face that they‚Äôre going to raise my taxes?  At least when a Republican says he‚Äôll lower taxes ‚Äì and he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì I have something to screw him with. With a Democrat the screw job is on me and it‚Äôs entirely my own fault‚ÄùIf anybody is paying attention ‚Äì they‚Äôll notice that the Republicans stopped saying they‚Äôll lower taxes quite some time ago. Once that happened that made them pretty much the equivalent of the Dems in my eyes ‚Äì except that the Dems seem to have take a turn into outright Communism, which the Republicans haven‚Äôt explicitly done (yet).

            Republicans *did* lower taxes. Reagan lowered taxes dramatically. Bush the Senior raised taxes and paid the price. Clinton raised them even more. Bush the Junior lowered taxes.With the ObamaCare surtaxes my top marginal tax rate is nearly 50%, and I live in a low-tax state. In California it‚Äôs well over 50%.Tax reform has soured as a wedge issue because our tax system has become so progressive that very few people pay any meaningful amount of taxes anymore. When nearly 50% of Americans pay no tax and another 30% pay very little, tax reform just doesn‚Äôt have the legs it used to have.Don‚Äôt be under any illusions. If Republicans had not held the line on taxes in the 80s, 90s, and 00s the Dems would have driven top marginal tax rates well into the 60%-70% range. Your votes were not wasted.

        In 2005 here in NJ,  we had the major choices for Governor,  John Corzine and Doug Forrester.   Both of them promising to outdo each other to lower the state income tax by double digit amounts.  AKA ‚Äì Both of them were lying out their ass.  Any fool could see that.   When it came time to vote,  I voted for a guy calling himself ‚ÄúNJ Weedman‚Äù.  His only campaign issue was legalizing marijuana in NJ.   I voted for him because he was the only guy running (out of all the parties and non-parites) that was actually telling the truth on what he wanted to do.If the last election had come down to Hillary &amp; Yeb,  I would have stayed home, not that a GOP vote would have mattered in NJ.   I voted for Trump because I was tired of the establishment.   As for the so called GOP,  I‚Äôm done with them.  Crying we don‚Äôt have the house, then we don‚Äôt have the Senate,  then we don‚Äôt have the White House to McConnell not long ago saying we don‚Äôt have 60 votes.   Paul Ryan deliciously ambushed by a disgruntled voter telling him the same thing.   Listening to Ryan‚Äôs response is a clear indicator that he spends more time working on making polished excuses than working on the promises he and other RINOs have made the past 7 years.    Today‚Äôs GOP reminds me of one of those old WWII stories.  We have a couple of Democrats, exhausted, out of ammunition but feigning with their empty rifles.  Along comes a company of heavily armed GOP and rather than rolling over what should be token resistance,  they give ground and surrender.   No stomach for a fight.

        The real divide is between Trump Nationalists and Sanders Socialists. (I put all Democrats and about half of the Republicans in Congress in the latter group). The Alt-Right is not going to win on ideas. There is a gut thing going on in the Nationalist movement, a hard mix of realism, patriotism and bedrock principle, that to me is what the the Alt-Right, and the country, should be measuring itself by. Primaries and general elections are where change will happen. Candidates that we resonate with will appear. Unless we can change the system (a very tall order), we have to vote. Rest assured the Socialists will be voting.

            Nonsense.  There weren‚Äôt even enough Sanders Socialists to win the primary, and their number as a % of the dems is decreasing due to increasing numbers of non-whites who don‚Äôt care about ideology, only free shit.Their are a number of divides, the 2 biggest divides are nationalist/globalist and racial.  They are closely related, and many other divides can largely be subsumed within those headings but not perfectly (rich/poor, urban/rural, etc.)Change isn‚Äôt happening in elections, change is happening in our demographics which drive elections.  In 15-20 years Texas will turn blue, and along w/ similar demographic changes in the rest of the nation Republicans will become unable to win elections. The only way this can be stopped is to strip citizenship from people which would likely be unconstitutional.https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SOC2016report.pdf

        What worries me, is now that the curtain has been draw away, more and more people will realize what a sham it all is, and will clamor for a dictator to make the metaphoric trains run on time. Worked for Lenin, Mussolini, and Hitler. Too many people get weary of the burdens of citizenship, like thinking about the implications of what is going on. They prefer to let someone else do it all, so they can go back to their TV reality shows and barbecues.

            If you value right-wing ideology and Western culture, the least violent method of preserving them is a dictator using his power to deport or exterminate liberals/ non-whites. You can whine about how that‚Äôs EVIL all you want, but it is a demographic certainty none-the-less.

        Since it appears that the establishment Repub‚Äôs have lost their fear of the voters, the first step right now needs to be re-creating some of that fear amongst the GOPe swamp dwellers.  Remember how all the Gang of 8 donor signaling on ‚Äòimmigration reform‚Äô suddenly went quiet when the House #3 got primaried out in VA in 2014_?So, we need to pick a _few_ targets and nationalize their primaries like Dave Brat did in VA.  Paul Ryan in WI would be ideal_!  While winning is ideal, it would almost be enough to make them burn all their slush/campaign funds just to keep their nominations.Here‚Äôs a better written, broader gauge exposition:https://amgreatness.com/2017/07/31/republicans-lost-art-deterrence/

            Losing an election isn‚Äôt their greatest fear. Their greatest fear is being cut off from the donor $$. Their salary is chickenfeed comparatively, so winning an election by pissing off donors is worse than losing an election while keeping the donors happy. For example, Eric Cantor is now making $3.4 million, and was the highest paid board member in 2015‚Ä¶

                Not disputing your statement of facts re Cantor‚Äôs money, but so what_?  To those people loss of power and status matters at least as much as money.
The big thing is that amnesty died in 2014.  The seemingly pre-ordained ‚ÄòGang of 8‚Äô bill never was even brought to the floor for a vote after he was cut off.  Killing that particular chicken _did_ frighten the watching monkeys in the swamp/jungle.  Results matter.

                    Empirically, Congress cares more about donors than voters. Cantor isn‚Äôt the only one that did the donors bidding and then lost an election. Obamacare lead to a bunch of Dem losses.
If what you say is true, your example of the Go8 bill would be the norm, rather than a rare exception in extreme circumstances.

                        Why the norm_?  Don‚Äôt see your logic at all.  Look at it from the individual Rep‚Äôs point of view.  We should be looking for points of leverage in the process rather than just throwing up dustIn order to access the big money you talk about, any Rep first needs to be in office.  To be in office they need to be elected.  To be elected they need votes, volunteers and money.  Also, depending on their relative strength in the above, they normally need party endorsement.At the minimum, party endorsement brings access to that party‚Äôs ballot line.  Else they have to run a write-in campaign, which is very expensive and uncertain but can succeed (e.g. the execrable Lisa Murkowsky).  Ballot lines cost money and some staff to maintain.  Vote fraud minimization also requires money, volunteers and some organized staff.  Hence the benefit to an established  party.Ad buys and content can be organized by anyone with money, hence consultants.  Parties have networks of (semi)  reliable consultants.  But people can win despite not having consultants network access, e.g. US Rep David Brat, as mentioned above.  But then they need volunteers plus outside money.Donor money can be ideological or transactional (the classic access buying).  Ordinarily, big donor money is transactional (favor for favor) and both parties are historically fine with that.  However, as a counter-example, the homosexual agenda has been successfully advanced by big ideological donors, mostly from NY and CA.  The Prog shrieking about the Koch Bros is all the evidence you need to posit that they see ideological big donors as their preserve and intend to keep it that way.So a nationalist party needs to either take over an existing party or ideological big donors (and they‚Äôre out there) to create the required parallel infrastructure plus volunteers, not to mention candidates with big balls.  So who‚Äôs working on any of this_?

        ZMan, you tend to fluctuate between writing that the GOP is an independent group that looks at politics in terms of how it benefits the GOP and not just the other side of the Demopublican coin. It doesn‚Äôt look at things as Democrats vs. Republicans and hasn‚Äôt for years. The elected stooges may have joined the GOP early in their career believing in the fundamental differences in the Democratic platform and the Republican platform, but they were Michael Corleoned at some point and look at politics now strictly as how it benefits them personally. They are now belong to the Haves and their opponents are the Have Nots. In other words, us.It has amazed me for over two decades how difficult it is to gain control of county and State GOP‚Äôs. It should be simply a matter of showing up with more people than the others and taking control locally, then taking control of the State group. But, the parasites in control have barriers in place to prevent this and the Have Nots either have to work or don‚Äôt have the funds to compete with the entrenched power structure. Retired Whites might have the time and the money to do this, but they also receive so many gimmes from the government that they have a vested interest in keeping the status quo. I think human nature is lazy so, short of the cartridge box, I don‚Äôt know what we could do to peacefully take back our country.I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre familiar with Hegelian dialectics. This is the system that enables our enslavement. Hegel was a kraut so he used as many words as possible to say as little as possible. But, ((((Someone)))) actually read through his work without falling asleep and saw a way to retain and extend financial control over the people of the world. This is just conjecture, but I believe that mathematicians actually took Hegel‚Äôs work to the next level and were able to enable physical control mechanisms over large populations using the institutions already in place. Have you ever read Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars? It is interesting in that it postulates that introducing stress into a country can be done and can be implemented and measured using equations that resemble electrical circuitry. Like The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, it may or may not be true, but it certainly explains more than official reasons. Plus, the opponents label The Protocols a forgery, which can mean a copy of an original document, not a false misrepresentation.

                I stayed registered Republican for years and years only so I could vote for the most ‚ÄúF-you‚Äù conservatives I could find.  People who would not only turn over the apple cart but set the pieces on fire.  Finally getting to vote for a Trump made me very happy, no matter how things go from here.
The urban vote is up for grabs next time around, and I suspect many urbanites hate the gay, feminine, emotional stuff.

            Explain how he would do this. In the past, people have referred to the President as the Head of his Party. The Party has already shown that they do not believe this. How would Trump purge the Republican Party? Unless those most entrenched in the Republican Party refuse to accept his actions, what legal right does he have to purge the Republican Party?

        ‚ÄùIt is, to a lesser extent, what kept a laughable squirrel like Bernie Sanders in the Democrat primary.‚ÄùHe also demonstrated just how weak a candidate the Lizard Queen was.

        The democrat and republican parties are both dying on the vine.  President Trump is a consequence of this vacuum.  It will be game over for democrats when Wikileaks  rips the brakes out of their propaganda machine and exposes the criminal underside of the cartel.  When the avalanche hits the swamp the ugliness will be hard to bear.  The mutant survivors will be our new political party.

            People are very self-centered.  When they really understand that the criminal establishment political order is doing nothing for them (does the average person think that unfettered immigration or old men in dresses in the girls restroom is any good for anyone?), and the reformers are making things better here and there, it will be game over for the establishment.Sadly, the criminality will largely be ignored.  Happily, the stupid inability to do anything right, combined with the economic stripping of most of the rest of us, for their personal benefit, will not go unnoticed or unpunished.It‚Äôs all in how one frames things.  Trump is really good at frames.  Such as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.  It‚Äôs part of the landscape now, no going back for the mainstream media.  Ha-ha!

        ‚ÄúThe thing is,we‚Äôre all men of our age, which means our opinions and inclinations are, to a great degree, formed by the prevailing opinions of our age. Just as Progressives control our moral framework, the two parties control our political framework.‚ÄùIf by ‚Äúall‚Äù you mean ‚Äúmost‚Äù or ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù then I can agree with you. However, those of us who became Rothbardian market anarchists are certainly not fooled by the con game that is politics in this country.I have not voted for president since 1980 until I voted this time against the evil Clinton. That vote was purely defensive. I believe that she would have worked hard to destroy the country and my family if full of young kids who deserve a chance at life.I did vote for Ron Paul in the primary here in Florida but there was no chance in hell he was ever going to be on the ballot for President.As I see it, until we dismantle the empire we have little chance. And the elites play divide and conquer so very well.I was making comments at a place called the conservative tree-house or something like that (run by someone called ‚Äúsundance‚Äù). I was getting all sorts of ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and responses over the course of several months when I posted a comment that was slightly negative about Trump‚Äôs bombing Syria. Bam! I was banned without so much as an explanation. Weird thing was that that comment kept getting ‚Äúlikes‚Äù for a couple of weeks after I could no longer respond. (notifications came in e-mail)The alt-right, ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù, libertarians, hard core market anarchists, and others don‚Äôt seem to be able to cooperate towards the goal of ending the present tyranny.May God have mercy on us; we are doing the children a real disservice by not fighting the empire now.~ Mark

        I think you nailed it here. I have been a republican voter my whole adult life. After years of promises to repeal the Obama care take over of the health care insurance industry only to fail on the half-hearted attempt to replace it with Obama care light I may never vote again in a national election. Fug them. Hard. They asked for it. Begged for it. Earned it. Ben Franklin called it. We have failed the Republic.

        The problem conservative voters face is that conservatives don‚Äôt run for office, so with rare exceptions, progressives are the only option on the ballot.  There are, admittedly, progressives who pretend to be conservative and make conservative noises, but they never seem to have enough votes to pass conservative legislation.Currently, the Republicans are acting as if they won the 2018 elections and that Trump rode their coat tails into office.  Conservatives can‚Äôt win voting for Republicans but they may have better luck disrupting Democrat primaries. After all, Democrats will vote for any Democrat; they‚Äôve yet to encounter Democrats in name only.

        I have already washed my hands of the Republican Party, did so before the election when I witnessed their disgustingly shabby treatment of Trump (their party‚Äôs candidate! The choice of their supporters!) and realized that he was taking it on the chin for me. Jesus with a comb-over.The only possible redemption for the GOP is a wholesale wiping out of the current roster. To that end, as long as Trump is president, I will vote against the Republican incumbent in the primaries and against the Democrat in the generals. After Trump I will not vote for either party.I would be so happy to see Trump run in 2020 under the banner of a new party, say the ‚ÄúConservative American‚Äù party. With the passion of his supporters and the energy and $$$ of a presidential election, that new party could actually become viable and render the GOP a minor player, like the Greens.The GOP must die.

        Hi Z.  I know so many of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù America seem to hate the Jews and push them out as if we are diseased. I believe that is a mistake. I am a conservative Jew and there are many more than you may realize. Crazy liberal Jews have had a hand at the current destruction of our country, and sensible conservative Jews would like to help correct that wrong.  But talk of exclusion will only embolden crazy people to the detriment of all Americans. Remember that ML King was a life-long Republican.

            As a voting bloc conservative Jews are irrelevant. As a means of stopping or even slowing the leftist radicals of their tribe they are ineffective. That many of them are neocons renders them harmful and counterproductive. When we think of nationalist Jews we think of Israel. In that over 50% of Jews now consider themselves to be non-believers, yet still Jewish, we are led more and more to think that Jewishness connotes a race rather than a religion.Given that the left has decided that identity politics is the wave of the future, and we know that trying the DR3 thing was a big joke, we are doing the necessary thing to survive, and that is to beat them at their own game. When some 90% of a racial group declares for the other side in a contest of identity politics they pretty much have spoken for the group as a whole.I have a great deal of sympathy for the conservative Jew, and I hope that in the days to come a peaceful means of settling this question can be arrived at. However, their fate is not an existential problem for us at this juncture. We want to survive as a people and a nation, and if warring against the ‚ÄúJew‚Äù is a necessary part of that fight, then that is a step we have to take. I don‚Äôt think sitting back and pretending the problem doesn‚Äôt exist is an answer.

        I don‚Äôt think this essay is wrong or premature at all.  The Republicans are going to get crushed in 2018 at the rate they are going, and it has nothing to do with Trump either outside the fact they are literally stabbing him in the back.  I will make my prediction right now- Democrats win the House in 2018 outright, and the Senate ends up divided 50-50 and McCain switches parties to make it 51-49.

            The Republicans that run against Trump in the 18 primaries will go down in defeat.  That‚Äôs because they believe the fake press that tells them they will lose if they support Trump.   Flake in AZ right is a prime example of this happening.

            I can imagine your above scenario in which the R‚Äôs get crushed; I can also imagine a scenario in which the established/McCain/Ryan wing of the GOP is replaced by populists.  What I CAN‚ÄôT  imagine is establishment GOPers replacing establishment Democrats ‚Äî there seems to be no passion behind either of the established parties and thus the stasis will remain.The country seems to be bifurcating into the Sanders/socialists on one side and Trump/populists on the other.Frankly, I see civil war.Considering the established parties have the coercive apparatus and listening ability of the old Soviets, I‚Äôm not at all sure that the people (populists) can prevail.  The odds are against ordinary Americans, sadly, as they attempt to regain their power over the so-called deep state.What are our weapons?  Where is our army?1.  We aren‚Äôt organized in any meaningful manner.  Trump may be a leader, but he has no second tier of deputies, or state-level organizations.  I do think organizations qua organizations are overrated, but leaders usually emerge within localities, and we need this to happen to prevail against the fed government ‚Äî I don‚Äôt see this happening. I hope I‚Äôm wrong.2.  We don‚Äôt have the capacity to bypass their communication channels (witness how easily FB and Twitter block populist voices from their platforms, and there‚Äôs nothing that can be done about it.)  Without the capacity to communicate with each other, secretly and covertly, all efforts will be stymied.  Yes, I know about GAB and other wonderful sites, but quickly they will shut them down when threatened.  Perhaps, we need to go back to phone trees and written messages, but this presumes we know each other, which we don‚Äôt because we‚Äôre not organized!  Let them use the Internet (which we can decode and decipher to our advantage.)3.  We, as a large cohort, don‚Äôt quite grok the significance of the moment ‚Äî we‚Äôre at the tipping point RIGHT NOW.  It‚Äôs not mere lethargy, but ignorance as well ‚Äî people just don‚Äôt grasp they‚Äôre mortally threatened.  Until ordinary people see the government for what it is, they won‚Äôt fight.  And a half-hearted fight is one surely we‚Äôll lose.  This, I think, is our biggest problem.So ‚Ä¶ yes, though many of us recognize that our votes are a joke and the system is dangerously fraudulent, we don‚Äôt have the will or capacity to do anything about it.By the way, I do like the idea of going off grid, becoming as independent as possible, forming coalitions of like-minded neighbors (harder than I thought), and meeting surreptitiously on sites such as this.  This is purely defensive, though.We need an offense.
