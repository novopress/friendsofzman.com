        Ironically, the Democrats have installed an incredibly bad liar as their presidential candidate.  Kamala has so many tells that people instinctively get uncomfortable just watching her.  She dissembles, moves around uncomfortably, talks like a kindergarten teacher, then cackles nervously.
The incompetence of the party is breathtaking.  They could have had a smooth liar like Newsome but went with the DEI hire instead.

            On behalf of all kindergarten teachers, two of whom taught our kids very well, I protest that comparison!  I doubt there’s a single kindergarten teacher as dumb and as bad a liar as Kamala….

                Teachers – particularly female teachers – are an incredibly stupid lot.  They want the whole world to be ‘fair’ and obey the rules all the time.  They are fully on board with the feminization of society, which has crippled it.  There’s areason Laura Ingalls Wilder had to quit teaching when she married.  People back then understood and enforced a woman’s proper role and priorities.

                    Well if its not fair and people don’t obey the rules, how do things usually go for females?  Nothing wrong with wanting that, the rules just have to make sense, which they currently do not.  Protection amongst the herd.  Hard to hate them for it.  Kinda like the old fable the scorpion and the frog.

                    Want to straighten out grade school teachers?  Demand that they *major* in the subject(s) they teach when earning their university degree.This is of course, even more important at the high school level.Today, these “surplus” degreed women major in “education” of some sort in the College of Education.  Meaning they are simply indoctrinated in Leftist thought and educational theory and leave having little more basic subject knowledge than the students they are in charge of—if that’s even the case. It is *impossible*—for even me—to be certified in this State to teach K-12 without at least a couple of years in the College of Education.  That’s licensing shenanigans preventing entry into the field at its finest.Yet, I can walk onto any college campus and teach students and certify advanced degrees!  That’s what the hell is wrong with education—we have the worse of the worse going into it when the exact opposite should be true!What’s that Woody Allen quip—“Those who can’t do, *teach*, those who can’t teach, teach *physical education*!”

                        Ph.D. in quantum electrodynamics from MIT not qualified to teach a 7th-grade science class. Some dingbat with a bachelor’s in education from Morehead State is.
Pretty good indicator of what an idiotic place AINO is.

                        I took ONE education class in college – on children’s literature– because the old lady who had taught it for decades retired and a well-known children’s author was hired to teach it.  Admittedly, she could have been better organized, but she taught about great and classic kids’ books.  All the education majors in the class hated it because she didn’t ‘teach’  them how to teach kids to read books.

                            In defense of the professor, the other teacher candidates you were with, were obviously morons. As I’m sure you know.AND , in defense of teaching children how to read (which– believe it or not is actually based in the science of structured literacy–) it takes more than just one semester to learn that.im actually studying that now: how to teach reading to K-4 students.And I will say, that aside from the namby-pamby, awful children’s “literature” courses, the science of reading is surprisingly cut-and-dry.i wouldn’t still be in the program, if it was namby-pamby methodology.Just my two cents “from the inside.”

                        This is exactly correct. I teach secondary ed., and I came about the job in a backwards manner (I majored and MA in my subject – then fell into teaching later). I know my stuff. Most of my coworkers know nothing. I had a coworker last year, in English, working on her dissertation, say that the class was hard because she “doesn’t write well.” I couldn’t help but quip, “Well then, how do you teach writing?” I can assure you, however, that she does know how to put safe space logos on her wall…

                        “Want to straighten out grade school teachers? Demand that they *major* in the subject(s) they teach when earning their university degree.”No-one wants to. There’s an incestuous relationship between colleges of education, state licensing boards, and teachers’ unions to ensure that stupid people become teachers, not real subject experts. Plus in national politics no-one gives a rat’s ass about public schooling (regardless of the BS rhetoric). Of course the good private schools don’t give a cuss about licensure and just hire competent teachers. Students in colleges of education are typically among the bottom quartile of university students in terms of intelligence (if not the bottom decile). The curriculum of colleges of education is just meaningless bullshit — “equity”, postmodernist garbage, and the like. Nothing of substance. If you ever go for an interview to a public schools, the interviewers are interested in your classroom management skills, how you’re going to bring the stupid up to speed (which can’t be done), and “equity.” No-one’s interested in your subject knowledge or how you’re going to teach it. The inevitable outcome is hundreds of millions of ill-schooled Americans.

                            Agreed. Having said that, the intrinsic merit of students is a far better indicator of likely learning outcomes than the quality of the teacher, her pedagogical approach, and even her knowledge of the subject. In other words, if the kids are stupid criminals in the making, no amount of education of any sort will make a dent in their thick craniums.

If the bar has been set so low that even the stupid can jump over it, then the smart ones tune out, get bored, become rebellious, and even if they don’t, learn next to nothing because there’s not much in the syllabus. Let’s take high school math for example — there’s algebra 1, then algebra 2, then pre-calculus. There’s a heavy and mind-crippling overlap between these three subjects. Anyone with an IQ over 115 is going to either tune out or need ritalin. This is the road to Idiocracy.

                            Arshad Ali:  Most private schools now – not just prep schools but Christian schools – brag that they are fully ‘certified’ (by Christian school certification agencies). Which means all their starry-eyed young teachers have . . . education degrees.  Both of my sons’ best teachers were older women without such.  Pulled the younger one out of his Christian school when his middle-school teachers were new hires, ed majors,  all about ‘group work’ and other nonsense.

                                Just an aside—although I’m certain no one here misses the unmentionable aspect of the “why” of group work.I was around before the pernicious concept came about and was applied and afterwards.  Make no mistake about it.  Group work was designed to enable “group grading”.  This enables departments to mix in underperforming students—you know who—and allow them to (pretend to) achieve a passing grade.Collaboration is no doubt an essential part of learning and future job performance, but often allows “free riders”.  The competent despises it for that reason.  A good, equally yoked team however is an awesome force to contend with in the private sector.Even when I was still around, there were students who despised such projects.  Some instructors went so far as to allow a single (brilliant) student to do his own “project” and form a “group”.  Other (excellent) instructors parsed out, or evaluated each student’s aspect of contribution to the “group” project.  Students would then have to each present *their* aspect of contribution to the project, and receive grading upon that aspect.  Lazy instructors however, just let the students divide to work up among themselves and award a single grade to the project that was each student’s final class grade.  Sigh.

Not to mention obscenely overpaid. My neighbor was a 5th grade teacher. Salary? $100k for 10 months. Her husband was a gym teacher. He also made $100k. Retirement at age 55 after 30 years.
Meanwhile, yours truly earned a doctorate and ended up as an adjunct… I was paid $2000 per section to teach prison inmates college credit courses. Half the class were convicted murderers.

                            The murderers were actually the best students. You have some guy doing 25 to life for killing someone when he’s eighteen, and now he’s 42 and coming up on his first parole hearing. Not only does he want to show the parole board he’s a good boy and they should let him out, he’s anadultnow. He’s had to accept that he may never get out. He has to accept and own it. He’s a much better student than an 18-year old kid who goes to community college because he has no idea what else to do.

                        Adjunct status is a horror.  Fortunately we did not hire those, but did hire “post-doc’s”, most likely due to Fed money that came along with them. We sometimes granted adjunct status upon request from above, but never saw those folk within the dept.  Instead we most often hired full-time instructors on three year contracts.  The money was good.  In those days, even approaching 6 figures, if you were a long timer, but you worked for it via class teaching.I have never witnessed more abuse than with post-doc’s.  Totally sad because we knew that this was a last gasp chance to win a tenure tract position within the dept.  It never happened, so how they took or were offered such a position I never figured out.

                            The whole adjunct racket was one of the primary reasons I never pursued a professorship. Didn’t want to schlep around from place to place for perhaps seven years in hopes of snagging the holy grail. And even if you possess that grail, it could be in some dreadful place such as Rutgers-Camden or USC.

            Yes. But that is because they needed to use the symbolism of Walz/Harris to tell the truth. The mean old White guy screaming at Whites that they are enemy number one while the pogrom dialed up into overdrive became too much even for the sportsball addled consoomers. So, they needed to make the truth more palatable – supposedly. ‘Hey Whitey. We won’t kill you all. See. Here is the place we have reserved for you in Our New Order.’Of course, that is a lie too. That second place White guy in the future won’t really be white. He’ll fade further to the background but his money will be front and center. See the Bush and Bowman campaigns for the complete picture, not of where we are headed, but of where we are already at.

            “The incompetence of the party is breathtaking.”It really is, with biden I always got the impression he’s such a pathological liar that when he lies he isn’t even really conscious of it. Like that famous moment when he was in Michigan talking to blue collar workers where one of them went off script &amp; called him out for wanting to disarm everyone. Biden instantly &amp; seemingly reflexively shouted “BULLSHIT!” at him swearing up &amp; down he would never attempt to take people’s guns.This is a guy who spent his entire political career trying to disarm people &amp; bragged about it like he’s proud of it. But that exact moment he suddenly morphed into Charlton Heston in that moment. Admittedly he’s a unique case of being extremely dumb, senile &amp; a life long pathological liar but those attributes used to be very common among politicians. That was the old norm, the type of people they used to prefer to have interfacing with the public but not anymore.For a while I thought they just stopped caring about trying to maintain some semblance of being convincing when lying but as time goes on I’ve come to suspect that its actually deliberate. It seems like it went from trying to lie to swindle people to lying in such a way to rub it in our faces. It’s as though they get off on knowing we know they’re lying.For me it’s become more &amp; more difficult to see it any other way. It really became noticeable to me when the media claimed biden was the most popular president ever elected while simultaneously admitting they were apart of a conspiracy to rig the election on the front page of Time magazine.That’s relatively tame now as they’re claiming the same exact thing about a candidate who got less than 1% of the vote, was knocked out of the race in the first democratic debates &amp; then magically became vice president after not answering a single question during the VP debate instead cackling the whole time. This woman had horrible ratings for her job as the border czar &amp; made a complete fool of herself for four years. Now that same person is on track to become the next most popular president in the history.As you pointed out they could’ve picked someone who at least tries to be suave &amp; isn’t so comically stupid that they talk like they’re a preschool teacher with down syndrome but they chose the worst, most intellectually insulting candidate possible.This is like when Caligula attempted to make a horse a consul except I’d argue this is even more ridiculous. I have no doubt in my mind this is intentional &amp; a deliberate act of sadistic ridicule directed towards the citizenry. The most stunning part about it to me is the fact that half the population is not only going along with it but pretending this isn’t a sick joke being played on us.I have to constantly remind myself that these same run of mill leftists have been claiming in all seriousness that men who throw on women’s clothing are biologically indistinguishable from real women. I don’t know why stuff like this even shocks me but it does. Every time I think I’ve finally become desensitized to it all I’m inevitably reminded that I’m still foolishly projecting my own sense of rationality onto the population. I keep erroneously thinking that there’s some theoretical limit as to what people will obdurately regurgitate from the media &amp; politicians but it’s been clear for a long long time now that there is no limit to it.

                Well put. Is there someone well versed in psychology that could weigh in here? I know very little, but I’ve seen discussion (here, quite possibly) that some of what you describe – e.g. putting into place a clearly inept leader – could be a deliberate demoralization tactic. It should come as no surprise that a President, even a competent one, is never wholly in command. At best he delegates matters to his staff. The present leader is so visibly enfeebled that he probably can’t even take care of his basic daily needs, much less attend to affairs of state. His assistants do all the needed work, directed by unseen powers. A Harris presidency would be more of the same. Now Harris may not be all there either but at least she can read the TelePrompTer. The point is, they don’t even try very hard to hide the Puppetmaster aspect of it all that much.

            I think the worst thing about her is the way everything she say is always dripping with condescension. She acts like she thinks she’s the smartest person in every room. This behavior is galling when the person doing it really is very smart. When a simpleton like Kneepads does it, it’s downright infuriating. I literally can’t listen to her talk without feeling rage.

                        You do understand that the reaction to deflation is inflation, right? If you have a government with a central bank, it will print as fast as it has to in order to avoid having to pay their debts in deflated currency, right?
Unless you figure out a way to wrest control of the currency, even a moderate deflation will result in the central bank inflating it away.
What makes you think they won’t do whatever it takes to bail out the bankers?

                                Why? Go back to basics. Too much money chasing too few goods. All it takes to avoid inflation is to grow supply faster than you grow money.
I don’t know whether that would be possible under Uniparty spending. Low interest rates are not “stimulus”. Those mean people come up with goofy business plans like putting googly eyes on rocks and selling them on eBay. Higher rates mean you have to convince people to lend you their savings, which are paying interest, and you need to show them they are investing in an even more productive asset.

                                True enough. I am more pessimistic. The blockchain preserves every transaction, so tracing every satoshi is just a matter of time, or maybe it’s already been done. Would not surprise me if NSA already has a searchable database of most of the blockchain, and is filling in the gaps.Precious metals are better, but suffer the same limitation as people evading the lockdowns — their neighbors ratting them out.Fed-controlled digital currency is worst nightmare. The value in “your” wallet can be limited to whatever they want you to be able to buy, or can be placed on hold indefinitely. For any reason or no reason at all.

                                    There will always be a need for non-tracked real goods and maybe services. Sure, the government may have maximal control via a CBDC. Knowing that one’s wealth could be seized or erased at a whim would only increase the desire of many people to convert those credits into anything of value; notably something resistant to vanishing at some bureacrat’s whim. It might not be precious metals. But any tradable asset is fair game. In modern times it’s been canned food, cigarettes, chocolate, nylon stockings when they were a novelty, etc. Sure, the government could seize goods, but it’s not nearly as convenient as changing a few figures on a monitor in your office.

                                        Agreed, so long as you can avoid having to trade with anyone who would rat you out for an extra ration of beans. Or are Feds themselves, as we’ve seen any number of times since 9/11, including stuff one would not expect, like the Michigan Militia, Malheur, the “kidnapping” of Whitmer, Ray Epps and J6, etc. IIRC, in the takedown of Aryan Brotherhood, all but 2 were released because they were government agents.
I get it, security is on you. I just think slowing that down as much as possible gives us time to come up with less risky alternatives.

            Imagine if the Athenians had fiat currency! In Kagan’s (yes I know…) book on the Peloponnesian Wars, he describes Athens’ treasury reserves in great detail at the outset of the War. Trireme crews expected payment in PMs lol. Our Neocons get Ukrainians to die for paper hrvinias. The wars of yore ended when one side ran out of hard currency. Yet another argument for the gold standard….

            Wall Street knows what the real numbers are, and acts accordingly (see Goldman Sachs before the 2008 crash – they were selling those junk CMOs to suckers while betting against them at the same time). Those fake numbers that come out are from the government and for propaganda(“why are you all too stupid to see how great Biden is for the economy?”).

        Contemporary America is built on so many lies, one scarcely knows where to begin cataloguing them all.It is a lie that men and women are equal, it is a lie that all races are equal. It is a lie that a woman can be born trapped inside a man’s body. It is a lie that homosexuality is normal, let alone salutary. It is a lie that you have any “constitutional rights” if the government chooses to ignore them.One of the biggest lies of all is that the Jews are innocent and powerless victims instead of the richest and most powerful people in the country, and unless the FBI has the power to kick in your door at 3 a.m. and shoot your dog for being a “white supremacist” they will all be rounded up and packed on to cattle cars by American rednecks.

        The entire system now is predicated on the lie of equality. Since the basis of society is false, it is natural that even the peripheral aspects are blatant lies. Reality eventually wins out, whether through catastrophe or apathy, and perhaps in our case both.

            In the field of lying, the lie of equality might get the top prize.  All it takes is simply the ability to observe and draw conclusions to see that equality is impossible.  To get people to discard what they see is an amazing accomplishment.

        What I find most remarkable about this era of never ending lying is how few people don’t or refuse to see it.  They just lap up the slop like good little piggies.  Modern technology and medicine have simply allowed far too many stupid people to live and continue to spread their DF genes.  We’re well past the tipping point.

            The pace of events has increased exponentially since 2020.  It was hard to keep up from 2016 to 2020, so in some ways i don’t blame them.  I think its a self defense mechanism, they believe by giving up on keeping up they’ll save their sanity, not realizing by believing what you’re told instead of thinking, you join the insanity.

                So here is what I don’t understand. These pilots just think they are doing something good. In fact it goes to the whole point of the essay: people believe and do things thinking they are good; there is no other way to act or conclude.but if you believe total equality is good, then there is a Nazi around every bush because total equality is fake.  So believing error would do it.but I don’t think George Floyd and Ashley Babbitt were actors . There’s a limit to the human capacity to constantly lie.; or remember to lie or keep all the lies straight

Partly it’s innate stupidity a la “Idiocracy.” But partly it’s poor education, with very few schooled in classical logic and rhetoric.
Another point (not related to people unable to see through the fog of lies) is the poor quality of lies. It’s worthless slop, just bullsh!t of the lowest quality. The people telling them don’t have any brains or education either.

                “But partly it’s poor education, with very few schooled in classical logic and rhetoric.”Bingo.  However, it takes some intellect to do those things above and others not listed.  There is a reason why Lynn could find no functioning democracies where the national IQ was in the low 80’s.The USA, and now most other Western societies, is the first to reach “universal” suffrage.  Democracy in any other time—and this one too—requires more of the citizen than simply to fog a mirror in order to function properly.We need to redefine democracy to mean something other than universal suffrage.  The culling of the voter eligible population will be a good start.  Hell, even today a 66% turn out is greeted with thunderous applause.  My gut feeling is that half that number is more reasonable—that is to say, reasonably informed and educated for suffrage.

                    That’s probably an answer. A better answer would be if we could somehow put some things off-limits for being decided by vote. Like if there were a list of things that were agreed upon could be legitimately decided by “the nation”, another list that could be legitimately decided by “the state”, and at least some that are completely off-limits to anyone else’s say-so.
Then maybe write it down.
And then, anyone violates the terms gets tied by the ankles behind an ox and dragged for however long it takes.

            Something I’ve found very odd talking to Zoomers, is they seem wise to the grift/dishonesty/manipulation on social media (more so the tiktoks and snapchats etc that I’ve had almost no exposure to) but they still get swept up in it.For example they understand that someone’s notoriety is for the most part self-sustaining  after reaching critical mass without much actual basis in talent or insight, or they understand that people will start beefs and drama simply to create buzz and get a larger exposure, but then the Zoomers would come into work and tell me about the latest stuff as if it was important or the spat between two influencers had any meaning behind it.It’s like goldfish memory.

        I’ve always enjoyed this quote “Lie to a liar, for lies are his coin; steal from a thief, for that is easy; lay a trap for the trickster and catch him at the first attempt, but beware of an honest man”
Very few honest men these days which is why most are lying to, stealing from, or tricking someone…

        I probably shouldn’t be, but I’m still a little nonplussed about these “Republicans Against Trump” ads I see running everywhere. I can understand some former Trump supporters being disappointed in him at this point, but everyone in these commercials says the same thing – “I’m a former Trump voter, but I’m voting against him because [Democrat talking point of the day]”.  It is absolutely certain that none of these people has ever evenconsideredvoting Republican – must less voted for Trumptwice!  I’ve been trying to remember if I’ve seen anything like this in a prior campaign – an ad made up of nothing but people telling bald-face lies to the camera – and I admit I’ve drawn a blank.  I’m not even sure why they think listening to a bunch of liars is going to change anyone’s vote.  I’m wondering if it’s related to the Z-man’s talk of “narratives”.  They’ve told themselves stories about people abandoning Trump and they’re going to play act it being true in ads because even if they can’t find any of those people in their hearts they know they exist.

            Among D.C.-aligned Republicans and libertarians (partisan Democrats who think seeming Republican, independent, orotheris clever), from Reason to Ace Of Spades, the story since 2015 has been that Trump is a uniquely hated candidate who can never gain votes. By his very nature almost everyone rejects him, and each thing he says or does costs him the _______ vote hemayhave had if he did nothing, but now he’s lost it. Same story every day*.In real life the number of Trump voters who’ve converted to Democracy—absent debilitating insult to the brain—is exactly zero, so those characters have to be invented. They exista priori ex cathedra q.e.d.in the pronouncements of the elect, so their being fake in every instance is irrelevant.Of course there are ex Trump voters. Real people have been put off by his pandering to anti-whiteness,general ineffectuality,apparent submission to the Judeo-Pajeet-Homo Industrial Complex after he got shot, the increasing fakeness of elections, etc. But that’s not the story.*The alt right converted en masse to this story after January 6. “Anglin” has been getting especially emotional with it lately, giving himself away as an unreconstructed Reason/Cato/Kochfag. Or, one plays him every other day or so.

        I don’t think they target you just through your phone’s microphone, but also through your friend’s phone’s microphone. Case in point:I sing in a choir that performs a couple times a year. Once at one of our rehearsals, the director brought a female friend with her who sat in the bass section and sang bass. During a break, I remarked to a friend that I’d never heard a woman sing so low. My phone was in the car. The very next day, in my youtube feed was a video of the world record holder for lowest note sung by a female.

        While the internet is full of lying and fakery, at the same time it’s also also the enemy of regime-controlled TV and print media, because it’s where the truth can reach millions.  Discussions and analysis that run counter to what was the accepted narrative, such historical events (especially WWII), race differences, pointing out a small tribe with vast disproportionate power are now ubiquitous because of the internet.

I wonder if the cumulative total of the distributed discussion(s) is greater than the now purged concentrated ones. Moreover, those truths are openly discussed in the mainstream. In addition, they are undergirded and proven by the actions of The Regime. Reality is telling people the truth.

                What truths are these that are discussed in the mainstream?
The Internet gives the benefit of possibly finding some signal amongst the endless noise, compared with deliberate suppression of the truth in the official narrative.

                        Like gambling, all you can be fairly sure of is the one with all the flashing lights is the one intended to lure in the suckers.
Also like gambling, you can’t beat the house. The best you can do is walk away.

                            When the casino controls the money supply it’s very hard to walk away and most people won’t unless there is an alternative that is easy to transition too which at this point there is not, which is why I don’t think anyone strays off the casino until their money system collapses…

                                What passes for “news” is almost always fake and gay at best. One can still arrange his life such that pretty much the only news that matters is stuff from your own community. There’s no point to knowing the daily death count in Gaza, nor how close Russia is to nuking Ukraine.
It’s not like anyone says, “I see here the IDF rescued one of the hostages. That settles it. I’ll have the oven-roast chicken.”

            Unfortunately, the internet is now loaded with endless lies, even more than IRL, especially in the video format. Though it is certainly possible to lie in writing,  it is much easier to lie successfully in video than in writing.   It gets a lot of people to the point of saying “I don’t know what to believe,” which is probably good enough for our evil “leaders.”

        It is not even so much that we have moved away from truth, but that we are ruled over by people who do not believe in it. They believe, as they made quite explicitly in this “age of disinformation”, that truth is the opinion of the powerful, that they alone are the arbiters of reality and what they say goes. They also believe they can conjure up reality with their magic incantantations. “We will not go back” and “joy” appear to be the new ones, let’s see if they work. I would argue that, as long as these people are in charge, things will not change. This idea is central to their world view. And if their leadership means this country turns into a ruined, burning husk, they will simply go somewhere else.

That said, I can think of three or four other YouTube types with high six/low seven figure subscriber numbers that materialized out of nowhere, like Fraud…I mean Fridman.

                        Rogan was a real guy whose popularity was natural. He “took the ticket” very late, for the Spotify $100m—which they just had lying around, as zero-revenue companies often do.
They showed us who owned him when they had him make an abject public apology for saying he’d heard rumors that some Seattle/Portland-area forest fires were started by antifa-lookin’ guys. (Remember that?) They made him grovel like he’d been caught fingering a baby.

        It is jarring to hear Z Man describe the Athenians as promiscuous liars because I was taught that they laid the foundations of the West. That’s okay; I have a deep desire to know the truth and don’t mind reexamining my beliefs.
I ask myself, “Was Aristotle a liar?” I think his observations about human affairs and his taxonomies of the natural world and logic were foundational, even if he got some things wrong.
Then I recall that Z Man suggested Aristotle as “history’s greatest monster.”https://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=29113

            The reason Athens had so many great philosophers is they had a great need for truth telling as an antidote to their culture of lying. The Achaemenid Empire did not produce great philosophers, because they treated lying as a capital crime. The philosopher is the reaction to the sophist and the culture that venerates him.

                Folks need only read the dialogues of Socrates to illustrate the great insight Z-man shows above.  Socrates was convicted and condemned on charges of corrupting the youth and impiety.
As Socrates put it when explaining why he was awaiting trial to his friend, Euthyphro, “They say I am accused of making the stronger argument look weak, and the weaker argument seem strong…”. Using Z-man’s terminology in today’s missive, he (Socrates) called the liars out for their lies, while embarrassing them as well.
Well done Z-man, I might add.

                    Aristophanes was an Athenian playwright and his comedies are hilarious. For example, in the Assemblywomen, the women take over the government and they decree that attractive men must make love to ugly women.
The Clouds was his take on the sophists. In the play, Socrates was their leader, not their critic, who sits in a basket, gazing at the sky.&amp;nbsp
Plato said that Aristophanes’ caricature of Socrates contributed to his prosecution. Aristophanes was a popular guy, so maybe he was part of the in crowd that disliked Socrates for being truthful.

        The elites have been lying to their citizens since the beginning of time. The difference then was if things got out of hand and became unbearable, people could go somewhere else and get on with their lives. Not saying it was easy, but it was possible.
Unfortunately in a digital age there’s no way to get away from their lies and go somewhere else. Everything they do affects every aspect of our lives (e.g. banking, travel, property ownership, retirement, etc.) no matter where we go.

        When I was still teaching, I used to raise eyebrows when I would calmly state that, whether it be a child or the parent, “I just assume from the beginning that everyone is lying to me.”  Kids lie about pretty much everything, not so much to gain advantage, but to protect themselves.  Parents lie to gain advantage, sympathy or to avoid accountability.  Administrators lie because it’s in their job description.  Teachers lie to spare feelings, avoid accountability, or avoid admitting how they’re just glorified babysitters for 80% of students.I moved back into corporate America, and this model has served me well.  That employee doesn’t want to “catch up”.  They want to ask for more money.  The customer messed something up, and no it’s not really my employee’s fault.  And yes, you do owe me money.  Etc etcThe weird thing about the liars culture is that you still need a baseline of truth.  The truth never diminishes.  There is a price the dealer cannot go below without paying you to buy the thing.  The parents know, even when they don’t admit it, that they’re bad parents who rely on electric babysitters, and now their kid is a wreck because the electric babysitter doesn’t have boundaries.  The employee knows he doesn’t deserve a raise, and I know that salaries come out of a checking account, not a credit card, so I can’t just pay “whatever”.I let a black guy go recently.  He made a zillion promises, never delivered, and his team had to keep covering down on requirements to get the work done.  They finally popped, and it was him or them.  My company is terrified they’re going to get sued.  The black guy probably has no idea he can’t do the job because his work model involves other people actually doing the work.  More lies.

        “Greek philosophy is the result of this culture that prized lying above all other virtues.”
Surely you mean Greek rhetoric? Greek rhetoric and Greek philosophy were at daggers drawn. Rhetoric has continued to be taught in good schools and universities until today, usually as part of the Trivium.

            Greek rhetoric and Greek philosophy were at daggers drawn.
Just recently I encountered the claim that Aristotle was motivated to writePrior Analytics(akaConcerning Syllogisms) to fight the Sophists. The latter were sometimes hired by ambitious citizens who aspired to political careers. See p. 73 ofLogic Made Easyby Deborah Bennett, a maths instructor at New Jersey City U at the time of publication (2004). She adds that “Aristotle recognized three figures”. Galen added a fourth more than 300 yrs later.

            Sadly, rhetoric has entirely taken over any public discussions about any topic.  It is in ALL news reports. It’s in ALL political discussions.  It is in pretty much all cultural discussions.  In fact, I would say the rhetorical nature of our public discussions is what makes them propaganda.  They are ALWAYS trying to convince of you of something rather than to inform you with just the facts.“Our Democracy” works in the exact opposite way one would think it would work.  Citizens are not informed of issues and then expected to weigh them and vote intelligently for how to manage them.  Instead, we are propgandized to support whatever it is they want to do.

                “Sadly, rhetoric has entirely taken over any public discussions about any topic.”What’s produced in the US isn’t rhetoric. Rhetoric is a sophisticated thing, with a lot of technical tools. US propaganda and disinformation is a creature of another stripe. It too has technical tools but not the same. One of the many differences is the mode in which each is conveyed — in the first a speaker is addressing either you alone or you as part of a group and is using his voice. In the latter case it’s typically print or televisual in nature. You don’t who’s behind it and it’s difficult to ascertain who it’s meant for. And it depends more on mindless repetition. To my mind rhetoric is more attractive — it has to be witty, entertaining, and charming. Today’s propaganda and disinformation typically is not.

Correct. In the Apology, Socrates is accused by Meletus, Anytus, and Lycon, who represent the orators, the poets, and the politicians.

            On what basis do you figure that connivance is a healthy strategy? Your enemies have been putting notches in their belts to record victories over people who are habitually self-deceived, habitually hostile to humility (which makes them too confident in their beliefs), habitually eager to repeat their delusions with supreme confidence, and habitually willing to tell lies of their own.

            I wonder if they produced proportionally as much crap as “we” do, but it just didn’t survive to today. It’s a given that hundreds of years from now, artists who are unknown right now will be lauded as the great artists of this era.Thanks to the interwebs, you can easily look up the top 40 songs from any week in the distant past and listen to them. You’ll find that it was full of forgettable schlock, and it’s only the really good songs that survived to become classics that create the impression that music used to be better. Which it was, but maybe not as better as you might think.

                Hah, speak of the devil.  Emil Kierkegaard has a posting a day or so ago;https://open.substack.com/pub/kirkegaard/p/is-language-dumbing-down?r=17xj86&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=emailwhich attempts to measure societal decline in verbal ability, i.e, language.  We’ve all discussed general intelligence decline, so why would not verbal ability decline with such as well?One of the articles cited attempted to measure decline through “music compression” over time!  Seems music made in the recent era is subject to greater compression that music was a decade or two ago.  This is attributed to the lack of complexity in the lyrics of newer music.  If you simply repeat the same refrain over and over, you get better compression from the algorithm.  Quite amusing.  I guess in a century we’ll have to settle for sitting around and grunting at each other like Grok and Grog from the classic animated television series “The Gogs.”  😉

                    The same is true in the music itself. From time to time I’ll encounter a Zoomer who can’t stop talking about some song where things drift from side to side in the speaker/headphones, and after a quick listen, I tell him, “Welcome to the ’70s. Check out Queen or Boomtown Rats or the Stones or Moody Blues or CCR or Zep or Rush or Floyd or even someone as mainstream as Carly Simon.”
Things pretty much got flattened to mono in the ’90s, along with Autotuned, so it is cool to see music getting more complex again.

                        Don’t know how I forgot this, but in some of the Boston tracks, each tom is panned differently. Some songs it sounds like each guitar string is panned differently, but it’s because they did (at least) 6 takes and blended each take differently across the stereo stage.
It would be great to see what they could do with a modern DAW and recording equipment.

                            A great example is Amanda. Put headphones on, close your eyes, and you can picture where everyone is on stage. But then the drummer bounces all over the place because of the way his toms are panned. The complexity makes your brain work to process what it’s hearing. That vanished in the ’90s, and it’s now being rediscovered.

        This piece from March in The Atlantic seems relevant:Of Course America Fell for Liquid DeathHow is a company that sells canned water worth $1.4 billion?When you think about it, the business of bottled water is pretty odd. What other industry produces billions in revenue selling something that almost everyone in America—with somenotable and appalling exceptions—can get basically for free?Almost every brand claims in one way or another to be the purest or best-tasting or most luxurious, but very little distinguishes Poland Spring from Aquafina or Dasani or Evian. And then there is Liquid Death. The company sells its water in tallboy cans branded with its over-the-top name, more over-the-top melting-skull logo, andeven moreover-the-top slogan: “Murder your thirst.”More:https://archive.is/ef7nb#selection-771.0-779.43

            Not sure of the influence here, but I’m addicted to watching YouTube videos of Europeans, and other nationalities, visiting American and giving their initial impressions of us.  Of course, the first is that we are fat!  The second is often the portion size in food servings along with huge, refillable, soft drinks.  Third quite often seems to be tap water.  Not a single European can understand why we would drink such.  They, for historical reasons I guess, use tap water only for washing.  They buy bottled water for drinking.
Could we be seeing the influence of our new cultural diversity?

                Back in grad school I had a Jap roommate one semester. So, we go out to grab a bite for dinner and I order the ribs. He got a salad or some such. They wheel my rack o’ ribs out and I commence to chowing down. I glance up and Toshiki’s eyes are as big around as silver dollars. I ask him what’s the matter. He says in a shaky, awe-struck voice, “Are you really gonna eat all that? If my mom made that, it would be for the whole family!”I’m not a tubber and never have been, but there is no doubt Americans are and long have been, shall we say, ravenous consumers of various and sundry.I have noticed, however, that even Orientals aren’t immune after living in this country. To wit, east Asian girls fresh off the boat are skinny as rails and have the figure of an ironing board. However, east Asian girls who were born here fill out and become voluptuous just like white girls. They look healthier that way, but probably aren’t.

                    It’s the environment, almost certainly the diet. Full-blooded Japanese, Chinese, Indian, etc. come to America, UK, whatever and those born in the new land, if they adopt the local diet, tend to get the same health problems at the same rates as locals. Usually (but, perhaps not always) their health overall is worse than the kin who stayed in the old country.

        This empire built on lies cannot stand for very much longer.  Many (a majority?) Americans and Europeans I believe are beginning to adopt the attitude of Soviet citizens back in the day concerning the lies coming from the “leaders”:
они делают вид, что говорят нам правду, а мы делаем вид, что им верим

            My favorite was the play on words,
“There is no truth in Pravda, and there is no news in Izvestia.”
In Russian, Pravda means “Truth,” and Izvestia means “News.”

        In a hyper-financialized economy, where everyone is almost required to spend their money or “invest” it as fast as possible, the lies and deception are accelerated by an order of magnitude. When every moment you keep your money becomes a loss due to inflation, you’re frantically looking for the “least crooked” vendor.
Add this is our election process, where every four years is the possibility for society to be upended, and you’re going to get hucksters, as there’s no way to vet all the new people entering the political field.

                            Maybe, but there was no *need* to print money. It’s not like Trump backed off on the money printing. And chowderheads of all stripes were cheering low interest rates as if capital destruction and wiping out savings were a good thing for society.
The Treasury already had phenomenally good terms on their bonds, being able to sell them at or even above face value. Why upset the apple cart?

                                Because the economy began to blow up again late 2018, continued thru 2019 and went into crisis mode beginning of 2020.  They were already QEing in 2019, you just didn’t know it.  It couldn’t handle rates of 2.5 without printing.  Only reason we’re at 5.25 now is because of all the printing in 2020 plus they’re still running a deficit of over a trillion dollars a year.  Those were considered catastrophic in 2008.

                                    Define “blow up”.
Despite all the “money printer go brrr” going on, the Fed couldn’t cause inflation. There was too much growth, too little unemployment, even if a good share of growth was unhealthy and unsustainable. The lower cost of energy in particular was a “problem” to the central bank and the government, who saw they were going to have to pay debts with deflated money.
Very cunning people sold that as “blowing up”, and most people bought it. It was lies all the way down.

                                        In stopped clock fashion, the Dems had the right answer to that, if for the wrong reason. The Donald wanted even lower interest rates, like Obama had, because the higher rates made him look bad to people with a feeble grasp of how the economy works. The Dems opposed it not on any principle other than opposition to whatever The Donald wanted.

                            Italy didn’t start lockdowns months ahead of the curve because of, or as a consequence of the outcome of American elections.Loads of countries didn’t continue with those policies for years afterwards because of the American elections. China certainly didn’t.
You can say the American election rules (like mail-in) were fudged as a consequence of the virus business, but I wouldn’t really call that upending society, not to mention the virus was just a convenient excuse.
And they hardly need an excuse to print more money, just like raising the debt ceiling etc. any excuse will do, if that.

        As Z touches upon, the Mendacity Motive applies to capitalism, too. Telling the truth about one’s good or service is very far down the list of priorities. The only true objective is to sell that good or service for the highest price possible. And lying may achieve that objective more surely than honesty.And this is why living in a capitalist economy is so tiresome. In anything of significant value you purchase, you have to be on the lookout for for fraud. Not only can we not trust politicians, “journalists,” and professors, we can’t trust the guy who’s fixing our brake light, or the corporation that’s selling us a salami. Being watchful and suspicious all the time is draining, but if you don’t do it, you’ll be taken to the cleaners, sure as shootin’. Everything’s a dam’ racket.

            That is certainly true of a one-shot, just as it is in Prisoner’s Dilemma. The key is in engineering it into being an iterated interaction.
EBay and Amazon and Temu and so on don’t have the return and refund policies they have because it’s good for a one-shot, but because it’s the best answer to repeat business.

            Unfortunately, when we get old, we get “stupid”.  Cognitive facilities decline and we become too trustful in old age.  I get most of my phone calls these days promoting scams designed for “old” people.  Wife yells at me for playing along, but hell I’m bored so I play along until I get the gist of the scam.I’ve even known folk who’ve been taken in by the proverbial “Nigerian Prince” fraud who seemed absolutely competent in every other aspect of life.  Interestingly, in this case, the failure to be suspicious preceded the onset of Alzheimer’s diagnosis by about 6 years.There really needs to be a special place in hell for these conmen.  Fortunately, say what you will, the banks here seem to show good judgement wrt these frauds.  I had to convert some large sums of money into cashier’s checks a few months ago and the bank had a wonderful middle aged lady come from the “back room” and chat with me.  She was a pro.We had a good laugh together, I’m usually a real prick when you treat me like a child or ask about “private” matters, but she was as disarming as one could be.  I then asked her, how many of these attempted frauds do you intercept?  She responded, “At this branch about 5-6 a week!”  Folks, we’re talking about literally 10’s to 100’s of thousands at just her branch!It sucks to get old…

                    In the present “great society” we’ve made for ourselves, cancer is not the big killer—it’s age and loneliness!  Such has not arrived yet for us lucky few.
“…When Croesus asked Solon who the happiest person was, expecting Solon to name him due to his immense wealth and power, Solon instead explained that true happiness can only be judged after a person’s life is complete, and all its trials and tribulations have been experienced…”
Really, the older I get the more I realize there is nothing new under the sun—that especially applies to wisdom.

Remember when, “nudging”, replaced psychological manipulation and lying?As for that “news” story, remember what the names of people on, “news” stories used to look and sound like? The bots will replace them soon enough, but still. You can see that importation and replacement has become the highest priority now that lying has long since been cemented as standard operating procedure.

        I do take exception to your crack about Kamala’s “day-drinking.” If someone can efficiently wrap things up and quickly get to the real work of the day — namely, drinking — then more power to them.I do not advocate morning drinking but everyone knows afternoons are useless, anything not happening by lunchtime is simply not going to happen, any momentum totally lost as Debbie from Accounting takes everyone’s orders for Chinese or Panera. May as well just knock off, relax and smell the Four Roses, or Genny Creams as the case may bePlus you get into a lot less trouble drinking in bright crisp daylight than staggering around all night in dark seedy bars and trendy bottle clubs. I’ve always advocated that people go out partying by mid-afternoon and be safely home before drive-by-shooting time at your local dining and entertainment district

        I don’t think lies in and of themselves are all that effective. Twain wrote on Huckleberry Finn that the Royal Nonesuch got the King and Duke tarred and feathered. Rather, it is lies plus patronage that tends to keep those in power, in power.When the Berlin Wall fell, it fell in large part because the border guards had not been paid in three years (1986 being their last payday). When the Soviet Union fell, the military had similarly not been paid for three years and the security services had not been paid in two years.The Athenians had lots of small farmers who could not compete with big ones using slave labor (sound familiar) and were paid rowers to keep them occupied. Since war meant a pay day, they were always in favor of war. Until the odds turned against them and they faced death or capture/enslavement. Then they were not in favor of war. All the lies in the world could not keep up the Soviet Union or East Germany. The Chinese lie very, very much. But they also keep the Army paid well, and the people generally with improving lives, such as possible in their system.The US/European post-War system was based on good material living standards so that the people would not go Communist. It was that simple. It was the patronage not the lies that kept people in check. This was what Napoleon, Alexander, and Caesar all knew. Ad did Wallenstein.Lies alone lead to the situation of the King and Duke. At some point, leaders must reward either a brutal inner circle whose loyalty must be continually ascertained and re-inforced (i.e. frequent and awful purges see Stalin, Mao, the Kims) or some sort of general patronage to the people and various cadres/nobility dispersed in a modified Palace Economy.Look at Bud Light. As soon as they went full troon, the sales took a huge hit as the only reason people bought the stuff was the amusing advertising. Same with Disney and Marvel/Star Wars. No one wants their drag brunch stuff (“Agatha All Along” has been described by the show runner as appealing only to that group — can’t make that stuff up).

            I recall that it was one year the Soviet military didn’t get paid before it fell apart. Not to quibble, that’s not what I’m getting at, because either way, the point is the regime can survive an economic collapse, for a while. But not forever. Of course in AINO, where money is valued above all, it might take less time.

                I don’t think it’s possible to compare economic collapse between the USSR and potentially, the USA.  The economy of Russia was run completely and totally from the central government.  Collapse may happen, but it will take a different form to be certain.

                    Agree. I like to pretend I’m more or less ready for a rapid collapse that sends the ferals out ravaging the countryside, but I think a much more gradual “end” is in the offing. Not because our betters care about us, but rather, worst case, as I run the numbers, the fuel runs out before the food. Out of fuel vehicles clogging the roads, ferals not able to figure out how to get fuel out of the few underground tanks that still have any, etc. Not to mention that ferals are similar stock as Haitians, so long pork is an option.They relieve their “neighbors” of the “burden of ownership” of comestibles, and delay their rural pillaging until too late. Most likely dying in place or nearby, but even if not, giving us enough time to barricade the bridges.

                    I’d not heard the Soviet lack of payment. It really doesn’t speak well of a government when it can’t even print up fiat money to pay its own employees. Shortages of ink? Paper? Lack of record keeping or banking systems? Curious to find out.

            It’s been a long time since I readHuckleberry Finn, but my recollection is that the King and the Duke didn’t get tarred and feathered.  They left town before the last show, knowing that the townsfolk were preparing to tar and feather them.

        “It has reached the point where it is expected, so that an honest appeal feels inauthentic.”Disagree. In a society where everybody lies, Trump stands out because of his authentic moments, moments where he is telling the truth. Trump also lies or conveniently glosses over inconvenient details, but he’s also quite frequently honest. It makes an impression.“It is how America has become the New Athens.”Don’t forget about homosexuality being such a fad in elite circles. That said, Athens was a fairly minor city as of the mid 1800s. It was said to have a majority Albanian population at the time.

        The West is a lair’s culture now, where only the naivest trust anyone or anything.Yes, now, but when has it been otherwise? Parents have been telling their children variants of the Santa Claus myth for centuries. Because it’s so much fun to deceive children, and the kids love it!The USA’s Constitution begins with a whopper. Article VII pretends to tell you the law of “Ratification” and “Establishment” before both of these. To protect this abomination the USA has built one of the most aggressive militaries in human history, and she menaces billions with nuclear annihilation should they dare to resist.Globohomo’s creationist declaration of “Separation” (last word of 1st paragraph,1823 facsimile) is larded with misleading assertions. Bear in mind that the author, editors, and signers may well have believed some the DoI’s sophistries.Jesus of Nazareth is supposed to have been, and still to be, an incarnation of a god. Yet while dying on his cross, he cried out “eli, eli, lema sabachthani?”. How could a guy who is one in being with the elohim of Genesis 1 have been abandoned without being separated from his elohim? Was Jesus delusional about a separation but saying what he believed to be true? Was he not separated from his so-called Father but dissembling? Was he never one in being with a god? None of these options is flattering to Jesus or to the stupid, arrogant people of a vile civilization which is most responsible for spreading his cult in Evrope and later worldwide.The West’s war on truth is ancient and borrows heavily from a war on truth which began before the appearance of the West (not to be confused with classical civ of Greece and Rome). This civilization of lies is also a civilization of delusion and reckless disregard for truth. It’s been evil since the beginning.

            Probably stupid to feed the trolls, but since I’d rather you repent than die in sin, “sabachthani” almost certainly means “left” or “withdrawn”, not “abandoned”. As God, He could not die. Not much of a sacrifice if His divine nature couldn’t die, and could suspend the suffering at any point He’d had enough. The only way He could be “fully man”, and thus the ultimate sacrifice, is to withdraw His divine aspect and be said to have “descended into the dead”.
I have some quibbles, but you could at least pretend to have read the theology.

                Incidentally, He says a bit earlier that He could call upon His Father and He would have a legion of angels. If that’s the case, wouldn’t willingly giving up that option and becoming obedient unto death feel something like that power had left Him?
