        ‚ÄúHonor is an individual characteristic. It is something you give yourself through your own decisions. Similarly, the virtue of the man willing to sacrifice for the good of the institution is largely an individual creation.‚Äù This explains why ‚Äúvirtue signaling‚Äù so perfectly defines what progressives do, and why the term pisses them off. It shows that what they‚Äôre doing is a performance with no real meaning or worth. If the old cliche about ‚Äúcharacter is what you do when no one‚Äôs watching‚Äù holds up, the progressive version would be, ‚ÄúCompassion is what you pretend to have when the person you pretend to care about is far different from you, and other white weirdos like you are watching the performance.‚Äù Honor is in individual deeds, which is why they‚Äôre so mob-oriented, and why there is no limiting principle for them, since they‚Äôre doing nothing but chasing a (dopamine) high. They went from gay rights to transsexualism for the same reason someone goes from brown tar to fentanyl. They needed a bigger hit.

            Dead.  Solid.  Perfect. Find it ironic that the same ones leading the local virtue signaling mobs in my little burg are the same ones that the moment they are no longer childless abandon their previous vibrant neighborhoods in the city and decamp here.  Or several years ago, when the poor, vibrant city next door wanted to develop an abandoned industrial area into shopping went batshit because the traffic would ‚Äúdestroy their quality of life‚Äù, mobbed town meetings, filed lawsuits.  Same people are now taking knees and worshipping our new vibrant overlords. I will enjoy it when the mobs come for them.

            Agree that much virtue signalling and similar is just empty, feel-good theater. This is exactly what Jesus preached against in his teaching (I‚Äôm probably paraphrasing so don‚Äôt jump on me!): ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do things publicly for praise by the crowd, as the Pharisees do. Praise is the only reward that they will get. Instead do good in secret and God who sees all things will reward you.‚Äù I won‚Äôt revisit my morality essay of a few days ago üôÇ but: I think the most important morality is the individual‚Äôs. Certainly approval of a group can be important; in many cases the group can serve a useful function to the individual (or to protect the group), in encouraging certain conduct while discouraging others. The Jesus story, that is an example of worthless public adulation. Virtue-signalling in so many words

            I wish we could convince more of these people to go for the biggest hit of all and just kill themselves.  It‚Äôs too bad most don‚Äôt have the guts and they manifest their longing for death by encouraging mobs to burn things.  It‚Äôs a sort of ‚Äúsuicide by PoC‚Äù if you will.

        The phase that we are going through right now is sad and dangerous, but necessary. Normies have to realize that the old America is dead before we can start to build something new. This is very hard, because it‚Äôs patriotism and loyalty that keep the normies trying, and these are genuine virtues not to be discouraged by any movement of the Right. But just as loyalty to your parents does not include stuffing their dead bodies and pretending that they are alive, loyalty to country does not include pretending that we‚Äôre still living in the United States.The battle for the United States is over, but the battle for America is just beginning. Start building from the bottom up, right now, where you are, with what you have. As Peter Brimalow once said,  It‚Äôs going to be a big wreck, with lots to salvage.

            This new front in the race wars is useful. The capitulation of CivNat types changes the game. In just two weeks, CivNats have gone from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see color‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all just Americans‚Äù to ‚Äúracism and systemic injustice are real and we whites need to listen to the black community.‚ÄùThe center has broken. There is no resistance to a full assault on whites.Now that CivNats have admitted their guilt (whether they believe it or not, they‚Äôre saying it publicly), Progressives and non-whites will demand more action, more groveling by whites to atone for their sin of racism. Sadly, there will be whites who willingly grovel.However, we can recruit those whites who are beginning to realize that there will never be a truce in this war, that they will never be left alone. We need to recruit the whites who are waking up to the fact that they won‚Äôt be able to just hide and live their lives. The Progressive whites and their brown horde will come for them and demand money and fealty.Soon, very soon, whites will be required to sign confessions of their guilt. A perfect example is the Boy Scouts now requiring kids trying to reach Eagle Scout to get a diversity and inclusion merit badge. Anyone who has a job requiring certification and continuing ed credits will need to have Diversity and Inclusion credits just as you need an Ethics course. And guess what, you don‚Äôt get your credits unless you agree to everything in the course.This will happen everywhere. Whites will be required to publicly acknowledge their racism and their willingness to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to non-white communities. Naturally, this will go along with more tangible punishments such as a wealth tax, housing programs, etc.But my guess is that it will be the mental degradations that will cause the most anger in whites. What‚Äôs more, wealthy whites won‚Äôt be able to buy their way out of those.At first, I was depressed by the past few weeks and the collapse of so many whites, but I now see it as a needed push. We need enough pressure on whites to get them to move. They need to see that it‚Äôs not 1965. We‚Äôre not the overwhelming majority of the population holding all the power, and thus can brush aside progressives and blacks. Whites need the slap in the face to wake them up, and it‚Äôs coming. Most will just take it, but many will decide the future for them and their children as a hated minority isn‚Äôt worth the current humiliation.

                Agreed, some whites will collaborate, but once they see that there is no way out, that collaboration will not save them, that, as Anti-Gnostic once said ‚ÄúYou skin is your uniform in this war‚Äù, they will start to come over. As for what Mr. Kentwood said, I wouldn‚Äôt put too much stock in what people are saying right now, 90% of this is just cheap virtue signalling, with no cost ‚Äì yet. When the Vibrancy starts burning their McMansions, we‚Äôll see.

                    I hope you guys are right, that a revolution might turn back the clock. But sadly the demographics are against us. Over a period of many decades, I think we (and other countries) will see the gradual waning of perceived white power structures. I don‚Äôt know about signing pledges, but certaily a continued erosion of gun rights, school and property choices, etc. Us whites, or even going back 2-3 generations, have had a hand in this. We ‚Äúlost‚Äù the right to segregate our neighborhoods and schools in the late 1940s, 1950s. The 1964 Civil Rights Act chipped away what little remained of Jim Crow The 1965 immigration changes‚Ä¶ All this when our country was 90% White! Blame the Jews, really??? Sure, we had our affluent suburbs and exurbs but those are slowly getting Vibrant. Hard to see how we get out of this mess. Despite occasional arguments along these lines, I just don‚Äôt see the Vibrants coming to us crawling, saying ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave White people! Save us from the Hell that we‚Äôve created!‚Äù üôÅ

            You are not going to vote your way out of what‚Äôs coming Dave.  You know this.Nor is Trump going to come into your family and bitch slap some sense into Karen. That‚Äôs your job. Given that Karen is now protected by the state‚Ä¶good luck with that. She needs you now like a fish needs a bicycle. There is a reason that most mythologies have Karen in starring roles like that of Eve and Pandora.Guys like us are going to have to run down our women and joggers and put them back on the leash.

                    I agree with the ‚Äúlet it burn‚Äù attitude for areas that brought this upon themselves.  As you say, if the strategy is let it burn, then tell them that is the strategy.  This ‚Äúman up or else I will‚Äù followed by nothing, makes Trump look impotent.  Better to say nothing, or even better to say ‚Äúyou voted for this mess, you fix it.  We‚Äôre not bailing you out.‚Äù

                    Trump will shoot his face off, but he will put a crisis to good use too. The blue city states are getting what they voted for, good and hard. They are literally burned out smoldering shit holes. Whitey is packing up and moving out. All these corps that are so sympathetic to BLM are pulling up stakes and quietly doing the same. Contrary to us ‚Äì Trump has nothing to lose by sitting on his hands and watching Seattle burn. Even Leftie can‚Äôt argue about who is responsible for it, and Normie is starting to flirt with the red pill.If I had to issue orders, mine would be to stand down, stay alert, enjoy your beer and popcorn‚Ä¶ and keep your rifle and sidearm close at hand. The reason this is all getting so ridiculous is that Leftie is getting desperate. At some point he either has to surrender or do something REALLY rash and stupid‚Ä¶ and then it‚Äôs payback time.

                        It is extremely frustrating to watch Trump make what seem like idle threats but I tend to think that, mathematically his ‚Äúlet it burn‚Äù strategy does make sense.  Consider two possible strategies here:The Iron Fist:Trump invokes the Insurrection Act and sends in Federal Troops, CHAZ or CHOP or whatever it‚Äôs called now is crushed, order is restored by force.  Results: By November, liberal whites have forgotten that it was THEIR OWN lefty mayors and governors who first destroyed their economy with lockdowns and then let their cities burn.  Additionally the media has installed a new narrative ‚Äì Trump REALLY IS Hitler!  See, he sends in troops to crush peaceful people just trying to have a groovy weed fueled festival of communal living, skanky sex, and vegan hamburgers.  Maybe people on Facebook start passing around a picture of tank idling next to an old man with a BLM sign.  Biden support goes up slightly.  Meanwhile, in the countryside and suburbs, his white supporters see him as basically just doing his job.  Support for Trump solidifies but does not increase much.Let it Burn:Eventually the inner cities in the Blue states are pretty much totally burned over.  If things get really out of control some of the Cloud people see their nice white neighborhoods and boutiques burn.  Starvation, disease, and drug overdoses eventually lead the CHAZians to come out begging to be arrested so they can get some clean water and food.  Results: Urban Blue populations are thoroughly demoralized and the only blame they can place on Trump is for not being their granddad‚Äôs Hitler.  Lefties start talking openly about Biden‚Äôs mental state.  Support for Biden goes from lukewarm to ice bath.  Support for local libshit mayors and governors basically vanishes.  A few of the less committed Lefties even defect to Trump and vote for Republican challengers for state and local offices in November.  Meanwhile, suburban and rural whites who were already going to vote for Trump have become much more fired up seeing just what kind of people his enemies are and the kind of chaos they create.  Karens still share their pro-BLM stuff on Facebook but are secretly terrified for their safety.  They either don‚Äôt vote or secretly vote for Trump.The mathematical angle is this.  Divide the voters into two basic groups, Biden-leaning and Trump-leaning, call them B and T, respectively.  American elections tend to be close so B and T are roughly the same size.  InThe Iron Fist, B goes up slightly, T stays about the same or maybe rises a bit.  The result is too close to call but probably B &gt; T.  Biden win by a hair.  InLet it Burn, B goes down a lot, T goes up a lot, T &gt;&gt; B, Trump win in a landslide.

                                Yeah, but the non-interference in State responsibilities has already been blow with his EO‚Äôs and Congressional Bills designed to rein in local law enforcement (really pander to the joggers)‚Äîban choke holds, create data base for bad cops, restrict/strip immunity, standardized police training and certify such at the Federal level, etc.
This action is nothing less than an usurpation of a Constitutional power reserved to the States.  If it passes, it will be as drastic a blow to States‚Äô Rights as when the Fed‚Äôs took over the State militias, now know as National Guard.  Trump‚Äôs action is neither libertarian nor conservative.

                The old are stunned, dumfounded by the new, thus the title. The non-traditional new ways of doing things have a paralyzing effect on the old. The old men in the novel don‚Äôt understand the new world that is being created. Thus the choice of weapon used by the killer is symbolic of the book as a whole. Just as the Antifa/BLM axis leaves most frozen in place as to how to handle this new apparition rearing its head. The melanin-worshippers must experience some vague fear of unattainment at the same time hoping that somehow their current expiation will be the last time. If only.The Antifa/BLM axis is highly unstable however. NT‚Ä¶ J will tear it apart. The ranks of BLM are highly vulnerable &amp; suggestible to conspiracy theories so the Proto-calls and its ilk can always be invoked to create division among them. The response among tribe will be to shut it down, and they control the media.

            ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù is an anti-white slur designed to humiliate and denigrate normal white women.  Nobody on the right, let alone our side of the right should be using it.It is so nakedly anti-white.  I really don‚Äôt understand why I see so many conservatives using it and even a lot of people on our side of the divide.  The women being slurred with it are all white and most of them are normal.  Example, that woman in Central Park. She had EVERY RIGHT to be fearful with that young black guy.This anti-white slur is disgusting.

                    The ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù thing started when a white woman called the police on a bunch of blacks ignoring the law and barbecuing in a park that had rules against barbecuing with an open flame.   But rules don‚Äôt apply to blacks.  Another early ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù was a woman refusing to admit a black man following into her apartment building despite the rules and signs saying you weren‚Äôt allowed to do it.  Woman lost her job and was kicked out of the apartment complex.These were fairly normal white women trying to follow the rules. Civilization requires we follow the rules.

The last one I heard was a white woman who questioned someone making a giant black lives matter sign outside of her house next door. Most of them have been about not deferring to random black people.

Fully agree, but why should you care? It‚Äôs not your job to protect them. Even in a more sane society with far more cemented, traditional gender norms it still wouldn‚Äôt be your job to do so.

                        Agree with the dissenters. Of any large group, even our hypothetical united whites, there will be the normal variations. This is equally true of all large groups of humans.Judged by any valid standard (not one that is made of rubber and twisted to suit the needs of the moment), there will always be some who are above average, most in the middle, and some of low quality. Our race may be blessed with a better IQ bell curve than most, but a moral Bell curve would still have many losers on the left side who are as much of a threat, if not more, to civilization than whatever non-White bogeyman a paranoid mind can imagine.

                Women on our side , hell all White women have an obligation to not be a bunch of entitled bitches.What they need to be is a decent human being, a wife and a mother and yes its in our culture, themselves too. Hell be brave. Its in our women.The ones that act like little Stazi snitches or call the cops over bull crap  deserve all the hate.And for the record, this isn‚Äôt new. When I was a young teen in Arizona , one of these little shits called the cops on me for my complexly legal fake nunchaku. The cops of course would not tell me who the snitch was and took my sticksTaught me two good lessons, cops suck and Karens male and female are out there.And your complain mt, do  some women get name called unfairly? Yes. That sucks. Most though deserve all the derision we can muster.

                    I too was a rebellious teen, although my violations didn‚Äôt run to weapons. In defense of the law, you‚Äôd be amazed, or dismayed, how many people (usually young men) who have been killed because they had a replica gun. In fact, people can be (and have been) convicted of armed robbery with a fake gun. Ideally there‚Äôd be better education for teens, but yeah, largely wasted effort, even with the white ones üôÇ

                        Common sense and common law indicates that we go easy on the young dumb teens when the actions aren‚Äôt extremely serious.We fail to do this because our society is dysfunctional and because we have trouble admiring that different groups have different maturation rates and different intents.A fix though requires an authoritarian Right regime that will make sure that  there are stable jobs and stable families and probably a rational moral teaching at every level.Not easy.

            I never grasped that concept, no country for old men, until recently.I sit around looking at the place around me and realize this is not a place where I can get old in.  It just isn‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs not safe, I always have to be on guard, etc.I will have to live with it I guess.  Although it is not what I envisioned as a young man.   I imagined getting old in a place much nicer.Oh well.

            Donald the Trump has been particularly uninspiring lately. Words are his kind of action. In his term so far he has pretty much limited himself to his own brand of conservative virtue signaling, while doing nothing to enable it. Remember his declaration about ending birthright citizenship? A lollipop for his followers. If any such plan exists, it‚Äôs on the highest shelf in the attic.As Israel‚Äôs ambassador to the United States, Rabbi Trump has recruited Rabbi Kushner as the power in front of the throne while he blisses out on what he likes best, speaking at rallies.I‚Äôll vote for him in November in an abyss of distaste, because I couldn‚Äôt stand thinking that anything I did ‚Äî even passively, like staying away from the election entirely ‚Äî helped open the gates for the dementia candidate and his veep qualified for office by proper skin tone and anti-white bona fides.Whether he is re-elected or not, ‚ÄúIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.‚Äù

        ‚ÄúYou can lose your job for refusing to use the right pronouns, for example.‚ÄùThat actually happened to me last year. Academic job.It was actually a terrible, low-paying job, and they were trying to get rid of me before that for purely political reasons but couldn‚Äôt because I was competent. So that was the pretext they ended up using.It wasn‚Äôt intentional, by the way. Purely innocent mistake. Some ‚Äútransgender‚Äù looked like a male, so I addressed ‚Äúhim‚Äù as such. I had no way of knowing otherwise, but it turned out to be a female. HR accused me of ‚Äúharassment and discrimination‚Äù and launched an ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù of me and took me off the schedule before the ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù even began. I recognized it for the set-up that it was and just resigned on the spot rather than waste my life trying to defend myself against a ridiculous charade in which I was guaranteed to lose.They didn‚Äôt miss a beat. They immediately replaced me with someone zero expertise, almost no experience, and inferior zero credentials who was willing to work for the low pay and toe the party line. (They‚Äôre just using him, too, though, and he will surely get axed when they want to fill the spot with one of their political buddies).I have officially stopped giving a fuck about what anybody thinks and stopped trying to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with mainstream society, which is now controlled by these Bolsheviks.I do, however, greatly fear that the government will send in armed goons in a MRAP to kill me if I make one misstep someday.Just like the Soviet Union.

                Universities are an obsolete institution that made sense in the 14th century but with the changes in technology are a net, and nearly complete, waste of resources today.We need our very own Henry the VIII to do to them what he did to monasteries, that had similarly outlived their usefulness to society.

                    Homeschooling is probably not an alternative for tertiary education. K-12 great.  University, not so much.Online is much better alternative, albeit not sufficient for all training.  And online needs to be careful managed to be effective.  Online is much, much more than a camera set up in front of a lecturer.STEM education which often requires labs and hands on stuff would seem problematic as well.  Not sure how a human anatomy class would be taught at home over a Zoom connection.   üòâRather than burn down the system, fundamental reforms can/need be made.  For example, Europe issues Bachelors degrees in three years‚Äînot four.  Why, they don‚Äôt milk students for tuition, nor offer remedial courses in HS basics, like Math and English, nor much in the way of electives.  And of course, students are tracked after grade school into academic vs non-academic career paths.  No country will waste resources in putting students of low intellect into University.

                        Thank you for the reply. I assume you are from Europe? Yes, most countries there seem to have a saner University system. I‚Äôm probably over-generalizing, but often the education is free, but you must qualify, and openings by specialization are limited so you might not get in even if you otherwise qualify. And, in general, your governments don‚Äôt waste money and effort on educating those of lower ability.However, I‚Äôve read that in some countries (Greece?) a college degree is basically worthless because the rich can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù a degree for themself. America has all this and more; we have everything from diploma mills, to programs that actually train and educate people. Of course what we comment upon here is the political and other rot that slowly is poisioning the academy, as Xman bemoaned.Similarly, our primary/secondary education system has become so watered-down in half a century that the results are all over the map. In some cases a High School diploma will be from a good school, but oftentimes it worth little more than for wiping one‚Äôs backside üòÄConsider:100, maybe 60 years ago, many States did not require school attendance past 8th grade. An American High School diploma was ‚Äì easily ‚Äì the equal of a 4-year degree in today‚Äôs Universities (for average students.) Yes, standards really have dropped that far. Today, of High School grads, roughly 15% of whites, 30% of Latinos, and 39% of Blacks are too stupid to enter the Armed forces, even the Marines!Come to think of it, the average Black IQ (about 85), equates to an 8-th grade education (‚Äúold style‚Äù I guess). That makes my Wikipedia comment all the more relevant (see my reply to Yves Vannes above). Perhaps in the old days, at least in Virginia, they did not routinely educate ‚ÄúNegroes‚Äù past 8th grade, except for the gifted, who got sent to Washington?If you‚Äôve received your education in Europe, thank your socialized stars üôÇ

                            Ben, I sometimes assume of the other commenters here that they are familiar (fed up?) with me.  As you are not, then I‚Äôll tell you.I am not a product of European education.  All American, but before the great poz‚Äôing of the University system.  My professors as a young undergrad wore suites and ties and even smoked in the classroom during lecture.I spent my entire career in higher education at the university.  I am a first generation American as well.  My father came here after the war from an occupied country.  America was all he thought about (that and food) while he was under occupation.  All my family on my father‚Äôs side remains in the old country, and if you knew my name, you could Google any number of them who are faculty in universities over there.  I was surprised at this myself, but it runs in the family I guess.However, what I state wrt university education is only my opinion based on my experience and often, is not as insightful as some of the other commenters in this group.  So treat it with a grain of salt at times.I have my biases‚Äîsuch as a hesitation to toss the institution out because of the crazies who have taken over.  At least not until I see my recommendations for remediation fail under test.  Most have never been tried here in the States, but can be shown to be useful elsewhere.

                Although it was in a different context, a few days back I posted what happened to Washington, D.C.‚Äôs Dunbar High School. It was ironically, a school for high-achieving Blacks that was ruined by Brown vs. Board of Education.I think a similar thing is happening to the universities, quality and politics-wise, albeit over a much longer time period. I found the Wiki particularly amusing because I assume Wikipedia is a Liberal snake pit, yet given such a bias, the article seems very objective.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar_High_School_(Washington,_D.C.)I was intrigued by the Fairfax Co. VA comments. Of course decades before my time, I grew up in that county, so it‚Äôs a bit of local history.  VA was pretty skinflint back in the Jim Crow days, and it was mighty white of them, so to speak, to pay for the higher education of the ‚ÄúNegro.‚Äù Students would‚Äôve had long commutes by train/trolley, even in closer towns.I didn‚Äôt check the list of illustrious alumni, but on a bet none of them attended after 1954. Good to know they have good athletics program! üôÇ

            ‚ÄúI do, however, greatly fear that the government will send in armed goons in a MRAP to kill me if I make one misstep someday.‚ÄùThey will, I‚Äôve already had the armored car full of goons at 3 am and I got it from a work dispute just like you. But unlike your tranny that just ran screaming like the shriveled sack mutant it was to HR against you, mine ran to the cops. Consider yourself lucky as if you get a criminal charge or your story goes public you will have areallyhard time getting employment again.That is where we are headed next now that the police can‚Äôt actually go after blacks anymore. I said it before they will do anything to hold that power as many of them are damaged people which is why they seek that profession. If whitey as the target is what it takes to get public acceptance again, they will go all in. Look no further than the Covid-19 crackdown on ‚ÄòSWPL‚Äô activities if you doubt this outcome.

                During my evening walk I was thinking precisely about the problem that ‚Äúpolice can‚Äôt actually go after blacks anymore.‚Äù What if that becomes the norm? Of course, Black crime will get much worse. But what will non-criminals (any race) do? Lacking recourse to the law, some of them will defend themselves by force, up to and including a gun. I wonder how many cases of white man shoots black man (with murder, civil rights, etc. charges if caught) it‚Äôll take to ratchet up the country towrads a hot civil war? Do you think we are heading this way or am I just being paranoid?

                    Of course they won‚Äôt go after POC, but reserve their efforts on the easy prey, Whites. That is to say, those folk who won‚Äôt give them grief. But even that will ease and a level of lawlessness become the new norm. Even before now, there was difficulty recruiting new police officers as to prior decades. The job was always dangerous and for the crap you took, not too great in renumeration, but it was prestigious. Grade schoolers wanted to be doctors, lawyers, cops, when they grew up. Now, not so much.Life will be a little more harsh and brutal, especially for those without resource to peaceful gated communities, and private security, and Whitopias.As the police departments become less White, their functionality will decrease. Detective work involves some smarts and dedication. White beat cops strove for that promotion and rise in rank and pay. How will this work when our ‚Äúnew‚Äù police force all resemble the ‚Äúrent a cops‚Äù we see standing by the door in our department stores checking packages?

            Agree, though I believe that the situation is complex. It‚Äôs partly about fear for many whites, but it‚Äôs also about morality for many whites, particularly women. That morality is what gets so many whites to vote for a party that openly hates them ‚Äì not that voting is going to matter.Social ostracism goes a long way, but as I mentioned in my comment, it only goes so far.

My biggest hope and fear in single statement. Hope that this will recede and the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù will temporarily mouth the safe platitudes while pulling the lever for ratcheting this back.

The fear that the votes will be undermined and the amoral Leftists/Globohomos will just manufacture victories. Of course, that fear rides tandem with relief‚Ä¶ relief that we no longer have any moral obligation to abide by the rules.

                It isn‚Äôt morality to simply ape the mob. Indeed, most woke whites subscribe uncritically to the cult of victimhood, which explicitly denies agency for practically everyone but heterosexual white males, the putative patriarchal oppressors. True morality requires an act of the individual‚Äôs will predicated on his or her having chosen that act with a fully informed conscience. This is why the NPC meme is so accurate and provocative as an accusation. It would be more nuanced to say that while some are acting from fear, others appear to be acting from something akin to religious ecstasy from participating in a purity spiral of virtue signaling.

        Over the years, we have retreated farther away from the trappings of major civilization. I have lived here for almost a decade and I can count the number of joggers I have seen on both hands. Even the section 8 housing here, populated by mostly down on their luck white people, are clean and well ordered. Crime is low and mainly of the druggie/burglary type. I do not miss the cities. I do not miss the great dark crowds of entitled miscreants bent on stealing my shit because they are too damned lazy or unmotivated. I worked hard for decades and, in every job, produced value far in excess of what I took from the economy. It has been a good run. I just want to be left alone for my elder years.I read a quote many years ago; it seems appropriate.  There is a storm a-coming; and, it is starting to rain.

        Even a mad king had financial incentives not to go overboard.   Nowadays nearly all of the pushers of the insanity are nearly immune to any practical financial considerations.  They are either in the government, academia, massive foundations, in the outright monopolies in the tech sector, or in the media oligopolies.Imagine giving the nastiest AWFL in your neighborhood a couple million to work on community advancement and watch the swath of destruction she will cause.  That‚Äôs our nation right now.

            Fortunately the damage such person(s) will do tends to be limited by the sheer greed and incompetence of such movements. After skimming off as much as you can for yourself, and for your closest friends, whatever remains will ‚Äî sort of ‚Äî be put to use in whatever the organization‚Äôs stated purpose was. Particularly in these ‚Äúwoke‚Äù times, such a mission is likely to be very ill-defined. For example, in practice, what does it really mean to (I‚Äôm making these up) ‚Äúempower disadvantaged urban youth and give them opportunities to participate in society‚Äù or to ‚Äúincrease access to affordable health services by the at-risk‚Äù? If that is your mission statement, then anything from a vocational jobs training program, to midnight basketball, to printing up anti-drug-abuse or healthy-diet pamphlets, and so on. Many of these are doomed to fail simply by knowing a bit about human nature: people are stubborn. They aren‚Äôt easily swayed to give up things they like, be it unwholesome foods, sex acts, recreational drugs, alcohol, tobacco and so forth. No is the welfare mother with five offspring to care for, or the multiple convicted felon with a sub-80 IQ likely to even attend any offered jobs training, nor is it likely than any employer will offer such a cretin a job even if he/she does ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù said ‚Äútraining.‚ÄùNone of this is to say that no good ever comes from such publicly funded efforts. But any actual progress comes at a huge overhead cost, and most of the money merely feathers the nests of those who handle the funds, or their cronies.Looked at another way: Have you ever worked, even on the edges, of any government agency or program? Then you‚Äôve seen first hand the inefficiences, the waste, the failed objectives, excuses, the limited ability to change course or even discipline the incompetent, and all the other folly of such programs. This will be many times worse when people of color are in charge. An excellent example of noble objectives, billions spent, and failure is this:https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/money-school-performance-lessons-kansas-city-desegregation-experiment

        The madness is not confined to the USA. It has been exported to my imperial province where BLM is now the most potent political and social force in Britain.Already, our institutions are ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù every historical symbol and landmark in advance to ensure compliance. The ‚Äúconservative‚Äù government of Boris Johnson did everything short of physically grovel to the mob and pledged to ‚Äúdo much more to combat racism‚Äù.  What they mean, of course, is that our history and culture is going to be dismantled and put in the shredder.We have only had a minute taste of what is to come; a waft of scent emanating from the Africanised future that is being cooked up for us with assiduous care in the kitchens of the academy, the boardroom, the courtrooms, the newsrooms and administrative halls.That said, I refuse to allow despair into my life. Despite the undeniable truth that a lot of red pills have dropped in this last two weeks, it is not enough yet. Most British normies are still wandering around in a state of bewilderment, clinging to the hope that things will settle down, sanity will be restored and chanting the mantra of ‚Äúhypocrisy‚Äù in the impotent hope that it if they keep repeating it, they will banish the evil spirits.The tipping point is here.

            People such as us are going to have incredible repositories of history, that the people of tomorrow will not even believe had ever happened.  The powers-that-be will strip the past down to some grey, oppressive maismatic thing, and we will have stories of valor, of sacrifice, of beautiful construction and creation, and it will be our secret history.

        Morality, collective morality, is imposed by sanction either socially or from on high.  It requires access to power and the levers of power.  The intense jockeying going on right now between the factions of the left is the ultimate effort to harness Democrat party machinery and grab a hold of the power ring that is FedGov.  At that point, corporate power and Fed power will be in lockstep.  The republicans will do nothing to stop the advance.Hope lies in the sheer incompetence of these people.  At some point, people stop listening.  After all, the Soviets were the big bad boogeymen until over the course of a week, they suddenly weren‚Äôt and the whole thing folded up shop‚Ä¶

            There is another hope:  and this is that what we might be seeing , are the death throes of a dying system.I posted this yesterday , but it‚Äôs worth posting again because it‚Äôs relevant to your post.Martin Armstrong is of the opinion that what is happening is that socialism is dying. It is (like Thatcher said) ‚Äì running out of other people‚Äôs money.In that context ‚Äì the screams of ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter!!‚Äù ‚Äì have more of pleading quality to them.  Especially if  you take into account some of the info I‚Äôve seen on how much the typical black costs society just to keep alive. Blacks are a net drain.  Once enough people fully come to realize that ‚Äì and the government tries to increase their tax raping ‚Äì a lot of people are going to start asking serious questions about the welfare state ‚Äì and most specifically ‚Äì WHO is on the dole.Armstrong:https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/armstrongeconomics101/economics/is-socialism-dying/It is dying because the social programs can no longer be funded from pensions to the size of government employment. Because this is dying, it also results in aggressive fighting back in the system to try to save it. In part, this has been the intense hatred of Trump, and the Democrats feel they must take the White House to save their agenda. Consequently, the rise in activity is the direct result of it declining. If nothing was at risk, there would be no need for this intense rise in resistance. So they are reactingONLYbecause it is failing. We see this in Europe where they are moving to cancel all currency to force people back to the banks where they will be charged negative interest rates for daring to save.Unfortunately, we have the last twelve years left. Marxism never works. They have tried it so many times. It fails because they try desperately to change human nature. They constantly portray someone having more than they do as evil and unjust. We are all created equal in rights, but not in talents. Some people faint at the sight of blood and others can be doctors. Some are great athletes and others can‚Äôt run 20 yards. We should see the end of Marxism with the collapse of governments beginning in 2032 moving into 2037/2038.

                One could make the argument that we are in the midst of the dying of the final boss of the Progressive project.  I wish it were so.One important element of what is going on is that there is no concrete end game for them; there are no tangible goals.  This is simply a nihilistic exercise in destruction and elimination of everything in sight.  As such, there is no rational response to such an irrational ask, other than to deny it and resist it in total and everyday.

                    But there is a goal. If someone, or say a well organized gang, gained by fraud, would it make sense for them, to get rid of the people who know about that larceny, who could possible call them to account ?I think there is a movie there ‚Äì I‚Äôd call it ‚ÄúThe Dark Syndicate‚Äú.

        I think you guys forget that this movement (or whatever you want to call it) is MASSIVELY popular. Most white people under 50 that I know are openly talking about white privilege and ending white supremacy. They support taking down racist iconography.I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. People I know are already talking about abolishing private schools and banning firearms. Most people want hate speech laws and feel that the media needs more gatekeeping power.I don‚Äôt have any opinion on the matter but from an outsiders perspective it seems to me that white conservatives are in for a rude awakening.

            Probably depends on who your circle of friends are.  Things like banning school alternatives usually seem quite the imperative to the childless, or die hard ideologue.  But to those with children, they suddenly seem to prefer the best education to the alternative‚Äîsacrifice of their progeny on the alter of pathological egalitarianism.  Not sure the riots over school busing in Boston were by conservative Rep‚Äôs.Firearms are similar in that you have no need for them until you have a need for them.  Then you line up with everyone else to buy out the local gun shop.  Here, for example, the ad‚Äôs on the radio literally state when shipments arrive and what time you may come by to buy such.  As was the case with toilet paper, they are sold out within hours.  I live in a Leftist/Liberal county/city, but I am pretty certain not all those in line are Whites.But I concede, anything is possible with the level of stupidity and ignorance of the average voter.  Heck, even talking about voting implies that folks‚Äîright or left‚Äîreally have say in such matters, and we know that‚Äôs a fairly tenuous assumption.

        One thing that liberal democracy does to help fanatics explore their fanaticism is to attempt to destroy, at every turn, the role of fatherhood in the lives of children.  The Supreme Court decision this week was yet another blow against fatherhood, where genders float freely in this new exploratory environment.  As a matter of fact the entire setup from day one, the design of the welfare state and tax system is a virtual factory for an unruly, emotive, bastard population.  A population that loots an Old Navy 20 years later, which is sad on more than one level.  As a matter of fact, a Christian, transported a couple hundred years to the present would call this whole society‚Ä¶.satanic.

        It‚Äôs more than just morality and social ostracism. There‚Äôs an iron fist inside that velvet morality glove. Not being invited to parties is one thing, losing your job and being blackballed forever is quite another.But I would agree that these whites (not the Jews, however) wield that power with a true sense of righteousness. The Karens believe. I‚Äôd also agree that Progressivism by its nature can‚Äôt stop. To be a Progressive, you have to be out in front of the general population in your beliefs. Once society as a whole comes around to your beliefs (either by persuasion or force), you lose your moral righteousness which forces you to move out in front of society no mater where it leads.That‚Äôs why the CivNat collapse on race is disturbing. Average whites have adopted the views of the Progressives which will force the Progressives to move farther out ideologically. If Joe Normie now says that white privilege is real and white racism is the cause of black problems, Progressives must start to espousing positions that Joe Normie finds too a bridge too far, such as reparations, kneeling to blacks, whites signing certifications admitting their racist sins, defunding police, allowing black crime, etc.

                I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs a bit of both, the media hyping whites who grovel, but I think that a lot of us have seen in our own lives and in our areas a certain capitulation of CivNat types who went from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see color‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all just Americans‚Äù to ‚Äúracism and systemic injustice are real and we whites need to listen to the black community.‚ÄùRegardless, it doesn‚Äôt matter to Progressives. Just like with gay marriage, the new accepted view of society with no real push-back anymore is white racism exists and is the main cause of black problems. Whether Joe Normie fully believes that or not, it‚Äôs what he says in public. But Progressives never want to be in the same ideological spot as Joe Normie. They are Progressives after all.The Progressives will now need to move to a new position on race. Now that whites have admitted their guilt, Progressives will demand more action, more groveling by whites. Progressives will push that to the point the whites start to disagree, which will make Progressives once again out in front of whites (at least in their mind) ideologically and thus more moral again.As to your point, no, we don‚Äôt need to whites who willingly grovel. However, we can recruit those whites who are beginning to realize that there will never be a truce in this war, that they will never be left alone. We need to recruit the whites who are waking up to the fact that they won‚Äôt be able to just hide and live their lives. The Progressive whites and their brown horde will come for them and demand money and fealty.

                    The CivNats are going with the program, but I have noticed how many of them have smartly learned to simply shut up and say or do nothing.  The Proggies hate that, and the next step will be to make the ask for positive affirmation of their cause.  CivNats will do it by rote, with their fingers crossed behind their backs.  Then will be the ask for sufficient enthusiasm, like the videos of the NK big shots clapping wildly so they don‚Äôt get taken out and shot.  Incremental asks will never end, but they are asks for a set of ideas that have no concrete goals, but are instead simply a variation of Lennon‚Äôs ‚ÄúImagine‚Äù.  At some point, the laughing and giggling start among the CivNats, and it all quickly unravels.  But there is likely a lot of ruin between now and when that comes to pass.

                I assume that the CivNats being quiet and not responding is going along with noticing.  But there is a big bridge, occupied by the troll of upside-downside personal trade offs of career and social standing, that may block the way from those CivNats truly coming over to our side for some time yet.  Just my take on the thing, YMMV.

                Correct. Trump &amp; Co. IS the Common Sense Cavalry, and they‚Äôve been pinned down and outflanked by the deep state. I dunno about you, but this lunacy is not invoking any fearful or honourable or virtuous feelings in me. All I got now is a quiet, cold fury and a murderous rage against the people responsible.A blitzkrieg is coming. Necks will be stretched, people will be purged and genocides will be in the offing.

                        Exactly Meme. This may pass like other crazes that have swept society before.. or it may not (at least in the blue hives). But if you are in a smaller burg or town, keep lists. If this subsides or turns into societal breakdown, punish those that participated in this. Ruin, besmirch, undermine, tar, and hinder them in all ways possible. If this eventually passes they should be encouraged to excise themselves from Our communities. If it does not, they will only become a fifth column weeping sore amongst you. They are wicked and deserve no rest or joy outside of complete repentance and humbling themselves publicly.

                        I am merely stating the obvious. Things can‚Äôt keep going like this. Something is going to give. When it does‚Ä¶ most of the people who are good at fighting will be on our side. Leftie is burning his own cities down. For him to continue, he is going to need massive infusions of other people‚Äôs money. The next civil war is not going to look like the last one.

            Don‚Äôt legitimize a system that is out to destroy you. Get involved in local groups and politics if feasible. If you‚Äôre in a vibrant area do whatever you need to do to get out. If you have to take a pay cut and give up some economic security consider it self-preservation. Things are going to get even worse. If you don‚Äôt get out now will you even have a choice to do so in the future? A nice home and a good job in a place run by enemies and animals who want you at least gone if not dead. Just how long do you think you‚Äôll be able to hang on to those things?National politics is off the table for us. The only thing a Trump win can possibly do for us is drive our enemies to outright warfare. Even if he wins because so many are desperate and they manage to elect him‚Ä¶they will pull the plug as they did with so many local elections in 2018. Should he survive he will play your champion while he screws you from all angles. Think local act local.Let‚Äôs withdraw as much as we can from Clownworld. Give them a taste of a world without YT. It will force the issues of group identity and group interests that so many in our tribe are determined to avoid. We can‚Äôt destroy a system that wants to destroy us if we keep shouldering all its needs.

                Yes Yves. Yes. This. I‚Äôve already come to the conclusion Ours dont get to have cities, at least not in the foreseeable future. Even as we gather into communities, the unwelcome mat must be laid out for any noticable number of others that will inevitably be drawn to Our productivity and success. Castigation for those of Our tribe that start the stirrings of the same old social justice lies. Dont know if it is possible but it is the only way I think.

                If the last four months have taught anyone anything, it should be that the system is your enemy.There are a few holdouts still on our side, but they have no power.  Good cops etc‚Ä¶ would best serve Whites by turning in their shields &amp; joining our communities outside this system.  Servicemen too.Uniquely-positioned monkey-wrenchers aside, that is.  There‚Äôs a role for that but those will be outliers.Jews are not going to let White interests be discussed, much less advanced, in politics on a state or national level.We have to plan to first survive then fight.  Let TPTB have the favelas as we remove functional White cogs from their matrix and add them to our groups.Living White is better than living ‚Äúwell‚Äù in a society that wants to destroy you.

                    Be sure to avoid the outward appearance of living ‚Äúwell‚Äù in our communities.

                        I‚Äôm with you, Dutch.  I never liked suits as much as blue jeans and boots, which is why I don‚Äôt miss trial work as I get older.  You‚Äôd be amazed at the disdain I garner for driving an old Chevy pickup instead of some upscale sedan.  Wine and cheesers judge by appearance; but the only way to really know a man is by his deeds and not by his look.  Words may sound fine yet be entirely empty.  It‚Äôs why the rise of social media and the preoccupation with ‚Äúoptics‚Äù are ultimately dissatisfying.  Real community is like a good stew, just a few simple ingredients cooked together slowly.

                The lone wolf needs encouragement too. Remember Mr. Tarrant, the Aussie who killed quite a few in New Zealand a year or two back? I don‚Äôt condone his actions, but if you read his manifesto, he had a lot of crazy shit, but also some very practical advice along the lines of : ‚ÄúWork your way into the system, ina place where you may have future influence.‚Äù Especially based on his MO, I don‚Äôt think he had community organizing in mind üòÄ Joining any group entails risks, all the more so if/when certain activities become illegal or even suspect. Even now, our internet fingerprints are saved for years, and little if any privacy protections exist. Of course, the Feds can vacuum up anything they like. The truly paranoid know how to cover their tracks. ‚ÄúThe System‚Äù already knows who I am, so I have no incentive to hide. My point is that some individuals want to stay the lone wolf. What then can they do now, or when the balloon goes up?

                I‚Äôm not too worried about it Howard. Consider our opponents: they are so dumb that they burn their own cities, and have even knocked down their own civil war monuments.

                I just had a phone visit with my extended family. My 30-ish cousin told me of the wonderful Supreme court decision that upheld tranny and gay rights (I still don‚Äôt know the details, nor care.) I told her that I was surprised that I hadn‚Äôt heard about it on the right-wing sites I frequent üòÄ Now I have. I still don‚Äôt care about the details. I did (tiny) red-pill my Liberal cousin: I stated that everyone should have the same rights. We must plant the red pill where we can, and hope it may have some effect.On a slight tangent, as I was talking my evening stroll (still safe in my community), I was trying to recall what (in my opinion) is the proof that we have become a silly country: As a candidate, I nominate the SCOTUS decision a few years back that a Bakery had a right to refuse to provide a gay wedding cake, and that this was a religious freedom issue. I‚Äôm not saying the decision was right or wrong. I do claim the mere fact that such a decision ever entered into the legal system shows that we long ago became a silly nation. That one takes the cake! :D. We are doomed, I agree with you, Mr. Derbyshire! üôÇ

                    The wedding cake description is incorrect.  The baker would sell a cake already made, he had many on display, but would not decorate such specifically for a gay couples wedding.There is a difference.  One is selling a commodity to whomever comes through the door‚Äîand it was shown he had other, gay customers who for years entered his bakery and did business with him.  Never did he turn them away or treat them differently than any other non-gay customer.The other involves participation in‚Äîor celebration of‚Äîthe wedding.  To wit, he was requested to decorate the cake himself in special ways, ex. two groomsmen holding hands, and so forth.  This he could not do in good conscious.  He also I believe recommended an alternative bakery which he knew did such cakes.  But of course, that wasn‚Äôt why the gay couple were there.  They were looking for a court case in order to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù his livelihood and make an example to others who might not celebrate gayness to the appropriate extent.This is little different from photographers refusing to take pictures of such a wedding celebration.  I believe this has been upheld by some courts.l‚Äôve been to several weddings with professional photographers‚Äîincluding my own‚Äî and I can see how one might have a problem with two same sex people and poses that are traditional between man and wife and groomsmen and bridesmaids.  You‚Äôd need experience in the gay community.  Remember, if folks don‚Äôt like your pictures, you make little to no profit on the engagement.

        I think virtue is an individual trait, as in the pursuit of excellence and an ethical life. Honor is a code of virtues shared among peers while morality is a commonly held ethical framework for a society. Traditionally honor and morality held each other in check. Excesses of moral piety could be stopped by manly honor while excessive violence or rivalry resulting from honor could be stopped by a genuine respect for morality.Long ago western civilization decided to do away with honor because there are no peers ‚Äì we are ALL equal after all. The moment that a man could face prison for punching another man for insulting his honor, or challenge him to a duel, was the moment that civilized society started its death spiral with unchecked fanatical public morality.Men of honor would not allow a fraction of what is happening today, but everybody knows that men of honor will spend a significant part of their life behind bars.

It used to be if I insulted your honor, you were not a man unless the two of us went out and had a gunfight from which more than likely only one of us would coming back.  Once the state took over the role of enforcement, honor inevitably withered away when the means to enforce it was taken away.

                Exactly. And there is no redress for a breach of honor in the justice system because running to authorities to report someone for challenging your honor is a distinctly unhonorable thing to do even if it was enforced. It‚Äôs like the entire system is designed to squash manliness except among those that don‚Äôt care about a livelihood or imprisonment ‚Äì a perfect recipe for chaos.

        Polygamyis still sort of meh among the woke, as it is far to focused on a traditional one man-many women dynamic for the woke to really accept it.Polyamory, however, where degenerates live with and debase themselves with multiple ‚Äúpartners‚Äù is the new buzzword. It‚Äôs especially (un)holy when each partner has his own pronouns and proclivities.

            Can‚Äôt think of a single functioning society where polygamy is practiced. Even when culturally supported, the 30-50% of males who‚Äôll never mate get hosed.Maybe Utah with the Mormons as it comes back into the open. Worked for awhile when they got going (low male to female ratio), but it‚Äôs a loser strategy for the kind of society I‚Äôm down with.Polyamory is just weird.

        At the grassroots level, it seems to me like so much of this is being driven by White (and to a lesser extent, Asian) women. From Nextdoor to Facebook to Twitter all I see are White gals of all ages clawing all over each other to signal louder about how much they love BLM. What happened to these women? Where are their husbands? I wonder. Seems likely to me that this‚Äìall of this‚Äì is just the result of modern females‚Äô deep, profound unhappiness in the new role they‚Äôve been forced by their own actions to play. It‚Äôs the dog that caught the car. They can‚Äôt admit that they‚Äôd much prefer to go back to a life where men make the decisions outside of running the household‚Ä¶but they really, really do. When the female protesters showed up at the Kavenaugh hearings dressed in Handmaid‚Äôs Tale outfits, they weren‚Äôt just making a stupid and overwrought ‚Äústatement‚Äù; they were expressing subconsciously the deepest most forbidden desires of their hearts. Now, the biological scales are swinging wildly in correction. They want subjugation and they want it bad. So bad they‚Äôll destroy civil society to get it‚Äìeither at the hands of feral Black warlords (more likely) or from normal White men when we finally decide we‚Äôve had enough of this lunacy (less likely, unfortunately). One way or another, these gals will be dragged back into the kitchens, ‚Äúresisting‚Äù with heaving bosoms all the way.

            Ageed ‚Ä¶ I think that the argument can be made that White men, at various times, did not stand up to protect White women from the invading hordes and Black abusers.  This passivity, although necessary from a legal basis, sent a message to all White females that they were ‚Äúup for grabs‚Äù.  Females like to be ‚Äúwanted‚Äù and, consequently, gravitated to those who ‚Äúwanted‚Äù them.  Basically, this mixing should still be against the law, like many of the socially controlling laws of yesteryear, it was repealed in the name of Liberal Democracy.

        Re.‚ÄúLike a school of fish, morality shifts on a dime and that new direction is assumed to be the general will and therefore the proper course.‚ÄùThe insane sluts and their enablers, lead by the claque, are not interested in facts or ideas.They need Social Proof. They‚Äôre tuned in to the murmurations emanating from the flock, that signal the direction to be taken. The band wagon is proof enough ‚Äì jump on for the ride!The only way for the establishment to save their asses is to use the organs of indoctrination ‚Äì the schools and the media; to create a fake liberal democratic, multicultural consensus over ‚Äòidentity‚Äò and shared ‚Äòvalues‚Äô.The electronic media can present whatever they like as a popular consensus or the opinion of the masses, even if no one believes it. Presentation and the mere exposure effect, confer legitimacy by manufacturing reality.There was a time when ‚Äòtruth‚Äô was decided by counting heads ; fifty percent plus one equals verity. Counting is no longer required, when verisimilitude¬†wins the day.The cargo cult of television confers authority on media hacks who are presented as reliable arbiters of reality. Ultimate reality is divined by talking heads ‚Äì ‚Äòexperts‚Äô and ‚Äòscientists‚Äô, validated by the media and media personalities, granted the indisputable imprimatur of television.Certified reality is a cue for legions of half-wits to play their part. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to take friendly fire by crossing this manufactured consensus, best shut their gob.Legions of grandstanding schoolmarms , virtue signalling scolds and hateful harpies monitoring our speech and making sure that no one engages in pattern recognition. They are assisted by their poodles, the physiognomy boys ‚Äì the phys does not lie ‚Äì the numales, manginas and homomaniacs, all fall in line behind the insane sluts.Liberal democracy is a useful smokescreen for anonymous plutocrats. The liberal managerial class ruling the West, preserves its own legitimacy by using manipulation and patronage to construct a democratic facade, for its own exercise of power.Ideas are the product of the human mind . When people attribute social change or political movements to broad conceptual frameworks like Gay Rights, Systemic Discrimination or Hate Speech,¬†they deflect from the fact that behind those formations are people with money , power and influence, with an agenda, who are promoting those ideas .Abstract forces do not promote social change, they don‚Äôt pass laws or make television commercials or seek to influence the direction of society.The most important question is, who are these people? They have names and addresses. They must be called to account, held to their own standard of collective guilt and punished unto the third and forth generation.

            Remember what‚Äôs actually going on here, boys, this is an alien contact story. Subspecies of the human race that have not had large-scale contact with each other for up to 125,000 years are suddenly being brought together unmediated for the first time, of course there‚Äôs chaos. Social institutions designed for altruistic co-operators are suddenly being exploited by people whose instincts and institutions fitted them for survival on the most dangerous continent on Earth, countries with societies designed for rice-growing peasants now have supersonic jets and nuclear weapons, people whose inherited social attitudes developed as a despised religious minority now hold unprecedented wealth and power among their erstwhile oppressors, it‚Äôs honestly a wonder things aren‚Äôt even worse.ÔªøAs in those old sci-fi stories, some go insane, some worship the aliens, and some resolve to fight back and preserve themselves. But this mess was literally tens of thousands of years in the making, it‚Äôs utterlyfrivolous to believe that just voting for some guy, or tweaking a few laws, is going  to solve things. There is almost certainly a way out of this, but we have to survive first. make your preparations accordingly.

        Z Man said: ‚ÄúNo one in power is offering an alternative, other than more fear of the mob. The only questions now are the timing and terror of the eventual collapse.‚ÄùThe madness can‚Äôt go on forever. Sooner rather than later an authoritarian regime will have to take over and clamp a lid on the chaos. I don‚Äôt see anyone on the horizon with the charisma and gravitas to pull it off, but the people that own and operate this hell hole won‚Äôt let eveything completely collapse just to placate the church of woke. If I‚Äôm wrong, then the mass uncontroled immigration will be going in the other direction .

        Good essay. One takeaway is: no one type of political system endures for long. Monarchy becomes tyranny, leading to revolution. Perhaps a different despot replaces the old. Sometimes a republic is born. History provides interest exceptions. Spain is odd. Most recently, a mellowing dictator (Franco) peacefully handed rule over to a democracy. Spain has a long history of liberal-consersative-democracy-dictator; its ex-colonies have remarkably similar stories. Maybe they‚Äôre not typical. But one style of rule never lasts more than a few centuries. This is even to be expected; change is constant and unavoidable. Many things are cyclical. With governments and societies, probably the major cycles are decades and centurys in duration.What does our future hold? Of course, no one can know for certain. When I look at recent (past century) history, I see many parts of the globe that were to some degree a democracy. Many parts of Africa, the Mideast, were relatively liberal. Often these were current or recent colonies of European powers, or at least influenced by them. Once the foreign power withdrew, usually (always, perhaps?) things deteriorated. I wryly note that most of America‚Äôs cities have decomposed similarly in the half-century or so since the white ‚Äúcolonial‚Äù power turned things over to the Melanic Hominid‚Ñ¢ popuation of those once-mighty cities. Almost certainly, there is a racial-social element in these changes of power and the results thereof.Age-old tribal and religious divisions reappeared and an apparently-unified country broke up into smaller fiefdoms. Sometimes this seems to settle out relatively peaceably, think of cold-war era Yugoslavia or USSR, apparently successfully divided into a few dozen countries. I note with pride that these populations are mostly Caucasian/Asiatic. Ah, but what happened in the Middle East? Beirut, once the ‚ÄúParis of the Mid-East‚Äù is now a patchwork of neighborhoods, usually by religious and political affiliation, ruled by local warlords and militias. Much of Africa, Black and non-Negro, are much the same. Is this what Europe and North America are fated to devolve into?Imagine an America where not only are no Blacks or Browns allowed into your neighborhood, but if any dare, they will be shot on sight. That may sound like heaven to the mostly-imaginary White Supremacist, but consider the rest of the story: there is no State or Federal government anymore, at least not one that can restrain the local militia‚Äôs actions. No more civil rights. And you, Whitey, will fare no better when you need to leave your zone. Like many, I think that ‚Äúhomelands‚Äù are a good idea. But in practice they‚Äôre not going to be two hge nations, instead they‚Äôll be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of tiny enclaves and no-man‚Äôs-lands between them.Contemplate how this will cripple the movement of goods and delivery of services. Yes, some supplies will move, but rather than inspection and taxes by government authorities, it‚Äôll be bribes paid to each checkpoint that may let you pass, or they may just keep your cargo and if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll be able to walk away. Inconceivable? Even today in much of the Third World, things are little better. Even being able to get a letter reliably delivered as we are accustomed to in Europe, the USA and perhaps most of Asia is an historical anomaly. Want an item of even moderate value delivered to some countries? Possible but expensive; the recipient will probably have to meet you at the airport for any realistic hope of the intended recipient actualy obtaining the item, and impossible unless a bribe is paid to the right people. I have an aquantance, a former flight attendant. He said that on passenger flights to various African nations, they‚Äôd routinely have to bring a briefcase of cash, in order to pay the various expenses.One thing is certain: We are truly letting the incompetent lead us. Partly this is because anyone with clearly defined values or goals is often correctly viewed as a threat by a large portion of the electorate. So the blandest, wishy-washy, pie-in-the-sky promises sound most appealing to the voters. Consider 2016. Trump, a buffoon with zero political experience, steamrolled the field of professional Republicans and narrowly won the Presidency. Not because he was good, but because he was the best of a bad bunch, the ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù candidate. Hate me if you are a Trumper. I‚Äôll probably vote for him in the fall, if elections are allowed. But only because he‚Äôs the lesser of two evils.Things have only gotten worse since then. Bad as he is, neither side has put up a more credible candidate than Trump for 2020. The other side is offering us an incipient dementia case, albeit one with extensive experience in politics. The Veep is still undecided but probably will be a shocker. There is a good chance that this appalling team will be ru[i]ning the country starting in just 7 months.History tells us that it will take a major, serious crisis. Then the ‚Äúman of the white horse‚Äù will appear. And then we will have our despot. üôÅ

                He won because he was rude and crude.  Not the pol we were used to and that differed him from all others.  He gleaned the ‚Äúprotest‚Äù vote of people who were tired of the same old shit.  Seems to me he has a chance if that image remains through the next election.  Certainly, the chaos expanding plays into that‚Äîas long as he is not considered the cause.

            The thing that jumps out to me about America is how different we all are, and yet cohesive. The colonies were very different, yet they stuck together and overcame an empire. The young republic tore itself apart in civil war and yet the nation survived and grew.This time it‚Äôs different, because the people are different, but we‚Äôve overcome long odds before. It‚Äôs what we do, and having the big break up and reformation seems to be how we settle these things as Americans.The script does call for a future Napoleon, but that‚Äôs all it is‚Äî a script. We‚Äôre going to play it in a way that suits us. For instance, the 20th century was the communist century, and while it sounds crazy that America had communism, I‚Äôd argue that‚Äôs what this liberal democracy business is. The American flavor of the stuff. Everything big, centralized, efficient, radically egalitarian, yet it had to at least make a show of individualism and self government, etc.  We‚Äôve adapted it to suit the national character, but the spirit of the thing is communist, and it‚Äôs ending. Not being an authoritarian society, the process is messy, noisy, tragic, violent‚Äî American.

            You say that the country will split into many parts. You see it already in incipient form. Sanctuary cities and states dont honor federal law, after Virginia gun laws some counties don‚Äôt honor state law, and in Seattle  a private group chased away police and patrol their own territory with guns.This is only a beginning.Civil war didn‚Äôt start in Fort Sumter in 1861 . It started in Kansas in 1856. 200 people died over there over the issue of slavery.

                I‚Äôve posited this before, but if we had a ‚ÄúCivil War II‚Äù, and using the new casualty estimate for the First üôÅ Civil War, and scaling to today‚Äôs population, we are looking at 6 million dead. If it occurs, broadly speaking, the issues will be much the same: Federal vs. State (or individual) control, freedoms infringed. Also the treatment of Blacks figure heavily. Hmmm‚Ä¶

            Ben, a bit of clarification wrt Spain and Franco is in order.  Franco named Juan Carlos (King of Spain) as his designated successor.  In turn Carlos headed a Parliamentary Republic.  One reading your post might assume Franco created something akin to a democracy as we understand it in the US.  I‚Äôm pretty sure Franco distrusted Democracy and did his best to avoid such excesses, however he knew he could not live forever.As Z-man pointed out, it is most likely we who are an aberration wrt our form of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, which I might add was *not* the original intention of the Founders‚Äîwe sank ourselves over a period of two centuries, and created this beast we now decry.

                Compsci, you are of course accurate. I‚Äôve even been outside his palace but that doesn‚Äôt make me an expert. But, so far as I know, all modern (past century or so) European countries with a monarch have been actually controlled by a parliament or similar. Usually the monarch has little, if any power in the government. Even having been a student of Spanish lit, I confess I don‚Äôt know the details of the current Spanish government. The more important point in my earlier post is that Spain dramatically swings its political pendulum between Franco-like Church and conservatism and liberalism and that‚Äôs going back a couple centuries, to 19th at least.

                    Well, there you got me.  I don‚Äôt pretend to know the powers granted to the King.  But what I‚Äôve heard is that the King was well liked by the people (similar to the Queen today in GB) and as such was a strong figurehead to lead the people into a semblance of democratic rule.This was important.  What Franco rebelled against  30 years previously (and what he is hated for by the left) was overthrowing the Constitutionally elected government of Spain that was turning communist.  He robbed the Leftist commies of a foothold in Western Europe.  Quite similar to Pinochet and Chile in the 70‚Äôs.Franco was no fool.  He ruled Spain until capitalism got a foothold and then left a strong central figure to maintain the momentum after him.

            History shows that monarchy is by far superior to all other forms of government. Somebody has to be in charge and hold the ultimate responsibility. Only monarch can do that. Not a clown monarch, like the ones that exist in the West today, but one with real power.

        Fear is what has allowed the morality to get so out of control.  A lot of this ‚Äúmorality signalling‚Äù is just fear masquerading as morality and the failure to stand up to it is entirely down to fear.

        Okay I take back my comment yesterday about your take being reductionist.If you have children, btw, and you dont want them being radicalized into fanatics by the system, relentlessly teaching them how this system works, and undermining its morality for them is the only vaccine against it afaik.I have been pounding into my kids‚Äô head how morality is being used as a bludgeon to make us weak. Usually through stories cos theyll actually listen to stories and it doesnt feel like they are being lectured.Now being one of the ‚Äúsmall minded‚Äù who thinks this is being used for our ruling class to solidify their power, i dont totally agree with your theory. Maybe it is a matter of degrees as far as how much agency the ruling class has in all of this. The real test then is whether or not the US finally stabilizes politically into a left wing regime and the revolution comes to a halt or it just continues to decline because there is no real ambitious ruling class and theres no breaks on the train.

        Two points1) Beyond the timing and terror of the collapse, there are a set of interrelated questions. First, do we stand clear or do we help topple it over ourselves? If the latter, how to push the Old Republic over so that it crashes down on our enemies? Second, what do we do when Zero Hour arrives, and how do we do it?2) We are already seeing a lot of new people popping up here and all over the dissident sphere. These numbers are only going to increase as the cultural revolution plays out. How to interact with them? I mean, how to treat them in a way that is absolutely clear about what they are getting into, prevents entryism to the greatest extend possible, and avoids the sort of often self-defeating a$$hole behavior common to other popular dissident sites?

        ‚ÄúLiberty, consent of the governed and equality before the law were purely theoretical concepts at the time, so he and other theorists had no working knowledge of them.‚Äù -ZmanI find those concepts pretty theoretical right now. I can‚Äôt think of a time in our history when equality before the law was really true and not a platitude. It always depended on money and connections.Liberty as I view it existed only in the early days when the State did not have the power to dictate what you could do and not do. The state‚Äôs power to control you grew over time like a cancer making liberty a joke.Consent of the governed has always been theoretical. Consider the fact that Tennessee has never been able to leave the union if Tennesseans wanted to do so. That simplistic example shows the problem. There has never been consent by all.Democracy, liberal or not, is the worst form of government in my view.

            Isn‚Äôt this where someone famous said ‚ÄúYes, but it is least worst of all the alernatives.‚Äù üôÇ But what in your opinion would be a better form?

The USA probably was better in the past, but still holds up pretty well compared to many, maybe most, justice systems in all times and places. It‚Äôs my understanding that, at least sometimes, even something most of us would consider alien, like Islamic law, can be impersonal ( = fair) although very harsh by Western standards. As I understand it, for example, if you murdered me, you could pay a ‚Äúfine‚Äù to my family as compensation, but it‚Äôs at my family‚Äôs discretion ‚Äî they could literally have your head if they choose. Sure, such a law favors the rich but it still lets the victim‚Äôs kin decide the penalty. It does have its good points, one must admit. Of course, just like our legal system, I suspect that Islamic law rapidly goes into left field when actually put into practice.

        I kind of wonder if this isn‚Äôt that last or next to last big gasp by the powers that be to get rid of Trump once and for all?  The Russian collusion hoax dragged on for most of his term but didn‚Äôt really resonate with most people despite the worthless media flogging 24/7.  Then the impeachment bs didn‚Äôt catch on, again despite media shilling.  However, the dreaded virus has finally created a huge lockstep where a large % of the population and corporate America, thru fear or design   has bought in lock, stock and barrel.  Now, that same large % has ‚Äúfish schooled‚Äù over to the racial injustice crap and the wiping away of White American history  without missing a beat.  Now that so many are on board voluntarily or involuntarily  with this institutionalized insanity, there just needs to be one more big anti Trump Hail Mary that the masses can herd to.  The question is, what‚Äôll it be?

        To analyze political structures, like liberal democracy or republicanism, without reference to the races of the rulers and the ruled, is to ignore the most consequential forces.Montesquieu wrote about political philosophy in homogeneous white societies.¬†That‚Äôs not what we have now.Of course, we are descending in to a madhouse.¬†But liberal democracy in the USA is just a symptom, not a cause.

            Line, how do you reason this?  Liberal democracy as we‚Äôve developed it, has given universal suffrage to all (the worthy and the unworthy).  For example, I would maintain that if we had none of our vibrancy voting, the pol‚Äôs would in turn not be catering to such and much of what passes for normal in this society would not be happening.  Sounds more like cause than symptom.

                It‚Äôs a symptom, because the real cause isn‚Äôt the democracy ‚Äî you say yourself that things would be different if we had none of our vibrancy voting. But it is our nature ‚Äî biology, culture, whatever ‚Äî to allow our vibrancy to vote. South Africa, Sweden, Rhodesia ‚Äî it‚Äôs a seemingly irresistable urge for us to offer the vibrants a seat at the table, and eventually a knife at our throats, and it rears its head no matter what political system under which we are operating.We only manage nice civilizations for as long as we keep the vibrancy out in the first place, and we have a darned hard time mustering the will to do that. The Nordic countries and Iceland are only getting eaten by vibrancy slowly, because a lot of the vibrants don‚Äôt really like living that far north.We weren‚Äôt always that way, I don‚Äôt think, but that‚Äôs the way we are now. How much is nature and how much nurture, I can‚Äôt say.Whether it‚Äôs liberal democracy, republicanism, monarchy, oligarchy, socialism or communism, the concepts of egalitarianism and universalism seem to spread in the West. Even the most inequal Western societies pay lip service to the concepts.

                Compsci, I can‚Äôt speak for Line, but your response sounds much like my husband when we‚Äôre debating possible futures.  He posits that if/when all vibrancy and small hats are removed, so too will the vast majority of problems and conflicts, and then the system can function as designed with a few tweaks here and there.  I disagree, because whether small hats or churchians building their New Jerusalem, that messianic fervor always springs up again somewhere.   Even all White societies have their bottom 10%, their easily led, and their women.  The vibrancy and the excess are symptoms, and the small hats may be pumping poison, but it‚Äôs the basic system that makes it all possible.  The concepts of democracy, egalitarianism, and the universal franchise need to be ditched, along with the ‚Äòinnate‚Äô goodness of the common man and wisdom of the ‚Äòexperts.‚Äô

                    Still don‚Äôt follow you and Viz, nor are you following me.  My argument has always been that suffrage is a privilege to be earned and not a birthright.  Universal suffrage was not envisioned by the Founders.  They set government up basically that way.  In addition, they included a concept of a federation of countries (States) to further weaken a future totalitarian Federal government.  Their writings indicated a great fear of democracy as rule by mob‚Äîyou know, like is the case today.Things seemed to work until unscrupulous politicians expanded the right in order to gain political power.  And here we are.  Whether we can go back to halcyon days was never mentioned in my posting, it‚Äôs you interpretation.However, since you mention it, then maybe you‚Äôd best figure out how you want to organize your new ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù in which your new society will live and hopefully thrive.Have yet to hear how you will handle decision making across the populous you intent to organize.  Because if you give everyone the right to vote‚Äîeven excluding say, women‚Äîyou‚Äôll be right back where you started from within a century, or 4 generations, which is the time after which no one in living memory will be around to tell the tale of what got us there in the first place.

        In a godless liberal democracy, Morality is a loose canon rolling around the deck damaging, crushing, and killing every time a wave goes by.Under Christianity, there was broad agreement on the basics.  It would produce a discussion and admission that Taxation is robbery, but perhaps necessary to prevent greater evils, but the conversation would be had.Now the problem is ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù, but the attempts at clarifying or focusing that to some actionable item is futile.

Just last night‚Ä¶Me; Trump is a spent force.Norm; What do you mean?Me; He‚Äôs the Mayor of Washington, his writ goes no farther than where the Federal Police stand.Trump failed to build Con$en$us.His Peace for instance cost the Generals their prosperity$ so he has no Army now.‚ÄùNormie; (despairing tone) ‚ÄúYou mean our vote is meaningless!?!‚ÄùI felt like an adult explaining to a child not to talk to other adults online.I think maybe we leave Normie out of this, its just too creepy explaining the Birds and the Bees to adults.  It‚Äôs not as if they can do us or anyone any good at all.  They can vote.  Let them vote. Its a harmless enough pastime.  Sorry, I‚Äôm just not needlessly cruel enough to do this‚Ä¶and its a profitless cruelty, like proving to a child that Santa Claus isn‚Äôt real.

The 500 miles of old wall were repaired and are now a reasonable barrier.

        Honestly, are we to believe that a bunch of ghetto-rat losers had the wherewithal to create this level of organized mayhem during these riots ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think so!  They obviously had help from the organized jewish sympathizer whites (or maybe they were jews) who made bricks and bottles of gasoline magically appear.My point?  The blacks, as prone to violence as they are, did not act alone!  AND, we need to point to the REAL problem.I honestly believe that blacks can be kept at bay at a reasonably small cost ‚Ä¶ yes, it cost money to feed people.  But the root of the problem is the jewish ‚Äúelites‚Äù that roust the blacks from the slumbers and get them in the ‚Äústealing mood‚Äù.OK, now what do we do?  We focus on the root problem, do our homework, and tell people that jews like George Soros just donated $18 BILLION to the Open Society Foundation to help destroy your country.  Its gonna be a tough slog but it has to start with awareness of the problem.

        a confessional state was always more solid, even if rotating between the three Aristotelian-Thomist forms of government. maybe that would control the madman ‚Äì exorcize it, or burn it on the stake if absolutely necessary.btw this rotation seems inevitable during certain periods to be honest. if anything, this period of modern-Masonic democracy lasted too long; feeding on the bourgeois wealth that rose up during monarchical Christian Europe, as well as on the remainders of colonial wealth, and on the best genes that came during that period (the lazies and steriles used to simply chose the priesthood, sweet deal right?).but then came secularism, which gave us modernism, which gave us commercialism, which gave us feminism, which gave us free (international/interracial) love, which gave us the madness of the two-headed beast we have today: globalist elitists using brown socialist hordes and cheap serf-credit for endless sterilizing consumption as weapons. adoptions of the tenets of this beast killed the reason to keep the aforementioned best genes among the high-iq, btw; while the low iq breed less, but still enough to keep going and remain low-iq anyway. ergo only the (((chosen ones))) and Masonic friends running the show will save themselves, while the gentiles burn and the low-iq pagan hordes fight out the mad max world‚Ä¶

                One should be skeptical of surveys. What people say they believe and what they really believe are often dramatically different. It‚Äôs obvious that social pressure and similar will influence a person‚Äôs words, but probably not so much their beliefs. In economics this is called a ‚Äúrevealed preference‚Äù and is sought after information by marketers, etc.This is not merely an academic curiosity. Remember ‚ÄúNew Coke‚Äù (1985 or so)? Coke did surveys and respondents said they preferred the taste of Pepsi. So Coke altered their ancient formula, unaware that people actually preferred Coke (shown by buying preference) yet reported differently in a survey. This was a major, expensive mistake for Coca-Cola.An excellent humorous (I hope!) joke to illustrate this is the classic marriage trap when the wife asks ‚ÄúDoes this dress make my ass look big?‚Äù The Candide would answer ‚ÄúNo my dear, it is your big ass that makes your ass look big.‚Äù Most husbands would choose their words wisely, but that may not mean the unvarnished truth. For your Bible readers, there is the teaching about it not being the words of a man that matters, but his deeds. By his works he shall be known, I think. I am the Layabout so I have few works, but many words üôÇ

                I think that‚Äôs unfair. For example, many states have legalized marijuana for medical use. As soon as I found out, I got a license and am now proudly part of the millions helping in the search for a medical use üòÄIn seriousness, Marijuana is one of the least dangerous drugs.

                    Ben, that remains to be seen.  The argument that it‚Äôs better than alcohol is fallacious, or at least factious.  It certainly is better than say, that synthetic heroin,krokodil,they use in Russia or meth.  But does that mean we need another drug or more soma for our already dull witted teenaged population?We‚Äôve had 10,000 years to get used to alcohol and we know what the effects are.  We know how potent it can get‚Äî200 Proof, or 100% (usually not better than 196 proof with moisture).  Marijuana on the other hand is not what we had even in the 70‚Äôs with most stores now offering double digit percentage THC plants.  Not to mention concentrations produced by distillation‚Äîhash oil. And of course, any number of youth have died or gotten sick through illegal THC vaping modules.Already we‚Äôve seen reports on the candies and cookies made with THC in them.  Some States I believe have outlawed such for sale.  There are any number of studies which seem now to be indicating that daily use, especially with young minds may indeed lead to reduced cognitive ability.  Of course, that always get tricky wrt cause and effect. (With joggers, how can you tell?)But I will agree, it probably no longer possible to reduce use through criminalization, but I refuse to tout it‚Äôs ‚Äúmerits‚Äù,
