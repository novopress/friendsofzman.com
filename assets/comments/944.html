        And Jacobinism descends from Rousseau, who is the very personification of anti-science.

            True, but Rousseauian is too hard to spell and say. I suppose we can go further back and call them the Sons of Hobbes, but that would be unfair to Hobbes.

        Nothing new here. Pretty sure everyone – including liberals – understands that nature and genetics play a large role in personality and ability. Some scientists believe that 60 percent of our personality is set at birth. I believe it. The big question is how to structure a society where everyone – including those without market valued skills – can support themselves. A society is measured by how it treats it’s weakest members.

            Jacobins were OK with nature over nurture as long as they could murder the people that did not fit the plan. Once that fell out of fashion, they dropped the nature arguments. They have even erased heros like Margaret Sanger from their history books.
