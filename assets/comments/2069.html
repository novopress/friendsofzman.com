        To answer Anon up top, This country doesn’t suck, the country is great.  It’s after you cross over into the cities that the suckage begins to pile up.How foolish would you think me if I say that I believe that only a rebirth of religion and belief in God can save this nation.  But not the namby pamby “turn the other cheek” type but a hotter, militant style. I want a crusade.People who believe in nothing cannot win against those who believe, the left has chosen it’s god, whose feet of clay are crumbling.  The Islamist have very strong belief, and very little else, and have proven harder to kill than a cockroach.In God we trust.

        I agree completely that the progressives/dems are religious (anti-Christian) and hold to no creed except, “Their end or “intention” justifies ANY means”. A huge problem, IMO, we aware conservatives have is there are millions of Americans who do not pay much attention to politics, or hard news, except for what they read in the paper or see on the alphabet news. They vote pretty much like the lofo’s, for the most handsome candidate or not at all. These people that I know are just beginning to wake up, but they still do not want to be bothered and they are not ‘awake’ enough to take any action, YET. Somehow they must be awakened and motivated or the ruling elite will only continue along their path to the destruction of America as we loved her.
