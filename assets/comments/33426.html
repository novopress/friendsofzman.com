        Seems to me the problem in the USA (and the rest of the Western empire) is not about acknowledging the inequality of people within the same ethnic group — I think most everyone is fine with that. The problem seems to be acknowledging inequality between different ethnic groups. Even in the face of incontrovertible statistical evidence of differing crime rates, educational levels, career trajectories, family formation, and so on. And since the evidence cannot be faced up to, the alternative is a sort of magical thinking: inter-ethnic inequality cannot be there, and so it must not be there. It can be willed away, brushed under the rug.

            Exactly. The problem isn’t our inability to acknowledge inequality; it’s our inability to acknowledge inequality among various races. This returns to my point that the founders screwed up for not answering the basic question of any organization: Who are we?

                Right?
The progs/Marxists/libs want to claim that the, “the American people,” are everyone on Earth.
If that were true, then no one would be an American person.

                I at least partially disagree with this.  The managerial class believes in equality among all individuals, perhaps with only minor exceptions.  We spend enormous resources on this fantasy.
The fundamental belief in equality (and magical thinking) is what drives universal education, for example.  It is deeply ingrained in education.  If a kid fails a grade, the problem isn’t the IQ or work ethnic of the kid, it’s that the school somehow failed him.  Given the right method of instruction, there is no subject he cannot master.  This is why they always attack the concept of IQ.

                    I think Managerial class believes in equality amongst all individuals except for Whites. In the case of Poor Whites, they deserve to be where they are because Meritocracy.
The Managerialists *know* that they are ‘better’ than the snaggletoothed pickup-driving yahoo up in the backwoods mountains and have no problem trumpeting the fact.

                I disagree that most acknowledge inequality among individuals.  The fantasy that everyone can be a high achiever at anything given enough time and effort is deeply ingrained.  With the sole exception of sports/athletics, most Whites (in AINO/Canda/UK/AU/NZ) vociferously deny that intellectual and even social gifts are not evenly distributed.  When over half the class at a Christian school achieves ‘high academic honors,’ no one questions that perhaps standards might be made more demanding or restrictive – the parents all celebrate their budding geniuses.  The mostly-White upper class in mixed societies (most of Latin America) is the only group that – despite the usual equality rhetoric – does not fall prey to this.  They are almost all mixed – between 5-15% non-White – and they have lived (and generally prospered) with the reality of unequal ‘gifts’ – of all types – along with the unequal outcomes.But tell that to the AINO White who cheers for the black or down syndrome ‘Homecoming Queen.’  It’s not simple charity or kindness you witness, but instead that deep-seated desire that everyone, no matter his genetic inheritance or economic circumstances, can be a ‘winner.’  Same reason they fight age and death so determinedly – to acquiesce to life’s limitations would mean facing and accepting reality – and man’s place in the hierarchy of Heaven and Earth.

                    Not to put too fine a point on it, but I think much the same for, “but is this good for the White race?”
Whites are not all equal. What is good for one is not going to be good for another. And it’s a fool’s errand to even try. One way or another, fools will eventually be the ones making the decisions.

                This was actually supposed to be a response to Arshad’s post but it works for CSC’s as well.One aspect of the modern Leftist mentality that has always seemed bizarre to me is their extremely strong tendency to compartmentalize information. For instance, most Lefties are hardcore believers in the basic story of human evolution. If you go into the details of that you find that some human groups have been separated completely from one another by thousands of miles and as much as 40,000 years. If you understand evolution at all you can see that it would be extremely shocking if the various races of humans werenotquite different in personality and intelligence just as they differ physically. In fact, even Lefties admit readily that they differ dramatically inphysicalqualities like skin tone and average height. This, in itself though, is a throwback to the mind-matter dualism and spiritualism that most of them reject.None of this makes any logical sense. It may simply be that evolution, or what most Lefties think evolution is, is embraced not so much as body of facts and theory that must be assimilated but as a weapon to be used in their fights with traditionalists and religious believers. When they aren’t battling a specific type of right wing religious person, it’s as though evolution doesn’t exist or at least doesn’t touch on anything they fervently believe in.

            Racial differences are the key issue in the problem of Equality.  The Founding Fathers ASSUMED a European Christian population of Good Moral Character, not the Camp of Saints which is currently washing up on our shores.

                And we all know what happens when you assume.
Do not assume. Make explicit. If the Founders had done that, America would probably still be alive and well.

                    I hear ya, but really —cut the Founders some slack.  A fish doesn’t know it swims in water.  Second point, the Founders could not predict the bastardization of the common meaning of language and therefore interpretation.  If the Constitution were to be rewritten today in the spirit that it was intended to be “understood” in the Founder’s time, it would be a thousand page document and therefore unknowable by the common people.

                    America had multiple revolutions in its time, and it was only sometimes accompanied by a Constitutional Amendment. After Civil War – yes. FDR’s reign – no. Civil Rights Act was a law, not an amendment.
I dispute the idea that the Founders being explicit would have changed this. After all, they made explicit that there be no income tax, right?

                Well, sort of.  The biggie are the Blacks, but not all would be *well* if this were solved.  Compare Hispanics and you still double your crime rate as compared to Whites.  Sure there is confounding with SES and such, but it’s there if one simply looks back to their homelands.  I won’t even comment upon Middle Eastern immigrants.

                            But they are such bigger problems.  Blacks bring a generalized chaos through their dumb decisions, criminality and grievance. But Muslims bring a whole different and worse set of problems.  Look at the grooming gangs in the UK. Deliberately targeting White girls while protecting and limiting their own children.  They are smarter and better organized than blacks too.  They are, from what I can tell, as tribal as blacks.  When a Muslim is arrested in the UK, it’s not uncommon for a thousand Muslims to show up at the police station and demand their release.   Then there is the constant agitation for Islam to play a public role in their “new society. ”Perhaps it is just the devil I know and lack of familiarity coloring my opinion?

                                No, your insight is well taken on today’s Muslim.  But the radicalism is much more recent wrt Islam.  Your most populous Muslim nation is….Indonesia (IIRC).  Anyone hear of the same shenanigans over there?  Not defending Islam as much as criticizing radical religiosity.

                                That’s a fair point. You can’t have a clash of civilizations with a people who are fundamentally uncivilized. And while one may have some respect for the notionally civilized–Sand Hutus–they are also potentially more dangerous. Negroes are incapable of coming up with a fiendish plot such as 9/11, let alone executing it.

                    True enough, but when all the White jackoffs were yammering about their “brothers and sisters” back in the ‘60’s &amp; 70’s, they were only referring to blacks – not Indians (feather and dot), not mexicans, not chinese, japs or muslims.  They, as a group, are the absolute center of the equality/inequality issue that all the bogus laws, amendments and court decrees have been based on and we all have to pretend there is no intellectual inferiority or proclivity towards violence and criminality.  But I hear you on messcins – I’ve lived around them my whole life.

                Yes – that ethnic group that weaponized all the others to destroy White, formerly Christian societies.  The group that demands they are both special and equal simultaneously, and don’t you dare notice otherwise.  This in no way absolves blacks, mestizos, east/south asians of their anti-White animus, but without the power and money (international and hundreds of years’ old) of the chosen, people’s natural sense of identity and family preference would quickly smash the lie of both individual and racial egaliltarianism.

Rule of thumb for how broken a formerly Western country is might be the murder rate: France has one of the highest in Europe.

            Every empire, over time no longer serves its citizens.  They are supplanted by international interests, same happens with the corporations who conquer the domestic market.  Fighting over cultural issues is just cover, an excuse to keep the charade of “democracy” semi believable.  The rich care not about abortion, or your 4.0 GPA average from state school rah rah rah, they just want you to accept the way things are and shut up.  We often find ourselves asking, why would you promote stupid?  The answer is because you’ll spend all your time fighting the stupid, while they continue to loot anything left of value before the whole thing goes ka-boom.

                The ruling class of the Roman Republic was in the process of self-destruction even during the transition from republic to empire. Ethnic Romansin the ruling class of the empirewere gradually replaced by non-Roman provincials with self-interest in its continuation. (1) The Roman people, the working class, were doomed the moment they had no ethnocentric organizers. The late stage empire saw Roman farmers evicted from their farms to make way demobbed legionaries when there was no longer any new conquered territory on which to settle them.At least they were mostly admixed with Germans and Greeks to eventually become Italians. We are getting the variegated genetic trash of the Earth while Jewish media encourages white women to breed with them. That in itself is a strong natural selection process removing from the white gene pool lack of instinctual revulsion for miscegenation.(1) “Race Mixture in the Roman Empire”, Tenney Frank, The American Historical Review, Vol. XXI, #4, July 1916.

                    True, and an aspect that most who study Roman History never mention but i think it applies:  They capped their source of cheap energy (slaves) when Augustus decided the empire should no longer expand after Varus lost his legions.

                Every race seems to have its “race hustlers” or “grifters”.  They of course, need to promote racism to guilt Whites into forking over the loot.  But there is also, it seems, a fairly universal reason to put the blame for inequality on racism—refusal to be held accountable for one’s place/status in society.  Much easier to blame others than look within yourself for solution/cause.

            Perhaps just as important is the inability to acknowledge the inequality of sexes; i.e., men and women are interchangeable except for reproductive plumbing and secondary sexual characteristics.  Advancing women into positions for which they are completely unsuited leads to a lot of unhappiness and is one of the major reasons for the cratering fertility that the Z-man mentioned last week.  It may, in the long run, prove more pernicious than the failure to acknowledge inequality between races.

            They won’t even admit race exists, let alone differences across race.  Pay attention to the way they talk about it.  Most of them deny race altogether or define race as skin and other superficial physical differences.  But these minor differences just happen to coincide with race making it easy to “see” race.  They appeal to our sense of fairness based on this ridiculous assumption.  “What if you had more melanin and were black?”  This leaves out that if you were black, you wouldn’t be you.  We’ve been cursed with having our racial diversity being between Europeans and Africans as opposed Europeans and East Asians.

This kindergarten level construct is easily one of the most destructive in modern conversation. Literally nobody cares about skin color, nor do does anyone “hate it” like they hate a red coat for a blue one. It’s about the behavior patterns easily spotted in relationship to melanin levels.
The focus on the melanin levels prevents the conversation from happening entirely.

                Disparate impact is the alleged result. The evidence that supports the thesis. You can’t remove it or ban it, as it is just an observable black box output. Look around any neighborhood. The kind of people there are determines what kind of neighborhood you have.
What we have to figure out how to explain is that black box inputs were the cause of the output, rather than the black box.

            Yes. The underlying assumption of the “ glory days” of the Civil Rights movement was that race “ inequality “ was a white man’s problem. Once we “ leveled the playing field” of any exterior barrier, the natural equality of the black minority would naturally emerge. Decades on, it didn’t.It simply doesn’t exist, whether by “ nature or nurture”.And Jefferson knew that too.

                “a white man’s problem”
Yes. I’ll add that there was a further assumption held by white reformers was that the non-white races shared the reformer’s desire to see each person as an individual, not as a member of a competing tribe. The white reformer expected that the other races would reciprocate the desire to move past a world of competing races, which didn’t happen.
Whites were like pacifists who threw away their weapons on the assumption that every other competing group wanted a world without fighting, but no other group threw down their weapons.

                    The egalitarian dogma has always held that Whites were uniquely and specially racist while other groups had the “correct” view that everyone was the same. In today’s Grievance Studies “literature” you see this fully developed into a kind of secular notion of original sin that only applies to Whites.Of course, the reality is just the opposite. Whites are virtually theonlyrace that falls for stupid and self destructive racial altruism. Every other race looks after its own and maintains a certain degree of hostility to other races. Of course, this is exactly what evolution would predict since favoring your own near-kin is a good way to pass on your genes. The only real mystery is why and how Whites broke from this general tendency.

The Founding Fathers justified their rebellion based on rights that they denied others (tge Whiskey rebellion).
But  saying the truth was not pretty. It was easier to say “all men are created equal”. This only means:”nobles don’t have better blood than burgeois”. But after this was taught in schools as the higher good for centuries, the rhetoric took over

                It appears in context that Jefferson meant “Our aristocrats on this side of the pond are equal to your aristocrats”. It was not a general equality of men, at least given his life.The War for Independence makes no sense without that immediate context of the French and Indian war that had just been fought.The British would ignore even basic advise from colonials on weather and the locals, simply because they were colonials. “Yankee Doodle Dandy” was written by a British MD mocking the Americans he met. George Washington would only be allowed captain, I believe simply because he was born here in the US. In many ways, a generation of intense British snobbery shaped the course of history.

                    Yes. Fred Anderson’s Crucible of War, for example, makes a compelling case that the British condescension toward the colonials during the French and Indian War set the stage for exactly the kind of assertion of equal aristocracy you describe.
But that condescension extended to the common man as well. The British regular infantry was typically seen as superior to their undisciplined colonial counterparts, who were frequently assigned the most menial tasks.

                        The “colonials” had been planning separation for a long time.The excuses used such as equality or snobbery were justifications for the local elite to seize power from the distant elite.
Also, Jefferson or Washington whining about having their feelings hurt is kinda funny considering their misanthropic tendencies.

                            Sure.  In Anderson’s telling and in that of most honest historians the founding generation comes off as just as venal, hypocritical, sanctimonious, scheming, etc. as any other generation.  They were, in other words, human.
Doesn’t change the fact that British attitudes toward them helped fuel the revolutionary situation.

        I remember seeing a commercial for one of those for-profit colleges that said something like “talent is distributed equally, opportunity is not.” I remember being totally shocked that someone would say something so dumb, even in an advertisement. It’s so obviously untrue and silly that we might as well say that we are all born with zebra stripes. Yet, I looked on the internet and found that this is actually a pretty common saying in certain circles. It seems like something people say to signal they are part of the group, but as with every other thing taht these people say, there are a fair number of true believers in that group as well. As Z points out, some of those true believers just happen to be in the Supreme Court. It’s also the dogma of not just liberals but conservatives. Liberals might just want to hire black lesbians for everything (especially fire departments), but conservatives want to hire BASED black lesbians for everything.

            ‘Talent is distributed equally’ is a religious phrase repeated by adherents of the Church of Prog.  They ignore the evidence of reality before them — that talent is distributed very unequally — and choose instead to believe a convenient lie.  Cult behavior.

                An NBA based on measurable ability would be far less black, basketball nerds found out when they started taking their stats as seriously as baseball nerds do.
So the nerds STFU and GTFO, lest they be pantsed. That’s a significant part of the league’s declining popularity, and the ever-increasing “diversity” of its remnant audience.
A league with just as many stars from Serbia and Peoria as from the ghetto (they’re not, but that’s the story) would be a more successful business, but American corporations aren’t in the business business.

        Jamestown is the oldest English colony in the New World. It was founded on the belief that Englishmen would continue to live as they always had, but in the New World. It is the foundation of The South and Red State America. Both the plantation owner replicating a facsimile of the medieval manor and the hillbilly vanishing into the mountains come from these men.A decade later Puritans arrived a few hundred miles north (and on the other side of the Dutch). They would create a city on the hill cleansed of the Old World and its Catholic Church. A new Zion, and religion would carry them even though these urban dwelling middle class people didn’t know how to farm. This is the founding of New England and Blue State America. The social justice warrior looking for Old Scratch in the housing market and the NGO employee on the frontline of the post WW2 order are their descendents.Unfortunately, only one of these groups could run a navy and they strangled the first group.

                The Puritans (rather than the southern Calivers) won Mr. Lincoln’s War. Thus they won the “rights” to the origin story of the US. Thanksgiving, while very wholesome in it’s nature, is about very much about resetting the US’s orgin story. (Thanksgiving was also started by Lincoln and I think not very much celebrated in the South for a long time.)It’s the world’s dumbest origin story, too. It’s about a group of people unable to navigate to Virginia lucky enough to stumble on some natives that let them survive until the next summer. But yipee I guess.

                Howard, it’s worse than that.  The 1619 Leftist crowd are well aware of the date of the Jamestown founding.  1619 is said to be the date of the first import of African slaves into the future USA.  Therefore it is the date of our “original sin” and all US history begins there.  Our nation was conceived in sin and the Left has been preaching (White) repentance ever since.

        A return to the right to free association would solve some of the problems we have created. The Z man has written about this and our original states practiced it, the people of Pennsylvania or Maryland were free to be different than the people of Rhode Island or Massachussets to the point of excluding people whom did not accept the state religion of those states.We had it at the beginning, we need to return to some form of free association rights again.

            Only White people are not allowed to have free association. Every other group can associate with their own people in any way they see fit. I just read an article about how Indians are pushing back against anti-caste discrimination laws. They want the ability not just to come here, not just to bring over their entire family down to the 18th cousin, not just to bring over all the people of lower caste so they can rule over them with an iron fist, but also the ability to do so legally – and they’re doing it. It’s only racist if a White person complains about it.All this goes back to the core issue. It doesn’treallymatter what the law says. What matters is what theregimesays, and it says that Whites are second class citizens that need to be destroyed. The law will be used as a cudgel to do that, and it does it both ways (by enforcing these statutes against Whites and not enforcing it against non-Whites).

        Agree, but the founders also screwed by not answering the ultimate question of any organization: Who are we?
They never laid out just what was an American, or, at least, they didn’t make it explicit. Yes, they said free white men and our posterity, but they never addressed it directly. In their defense, they probably didn’t see the need.
We are a country that can’t answer that basic question, which means that we aren’t a country.

                The “that’s not who we are!” people usually point to the Emma Lazarus poem and the Israel Zangwill play to tell us “who we are”, not the Founders. The “that’s not who we are!” people hate the Founders.

        Jefferson was well aware of this problem. His words in the Declaration have been misused entirely out of context. Jefferson’s 1813 letter to John Adams deserves to be quoted at length:“…I agree with you that there is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents. Formerly bodily powers gave place among the aristoi. But since the invention of gunpowder has armed the weak as well as the strong with missile death, bodily strength, like beauty, good humor, politeness and other accomplishments, has become but an auxiliary ground of distinction.There is also an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents; for with these it would belong to the first class. The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of the society. May we not even say that that form of government is the best which provides the most effectually for a pure selection of these natural aristoi into the offices of government? The artificial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in government, and provision should be made to prevent it’s ascendancy…”Jefferson and the other Founders sought not simple “equality” of outcome, but merely equality before the law so that those with natural talents (such as themselves) were not held back by the legal structure of the “artificial aristocracy,” i.e. nobles by birth in Europe.Consequently they formed a government of limited and enumerated powers, which had no ability to impose equality upon the population.This ended in 1865, when the Federal government slipped the leash of the Constitution and imposed racial equality upon the South at gunpoint. By the Progressive Era the nation had transitioned from a republic of states into a “democracy,” in which the unequal members of the population could vote for the government to impose equality for their own benefit.The contemporary equality fetishism and democracy fetishism is actually un-American, or at least certainly at odds with the views of the Founders and the spirit of the Constitution of 1787.Contemporary American equalitarianism is really a form of communism.

            The artificial aristocracy was further rebuked by Jefferson in 1826 when he wrote:
“The mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.”
I’ve always liked that thought, but never concluded it meant to support equality of all men.

                Jefferson pointed out to Madison that is not what his Constitution was, though. He warned that Article I, Section 8, clause 1, the ‘general welfare clause” conferred upon Congress plenary power. Anything they could argue was in the “general welfare” was within their purview.
He recommended Madison go back to the wording from the Articles of Confederation — “expressly delegated”. We know how that came out. Which, to me, argues strongly that Madisonet al.wanted a Congress with plenary powers.

He then argued that they must subsequently be deported to their own country…

                        I don’t know. I do know that the Articles held the line very well, though they were only in place for 8 years of peace. Well enough that not only did they have to lie about its flaws, but that those lies became the accepted Truth. The Constitution didn’t make it 2 years before the Whiskey Rebellion, and 3 before the obviously direct carriage tax, resulting in Hylton decision the next year.
The Federalists damned the experiment in federal governance, with their craving for nationalism and power and wealth.

        Thank you for addressing the basic assumption behind ‘woke,’ political correctness, the ‘left,’ and whatever other group of reality-denying misfits you choose.  I would emend your statement that the managerial class is the main reason for AINO’s fantasy – they may be the group with the most overt power, but they are merely the tip of the spear.  Every grunt who counts Jose as his good buddy, ever churchian who welcomes Chien and Oluwa and Sandeep to his neighborhood and ultimately his family, provides the overwhelming numbers and buttresses the managerial class.  All of the readers and commenters with Han or Mestizo wives, with children in the public schools with all sorts of non-White friends.  Everyone who cites NAXALT or IKAGO.  All those who salivate over Sowell, or Carson, or Candace.  The list is endless.  Until/unless Whites once again identify as a people and value that identity and heritage enough to defend it with whatever force or violence is necessary, we will be extinct by the century’s end.

            ‘Every grunt who counts Jose as his good buddy, ever churchian who welcomes Chien and Oluwa and Sandeep to his neighborhood and ultimately his family, provides the overwhelming numbers and buttresses the managerial class’It is so.And yet, the most valuable and effective allies of the managerial class turned out to be the parents — especially the dads — of daughters, who almost to a person steered their princesses away from marriage and children, and towards a Hard Charging Don’t Need No Man career.. . . yea to college, where the educational emphasis was on teaching her to hate, fear, and resent white males, to make endless war against them, and to hold them responsible for all evils in the cosmos.To these I say wash the gore from your own doorstep before setting out to fix the country.

        It sure is a wild coincidence that the solutions proposed by these equality obsessed Europeans always has the effect of ethnically cleansing the West of Euro blood. Its like africans wanting to live authentically, they don’t explicitly think to themselves they want to reduce civilization to dust but that is always the end result of them acting on their genetic will.Some of the founders like Jefferson &amp; Washington believed islamic goatfuckers would be a great fit for America so long as they believed in God &amp; were hard workers, respectively. Some things just never change. Well except the White population but that was always the thing preventing equality that needed to be martyred to achieve the utopia.I think people like Roberts are far more dangerous &amp; subversive than those who ideologically evolved to desire the explicit conclusion of the equality concept. White people stand tall among the savages so they have to go to level the playing field, its really that simple, thats the logic they’re operating under. But for people like Roberts if they acknowledge that they can’t claim to be moral. They see the same things you &amp; I do yet refuse to change course, there’s no point where they will have an epiphany, their destination is the same one the Left wants but slower &amp; with a false veneer of moral moderation.Its no surprise that these sorts of people always side with savages over traditional Whites when push comes to shove. They’d tell you thats just a coincidence because acknowledging patterns of any sort is the thread that if tugged can totally unravel their childish worldview.

        I’d say it’s more accurate to consider the real problem to be, not so much that Nature distributes her gifts unequally, but that she does not distribute them randomly. I think the American project could happily manage a random distribution of gifts, but because blacks are a cursed race, they will always be greatly underrepresented in any endeavor not involving running, jumping, or chaotic violence.
Thus their claim that the very nature of a White society and a White society’s rule are by their nature, racist. They are entirely correct in this claim

            Yet we can all see that “equality before God and the law” that you praise was not a stable cultural belief. Instead, “equality before God and the law” became “bake the cake bigot” and “you’ll be fired if you don’t use the tranny’s pronouns.”
Why was “equality before God and the law” so easily defeated?
Whites seem to have acquired a willful blindness, a suicidal naiveté, about non-whites. My guess is that our unique compassion and love for abstraction made us vulnerable to a blind universalism, which was exploited by those who mostly control our media.

        ‘Simply acknowledging objective reality about human beings would solve many of the problems in present day America, but it is impossible.’Sadly, correct. Facing reality would cause Hurt Feewings doncha know, and already Hurt Feewings will get you a long jail term in Britain.Equality exists exactly nowhere on Earth or in heaven, and yet is the spiritual and legal cornerstone of America.Not a good plan.One man is not equal to the next; this isn’t the business of ‘Mother Nature’, because she doesn’t exist. It is the business of God the Father, who bestows His gifts AS HE WILL, according to His own wisdom, often through the mechanism of ‘Nature’.Women are not ‘equal’ to men and never will be. Men and women were created for different roles and purposes. Making them ‘equal’ is — as New Amerika has demonstrated — effectively to make the feminine supreme. Then you burn yourselves down. Can you say ‘Eaton Fire’?All phenomenal things are hierarchic, including the Host of Heaven. The Left or Collective Feminine hate that and strive with all their might to overthrow hierarchy and heaven both.The hate-white-males Affirmative Action Amerika of the past five decades — a disease which is quickly killing you — extends directly from the worship of Holy Equality and its judicial enshrinements.The Adversary gave the world the concept of egalitarianism and did so primarily via the Jacobins. You base your law and nation on their agenda, you’re gonna lose.

        You can’t lay this on Jefferson — he believed in natural aristocracy, one of virtue and talent, versus the artificial aristocracy of family status. The problem arose when men who on their best days aspire to mediocrity want to include themselves in this natural aristocracy.
Roberts is one of millions of such. Midwits believe that they are of the natural aristocracy simply because they hold a government office. They are Federalists. Or maybe their hangers-on. You see around you not the detritus of Jeffersonian “equality”, but of Federalist hogwash that the virtuous are elevated to office.

        They didn’t believe in the equality of all. They demanded equality before the law, because Britain did not hold them as equals under the law. Even that was aristocratic. They were not lords and so they were not treated as nobles by the law. To get farm boys and trappers and Hessian mercenaries and blacksmiths to sign up for their revolution they promised them freedom and equality before the law.America’s problem was it became a mercantile empire that thought, ‘Hey! we can just import more people to do more jobs and we can keep growing!’ Now look at the grotesquely disfigured human landscape all around you. Even amongst the original ethnicities that were here the disputes and tension were never resolved. Well, when they were properly managed a new group of revolutionaries came on the scene. ‘Hey! We need to convince non-White third worlders that our form of managerialism is better than the Soviets so we can get them as our satraps. We’ll renounce our race, our culture and our colonizing past so we can institute a global colony and bring them into its local managers.’In so doing, they began the process of liquidating their core ethnos, their culture, their history, their legacy. The liquidation is accelerating. Trump ’24 was, to the American ethnos, about halting and reversing the liquidation. Trump is an imperial mercantilist. On the one hand, he genuinely feels and understands the issue in his bones. On the other, in his bones is not conscious enough. What he consciously understands is America must be number one economically and militaristically because – well because.A sense of being a people has always haunted what has turned out to be the greatest tragedy in all of human history – the failed American experiment. In the 1920s they knew what needed to be done. They did it. Then, forty years later, it was undone and that first pull of the thread is unraveling into incoherent knots and nests. You can loot the quiet smoldering battlefield when you keep it unraveling.How many Americans will see things how they are and want to forge a real nation – a cohesive people? We had an elite who provided the grounds for that in the 20s. Now, we are on our own.It wasn’t egalitarianism that undid America. It was mercantilist imperialism and a territory where radical experiments with human populations were and are being done at its behest.

        I disagree a bit. Aspirational equality, for want of a better term, was supplanted by legally enforced non-discrimination only after World War II. As you point out, profession of the creedal variety prior to that point was more ritualistic than a reflection of actual belief. Even as much as I loathe the Puritan, when you read the works of abolitionists, to cite on example, they almost all fully expected blacks to be repatriated to Africa. The professed beliefs were not sincerely held, in short.The transition to the current fantastical legal regime actually started with KRAMER, which ended restrictive racial covenants in land transfers, and that predated the fatal blow of BROWN. Prior to KRAMER/BROWN, the creedal hypocrites knew full well disaster would ensue if the aspiration became legally required.I am optimistic, actually, that this madness will end largely due to the madness KRAMER wrought. People intuitively know the truth and are self-sorting at accelerating rates. Los Angeles burning is only the most recent spectacular event to speed these things along. Thomas Jefferson said a lot of shit, but he would have fully expected what happened and lived in such a way that indicated as much. His successors are increasingly the same. Voting with their feet is only the first phase.eta: This was beautifully written.

            How does the next stage of forced busing factor into your optimism? By that I mean, dumping tens of thousands of aliens, not just from your own country but from anywhere in any part of the world, into your home town, countryside … …It certainly ends all talk of an experiment and opens things up as another historical case of malevolent despots resettling a new people to dispose of the old ones.It is not at all clear that being rid of Mayorkas, if we are even rid of him now that he is slithering back to HIAS or some other colonizer’s racket, is going to rid us of that problem.

                Fair. The new round of bussing does make things worse. The biggest obstacle to overcome, though, is mental. That has started to happen, and I never thought it would. In some ways, many not pleasant, the invaders will be relatively easy to check, but that could not happen previously. The problem is Mayorkas and his ilk and the mindset that allowed them to flourish.

        Speaking of inequality of IQ and achievement within the same race, different brains seem to work differently. For instance, although I don’t consider myself particularly stupid, any sort of basic arithmetic or math simply cannot “sink into” my grey matter. No amount of after-school tutoring helped. Straight “F’s” year after year. Even though I did okay in other subjects, they kept flunking me until I finally dropped out. On the other hand, for some natural reason, I can master any musical instrument that touches my hands or mouth, even though I’ve never had formal lessons and can’t read a note of music. Also, I’ve been a big-game hunter my entire adult life (I’m now 73 and still hunt every year). And wherever I trek on foot, whether it’s the thickets of Florida’s Big Cypress Swamp, or Idaho’s densely-forested mountains, I have never gotten lost, no matter how many miles I wander, deeply engrossed in tracking my quarry. When the sun is getting low, I simply turn around and head back to camp or my vehicle. No compass, map, or GPS. When my buddies ask how I do it, I can only reply, “That’s how my brain works!” Inferior in some ways, “superior?” in others?

        “If the court said that Harvard is a private college and so it can admit who it likes for any reason it likes, this case never sees a courtroom. Public universities, on the other hand, must admit everyone that meets the objective criteria for admissions. Debates over college admissions would vanish instantly.”Not so!  What would happen is hundreds of private colleges would spring up allowing high performance students to gain entry.  State schools would see a massive outflow of talent, and their racial demographic would shift to the point where a visitor could be forgiven for thinking they woke up in a third world country.And the great battle over free association would quickly reignite.The problem with equality is the conflation of the equality of our immortal souls before God with the equality of corporeal outcomes among men.  Most of our problems today arise from the attempt to force the same outcomes, regardless of ability.And that is quite impossible.  I was a high school math and physics teacher.  What did the black principal try to do?  Eliminate all grades on homework and quizzes because the black students refused to do them.  He cited all kinds of excuses, but it was plainly clear that white and Asian kids would largely do their work and that other demographics would not. His solution?  Collapse the roof of the building and harm everyone equally.Because of human nature, equality of outcome by definition means lowering the standard so low that everyone can meet it.  It’s so shockingly simple that even the most die hard DIE advocates have to twist themselves in knots pretending reality is not so.

        Excellent. The Enlightenment notion of equality, which never meant equality, of course, and never could, has been an engine of positive change but in the end, the anti-natural assumption at the heart of it now produces nothing but misery and insanity.
I realized that 15 years ago on reading Kurt Vonnegut’s (1961!!!)Harrison Bergeron,when it became clear that the natural inequality of man could only be overcome by an ever metastasizing police state. Which we now have.

        So, is there a system that acknowledges these natural inequalities and works with them? Given that might makes right in any environment, what would work best?
Or maybe I am asking the wrong question. We should be asking something else. What is good for our people? What is good for Whites? Most of the problem with “discrimination” immediately resolves itself. Or am I taking the wrong direction here?

            Good question, but I would point out that we brought the schism with us, the southern migration from Jamestown and the Chesapeake was founded by men firmly grounded in reality, while New England was settled by religious outcasts and their ilk. Unfortunately the “Idealists”won the inevitable war and are now leading us over the cliff into Brackens’ Buffalo jump.

            Not so sure there is a particular “one size fits all” system.  It is more the quality of the people running that system, and what safeguards can you put in to get/keep those types of people in power.  A meritocracy type system seems closest, but who would sacrifice for a cold meritocracy? You can’t really get a away from blood and soil – its simply built into human nature.Seems that one safeguard would be a strong freedom of association right.  For too long, FOA has given way to “equality” when they clash – it needs to be the other way.  As Zman suggests, only direct government activity should be subject to a limited form of equality of opportunity – that is, if you meet certain objective merit based qualifications, you are eligible for this or that government run thing.  If you are a private institution/business, you can do as you please.  The trickier part is where a private business is entangled with the government – basically government contractors.  To what extent can the government demand compliance with its “equality” objectives?

You aren’t told you must sacrifice for your garbageman or your plumber or your mechanic. They are just providing a service that you can’t produce for yourself on a cost-effective basis. Why should you sacrifice for neocon warmongers who provide the service of foreign relations? Or a judicial system that provides the service of injustice?

                Nobody will sacrifice for meritocracy. People are only willing to die for God, nation or ideology. As long as they believe.
At the risk of sounding edgy, the only system that may work is some sort of nationalist monarchy or nationalist and somewhat totalitarian system (similar to what they have in China, but with God)

        It goes back to Luther’s Sola Scriptura: the idea than anyone, without knowing Greek or Hebrew, nor which texts are canonical because a canon is extra-Biblical, can read the Bible on his own, including Luther’s tendentious translation that omitted James, Revelation and other books, and come to the divine truth infallibly.

            I think it starts with monotheism. In a world of competing gods, there are competing moral frameworks. In a world of one god, there must be one set of rules for how that god wants us to live. it then follows that those rules must apply equally to all men.

                That competing moral framework is exactly what we’re witnessing now with the end of the GAE. The rise of China, Russia and even Iran isn’t just geo-politics or economic; it’s a competing moral framework for how to organize a society and what a society finds good or bad.Russia’s belief in traditional values is as much a threat to GAE as the Oreshnik. China’s belief in no immigration hurts GAE as much as its manufacturing capacity. That Russia and China can exist, prosper and, especially, stand up to GAE is proof that their moral framework is a good as the West’s.But the West believes in one God, so that can’t be true, which is why the US finds their rise and stability to be an existential threat.

                I don’t think it starts with either religion or scriptural interpretation.
It starts with the discovery and exploration of the Western Hemisphere, and the effect this had on the minds of men.  Had Europeans stayed in Europe we wouldn’t be in this mess.
The idea of land without end led to the prideful notion that natural limits, which everyone had heretofore recognized, could be transcended.
1492 began this most Faustian of all baragains.

                This. The cause has to precede the effect. So if we were to find such effects prior to Luther, at best, one could argue that effect was caused by the same thing that caused Luther. And, obviously…
Same with the Age of Exploration.
The same thing applies to the one man, one vote of Athens, though, and they were not monotheistic. There’s a deeper cause somewhere.

                        I’ve been reading Peirce lately and had in mind his idea that the ultimate result of inquiry must be consensus — because the a priori logic of inquiry and the notion of truth itself requires it.

                            Not gainsaying that. Just the “one universal truth” bit. The truth will be objective and materialistic, sure, but will require careful formulation of the question that truth is the answer to.
Will it all come down to GUT? Who knows? It’s a matter of faith.

                                My use of the word “universal” might have been unfortunate if it suggested something like a Theory of Everything. All I meant by it is contained in the idea of reproducible experiments. Because we are in the same, one world where the same laws apply, you can get the same results as me if you test under the same conditions. The truth established through such experimentation thus commands assent by all rational inquirers — and that is the sense in which it is universal.This idea of one common reality is not new with Peirce, of course. It goes back to the classical Greeks at least and probably further. I brought it up in response to our host’s mention of monotheism, because I think it functions similarly.

        How odd that in the so-called “open society” discrimination is not only accepted but often mandated just so long as the victims of discrimination are white or northeast Asian. Discrimination and openness, alas, really are not the issues. The racism of the Power Structure and its desire for retribution against the Blue-Eyed Ice Devils, are.

        The typical attitude of the average American is that he wants legal equality, i.e., no class of people above the law. After that, let the chips fall where they may. Some people will prosper more than others and that is fine. That impulse has been perverted by our rulers into an attempt to make everyone equal in every way. It’s a fool’s errand but it has granted them immense power over us and has ironically produced even more of the inequality they claim to deplore.

        Beautifully written essay!  But my understanding of the Harvard case is a little different….Justice Roberts and the majority relied on US law, which generally forbids racial discrimination based on race for schools receiving Federal money…Private schools not receiving such cash are free to do what they want….Harvard, of course, gets loads of Federal money..The Court has carved out narrow exceptions for limited periods of time and specific purposes, which certainly would not characterize Harvard’s admissions policy, which admitted 1400% more blacks and 500% more jews than a race blind policy would admit..(The previous contrary decision relied on Sandra Day O’Connor’s rationale that the upper classes needed to rub shoulders with the serfs).Consequently, Harvard’s policy is Illegal…The Court, without doubt, took this case to overturn the (insulting) previous decision…I communicated this to some folks at Harvard..It appears, contrary to some news reports, that Harvard is attempting to comply with the decision, but is also using the justification of life experience to evade racial issues…

            Which colleges/universities are not receiving federal money?  At a minimum, you are going to have students with federally guaranteed loans (personally, I don’t think that should count as “federal” money since it will ostensibly have to be repaid).
I can’t think of single one (Rice University used to be for White males only, funded by a trust – but then it wanted to dip into the federal trough).

        People need to be brought to the yoke— to be civilized. It’s an ocean of blood that’s gone into it, if we’re being honest. Lots of high-minded justification required to mask the fact.Hierarchy tends to the big— it wants to get bigger, imperial. Justified, it becomes its own cause.We’re a people with a long history of resenting the yoke, long before we became Americans. Our egalitarian streak also apparently needs high-minded justification, also became its own cause, also, strangely, ended up in the same big place.There’s that idealism again, wanting to be big and universal, always asking WHY? Maybe good enough to say we don’t like being ruled over, will only tolerate as much as we have to, that’s why. Maybe there’s confusion of idea and will, or something like that.

                As Bob Dylan sang during his mercifully one-off “Spiritual” LP, “You’re gonna serve somebody. It may be the Devil, or it may be the Lord…”Apparently a third option did not occur to him: that we must obey Nature (by which I mean the manifest laws of the physical universe). Indeed, we don’t have any choice in the matter. You are at liberty to obey or not any system of man-created “law.” or even to defy God’s (that darn free will). I’m pretty sure that you don’t have the option to not obey the Law of Gravity if you jump out a window.

            “Maybe good enough to say we don’t like being ruled over, will only tolerate as much as we have to,”Certainly, but it should be (to me) a bit more nuanced.  No one—Whites anyway—argues for legalized killing (murder).  Whereas just about everyone seems to hate HMO’s.  Why?Laws can broadly be divided into two types:“mala in se and mala prohibita”.The first in general are morally repugnant (White morality) and most folks are in general agreement as to the importance of prohibition and the laws enforcing such. The second are what’s inflicted upon us by an overweening bureaucracy (which we discuss here quite often) and often a plague upon decent (White) people.I use this distinction precisely because it leads into the differences among races, immigration, and multiculturalism society.

            Remembering that book about the Scots, especially the Highland Clearances. The modern thing is using economics instead of conquest to civilize. No less effective, it seems.
Might be a reach to think about the nature of money, or maybe not. People on here talk about an evolutionary bottleneck, and maybe that’s it. We’re a warlike people, but we haven’t developed immunity to money and stuff, so to speak. Very hard to conquer, but easily bought off.

        America’s rhetoric of equality isn’t as dissonant with factual or natural inequality as it is with Americans’ idea of justice, which is the same as everybody’s:Someone else gets screwed and I get to watch.For example, the conservative’s knowledge of systemic anti-whiteness in all matters public and official—of state, church, and “the market”—vanishes from his mind whenever he’s given a chance to call white people losers. What the system gives John Q Republican isthat chance. It’s his compensation for the erasure of his history—and a solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short life for his posterity. The memetic “boomer” isthis.(Ironically, Musk’s and Vivek’s “face reveal” over H1-B is proof that they’re fully assimilated, realer Americans than any native who has a complaint.)The phrase “cognitive dissonance” is almost always misused now—like it’s become an example of itself—but we shouldremember(conservatively) what it actually means, because it was a great insight.In the face of contradiction, reality is discarded.The “someone else” who’s getting screwed isus. We see it, feel it, and know it. So we invent ourselves as an Other, our history as sin and error, our children as unworthy of any inheritance. “White guilt,” “self-hating whites,” etc., arethis.

        All men are not created equal, Korean edition –https://www.koreaexpose.com/korea-anger-driven-crime-social-problem/“On Nov 15, a forty-something Korean woman living in Incheon west of Seoul ended up in a coma after being stabbed in the neck. The culprit was a 48-year-old male neighbor who had been fighting with her and her husband over noise.Two months before that, a man in the southern port city of Yeosu used a knife to kill the couple living above him in the apartment building. The given reason was, again, noise.Complaints over noise in apartment buildings have become a defining feature of the Covid pandemic in Korea. The ubiquitous high-rise residential towers have long been criticized for substandard soundproofing. As more people spend time at home, disputes stemming from unwanted sounds have gone through the roof.Naturally most Korean media reports have focused on the prevalence of such disagreements between neighbors and the absence of solutions. Apartments are poorly built, and the government is helpless to regulate noise inside private dwellings, so what can anyone do?But they overlook an underlying cause: anger and people’s ability to control it. Koreans are waking up to the fact that they live in a deeply angry society, and outbursts are common. Noise from fellow residents is only one reason to let it all out, sometimes to a homicidal conclusion.…..Another phenomenon is customers berating businesses and service workers for the slightest mistake, both off- and online. So-called “black consumers” who exploit merchants have been in the spotlight for leaving bad reviews on the flimsiest of excuses.A widely publicized case last summer involved someone who ordered food on a food delivery app and demanded refund after claiming that one of the fried shrimps had a strange color to it. The request soon turned into insults, and the restaurant owner reportedly suffered a stroke from the stress and died as a result. ….”

            Jefferson was thrilled by the French Revolution. At least early on. Later, as Robespierre became just another tyrant, Jefferson parted ways, and became a harsh critic.
Similar with Paine, but not to the same degree. He loved the way Rights of Man took on the monarch, but not a big fan of its attacks on religion. In Jefferson’s opinion, religion served a critical role in preserving tradition, which was essential to social order. Which is why Jefferson’s version of the Bible retained the philosophy, but discarded the mystical woo-woo. In the end, Jefferson neither endorsed nor condemned RoM.
