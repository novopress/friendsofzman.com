        A big part of the issue is the schools. Because the public schools are war zones, you’ll never get families to live in these areas.
This means that you can only get young hipsters or empty nesters to live in those areas, and they’ll leave at the drop of a hat if crime goes up.
It makes those areas very vulnerable because no one has any real.roots in the neighborhood.

            Both war zones and grift.  One of the guys I rowed with there had two schoolteacher parents.  It was not uncommon for the “vibrant” school system employees to sell items off the loading dock for cash that were meant for the schools.  Say anything about it and said vibrants would arrange to have you “tuned up”.  The whole place was a kleptocracy in the 1980s.

                On YouTube if you search on Detroit schools documentary, among the many choices you’ll find Dan Rather report, nearly 2 hours. Coming from liberal media I thought it quite objective I.e. it delves into the symptoms but it doesn’t explore what caused them.

            The public schools are indeed sh*te and too many White people have yet to wake up to that fact. It’s like they think school is “The Breakfast Club” or how it was in the 1980s when they were there. If you can’t afford a decent Christian/private school, homeschool. Yes, it would be nice to send our kids to White schools paid for by our hard-earned tax dollars, but that is not our current reality. Whites need to assert control over their kids’ education, protect them from anti-white/homosex/trans propaganda, etc.

                True enough. However, the anti-white propaganda is everywhere, not just in the schools. Isolating your kids from it is impossible. What must be done is to teach them to actively combat it.

                    Exactly.  It’s like the “sex talk”—you can have it with your children, or they’ll have it with other children, or worse a public school teacher, and you may not like those answers.
i missed the boat on that a lot, starting with that slimeball Clinton and his WH escapades.  I try to make up for it now that the kids are adults wrt race issues.

                    Besides the propaganda, there is the duty to not force your progeny to live in fear of bullying and harassment by “the jungle” through their formative years.It’s devastating on many accounts.

                            I upvoted because I think that’s largely true, but I sympathize with the Zoomers who are facing $2k a month for a studio apartment. That IS Biden caused. Maybe a tisch of Trump, but the interest rates didn’t start edging up until (probably) everyone lost hope that the Shitstain in Chief wouldn’t be shitting in the Oval Office.
A Zoomer needs a pretty decent income to let his wife stay home.

                Last week, the UK Daily Mail had an excellent piece about this:
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13498083/white-fortress-cities-american-south-wealthy-segregated-communities.html
The UK Daily Mail pointed out that the Neo-Segregationists succeeded in Louisiana, but were thwarted in Georgia by…

you’ll never guess who it was…

THE GEORGIA GOP.
In particular, Brian Kemp.

        There’s no doubt that local color wreaked a ton of havoc, but a lot probably has to do with the deliberate death of manufacturing, as talked about by guys like Perot and Buchanan and now Trump. Blacks worked at Hughes Aircraft and Tools in Los Angeles when it was there, and though Compton was always scruffy, it wasn’t too scruffy for James Coburn or Kevin Costner to call it home back then. Now such a thing would be unthinkable. Most of the untalented 9/10ths of blacks have always been able to do some useful work in the past, before they were weaponized by the Powers That Be. That’s something the Normiecons (sort of) got right: the welfare state rewarding black women for kicking men out of the house turned black America from functional patriarchy to a dysfunctional matriarchy. Young black guys used to play football because it made their dads proud; now they shoot each other because thugs turn the women on. Yes, matriarchy is much bloodier than patriarchy.After the Revolution, we need to bring back the kind of multitrack schooling they still have in Germany. The stigma around vocational school and the ability to do and build things has to go. The campus lunatics and the wealth extractors driving up tuition costs have almost convinced normal white people that colleges are menticidal concentration camps purpose-built to inculcate white hatred and raze Western civ; now the normies just need a little nudge. Also, the ability to do something—even fix a finicky appliance—instills a pride that comes immediately upon completion of a task. It’s not a fentanyl rush, but it’s a nice buzz and it pays you rather than rotting your arm off or leaving you dead.Then there’s another issue, that has nothing to do with aliens extracting wealth or the diversity polar bear hunting on Friday night: regular old white guys with big guts. Union types, patronage networks, no-show jobs and all kinds of ward-level sleaze and laziness took root and started to fester in Motor City. I forget who said it but they’re right: when you live in a place where it’s winter six months a year, you can’t screw around when building a car. There were all kinds of bad actors but sloth is a sin for a reason, and it’s one a lot of white people have. These days I see the Door Dash guy from Tajikistan in my neighborhood more often than I see the postman in his pith helmet.

            While Japanese cars were starting to creep into the market and there were indeed obese white union hacks at the time, the emergence of Coleman Young as mayor in 1974 was the swift kick to the family jewels that sent Detroit down the tubes. The airport is named after him but the burned out gibs center should be.

                I don’t know about that. What I’ve read about Coleman Young was that he was fairly pragmatic. I think it was more about what was unleashed at the time, which was black self rule while getting back at whitey for whatever perceived injustices at the same time.I completely get some of their anger. One night when Meijers used to be Open 24 Hours, I went in to grab something. I was followed all the way into electronics department buy some black security jerk. I’m a middle-aged white guy. I don’t have the look of somebody who shoplifts. I didn’t like being followed around either. It is extremely insulting.

                    It’s insulting to somebody who demographically is highly unlikely to shoplift. But for negroes, it’s not insult, it’s prudence and the negro should understand that fact. If he’s a lawful negro, he’s got nobody to blame but his fellow negroes.

                        “But for negroes, it’s not insult, it’s prudence and the negro should understand that fact.”
The fact that I have never heard a law-abiding black say, “I understand why storeowners are suspicious of me, given that blacks in general, shoplift more,” shows that race-blind policing feels like oppression to blacks, even the good ones.

                        I think Chris Rock said of Barry: “He smoked crack and got his job back!” There may have been more blacks back then. DC has gentrified quite a bit, not only because it being the home of the Federal teat thus local property developers have the ear of a Congresscritter, but also many workers see the wisdom of not commuting two hours each way, five days a week.)After Barry’s death (?) the city even erected a statue of his own self. Last I checked, substantially all the city’s violent crime is committed by that Certain Demographic. The city is so screwed up that the city government tried to reform the crime code, that vestige of white authority. In a rare fit of common sense, Congress and (I think) the President both vetoed the change. Unlike worse-off cities like Detroit, the Federal control still provides some sanity but the city is amazingly dysfuncional just the same.

            Detroit started getting the “Blessings of Diversity” around the time Henry Ford got River Rouge up and running (Late 19-teens early 1920s). There was an episode of the PBS seriesThe Great DepressiontitledA Job At Ford’sthat interviewed older black workers who worked the line for Ford before and during the Depression. Surprisingly, there were Mexican immigrants who came up to Detroit at the same time too. And when the downturn came, the cry went out “Send ’em back!”Those were an older generation willing to work heads down.During WW2 more and more folks moved up north to Detroit to work in The Arsenal of Democracy resulting in a riot in the city in 1943.Post War more and more started moving up and then came 1967.And then the tensions on the line. I’ve read of racial scuffles between blacks, Arab immigrants, and the older white supervisors at the old Dodge Main plant, and River Rouge for Ford. A younger, more militant generation moved in and did wildcat strikes and toked up as cars rolled down the line.The 1970s came and 1) Increased governmental regulations and 2) better quality cars from Europe and Japan dealt the Big Three some fatal body blows. The old plants shut down and assembly work moved to the South or across the border.The problem is, as I’ve noted before, much of manufacturing has been automated and instead of teams of workers muscling sheetmetal stampings around a body jig and hitting it with their spot welders, robots methodically line the sheetmetal up and put consistent welds on the bodies without a human being involved in any of it. So where do you put the guys who would have done the welding, or moved the punch presses, or done the painting?

                “So where do you put the guys who would have done the welding, or moved the punch presses, or done the painting?”Of course, that is the issue.  The export of manufacturing jobs aside, the country was entering a technological era in which products of the mind were rewarded and manual labor less so.  In the 20’s Detroit began to take off as the car industry boomed.  Farm labor moved from down South to take residence in the North—the great migration.  Things were good—until the next great societal/economic change.Now where do these people go to find good paying jobs?  Good paying meaning employment at some level to provide the promise of the proverbial “American  Dream”.  Capitalists shipped the needed jobs off to foreign lands and gave those people their “American Dream”.   🙂Of course, the problem decried above is much more nuanced and detailed, but  in the main basically described.  Have fun buying your cheap foreign imports at Walmart while fighting your way through the economic detritus that used to be a vibrant city.

            “Most of the untalented 9/10ths of blacks have always been able to do some useful work in the past . . .”It’s the 99 and 9/10ths that is untalented.  And whatever theoretically “useful” work they used to do, they can no longer do so.  Decades of uncontrolled inbreeding plus reversion to the mean have left the average AINO jogger dumber, more impulsive, more violent, and more entitled.“Young black guys used to play football because it made their dads proud . . .”Despite the constantrepetition of this fallacy, the average black family was never the standard White nuclear family.  Johnson’s “Great Society” did not cause the breakdown of something that never existed; it merely exacerbated innate tendencies and trends.  Most black guys never had a father in the home and the idea they could all ‘make good’ by playing football is yet another lie conservatives like to repeat.Multitrack schooling is a terrific idea . . . for White people.  There is no ‘track’ that will ever make blacks suitable for White society.  They were crappy garbagemen and janitors back in the day and no one sane wants any of them ‘trained’ to pretend to work amongst Whites.

                May I add to your astute observation.  We are talking/concentrating waay too much on “Blacks”. The problem to a greater or lesser extent is “diversity”, or basically non-Whites in too great a number for a White community to sustain.  I admit Blacks are an existential threat, but other diversity is soul sucking as well.Other races/cultures simply have different values.  For example, before he died my father-in-law had the pleasure of diversity move in across the street from his home of 30+ years.  The new owner from India.  He didn’t like to maintain the trees and other vegetation that the typical home in the neighborhood sported, so after a few weeks had them all removed so the home resembled a vacant lot with a house.  This diversity representative also seemed to sport a large, extended family, so now the newly cleared area had no less than half a dozen cars parked on it most evenings and weekends.I can go on with “stories”, but the point is made I believe.

                    Compsci: Far too often, now, this comment section devolves into what seems nothing more than a college BS session.  Everyone throwing out this or that idea or theory, as though nothing similar has ever been thought of or tried before.  Then one gets the standard “Well, what would YOU do?  Huh?  How about something constructive?”  Oh, and let’s not forget the “something that can actually be done” in today’s AINO retort, as if anything based on racial reality will ever be done by popular acclaim.None of these ideas will ever be done or work because they all still paper over or ignore basic truth:  Genetics&gt;culture.  Since society will not acknowledge that race is real, nothing substantive will ever be done.  If folks here think that having ‘green zones’ in various cities will make life in a majority non-White AINO tolerable, good luck to them.  If they think school tracking and some sort of soft segregation is the solution, have at it.I have no desire to live in any such society or simulacrum.  And no, I am not willing to ‘compromise’ on having a White society.  With blacks, mestizos, han, etc. – All It Takes Is One.  They all have relatives and friends.  The White soup needs no extra alien seasoning, a la John Derbyshire.  All it took was one black woman to slaughter a 3 year old White child in a majority White area.  All it took was one subcon to reject the social mores of your father’s neighborhood.  I’m not a fan of exceptions or NAXALT arguments, because they still fail to accept and act upon basic biological truth.  Without that biological honesty, it all turns to mental masturbation.

And, to bolster Compsci’s point, it is not just blacks, but other non-whites, too.
Even with Chinese, who can function very well in a technical capacity, they arenotEuropean. And that very fact precludes these people from ever becoming “us”.
To paraphrase J. Enoch Powell, integration implies that you’re for all practical purposes indistinguishable from the hosts. If you can be identified as different, you will be considered as such – and that’s where all problems seem to begin.

                            Enoch was a wise man, and a primeproduct of his race, society, and culture.  For his sake, I hope that those in heaven have neither awareness of nor interest in the doings of men on Earth, because if such a man were to see current reality and the fall of his people, heaven would become a hell.

                            Why not just go with what is statistically defensible — that “good one” is by definition an outlier? And that valid generalizations cannot be drawn from outliers? And, as a consequence of this, whatever cumulative good the rare “good one” may bring by being civil or whatever, they are vastly outweighed by the negative.
Don’t make it any harder than it is.

                            Yep, when the rubber meets the road, no matter how “conservative” or White they sound or act, blacks (in particular) will always be black first and everything else second, third, fourth or worse.  We don’t need any of them.

                        None of these ideas will ever be done or work because they all still paper over or ignore basic truth: Genetics&gt;culture.
This is always just a creedal belief. Same with “reversion to mean”, which is simply a misunderstanding of what being an outlier means.
Yes, I agree if one accepts your creed, @3g4me, the rest follows. Yet that appears not to have been the case when there were different standards, like greater punishment for blacks, as @pyhrrus talked about. They could coexist in separated neighborhoods, or even across the back yard, as was common in the South.

This is intolerable to all blacks, including the good ones.  They all see it as oppression, while we see it as race-blind policing.  It is an unbridgeable divide.
To paraphrase our Silly Citizen on the burdens of living with diversity, “You can hold your arms over your head for long periods of time, but at some point, you wonder why you must do this.”

Crap, used to be men in the country who would do the hard work of making it a better place for their kids. Now we mostly just whine about it being too hard.
Which is why I’m increasingly coming to think of DR as a dead end. There’s no path to even maintaining, let alone winning.

                                    If you genuinely believe there is some modus vivendi, living as a minority with non-Whites, then you are not interested in winning.  Winning, to me, doesn’t mean a miscegenated, diverse, or even segregated society.  And if you are willing to compromise on that before even fighting for something better, then your children and grandchildren will ultimately be a biological dead end.

Let me know when. Until then, I’m going to keep on trying to keep Section 8 out of my community, and get whites started in their own businesses, where they don’t have to report to DIE HR departments. If there were more like me, we might not even need a revolution.
As I say, let me know. I’m not holding my breath. Holding up a chair is too much…

Not like there are that many options but to at least try to keep a white community, right?

So long as I can, I think I’ll keep losing a little bit to be able to sell the Fredrickson kid a place he can afford, and keep it in the community.
But if you are talking about business startups, no regrets at all. If I can help some white kid in the attainment of his ambitions, heck, yes. And, while some will probably object, even white girls.

                                            Steve,Good on you. Remember:nothingis set in stone, even at this point.For every white you can get to start their own business, this is potentially a small win for traditionalism. Doubly so if said white is wise to the evils attendant to Leftist society.You say:If there were more like me, we might not even need a revolution.And that is indeed true. As far as I can glean, the wisest DR folk advocate for building something from the ground up. Recall, it took how long to build the US into the nation it was in the 50s? Time galore.Our future starts with small steps at the bottom, I’m afraid.God bless you.

Sorry Ostei, but I don’t believe that is what Steve is advocating. He seems to believe first in preserving what he can (a good move); and then perhaps moving on from there.
A ground up approach, perhaps?

It is a dead end.  Nothing more than endless talk and philosophy until its time to leave the mortal coil.

                                Exactly. Little known fact: even with segregation, blacks refused to be policed by whites. Blacks were hired to police blacks even when segregation existed. People often are surprised to learn places like Memphis or Atlanta had black cops during segregation. This is why.
Segregation was a half measure in part created to accommodate the business and agricultural interests, which wanted cheap labor. Sound familiar? Capitalism at its finest right there. The answer is something more than segregation.

                            And yet those workable circumstances could not be sustained. And they couldn’t because we wouldn’t, therefore the presence of negroes was a fatal flaw in America. The moment the first African slave debarked in the colonies, future America was doomed.

                                That’s likely all true, @Ostei. There’s a reason many (most?) abolitionists sought to ship them to Africa. And even then didn’t or couldn’t follow through. The vengeful Radical Republicans screwed up their fair share and then some by elevating blacks above Confederates.
But from there it was mostly a holding action, up to and including horsewhips, like @Filthie alludes, and occasional extra-judicial proceedings when the state refused to do its duty.
Right up until the usual suspects cooked up the civil rights movement.

                                The weirdest thing seems to be that, regardless of political affinity, almostevery senior statesmanof the US up to and including Truman realised that blacks were a huge problem in America, and ought not to be there.

                                    Somebody should write a book about why negroes were not repatriated to Africa after the Civil War. If done honestly, it would be a fascinating and valuable volume of history. Of course, it’s entirely possible the book would have to be self published insofar as no publishing house would touch it.

                                        Because the South, where most of them lived, no longer had any political power, and the North wanted to sadistically rub the South’s nose in the shit of free Negroes like a bad puppy.Fun fact: the North never wanted nor loved Negroes, except for a handful abolitionist fanatics like John Brown. The North wanted to free itself from the political influence of the Southern agrarian economy so it could create a capitalist, industrial economy based on “free” white labor (which could in many instances be treated worse the Negro slave labor).Negro slavery simply gave the North the moral outrage to justify killing other white Americans. After the North won the war, it forgot about the Negroes until they once again became a useful political and moral pawn in the 1960s.

                            And why on earth would any rational White want to live like that?  Constantly alert to black predations, spending society’s excess time and money on keeping them moderately behaved and in their place.  What is the ultimate point of raising them from their jungle norm to the status of 3rd class citizen?  How does that benefit White people?

I could be mistaken, but when you talk about your vision of the future, all I hear is rainbows and unicorns.

                                    I take umbrage at that comment – simply because I refuse to accept the status quo does not mean I live in castles in the air.  The question is the survival of the White race and a future for White children.  If that future is going to be one of being a hated and degraded minority, I would rather there be no future at all.  Settling for less has gotten us where we are.  I am definitely a believer in dying on one’s feet rather than living on one’s knees.  But first, at least give one’s all for victory.  Don’t quit or accept helot status and call it ‘winning.’

I’ll take a white community if it’s the best I can get, rather than condemn my kids and future grandkids to fighting a losing shooting war. Which your kids would also assuredly die in, regardless of your good intentions.

                                                    I have never advocated for “sea to shining sea Whiteness.”  AINO is lost to us.  And it was/is legitimately too large, and even if all White too diverse, to function as one single polity.  Yes, I get the idea of subsidiarity and the rest, but human nature being what it is, even without damned Lincoln the idea of 50 states working together in lockstep would have come up, because efficiency, profit, etc.  There need to be individual White communities, with the hope of someday a White homeland.  At present it’s all baby steps – but most people won’t even consider a future outside of the ‘norm.’Again – many, many people tell us how much they would just ‘love’ to moverural as we have . . . but they won’t.  And they will still send their kids to college to be taught to hate themselves and their heritage, because that’s the path to success in AINO today.  My husband and I both have college degrees and lots of impressive credentials that ought to put us squarely in the ‘progressive’ camp, if not at least Conservative, Inc.  But we despise them all, and are hoping to better equip our sons for a future within a fractured and violent world, God help us all.

                                                        There need to be individual White communities, with the hope of someday a White homeland. At present it’s all baby steps – but most people won’t even consider a future outside of the ‘norm.’
That’s exactly what I’m advocating.What are you objecting to in what I’m saying? Are my communication skills that crappy?

Enough acreage for around 100 cow-calf pairs, (though I’m only running just under 80 currently) plus a decent-sized woodlot. But I live within 4 miles of the nearest small town, and am more or less an elder statesman (though not on the council, again, by choice).

Building white community in a place such as that would be borderline suicidal. Doing so out in the territories, however, is a wise act.

                    Around here there are very few actual Blacks. Unfortunately the White political elite is a bunch of shitlibs and they have gleefully admitted every imaginable shade of the diversity rainbow (primarily Pajeets). The most obvious example of the problems this causes is in package delivery. The local package delivery operations, from FedEx all the way down to Jimmy’s Package Disposal company hire nothing but browns from all over the world. Most of them speak very poor English and so trying to give them instructions of any kind is usually a wasted effort.The real problem though is lack of empathy. Basically, they don’t empathize with the mostly White customers and thus don’t give a shit if they leave your package in the proper place just toss it in the dumpster.

            That’s a nice story you’re telling yourself.  The diverse immigrant doing the work Americans won’t supposedly do themselves is a self-serving lie, or least a half truth.  He can afford to work for a lot less than most normal White people. He likely shares an apartment with 3 or 4 other people from his home country.  He either doesn’t have any kids or if he does, they are back home where he sends parts of his pay.  Of course, the Dollars he sends home get converted into Somoni which goes a hell of a lot further in Tajikistan than the equivalent Dollar goes in the US.  His family in Tajikistan can live for a week fairly well for the 10-20% of his pay he sends back home.  He also was not raised in our degenerate culture. He’s not steeped in the culture today.It really pisses me off when people blame the dysfuntional White people for their current condition that we put them in.  We could stop all these drugs in our society if we wanted to.  We sent all of our manufacturing abroad with the imbecilic idea that our factory workers would learn to code or something.  We sold off all the social capital.IMHO, this victim blaming is the just excuse we make to ease our conscious for what we did to them. Instead of accepting responsibility and reversing all the harmful decision, we just blame them for the problem and ignore it. Yes, there is and always will be a dysfunctional portion of the population who will be in the criminal class. But it was much smaller before all this experimentation in post-civilization.  Even the dirty 70s with a massive bulge of Boomer 20 somethings did not have the army of dysfunctional people, homeless people, junkies and criminal class we have today.

                You are probably remembering a different ’70s. In just 18 months in ’71-2, the FBI counted over 2500 bombings. I think it’s largely that the civil rights movement hadn’t completely extinguished freedom of association yet, so thede factosegregation still kept the dysfunctional out of the suburbs.

                    Fuck off with this.Whyare Hispanics like that? Because they will not have the full force of the law up their ass should they take direct action. When the entire law enforcement apparatus of society from local cops all the way up to 3 letter agencies are weaponized against you it isveryunwise to attack their sacred cows. No less than the president himself has declared “white supremacy” the most dangerous terrorist threat we face.White Men have plenty of balls, but they will experience an asymmetric response of such absurd proportion that there is no benefit to taking action unless you wish to be made an example of and lose, at minimum, your livelihood if not your freedom. You speak like someone that just beamed down here from another planet or a Boomer retard living in a 40 year old time bubble, which is it?

                    True, and yet–and this is perhaps the singular defense I can dredge up in defense of the white man–the Messkin doesn’t have to worry about the entire weight of AINO’s power structure falling upon him should he so much as look crosseyed at a nuggra. Being colored, even brown if not black, serves as a shield against official persecution. To be white is to be naked.

                Yes, the problem is that the blacks went somewhere. Unless they killed themselves off. Which they do, but usually so quickly as to explain changing demographics. I’ve already mentioned today that DC gentrified substantially in recent decades, the black fraction of population dropping from a peak of about 70% in the 1970s to 40% or so now. That’s a big drop, and the blacks moved somewhere. Some to the burbs (one more reason I’m thankful that I quit the area two decades past.) Others to shitholes that became worse shitholes such as the conveniently close Baltimore.

            Great comment and I’d add that a black upper-middle class remains in L.A., in the upper Crenshaw/Black Dahlia neighborhoods, with palpable political influence (probably owing to the next doomed local mega-industry, media) despite being numerically irrelevant. The less clever ones, e.g. trucking and oil and breweries and the aerospace trade you reference, were exported to Riverside and Palmdale from way back. Nuevos Americanos have taken over South Central, Compton, Long Beach, etc.

        Apartheid is the only way. It worked in South Africa and it might — just might — work in the USA. As the old saw goes, “you can take the monkey out of the jungle, but you can’t take the jungle out of the monkey.” The civil rights movement was the spark but the kindling was the demographic shift in the population that occurred after WW2 as southern blacks drifted to northern cities and brought their dysfunction with them. Today one can look at cities like Minneapolis and see how far they’ve gone down the Detroit route. The downtown area of Minneapolis increasingly looks like the downtown area of Detroit.

            I like the direction of your thinking. However, respectfully, Apartheid doesn’t go far enough, nor is it going to be any more sustainable. We need separation, not segregation.We need to expand our thinking. State lines are arbitrary lines on a political map. We need Africans (1) in their own polity, responsible for their own political and economic governance. I would be delighted for them to have self-rule, as long as they are neither ruling over us or being used as a weapon against us by Globalist Evil. I recall the porculent Oprah Winfrey recently saying “They want to make us slaves again!” No, you fat black bimbo. No one wants you as a slave. No one wants you as free. No one wants you around at all.Those who have complete self-governance will not be taken seriously screaming “IMPERIALISM” or “RACISM.” After the collapse or dismemberment of the Global American Empire, we need retain neither all the existing states nor their current boundaries. (2) The Africans are already significantly self-segregated, just not along existing state border lines. Draw a reasonable line around it and make that line an international border rather than a boundary between federated states.The Americanized Africans with their European genomic admixture are, in spite of their failings known well to the redpilled, significantly more intelligent than baseline Africans. They ARE capable of building better communities for themselves than what they have now. They are, like us, ruled from Washington DC by white leftist femicommies on behalf of rootless cosmopolitan transnational corporations. I suggest Oprah Winfrey as the first President of Neo-Wakanda. If I live through the war, I’ll volunteer to make the sacrifice of becoming our first ambassador to their new polity.(1) This means the descendants of slaves only. The rest, Somalians, Eritreans and whatnot, should be pitilessly removed from North American along with the other numerous parasitical aliens who have no claim to being in the American story.(2)Our new state boundaries should reflect local EUROPEAN-AMERICAN homogeneity. We need to be a federation of European ethnostates once again.

You don’t know Haiti. Its failure for the last 200 years is blamed to imperialism and racism, even if they have been self-ruled for 2 centuries now.

            I’ve seen de facto apartheid succeed, such as in the town where I grew up, where it persists to this day, successfully. But without the force of law it is fragile, susceptible to many things that can undermine it, as has happened many other places.The important point is that it’s a better deal for everybody. Negros, for the most part, are better off under functioning municipal apartheid regimes than they are in places where they’ve gained “control.” The proof of that is overwhelming and everywhere. The Kim Gardners and Lori Lightfoots are about the only ones who benefit from black power, the great mass of negros do not. Of course your typical negro is too dumb to understand this, you are lucky if he can even spell apartide, so we are unlikely to arrive at it by persuasion. And that’s before you get into the difficulty of persuading our fellow whites.

                Blacks can’t govern themselves, period. A short flight to Port-au-Prince should convince anyone of that. And in today’s world they’ve just become an annoyance, a source of constant trouble. The ideas and outlooks of the pre-WW2 people were correct but are verboten today, what with the chosen ones dictating what is double plus good and what is thoughtcrime.

                    It’s not simply Blacks that can’t govern themselves.  As I’ve noted, I live in a majority Hispanic community.  The dysfunction here is only different in the existential/violent nature of it, but not in basic decline.  Hispanics have risen to political prominence and the County/city have fallen into chaos.  Where there once was a thriving and growing city is now a declining/deteriorating reminder of what once was.
So would I trade Detroit for it, of course not, but that’s not to say it’s desirable.

                            Yep.  The Tucson sector of the Border Patrol is about 50% or a bit more *Hispanic*.  They talk about illegals constantly and from all appearances are damn serious in their job of keeping them *out*!  It makes sense.  Illegals affect the poorest of any society they infiltrate.  Those Hispanics who have successfully migrated have everything to lose by more.  Of course, the race hucksters who sway them politically have everything to gain by more illegals.

                It’s not that they’re too dumb. Of course they are but it’s irrelevant. Blacks, like almost all non-white people—maybeall peopleexcept Nordic/Germanic and Japanese people—admire and desire corruption.
They want their leaders to steal and get away with it. They want whistleblowers, dissenters, and reformists—losers—punished. They’ll give up everything just to see, just once in their lives, one of “theirs” drive by in a gold-plated Maybach.
By the standards of, say, Richard Spencer, they’re the Real Right, and we who object to it are a spiteful rabble unfit for self-government.

                    Correct, once blacks get into power you start seeing this conspicuous consumption emerge practically immediately. The scale of it varies depending on the position (from the ruler of an postcolonial African state to Fani Willis) but the pattern is clear. Also, this behavior leaves a paper trail a mile long, which means that once they fall afoul of the regime they are easy to pick off, but that is, from the regime POV, a feature and not a bug.Like, there is this idiotic pastor in Brooklyn who was known for exactly this corruption, he just got sentenced to 9 years in jail, yet despite the fact that obviously a pastor should not be earning enough to wear Louis Vuitton suits daily, “his people” kept coming to the church and giving him money. And oh yea, he is friends with the mayor of NYC, so you know that guy is compromised.

            After WWII, neither blacks nor whites foresaw that the Supreme Court would overthrow the existing order and the right to freedom of association that had worked so well, with segregated but often quite good schools, and tough policing and sentencing for black criminals…Which order was supported by most of the highly religious black community…Then radical blacks and jews began a long campaign to give black criminals special rights, while at the same time the CIA was funding its illegal efforts in SE Asia by importing masses of drugs into America, and specifically into the black community…Drug gangs formed, and eventually controlled much of the city of Chicago..The white population left en masse, and the cops were stood down by Democrat politicians…Voila…current American cities, unfit for habitation..

        It is encouraging to see Jim Crow laws slowly being restored as well as racial sanity. The negro is incapable of civilization regardless of jewish attempts to weaponize the negro against whites.
White Christians should start helping predominately jewish neighborhoods in upstate New York become more diverse through forced integration and racial quotas in schools. Goose meets gander.

        Richard Florida was famous for “Regeneration” projects. He ultimately decided it doesn’t work; there’s only so many artists, writers, bohemians to go around.

Cities need strong leaders for generations to create; they can be destroyed in under a decade with bad ones.I’ve lived long enough, traveled extensively, lived in many places. These projects rise and fall under their own economic contradictions. You can’t have a “cherry on top” place in every major city while the vast majority of the poplulation can’t afford housing, decent roads, and physical safety.

        Detroit was one of the rust-belt cities that were subject tobloc-busting. At one time, decades ago, there was more of a visible religious presence, predominantly Catholic but with other denominations as well. That attracted the attention of some self-appointeddo-gooderslike Lutheran Family Services. Encourage Mississippi Delta-to-Northern City migration, and funnel that into those strongholds. Don’t be surprised when those communities atomize and flee to suburbs.EMJ had a good take on that ages ago, and not much has changed. People still feel compelled to subject others to their whims, and now get federal subsidies to assist in the ripping of social fabric.

            Block busting was the tool used to destroy Baltimore. A certain type would buy a house in a white working class area then rent it to blacks. Then they would have agents knocking on doors offering a quick sale. It only took a few takers before the area was all for sale signs. It was primarily a money grab, but the money scheme attracted a predictable type.

                    I’ve mentioned this before, but a few months after a Hutu pack moved into the rental across the street from us in 2009, we put our house up for sale. And some Messkins living next door to the Hutus did the same.
As a pleasant aside, we moved into a much nicer and negro-free neighborhood right before housing prices shot through the roof–so to speak. The value of our house has more than doubled in 13 years.

                        The value of our house has more than doubled in 13 years.
Less inflation means… voof. I feel your pain, bro. 😉

                    We moved to Cleveland Hts OH (East Side) in late 70s. Nicer neighborhood but there had been block-busting going on in the small-house areas bordering East CLE, where blacks were moving up the hill from the city, some with children living with “relatives,” which allowed them to attend the once-excellent public schools. At one point the city (CLE Hts) along with Shaker Hts made it illegal to place real estate For-Sale signs in peoples’ yards. This was to forestall block busting. It was also the era that destroyed the City of CLE public schools with US Judge Battisti’s forced bussing. East Side black kids sent to West Side white ethnic schools. Quite literally the lower middle class whites moved out of the city. It was expensive, but we sent our kids to private schools. Did the same when we moved to NJ a couple of yrs later. Same issues in suburbs outside Newark.

                Not sure if that happened in St. Louis or not but the white-flight was strong there too, starting in the fifties. St. Louis used to be so large that it had TWO baseball teams (the Browns left for Baltimore in 1953). And it has (had) beautiful brick and stone houses all over north St. Louis, with cool design flourishes and little Germanic turrets and so forth. Most are completely dilapidated now.Growing up all the white grandparents I knew spoke of their days in Normandy and Goodfellow, which was a bit jarring because the “city kids” now all lived there, bussed in to my school back when there was still desegregation.

                    St Louis is a sad example of the demographic destruction.  As a person from the SW USA I used to enjoy STL since it had an eastern feel to it and the brick houses were very cool.  Windy road and a lot of trees.  The people even had an eastern accent.  The nasty stuff was across the river in East STL.    The bad stuff is now all over the core of the metro area with whites moving farther and farther west.

                    Newark New Jersey was an almost all-white city in 1950. Southern blacks started showing up in numbers while interstate highways were being built.  Whites got on those highways and left.  After the 67 riots, the remaining whites got out.

                There’s a reason for the saying, “There goes the neighborhood”, whenever a black family moved into a hitherto lily-white neighborhood. It was invariably the beginning of a snowballing process that would initially start with astute whites seeing the writing on the wall and surreptitiously selling, and this would eventually become a rout.

                            Lineman:  Conservative, middle class Whites have been utterly pacified.  They believe in always following the rules, sticking with the existing structure, everything within permitted limits.  To be a legitimate White advocate these days, one must have a revolutionary mindset.  Most Whites are terrified by that – and they’ve been told by their zionist churches that a good Christian always obeys earthly authorities.

                            Being on the leading edge of trying to keep my community in the community, our principal problem is outbidding the Progs’ idealism. They really, really think converting their rambler to Section 8 is worth taking &gt;10% less on sale price.
White communities are not like the Orthodox community Jared talked about. Our defectors care nothing at all for whatever happens after they move out.

                Yeah my mom told me about the block busting that went on in D.C. in the depression era. And the blacks they moved in were less than the neighborly type, they made sure their presence was well known, like having a woman go outside wailing “aaaaahhhhh….aaaahhhhhh” all night long.

                The one neighborhood I saw resist that was one that border part of Grosse Pointe Park.  Basically filled with Kentucky hillbillies that moved there during the war.  Maybe a few thousand.  They resisted and likely by “irregular” means.  I know blacks did not enter.  GGP had a canal from Lake St. Clair part of the Detroit border and the town simply got an engineer to condemn all the bridges and then blocked them, creating their own Maginot line.

                    That’s a great story! I went to Grosse Pte several times in the 90s to participate in flower shows, of all things. I stayed with a nice family in a posh area and marveled at how they were surrounded by the less-pleasant and more dangerous areas of Detroit. But Lake St Clair was at their back so it offered a sense of security, I think. Public schools are still good there, what I here. Anyway, the last flower show I was scheduled to judge at their War Memorial (I think that where it was) had me driving through Detroit, late afternoon hours after the LA jury acquitted OJ Simpson of murdering his wife and Ron Goldman. As I drove up the interstate, getting ready to get off at the one (safe) Grosse Pte exit, I passed under numerous bridges where lots of “youths” were running and jumping with excitement. I was praying that no one would get the wild idea to pitch a trash can over the bridge railing in celebration of the court’s ruling as I drove underneath!

            I still have a hard time wrapping my head around that theory. Historical animus aside, “Here’s the plan: we’re going to bring in cheap Catholic labor to build industry, let them take over our cities, then we’re going to smash Catholic power and destroy our cities by bringing blacks up from the South, and we’ll ship industry overseas and rule over a third world shithole!” I mean, it sounds like a plan for Protestant suicide to me, and it’s worked out that way for sure.Maybe I’m wrong, and again historical animus aside, and even taking into account the peculiarities of Anglosphere elites, I have to think there’s something else going on.

                    Strange thing is, he isn’t, at least wrt the great migration. Otoh, he has this idea of Catholicism as a race-mixing thing. Idk.
I can even get where he blames Protestants, but then I can point out that Catholic charities are trafficking people today. I’m wondering when Christians generally became subversive weirdos. Which is why I’m convinced something else is going on.

                                    Wish that was all it was. The mainstream denominations are all corrupt, being man-made institutions, but some are vastly worse than others. (Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, megachurches, I’m looking at you!)
Some try to hold the line, but fail, and curiously, they are the ones who get most of the grief. (S. Baptist) No, I’m not S Bap, but it’s closer to what He preached than anything else.

                The old money Puritans saw themselves losing out to German and Scotch-Irish industrialists, so they combined with another set of ethnics to destroy industry through financialization. In the end, it was a suicide, albeit a slow one.

            Steve Sailer has a good rundown about the “Black a Block” program in a Chicago suburb.  A little works, but too much seasoning ruins the stew.
The south has a term for neighborhood demographic shifts:
“The neighborhood is going dark”.
The book “Left Behind in Rosedale” is a great book on the topic.

        Really sharp analysis, thanks. My money is on Detroit’s reversion to the mean like Baltimore but hope springs eternal. I would note Detroit continues to have incredibly wealthy patrons and Baltimore mostly does not, so the possibility cannot be foreclosed entirely.One can guess as to who they select for this special form of inspection.Given what happened with TSA, I have to assume they select white people.As for the “Fortress Cities,” these are just a new version of “better schools,” but instead of white shitlibs, it is Normie Cons this time, hence the rage. I noticed the Mail got the name of Buckhead wrong and called it “Buckhaven.” Still, what Kemp and the good Christian, pro-lawwwwfffff conservatard Republicans did to throttle that desperate attempt to escape was just another reminder that the only thing to expect from the GOP is betrayal, cowardice and corruption. It is good to see other areas were able to overcome the communist overlords and their Republican whores, though.

        Many local politicians were arrested so they could not interfere in the repair efforts.
One of them, Kwame Kilpatrick [sic;not bothering to check] was Pepe-marched front and center last weekend by the Trump Team after he endorsed Don-Don in Detroit.
Trump commuted the guy’s sentence, and the Trump Beach Blanket Blonde Bimbo PR team rolls out a murderer to show how blacks and whites,together, are going to, like, Make America Great Again.

        Let’s call “civil rights” for what it is: Negro privileges. The social capital you mention can’t survive the blacks’ bad behavior protected by their special status. In fairness, any group would act out once their more impressionable members sensed their special privilege, maybe not as much as negroes, but to some extent the same thing would happen. By the way, the econometricians are often puzzled by the loss of productivity in our economy over the last fifty or so decades. But the puzzle is solved when one realizes that this secular slowdown has coincided quite neatly with the destruction of social capital over those same decades.

        I live in Los Angeles in the 90s when Mayor Richard Reardon and Governor Pete Wilson righted the ship temporarily.  They did all the right things, policed in a way to keep the white neighborhoods safe, and keep the city functioning.
Didn’t matter in the long run.  Only takes one or two election cycles for all progress to be destroyed.

            Re: St. LouisSt. Louis County has a million people, two-thirds of whom are white. Within the St. Louis city limits, whites are less than half the population, the same with blacks. The city’s white population actually is slightly increasing and the black population is decreasing and being pushed back into the hood and into dysfunctional suburban towns. Remember Ferguson? it is now north of seventy percent black and is the equivalent of a Muslim-dominatedbanlieue outside Paris. There are other ramshackle “cities” in St. Louis County exactly like it. The fasting growing ethnic population in both the city and the county is Hispanic, I think.That’s the trajectory of America.

        I have never been to Detroit, but Greek Town sounds exactly like the sort of economic zones you see in hundreds of cities these days. The same mix of multicultural restaurants (often with a “James Beard-winning chef”), the same craft breweries and wine bars, the same semi-grungry warehouses they cleaned up to host concerts, the same tattoo shops, etc. They’re all over the place. They’re also fun in a vacuum but it’s not a genuine culture. I guess it’s just enough for the local populace to keep working for the corporations nearby, but in the end leaves them atomized and individualized because it’s not enough to foster a genuine connection and community, and most of these people don’t go to church or do anything civic.

        Unfortunately, these efforts to stabilize and revitalize small parts of once great cities is nothing more than rearguard action. Sure, not all blacks are criminally inclined, violent and/or otherwise worthless pieces of crap, but WAY too large a percentage are.  That means to have any success at all in saving what’s left of this country, they have to go – walled off somewhere on the continent where they can build a real wakanda and deal with their many disfunctions as they will.  Oh, and every asswipe libs*** will be joining them.

                Yea that would be lovely but you wouldn’t have enough of a White population to rebuild after the fighting was over and I’m not a big proponent of suicide missions…Best we can hope for is ethnostates within this continent and it’s seems like a longshot these days because of apathy, cowardliness, and selfishness of the White population here in AINO…

Perhaps. We shall see. But I believe that some time around 2028, we are going to see mass deportations, no questions asked. Things are changing.

        What city is America does this NOT describe?-feral, violent “diverse” no-go zone-carefully guarded entertainment area for suburban white with money-downtown area where suburban whites and relatively tame vibrants interact for corporate and government servicesThe real issue now is low-birthrate whites getting squeezed out of first-ring suburbs by blacks and immigrants.I live in a lily-white, small-town exurb that voted Trump 65-35. Almost never go to the city for anything, I head further out to the farming communities whenever I can.Was looking for something at Walmart and had to go to the first-ring suburban store right next to the city, but still only 20 miles from my ‘burg.Ho-lee-fook.

That pretty much sums up my area now.  It was 90% White when I moved, but now it’s probably 50% at best.  None of the school children are White either.  Lots of pajeets, ferals and some sort of weird brown mixture type.

                The whites in my town are, shall we say, “prepared” for that quite well. Three gun clubs, lots for deer hunters and 4×4 trucks. Mostly Fudds to be sure but nonetheless well-stocked and generally have a realistic and dim view of the urban demographic.

        If we ever recover from mass psychosis, one day there will be some excellent books written on the topic of self delusion on a grand civilizational scale.  Everyone just pretends that life has vastly improved for everyone since the civil rights era (which is itself a giant lie).Detroit was once known as the Paris of the West.  Diversity turned it into the Lagos of the West.  Something important that everyone just forgets or never knew is that Detroit was destroyed by the children of the generation that moved up from the South to work in the factories while all the white guys were off fighting WW2.  They did not grow up in poverty. They mostly did not grow up fatherless. They did not grow up in the extreme dysfunction of the hood.  They simply reverted to the mean.

                IDK, but it is probably further from the mean than Detroit was.  A lot of these people in Detroit were working in the factories and supporting jobs in suppliers and supermarkets and barber shops etc and were working class people even if they were better paid than the working class in other areas and had the motivation to move to Detroit from the South.Whereas I believe Prince George county is a higher class and so the mean is further away, so it will take a couple generations to revert.  OTOH, sometimes outliers have outlier children.  If they insulate themselves enough, they could be a whole new group.  But this is way outside of my pay grade.

                PG County, when I was growing up nearby in the ’60s and ’70s, was a more blue-collar, not quite so wealthy White county in Maryland.  Then a trickle of blacks from DC began to move in – the magic 1/10 %.  And, as I have repeatedly asserted, all it takes is ONE.  The place is now a standard black sh*thole.  They all work for de gubmint and steal things blind.  The entire black ‘middle class’ in AINO is that same fallacy   – give them a job they don’t deserve nor qualify for, move them to magic dirt next to some White people, and voila!  Magic negroes.  Too many Whites still believe this and will die proclaiming it.

        This kind of arrangement the the default existence in the 3rd world. Little islands of prosperity surrounded by peasants.It’s actually similar to feudal Europe, but the biggest difference is this time the peasants aren’t really contributing anything to the “lords” via grain taxes. Instead the stagnant lords use their position to steal from the ever shrinking worker class and then redirect it to the ever growing peasant class. The peasants contribute votes, while also creating a threatening environment to the workers to keep them motivated to continue producing.A weird arrangement, I don’t know if this has historical precedence. The Roman’s had the grain dole, but that was just contributions from their empire.

        I lived for years in the ATL metro area in one of the endless suburbs that surround the Perimeter (a circular interstate highway bypass that is often more congested than the interstates through town).It was close to my work in the aerospace field and my wife also had a relatively short commute as neither of us were forced to deal with going downtown, which is overrun with black criminality, pesty homeless (called by former talk show host Neal Boortz “urban outdoorsmen”) and now, protests over the treatment of the oh-so-precious blacks and Palestine and whatever reason the kooks give to make the lives of normies into a hellscape.Then we started getting a few Indians moving into our neighborhood. Then a few upper-class blacks. That was bad. Then there were a few carjackings a few miles from where my children go to school and my wife’s work.Years ago, my wife and I bought some property two hours north in the Blue Ridge Mountains, tucked into a valley with one way in and one way out. We continued to buy up acreage to add to our property as our finances allowed and built a nice little cabin as a mountain retreat.Then my wife was accosted at a shopping center in daylight by a couple of “teens” intent on robbing her armed with knives. She was thankfully saved by her concealed carry pistol. They ran off and likely none of them were older than 13.That was the kick over the cliff. We bought some more acreage and started design and construction of our house up there. We sold our suburban house when our new home neared completion and moved up here. She got a new job with the county here and I now have a two-hour commute to work, either at our Georgia site or in a neighboring state.But I don’t mind it since I go to the office four days per week, sometimes less if I’m working from home. There is NO diversity here. You go to the nearby town and all of the restaurants, even the fast food ones, are staffed with friendly white kids who get your order right, minus the attitude from the diverse crowd.We hardly go to ATL any more. I don’t watch sportsball any more and there is a real community here where people are friendly. I go to a barbershop and they know my name, how I want my haircut and I catch up on the local gossip. My younger kids have been a boon to the local high school, both academically and athletically.We grow a lot of our own food here, both in our outdoor garden and in our greenhouse. We have a very nice well with some of the cleanest, best-tasting water you’ve ever had. We have solar panels and some hydroelectric thanks to our stream nearby where I’ve rigged up a small turbine to generate a few kilowatts. In the fall, the mountains are ablaze with orange, yellow and reds that look like a Bob Ross painting. In winter, the snow is gorgeous. The summers are about 10 degrees cooler up here compared to our old suburb.I was lucky in that God blessed my family with the ability to leave the civilization-destroying diversity behind for a mountain retreat. My heart breaks for those who can’t do so.

                    It doesn’t take independently wealthy. Hell, I’m not near as comfortable as I need to be. But to get a guy set up in a siding company takes around a grand. A couple grand to set up someone in welding. A bit more to get into powder coating. $4-5k for being a wedding DJ, if you can buy on sale.
And mostly, those people can afford to pay those debts off within a year or two, plus maintain a standard of living that can support a small family. And that means you can get more people started.

                        A 25-year-old man of my acquaintance went to lineman school after high school. Dude makes serious bank, has a beautiful girlfriend, owns a hunting property and a sweet 2200 sq ft timber-built house with a pole barn that stores all his “toys” – snowmobile, fully-equipped wood shop, bush-hog, Bighorn Explorer, portable hunting blinds, camping, archery and fishing gear, etc.True, in a busy week (in winter, generally), yeah, he may have to work 90+ hours, which sucks (driving the company truck and grossing $5000+ and all), but still… not so bad for a stupid white boy from New York’s north country, who has never even heard of, let alone read, Fanon, or Sartre, or Foucault.Oh, this redneck has a giant TRUMP 2024 banner in his front lawn, which he told me was meant to piss off his sh*tlib neighbor across the road.We will need linemen far into the future, and it shall be sh*tlords like this cocky young man who will be racking up the cash to ensure that Trigglypuff and her cohort can stay online to preach the destruction of our society.

        Denver has gone like Baltimore although its diversity is mainly brown.  They did turn it around for a bit in the 90s through the 00s by revamping the downtown with sportsball.  It started to show signs of reverting to the jungle in the teens, but covid became its death knell.  They took the Seattle/ San Francisco approach by importing the drug/psych/ perversion demographic which I find more pathetic than our dusky brethren.  If there’s no sportball game, nobody goes downtown.

            I forgot to mention that the blame lands on the republican governor who in the 90s did everything he could to attract big tech, which pulled in gobs of folks from the bay area, which forever changed the voter base.   The Californication thing.

        Maintaining the conceit of the civil rights revolution is a luxury borne of prolonged affluence and abundance. Post WW2, the USA was the economic king of the hill and swamped with industrial capital that elevated living standards across the board. By the 60s, politicians learned that this largesse could be used to buy votes and blacks were easy targets because the cost per vote was lowest. That bribery turned them into indentured servants. Then along came LBJ and his welfare handcuffs. Black fathers were driven from the family unit and replaced by Uncle Sam; and from that time forward, black voters became modern slaves to the Borg. And the reason they stay there is low IQ.The fix for this lies in the elimination of the Borg.

            Right. Don’t confuse the symptom with the disease. Blacks were really not (much) of a problem between 1865-1965. Focus on what changed, who changed it, and why.

            How about both…The only reason why there was black fathers in the home(which who really knows if that is truth) was because of Whites enforcing a standard upon them which why is that our beast of burden to bear…We can see what the negro does in Africa without any White control and it doesn’t show us a lot of black fathers in the home…

                Absolutely. What Africa also doesn’t show much of is random violence for random violence’s sake.
There may well be “epigenetic” forces at work, sure, but simple genetics is not enough. American nogs seem to be a distinctly violent subculture. Which suggests there’s a substantial environmental factor unaccounted for. Which is what @TomA and @Tarl are talking about, I think.

                        South Chicago? Hell, yes. It’s only when you start diluting the numbers down with whites and Asians (and to a lesser extent, hispanics) that American cities start looking like places one might choose to start a family.
Root out the diversity, and our non-hispanic white population is more peaceful than European whites.

        Did a tour of duty there in the mid-80s and lived up in GP and rowed out of Belle Isle.  So took the E. Jefferson tour at 0430 each morning for practice.  Detroit’s problem is the neighborhoods were organized around the old “vertical” car plants.  Once those moved to the horizontal design, like GM Poletown all the employed labor vanished with it.  Black and white.  That quickly left the people that could/would not escape as the largest population cohort. So a quick downhill run.  Add in Coleman Young, the greatest of the black urban kleptocrats.  If you remember the “Gran Torino” “spooks” scene.  Used to drive by there every morning to make the turn on Belle Isle Bridge approach–it was frozen in time from 1968 when that whole stretch was abandoned after riots. So many homes were gone empty lots repopulated with pheasants.  And this was 1985.  Good tutorial in how bad it can get and how long that can persist.  Also only place I ever had to point a gun at someone.

        Z, can we have an article at some point soon discussing the situation in France? Even some establishment types over there have been predicting civil war for some time (something admitted almost universally by said types in private – see Eric Zemmour’s writings), and after Le Pen’s strong showing in the European elections and Macron’s gamble on a snap general election, maybe it’s time to revisit? I would love to see your thoughts, as well as those of our worthy commenters.
Thank you in advance.

        Detroit could be unique among cities in this regard. We may not see this “success” replicated. It hit rock bottom, so the locals turned to the Oligarchs to fix things without the usual squawking. Plus there was a core group of local Oligarchs – Ford family, Gilbert, Ilitch family – willing to step up. Moreover, the problem was of sufficiently small scale that it could be addressed with concerted effort. This recipe was special I think.Meanwhile, white Detroit had simply moved to the suburbs but was generally supportive of the effort for sentimental reasons. Would we see this in Baltimore, St Louis or Chicago? Baltimore’s oligarchs are mainly in finance and many have left town. The Busch family has disappeared from politics. Ken Griffin left Chicago and the other oligarchs are either ignored or are complicit (Pritzkers).

            Gilbert saw an opportunity to make a lot of money.  He moved his companies into vacant buildings and pays himself rent.  Thus the buildings now have value.  Ford got a billion $ tax deferral to do the train station.  The Illitches do nothing but hold property.  They mademany promises but have never made good on any of them.

                True, @MOW, but Griffin was a “manage the decline” kind of guy. Rabine had potential, I think, and maybe that .mil chick, (I forget her name, as did pretty much everyone in Illinois.)
You do realize Griffin made his fortune essentially past posting, right? Front-running HFTs because of where he placed his antennae? The only reason he got away with it was that the people front-running were legally distinct from the ones posting, right?

        Step one was to elect a white mayor albeit a Democrat. The long awaited Gordie Howe bridge to Canada is close to completion so you know this second bridge is important to future commerce and trade/imports. (How did We based whites get to name the bridge?)
Even the historic Michigan Central Train station has been resurrected by Ford after rotting away for decades. Formal glory will never return but important billionaires and 3 million plus surrounding white counties may keep it from the dysgenic path Detroit was on. Still, know your surroundings when entering.

            I was mulling over the idea that the border crossing may be the differentiator that might make a difference to Detroit.  Letting other central cities turn into wastelands does not have much impact in the end, but making traversing that border connector too dangerous to attempt would be noticed.

        We lack the will to resurrect the ACS – which is really the only effective solution. There is the underclass and then there is the middle class which simply will not exist without dispossession via racial wealth transfer.Soon we lack the numbers.The biggest issue we face is cultural and identity via cultural transmission. The cultural transmission mechanism elevates and eradicates our identity. What are you doing to resurrect and transmit our culture and identity and inspire those you transmit it to, to adopt, foster and develop it?A white fortress that does not imprint its culture on its people and watches sportsball, Disney and consumes hip-hop and all the rest admits Trojan horse after Trojan horse.In other words, the fortress that isn’t a cultural fortress is just another project that is doomed before it ever starts.

        Detroit isn’t holding the line against nature.
The burned-out areas are being reforested and you can shoot deer in certain zipcodes.
Or at least shootatdeer, if we’re talking about the natives.
The current batch of fatherless city fathers would do well to bring in T. Murdoch as tyrant for a couple of decades.

                We had a .22 shooting range behind my elementary school tail end of the 1970’s. I fired my first shot there when I was eight or so. Nobody got winged or otherwise harmed. 100% white, dutch and german mostly, kids except for a few small hats whose mothers invariably refused to allow their kids to shoot. We were raised to be competitive at everything, the older, bigger kids displayed no mercy, and so we took our instruction seriously. Fun days.

At least if you white-hold a glock switch handgun, the rounds go into the air above where you were aiming. If you ghetto-hold in your left hand, you hit shit to the right of where you were aiming and vice versa.

        Places like Greek Town can survive only so long as the oligarchs–Roger Penske is another–maintain an interest in them and continue investing capital. I suspect the oligarchs will grow bored with their artificial creations, cut off the lucre spigot, and turn their attentions to other more exciting projects. Then Greek Town will become Hutu Town, just like the rest of Detroit, and every sign of civilization will vanish.

        I wonder if we stray into the weeds of defeatism, fellas. Taking race out of it (for the moment)…This problem is not insurmountable. All we have here is rampant criminality. Whites and jews are actively involved, albeit in far fewer numbers.Consider: in the world’s second largest economy (China) – they publicly arrest, prosecute and execute corrupt officials on the take. Granted… a few political enemies of the regime make periodic appearances at the firing squads but that is how the clippers roll.The world’s third largest economy – Russia – was an economic mess ten years ago. They did the same thing as China, and just for good measure they kicked the jews out of their  financial affairs and management. This, despite a costly war raging in Ukraine that they are almost guaranteed to win.Ditto for emerging countries in the second world. The Argies fired their entire managerial class en masse. Sparks of prosperity are smoldering already. Rodrigo Duterte was having crippling problems with drugs and gangs in the Phillipines. He sent out death squads to deal with them Problems with druggies started drying up almost immediately. In El Salvador the gangsters were all taken prisoner and are actually being punished. The benefits were almost immediate.None of these countries are Utopias… but they are slowly climbing out of the holes that they dug for themselves. Brazilification, a majority/minority future need not be our destiny. This crap stops when we put a stop to it. Eventually things will get so bad that we have to and will have no choice. Gangsters can be tried and executed or imprisoned. Human trash can be rounded up and shipped back to their countries. Or they can be beaten into submission as our ancestors did.Could we be making this problem bigger in our minds than it actually is?

            @Filthie,I love ya, but I can’t agree.  I do think it is insurmountable.  First off, in order to have any chance of challenging the moral authority, you have to have some sort of force behind it.  Whites have been deracinated to the point where they have zero power.  Even if you could garner some support for our cause (like the folks here), the average White person would gladly hand over their first born child to a feral negro so long as he doesn’t call them a racist.  I think we are past the point of no return here.  The only thing one can hope for is for everything to come down and something new arises from the ashes.  There are no guarantees that the new thing will be better for White people, and there is no guarantee that it will happen at all.Ask yourself this – has a nation ever replaced its native population and then reversed that replacement?  You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube.

            I share your optimism, @Filthie. It’s not just half the whites who think crime is a bad thing. Blacks don’t like crime, though they sing a different tune when it’s dey gud boi what didn’t done it.
It can be done at the local level (not with the horsewhips, no), though you have to be careful to keep it quiet. If things get bad enough, some states will come on board. No path for the Feds.
Until the Prog run cities burn, I see no way to convince shitlibs they should think crime is bad, too.

        Dan gilbert is no white knight . he moved rock mortgage from a suburb into the city of detroit where all his employees would then have to pay detroit city income taxes. the city condems huge swaths of land an gives it to him for a dollar complete with long term tax abatements. he put up appartments, grocery stor and a few other stores for his employees who lived out to far to commute into detroit after they moved, but the rent is high. like the old coal mining companies, with the company town and company store. all that is left for him to completely capture them if for rock to start paying them in shopping credits good only at his stores and for their rent.

        Apartheid and/or complete separation sound like admirable goals from a DR perspective. But then you had that black city councilman from Jackson, Miss. who said [paraphrasing] “when they [the police] come in here from outside the city chasing our people, you throw rocks, breecks, bottles, whatever you can find and show them, stay out.” So self-rule, that is,  separation, is out in my book, because no matter how large the area, there will always be a border. And to have them daily invading white spaces en masse [apartheid] from just beyond the perimeter, should be out too imo.One might think, well the devil is in the details. Some solution, a new stasis, can surely be found to the present disorders and contradictions of the present system. Again, just my opinion, but a total overthrow of the current DEI culture is the only solution, not walls or borders, which are insufficient. Make it extremely inhospitable for them to be around us and things will take care of themselves. That isn’t in the cards for now, but I have a sneaking suspicion that someday, it will be.

        While in Army basic training at Ft. Knox in 1969 I noticed that half of the guys there were Whites from Michigan. They told stories of the MC5 and the concert scene up there.They were like tough, not-so-peaceful hippies. The few that I kept up with all moved to Texas after the Army.

        I think there’s an argument that Detroit is more strategically important than Baltimore, mainly because there are multiple ports on the Eastern seaboard.
The other advantage Detroit has (had?) is the presence of Windsor, which permitted convenient access to a skilled White labor force at somewhat lower rates thanks to the weaker CAD.

            Detroit is situated close to the sources of minerals including taconite and copper as well as the plants and mills for exploiting .them Very cheap transpo via the interlake system and rail connects with Gary, Chicago and Cleveland and Lima OH. Not convinced Allentown-Pittsburgh to Baltimore had quite as many advantages. Both regions have good technical universities and willing blue collars.

        everything can be fixed in america if liberal values die off.(maybe except for california)
problem is establishment’s plan ain’t about that, their plan is to tweak the melting pot idea by injecting some MAGA concepts into it.
kinda like what stalin did during world war 2, in order to defeat nazis he allowed some minor russian ethnic nationalism to manifest, he sprinkled some of it on the demonic j-ish bolshevik construct(which ultimately led to Putin becoming president, but it took 60 years to get there).

            California is turning into a de facto two-tier racially based state. Upper tier: rich White, Middle Eastern, Asian, Jewish + a smattering of the smartest HIspanics. Lower tier: Mexican, Mexican, Mexican. No blacks – all pushed out to Third World settlements like Victorville or beyond. It’s a Latin American model similar to what you would see in a place like São Paulo.

Baltimore and Detroit need more Mexicans.The cities are now an anachronism that grew in the 19th century because of Steam powered machines and have been artificially kept alive since the creation of widespread electricity and transportation, the internal combustion engine.   Legacy systems of government and politics, real estate and status along with the office cubicles counterrevolution to computers kept them alive a century past their justification for any economic reason.The only justification now is government, with the Green and COVID agendas driving cubicle workers to remote work and fuel prices keeping them there… is why the borders are open.  The migrants from all over the world are coming for NY States $10,000 ATM card and to live in Hotels.No one would want to raise a child in any city if they can avoid it, they can.Let the cities dwindle into Venues or ruins, let the savages perish with them.  There’s no case beyond our mortal enemies in the System persistence in office?Bantu are not mortal foes just feral children, manageable.If the Fords and others want to be sentimental, that’s their money.The only case for Detroit or Baltimore is as port.  That’s it.   The rest was destroyed 50 years ago.   Move on.

            “Let the cities dwindle into Venues or ruins, let the savages perish with them.” “Baltimore and Detroit need more Mexicans.”They’re our cities, built by our people for our people. We’ve surrendered too much ground already, and welcoming more Mexicans is pure insanity. They still consume more than they produce, leaving Whites to supplement the costs of their food, housing, and health care. Plus, they’re not us. A better policy would be to stop supplementing failure and feral breeding of all non-heritage Americans.And the savages don’t perish. Like locusts, they destroy one area and move onto the next, helped along by elites who will never suffer the joys of diversity themselves.

        St. Louis continues to sport the highest murder rate in the country at 66 per 100,000 …St. Louis punches way way above its weight though due to a statistical quirk.  The city of St. Louis itself is legal entity that is distinct from the surrounding county, so the murder rate is for the burned-out urban core of the city alone.  The surrounding “white flight” suburbs are not included in the calculation of crime rates at all.  For other cities like – I assume – Baltimore, at least some of the surrounding suburbs are probably included in the calculation of the overall crime rates and that will tend to lower them.  I suspect that in fact Baltimore is the reigning champ for murder and Detroit a close second.  If the rate was calculated for St. Louis like it is for every other city, I think they’d actually fall pretty far down the list.  I’d bet my current stomping grounds of Philadelphia would even come in a clear winner over them.

                None of what has been floated here is possible today, and less likely with each coming year and fewer and fewer White people.  Anything ‘possible’ within today’s magic democracy is a chimera, lipstick on the pig of racial reality.  Who wants realpolitik within a multiracial system?  Not I.  And f**k Kissinger, Nixon, Johnson, and any White silent or boomer or self-proclaimed ‘greatest generation’ who wants to piously proclaim “We did the best we could.”

                    You mean what @Zman posted about Detroit? He’s right. We will see if there’s anything that can be done pre-collapse but get out of the cities and educate your children well. I don’t know what there would be left to try.
I was actually speaking of the historical definition ofrealpolitik, that of Bismark. By the time Kissinger entered the scene, it had a heavy nationalist bent, and, as we probably agree, trying to save the nation is a fool’s errand. Though one that serves moneyed interests quite well…

        Correct, there are in fact 3 groups in the world:
The MeekThe GoodThe Evil
The Meek will play cleanup crew (hence the propensity for Hollywood to display them as the magical negro trope), while the Good keep the Evil at bay.
Of course, it’s all interconnected. As the Good reject the Evil, so too do the Meek reject the Good…leading to the situation Z described – the society of the Good becomes a museum.
Without the approval of the Meek, nothing matters. And all Civilizations, or whatever remains of them, become hollow

        The only thing missing from Z’s description of our future will be the need for armed security for the rich people. And by rich I mean what we think of as middle or upper middle class today. I have witnessed that on trips to the third world in Mexico and Panama. It is quite an eye-opener when your tour guide shows you his concealed weapon permit and his handgun. Or when you eat in a modest restaurant guarded by a man with a loaded shotgun inside front door. Gated communities are just that in Latin America sometimes but not always guarded by gentleman carrying rifles.

        Here’s a hypothetical question:You die and arrive at the pearly gates. An angel tells you “you lived a good life, but you can’t enter yet, you have one more circle of karma to work out.“You will be sent back to earth as a 13 year old Black male. You must live 20 years as him. You get to pick the time and place. You live 20 years in a way that works out your karma, at age 33 you’ll ascend to heaven.”I would choose Detroit from 1944 to 1964, and I challenge anyone to come up with a better answer.

Can I get a witness??Wholeheartedly agree.  Let’s concentrate on why we’re all here in this forum and not turn it into a “let’s help our fellow downtrodden black folk”.  There are tens of millions of downtrodden white folk that need to be uplifted.  Just take a drive off the interstate anywhere in WV, E TN, SW VA, W NC.  Do these folks count anymore to us?  They sure as hell don’t to TPTB against whom we all allegedly rail against.

            Really? Based on what? Who’s history are you using? Most people think that “Roots” was the history of black America. Most people don’t realize Kunta Kinte was a fictional character. Pozzed black history started almost immediately after they were given civil rights. A lot of slaves in old America gained the respect of their owners and lived good lives – or better than those they would have had in Africa as free ranging savages.It sounds awful to say it, but there is nothing wrong with young, stupid and violent black males that can’t be fixed with a horsewhip. Our ancestors knew this and created beautiful, modern citiesWhen it comes to history that is consistently edited and revised by jews and neoliberals, there are really no historical facts that we can trust anymore…

            Maui, Kona, Oahu or Kauai. Nobody cared whether you were black outside a few districts. Women actually may have found you to be exotic and thus worthy of special treatment. Most dudes would befriend you, especially outside Oahu. You could find easy work. Lots of chill vibes and things to do. 1957-1977. No burden at all.

                    You are not going to make any headway here. Pretty much everyone has either their own local situation where demographics are determinative, or they have an ideological bias they cannot see through. They literally cannot imagine localities where there is a difference between political parties. That there are actually places where Democrats are the problem we face.

        In a way, the comments on this piece remind me of the kinds of shopworn things you hear from cucks, like about the Communist threat or how they’re going to eliminate the Department of Education.
Blacks have been relatively stable at 10 to 13% of the population. Even though they are super breeders, they’re not growing thanks to their propensity for violence and the modern medical miracle of abortion.
Our problem is the other 27% + of diversity, but they’re not as easy (or fun) to pick on.

            The other 27%, while significant, don’t do 53%.  There is definitely more bang for your broken buck with a specific group.
The only other group with bigger bang for removal is(censored by USG).

                I don’t care if blacks are model citizens, I want a predominantly white European society. The other 27% make that hard to achieve. Dumping the third world in here is replacing whites. That’s a bigger issue to me than any particular behavioral peculiarities of blacks.
Look at the bright side of that 53%. They’re in prison so they can’t breed.

                    The whole problem is too many of those 53% doers are NOT in prison.  Perhaps you missed my reference (13% of the population do 53% of the violent crime – does not necessarily mean they are prosecuted/jailed for it)

                            I’m not a normie. I know this stuff fairly well. My point is that 13% has always been here and you’re not going to do anything about it. Blame your dumbass great-great-great-grandfathers for bringing them here to pick cotton for them. We can’t do anything about it.
That other 27% is the problem TODAY and it keeps growing and growing and growing. We can do something about that.

            Not gonna downvote, but just say there’s a bit of illogic in your comment. Blacks cause most of the damage and worse, seem to be in ascendancy wrt their minority status. In short, they punch above their demographic weight so to say. Therefore it is logical that when negatives of diversity are spoken about, they are on the top of the list to be discussed.

                This is typical conservatism, still fighting yesterday’s wars. It’s like all the people fixated on abortion and vote accordingly, can’t see the forest for the trees.The problem with blacks and their dysfunction as well known. Don’t let that be a distraction from the even bigger problem, which is the kumbaya mentality where an Indian or a Paki or a Chinese is interchangeable with a European White.I don’t care if every single Indian is a model citizen and all whites are lazy metheads and the dregs of society. I want to be around people generally like myself.We have far bigger fish to fry these days than worrying about welfare queens. That is so 1980s.

                    Not gonna downvote, but not worrying about welfare queens is how we got into this mess. If Congress didn’t blow money like a Okinawan whore blows, you know, you wouldn’t need a double income to afford a house and kids.
