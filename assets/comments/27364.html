            From what I recall Dumbledore‚Äôs secret is that he likes a good stiff wand straight up the old evacuatus fecesium
Not trying to pile on here but really hoping you at least pirated this.  If you paid for your KIDS to be exposed to it you need to think about that.

        Meanwhile, truck stop chains Loves and Pilot are warning of impending diesel shortages in the Eastern US, specifically the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states:

Prep accordingly, especially readers in those areas.

            While I am not a direct user thereof, I wonder how bad a shortage we may be facing. Like most Americans, I buy stuff at the store. Damned near all of it shipped by diesel burning vehicles, over long distances. I believe this holds for sea transit, too.If there is anything to be thankful for, it‚Äôs the simple fact that if it‚Äôs being breathlessly reported on the news or the latest ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù in your local daily, the issue is portrayed far worse than it really is. Not saying it‚Äôs never a problem, but the press is rather known to turn a molehill into a mountain.It‚Äôs sort of like my parents‚Äô expectations for me: seemed promising, but never amounted to much üòÄ

        I think you got democracy wrong. Direct democracy is a tyranny of the people, but representative democracy is a tyranny of the elite. In direct democracy the voter can directly vote himself money, but in a representative democracy that has to be funneled through representatives. However, the representatives actually work for the ruling class, and so any theft will have most of the profits skimmed off by that ruling class.

        I agree with Lefty. Everything wrong with this country is the fault of the White man. At one time, White men were in complete control of perhaps the most economically powerful and technologically advanced nation that ever existed. White male leaders, who were already in the upper social strata and guarenteed a comfortable financial  existance for the rest of their lives, sold us out. And even to this day, it is White male enforcers in the criminal justice system that protect the status quo.

        That‚Äôs pre-supposing many of them even know they need to keep the plates spinning. I think a lot of them believe the plates will spin themselves and no effort is required on their part. In fact I‚Äôd go so far as to say many of them believe the plates will continue to spin no matter what they do.If you think you can shut down people‚Äôs movements and activities due to a disease and think you won‚Äôt affect the economy you‚Äôll pretty much buy into any idea. Hell, a bunch of them don‚Äôt even really believe in the relationship between supply and demand.

            They also fail to understand many plates are interdependent upon each other to remain spinning.
I think a lot of that stems from the modeling experts. That bunch seems convinced their models are dead on representations of real life and that variables in both spaces may be zeroed out with no ill effects.

                Now, now, the modelers think very highly of themselves. In fact, they‚Äôre so confident they can draw an elephant with only 17 parameters. The fact that it is not really an elephant is beside the point.

        Congressman X gets booted from office but lands a high paying lobbying job. Not only does he not leave the city, but he also gets to buy a bigger house and avoid the folks back home entirely.Hilarious.  That‚Äôs exactly what happened to my Congressman just yesterday.  A uniparty squish with an (R) next to his name.  Voted often with the Democrats; was accused of sexual monkeyshines by an underling; blamed it on being a drunkard; announced he wouldn‚Äôt run for reelection in the mid-terms; and then months later packs it in before the end of the term to join a ‚Äúbipartisan‚Äù lobbying outfit in the Imperial Capital.The sad part is there is doubtless a deep reservoir of grifters and puppets working the phones right now in an attempt to get their seat at the table.

            A decade or more ago, I attended the High School graduation of a relative (cousin) in Bethesda, Maryland. Whitman is one of the better in Montgomery County, which a roundabout way of saying that the student body is composed of the the children of shitlibs living in ridiculously valued homes.One of the speakers the ceremony was a then-current U.S. Senator from Arkansas, probably Mark Pryor. This was appropriate as he‚Äôd graduated from the same high school. At the time I thought it odd an Arkansas Senator would hail from Maryland. Tonight I did some quick searching and the answer is very reasonable: his own father David was also a Senator whose term began in 1978, thus explaining Mark‚Äôs presence. Truly an incestuous business! üôÇ

        The world-historical irony of Biden and Zelensky as the tribunes of ‚Äúour Democracy‚Äù is that between the two of them ‚Äî 81 Million Vote Biden and ‚ÄúPeace with Russia‚Äù Zelensky ‚Äî they pretty well have put an end to the idea of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù as a serious form of government.

        ‚ÄúSince forever, people have always known and accepted that politicians lie to the voters about what they will do if elected. The lying was almost always in the form of exaggeration or promises that were desirable, but unrealistic.‚ÄùThis has already been legalized for businesses in the concept of puffery. You can legally claim that your product is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, partially because of opinion, and partially because there is no real measurable form of ‚Äúbest‚Äù. It is merely an expression of opinion by a seller that isn‚Äôt made as a representation of fact.  You also see ridiculous claims in the supplements/vitamins business. Vitamins and supplements do not require the in depth testing that ‚Äúmedicines‚Äù do (excluding vaccines, of course). They are just a lab coated version of snake oil and rely on the faith of the customer to work. Why would politics be any different?

                I downvoted because of the remarks concerning vitamins and supplements.I am nearly 70, and asthmatic, although thanks to the guidance of my lady pulmonologist at the University of Penn‚Äôs Harron Lung Center, this is under superb control. But, given my affliction, in concert with my age, I do supplement my nutrients to support my immune system on my own initiative. During the 3+ years since my asthma medication was optimized, I have had 0 upper respiratory infections. When it seemed as if I might be falling prey to a viral respiratory infection, a day of Zicam tabs (zinc being the active ingredient) with extra rest and fluids, and poof, it was gone. I have subsequently added zinc tabs 2x weekly to my supplementation along with other supplements that assist in uptake of zinc.I am a pureblood, and this lends extra motivation to defend myself. My wife, in January of 2020 experienced a bout of what in hindsight was likely Covid. I did practice my accustomed careful hygiene while tending to her during that time, and I escaped unscathed. I am out in public shopping on an at least weekly basis, sickies all around me (maskless as soon as the NJ mask restrictions lessened). In my estimation, it is likely that my meticulous adherence to system boosting supplementation has lain at the root of my good health.As to the lack of testing of vitamins and supplements, it were perhaps wise to consider that the ‚Äúhealth authorities‚Äù themselves have been loath to support these studies; maybe they want to avoid finding out that such ‚Äì rational ‚Äì supplementation is actually effective? Do you trust the dietary advice of these people, in thrall to the pharmaceutical/medical complex as they are? I don‚Äôt, as they are as corrupted by the money, and the allure of career-hopping from being first a regulator,  to then working for a manufacturer, and vice versa as they seem to be to support the scams.Vide:https://m.theepochtimes.com/non-profit-watchdog-uncovers-350-million-in-secret-payments-to-fauci-collins-others-at-nih_4454636.htmlIf you want to see some snake oil, just squeeze some of these snakes, and bucko, you can get by the barrel.Regards,JJ

        Initially I had assumed that the Roe v Wade thing was meant to rile up the libs and motivate them to vote to try and offset the expected midterm losses for the Dems.  But it seems like an early trigger pull for that, and the last time they activated the radicals to tear up cities for St. Floyd it was meant to harm the incumbent Trump.Given that the left‚Äôs pets are attacking churches, I suspect the real aim is to get all those disillusioned right-wingers back in the sheepfold voting Republican to save Jesus from Antifa.  The sheep get to think they‚Äôve scored a victory over baby murder when the legislature flips to the Republicans who proceed to keep on doing the thing they actually care about: using taxes and money printing to buy MIC weaponry and ship it to Ukraine to get blown up by Russia and receive their bribes.

        A very excellent piece today. The parallels between democracy and capitalism are indeed striking. Perhaps chief among them, as Z indicates, is ideological uniformity. He points this out with regard to the uniparty, but it holds equally true for the corporate world. Businesses, once they reach a certain size‚Äìperhaps when they become publicly traded‚Äìall adopt anti-white racism as their core tenet. It doesn‚Äôt matter how conservatively they began (see Disney, for example), they all come to revolve around hating whitey.And just as it‚Äôs impossible to punish the uniparty because any AWR you defenestrate is replaced by another AWR, you cannot logically punish Nike by refusing to buy their stuff because Addidas, if one bothers to investigate, pushes the same anti-white crap. Oh, you could punish Nike, I suppose, by refusing to patronize it, but you still need shoes. Instead of giving your hard-earned wampum to Baal, you give it to Pazuzu instead. For this reason, the corporations have no incentive to drop their AWR.Democracy and late-stage capitalism are closed systems. And the only way to open them up again is to violently shatter them.

            From a Christian perspective this problem is an old one‚Ä¶ hey we don‚Äôt want to eat meat sacrificed to idols but we need meat and it‚Äôs ALL sacrificed to idols around here.Basically the Book says ok well avoid if you can and the occasional symbolic refusal is important in front of others who may be mislead into thinking you‚Äôre endorsing the practice.  But yeah you need meat and it‚Äôs not your fault what meaning evil men have attempted to attach to it.Good people should avoid the megacorps where they can but it‚Äôs not up to us if every grocery store has pervert flags.  This is no excuse optional participation like consuming media products.  It‚Äôs also why it makes sense to avoid something like Nike even if the other shoe companies are just as evil.  Nike is *identified* in the public mind with evil in a way others arent‚Ä¶  so when you wear Nike logos you‚Äôre advertising to onlookers that you endorse evil.  This can have a bad effect on THEM.  This shores up the sick cultural consensus for the comformist weakminded (aka normies)It doesnt matter so much about the company getting the money, thanks to the complete end of antitrust we hardly have a choice about that.

            My latest pairs of shoes (sneakers/trainers) were about $18 a pair from the local Wal*Mart. They were of sufficient quality that I‚Äôve obtained six pairs. With inflation firing up, I could think of it as stocking up.
I can‚Äôt preventthe shoes being made by underpaid child labor in a country where the concept of environmental and labor safeguards has never been considered. But I‚Äôd sooner wear a pair of no-name shoes than pay some inflated price most of which is profit just paying for some fancy brand name, and in a firm that is almost just as you describe.

        People will vote Repub because they‚Äôre the people who have always voted Repub. As they die off and are replaced by their children, who will not vote Repub, and by the millions of aliens who have slithered across the border, and will not vote Repub, the GOP will fade away. Perhaps it will be replaced by a party that represents the interests of Heritage Americans. Perhaps not. If so, something of Western civilization might be saved in some of the territory of the former USA. If not, not.

            The second option is what will happen.  They will simply drag the GOP even more left of where it already is.The GOP is really not an ideological party, at least not in the sense the voters think they are.  It is a machine for getting people elected.  This is why Lindsey Graham is still the Senator from South Carolina.  The area is solid GOP, but solid GOP just means they vote for whatever scumbag puts a big fat R next to his name no matter how ridiculous he is.  This is why some of the strongest GOP areas have some of the most ridiculous people.

It‚Äôs hard to know who should be held in greater contempt: the cynics who change their names, or those who vote based upon it.

            Not voting republican because of our internal 5d chess mastermind logic will have the same effect as voting republican or voting democrat.
So many people scoffing at people naively thinking voting can make any difference but failing to realize that for all the same reasons NOT voting will also make no difference.
‚ÄúNot voting HARDER‚Äù isnt working either

                Not voting harder hasn‚Äôt really been tried!
Seriously though, at some point, not voting harder does have the effect of discrediting the system.  Hard to claim the mandate of heaven with &lt;30% voter participation.  Not that it would stop anyone from claiming the mandate anyway.
Another good point someone once made: If you voted, you voluntarily participated in the scam, so you have no right to complain.

                NoOneAtAll:   Somehow you seem to have missed the memo that there is no voting (or not voting) our way out of this.  The cloud people will do what the cloud people want to do, regardless of the illusion of a voter mandate, however manufactured.Not voting is for self respect, for not endorsing the travesty of representative government, for not wasting one‚Äôs limited time on the fallacy of electoral politics.  Politicians and bureaucrats are all crooks and liars.  Not one of them has even the fig leaf of concern for heritage Americans.  There is no political measure or policy choice that can fix a decayed empire.There is nothing anyone can do at this point, other than look to his own family and future and plan to try to survive the onslaught.  And rubbing one‚Äôs hands in anticipation of a ‚Äòred wave‚Äô in November ‚Äì after all the historical evidence that it will make no difference ‚Äì is beyond absurdity and into the realm of the woke changing the laws of thermodynamics.

                    Right, that‚Äôs my point.  Over here people spend way too much time congratulating themselves on not voting.
If political solutions are unavailable then act like it.  Quit hoping that you‚Äôll bring republicans to heel by some tiny despised faction vociferously not voting.
If the republicans knew you did vote or support them they‚Äôd disavow you in a minute anyway.  They don‚Äôt even WANT our votes, the whole hustle depends on them NOT appealing to us.

        The politics is a Punch and Judy show, or to paraphrase Shakespeare, a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. In Marxist theory, the political system is part of the superstructure of society while the economic system of monopoly capital would be the base that controls what happens politically. Baran and Sweezy wrote a book about 56 years back, titled ‚ÄúMonopoly Capital‚Äù, which goes into this in much more detail. You‚Äôre probably familiar with it.The economic system of the USA is part of the global financial economic system that also subsumes the economies of Europe and Japan. It is to be expected that their politics will be similar to those of the USA ‚Äî i.e., a Macron or Johnson will be similar to an Obama or Biden. As you say, the politicians become mere figureheads, with no agency of their own.The problem arguably is that since the ‚Äô70s there has been an irrevocable economic decline, punctuated by tepid half-recoveries (trumpeted as booms). The global financial oligarchy, through its political stooges, has nothing to offer the electorate. And the electorate is in any case only needed to rubber-stamp elite choice, to provide a fig leaf of legitimacy to a crooked system of governance and privilege. That, incidentally, is where the asinine leer of Biden comes from, to be facetious.The voters are not stupid. In the 2016 election many of them saw that Trump could not deliver on his promises (MAGA). But still, he was more appealing than Hillary, who was offering nothing but going around manically repeating ‚Äúlove trumps hate.‚Äù Hence the support for Trump. I voted for him myself, and again in 2020. Even though I can see that the system is decrepit and ossified and utterly beyond reform.

        &gt; . The economy is a disaster and rapidly deteriorating due to a pointless war of choice against Russia.
Read somewhere that the plan to stop all Russian oil exports will crash the German GDP by 12%.  For those keeping score, that is a Great Depression level contraction, and who knows the secondary effects that will happen afterwards.
The only country that wouldn‚Äôt be left in ruins is France, who was pragmatic enough to keep their nuclear power plants.

            I think the scam is to allow the Greeks to ship Russian oil through a series of middlemen. This will raise prices and keep the rubles flowing to Russia. This so the girls running foreign policy can finger wag at Putin.

                Fracking is a pipe dream.  The best analogy i ever heard with regards to it:  Picture a drunk who is all out of booze and all the bars are closed but he needs a drink.  Now picture him on the floor with a straw trying to suck up day old spilled beer.
Think about it, the tech to do it has been around since at least the 50‚Äôs, why didn‚Äôt we do it then?

            All it‚Äôll do is create a black market for Russian oil.  The ‚Äústop all Russian oil exports‚Äù only affects Europe.  India, China, the other BRICS countries‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt care less about it.  It‚Äôs unenforcable except by direct military attacks on Russian tankers and pipelines which defeats the purpose of running a mercenary war in Ukraine to launder money and pay off donors in the US.  A hot war with Russia risks the elites themselves because they know in a hot war that cities like NY, LA, Chicago and DC would be bulls-eyed first by the Russians.  If the elites were to lose those 4 cities alone, the entire electoral balance of power would shift away from Liberals for a century‚Ä¶because most of them would be dead.Germany will build a secret underground pipeline to Russia if they have to.  They have no interest in destroying their economy over this, and way too many of the elites will die in a nuclear war with Russia.

        I wonder if, on the long scale, the problem is with liberal democracy as such, or what I call (for lack of a better term) information velocity.England under the Protectorate was every bit as ideological as AINO. If ever there was a pure theocracy outside of the Sandbox, that was it. And yet, English life in the shires wasn‚Äôt that much different under Cromwell than it was under Charles, because Cromwell didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to monitor his subjects‚Äô lives in real time.Even more importantly, his subjects didn‚Äôt have the wherewithal to monitor Cromwell‚Äôs actions in real time. Cromwell on his worst day was a more serious man than every single Swamp Thing put together are on their very best, but he could make empty, grandiose gestures with the best of them. The reason he didn‚Äôt go that well more often, I hypothesize, is because to be effective, the empty grandiose gesture has to happen more or less in real time. Courtiers gesture to each other all the time, and it‚Äôs quite effective, but always kept in check by the fact that these guys know each other personally and communicate in real time. By the time the grandiose empty gesture reaches the shires, the people can see it for what it is.And that has a cost. Cromwell could have himself painted ‚Äúwarts and all‚Äù at the very height of his power to flatter his Puritan vanity, but it cost him ‚Äî if you‚Äôre going to carry on like a king, and pass your kingdom down to your son, you‚Äôd better do it all the way. He didn‚Äôt.Increasing information velocity homogenizes the culture, such that empty gestures become the coin of the realm. Had Cromwell‚Äôs government disappeared overnight, English life would‚Äôve continued much as before, because they had ‚Äî by necessity ‚Äî strong local institutions. If the AINO government disappeared overnight, society would collapse. Not because the AINO government is so important in its subjects‚Äô lives, but because it isn‚Äôt ‚Äî absent the constant real-time freakouts of The Current Thing, people would realize that there‚Äôs nobody in charge; that they live, effectively, in anarchy, at the whim of whichever grievance group pressures whatever corporation into acting.The AINO government is literally the ‚Äúcircus‚Äù part of ‚Äúbread and circuses.‚Äù Liberal democracy would work fine if the shires were forced via information velocity to send their representatives to the Capital for a short season, and then return. No real-time communications, no problem.

Nothing will change until the environment changes because of the Comfort First Imperative. Joe Normie will not get up off the couch and roll up his sleeves until he has no choice but to do so or die.
At the end of WWI, real hardship fell like a sledgehammer on Germany and then hyperinflation poured gasoline on the fire. It is said that those who are ignorant of history are condemned to repeat it. It may be instructive to read about what happened in Germany between 1919 and 1923. And one interpretation of ‚Äúinstructive‚Äù is ‚Äúhow to.‚Äù

            The USSR of WWII had a population of 200 million; about 25 million USSR soldiers and civilians died horribly in that war, roughly 1 in 8.The US has never seen suffering like this. The New England area in particular hasn‚Äôt seen any war since the Revolution in the 1700s (small scale in war of 1812)This explains the sleepwalking into a war disaster. Their preening is based on a belief that they‚Äôll never, ever suffer real harm.The Russians are very, very tough. The fact that so few Republicans opposed the ‚ÄúUkraine lend lease‚Äù Act isn‚Äôt surprising, but it proves completely that we‚Äôre led by madmen.

                One of the reasons why Joe Normie won‚Äôt get off the couch is because he has let his body go to squish for over a decade and he knows that he would be worthless in a fight to the death. Even with a firearm in his hands, chances are that he couldn‚Äôt hit anything he was aiming at and really can‚Äôt even run away after his magazine is empty. In the Ukraine, the shit stain has conscripted fat men in their 40s &amp; 50s and sent them to the front lines without training and left there to act as target practice for Russian artillery. That is the fate that awaits the suburban normie here in the USA. If you don‚Äôt want to become Biden canon fodder, get fit now. It‚Äôs not too late to start.

                    To your points, I believe they will attempt some form of covert conscription as we ramp into WW3 this summer.
I think overt conscription would be a step too far, but I think they are crazy enough to attempt that as well.

                    One thing we do have‚Äîin spades‚Äîare veterans!  Those folk who‚Äôve been in the service, trained, and in many instances in combat.  I have no doubt those men will step up to the plate, they are now even now doing so‚Äîsuch as along the border.  I‚Äôve been with them myself.No trained veteran is going to step out with a fat, out of shape ‚ÄúNormie‚Äù and put his ass on the line with such a f**k up.  Effective teams don‚Äôt work that way.  If a bunch of ‚Äúbubba‚Äôs‚Äù want to play Rambo, then let them commit suicide. They‚Äôll sort themselves out one way or the other, the rest of us will be better off.

                    Mass conscription to fight a land war in Ukraine against an opponent with nukes would be the end of the Republic.
Get fit because the BLM and Antifa riots of 2018-2019 were just a warm up for the run up to the 2024 election.  Or general health.
But mainly get fit because presentation matters;  no matter how articulate or smart you may be, no one listens to a fat slob.

Americans will deal with nearly anything as long as they can have a chance at virtue signaling about how morally superior they are to any audience that will listen. In fact, maybe I should even have made that #1.

            Number one is moral superiority, as it seems many Americans are happy to starve to death or get murdered if they can exclaim what a good person they are before they croak.
An an age of virtue, a man would die for principles and be perfectly content if no one knew, or even if everyone hated him for it.  In our new hive-mind world, everyone needs to know and clap.

Ironically, what everyone needs to ‚Äúknow‚Äù is really to ‚Äúthink‚Äù.  Most virtue signaling is just a lie‚Äîthe individual signaling has done nothing virtuous and is most often a fraud.  We live in a world of lies.

            From what I understand the drug trafficking business has 2 purposes:1) If a group of people are addicted, they are useless and their society is destroyed, hence they can never be a threat to the imperial state of the Cloud People2) This is how the Deep State (C.I.A. et. al.) runs and controls everything from the shadows, by maintaining an off-budget business. You just can‚Äôt have items in the budget such as overthrowing governments, destroying people, and just being plain evil out in plain sight where the dirt people can see it.

        it seems like the current crop of normies will have to die off (one way or the other) before anything different can take root.  my sense ‚Äì from my own kids, and things i read online ‚Äì is that people under 30, now, do not buy into all the political lying going on.   not like boomer cons do, who eat it up like pig slop.  gen z won‚Äôt be pinochet level based, but they will be far more based then gen B ever was.the wild card in all of this is how rapidly the bidenites are destroying the economy, and provoking other countries.  the slope of decline is  rapidly approaching vertical; there may well be an intermediate stage like there was in Spain (after their civil war).

                B125 has it largely, with one caveat. Sorry, but this is my specialty ‚Äì I am surrounded by hundred of 17-18 year olds every day. They are largely apathetic and unplugged from politics WITH the exception of the indoctrination. They absolutely use the right pronoun, if you follow, without ever questioning it ‚Äì gay rights are as accepted and unconscious as breathing, as is most other liberal talking points. Immigrants built this country, bienvenidos! Etc. Multiculturalism!!!The world of social media has enabled the indoctrination of the youth because whatever is presented online is the world (to them). The curated nature of social media ensures that the world view they adopt is the one TPTB want. They don‚Äôt get involved in politics ‚Äì they absorb the deeper stuff.In contrast with B, I find this way worse, for at least if you follow politics you occasionally hear a Ron Paul type question the official narrative. Paul‚Äôs explanation of why the civil rights act was awful was one of the events that lead to opening my eyes.

        Starting in 1976 with Ford, Republicans promised us a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade. 4 GOP presidents, 46 years and 62 million dead babies later, looks like they fulfilled that promise. Democracy in action!

            I know none of the other Republicans but Trump would have beat Hillary in 2016, but for argument‚Äôs sake say any of them did.  I would estimate over half of the primary field would have nominated a known squish when Ruth Bader Ginsberg died in order to placate the left.  Jeb and Kasich would have without a doubt.  Trump‚Äôs judges might not be great in total, but at least it appears they got this right.

                Correct.  That‚Äôs why it took 50 years to overturn a bad decision of SCOTUS (assuming they don‚Äôt chicken out).  But regardless, the damage is done.  50 years to get the population used to abortion on demand.  Abortion is not going to be eliminated in the US.  At best, it will settle down to first trimester from partial birth.  A few states perhaps worse, some better.

            Correct though amusingly   you could actually could have a wind powered aircraft carrier. It would be tricky to make and carry only one or two aircraft and maybe some maintenance supplies.
You‚Äùd want a backup motor on the ship running on av gas or whatever the planes are using . But doable.

        This is a good time to note again that none of the European leaders have children. They are a suicide cult that has no future and that is what they have chosen for themselves and for the people they rule over.  Here, we have a variation on the theme as the dingbat VP has no children of her own and of course Biden abused and molested all his children and other people‚Äôs children. We are ruled by a demonic suicide cult

                    I moan about the kids and young sterilized by the vaxx, but all the kids damaged by overvaccination- that is, the autistic kids- they aren‚Äôt going to have kids either.
What, they‚Äôll marry, hold a job, buy a house, etc.?  We boomers and genX, heirs to mass vaxxing, didn‚Äôt have many kids either.  Not a coincidence.

Vaccines did not exist  in 10 AD and lead wasn‚Äôt everywhere.
Simply, cities mean smaller families.
Our extra sauce decline over the last few year  is tech driven.
As for the MNRA gene mods/vaccines ? I honestly do not know what effects they‚Äôll have.

            But is it really the leadership‚Äôs fault?  Because it‚Äôs not just the leadership class who doesn‚Äôt have children.  Two generations failed to reproduce while maintaining retirement schemes that cannot work without population growth.  Even if they weren‚Äôt importing 3rd worlders who cannot maintain Western Civilization, a nation of foreigners is not going to work themselves to death supporting old white people they hate.I don‚Äôt know about Europe, but in America, we were warned over and over when the Boomers could still have children.

                Tars: It‚Äôs a wide-spread sickness that I just cannot comprehend.  A few of the ‚Äòhomesteading‚Äô couples whose videos I‚Äôve watched have no children, and have proclaimed their intention to have none in the future.  Yet they‚Äôre all about growing their own ‚Äònatural‚Äô food and living in a self-reliant and sustainable manner.
For what, for God‚Äôs sake?  For whom?  The utter selfishness and solipsism of people who think they‚Äôre the center of the universe never fails to astound me.

                I don‚Äôt know about Europe, but in America, we were warned over and over when the Boomers could still have children.I have no memory of any such warnings whatsoever.That would be muh biggest gripe with the Greatests &amp; Silents: That they were so clueless as to the machinations of the Frankfurt School that they bequeathed the Boomers and Xers with literally no survival skillz whatsoever.Much of muh adult life has involved throwing muhself wholeheartedly into luddism in order to learn some basic survival skillz [from how to build an homestead to how to f!re a g*n to how to get a girlfriend off of chemical ab0rtifacients and thrust some bunz into her oven].The Greatests &amp; the Silents bequeathed me with precisely jack sh!t when it came to questions of both survival [of the personal corpus] &amp; meta-survival [of the White Race].I had to remedially teach muhself all of that sh!znat.

                Pike is the centerpiece of a new Star Trek series on Paramount+. Due to time crystals in the mines of a Klingon planet, he is aware of the cause and time of his death. I wonder if he can avert it so the chair never happens. Star Trek loves time travel stories. I always imagined the writers being out of ideas and one of them yells ‚ÄúTIME TRAVEL‚Äù and they all rejoice.

                    Robert Heinlein‚Äôs short storyAll You Zombiesis a great bit of sci-fi time-travel satire that pokes fun at the ridiculous plot device.

        The monopoly of political power in the hands of a few is dying from a thousand small wounds and in time it will collapse from trying to maintain itself.
Why was the shegetz, Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike, replaced with the chosen, William Shatner as James Tiberius Kirk?
And why was there never any doubt but that the chosen, Leonard Nimoy, would play the wise old uber-sage, Mr Spock?
Why did Shatner &amp; Nimoy come to so despise one another?
