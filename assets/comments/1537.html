        So you’ve seen the movie Idiocracy, right Walt?IMHO, Walt’s premise, full of memes and shortcuts I readily understand, is probably worthy of expansion, simplification, (and in cooperation with Zman?)- publication, probably in a minimum of 7-8 (up to 16) stories  for children’s level comprehension.(Though not necessarily for “children”.)The problem is,”the heroes”  should NOT be denied the aura of “Sheesh, what a DICK!”  unlike (ie)MASH, The Cat in the Hat, or The Merchant of Venice.

        When I started venturing out on my own, driving, shopping, living away from my parents, I was shocked by the amount of boorish, idiotic behaviour from people in an otherwise civilised society. I thought I was surrounded by morons but I came to realise that about 20% of people were causing 80% of the problems. I don’t have any evidence to back up my claim but I discovered that the people getting caught drink-driving were the same people who throw fast-food trash out of their moving vehicle. They are the same people who own savage dogs, blast their music at 2am on a Tuesday morning, get neck tattoos, watch garbage television, get in financial trouble with store charge cards and claim to be able to see your aura.With such an enormous population in the United States where people with low I.Qs and disgraceful work-ethics can easily survive and multiply, there are going to be some real doozies. Think about something with very low-odds say, 1 in a million. In the US, there are more than 300 examples walking around.One can bang their head up against the wall over all the dipshits ruining their day. I personally like to profit from them. They often want to be parted from their money. They cost us millions of dollars in terms of security guards at bars, insurance premiums and government financed meth-rehab programs. Sure, they give a lot back in lottery tickets but they deserve to pay much, much more.
