        America has been engaged in a War on Poverty (TM) for decades. If things have only gotten worse during that time, then the war policies may be the PROBLEM not the SOLUTION. Instead of doubling down on what the country has been doing, perhaps it would be more effective if it stopped doing what it has been doing and rethought the entire problem. IMO it’s hardly worth taking people like Kareem seriously until the football stadiums and basketball arenas are empty.  As long as the seats are full of fans who pay good money to watch grown men play games, then the country clearly does not think poverty is that big an issue.

        He got it more right than he intended to when he says it’s always been “class warfare.”That’s true, and “class warfare” has always, all ways, been riots in the streets fought by poor people who were egged on by their “betters.” Ever since the French Revolution when the likes of Diderot, Voltaire and Rousseau sat safely in warm rooms of the academy writing screeds to inspire others to take their chances for them, it’s been about “class warfare.”There would be no “class warfare” without Communism, and there would be no Communism without “class warfare.” Watch the institutional left flock to Ferguson, and tell me I’m wrong.I’ve always had a lot of respect of you, Kareem, but I’m losing it.
