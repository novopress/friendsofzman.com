        Dear Z Man,
Look back through the past 300 years’s economic history and one can see crashes, panics occur from time to time.
1929 is a long way off, a distant memory, for the USA and the world at large but perhaps a repeat of that collapse is near given: unfunded liabilities of the USA estimated at 120+ trillions of dollars and hedge funds becoming bubbles of perhaps more than 100 trillion of dollars.
Either the end of the line is hyper inflation or collapse I fear. I see no soft landing.
Dan Kurt

        It’s noise. All these pundits pulling hairs out of a few tents of a percent. The economy is not going off a cliff. Things may not be great, but they aren’t so bad either.

        Ditto. Zero hedge is a great source of information and perspective, but you do have to pick and choose. A lot. Quite like the internet.The general tone matches up with it’s readers, young, and enthusiastic that they have overcome a massive level of misinformation. What they have yet to realize is that is only the first level, the box inside the box. Modesty is a great virtue when trying to learn economics and politics. No one can learn when he thinks he already knows.There is no ten year period in my adult life where I did not move farther right, and there’s five of them. That is because either the old standard holds true and I’ve gotten crankier with age, or because all true enlightenment is found on the right.
