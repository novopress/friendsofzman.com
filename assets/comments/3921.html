        Many moons ago I served on a jury and one of the cases was a young woman who, on being confronted by her irate father when arriving home in the wee small hours thought the best way to avoid being in trouble was to claim she had been raped some hours before.The subsequent court case on which I was required to weigh up along with another 11 people was done very properly and carefully (real life courts are, at least in the UK, incredibly slow and careful in their conduct and not given to thrilling outbursts — as one might believe from the best TV shows  — of amazing revelations and dramatic confessions.) The poor weary prosecution soon understood that here was a case where it was an inebriated, somewhat tubby girl was more scared of her angry dad than the consequences of a glib excuse.The lad, who may have been many things but rapist was not one of them on this occasion at least, had tried to cheat on his girlfriend by chatting up the tubby girl in a pub. Actually, he chatted her up outside by the car park (yes, the UK does have warm nights occasionally) and the girl’s mates ventured out a couple of times to check Ms Tubs was okay. She was, so they went back to drinking inside leaving the lad not getting very far with the easy-going lass.Well, even in the industrial north of England such allegations of rape are taken seriously (sorry, feminists, but the cops do care more than you might think) and the lad was arrested and put on trial. The outcome was pretty predictable from an early stage and the only excitement was the prosecution getting a momentary burst of joy when the lad admitted that he had tried to phone his regular girlfriend halfway through the chatting procedure. But, as playing away from home was not an indictable offence, the moment passed and gloom returned to the Crown.Justice was done from what we could see and my final view was the two families involved glaring at each other as lad left the court a free man.I don’t know if this one case was recorded as a near miss, a false allegation or more evidence of how terrible men are, but I am glad I saw it for what it was.

        I always smile and nod when I hear the old “Yeah, I was drunk and with him in his bed but I told him to stop….”Ladies, understand, that the animal in a man takes over when he in the throes of sexual arousal. We tend to think in a way that is different to how we act when ordering paint or removing a broken hard-drive. Nature and its need to reproduce takes over. Rational thought goes out the window. Understand!So many women want freedom without responsibility when it comes dealing with white men. They wouldn’t walk around the ghetto lip-flapping this nonsense. That’s how I know they are full of shit.“Walk around the ghetto saying that…”“OK I Will….”“Alright I’ve got my keys, you got your jacket?”“What? Right now? No way.”“Case closed – I win.”

        There was a stir some months ago from a “feminist” activist who walked NYC for a few hours while a hidden camera recorded “harassment”. Oh the things women had to endure in “our” society.I asked my daughter, 26, if she had seen the video ( I am her only deprogrammer). Oh yes, she had seen it. Terrible the things they have to endure. She walks, in Hollywood,  every day for 45 minutes for health, but is sometimes hassled, carries a machete and a can of wasp spray (my idea). I asked her how many of the eighty cat callers on the video–mostly hey babes but a few men aggressively walking behind, aside, or in front of her–how many were white. She couldn’t answer. I told her four, all from a distance. I asked her if any of the trouble she was getting in LA was from white men. She didn’t answer. I asked her why she was complaining to the big bad white power structure about Negroes and Mexicans instead of directing her attention to men who were afraid to ask her for a date.I have deprogrammed my girl since she was eight years old and someday these things will click and she will be a conservative, but the fact is that the democratic culture overwhelms introspective thought. This train goes one way and always has.
