        Any moral code that leave open the possibility of murder being moral is inherently defective.
—-But what if killing one person can save the lives of many? The word murder versus kill have different meanings, the later alluding to premeditation and malice against an innocent subject.
I think you’re reducing the issue of free market capitalism the most extreme possible outcome, that somehow this justifies murder.

            I’m well aware of the trolley problem. I’m also aware of where it leads:Now, think of another imaginary scenario. You are a doctor in a small town. One of your patients needs a new heart. Another needs a new liver. Two others need kidneys and a fifth needs a lung transplant. All of these people are friends and neighbors, in addition to being patients. One day a stranger comes into your office looking for some help with a cut. You discover that he is a perfect match for your five patients waiting for organ donors. Do you kill the stranger and save your friends? Or, do you treat the stranger and let your friends die a miserable death.That’s what makes the new religion monstrous. It does not just excuse murder, it requires it.

        If you’re so concerned about the plight of the auto dealership workers what about the welfare of all the government employees you and those on the right constantly denigrate and threaten? It’s okay to protect a salesman’s job but a teacher – or retired teacher drawing a pension – gives the CMC fits. FWIW I believe the robots and software are killing jobs – evidenced by the collapsing LFPR – the sooner we close the borders and move to national basic income the better. But in the meantime I’m in favor of paying higher prices for stuff if it keeps people employed.

            I’m not on the right. The left-right model is neither accurate or useful when mapping ideological positions. I’m more of a neo-anarcho-syndicalist. Regardless, I don’t have strong feelings for the workers at the dealership. I just prefer their interests to those of global capitalists who seek to crush them. Put another way, I don’t care for my neighbors, but I’ll be right there with them filling sandbags during a flood.
