        Abortion is an ugly horrible thing.  Living in such an ugly and horrible time with so many horrendous people who are destroying everything, it‚Äôs hard to know what is right/wrong and what should be legal.
But I can‚Äôt imagine making any woman give birth when tests show that the baby will be handicapped/retarded/sick.  I get the religious argument for it and it is compelling, but in reality I just can‚Äôt get behind it.

That‚Äôs why it probably won‚Äôt happen. Most people are closer to the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of the abortion issue and I suspect extreme positions are supported mostly as a signal for socio-political partisanship. A red-state evangelical will probably be less keen on fighting for the life of a Down‚Äôs baby if he doesn‚Äôt feel his action gives an inch to the progressives advocating for unlimited abortion.
Just my 2 cents

        The thing that I find interesting on the ‚ÄúConservative‚Äù side is the demographics of the folks aborting their kids. In NYC blacks its 50%. Those that can do math realize that its not a bad thing that these people want to destroy themselves.

            I think you‚Äôre correct.  I‚Äôll go further. The mRNA Stab, a bioweapon, WILL transfer characteristics to DNA, this will ensure a Fertility Slump (tip:IVF Stocks). Early pathology suggests the Spike Protein rushes to occupy testes and womb. Couple this with the precipitous plunge in Human Male Sperm motility since 1970, a fall of FIFTY PERCENT and the Plutocrats will be PRAYING üôè their women aren‚Äôt as effected like 99% of World Population.

        I‚Äôm guessing that the strident-shading-into-hysterical opposition of middle-aged liberal White women to any diminution of ‚Äúabortion rights‚Äù may have little to do with their own personal need for access to abortion.
Rather, ‚Äúabortion rights‚Äù has become a symbol, of the struggle against patriarchal Whitey in all its aspects, and all the evils he supposedly represents‚Äî ‚Äúracism‚Äù, ‚Äúsexism‚Äù, ‚Äúxenophobia‚Äù, ‚Äúhomophobia‚Äù, etc.‚Äî in the eyes of crazy female Progs.
When the shrieking post-menopausal Harpy rails on and on about abortion, what she‚Äôs really expressing is her hatred of White men and the traditional America they founded.

            Not only do the abortion advocates want abortion to be legal, they demand that abortions be performed.  If abortions were ‚Äúlegal but rare‚Äù as cuckservatives used to say regarding their support for legal abortions, the same harpies who pushed for it would be demanding that abortions be mandatory.

        Contrary to the shrieking of the Harpies, overturning Roe v. Wade‚Äî which claimed to find in the ‚Äúpenumbra‚Äù of the Constitution a right to abortion‚Äî would not make abortion illegal.
Rather, it would allow each State to pass its own laws regarding abortion.
It would give those States that wanted to make abortion illegal, the ability to do so; while freeing other States to make it even more readily available.
It would increase the ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù of abortion options!
I‚Äôm entirely in favor of anything that hastens/spotlights the geographic separation of GoodWhites from BadWhites.

            You are right about it being kicked back to the states. I have a couple decades as a prolife leader, and I can say that not long ago many prolifers opposed this pushing it to the states, as that would be a tacit acceptance of abortion somewhere in the USA. But now we see that the federal government, no matter which department, opposes our freedoms. Our only hope at this time is protection within a state with majority Red people. Let other states do what they wish. Let people choose where they wish to live. Abortion included.

        Well, I don‚Äôt know if all that‚Äôs true.  In fact, the most strident advocates of abortion are typically the least likely to have one.  Either they are well-married with kids, or they‚Äôre bitter aging spinsters.
And of course, the dirty little secret of the abortionists is that such procedures are way disproportionately performed among young non-white girls, and have been since 1973.  In some respects, we should be grateful to them that we don‚Äôt have an even larger truculent and violent ghetto population than we already do.

        Roe vs. Wade is enshrined in society by now. There‚Äôs no overturning it. I can just imagine the shrieks from young women upon hearing that there precious kill-a-baby right has been yanked out from under them. Chicks would definitely unite to get that right back, post-haste. And in the meantime, they‚Äôd find ways to get the abortion while going around the Supreme Court‚Äôs nuisance judgment.
No, there‚Äôs no getting rid of Roe vs. Wade.

            Getting rid of Roe doesn‚Äôt equate to outlawing abortion. The decision on abortion would transfer to the States. Some would make abortion illegal, others would make it more available.
Anything that encourages the two sides of the Great Divide to separate geographically, strikes me as a good thing.

        I‚Äôll be amazed if it‚Äôs actually overturned, but as mentioned in the post, it was mostly a White middle class issue back in the day.  That said, it was one of the several things that happened in the, say ‚Äô65 to ‚Äô85 period that pretty much doomed our culture.  Civil rights, the pill, abortion on demand and the mass influx of women into the workforce etc.  Granted it was fun to be a guy in college in those days, but the long term negative effects ultimately weren‚Äôt worth it.  However, with all the POCs, muds and joggers ascending, SCOTUS better keep it in place just to keep their numbers somewhat in check.

            Caveat maybe Texas to a degree areas with high non White  population run Leftist and will probably retain legal abortion.Also this ruling doesn‚Äôt effect birth control and  obviously can‚Äôt celibacy. According to some surveys nearly one in three  people between eighteen and thirty got no sex within a given year.This was well before Covid 19 and the disruptive effects probably made it worse.Its plausible that upwards of half the population will be celibate during peak reproductive years  in a short period of time.Also I suspect  the most  hypergamous carousel rider  gals live in Blue states and won‚Äôt even notice, The Midwest and parts of the South is where this will be most impactful,. if that is Rose is eliminated.

                You‚Äôll have to rephrase that, since I‚Äôm having trouble understanding your point. I think you called me a racist, but it might have been sarcasm. I‚Äôm not sure. However, I‚Äôve been called a racist so much that I don‚Äôt care either way.
The only reason the black population hasn‚Äôt grown is because they‚Äôre dying, quickly. Make Whites, and asians affluent and they quit having kids. Make blacks affluent, relatively, and they have a lot of kids out of wedlock, but they kill each other often so it balances out.

                Your comment about how you‚Äôre racist if you mention race reminds me of a funny episode from back when I was working with a bunch of liberals:We were going to be visited by someone from another agency, and the question arose of how will we recognize her? What does she look like?Various descriptions were offered, of how tall she was, how she wore her hair‚Ä¶.  but nobody dared mention her race. I finally asked what color she was‚Ä¶.‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs African-American‚Ä¶‚Äùas if they hadn‚Äôt noticed prior to my asking.But of course, race is generally the first thing we notice on meeting a stranger‚Ä¶.

            Abortion isn‚Äôt a reason based issue and the typical Conservative can‚Äôt even think in those terms. Its a thought crime.
As such poverty, Downs‚Äô Syndrome all that dysgenic stuff won‚Äôt even show up on the radar.
One possible side effect of this is that politics may radically shift Left. states that ban abortion may find a well organized well funded ‚Äúrestore Roe‚Äù get out the vote campaign for women  that puts many more Democrats in office.

        Reversal of abortion rights seems to be more evidence pointing to the end of the United States as a White, first world country. Say what you will, but whites across the world overwhelmingly prefer to have access to abortion. In non white countries the law says anything but the people still do what they want.The USA is now a brown country that might or might not have legal abortion, depending on which faction is currently in control. Regardless of the de jure status on abortion, it‚Äôs readily available and people just pay a doctor a few bucks under the table for the procedure.In terms of where I stand on its legality, I ask myself as usual, is it good for our people? It seems hard to tell, but I suspect it might be beneficial to ban it.Not that whites have a high abortion rate ‚Äì but it‚Äôs about removing white women‚Äôs reproductive choices. They can sleep around right now, and focus on their career, because they know *in case* of an accident, they will get an abortion. I suspect the whole sexual liberation mindset would go away without legal abortion. Tell a woman yeah, your birth control pill is 99% effective, BUT ‚Ä¶ If it fails you‚Äôre on the hook for a baby ‚Äì and she will see sex in a totally different way. They will be pushed into childbirth and family formation.I know blacks have a high abortion rate, but even in red states with 1 abortion clinic the black birth rate is below replacement. They‚Äôre badly falling for cultural leftism and that brings with it low fertility rates. In places like NYC and Chicago abortion mills would stay open as the states would keep it legal.So yes, overall i do think abortion should be banned to reduce white women‚Äôs reproductive choices. and I don‚Äôt see it affecting black birth rates much as abortion is already mostly banned in red states and they still have low birth rates.

            White women have always been able to get abortions.  Even in the 1950‚Äôs they would have one on the kitchen table, wipe it off, and the whole family would be eating meatloaf on it that evening.  The business card of the doctor who could ‚Äútake care of it‚Äù being given to the neighbor at the Tupperware party.  The late 50‚Äôs had the highest abortion rate in history.  All of society was changing rapidly even before the first hippie.  How did women get down to two or three kids when the pill wasn‚Äôt even out until the early 60‚Äôs?  There were a lot of scrape-outs in the living room and in nondescript medical building across town.  And mostly done by doctors with names ending in man‚Ä¶stein‚Ä¶berg and witz‚Ä¶

        This may be obvious, but there are different sorts of abortions, in terms of what would be the result if that abortion were prevented:On the one hand, we have the well-to-do White college girl, or the married White career woman, who gets an abortion because her birth control failed, and bearing a child is not what she prefers at the moment;On the other hand, we have the Black ghetto-dwelling ‚Äúsingle mother‚Äù, living on welfare just as her mother and grandmother are, who already has 4 kids by 4 different Black lowlifes, none of whom are around, none of whom are employed, and 2 of whom are in prison;These are very different scenarios, in terms of the probable circumstances of the life that‚Äôs being aborted:In the first case, were those White women to change their minds and go ahead and have their babies, the chances are good that that child will have a good life, and grow up to be a productive member of society.While in the case of the ghetto baby-momma, the chances are good that the child she had would turn out to be just like the lowlifes that conceived them: on welfare, in and out if jail, a net drag on society.I‚Äôm certainly glad that the Black population of America isn‚Äôt 40 million people larger than it is!

        On one hand, I support giving Christians a win on this, it shows they‚Äôre getting fed up and are resurgent as a moral force.
On the other hand, Scofield evangelicals took 50 years, also, to overturn another SCOTUS ruling:  Plessy v Ferguson, aka Jim Crow segregation.  They gave us Brown v Topeka, forced desegregation of the schools and White kids marched at bayonet point, as the ‚Äúwin‚Äù.

                What did White people get out of the civil rights legislation?In a nutshell: we got screwed!We got our freedom of association severely truncated: we lost our ability to hire who we want, to live among those we want, to rent to those we want.Fast-forwarding to the present: we lost our right to say what we want.We got caught in a never-ending cascade of ever-escalating demands, such that no matter how much we give up, how much we grovel and pander, it‚Äôs never going to be enough: Blacks keep getting angrier and angrier, demanding more and more, while we‚Äôre still condemned as ‚Äúracist White supremacists‚Äù.We got the worst deal in human history: after heaping-up an unparalleled record of achievements, we got demonized and arbitrarily canceled for the crime of being White.

            While true that abortion is pure evil, this isn‚Äôt a Christian forum so those detailed technical arguments are needed in order to convince people.For example, ending abortion forces women to endure the consequences of whoring around. That‚Äôs a critical step in bringing back the civilization-stabilizer of marriage. Women who face their lives being destroyed for an oopsie pregnancy with Chad are much better behaved.No abortion + no child support = women preferring Steady Eddie. End easy divorce for the trifecta!Abortion is about sexual liberation, not race headcount, and the proof of it is all the feminists shrieking about being ‚Äòpunished with a baby‚Äô.

        I was born in 1950, spent my teen years enjoying the ‚Äúfree love‚Äù era of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. I eventually realized that making sex into something casual was a loss, not a gain.Between my high school years and when I went to college, the ready availability of birth control pills ushered in a huge change: suddenly there was no price for having sex (or so we imagined).Prior to birth control pills, having intercourse carried with it the risk of becoming pregnant. This biological reality served as a natural brake on young peoples‚Äô impulses. When birth control pills came along, this restraint was removed: having sex no longer entailed permanent consequences.For the first time in human history, sex had been divorced from reproduction.When I was in college, I never had to worry about condoms, every girl I knew was ‚Äúon the pill‚Äù, it was something I just took for granted.Readily available abortion provided yet another disconnect from what had been‚Äî for hundreds of thousands of years‚Äî the biological reality: in which sex sooner or later resulted in children.But now, if your birth control failed, no big deal: just get an abortion. I met a woman who used abortion as a means of birth control: she‚Äôd had 7 or 8, and appeared to have no qualms about it.In the old days, marriage was viewed as a more-or-less permanent institution, centered around the children: ending your marriage was difficult, and was viewed by many as a significant personal failure: divorcees were viewed skeptically.With the advent of no-fault divorce, marriage became a temporary alliance, easy enough to bail from if one partner decided they were ‚Äúno longer in love‚Äù. Children were the victims, but no one wanted to admit that. TV shows extolled the glories of ‚Äúsingle-parent families‚Äù. Being a divorcee no longer carried a stigma.Nowadays, ‚Äúfamilies‚Äù more often than not consist of a mother and her kids, and no one even thinks to wonder where the father is. An observer from Mars would get the impression that males were not needed in the making of children.Overall, Whites do seem to be under-represented in abortion‚Äî comprising ~ 66% of the population, while accounting for 33% of abortions‚Äî and Blacks are over-represented: 13% of the population, 38% of abortions.My impression is that more of the White women getting abortions are older, with a greater percentage coming from the  middle- and upper-classes, while more of the Black women getting abortions are younger, with a greater percentage coming from the ghetto class; but I can‚Äôt point to stats to back it up, so I could be mistaken.What would America be like today, if those 63 million  kids aborted since 1973 had all been born?It‚Äôs not hard to make the case that on some levels, things would be worse; with all those unwanted kids cluttering up an already-overburdened foster system, welfare, and criminal justice systems. How many would be in jail?I knew a Black crack whore who‚Äôd had 13 kids, all of whom had been taken away by the State and placed in foster care.If each of them go on to have 13 kids of their own, our crack whore will have generated 169 grandkids. And if each of THEM go on to have 13 kids, she‚Äôd have produced 2,197 great-grandkids.Thirteen abortions would have prevented those 2,197 births.In terms of the overall effect on America: would we be better off, or worse off, with those 2,197 among us?How many of them would end up contributing, making our world better; and how many would end up on the welfare rolls, in prison, or most likely, both?And we see the same thing worldwide: the highest birthrates are found in the poorest countries, those least able to support all those kids: of the 28 countries with Total Fertility Rate greater than four, all but one of them is in sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest place in the world.And like in America, NGO‚Äôs have made free birth control available to every poor woman in those countries. For whatever reason, they just don‚Äôt choose to take advantage of it.I hope the Supreme Court rules to send abortion back to the States. Let the people in the affected localities decide.

                Yeah, things have changed!As a young man, I was extremely promiscuous for quite a while‚Äî at a time and place where if you met someone and liked them, you‚Äôd hop into bed with them. Everybody did it. Consent was assumed, and rightly so. I slept with dozens and dozens of women. Not a single one revoked consent. And I never caught a venereal disease.I  expect that‚Äôs a reflection both of the times, and of the sorts of women I was sleeping with: they were mostly (but not all) college girls, promiscuous, but at the same time, choosy. And the other guys they were screwing were likewise promiscuous, but not lowlifes. Back then, if you were sleeping with ‚Äúnice girls‚Äù, VD just wasn‚Äôt an issue.I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs still true or not.And, I was only sleeping with White women:https://www.amren.com/news/2017/11/race-differences-in-rates-of-venereal-disease-std-sti/

                It was Irish Catholic Margaret Sanger (n√©e Higgins) who was the driving force behind birth control in the US. Her parents were Irish Hunger refugees that landed in Canada and moved south. He was a 1st generation Jewish immigrant from Germany.

            All that prime white p*ssy. Imagine if instead of using and abusing it, the white men of the time collectively thot patrolled, took their one woman, and f*cked the hell out of her every night continuing the Boomer demographic momentum.
Not blaming you personally btw, we‚Äôre all products of our time and hindsight is 2020. And I can definitely see the appeal. Maybe if the white men had seen the future back then things may have been different. We took our prosperity for granted and our whiteness for granted.

        I love the recent drum beat from conservatives on ‚Äúblack babies being targeted by abortion.‚Äù  They don‚Äôt usually use the word holocaust because it would upset the J people, but euphemisms for the word.  If only those white babies had a voice like that.  How many future Trayvons have been taken out?  Skittle production is flat.  White babies never had this luxury of a defense.  From the beginning the entire media culture was stacked against them.  If you see an old movie like Fast Times at Ridgemont High with the abortion scene, you can say, ‚Äúyep, and that‚Äôs why the valley is no longer white.‚Äù  Today‚Äôs valley girl is a Mexican or some random Armo-gypsy trash.

        Rose vs Wade is inconvenient for pending and future decisions, like the vax mandate that they will rubber stamp.  Because they know what‚Äôs good for us.  They know how we should live, and they will tell us how to live every day if we let them, which we do, and a lot of people love it.

                Roe is on the block because the only Conservative group who plays the long game like the Left are the anti abortion types .They use similar strategies  and tactics though tempered by morality and like them are outcome based.Also a lot of government are terrified of population decline. Our society is based in growth and interest. Neither is possible with low fertility.Neither is an economy based on productivity so something, anything to goose numbers up is desperately wanted.Its not going to help much though. Young women will either get an under the  table abortion or travel to another state or just become more careful.Also with the dual trends of celibacy and minimalism creeping up on them along with the natural decline in available energy resources  nothing can save consumerism or modernity.Its going to change , collapse to a degree and while the elite will do anything no matte  how shabby to stay in place one more day, the doom is set.

        I acknowledge the eugenic utility of abortion in as far as it has been the primary reason the black percentage of the total population has remained stable. I assert however that it is morally disfiguring to a society, fatally so. Nor has it resulted in the white percentage of the population remaining stable since dysgenic immigration policy has been used to fill in for what baby killing has suppressed natively. As we have seen, the demands for what baby killing depravities society must tolerate and even subsidize only grows in outrageousness. Today we are passed any scruples about post-birth baby killing and created a market for dead baby parts. Who knows what tomorrow will bring? My cynical imagination never conceived we‚Äôd tolerate perverts dressed up as demon transvestites coming into the kindergartens to corrupt the most innocent. Or that the APS would officially countenance the monstrous physical and psychological abuses demanded by the criminally insane. The trial balloons of normalizing pedophilia are starting to be seen and given what has passed so far is anyone here confident that would be some kind of last straw? Today, it is easy for me to imagine a Judge Ginsberg type in the 2nd or 9th circuit finding a rationalization to make it the law and a Garland type sending henchmen out to physically force compliance.As for the demographic arguments I assert that if we are not sharing a society with blacks ( which I think is a fair rough statement of one of the goals of the DR ) their population control methods are not our responsibility. I know this leads to other problems that have to be addressed but what we are doing now a, is a major factor in the moral corruption of society and b, doesn‚Äôt achieve the ultimate practical goal.

        The whole thing has been pretty much a bait and switch operation for some time. What Roe vs. Wade did was prevent some states from making it illegal. In other words if they reverse the decision a state will then have to pass a law, or amend it‚Äôs Constitution, to make it an illegal act. In most places, zip, nada, zilch. It‚Äôs a cultural sacred cow from the past and would have died a natural death long ago without the grifters from both the left and the right keeping it on life support. Keep the people looking elsewhere while we ship their livliehoods overseas, import millions of new citizens to be, and spend all their social capital.

        ‚ÄúAbortion tourism‚Äù already has made whatever decision the Supreme Court comes up with largely moot. California, New York and other pro-abort states have written abortion rights into law.

            The people-of-uterus who can plan and carry out interstate abortion tourism are not the people whose family planning consists of ‚Äúshheeeit, whutevah mufugga.‚Äù  If this helps cull and expel the mentally ill AWFL egalitarians from hierarchy-and-order communities, I see no downside.

            This is a good point and it might mean that secession is closer than we realize.  Imagine if the conservative states ban abortion, then government housing, then immigration and affirmative action.  It could be the first snowball in an avalanche that sends liberals and minorities to their own states.  Maybe it starts with a moral issue like this, then states get more courageous and start banning proxies for other groups.

        Abortion is one of those issues I think about when I feel the need for some insomnia. On the one hand, it‚Äôs clearly murder. The worst kind of murder, on someone who doesn‚Äôt even have the theoretical possibility of defending himself.
On the other hand, consider Sasqueetchia, she of the six kids by eleven different fathers. If not for Roe‚Ä¶

            As with nearly everything else in our time, this is part of the second-best solutions we have come up with after our rulers outlawed the more gentle ways of managing the problem of vibrancy. Freedom of association, even in its more unkind forms, never dismembered 40 million black babies. To accomplish that, you have to end the right to associate with whom you like.

I am a christian conservative and I avoid the abortion issue like the plague. Part of me looks at the crazy eyed spinsters that want to castrate their sons and make them into daughters‚Ä¶ and the legions of good for nothing blacks throwing their useless eaters in the dumpster‚Ä¶ and it is hard to see a downside. Not sure if I trust the clergy and their heirarchs to think for me on that one either. The Darwinian argument is definitely in favour of abortion.

        I‚Äôll argue the timeline of things like abortion, feminism, gay marriage, Buckleyite conservatism, neoconservatism, etc., point to the cause being something other than pure Yankeedom, but I‚Äôll grant that the Puritan ethic was the exploitable weak spot in the ruling class. I agree with Falcone that there‚Äôs a larger war on patriarchal, northern-European cultures, of which Yankeedom is an example. Perhaps WWII was a larger cataclysm than the history books say.
I‚Äôll also say if conservatives manage to overturn Roe, it would be like Darth Vader throwing Palpatine down the reactor shaft.

        The abortion thing is just theater for the Progs. They are loving this whole episode. They need it to rally for the Midterms (to the extent that they cannot openly cheat in certain jurisdictions without big cities).
They could have easily passed a law on Roe/Wade during the Obama or Clinton Admins. Why didn‚Äôt they? So they could have an evergreen campaign issue. That‚Äôs what this whole thing is about.
Abortion is to the Progs what gun rights are to the Right: Just a source of exploitable angst. Nothing is really going to change on either issue.

            Oh God you‚Äôre rightThis will be their rallying point for the mid termsThey will going off about it full crazy like they did with trying to get rid of orange man.  Non stop wailing and screaming until next November.Or maybe not?   Speaking of the normal women nit the ones in the media.  Maybe their inner morality takes over and they come to realize abortion was wrong all along and they quietly accept the new restrictions put on it?We can‚Äôt forget women like to be told what to do.  Just give them direction so they can put their energies into it and be happy.  This may turn out good for our women.   I‚Äôm an eternal optimist.

        If Roe dies, then Covid killed it. If you all haven‚Äôt been whipping out ‚ÄúMy body, my choice!‚Äù on every single Karen in your life at every single opportunity in re: the vax, then I want you to imagine Great Thunberg scolding a human face, forever: ‚ÄúHow dare you!

                Which is absolutely the best possible outcome, long term.

            Already literally, not figuratively, used it on a vinegar faced scold of a Karen who had cornered my wife‚Äôs poor cousin at a party we were at. She was haranguing him on his vaccination status (he‚Äôs against and isn‚Äôt vaccinated) and when I walked past to get to the fridge to get a beer she demanded of me ‚ÄúHow about YOU? Are you vaccinated?!?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
Her: ‚ÄúWhy not?!?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúHey, My Body, My Choice.‚Äù
And I walked right past her and got my beer. The look on her face was priceless.

            Can‚Äôt ignore the power of the gynocracy. The black robes may squirm over the body sovereignty issue vis a vis covid, but there is plenty of precedent establishing that the individual female body is sacred while the individual male body is a mere part of the collective in which corollary rights are granted only as a function of utility, what is good for society.What flows from the singular sovereign female is not just her ‚Äúright‚Äù to murder her unborn baby, but also includes things like male genital mutilation, fatherhood as a put option of financial support, and unilateral determinations of paternity. Not only are there no male corollaries to abortion but male productivity has long been a legal slave to female desire. And if all we own is our body and our labors, well the gynocracy has had a lien on that for a long time.Even so, I do use the ‚Äúmy body, my choice‚Äù because it still strikes at Karens dusty womb. Which seems to be what what drives most of her politics: her lady parts and open borders. Interesting.During these heated election seasons (which now seems to be perpetual) I have also been known to ask the more rabid of strong independent womyn: ‚Äúwhat does it say about a culture in which the greatest political concerns of its women are consequence free sex and the unmitigated ‚Äúright‚Äù to terminate pregnancies?‚Äù Well I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs not a culture long for this world. It‚Äôs a death cult, after all.

                Exactly so. ‚ÄúMy body, my choice‚Äù isn‚Äôt intended toconverta Covidiot. Those people are beyond help. It‚Äôs to slip one past everyone else‚Äôs defenses.

            One or the other? Surely you know by now that there is no end to the absurdity that a Federal Justice can perform mental gymnastics on. I think the only thing that can come from this in our favor is that it is passed back to the States, where it belonged in 1970, with no Federal involvement. This means that blue States will keep it. As long as there are blue States available that can provide abortion, Karen can get one. The drawback to that is that Shanequa will be discriminated against because she doesn‚Äôt have a car, a chauffeur, and a per diem while on the road obtaining her abortion. So, the federal gov will give her an Obamamobile. Whitey gets to pay for it because of racism. Or, Shanequa will be too lazy, just stay in her gated community, squeeze out another Astrophysicist, and keep the Obamamobile.

        American women will not accept any restrictions on their sexuality, including abortion.  This is not the case with men.Example:  Man lies about wearing ‚Äúprotection‚Äù, he‚Äôs paying for a conceived child and possibly going to prison.Woman lies about using birth control and conceives:  the man is on the hook for 18 years of child care.Another example:  Consensual whoopie takes place.  1-5-10-20 years later, regret takes place.  Women ‚Äúhave a case‚Äù base on their word alone, and the bias is towards her being  reasonable and the man being a pig (or worse).The Big Lie both sexes have embraced:  Sex is no big deal and is 99% fun and games, instead of an activity that has huge emotional pull, long term consequences, and family formation is just an afterthought.

        For most of human history, infant mortality was very high and evolution reinforced traits that maximized fecundity in order to offset that deficit. Even within the era of civilization, a lot of man-made innovations were geared toward to improving birth survival and encouraging large families. Traditional marriage and patriarchy are examples.Over time, the unit of civilization jumped from village to town to city to state to nation (and now global), and the distance between rulers and the ruled increased exponentially. This increased distance is why the cloud people have no connection to the bottom of the social pyramid. George H. W. Bush famously did not know the price of a gallon of milk.This root problem is not going to be solved by anything involving the abortion debate or related public policy. We are not going to fuck our way out of the mess we‚Äôre in. The root problem is that we are being led by people who have no business leading anything; or more accurately, people exercising power as an imitation of leading. Aborting an innocent fetus is heinously immoral. Aborting a tyrant is the highest virtue.

        I can‚Äôt speak for non whites, but I don‚Äôt see how a white girl can kill her baby.  Outside of a few crazies, we are talking regular people.  How can she be okay with having some instrument inserted up her canal to mangle the poor thing‚Äôs skull like cracking a crab.   It‚Äôs just hideous and horrible.My stomach is turning just thinking about it.  I suppose she is able to suppress her feelings and emotions, hiding them behind the fact that society says it‚Äôs great what she did and no worries, in fact you did great. Have a lollipopIn the end I don‚Äôt see how this inner conflict hasn‚Äôt royally messed up every white woman who has ever had an abortion.  If I‚Äôm a guy and it makes me sick, just imagine what they‚Äôre going through as what could have been moms.  Loving and protecting moms.  All those deep seated maternal feelings and instincts just taken and crushed.And since I am feeling this way I know other guys who were party to it are feeling sick about it deep down.This abortion thing has ruined our people.  So much of the collapse of morality is tied to it.

            There was a video posted yesterday of three women after some hysterical chanting taking what they claimed was the morning after pill outside the Supreme Court building.  My wife had a miscarriage and I know how hard that was on her physically as well as emotionally.  Why would any woman want to do that as a part of some bizarre performance art protest?  In saner time I would assume they took a Tylenol or something else, but now, who knows?

                I have my theories on this, and I‚Äôve articulated them before
But in summary, these women doing these abortion protests / performance art, they are insane undoubtedly because they have had abortions before and it has made them so ‚Äî insofar as a child is an appendage to the mother, abortion is a form of suicide or self mutilation.  It‚Äôs self perpetuating.  Crazy means no guy will want them so they don‚Äôt pass on their suicidal and self-mutilating instincts to the next and crazy because deep down they know they have wronged and this is their way of masking it.

                    Falcone,
I suspect you‚Äôre right: a good number of those ladies protesting in favor of abortion have themsrlves had one (or more), and are attempting to justify it, and assuage their guilt about it‚Äî- by the strength of their ‚Äúprotest‚Äù.
I‚Äôve known more than one woman who was assured that having an abortion was no big deal, and only in the aftermath‚Äî when their ‚Äúabortion counselors‚Äù were long gone‚Äî- did the full truth of what they‚Äôd done sink in.

            It‚Äôs the only medical procedure the doctor‚Äôs not allowed to explain.  If you had tennis elbow, they‚Äôd tell you all about what‚Äôs to happen.Well, that and the vax, now.This is wrecking our ladies‚Äô minds, as if the considerations for them haven‚Äôt always been truly serious enough.  We each owe our first breath to a woman who wrestled with Death himself that we might take it.  On the other hand, the sewers behind Roman whorehouses were filled with the infant bones of customers‚Äô bastards.Norplant and RU-486 as a compromise.  I‚Äôll take a tradeoff.Why?Overpopulation and resource limits, for one, since Nature‚Äôs correction of the stray cat problem is so dire.But on a purely religious note, I don‚Äôt go by faith.  The evidence says we are feeding a Something.Animal and human sacrifice were not symbolic.  The electrical surcharge of distressed nervous systems- fear, agony, death- are a gradient, a food source, for that Something.Thus those Infected are its promoters and practitioners.  The agony of the innocents must end, yet we can‚Äôt have Erectus females popping out 20 aspiring carjackers either.That too will lead to the terrible Harvest of Souls in the inevitable conflagration.  We must listen to the women, and give them a compromise.

            at the Midwestern state university i went to in the early 80‚Äôs I had a friend who was an RA in the gigantic dorm I lived in. His main job was telling people to turn the music off/down after 9:00pm and referring the girls on the floor the to ‚Äúpregnancy counseling center‚Äù.one of the training documents he got when orienting for the job said that on average 25% of the coeds got pregnant in their freshman year at school.  at that time the school was 90% white. clear we were a debauched people even then .

        I know you‚Äôre not big on teleologies, but ain‚Äôt it a kick for already sore balls that just when America is going majority-minority, it looks like we‚Äôre going to get our first pro-natal policy in forever? Someone, I forget who, once said something like, ‚ÄúNothing ever goes completely right without a plan, but nothing ever goes completely wrong without a plan, either.‚ÄùIf the law breaks state by state, then that means travel expenses will be as much a part of the cost of abortion as the actual process. And because whites still have higher mean wealth, that means white girls will still be getting abortions.If, as you‚Äôve said, morals are something you invent after you win to lock in your gains, then there is something to be said for the Margaret Sanger school of eugenics. Of course, mainstream conservatives would never take that position, because only Nazis would be eugenicists.

        Abortion is murder, but this is war. If Roe is overturned, blue states will legalize infinity-month abortion and maintain status qou mort.
Red states will overflow with black people. As usual, Republicans (and the bad whites) will subsidize their own destruction.
Its far better for abortion to be available to all, but more importantly our enemies. But even more importantly it should be unthinkable to our people.

            If you think red states won‚Äôt immediately pass similar pro-abortion laws, you don‚Äôt understand the rot in the US.
Ask any hard corps bible thumping woman if she thinks women should be jailed for a 3rd trimester abortion, and she‚Äôll look at you like you‚Äôre a monster.
It‚Äôs the same female mentality that leads juries to acquit women who‚Äôve murdered their live children: ‚Äútheir suffering was enough of a punishment.‚Äù

I actually support women getting lighter sentences than men (though killing their children would still be execution).  That being said, in return they should get fewer political rights.  This used to be the general social contract that worked fine until ‚Äòmuh equality got in the way.

            Overturning a decision that was based on the right to privacy might not have been bad in 1975 or 1980. But today, we have an entirely different country, and entirely different population, and an entirely different government. So I hope they don‚Äôt overturn it.
ZMan has put his finger on the salient point. If they do overturn Roe, we shall ALL of us live naked in front of some pretty horrible creatures. It is no longer 1975.

            Tykebomb:  Very well said.  THIS IS WAR.  Every war involves dehumanizing one‚Äôs enemies because otherwise killing mangles the soul of the White forced to kill.  And in truth, I do not regard certain races as fully human, by any biological or cultural definition.  Abortion is unquestionably slaughtering a tiny life.  It‚Äôs something a civilized people ought to find abhorrent.But I don‚Äôt look at the latest black criminal du jour and think of a black baby ‚Äì quite the opposite.  I look at a black baby and see all the crime and pain and mayhem he‚Äôs going to cause as he grows up.  He is destruction and White despair in microcosm, and I will not mourn his ending at any time.

                    3G and Falcone have precisely stated my sentiment regarding abortion and negro lives.  Every white abortion is a tragedy.  Every negro abortion is one less future felon or parasite harming my people. The negro truly is the Untermensch.  I am utterly unmoved when I read about the daily carnage within negro communities.  All I ever think is that as long as the violence and dysfunction is confined to victimizing each other, have at it.

        Regardless of finitudes of the short term, I cannot imagine that the same chicanery that legalized gay marriage by invalidating Prop 8 will not work out in a similar fashion. I do not even believe the oft threatened court packing (in the true sense of that word) is necessary. I believe that, if they invalidate Roe, there will be a variety of laws that will be passed over the years that will eventually result in the complete legalization of abortion outside of anything vague like trimesters or heartbeats ‚Äì it will get vaguer and more broadly able to be applied.To wit: the invalidation of Roe will not terminate abortions (har har), it will lead to a new metric for allowing it in the coming years. That legislation will categorize abortion as a health issue relegated to doctor‚Äôs judgment of health. Thus, if the ‚Äòfetus‚Äô (even after being born) is a threat to the mother‚Äôs health (e.g. mental ‚Äì for that can contain anything), then you can terminate the (un)born child. And there are plenty of doctors slobbering at the mouth for this Angel of Death power.No proof of course (there never is when prognosticating), but my gut feeling is strong on this one, and I really think that a short term invalidation of Roe is quite possible, but that the long term effect will be complete carte blanche abortion ‚Äòfreedoms.‚Äô

            You‚Äôre probably rightThere is no way the likes of robert‚Äôs and kav and probably gorsuch are going to take a huge moral stand.  They will invalidate the law on some technicality while introducing other metrics that pretty much result in some half baked scheme with loopholes.  So nothing really changes on the ground.  But they stood up for states rights, it will be said by the talk show hosts and con inc.   Trump will take a victory lap and fart out his mouth about how great he is, and they will act like this was some huge win, while the left will scream about it but soon realize the thing is a Swiss cheese decision with lots of holes and get busy finding workarounds with their army of attorneys.

        I dunno, I don‚Äôt see the correlation between Boomer and Gen-X women beyond childbearing years and the collapse of Roe. Unless the Supreme Court is full of wise abuelas latinas and old Black Baptists which it isn‚Äôt. Hispanics are still a minority, and progressive leftism is still in firm control of the institutions.I suppose there is still an element of anti-abortion Christianity among the ruling class, a holdover from the 1990s, from which my cucky state senator was crowing about on radio this morning. The only thing I see driving the abortion issue in Texas and in the Supreme Court is the decades-long struggle from a dedicated minority to overturn Roe is coming to fruition. This is similar to the relaxation of gun laws in some states which have been passed against powerful progressive lobbies. So, instead of broad demographic trends, I see rather the success of a bloody-minded interest group.

            ‚ÄúPro-life‚Äù in its original form was known as ‚Äúboob bait for Bubba.‚Äù It was the classic Con, Inc., grift. The reality is abortion now will shift to the states and localities. This was always the case. Again, it would have been even more of a demographic catastrophe if abortion had not been widely available.
Frankly, forcible abortion among certain populations would be a good thing although that is not happening, either.

                Sidvic and Marko are talking about ending the ‚ÄòJewels in the Crown‚Äô industry.A brother, serving as a public health officer in Dallas, said often a black ‚Äúaunt‚Äù would bring in a 13 or 14 y.o. ‚Äúniece‚Äù and declare, ‚Äúthe breeder says she ain‚Äôt takin‚Äô, and we wanta know why.‚ÄùThe breeder is the male.  He doesn‚Äôt need a house, or a job, he lives with a batch of females until they get another income stream, then he is passed on to another house where they take care of him for his services.This is why the most prolific father in America is an unemployed black man with 43 children.  Who says this race of lions ain‚Äôt smart?

        Maine Senator Susan Collins is going to help the Democrats pass a bill making Roe the law of the land.  This bill would also clearly be unconstitutional, but the Court would most likely let it go.  This article also states in her meeting with Kavanaugh before voting to confirm him, he agreed to fink on conservatives when this issue came before the court.  It would be hilarious if he was lying to her.

        When the Supreme Court likely boots the issue back to states, you‚Äôre going to see crazy states like New York double down on abortion services, and the red states will clamp down, but there will likely be some economic warfare among the woke corporation trying to bring them to heel.  It will be a harder sell, though, for the NCAA to try and strong-arm Alabama into accepting abortion.The odd part of abortion is it‚Äôs a liberal white woman‚Äôs pet cause, but the people who use abortion like birth control is black women.  Likely, even in red states, there are going to be sleazy districts where the law looks the other way.  It‚Äôs still a win though, as it makes clear abortion compatible with civilized society.

        ‚Äù A politics and culture dependent on middle-class white people is not long for the work if middle-class white people are throwing their babies in the dumpster of abortion mills. Abortion was a self-inflicted gunshot to the womb of heritage America.‚ÄùI could not disagree more.Abortion was a stay of execution to Heritage America. More than half of all black babies in NYC, for example, are aborted. Granted, this will continue there post-Roe as abortion clinics spring up all around the Big Apple, guarded by decrepit Tribal women and Antifa. Some demographers think blacks would compose more than one-fourth of the nation‚Äôs population if abortion had not been available to them.Increasingly, Hispanic women also abort their babies. Again, this is a good thing.One thing abortion is not is a White thing. The undulating harpies of White BLM do not have sex with White men, for the most part, and the lower class Whites do not have abortion due to religious and ethical principles.A nation that can force some fat Shanika to whelp out a future criminal can hold you down and inject vaccines in your arm. Maybe Con, Inc., can grift off that for a while.

            With as many odd looks I get, this is why I believe to be truly pro-life, you need ruthless social controls to ensure people either genetically or culturally unfit for society get removed from the general population, and this includes rigorous use of the death penalty, not only for violence, but a wide swath of pathological and degenerate behavior.

                That would be reasonable, but of course we know the reality of which groups would not be targeted and which one would be.
Looking at recent charts, more than half of black pregnancies are terminated and roughly a fourth of Hispanic pregnancies. White abortion rates are roughly one-tenth and God only knows how many of those were due to mudsharking. ‚ÄúOther,‚Äù which mostly means Asians, abort at a rate of 20 percent.

                The statistics do not bear out abortion anathemized White family formation. Quite the opposite, really. Without abortion we would have been a minority almost a generation ago. Abortion did prevent non-White family formation to a great degree.
What did anathemize White family formation was economics and women in the workplace.

                    Joe G, you are not looking at the correct time.  Boomer women (now 30+ years out from fertility) aborted tens of millions of white babies in the late 70s and 80s.  Those tens of millions would be having scores of millions of white grandkids today.  What the groups in AINO are doing in Current Year does not address THAT issue, which was finalized decades ago.  Current year‚Äôs demographics, fertility, and abortion will not be felt for another 20 years‚Ä¶ A lot can happen in the 30‚Äôs.

                        unless of course the white women get pregnant again, which almost all of them did.  keep in mind a women is only going to raise a fixed number (in her mind, they all know how many they want, before they have any) of kids overall.  so if she aborts one pregnancy, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean an overall loss of a white person.

            Increasingly, Hispanic women also abort their babies.
Got any real numbers on that?
Hispanics, whoever that is, and other ethnicities world-wide, regard the US as the epicenter of evil simply because of its tacit acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control. All of the most obnoxious characteristics of the 50s and 60s Soviet Union are now a normal feature of life under the star-spangled banner, abortion, universal day-care, unlimited government propaganda, education as indoctrination, and so on. Tom Sunic describes it well in his ‚ÄúHomo Americanus: Child of the Post-modern Age‚Äù.

                    I found another one by state, but almost half of them were not reporting data, so it didn‚Äôt seem that valuable.  Interesting that the number of total abortions has been steadily going down since 1990 especially among white women.  Could this possibly be a sign feminism is on the wane among women of child bearing age?  Combined with the total fertility rate is it possibly a sign that hormonal birth control has worked a little too well?  A lot of women can‚Äôt even get pregnant when they want to.

                        Hypothetical abortion always was a Huwhite women thing. Literal abortions always were a black thing. It is good to see the numbers of Hispanic abortions rising. I would encourage handing out maps at the southern border to abortion clinics throughout the United States.

                        I suspect the abortions are down because the contraception use is up.  They have sex education in grade school now.  Free clinics distribute all needed in most locals.  Parental consent not required.
If folks were deciding not to abort, but rather to have children, fertility and birth stat‚Äôs would be up.  But for Whites, are we seeing this?

                            You also have a flood of polylactic options for middle-class white women. When I get my meds, there is a store length aisle of the stuff. That is why the TFR for whites is 1.6. Blacks are down to 1.8, but their poor impulse control leads to more abortions.

                        Maybe I‚Äôm not following you re ‚Äúadjust for age‚Äù or maybe I‚Äôm not reading the stats correctly. The charts I am seeing break down into live births vs. abortions.  Whites are the outlier in those by a ratio of slightly less than 10 to 1, having one abortion for roughly every ten births. Blacks have (as of 2018) one abortion to every two live births. Hispanics have one abortion for every five births.

                            I misunderstood your point. I‚Äôll concede that you can make an argument that abortion is now more common with nonwhites, but age is one factor. I‚Äôd bet in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs white numbers were higher. Regardless, abortion politics has never been about blacks or Hispanics. It is about middle-class white women. That is the salient point. Now that we are running out of middle-class white women of child bearing years, the issue is waning.

                            Let‚Äôs not miss the forest for the trees. The point I made in the post is that abortion was driven by middle-class white women of child bearing years. Now that we are running out of middle-class white women of child bearing years, the issue is waning.For the spergs, consider that the typical white woman in America is 57 and the typical black woman is 27. Clearly, abortion is a very different thing between the two groups and that will make comparing the numbers less useful. White women may be killing fewer of their babies now, but the horse left the barn a long time ago.

                        I wear my sperg badge with pride haha. Anyway , point taken but it suggests a chain of causality for social policy that includes public will influencing enacted law or edicts. i.e. boomer women of child bearing age made 50 + 1 in favor of baby killing but now they don‚Äôt make up 50 + 1 so the policy is vulnerable. I‚Äôm not as confident as I used to be that the chain runs that way anymore and if the Supreme Overlords of Law do indeed overturn Roe I will assume it is because whoever has the pictures of Roberts at Epstein‚Äôs Island wants it that way.

            I think the pro-choice movement and its ancestor, the birth control pill, were definitely driven by huwhite feminists. But abortion itself is not a white thing. I think white girls take the Pill or at worst the Morning After Pill, and white men are probably the only people that buy condoms. But most non-white girls go straight for the clinic.

                    I agree to an extent, but white women of child bearing age are still outnumber blacks.  They are most likely having less sex in general and are far more likely to be using birth control.  I wonder if younger generations of white women are more likely to keep the baby when they do have unexpected pregnancies too.  The drop off in number of abortions from 1990 to 2017 among white women is about more than the population decline among women of child bearing age.

                    Zman:  Valid point.  And those same White women who marched for abortion and ensured their daughters got the pill as soon as they reached puberty have simultaneously agitated for the ‚Äòrights‚Äô of non-White children.  To wit, the right of non-White children to be fed and educated and provided for by White people‚Äôs labor and at the cost of White people‚Äôs own families.Older White women will bleat about Roe vs. Wade but cry crocodile tears over dead brown children on a beach.  At least a lot of us here are honest that we ultimately don‚Äôt care about those brown children ‚Äì White children are our sole priority.  Morality is for one‚Äôs own people, not one‚Äôs enemies, who have no morality towards anyone and rejoice in our pain, degradation, and death.

                        ‚ÄúOlder White women will bleat about Roe vs. Wade but cry crocodile tears over dead brown children on a beach.‚ÄùThis. I‚Äôm interested enough by this thread to go look and see if there are stats available that show abortions vs. live births by race for the Seventies/Eighties. I may be wrong, but my guess is abortion has been a black thing, thus a good thing, since Roe. It certainly is a black and increasingly Hispanic thing, thus a good thing, now.The suggestions that birth control may account for the low rate of White abortions very well may be true, as an aside, but that raises the question of how many mulattos were avoided given the proclivities of Upper Middle Class White women who force birth control on their daughters.Further, these same White women who bleat about (not enough) dead brown children on the beaches cheer the castrations of their people‚Äôs boys.

            Yeah but they‚Äôd die anyway if not aborted.  They‚Äôd just end up getting shot or thrown in jail etc
Blacks have a self destruct button built in.   Their mortality is just naturally always going to be way ahead of ours.  That‚Äôs who they are.  They just die a lot and die younger.
Yes, it‚Äôs good that many are aborted because it limits the war zones in the cities,   Imagine if there were millions more of them shooting each other and dying on the pavement.
Yeah so you are probably right. It‚Äôs better for us.

            Jack D: That‚Äôs not a reasonable take; you are using ceteris paribus pathologicly. Yes, society would be different if society‚Äôs makeup was fundamentally different.  But the idea that there wouldnt have been a response to that drastic change is just nonsense. What would have happened if abortion and jailing males hadn‚Äôt stemmed the tide of the crack epidemic? Would we have gotten our own apartheid system instead, as the urban violence became too much? Who knows?It‚Äôs the problem with ahistorical whatiffery, ‚ÄúWhat if Caesar went to the bathroom instead of walking into the conspiracy‚Äôs ambush‚Äù thing.  That is the realm of pure speculation, free of any ties to actual reality.

        ‚ÄúThis could be a read as an acknowledgment by the court that the concept of privacy is now dead. All of us should expect to live naked in full view of everyone.

            Stop aborting fetuses to mandate a jab created by aborting fetuses?Peak clown.   Will allow.
One of the our-guy takes on abortion is that it keeps a lid on the particularly otherwise fecund 13% of our population, relative to the Karen careergirls and their libertine daughters.    It‚Äôs hard to argue, based on countries where they make 100% of the population.

                That take‚Äôs not original to our side and in past times was rather openly cited as a reason violent crime was on a general downward trend. Sociologists used to tangle themselves into pretzels to make up for the fact black-on-black murder wasn‚Äôt keeping up with birthrates, yet the black population was numerically declining.
