        Hmm… either:
Feds too stupid to cleverly intercept electronic communications without the plebes finding out; or
Feds quite good at it but prefer to promote the first explanation as a way of keeping the plebes from looking too closely at their activities.  Look! A squirrel!

        The existence of a secret court that issues secret opinions and rulings is so offensive to me that I hope there’s a special painful place in Hell reserved for the judges who serve on the FISA court. And that goes doubly for John Roberts, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, oversees this unConstitutional monstrosity.  If there was ever any question whether the Federal courts can be relied upon to protect the rights and liberty of individuals, what we know now about the FISA court settles it. To my mind, the country would be better off if the Federal court system were abolished with the repeal of Article III of the Constitution and all legal matters were then left to the state courts to decide.  I cannot believe America would be any worse off than we are now.
