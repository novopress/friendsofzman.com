        When I was young, I had a lot of black friends. All the white kids did, and we all got along famously. Why shouldn’t we? We were all immature, irresponsible, and ignorant, and we reveled in it. Who wanted to grow up, when being a kid was so much fun? And black culture was so much fun because even the adults were immature, irresponsible, and ignorant. No demands, no expectations, no self-control. Just the gratification of the moment. It was bliss.That’s why popular culture, which is pitched to children, has been entirely taken over by blacks: who knows better how to behave untethered to any sort of standard? And that’s why each succeeding generation truly has been getting worse and worse and worse. We were worse than my father’s generation; our kids were worse than us; the latest crop is practically worthless.Haley’s advice comes at least a half-century too late. The people those athletes should be emulating are mostly dead.

            It’s been forty years since Alex Karras said he wished that the players scoring a touchdown would act like they had been there before.

            Ties.   Getting up in the morning and putting on a tie for school.  That was serious, after school the tie could come off and then that was playtime.There’s no division today.  Read a comment yesterday above a guy that was advancing in some online video game and the game was automatically updating his co-workers on his progress as he played.  During the day, at work.   One of those on the update list was his boss who apparently just shrugged and ignored it.   It was too much trouble to try and get him to stop, way too much trouble to initiate procedures to suspend or fire him and besides he did less damage during the day if he was playing games. Or sleeping.I wonder, when does that “What can’t go on for long, won’t go on.” kick in?No, it’s not just the blacks anymore.  The signs of the primitive are all around us; tats and piercings and hooker clothing in schools.  Anyone here ever read “The Marching Morons”?

        Well, it is not like we white guys can tell anyone about anything.  We have the combo of white privilege and male privilege, so anything we say is either condescending, patronizing, sexist, racist, or discriminatory, unless it applies exclusively to other hetero white males.  So we shut up, and quietly look out for our loved ones and friends.  Or if is one’s cup of tea, one can go the overt progressive women power/minority power route, do the street rallies and such.  Except that the women and people of color are secretly looking at you like you are some sort of creepy freak.  But they will generally be polite about it, in deference to shared stated values.
