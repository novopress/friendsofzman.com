        Excellent piece.  The day after the election I texted a friend that Scott Walker was the big story of the election (along with the shocker in VA).  Barring any surprises, Walker will be the GOP nominee in 2016, and probably the President.Scott Brown is a dope.  He made immigration his central issue, which is not a major concern in the Granite State.  New Hampshire is not MA.  If you run as a conservative you better be a conservative.  As Lowin points out, guns are a big deal.  So is the economy.  NH is a state that will respond well to a libertarian-slanted conservative candidate, and Brown wasn’t even close.In Maryland, I think immigration was a serious issue, to the Democrats’ detriment.  The Democrat power structure in Maryland was practically begging the Children’s crusaders to settle there.  I don’t think that sat well with middle-class voters, particularly African-Americans, who recognize a real threat when they see one.  This is something the GOP should pay attention to.  Divide and conquer.  Interestingly, a vitriolic Chris Matthews was the only pundit, on the left or on the right, who correctly recognized that immigration was a disaster issue for the Democrats on Tuesday, and will continue to be so.

        To be fair, Walker has also been helped by the opponents the left have chosen to run against him.  Not that they have a great pool of non-batshit talent to choose from, but they’ve picked some real losers lately.
I can only hope they decide that their candidates suffer from *not* being ‘out there like freaking pluto’ crazy enough.

        Brown had an additional problem that’s being ignored — gun control. Before he moved into NH, he was on record as supporting do nothing anti gun legislation. Apparently being a slow learner, he was protested by the Gun Owners of NH crowd in the lead up to the primaries, then he refused to answer questions in a NH firearms coalition townhall, didn’t bother responding to the NRA questionnaire (Brown’s NRA rating is ?). He voted with obama 70+% when he was a Mass senator, so there wasn’t a lot of difference between the two. Corrupt as she is, shaheen has been quiet about gun control. There’s a precedent for this single issue, the last congressclown, dick swett, who voted for Clinton’s AWB was turned out the next year. NH is not massachusetts, politicians ignore that at their own peril. NH, VT and ME are still second amendment friendly outposts in the moonbat northeast

        Scott Brown will not be looking for work very long. If he isn’t already there, he’ll be back at Fox within two months. If I’m wrong, pretend I didn’t post this, please, because I will.

        Brown was not helped by the fact the governors race was poorly fought. The people running the New Hampshire GOP are incompetent. They can handle the small stuff, but they get clobbered by the pros the Democrats bring in for the big races.
As far as the Left, they have been a part of the Democratic Party since Wilson. What’s different now is they are the party. All the other guys fled. Ideological parties either expand or contract, just like the mass movements upon which they are built.

        I don’t think Liberalism ate itself so much as it consumed the Democrat Party. Once upon a time in America, there was a significant percentage of Democrats who today would have passed as mainstream Republicans. Then the Leftists infected the party like a virus, just as Leftism has infected nearly every institution in the nation.“Brown had nothing to sell.” True, because he is not a conservative, which is what we were looking for here in New Hampshire. He’s a nice enough guy, (I’ve met him and his wife), but I voted for Brown as a dissent against Shaheen. I’m sure that a lot of Republicans just skipped that race on the ballot, but I’m just guessing.
