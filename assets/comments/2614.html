        And, oh, by the way Elizabeth Warren has a personel fortune of something around $14 million. She’s been busy selling faux tommyhawks and feathered headresses.

        It is well established that human nature being what it is, given a choice, most people would choose to be an equal in a state of relative poverty than to be unequal even in a state of relative personal wealth. Tocqueville believed that the virus of equality finds more fertile ground in the democratic mind than in any other.

        The duality of nature and of human existence, starting with life/death, is what make’s life life. We only know we are alive because we know we are going to die. We are only joyful because we have experienced sorrow. And so on. Rich/poor, good/bad, tragedy/comedy have always been and will always be with us. To wish them away is to wish for the end of life. I don’t know what drives liberals, maybe they hate life. To me, they’re toxic. I just try to stay away from them.

        You cannot help someone by doing for them that which they should do for themselves.  The evidence that this is true is there for all to see.  Imagine how much better off some inner city welfare mother with three kids and no husband would be if we never subsidized that activity.  She may have choosen to work towards a career or she may have choosen love and a long term relationship.  But instead she choose to get pregnant three times by three different men so that the welfare system would take care of her needs and her children so she could spend her days in a drug addled stupor.  I can’t help but believe that the progressives of the 60’s and later knew this all along.

        Point 3.  They never talk about people being able to create their own jobs, because regulations seem to be gospel to liberals.
Regulations keep the employee an employee.
I love this post. I have found liberals to be voluntarily stingy, and the reason they like taxes to help the poor is because everyone gets hit, and they don’t actually have to help the poor, nor get to know them. The poor are not all saints as you’ve said.
