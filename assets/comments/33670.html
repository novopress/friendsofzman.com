        For someone with a spare $5 million lying around, it’s hard to imagine what US citizenship can give them that they don’t already have or can’t already get.

            US citizenship is a contract that binds our descendants to be ruled by the immigrant arriviste’s. $5M’s not a bad deal for them.
And if you have that much money, you don’t count your money (except in an obsessive toilet-brained way). You just get what you want.

        A picture is coming into focus. Various high profile Democrats met with the Ukrainian dictator to encourage him to sabotage the first step towards a negotiated peace. Afterwards, the dictator flies off to London to be received and feted by the gathered and waiting Eurocrat authoritarians. The deliberate sabotage of the duly elected executive’s diplomatic initiative by members of congress in concert with foreign political rulers is seditious and the participants are traitors. It does not matter if their motivation is the personal financial gain they have been realizing from the war or actual ideologically driven bloodlust for Russian Christians. Perhaps the time is not quite right to take the straight forward steps usually called for when dealing with sedition and treason but I’d at least like to see the administration publicly state a summary of what is going on and establish the moral frame for the actions that are going to be required soon.

        In regards to foreign affairs, Trump maneuvered to get the EU wankers to pick up the slack after he’s begun cutting off the US hose of circular money laundering through Ukraine.  I’m listening to “Europe reacts to the Trump-Zelensky rowe” clips right now.

        The proposed Gold Card is a terrible idea, as is the current EB-5 visa. The latter should be scrapped, along with the EB-1, EB-2, EB-3 and ED-4 visas. They are all total scams, pushed by the Open Borders lobby.
I am grateful to the author for his explanation in Section-5 above. However, I wouldn’t give even a C- mark to this Gold Card. I would give it an F. We don’t needanymore immigrants. The new Director of ICE, Tom Homan, has the right attitude.

            If I were to paint selling out the country in a positive light, I’d say Trump’s getting the rich on board as a sanctuary state. If you don’t buy in, you could be sanctioned in the future. (Financial warfare instead of MIC weapons credits.)Still, better to sell it to the money than give it away to foreign troops.Further, better to have the wealthy elite of foreign countries wooing us as concubines for royal marriage; those ties of obligation will provide quite a bit of cushion rather than the old model of sending in the IMF or the Marines.You could say it’s about recognizing the world as it is, increasingly multicultural and globalist, rather than how we might want it to be, more homogeneously nationalist.

                Item.
The correct perspective is to see the glass as half-full (of poison).
Quotatum:
You could say it’s about recognizing the world as it is, increasingly multicultural and globalist
End quotatum finitum.
You could say it’s increasingly rootless and cosmopolitan.
