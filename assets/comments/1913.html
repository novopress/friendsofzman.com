        Good point about cigarettes.  Though I enjoyed them I smoked them for far too long.  I am no fan of the shaming of smokers these days, though it may be somewhat effective in its curtailment.  Interesting that there is little or no shaming of pot smokers.  Seems like it is due.
I do enjoy a good cigar, and wish the heads out there knew what a wonderful thing a Perdomo or an A Fuente Gran Reserva can be.  I am sure they have a medicinal benefit as well.

        Yes, it’s the unintended / unknown consequences of legalization that might prove to be a problem. What will the criminal element turn to when there’s no money in pot, and what will the drug enforcement types be doing with their new found free time?
