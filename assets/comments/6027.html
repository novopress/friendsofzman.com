        I get the feeling that America’s Black Swan is very soon on its way. Not Trump necessarily and I am not sure what form it will take, but when it does arrive it will prompt a whole lot of “well duh!” responses.

        “There’s no sign of Ribbonism or Whiteboyism breaking out in America, but who knows what tomorrow will bring.”
Give it another election cycle.
In the wake of the omnibus budget bill, Limbaugh calls the actions of the GOP “worse than a betrayal” and more or less calls for the party to be disbanded:

        “How else can you interpret such an outrageous betrayal?”Could it be Ryan isknowinglyplaying the part of the bed pan that catches the festering Big Gov/Critical Theory turd that America is finally, finally voiding?The country has been constipated for some decades now.  We started to get some movement back in 2009-2010 with the application of the Tea Party emollients.  And now, almost seven years older and with Trump surging, we’re prairie-doggin’ for sure.Call me the eternal optimist, but one must trust that the political class has a portable waste container ready to catch the noxious exudent and to transport it to the appropriate toxic waste facility.  Ryan is oleaginous enough to serve and he certainly is portable.(And just look at that face.  Maybe he grew a beard just to signal he was about to “get dirty.)That is the one and only alternative explanation I can hatch for Ryan’s phenomenal tone deafness.  No more exist.  So if you disqualify this option, please know that all that’s left is “outrageous betrayal.”And that is a bitter pill to swallow.

            Oh, the betrayal is real. But, from their point of view, it’s not a betrayal. They are parents making hard decisions for children.

        The disconnect is to the point the establishment can’t even insult people properly, like when they call out Trumps ideas as mere common sense, thinking this would color him in a negative light. Because common sense is of course beneath us, who would fall for that? They truly don’t realize that every insult they throw at him makes the Donald only look better from the perspective of a normal person, and saves him personally ad money on top of that!
Temporarily deny entry to muslims, what a crazy idea, what’s next, shutting off the main when there’s a gas leak?

        You forget the influence of mercantilism. The Brits preferred to export wheat and barley for cash (gold) and effectively banned (Corn Laws) the importation of cheap crops because imports are a drain on the nation’s balance sheet. Ironically this would blow up in their faces 50 years later when the free traders split the Tory party and caused the failure of the Irish Home Rule movement.

            No, I forgot nothing. Peel tried to repeal the Corn Laws, but was stymied in Parliament. He then went around them by importing American corn. The Irish Famine was a political consequence as much as a biological consequence. That political dynamic could only happen when the ruling class was divorced completely from the people over whom they were ruling.

        You’ve pretty much nailed it.I’m left stunned by the budget deal. Have these people not been watching what has been happening in primary politics? Are they really that divorced from voters that they can do this stuff and think it won’t matter to anyone? Or do they just assume that their voters don’t matter and can just stuff it?I think we are seeing something like a French aristocracy before the revolution. Our leaders live in such an alternate reality that the bursting dam is going to come as quite the surprise to them. If it comes along with a financial break, lord help us all…Tim

        Angela Merkel said recently that Multiculturalism is a sham and that the one million of Syrians have to integrate… We’re ruled by lunatic wishful thinkers.
Her Party is the Christian Democratic Union, a cuckservative Party.
