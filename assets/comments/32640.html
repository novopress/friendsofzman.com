        Derb quoting Melissa Chen: “Scrambling the poles of good and evil and destroying the entire foundation upon which the post-WWII order is built is to decimate Western civilization and to ensure that everything good about our way of life shall no longer endure.”I’d like to suggest an alternative motivation. Men whom I have immense respect for, like Derb and Jared, express their bewilderment at the current lamentable state of whites in all white lands. These men confess their inability to explain how this state came to be and what sustains it. As Derb has succinctly put it, “What the hell is wrong with white people?” “Why are white people such pussies?”Those of us who focus on j3wish power, especially their control of most media and the mythology of WW2, think that we may have an explanation. I believe that the almost complete control of the media by the chosen has allowed them to hijack white people’s unique compassion and gullibility to make white people hate themselves. Their purpose is white dispossession everywhere.My guess is that Derb and Jared have close chosen friends and thus they are unwilling to see the truth of this explanation. This is like someone with a black friend denying black crime rates. I’m just guessing and could very well be mistaken about everything that I have written, but this is an alternative motivation to the one ascribed to me by Chen.

            They’re conservatives. Stripped to its temperamental foundation, an emotional axiom, conservatism means siding with winners. More Americanly—Derb and Taylor are hyperbolically American, one might notice—it means never giving a sucker an even break.White people have lost, some admit (or lament or celebrate). Losers are not allowed to claim that they’ve beenmade to lose, no matter how obviously it’s so.It’s unsportsmanlike. Trumpian. Defeat, once present, is maybe notquitenature (or eternal judgment) made manifest, but it’s at least akind of self, who youare, not a thing that happened to you, a crime with a perpetrator, or a redressable grievance.The insight that generated the “alt right,” back before that got fiddled with (defeated), was that we are not conservatives. They’re our deadbeat dads. Did they really abandon the family to chase heeb ginch? Some say.

            Agree with your assessment, LineInTheSand, that Derb and Taylor may have (((chosen))) friends.A previous AmRen conference featured Laura Loomer as a speaker.After the conference, and upon more critical questioning, I asked myself why a Chosen girl (with too much makeup, it must be noted) would speak to a mostly huwhyte Wasp crowd.I think it’s a blind spot for some in the DR more generally, that the chosen people are not genetically Christian.And (((they)))play both sides. But when it comes down to it, often (((they))) would admit, when pressed, that “these [Wasps] are not ”my people.&#x27;”I know we should bicker amongst ourselves less. But when it comes to the chosen, we must recognize and draw the line (to include Mr Taylor’s invitation list of speakers at AmRen) that “these are not my people” and therefore not invited.Just my two cents, for whatever it’s worth.

                There’s no such thing as “genetically Christian”. Christian is a set of beliefs, not a character trait or physical characteristic.

                    I extended benefit of the doubt and assumed the intent was “genetically not Christian”. Which is probably accurate. The genes of the Jews who rejected Jesus exist in people likely not Christian today, while those Jews who accepted Him at the time are likely to be Christian with a probably prominent proboscis.
But it might cause consternation that would mean that those Jews who accepted the Messiah somehow lost their Jewishness, which would suggest Jewishness is not some indelible genetic character, either, but rather a state of mind.

OK, and how would one test that hypothesis against the others? I’m not saying it’s wrong, just that I don’t know how one could know it’s right. Assertions like “culture is downsteam from race” just beg the question.

                Yes, I sympathize. My temperament is very empirical and it’s taken a lot to push me to this kind of speculation. I understand the need for tests of the hypothesis, as much as the covert nature of the subject will allow.What do we know?*Demographics of media ownership*Almost all media is anti-white (hard to quantify but I trust most will agree)*History of criticisms and expulsions of the chosen all have the same charges by many different races*Abundant expressions throughout history of racial hostility for whites in writings of chosen (Derb couldn’t figure out why Susan Sontag would say “whites are the cancer of history” when he took her to be white!)

                    Yeah, I guess. I pulled up a list of the hosts on MSNBC, and was a little surprised that a “random” spot check showed only one “Early Lifer”. And that’s being generous. Someone’s grandpa was Jewish though she was raised Catholic. I thought for sure Joy Behar was going to be kike, but turns out Catholic. Thought Mika, but near as I can tell, not.Anti-white isn’t Jewish-only, (or it wouldn’t manifest in Latins or blacks) but it’s always possible it’s a contagious mind-virus hosted in Jews. Don’t know there’s any way to test for that. We’d need to find someone not already affected by the hypothetical virus who would live in close proximity to Jews. Any volunteers?As for historical criticisms, a good share of that is own goal. Since the 14th century, arguably the 12th, the Catholic church policy was that those who charge interest were denied the Sacraments and Christian burial. Jews could not care less about that, so lending became an almost exclusively Jewish profession. Same with medicine, with the Church putting severe sanctions on cutting the human body. Same with the legal profession, which was seen as exploiting your fellow man.I don’t mean to make an anti-papal rant, but the fact is, had the Church not screwed up by the numbers, we would probably have a very different world today.

        Credit to Derb for daring to mentioning the current point &amp; sputter of the usual suspects over Tucker interviewing a WW II revisionist. Even more credit to him for daring to mention (pro or con) that some question The Holocaust®. Later he makes the following statement:“This denigration of Churchill is part of a larger project to convince us that everything we thought we knew is wrong — to take a sledge-hammer to the myths and legends that normal citizens carry around in our heads.…Wait, though. Shouldn’t we prefer facts and truth to myths and legends?Well, yes, we should; but facts and truth about past events are hard to disentangle. Outside the Academy, few of us have the time or talents to do the necessary research.”On principle, why is it wrong for Deniers (or anyone, whatever their motive) to question the accuracy of historical events? Some will be better supported by evidence than others. At the least, even lacking evidence, one can examine the often-conflicting perspectives on historical events, real or imagined.Why is asking questions discouraged? This problem extends into a great many areas, whether events in Ukraine, or the safety of Covid-19 vaccines, or what-have-you. But for now let’s stick to Revisionism. If those asserting one perspective, one narrative of events are truly secure in their scholarship, while critical inquiry is rarely welcomed, it should at least be tolerated. When it’s ruthlessly squelched, whether by ostracism, de-platforming, or even fines and prison, that should be a red flag.Did you know, dear reader, that in many nations it is a serious criminal offense to claim The Holocaust® did not happen, or even that certain events were not as per the official received wisdom? Right there is a real head-scratchier. These are mostly “Western” nations where the very concept of the Enlightenment, of critical inquiry, of the scientific method reached its pinnacle. More than one researcher has been convicted of Wrongthink, resultantly going from the Academy to the Prison. (Just for comparison, in the UK quite a few commoners are currently serving comparable terms in prison for broadly similar crimes, like an ethnic slur against migrants.)Just the same – remains this interesting aspect. In (relatively) free societies, there areextremely fewfields of inquiry where it’s a criminal offense to delve too deeply into certain questions. Any reasonably skeptical person might be forgiven for jumping to the conclusion that somebody is trying to hide inconvenient facts, or perhaps, the lack of facts.The Jews have had a good run, but they always overplay their hand. Guys, the old shtick of “We’re the victims!” wears thin after a while. The mask is slipping; the unflattering opinions and facts (and in the interests of full disclosure, half-truths and lies) cannot be bottled up quite as easily in the era of a worldwide Internet.

            You are pointing out the core — free inquiry is free inquiry. No matter whose ox is getting gored.First Lord of the Admiralty means you are sitting in the left seat. Whatever went wrong in terms of naval forces, it was Churchill’s responsibility. Regardless of whatever one does later to atone, or whatever some bureaucracy later decrees.Six million lives implies six million names. Maybe 3 million beds. Maybe a million apartments. Rent. Utility bills. Germans are not known for shoddy records. The evidence should be easy. Those records were all blown up in the raids? As The Church Lady says, “How convenient.”Knowing the rule of 3s, (3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food, arguably 3 hours without clothing or shelter in winter) why bother with Tabun? In what way is the standard story more of a crime than just shutting off the spigots of those whose confinement legally makes the warden responsible for their wellbeing?

                Tough crowd.
Would it really matter who was coming to the defense of Thomas Jefferson when the feral hordes started knocking down statues? Facts cease to become facts if spoken by the wrong genotype?
That said, she’s quite the kook. Can’t be all bad since she called for the flogging of the Stop the Oil freaks. I’d trade her for Mitch McConnell any day of the week. Being on the right side every once in a while would be an improvement.

                    I have nothing against her.  I’m sure she is a very nice person. But she’s not us.  That she may or may not be useful to us in a given context is besides the point.  Accepting her as one of us is the Ben Shapiro ‘you have to love the constitution’ version of nationalism.

        I’m only 57 — meaning younger than Mr Derbyshire — but in my young school days I remember the word on Churchill was that he was a drunk and had been owned by the jews. This was the talk among the history buffs my older brother was friends with.  They would play Avalon hill board games and talk about this stuff all the time.  The word on hitler, and I think even the schools taught this, was that the germans were angry because in WWI the jews in Germany got to sit out the war and capitalize on the absence of German men and also take the women.so I’m not understanding why this Churchill or hitler revisionism is catching folks off guard or has them on the defensive, especially among the older crowd.these ideas have been floating in the western consciousness for going sixty years at minimum.

        Re: isolationism, (Mr.? Professor? John? Derb? I have no idea how to address you) sounds pretty sensible to me. I have precious little ability to affect things in my own county, let alone state or country. Influencing events in Italy or whatever? I have nearly as much ability to influence events in the past.
Kind of like putting on your own oxygen mask before trying to assist others.

        Interesting, as Z’s Friday podcast discussed maybe reinterpreting recent US history as possibly not the evil slave owning nation or white hatted hero riding in to save the day or the proverbial shining city on the hill.  But Derb clings to the Churchill worship – maybe rightfully so, regardless of his father’s, and others opinions…

                Carlson crapping on England but still vaguely optimistic about the US even though on most metrics the US is worse…His friend talking about the Irish becoming a minority in Ireland by 2070 whilst whites are probably a minority in the US right now.
Feels like diversionary tactics. Let me know when he starts in on Roosevelt or Eisenhower.

        Ten or fifteen years ago I was a definite Churchill fan.  Today, not so much.  I give him credit for roaring defiance at Hitler in 1940 after the defeat of France.  He also inspired the British people with his rhetoric.  I continue to believe that these observations remain largely true and were his greatest strengths.But there is a darker side to Winston Churchill.  In no particular order, his idea to invade occupied Europe through the Balkans instead of a cross-Channel operation into France bordered on the hare-brained.  Moreover, the early defeats of British forces in Asia by Japan in 1941 and 1942 were catastrophic.  Both theRepulseand thePrince of Walesbattleships were sunk when sent out without air cover.  The surrender of Singapore to numerically inferior Japanese forces in 1942 may have been the single greatest defeat of British arms in history.  Australia grew so alarmed by Japanese advances that it withdrew its forces from North Africa to defend Australia itself.  (In fairness, William Slim’s campaign against the Japanese in Burma in 1944 is a textbook example of maneuver warfare.) Churchill had to have been aware that American economic and financial sanctions were provoking Japan; yet he never, to my knowledge, tried to restrain the Americans or to prepare British forces in Asia for the inevitable Japanese riposte.  Churchill’s leadership in World War II caused Great Britain to begin to lose its empire and to become a definite junion partner to the United States.  It is possible that he played a very weak hand as well as anyone could have done under the circumstances.  I guess the other aspects of Churchill’s character that give me pause were his alcoholism (albeit a functional alcoholism) and his reckless financial adventures, which left him chronically in debt, subject to influence by his creditors, and requiring him to write books in his “spare” time to generate income.All in all, a reasonably effective leader, but hardly the towering figure I previously believed him to be.

        The winds of change, once limited to distant lands, have come to these shores. Their benefits — and I use the term loosely — accrue to the moneyed classes. With every lowering of social standards, the populace gets slower and clumsier mentally. Eventually, if this keeps up, North America will grow into a servant culture where the rentier class gets it’s shoes shined by fawning workers making minimum wage.Economic currents are in motion (the financial sector keeps expanding, swallowing other areas of commerce) to disenfranchise the common man.This transformation — built around non-European immigration because that is what the ideology is pushing — will see millionaires become centimillionairee and centimillionairee become billionaires.When Wall Street sold tranches of fraudulent debt, precipitating the 2008 recession, it was ushering in a new kind of “buyer beware” — this one suspected (rightly) the whole superstructure.In the end, only gold in the hands of the upper-middle-class will fend off this disaster in the making.— Greg (www.dark.sport.blog)

        I’m glad I finally found a forum to discuss Radio Derb.Coincidentally re Radio Derb this week, Tucker Carlson recently interviewed some joker named Darryl Cooper, a historian I guess, and Mr. Cooper is really down on Churchill.  Makes Churchill sound like some kind of psycho, Churchill playing with his tin soldiers as an adult, Gallipoli, abandoning Eastern Europe, yadda yadda.Ok, whatever. I think it was my last year of high school, or first year of college, I read Churchill’s History of the English Speaking People. More recently I read his war memoirs. Someone that can write like that, and hold down, what, an MP job, PM job, who knows, that person is not a psycho. Lucid, informative, engaging writing, with a sense of humor, and a deep appreciation of Western Civilization, and patriotic to the core. That person is a one in multiple generation intellect and leader. Did he have his flaws? Of course. Was he right about everything? No. Did he put his own interests ahead of his country’s? I didn’t get that impression.These Churchill snipers remind me of that old saying: when a fly bites a thoroughbred, the thoroughbred remains a thoroughbred, and the fly, well…We have a grandson named Winston. Proud of it.

        I agree with Derb’s colleague Kevin DeAnna on Churchill.  You should view a historical figure based on how well he did at achieving his goals.  Churchill wanted to preserve the British Empire and keep Britain on top of the world’s pecking order of nations, where it was when he was born into its aristocracy.  By any objective measurement, he was a complete failure.
