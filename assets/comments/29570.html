            Me too…De Santis obviously has had a brain cramp to fall in with the likes of Jeb, just to run in a race where he has no chance to legitimately gain the nomination, and even less chance of chance to win…He should have endorsed Trump and wait for ’28, when the deadwood will be gone…

        “Mine is a most peaceable disposition. My wishes are: a humble cottage with a thatched roof, but a good bed, good food, the freshest milk and butter, flowers before my window, and a few fine trees before my door; and if God wants to make my happiness complete, he will grant me the joy of seeing some six or seven of my enemies hanging from those trees. Before death I shall, moved in my heart, forgive them all the wrong they did me in their lifetime. One must, it is true, forgive one’s enemies– but not before they have been hanged.”— Heinrich Heine

            Gauss:  Interesting choice of quote.  I presume you are aware of Heine’s ‘early life and family’ details?  One then wonders just whom he considered an enemy to be hanged.

                Must you insist on ruining a good quote?  Me and Genghis Khan would have been racial enemies back in the day.  That doesn’t mean he never expressed some admirable sentiments.

        A couple of months back we argued whether similarities existed between our situation and Weimar G.  Z insisted that the presence of bipeds was the only similarity.  Many argued that the strong dollar belied my reasoning. Anyone change their mind?PS sorry to be such a petty prick.

            To White Knight here, I believe the zman point was “history rhymes but doesnt repeat,” so thinking the events and outcomes of the 1930s can be repeated in the 2030s is incorrect, because of fundamental differences.  You cannot simply cut and paste the past to the present and be guaranteed a good result, or even the same result.However, the inflationary recession, international martial humiliation of the country, the sexual degeneracy esp the trannyism, the feminism and equal rights/womens liberation, Continental negro-worship: there are many similarities that are growing more similar and more prominent every year.I think the valid counterpoint to Zman is that while a flu is different from a cold in material ways, the proper response is still the same. And the closer the flu’s symptoms to the cold’s, well….

        This all really smells like a replay of World War II.  The “Don’t get involved in Ukraine” crowd is very similar to the “Don’t get involved in Europe” crowd from the 1930s.  If history does repeat itself, the government will false flag the Russians kicking a puppy and all the normies will mobilize for the next Great Moral War against Evil and Bad Stuff except this time it kills 500 million instead of 50 million.

            …and, then as now, the same group is the primary driver of the push for war and the suppression of those who oppose it.
Of course, it is not only that group acting, but without their energy and power, probably neither war would have happened.

            1910 perspective here.In 1910, the human condition was a rising star so bright; no one alive could have imagined world wars brewing, the only contact with the federal government was the Post Office.
Most galling is that we are told to worship the Fathers of wars, “a clever trick that has allowed them to profit from finking.”
Without such creatures, what could we have been?  A world of Scandinavias, of former Canadas, of Beirut and Paris, of Tehran and Buenos Aires and Prague as the glittering jewels they used to be.

It created the most powerful and affluent nation in the history of mankind. It has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of grinding poverty and squalor. It did all that in less than 200 years! Your system will work fine…IF you deal with the diversity problem. Or, if you will…your enemies. You have a people problem because the human trash swarming in aren’t smart or civilized enough to live in a civilized nation. Unless this changes, America ends only one way…

            Glenfilthie-  The system passed the 1965 Hart-Celler Immigration Act.  And the group disproportionately involved with getting it passed came here via the system.  The system is impaired, to say the least.

                What keeps us all together is trillions in bribery (government spending).  The modern era has never once experienced a crisis that stopped this bribery.  Even for a time.  The greatest social experiment in history will come to its climax when the bribery stops or the currency exponentially inflates.  Either way.  Look out!

                    “Industrial society is the only society ever to live by and rely on sustained and perpetual growth, on an expected and continuous improvement.   Not surprisingly, it was the first society to invent the concept and ideal of progress, of continuous improvement. Its favoured mode of social control is universal Danegeld, buying off social aggression with material enhancement; its greatest weakness is its inability to survive any temporary reduction of the social bribery fund, and to weather the loss of legitimacy which befalls it if the cornucopia becomes temporarily jammed and the flow falters.

                The Hart-Celler (H.R. 2580) vote:https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/h125. It was the inevitable product of mass immigration from the mid-19th to the early 20th century. By the 60s all of the founding institutions had been co-opted by people who had no particular affinity for them other than as a means to wield power to benefit their particular groups.

                Are any of you capable of thinking like white men JZ?That is like blaming guns for crime, or spoons for making Orca Winfrey fat. If the system were to blame… how would you fix it? With the stroke of a politician’s pen? That is the nogger solution to everything – with lots of gibs and free money!To fix this, millions of PEOPLE will have to be deported. Tens of thousands of PEOPLE will have to be arrested and punished, and God only knows how many will need to be executedThese PEOPLE do what they do by playing the system against itself, undermining it or disabling it altogether. Your ancestors gave you a republic – it was up to you to keep it.But I suppose I should just STFU. All I can do at this point is make people angry about it and that won’t change any of what’s coming.

                    GF – Unfortunately, the system IS  the enemy.  Maybe it wasn’t a 100 years ago (though that might be debatable), but it sure as hell is now.  Further, there is no reforming it – at a minimum, everyone currently involved with it has to go.  Your third paragraph pretty much spells it out.  It won’t be pretty, let alone easy, but like I said, at this late stage, starting from scratch is probably what it’s going to take.  The Frogs got things going on – maybe they’re showing the way.

            Time to DEAL with them–if possible. The supply of Spahn Ranches is finite, even though the territory may be immense and population density may be sparse.

                That said, I’m watching with bitter satisfaction as Russia, a potential ally prior to the (((1881 Gang’s))) 2014coup, veers east- and southward to link up with China, Central Asia and the Middle East. The Belt Road Initiative may to turn out to be one of those utopian endeavors whose reach is beyond its grasp, but the prospect of an alliance of Technocratic and resource-rich nations is at least inspiring, compared to the West’s dogma of D–I–E, where science gets down to the business of war–well, Splendid Little Ones, at any rate.c, veers east and south toward China, East Asia and the Middle East.

        Pretty much all of them are enemies and the rest are cowards.
Think of how much cowardice is on display every day now.  “Men” and “mothers” who will not even defend their own children from perverts invading libraries and schools and hosting “kid friendly” strip shows.  Most Christians won’t even go to jail for their beliefs, let alone become martyrs for the faith.  Instead we get churches openly celebrating and promoting evil.
At least the degenerates have the courage to do what they are doing in the open where they could, in theory, face a pitchfork (or AK47) wielding mob.

            Z: “The goal of politics is always to harm the enemy and profit your cause.”Pondering the hopelessness &amp; despair of Meta-Darwinism is so very deeply depressing.No wonder so many Normies lack the gonads necessary for discovering how deep is the rabbit hole.It’s as though the Normies sensed, instinctually, that if they were to ackshually research the COVID v@xxines, then the horror of what they were to discover would have given them emotion-induced [rage-driven] heart attacks.Instead, the Normies opted for pharmaceutically-induced heart attacks.I almost don’t blame them for their cowardice.===============Speaking of Meta-Darwinism and pharmaceutical horrors…UPDATE: Eyedrops Sold In Drug Stores Nationwide Are Contaminated With Deadly Bacterial ‘Superbug’: MANUFACTURED IN INDIA – 3 People Die After Using Artificial Tears Products, 8 Lose Vision, 4 Have Eyeballs Surgically Removedhttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/4140274/postsSMDHing…

                Multicultural, exactly.  Exactly.  The roving bands of every nation became a human tidal wave.
(The nature of this, remarkably, was recorded in field reports made of clay tablets; rather than being erased and reused, they were baked in a palace fire, leaving us a permanent record by harried fronts.)
Cartel and all the gangs of any color will become the new locus of street power.
They were created by government fiat, I fear they will prove themselves worthy of government’s affection.

            The lower 48 is as militarily unassailable as ever and practically no amount of rot seems capable of changing that. Any talk (and it exists) of being conquered by China etc. is just as stupid and uninformed as fears of Japanese invasion in the 1940s or saying “we’d all be speaking German now” if we hadn’t sent our men off to Europe. These things were not possible then and they are not possible now.
Thus the GAE’s comeuppance, if and when it comes, has to be economic.

                That is why it wasn’t a military conquest. We were turned into another nation’s (or two or three) vassal by using The System against us. It was a long, slow institutional conquest.

I hesitate to make predictions about how long the US will be the major economic power because that could vanish in a blink of an eye or go on for decades due to things totally out of its control at this point. I’m leaning towards a shorter time line but grant that may not be the case. Jerome Powell is acting like the economic situation can be salvaged unless he’s engaged in some sort of 4D chess.

                        I actually meant “can be salvaged.” Powell is trying to shore up the dollar rather than allow the free money frenzy to continue; he thinks the currency is salvageable and is using traditional tightening to prevent devaluation. Whether that works, of course, is another question but he’s putting the brakes on the looting unless, again, there is some sleight of hand going on with him.

        I have this idea that civic nationalism could work, sort of, if Civnat G. Normiecon were able to recognize enemies. But when a man is elected president (say, Trump), and the “left,” unable to accept being out of power, goes into a frothing rage, half of the normiecons out there take them at their word that Trump must be the problem, rather than seeing the problem for what it is, deranged leftists unable to accept losing power.At the end of the day, Civnat G. Normiecon, just like the people he votes for (Trump included), cares excessively what leftists say and think about him, about what is said about him on the tv or written about him in the NYT. He is deathly afraid of being the left’s “other.”

        ZMan shows the way. The system is the enemy.   If somehow a Republican can get into office, there would be no practical difference between DeSantis and Trump.
Oh Trump would say he was anti-war and such but then Lindsey Graham would meet with him to explain that the war is really really necessary.  Or Ivanka would cry or something.    Then he would say that he was going to stop sending billions to Ukraine and withdraw the U.S. advisors but “the generals say we can’t do that.”

        The shit dog phenomenon.All domesticated dogs are descended from wolves. At some time in our ancestral past, man tamed wolves and slowly selected for traits that benefited hunter-gatherer tribesmen. And these first artificially-selected subspecies were generally large, strong, loyal, and skilled at alerting to danger. Later, other variants became work dogs (as in herding sheep and aiding hunting). Nowadays, we select for purely ornamentational traits and have created useless little yapping rat-like dogs that are no bigger than a real dog’s defecation pile.And the same phenomena is now happening with respect to “selecting” politicians. As a society, we now favor the worst possible traits in our political “leaders”, and over the past century or so, have created a subhuman variant that shall henceforth be termed “scheming weasel vermin.” These creatures are vile, ugly, and preternaturally evil, but possess one powerful skill. They can fool you into thinking they are your friend, and then later stab you in the back with glee in their heart and not a hint of guilty conscience. Will voting harder fix this? Not a snowball’s chance in Hell.

                The term spiteful mutant is from Michael A. Woodley of Menie.  He and Dutton were collaborators some time back and wrote a book together.  However, Dutton will and does give Woodley credit for coining the term.

            “Nowadays, we select for purely ornamental (sic) traits and have created useless little yapping rat-like dogs.”“As a society, we now favor the worst possible traits in our political “leaders”, and over the past century or so, have created a subhuman variant that shall henceforth be termed “scheming weasel vermin.” These creatures are vile, ugly, and preternaturally evil, but possess one powerful skill. They can fool you into thinking they are your friend, and then later stab you in the back with glee in their heart and not a hint of guilty conscience.”I go back to this line of yours “At some time in our ancestral past, man tamed wolves and slowly selected for traits that benefited hunter-gatherer tribesmen.”And ask you two questions:1) Who does the choosing of dogs as pets these days? (Hint, they’ve started switching over from cats)2) Who does the choosing and electing of politicians these days?🤔Perhaps that’s why we have the dogs and politicians we have nowadays.

            I would only add that the means for “selecting” is unpleasant.  While selective breeding played a role, mostly it was a subtractative approach.  Pet wolf bites kid, kill it.  Rabbit dog starts chasing deer, put it down.  We had a pet terrier when I was growing up that started killing chickens.  Gramps tried everything.  Tied a dead chicken around its neck etc…. Nothing worked. He regretted killing that dog (incidentally named maggot), later said he should have just got rid of the chickens.  Ahem, sounds a bit psycho when I write it down.

I think that process of artificial selection started about 4000 years ago with Abraham.

            Democracy is the god that failed, as a German professor of politics wrote. At it’s best it is of a very limited suffrage and a means to keep one clique from gaining permenant control. Then it works quite well, comparitively. But democracy obeys no limits over time. First it was universal male suffrage in the US by the time of the War Between the States. Then it was suffrage for women, debtors, the welfare dependant, millions of workers paid by fed, state, and local government, the dead, and finally the imaginary ballot.  But in truth the experiment was really over by the War, we’ve just been coasting on the creations of the dead all this time. Time’s out.Imagine trying to vote your way out of this. Really?

                The sadists in the UK government considered killing all the cats, “cuz Covid.”They had done such before to the cows, when “mad cow” was leaked from their Portland Downs biowarfare lab, and continue such with repeated assaults on chicken populations.Partly as commercial sabotage, and partly because the spiritual Infection drives them– imagine what would happen to the rat and mouse populations with a dearth of cats.  (And eggs help provide natural vaccination.)Say what one will about the poor cat ladies, but such evil: they won’t even let us keep our beloved pets.Remember that they would take from us the smallest bit of solace.

        Paul Gottfried’s been carrying the torch for Schmidt for decades but it looks like the old political theologist is about to come back in vogue now, anyway. Alexander Dugin’s books are illegal here in North Korea lite (you’d figure killing his daughter would have been enough), but his contrasting of Schmidt’s thalassocracies and tellurocracies is about to get tested in something besides a philosophy book. Land-based powers like China and Russia are figuring out that they only need to control strategic bits of the ocean—especially warm water ports—to beat former rulers of the seas like England and the USA.It turns out that not sailing the world is a good way to keep your eye on the homefront and not to accidentally bring back stowaways (re: immigrants) to contaminate your homelands. Also, like many captains away on long-term voyages, the USA and England have slowly grown crazy, warped in the head.It’s looking like Leviathan is going to go belly-up, starving for air on the shore, while Behemoth takes his time picking the carcass apart at his leisure.

        Zman: “While the people we insist on calling the Left run around playing politics, the conservatives spend their days making impressive charts and graphs explaining why they are right.”That describes Steve Sailer, the nice guy who just wants to be friends and convince the left and the mainstream right that, by golly, he’s right!Worse than Sailer though, who at least gets into racial issues, are those in the conservative corral of ineffective opposition, who say things like “Democrats are the real racists,”  “America is an idea, not a people,”  “Violent cities run by Democrats,”  “Individualism Bucko, not white identity,” “As long as the immigrants come legally,”  or “Stop trying to divide us!”If conservatives consider the left the enemy at all, it’s only because the left are the real racists, or they don’t insist that immigrants come here legally or something like that.

            “As long as the immigrants come legally,”
Urgh.
I think even as young as fifteen, when hearing discussions about our “new, highly benevolent arrivals”, someone would always utter this inanity. That, or “As long as they come to work.”.
Heh, well guess what? Theydidcome legally, theydidwork, and now we have lovely and diverse enclaves that function as convenient fifth columns whenever needed.
Put simply: Whilst I could have stomached a small number of these people, they do not belong here. And they should never have come.

                    There are any number of “studies” here that show our new vibrants work and “pay taxes”.  These studies also often show that the amount of welfare they receive is far in excess of any taxes these folk will pay during their working lives.I’ve read a few of these reports.  Nothing surprising.  What was revealing is that a few of these studies tended to indicate that such welfare use extended into the second generation—first generation born on American soil.  This too should not be surprising given HBD science.  Low IQ immigrants produce low IQ offspring and therefore a lower SES to be expected in a1st world, technological society.As I’ve said, the folk coming illegally are not engineers and doctors.

            Of course, Leftists are real racists, albeit not the only racists. The part of the syllogism the Grillers won’t supply, however, is that they are anti-white racists. That just comes too doggone close to white identitarianism, the political hemlock of the CivNats.

        Carl Schmitt said know your enemy. He also said that the Sovereign is always in control, even in a liberal democracy. Schmitt said that we see who is in charge when there is an emergency, and it’s the Sovereign.This is our problem now. We saw it during Covid and the “long emergency” of the GWOT. Whatever we want to call it -“Deep State”, “Oligarchs”, or Schmitt’s Sovereign – whatever – they are in charge. Trump never quite understood this. Obviously JFK did and look what happened.But they are not on the ballot and they rule from the shadows. That’s the whole point. Yes we have to know our enemy, but they are careful not to reveal themselves in a blatant way. So we are left to punch at empty public avatars. We are now two generations into this problem and it may take one or two generations to solve it, if we ever do. One election cycle is really nothing in the scheme of things.

            Every time the press begins to question Biden and you hear chattering offscreen from an army of harpies shouting, “Come on, we have to go!” just once I wish the cameraman would spin his rig around so we could see these people. I think Zman says they all come from some institute where they’re trained like actors, and most are former Obama drones. Soros is obviously one big string puller, but there are plenty of others supporting this.

                Yes, but Johnson and then Nixon waged a losing war in Vietnam and when we left, the mood of the country was toward  no more wars of nation building in crap holes.  Reagan reversed that sentiment with Grenada and his over riding need to topple the USSR and the resulting military buildup.  We could have let the Cold War go and let the USSR collapse and organically change but for Reagan.Reagan rebuilt the armed forces such that Bush (a neocon) had an irresistible tool of aggression handed to him.  In Gulf War 1, Bush 1 could field a force of half a million to face Saddam.  In GW2, Bush 2 could only field a bit over 120k.I like Reagan, but he really was the inflection point getting us to where we are today.

                    Grenada was not the catalyst for that. It was the easy victory in Gulf War I.
It’s also easy to pretend in hindsight that everybody knew the SU’s collapse was a matter of time or that it wasn’t a threat to the west.

        “[T]he system has evolved to harm the bulk of the population. That means you participating in it profits the forces that are committed to your destruction.”
Exactly. The delusion that one can strike a blow against the establishment by partaking in electoral shenanigans sponsored by that same establishment is copium of the highest potency. A rigged game cannot be won by regular folks; it can only properly be ignored and avoided. Detachment is key. Psychological secession must precede the real thing.

            Not voting is an easy and least effective way of not participating in the system.  Going off grid (if enough do it) is the most difficult and effective.  Sand in the gears is probably moderately difficult and effective.

        I have maintained since 2019 that we can vote our way out of this, but not in a way that CivNat G. Normiecon thinks or wants.A vote for the Bad Orange Man is a vote for civil war, initiated by the spiteful mutants in and out of the Regime. That is why the Vichy Right rolled over in 2020 and will again in 2024, because they know that the Bad Orange Man being elected President will be the election of 1860 all over again, not because of what the Bad Orange Man would do, which would be empty posturing and Twitter slap fights, but because the Regime hates him and what he represents and the potential threat he and Heritage America poses to them.

            That’s sort of my take as well. The United States was convinced a Trump re-election would have caused California at a minimum to exodus the union. They were not afraid at all about how conservative areas would respond to election fraud. What apparently was not seen was that the rubes no longer would support foreign interventionism and imperialism afterwards.
The USA simply is a conman who has run his grift so long and so successfully he cannot fathom the mark is onto him. The world has already moved on, and the citizenry is starting to do so mentally.

                    That’s exactly what I am contending, in exactly the same way that everyone in 1860 understood what a vote for Lincoln represented. We all know that the Right, for any sense of it, will not and can not initiate or emulate 1775 or 1860, for any number of reasons, including the ones Z brings up today. Thus, forcing the “Left” to do what they so obviously, desperately want to do, which is bring on the showdown and quit postponing the inevitable is the “Vote BOM” tactic.

                I assume you are responding to Pickel Rick above, who states giving the Regime a big FU by successfully voting the God Emperor back into office will trigger the Final Solution, one way or the other.If that conflagration eliminates the regime’s apparatchiks and other acolytes, then the process of rejuvenation can finally begin.If not, if Evil truly is meant to win, due to inherent human nature (selfish materialism, because we are all mortal, resulting in a reversal of Pascal’s wager), then so be it.   Let us determine our destiny now.That is what Pickel Rick is saying above.   Personally, I agree.  Let’s see if people’s stated values are really valuable to them, enough to actually fight for them in the material world.I suspect those who want to win will do so.  I also suspect it will be the Devil who triumphs here on Planet Earth, whether he is real or a stand in for human genetics.   Having observed the comments here and on other dissident right websites, I think we all know I am right.

            Excellent points, Rick.
“the Regime hates him”
They fear him more than hate him, or hate him because they fear him.
Trump had the potential to completely turn over the apple cart and derail the gravy train by cutting funding to the pentagon, exposing China’s bribe money &amp; control of DC politicians, limiting immigration in any way, replacing American energy independence with windmills and solar collectors made in China, and the offshoring of American manufacturing.

                Did he do any of these things? To me, this is the fallacy of the line of thinking in this thread. In four years, Trump did nothing. In four more years, he would have done nothing. Antifa did a solid effort at harming innocents, and nothing happened. Now, I realize fear can be irrational (i.e., they fear Trump even though he is no threat). I do not believe this is most likely; however, I can certainly acknowledge a fine line exists between hatred and fear.

                    The fear is how the Left would react; no one thinks the Right would do anything. Trump cannot win, in my opinion, and even then would not be allowed to do so even if the State was required to employ extreme measures as it has in the past.Frankly, I think this is in a sense the end of the line for the GAE and explains why it is strapping down its remaining satrapies in Western Europe because the rest of the world is moving on. One thing it does not want is the Ukraine grift being dragged into a political debate. DeSantis will roll over on that issue.We are in for quite a ride the next year or so.

            This is the truth. The “left” (for lack of a better word) is simply unable to accept being out of power. When they call Trump “divisive,” what they mean by that is “someone who keeps me from having power.”
I think it’s an open question if they can accept any future republican president, regardless of how milquetoast or compromised.

                I don’t think it is possible that Trump can be elected, even if he gets the nomination.  As Zman showed recently, the Democrats now have a virtual lock on the electoral college.  Trump showed he was either not willing and/or able to put in the hard work to defeat the enemy while he was in office the first time, so I doubt he could win even if the system wasn’t rigged.  Other than Trump’s hardcore fanboys, nobody is going to get terribly riled up if Trump gets the nomination and then loses the general election to Biden again.If DeSantis were to get the nomination and then lose the general election (which he certainly would), it might wake up a lot of normies to the fact that the current system is beyond repair.  I don’t think DeSantis is any kind of savior but compared to Biden, he is George Washington.So, while I will sit out the voting process, I would like to see DeSantis get the nomination to demonstrate how screwed up “our democracy” truly is.

            Interesting point. However, we all know voting for Cheeto Hitler is futile. The man doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance of ever being seated in the Anti-white House again. It’s far more likely he’ll be exhibited in the stocks in broad daylight in front of some nuggra memorial.

        I’m probably naive, but I think this started ramping up during the Obama years. The Hope and Change folks pretended otherwise, but he was a typical filthy Chicago machine politician, with all of the “benefit your friends and hurt your enemies” that entails. The federal government and the national Democratic party didn’t seem to obviously punish folks who didn’t vote for them before that. The one-two punch recently of the feds ignoring the Ohio train spill and local Dem governments paying Antifa/BLM thugs for rioting show this pretty starkly.

            “The Hope and Change folks pretended otherwise, but he was a typical filthy Chicago machine politician, with all of the “benefit your friends and hurt your enemies” that entails.”Nope, Obama wasn’t a goodChicagopolitician. When he went up against a REAL Chicago politician, Bobby Rush, in the 2000 Democratic Primary for Illinois 1st District, Rush cleaned the floor with his skinny butt.What he was and is is a goodIllinoispolitician. His State Senate election was to a district full of “squishy headed Liberals”. It did help him his Liberal leaning friends kneecapped his Republican opponent Jack Ryan by releasing details of Jack’s divorce from actress Jeri Ryan and the subsequent custody battle. The records were sealed but theChicago Tribuneand various Chicago TV stations went judge shopping and found someone who ordered the records unsealed. Ryan bowed out and the idiotic Alan Keyes filled in and suddenly Obama’s a US Senator.That said, he really DOES fulfill “the “benefit your friends and hurt your enemies” that entails.” Thank your lucky stars he was as uninterested in going full Iron Fist as he was.

                Well, his terms in office were not Iron Fist; think of them instead as a slowly, almost imperceptibly, metastasizing cancer, and that certainly by design.

            An awful lot of conservatives spend an awful lot of energy denying enemies. Our enemies are not this group or that group, see? They’re certain individuals coincidentally associated with this or that group. The *real* enemies are people who are, and will always remain, outside your personal sphere of action.One thing that stands out in thinking about fighting the entire system was the way the old communists worked. Lots of actions against things not obviously part of the system: vandalism of public transportation, for example. It was a form of the medieval concept, really. The sovereign who cannot provide security is not really sovereign.

        Yes, the system itself has become the enemy, and it has overwhelming force and power and is increasingly sociopathic. It also lacks legitimacy at this point, which is why it is stepping up its bullying. “You don’t like our Ukraine grift? Tough. We will destroy you.” The Armenians can tell you about how end-stage empires behave. It is something dissidents always need to keep in mind.I disagree that the conservatives as defined by Buckley ever sought to win, though, as in impose an ideological or political solution. Their role was to act as foil but not to reverse anything; Buckley as much as admitted this at times.As for the empty pageant known as American politics:“The trouble is DeSantis has a very thin skin, so he could not resist taking cheap shots at Trump with regards to the indictment business. He also flip-flopped on his Ukraine statements, probably fearing that he may have jeopardized his support from the Kagan cult.”In a true liberal democracy, going full-bore warmonger would have finished off DeSantis yesterday, and it could yet although that is less likely. The State either will criminally hamstring Trump or murder him. That’s the American way. How could it possibly abide a national debate on its Imperialism Forever project? Granted, the GAE is dying, but there’s more booty to plunder and mere whims of the population is no impediment.

        The same people have apparently gotten lazy in the justifications for NeoCon adventures. The new(old) reasoning for escalating involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict is so we can ‘fight’ them over there instead of in the USA. Sound familiar? This convoluted logic was used for Iraq after the WMD business ended up being nothing but smoke. This Red Dawn mindset continues to convince people that these political factions actually care about them. Meanwhile, as we fund pensions and salaries in Ukraine so Zelensky can buy another exotic car and send his wife on Paris shopping trips, the CBO has recommended means-testing for VA disability. To help balance the federal budget of course. These folks are evil to the core.

                The logic stream is that if Putin is allowed to take parts of Ukraine then the Russian flag would be planted in Paris within a year. They are now going with the alleged domino effect of communism from Vietnam.

                        Heh.The whole “Russia will invade all of Western Europe” thing is farcical on it’s face.However, many people I know will say things like, “If we don’t stop him now, then he may well push through Europe!”. How on Earth will he do this? And why would he want to? It is painfully clear that Russia has land desires on certain parts of Eastern Europe and that’s been going on for God knows how long.But pushing into Germany?! France?! And then England!? Bwahaha.Who knows, the fellow may nuke us; but I don’t think a westward drive from land forces and air forces is going to happen. And that’s just a cursory analysis.Now think of the width of the initial front, the number of countries involved and the stretched supply lines.Having said all that about Putler, he didn’t call me no white supremacist.

                        Orange Frog –Thinking of the stretched supply lines implies that our highly educated professional class:a. Knows about supply lines and that they are critical to winning any warb. Thinks that logistics is something other than something they saw implied as cool when thinking about investing in Amazon because it, “is a logistics company.”Never underestimate how poorly educated, unable to think and simple minded the vast majority of our fellow border-in-name-only dwelling economic units are. This is particularly true of the college educated.Of course, the people who write and fax the press releases to every press release poster, (“journalist”), know that. They also know that The Deplorables have wised up to their blustery paranoia rousing tactics. That is why they want them and the white men who may some day wake up replaced.

                    Maybe the common folks in Europe would be better off if the Russians did invade. The diversity would leave a war zone and a Russian controlled governemnt certainly would be better for the natives than what they have now. I could support an invasion.

You’re clearly ill-informed. I live in North East England, and I can tell you that I definitely saw a T-34* outside my front door this morning. They’re here!
Just look outside your frontdoor! Ivan will be in the bush, Olyksandr above the porch, Dmitri will no doubt be going round back and Vlad will be coming down the chimney.
*The MSM tells me that Ivan has to roll out old, old weapons coz dey be loozin’.

                        Putin’s threat to Europe (really the GAE) is that he has the potential to be a bigger ally to Europe than the GAE.  Russia has vast natural resources to provide to a resource poor Europe.  America has little to offer except a military and nuke umbrella.

                It is sort of “we have to fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them in Western Europe” variation, though. It is a stupid claim but the rubes have eaten the dog food a long time so they do this out of habit. It is hard to believe DeSantis, who seems intelligent enough, thought it would fly. The only reason the State doesn’t tell the populace “suck it, we are doing this” is due to the need to preen before the world as a liberal democracy. That the world has moved past the United States gets as unnoticed as the population no longer believes the oligarchs.

                        Somewhere (somewhen?) there’s an alternate history timeline in which Hitler was accepted to art school, had a successful career as an artist and never became seriously involved in politics.
In this alternate timeline, does someone else fill Hitler’s role as leader of the NSDAP?  Does the NSDAP simply fade into obscurity as just another post-Great War German political party?  Does Stalin’s USSR become the sole great totalitarian power in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, unopposed by a nonexistent Third Reich?
