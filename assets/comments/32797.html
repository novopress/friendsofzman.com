            If one looks at the stat’s for the USA, say PISA or simple gun violence, anywhere US Whites are a *separate* category from other races, the stat’s improve markedly. In short, most all the bad stuff we hear about America disappears when we remove the other (inferior ?) races and we (the USA) begin to rate/compare acceptably with our European counterparts, who as of yet have not quite caught up with our “diversity”—which we all know is our greatest strength as a nation.Conversely, if one then compares the selected minorities taken from US stat’s, we see a strong relationship between these minorities’ “home country’s” stat’s. So that for example, we find high murder rates in South America that correlate quite well with Hispanic murder rates in the USA. These stat’s are (purposefully) not kept for obvious political reasons, but once in a while have been inadvertently/inconveniently produced.

                In the heyday of NCLB, there was tons of data being made public about schools and it turned out that our best schools measured up to and even exceeded the schools of places like Finland. Of course you couldn’t talk about the demographic profile of our best schools… but that didn’t change the reality. NCLB was pure blank slatism, that with enough “resources” and the right “system” every school could be as good as the best one in Finland. Of course, it didn’t work, and was abandoned, and now the same people who pushed it will say that expecting certain students to turn in assignments on time is white supremacy…. While still believing in the blank slate.

                    Here is a good book on the matter:
“Bad Students, Not Bad Schools” by Robert Weissberg, published in 2010.
Weissberg’s book argues that many of the problems in American education are not the result of poor-quality schools or teachers, but rather issues with the students themselves.  In the sections regarding students specifically, he cites numbers and races.  One thing that sets this book apart (IIR) is the number of citations throughout.  You’d think you were reading a journal article.  Unfortunately, Weissberg passed away recently.

                                Agreed. Likely no one would have said, “Yeah, but JOOO!.” because it agreed with the preferred policy…
I do appreciate the reference.

                                In any group which we look at with askance, there are “good ones.” Our evaluation of other groups is based on inductive reasoning, i.e. what the probability is that a random sample of that group will be like.
Weissberg was one of the “good ones.” I had not heard that he passed, but if that is true it is unfortunate.

            Compsci, what you say is accurate. But bear in mind that cultures change over time. It is theoretically possible that the Hispanic in America will have grandchildren whose characteristics are at least slightly more like the heritage Americans.

                The opposite is perhaps more common. Ergo, the parents who immivade AINO are reasonably good citizens, but their children or certainly grandchildren regress to the dysfunctional and antisocial mean.

                    Ostei, what about the Italian-Americans who moved away from the Mafia stereotype and became indistinguishable from heritage Americans?They were assimilated into the melting pot. American dominant culture is very strong. Blue jeans, Coca Cola, hip hop music … they get on the brain. Maybe you forget the barrio too.

                        Blue jeans do not a heritage American make.  You are a standard grade fool, pushing the myth of ‘assimilation.’  The Italian immigrants changed America at least as much as it changed them – and even then only those who dispersed around the country and intermarried with other ethnicities.  The South Americans are heavily indio and negro, and those genetics are dominant.  It would take at least 4 generations of intermarriage with idiot Whites to make a significant change.  There are are plenty of Mexican mestizos whose grandchildren are 60-85% ‘white’ who are still Mexican in both appearance and mindset.Go peddle your pabulum and your blog elsewhere.

                            If culture is so inflexible, then how can the newcomers possibly adjust to American life at all? If biology is UBER ALLES, then why does Pitbull, a Latin American, sing in a black American vernacular, and Robert Rodriguez, a Mexican American, make movies like Quentin Tarantino? I am skeptical about those who deny the plasticity of the human mind. They seem to be demonstrating that plasticity by their very actions.

I think I speak for every dissident here when I say this is an extraordinarily perspicuous point and utterly convincing. We’re now all in the open-borders camp. Thanks for opening our eyes.

And as far as plasticity goes, tell it to all the twin studies, and all the negroes adopted and raised in White middle class homes.  Talk about drinking one’s own kool aid . . . .

                                I largely agree with your point.  The mind is very plastic.  There is evidence for this all around us.However, where I really disagree with you is that it is much easier to make things worse than it to make them better.It is trivially easy to turn a future genius child into a retard, but impossible to turn a retard into a genius.  Damaging people is easy. Just starve them. Beat them. Deprive them of any stimulation by putting them in a darkened soundproofed cage.  This will mess up anyone.  While this is the extreme, there are many lesser versions of this.If biology is UBER ALLES, then why does Pitbull, a Latin American, sing in a black American vernacularHow the hell is this an improvement in the mestizo stock? Or even them becoming more American?  Becoming more like blacks is not helping them or changing them into being more American.Reproducing with us over time may very well improve their lot, but look what it does to ours!  They get slightly better, our stock gets worse.  Keep in mind a lot of these people have Spanish or Portuguese admixture.  Didn’t help the Spaniards!

                                “If culture is so inflexible, then how can the newcomers possibly adjust to American life at all?”
American culture ought not to be flexible enough to accommodate the culture of Mexicans, Guatemalans, Haitians etc.
So your examples of “good” newcomers are a Latino named Pitbull who sings like a black (rapper?) and a beaner who makes ultra-violent movies like Tarantino? To hell with such mental plasticity.

                        Because the intent of an Italian mafia in America was to become more like the dominant Anglo-Germanic majority, their business pattern was to be completely legitimate by the fourth generation. Note too that the Irish did the same after a rough start.(The Sicilians wanted to leave their kith in a stronger position, so they took shortcuts.)Can the Latinos? Or will they become more Latino, as Latinos, too rapidly, become the dominant majority.I say they still have Reconquista on the mind, and will demand that we accomodate to them. That is, they will take territory, driven as they are by overpopulation and lack, now that the Mayorkases have opened the gate. Aztlan beckons.(I speculate that their deep ancestral kin, the Asians, will be quite compatible. Asians and Latinos are both born with a purplish triangular patch at the bottom of the spine, the tailbone, which fades by the second year. It is a genetic signature, like sloped eyes and heavy, straight black hair, and sparse beards.)Most fortunate are we that the mestizo and european are already heavily linked genetically, linguistically, and culturally, and have proven to be a postively compatible mix. So strong is our Upgrade that even the erectusoid African Semitics and Indian Abos civilize somewhat, over time.Me and a black were lightly arguing which would come out on top in the end. The mexican, listening, interjected, “What about us?”I looked at the black and said, “We’ve exhausted each other in our little war…say hello to the new boss.”

                            Alzaebo, you write an intelligent piece and I only hold to my original argument about human brain plasticity. The human mind is a wondrous thing, capable of turning out machines by the million and songs and music. Dominant cultures have a way of eliminating weaker ones. Look at America’s culture: it has spread around the world, supplanting weaker cultures. Are you seriously proposing to me that the Guatemalan or Colombian culture is a match for the institutionalized, techno-propagated American mass giant, with its movies, and television, and music? I think not. I think, in the end, the Reconquista will blur into historical time and America will take a few bits from the “immvaders” and discharge the rest into the stratosphere. Nobody f*cks with America and gets away with it.

                                    Yep. Assuming @Greg is using “plasticity” correctly, what most people call “regression to the mean” is a flat-out debunking of cultural plasticity.
Personally, I think it’s largely out of laziness with a good measure of rebellion. It’s so much easier to be a violent layabout like your classmates than to strive to better yourself like dad.

                        There is a huge difference between Italians, on the one hand, and Nicaraguans/Gambians, on the other. All cultures are not equal, nor are they equally assimilable.

                            Ah, but Ostei I would argue EVERYONE is assimilable. Everyone with eyes to see and ears to hear is susceptible to the messages of his surroundings. Those messages are constant, purring, dramatic. A culture is not a voluntary thing, it is built into the biology of the human matrix. But culture itself can take infinite forms. Everything from the human sacrifice of the Phoenicians to the prim-mouthed fussiness of the Puritans is allowed on the table of life. The human-sacrificing citizens of Tenochtitlan became the good Catholics of Mexico City. THEY were changed. A more forceful culture simply mind-raped them into submission. America’s dominant culture IS partly blue jeans, and partly Coke, and partly movies, and partly house parties and partly university attendance and prom dances. It’s a billion things, big and small.

Mexico City full of “good Catholics” remains a shithole. Because it’s full of the descendants of Aztecs and their neighbors.

                                    Vizzini, the Spanish culture that took over the Aztec one was inferior itself. Look at Spain today: a second-world nation in a first-world Continent. And even in Mexico City, there are desirable neighborhoods.I am not arguing that culture is not persistent. Nor am I suggesting we import millions of hispanics. I am no liberal. Far from it! But to suggest that the human mind is not plastic is absurd. I don’t know if black Africans can ever develop space shuttles or write classical music. But culture can certainly stop them from eating human beings or headhunting each other. Culture can change their behavior in fundamental ways.I think you sorely underestimate the sheer might and power of American culture, and its desirability to foreigners.

Spain may not be Switzerland, but it’s a dam’ sight superior to Mexico. And the genetic composition of the populaces of the respective countries is the primary reason why.

                                        XLOVELI,The words mind and brain aren’t  synonyms of each other, so mind plasticity is not the same thing as brain plasticity. Different categories.It’s premature moreover to believe that brain plasticity is uniform throughout the brain. The cerebral cortex is arguably the most plastic, and the brain stem, the least. So expect to learn that much of what you’re calling culture finds its neural correlates in the neocortex.Notice however the increasing alienation of Evropean Americans from the changing American culture. Does this suggests that the Evropean brainstem or cerebellum are rejecting American culture? If so, maybe it follows that culture supervenes on the cerebrum in different ways or in some amount which varies from culture’s supervenience on other parts. And that this supervenience varies among breeds of humans. It’s a topic for research, no doubt.It’s quite possible, as well, that the plasticity of the hemispheres is unequal. Their shapes tend not be mirror images of each other, so there’s another hint about possibile inequality of plasticity. Iain McGilchrist has written about hemisphericity, partly to debunk ideas of left-right differences which gained popular acceptance during the past 55 or so yrs. Hemisphericity, he argues, is not what we were led to believe.That ought to straighten out your thinking about plasticity somewhat. So how is Xdeepr Corp. coming along? Is it in motion yet? and cash flow positive?I want to bring you [delicioustacos] to Vancouver to work for me, Xloveli the writer and singer and movie director. I am none of those things now, but I will be. I want you to head up my movie studio or whatever else you want to do. I plan on running a conglomerate of sprawling businesses....Xdeepr Corp. is the name I’ll be giving my business…Xdeepr will reap the profits and form a society of like-minded men. We’ll bring attractive young chicks from around the White World to date and bang. And marry, if you want children to raise on your own.

                                They actually were not changed. In 1790 in the City of Mexico, the statue of Coatlicue was unearthed, and immediately the people started worshipping the statue. The Church immediately confiscated it and put it under guard — it is now in some museum and yes, there are still offerings given to it to this day.Santa Muerte is just the Aztec war/death god Huītzilōpōchtli . The Mayans have their own version, and MS-13 with their face tattoos are pretty much the same as their Mayan Ancestors.You can argue the same with Nordic Christianity. The Puritans were just a Ragnarok obsessed, bunch of Vikings semi-Christianized but not fundamentally changed. They no longer worshiped Odin but they otherwise had the same general views of holiness, how to live, how to govern themselves, etc. [Puritans came from the Danelaw, East Anglia, where the Vikings ruled for about 500 years relatively unchallenged and longer being tolerated].People are who they are. They don’t fundamentally change. You cannot with culture make them smarter, for example. The forms of the religion can be forcibly changed by outside invaders but the innate function does not really change.

                                    Whiskey, let’s take the Nordic Christians as an example. You say they didn’t change their general views or how to live. But how did those things develop? They CULTURALLY EVOLVED. The Nordics once believed and behaved differently; over time, they adapted to changing circumstances and made the appropriate revisions to their way of thought/existence.I think a better argument against me is the question of hereditability of IQ. If hispanics are biological retards, comparatively speaking, then no amount of cultural education will improve them. They’re dreck, garbage.But when the Spaniards got to Mexico in 1513, they were amazed and impressed with the Aztec capital. They saw that Tenochititlan was bigger than most European cities, and fed itself on a lake with boats carrying incessant supplies of fruits and vegetables. It was a clean city, and livable, with an emperor. Could it be that the brutalizing effect of Spanish occupation, coupled with the pandemics that swept the land, impoverished the Mexican natives and degraded their culture? I don’t know, maybe they’re crap and we should kill them all. What do you think?

                                            That was my understanding as well, but since I’ve heard a few researchers in the field claiming the higher number.
He’s ChatGPT’s verdict on the question—please don’t take this as any support of the legitimacy of Google’s AI product, just saying I did not pull the figure out of my ass:
”In the United States, research on genetic admixture has shown that the African American population generally has a significant proportion of European ancestry. On average, genetic studies indicate that the African American population has between 15% to 25% European ancestry, with considerable variation among individuals.”

                                    This is crude and broad wrt a complex topic, but I’ll give a swing at it.Culture is developed within the framework of race, race from biology and biology from environment.  Certain behavioral tendencies follow from biology and Darwinian survival, hence heritable.  Here we delve into the “Big Five”.“The Big Five Personality Traits is a widely accepted model used in psychology to describe human personality. These five traits, often referred to by the acronym OCEAN, encompass broad dimensions of personality. Each trait represents a spectrum between two extremes, and individuals fall somewhere along the continuum for each trait.”Some studies claim to have shown differences among the races wrt these traits: Openness,Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism.  Yes, there is conflation between culture and biology if we measure such in adults, but younger children have been tested as well.One famous example replicated often is wrt to “time preference”between Black and White children.  Each offered one cookie now, or two cookies after a few minutes delay.  White children more often delay a few minutes and get the two cookies offered.

I’m still loathe to accept any “sociological” answer as I ever was, so probably never the twain will meet. (Sociology being a soft “science”, granting way too much latitude to the “science” bit.)
I get that kids have different time preference, yet I have yet seen any where black kids raised as “white” have been compared to white kids raised as “black”, if that’s even possible.
What we have is that black kids raised by blacks with a chip on their shoulders tend to have chips on their shoulders, etc.

                                            No argument there.  But does having a “chip on your shoulder” account for Black on Black violence in their communities?  Most violence committed by Blacks is upon their own race.  I argue that it’s a propensity for quick and reflexive action (impulsive and not thought through and definitely not specific to the White race) which is a heritable behavior precisely because such was beneficial to survival and reproduction in Africa.
Hence, I say culture (violent proclivity) is downstream from biology.  The question is one of amount of heritability and contribution, which is still under debate.

                        This is such a brainlet tier take I do not even know where to begin especially since everyone else already corrected you numerous ways.1) What is different between Italians assimilating last century and the brown goblins flooding the zone today? Last century you were taught “you are AMERICAN now, drop your old ways”. And they did.This century you are taught America is the worst most racist place on earth, so YOUR culture is superior. Keep it, and terraform America into a goblina brown slurry genetic shithole like the place you came from. More clear now brainlet?2) Italians and Irish, at the end of the day are Europeans. They vastly differ from 85IQ squatemalans, goblinas, la creaturas and every other mestizo descended mud race? More clear now brainlet?3) American “culture” is not fucking coca-cola and blue jeans. I know your general age but your entire take on this topic makes you sound like a boomer tier normie in a very unflattering way. I suggest you pipe down now… American “culture” today is the absolute worship of negroes as gods. Second to that all other swarthy races, sexual deviants, and wahmen in that order. What time machine did you just step out of where “Coca-cola and Blue Jeans” is still a thing? Just stop…Lastly, your ‘hot take’ on Spain speaks of someone that hasn’t been anywhere and gets all their info from the internet. Spain is light years ahead of Mexico in nearly every possible way including the ability to WALK in the cities without being murdered unlike even US cities. Europe’s cities, in general, absolutely bury US cities and simply avalanche any cities ‘south of the border’.Pay attention to what others say for once instead of sh-tting up the board with your uninformed hot takes, be a learner, not a sophist. A very timely lesson given today’s topic…

                        Greg, you have taken a false statistical abstraction to make a false generalization to suit your delusional foolishness. The others have answered you well and properly, particularly Apex Predator, but Mexico is a good case study worth going further with.Cortez conquered what would become Mexico City in 1521. It became a Spanish colony subject to good Catholic missions at the time. Today, Mexico has a habit of murdering more American citizens than all other nations combined. It is rife with corruption, bribery, extortion from the average police officer to the heights of public office. The cartels string up dismembered corpses to remind Mexicans who is really in charge of what areas. Its main exports are drugs, human trafficking and Dia de Muertos, so death. International car factories do not count.500 years and ~25 generations later, Mexico still worships death. It is a spiritual mutt stuck between two parents. To make Mexico an actual “good Catholic nation”, it would need to be conquered again, the cartels exterminated to the last man, the culture purified through new missions to the good Catholic way against the world condemnation of genociding Latino culture, and then maybe in another 200 years, Mexico might be a good Catholic nation. At least 700 years, two full conquests, two cultural genocides to make death worshipers into good Catholics. Maybe.Cultural assimilation. Biological evolution. Spiritual enlightenment. Whatever you want to call it, it is not quick. It is not easy. It is not natural. It is not bloodless.And the shallow, corporatized hedonism that passes for GAE culture has no hope of ever doing it.

                Greg, this is where you might be mistaken.  Your tacit assumption is that behavior—as in violent aggressive behavior—is cultural in nature.  This may be true in part, but behavior is also genetically inherited.  Cross cultural studies across different continents, but same races seem to indicate such.  The search I admit for genetics involved still remains unsettled, but that only a matter of time and numbers.

                    “behavior is also genetically inherited…”
Is it? I’ve been asking for evidence of this well before I encountered Zman, but so far, it’s just assertion.
I’ve obviously seen the “regression to the mean” stuff, which I think is probably mis-attributed, but the whole, IKAGO position makes plain it’s not simply genetic.

                            Wait, what part are you disputing?
Are you asserting that pretty much EVERY first generation Nigerian is an outlier? Or that his and her genetics do not carry forward?
We do ourselves no serivice to claim things that are easily factually contradicted.

                                Nigerians who come to AINO are, by their very nature, the topmost cream of Nigeria’s cognitive crop. They are thus outliers by Nigerian standards, and within one or two generations their lineages will regress to the Nigerian mean.

So if the first gen are genetic outliers and genetics are determinative, why aren’t their kids also genetic outliers?
They got the right genes, right?

                                        It’s not that simple. If my dad’s IQ was 140 and my mom’s IQ was 130, that does not mean my IQ will be 135. Parental genetics set parameters–it’s highly unlikely that the child of cretins will be a towering genius–but are not specifically determinative. In vitro and environmental factors in early childhood also play roles. And what’s more, I strongly suspect the Nigerians’ children will marry American nuggras, which will begin the downward descent of intelligence. Moreover, they will readily absorb AINO’s negro supremacy and anti-white racism, with all the dysfunction and harm that entails. We don’t want these people, and we dam’ sure don’t need them.

                                Not sure where to place this comment, but it is for many just made.  Regression to the mean is a first generation, one shot event.  A cancellation, if you will, of error within the two mating partners.  A new baseline is produced, not necessarily the same as the general population of the parents’ stock  however.

                If any part of what you say is true, Greg, then how do you explain the negro problem?  Generations of preferences, advantages, unaccountability, free stuff and head starts with everything have done absolutely nothing.  They are worse now than they’ve ever been.  Maybe, just maybe their genetic makeup and under-developed frontal lobe leads to low impulse control and the inability to delay gratification.  Their propensity for violence is caused by lineage of low iq.

        To add to Jordan Peterson becoming flummoxed on stage, the audience member asked him about Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s book “200 Years Together”, which is a criticism of the J’s.  Peterson is a huge Solzhenitsyn fan, but given the subject of the book, after a period of silence, walking back and forth on stage, and some hemming and hawing, he finally announced, “I can’t do it.”

                That doesn’t sound likeSolzhenitsyn, but it is the kind of thing a prominent Russian would say. (A normal one wouldn’t.)A reason Russia was chosen for revolution/conquest was because the pre-Soviet empire was multicultural, a proto-globohomo. Putin’s imperial vision isthat, a nation- and people-erasing dominion that isn’t so gay, ugly, and stupid. Claims that he wants to restore the USSR are sort of right. He’s boomer nostalgist “old left,” Eastern division.He definitely confuses our guys. He’d gulag us all for being racists. His enemies list is 80% identical to Nuland’s. “Our” hostility baffles him. /our/ support disgusts him. Solzhenitsyn would see us and “us” both more clearly. He definitely wouldn’t give that quotenow.

                        I don’t buy the takes about Russia being a multicultural proto-globohomo, at least through the liberal lens as Z mentions. Russia spans 11 time zones from Europe to Asia so yes they are going to contain many different ethnic and cultural groups. The West’s version of multiculturalism is mashing as many disparate groups of people together to foster some impossible dream of equality. Russia is a federation, all their disparate groups have their own oblasts (Chechens have Chechnya, Buryats have Buryatia, ect) in which they are given sovereignty as long as they aren’t causing problems for the Federation as a whole.  Russia has a much more realistic system to deal with their multiculturalism, which is a result of their globe spanning geography, as opposed to the US where it is a result of their malice towards White Americans.

                            There isde factomulticulti and ideological multiculti. The former, which is what exists in Russia, simply accepts that there are different cultural groups under the same political umbrella, and that practical measures be undertaken to ensure that the various groups get along as well as possible.The latter, which reigns supreme in AINO, the anglosphere and most of Europe, argues that all cultures are equal and that all should share equally in power, wealth and culture, as well as historical valuation. Effectively, this means demoting white culture and artifically elavating non-white cultures. It also entails radical redistribution of wealth and cultural-historical esteem. This process naturally creates enmity and pits various groups against one another. Most importantly, it seeks to enrage PoC and use them as an army to conquer and subjugates whites.

                    Lots of downvotes. What was so wrong with what Hemid wrote? It sounds pretty accurate to me.
I’m not sure how multicultural pre-revolution Russia was percentage-wise, but there was certainly a sufficient number of those who wanted to take control of the Russian people from the monarchy. Many of their leaders were not traditional Russians.

            To avoid being double-secret cancelled, a lot of public figures tiptoe very carefully around certain subjects. Scott Adams, for example, argues that the problem with DIE is that it limits the candidate pool, inevitably excluding more-qualified candidates. For decades, that has been the standard libertarian argument against racial discrimination. It’s valid but it prudently avoids noticing the elephant in the living room.

                        I have found myself warning entertainment YouTubers not to play around with the JQ in their comments sections. These people are not culture warriors, just normal people with something big to lose if they even play at the edges of it. To see them get wiped out for no immediate gain just seems foolish. The cracks are forming and the West will have deal at some point. There will be a someday, it’s just not today.

                I think you’ve identified the answer. Scott is a rhetorician, and his goal is persuasion. If you “go there” with a forbidden belief, your listeners’ minds immediately shut down and you can’t persuade them of anything. Scott gets away with being noticing-adjacent but doesn’t want to cross the line.

                    Western society carefully trains everyone to have a base emotional reaction to the JQ. They are strong emotions that bypass logical thinking entirely. They are sorts of exile/shame/disgust reactions previously reserved for single mothers, homosexuals and the like.Nobody knows why the Jews are supposedly helpless victims for all of history. They don’t know why observing even the mildest of criticism of them as Jews makes one clearly bent on mass murder. They just know that everyone accepts it as true. Therefore it is true and the shaming/exile emotions kick in.It takes time and deliberate will to undo the sort of emotions that the West simply takes for granted about the Jewish people. It will take the death of generations, although I have some hope for Gen Z and Gen Alpha on that regard.

                        I’ve been lightly trying to reframe the Old Testament / Torah for people to hopefully open some eyes.  Here’s an example:Recall how the Israelites usurped power in Egypt, eventually killing a bunch of Egyptian babies and making off with all the wealth of Egypt, to then seek out their next victim, the people of Palestine, who they slaughtered wholesale because they wouldn’t get off their “promised land”.And somehow they spun this into a victim narrative. They are very good at that.Exodus 12:35-36:The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. The Lord had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.

                            Meh.If you believe the story, it wasn’t the Israelites doing it, but rather God, who is assumed in Christian circles to be perfect; perfect mercy, perfect justice, etc.
No problem if you don’t want to be Christian (I’m not, though I consider myself a follower of Christ) but this line of argument doesn’t convince anyone but the low-information types.

“Animals have a special hostility toward other members of their species who are non-kin and therefore genetic competitors. A lot of human behavior simply puts a thin intellectual varnish on top of these biological reactions to ‘explain’ why they are the way they are.”

        In my professional life, I was largely surrounded by high IQ white guys in jobs that required you to be a realist. Luckily, physics, math, and material science is boring as hell to most folks and societal sophistry was as rare as hen’s teeth. And when it did find its way into the room, it was usually met with blank stares of incredulity. Unbeknownst to the offender, they were silently categorized as a system defect. And our job was to eliminate such defects because if failure occurred, important things broke or innocent people died. This principle applies broadly.

                    I took his advice to be translated as, ‘you can’t learn from people dumber than yourself, therefore avoid them and find the smart people to learn from…’
I never considered that the smarter guys would not wish to be in the same room as me.  So there is that.  I suppose there is a balance somewhere.  In any event, one then must say I’ve been blessed to have the tutorage of brighter minds than myself in my career.

If the Bs want to learn from you, they have to make the effort. Not that you can’t offer yourself to that task, but if you dedicate your life to Bs, you will fail to achieve your potential A-dom.

        Progressivism (called communism or liberalism or wokeism by your normie cousin) is a completely insane lie. Either that, or it’s a form of kayfabe for people who know better but don’t care (this is the bourgeois Bobo who watches MSNBC because it’s their version of wrestling.) To be fair, lots of religions are objectively insane, and wrestling is diverting in a low theater way, if you’re into that.Worse than progressivism (communism, liberalism, wokeism) is mainstream conservatism. This is much more pernicious because it not only claims to offer an alternative when it doesn’t, but offers a solution, usually for a price and a subscription. Included in this category is everything from Sky News to post-Tucker Fox News and your Dark Enlightenment grifters and self-worshippers like Moldbug. It’s a half-truth—dealing honestly sometimes with things like COVID, transgender madness, even illegal immigration. But again, it uses these to bait a trap, and always refuses to deal with these things in a way that can offer a true solution and a way out. That makes this much worse than blue-haired crazy HuffPo nonsense, which smells from a mile away. And at least the progs put Al Sharpton on MSNBC and Fetterman in the senate to let you know they’re trolls, and they think it’s all a joke, and you don’t have to waste time with it unless you want to. And since they’ve welcomed neocons (and even Dick Cheney!) back into the fold, the smell of sulfur is strong enough to let you know where they are from a mile away and it’s easy to avoid.It’s the normiecon crap that pisses me off, as it’s a time and money suck for people who should be on our side. The other day I visited with a normie cousin of mine. He’s mostly apolitical and lazy but senses things have gone disastrously wrong in America and is genuinely curious, receptive, and most important of all, pissed. And then he proceeded to show me an interview with Brett Weinstein on YouTube in which Weinstein informed the audience Kamala is secretly very intelligent and playing 4d chess. He then proceeded to go into some tangent about seeing a street performer in Vietnam who’d been mangled and tortured by the Vietcong and then began to cry. It was histrionic and inauthentic, and disgusting. I didn’t want to alienate or offend my cousin, so I sat politely and listened with him to the whole thing, but it was agony. There’s just something so insufferable about slightly heterodox people convinced of their brilliant bad boy cred who bar actual solutions by claiming they have some kind of solution. And like Sam Francis’s “beautiful losers,” the solution always involves taking the high road and letting the Left destroy you while you get to keep your principles.If we keep trying to keep our principles, though, we’re going to lose our lives.

        We are absolutely awash in sophistry. Most of our “public conversations” are little more than sophistry.  The whole purpose of modern “news” is not to inform, but to convince you of something.
Just look at the coverage of Israel/ Hezbollah, Iran and Hamas.  Everything Israel does is good and right and everything the other guys do is evil and terrorism.  Even Iran defending itself becomes an unjustified act of terrorism.  Everything is framed in such a way that “we” are always the good guys.

            Sophistry has been the central problem in political philosophy since Plato. Plato’s dialogues represent the battle between Socrates and true philosophy, and various sophists, orators, poets and other mythmakers.Plato’s solution to the problem was essentially education: the guardian class in the “just republic” would be comprised of both men and women literally bred and trained to selflessly seek the truth using the Socratic Method, and would be given total power.Of course, as Aristotle argued, human Nature prevented this from happening, and prevented the communism of men and women within the guardian class that Plato proposed. Not only was it almost impossible to identify people suitable for membership in the guardian class, but humans were always likely to seek self-interest over objective truth. Then Christianity came along and argued that The Fall made justice in this world impossible.Modernity purported to solve this problem with the Scientific Method: sophistry (and mythology) could be disproved by empiricism and by the objective testing of hypotheses. The math and the numbers would not lie, and could be easily verified by any number of people. This enabled the West to literally conquer and revolutionize the world in the 19th century.However, the postmodern West finds itself in a bizarre situation: it has so thoroughly transformed society that it has made it safe for sophistry once again. The great irony of our age is that the people who most claim the authority of “science” are the people who adhere to unexamined sophistry and mythology — i.e. that gender is “fluid,” that race does not exist, that a fetus is not human, that homosexuality is normal, that men and women are equal, that electric cars will save us from “climate change.”This has got to come to an unhappy end someday…

        I’ll take a brief stab at it before listening or checking the links, as this is a think-piece that needs to be digested:
Sophistry, here, is the right wing version of post-modernism.One must cloak the origin and intent of one’s thrust with a lot of bafflegab.
Too late, do ones like JP realize they’ve swallowed a nice-sounding draught of a poisoned chalice.  The philosophical concepts themselves were were a dark mirror caricature from a foreign mind, and too late do the Petersons realize they’ve signed up with the wrong team.

        Since Z spends a fair amount of the podcast discussing Strauss and whether Strauss was pro- or anti- sophist, and discusses his seeming ambiguity, I’d like to weigh in on that topic a bit.Strauss understood that the fundamental problem for the political philosopher (or any philosopher, really) is that he was going to end up contradicting the cave-myths, (which are are, essentially, politics and religion).As Socrates says in the discussion of the cave inThe Republic, if the philosopher escapes the chains of the cave, goes out into the sunlight and sees reality, and were to re-enter the cave and contradict the shadow-myths, not only would the cave denizens disbelieve him, they’d try to kill him.This of course foreshadows the trial and execution of Socrates himself.In other words, a philosopher can be 100% right — and he can get himself killed for it. If he is “dead right,” what good does he do? The truth can only be useful if it can be introduced to the cave denizens and the mythmakers in such a way that it is palatable and can start the process of slowly questioning revising the myths to be closer to the truth.Strauss’s teaching on utilizing esoteric and exoteric language strategically seems to be his answer to this problem. The philosopher must be deliberately vague enough so that his teaching does not spook the power structure into killing him, and also clever enough to get his point across to other clever people who can start slowly undermining the false cave-myths. Strauss’s teaching on Machiavelli is very important on this point. Is Machiavelliflatteringthe Prince, orcriticizinghim when he writes “It is better to be feared than loved?” The Prince himself will think that being feared is good and that Machiavelli is praising him… the average man-in-the-street might contemptuously snort “Yeah, right. That Prince reallyisan asshole, isn’t he?” (Think of the sarcastic humor used to criticize the regime in the USSR).If Strauss himself seems vague, perhaps that is deliberate… what is not ambiguous about Strauss’s teaching is that he encouraged us to go back and re-examine the Ancients, to re-read Plato, and to re-commit to the Socratic Method. Doing that in a high-minded academic sense would not get him thrown in jail or thrown out of the university, or executed in any regime… but it might prompt others to start asking the right questions.Now, of course, Strauss may have been wrong about that. The two figures in Western history most responsible for prompting a re-evaluation of the social cave myths were Socrates and Christ — and in both instances it was their deaths, not their survival as honored academics, that prompted a “revaluation of values.”Perhaps it is simply impossible to promulgate the truth without becoming a martyr for it.

            I must confess that my negative view of Strauss is primarily due to his most famous students. The neocons and Jaffa-ites both seem to come away from Strauss thinking his arguments regarding the use of esoteric language was license to promote and proliferate monstrous narratives.

                Yes. And it’s a problem that plagued Socrates himself… the Athenians developed a negative opinion of him due in part to his association with people like Alcibiades.

        Jordan Peterson is a brand in a world of competing brands. The name of the game is to get your name out there. Sites like Zman’s achieve slow, organic growth, whereas visual clips on YouTube expand virally in rapid motion. Jordan has quit his job at one of Toronto’s universities so that he can better manage his media explosion. In this he is like another YouTube product, Justin Bieber, who was discovered on YouTube by superagent Scooter.Anyone who seeks to employ solely text is wielding a rusty sword. Look at movies. In the 1930s and 1940s films were dialogue-heavy and plot-driven. By the time of the age of Michael Bay, it’s all eye candy with a grunt here or there. The written word becomes an exotic, soon-to-be extinct bird.Maybe the answer is a marriage of text and video. Kind of like a cyberbook with moving pictures. If that’s the case, the future background of all political sites will look like Star Wars Episode 3 where the chancellor is bound in a steel chair and star fighters are laser-dueling behind him.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            Also, it needs to be said, Jordan Peterson is insane. Vox Day was on top of this before anyone. I remember getting into arguments with people after the whole cider thing – where he claimed he didn’t sleep for a month after he had a glass of cider – and said nobody should be taking advice from this guy, on anything. The counter was, well, clean your room or whatever is good advice. Okay, but do you need a crazy person to tell you to clean your room?So, it’s really not just about being a brand, but there is a vetting process, a gatekeeping process, that involves who knows what but look at the people it lets through. We are starting to learn what bieber went through after he was plucked by Scooter Braun. Taylor Swift was plucked by the same guy. Etc.

                JP is anything, but insane. Why is it so human in nature to decry our betters. Anyone following JP knows he is a sharp guy who has stood up to the Leftist establishment and been punished for it more than most. JP is also human and made any number of life mistakes—taking “Bennies“ for one. That he may have a weird idea now and then, is nothing out of the ordinary for influential figures. The stress he’s endured would break most men.
If JP is insane, name someone influential as JP who is not insane?

            I thought I made that clear. The “Q” of the “JQ” is not why Jews have done so well in America. That has been answered. I often recommend the book The Jewish Century for this reason. It pretty much covers the that topic. The “Q” that remains unanswered is if having an unassimilated minority in positions of power is workable. I am old enough to remember when Jewish intellectuals debated this exact question, but that was long ago in a foreign land.That said, I doubt it remains a question for much longer. Diaspora demographics will make the question moot in a generation or two. Fifty years from now when Americans think of Jews the image that will come to mind is those ultra-orthodox enclaves everyone politely ignores.

                Respectfully, I disagree. People have been writing off the Jews since the Merneptah Stele. Fewer numbers only concentrates their power. They cracked the code. The key is nepotistic control of the institutions. Fewer Rothschilds only means greater influence for those that remain.

                    Maybe. I do not think Jews will disappear. I think the diaspora will whither in both relative numbers and in influence. The main reason is Jews are getting dumber at a much faster rate the rest of the population. They are facing a collapse in general IQ.

                        “They are facing a collapse in general IQ.”Yes, ironically it’s in part because the Jews drank their own kool-aid first. Many of the mulattos that people see in the news are the children of a Jewish mixed couple.  It seems became fashionable even, rather than just a way to make Dad upset before settling down to a real marriage.Hollywood is an easy place to see it. There’s Amandla Steinberg, who I had to keep reminding myself was half black because I listened to podcasts, rather than keep seeing her face. There’s Rachel Ziegler. I’m guessing Pedro Pascal is also half Jewish. If there someone of a clearly mixed race, who can maybe pass for white in the right lighting, clothes, and make up, and appears to have no talent what so ever, it will be a half Jewish child. Also if they appear to be getting roles for no reason at all.

                                In my experience growing up in a famous NYC suburb, late 50s early 60s high school grad, there were lots of smart Js in my class of under 100, but there were also some real dummies who cared more about their sports cars than they did about getting into Northwestern. Later in life I noticed how the guys could not resist the cute Waspy blondes who did not need nose jobs. Later, watching my kids in their private school, 90s grads, filled with J kids, I was really not impressed with their output. I agree that IQs for all elite offspring are dropping. I think it has to do with the lack of pressure on recent generations to “prove” their worth. Everyone is “elite” these days!

Bingo!  Assortive mating via college dating breaks down when over half the attendees are of average IQ.  This of course will take a few generations to detect, but the theory is sound.

                                    Later in life I noticed how the guys could not resist the cute Waspy blondes who did not need nose jobs.
Jews as a whole, not just the less academically-inclined, seem to be particularly fixated on blondes, though. And blonde women apparently have a small but non-negligible advantage in IQ over other women.

                        “I think the diaspora will whither in both relative numbers and in influence.”I agree with this assessment, given the assumption that there is no replenishment. However, if there is diasporic replenishment it will be in FUSA …I wonder if Netanyahu is deliberately pushing a ‘go long or go home’ scenario, given the context of the impending destruction of the International-Jew colonial state of Ukraine. That is to say, he is attempting a radical change of the demographic landscape surrounding the current borders of Israel in the full knowledge of poor Jewish demographic projections inside Israel, knowing that in the not unlikely event it fails, Israel will become inviable and with Ukraine no longer available most will flee to the (formerly) United States.Both factions of the International Jews (communist and corporatist), between them, own our Congress. Israelis WILL be let in no matter what Americans think, and with their numbers doubled and too many Americans brainwashed into mindless obeisance, Jews will be in an excellent position to carve out a new country in North America after the dissolution of the current American Empire, complete with useful white slaves every bit as stupid and obedient as Ukrainians. I hope this does not come to pass, because our descendants will have a better chance at a decent life under the rule of Mexican drug cartels than under these people.

                        Jews are being pushed out of power by the diverse. There are only so many Harvard and Yale student positions available, same with Penn. That’s why the Penn student leader against Jews was a Filipina, the daughter of some TV billionaire in the Philippines, her mother some big shot lawyer there. Not Muslim, and not concerned really with events in Gaza (not her people). Just pushing out rivals.Dudes like Bill Ackman, Jamie Dimon, Ray Dalio, and others can see this happening. Today, Harvard. Tomorrow, them.The “gutter religion” of Diversity makes holy sacred non-White people the arbiters of everything, and they can see they have been defined by those who decide (non-Whites) as indeed, White. Which is the worst thing anyone can be.I don’t disagree about the out-marrying and declining IQ as a result, but I think the desire by the holy sacred Diverse  to take the power, positions, and influence of Jews will be decisive in the next few years.

                        I can attest to this with a real example:Patriarch born in the 1920’s, starts finance company with brother which expands and then they buy a bank. Brilliant man with a net worth in the 8 figures.  Patriarch has 3 Children in the 50’s/early 60’s; son 1 becomes a lawyer, son 2 gets into banking and eventually gets placed as high ranking executive in Patriarch’s new bank venture. daughter 1 becomes a liberal activist.  Children start having their own children in the 90’s/early 00’s. Son 1 has 2 children who work random, lowly jobs as they are trust fund babies. Son 2 has no progeny. Daughter 1 has 2 children who work random, lowly jobs as they are trust fund babies. None of the kids are even involved in any way with the family business, let alone serious studies in college.  In 3 generations, the dynasty will have been created and dissolved. It is truly remarkable.

                “The “Q” that remains unanswered is if having an unassimilated minority in positions of power is workable.”
Or maybe whether having positions with that much power is even a good idea. The last few years have made it pretty plain that no one can be trusted with it.

We are run as olicharachy by anonymous committee, which is why we’re allowed to vote at all. It does not matter.We can accept a flawed ruling class as having God’s OK to rule over us. That ruling class will all be sinners, but if we’re lucky they may care about the people. OR we can pretend we run ourselves and still get ruled over anyway. Except as now, we don’t know their names or faces.

                                It’s not just that. Corporations are a legal fiction, a creation of government. It’s in the word. To make corporeal. To form into a body. In at least some states, the act of filing the paperwork with the Secretary of State is considered breathing life into the body. The corporate form would not exist if government didn’t make up “laws” to enable it, and arrange the legal codes to protect it and give it preferential treatment.

                                    To extend a bit, the gist of incorporation is that you hold the “person” created out of thin air to “embody” the group that is the corporation responsible for most misdeeds that group commits. Yes, exceed a certain limit and the officers or principals get in trouble, c.f., Enron, but most misdeeds are a fine only.
The “person” who “embodies” the corporation cannot ever die, being a figment of ones imagination. So they are completely immune to death tax, which often destroys non-incorporated entities.
Since “by their fruits ye shall know them”, any product of the State is likely evil.

                “Diaspora demographics will make the question moot in a generation or two.”
It appears that mulatto Jews, of which there is a surprising number, are not fully on board with Jewish interests,. “Look Who is Coming to Dinner” apparently was just a movie about Jews post WWII. Given what I see in Hollywood, the mulattos will gladly take the benefits of Jewish privilege. Then they will be mediocre in in their personal efforts and actively side with their other heritage on any question pertaining to preserving Jewish privilege.

                    Jewishness, rightly or wrongly, retains the taint of whiteness in the Western world. It is only logical then, that Jewlattos renounce their Jewishness and flee pell-mell into the dusky camp. They know which way the wind blows.

                    If by diaspora Jews, we mean those who marry outside the religion and cease to practice, then that’s not—or was not—a problem centuries ago.  It was a feature of burning off the worst of the tribe.  It was the secret to the group obtaining/developing their higher IQ and ethnocentrism.  No different than dog breeders perfecting their particular sub-species.  This behavior was unfortunately reinforced through societal discrimination and ghettoization, until the 1800’s.  Then the prohibitions lapsed in the West and a plague was released.Today, “out breeding” is perhaps the Jews worst enemy, unless you are of an ultra orthodox sect.  Who by the way, are growing and expanding both here and in Israel.  They self select via their complete strangeness to all other cultures in their dress, mannerisms, and intense shunning of any that stray from the fold.

        What initially comes to mind about sophists is they were place/people/culture specific. They were cultural relativists. What’s good for Athens may not be good for Thebes .i guess it depends on the issue.they also were kind of a necessary transition from a philosophy that was so lofty and abstract to what they the sophists, were promoting , which was a overly down to earth philosophy of what’s good for me now where I am.in a way our side is kinda doing that, and I’m not criticizing. Liberal democracy is a political philosophy which is suppose to apply to purple haired costal women and purple fingered Iraqis cause we are all one race etc.so in a way, we may need to be sophists. They seemed to play to win not for an trans civilization outlook where you make sure your children drink the hemlock before you do

            Things are clearer at the margins, positions are easier to argue. You get a dialectic. Left/right, woman/man, sophist/philosopher, practical/abstract. Imo, the best position is somewhere in the murky middle. Finding the middle by letting the extremes duke it out is retarded. It’s learning strictly by failing.

Yes but if you want to have a large number of human beings, that is the only way that a large number of them can learn.  They can’t visualize a few steps after a decision is made.  That is why arguing with them is pointless.  Hence they must step on the rake and have it smack them in the face.

                    There’s this discredited thing called eugenics. Quality over quantity. Now we rely solely on education to improve the masses, which doesn’t work, so we manage the masses while pretending it does. Even Plato understood this.
If we actually let people fail, it might have a eugenic effect. Playing God is evil, handing out Darwin awards is evil, but the race to the lowest common denominator is good  🤷‍♂️

                                Gregory Clark’s research, as presented in “The Son Also Rises” and his earlier book “A Farewell to Alms”, produced strong evidence that, if lessor ability individuals are left to their own devices, they will be out bred by greater ability individuals.This finding explains the reason for the rise of society such that the Industrial Revolution occurred at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 19th century.  In short, an explanation of the power of eugenics in shaping today’s society.Conversely it also provides an understanding of why we are getting dumber in the 20th and 21st centuries as the IR begot the Welfare State which prevented strict/harsh Darwinian Selection among humans.  Without a replacement for DS, we will be destined to revert to medieval ability among the populace.As far as who will “be allowed” to reproduce, it will mean little if the phenomenon of the best and brightest continue to refrain from reproduction in a post IR bountiful society.

        Hope I’m getting this right, iirc a sophist was someone who was wise, and a philosopher was someone who loved wisdom. Always found that funny. Why didn’t the philosophers love the sophists?
I know, too cute, they had different notions of wisdom, which is also kind of funny. Arguing over the meaning of a word, when you get down to it.
Later on, you get Sophia. Now this wisdom thing is feminine. Everybody wants a piece of the action. Just sayin’, just sayin’!

        In the ancient world, Sophistry had a somewhat positive connotation, at least before Socrates. The Sophists were the original post-modernists, pointing out the inconsistencies in all postulates (anticipating Gödel, in a way), and then congratulating themselves on their own cleverness. It was left to Socrates (through Plato) to point out that knowledge cannot advance in face of such juvenile obstructionism.A good modern example would be the dweeb who Fuentes debated the other night. He reminds me of Chris Matthews. He talks fast, talks over people, sets up hypothetical traps, and then immediately pivots when he gets caught out. An insufferable little prick.Of course, it was Andrew Tate who shut him down: “No chicks at the table”. Hysterical.Regarding Fuentes (and I say this through slightly gritted teeth), he is the next Rush Limbaugh, in that the man and the medium are perfectly aligned. He is smart, funny and a master of the format.Also (teeth even more gritted), women love him, in the same way the love charismatic priests and queers (yeah, I know) who are similarly unattainable.I now why Musk lets him continue, despite keeping others with essentially the same views banned.Fuentes is just that good.

        Any of you guys see “am I a racist”? I did. I feel that Walsh needed to attack the higher hanging fruit.

        A food bucket is something you buy to await TEOTWAWKI.
A meat bucket is something you date, and possibly marry if you’re silly enough 😆

        It is always delicate to dance around certain awkward questions. But to watch the dance from the sidelines can be ….interesting.What are the sidelines of political debate in North America? As the hiding places of unpopular thought, they are found in marginalized locales. The South. Appalachia. The Rust Belt. And those in California who cannot afford to buy a home. Driven to despair by life’s circumstances, they put aside rose-colored 🌹 glasses in order to see clearly through the murk, their questions unanswered by the media and the political elite. These sidelines fester like open wounds, breeding the pestilence of Truth which cannot touch the germ-free suburbs and exurbs.It is in the largely white suburbs that the battlegrounds of the future will be drawn. When there is no escaping political questions, issues get resolved quickly anddecisively.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
