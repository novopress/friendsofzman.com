        We had been living outside the US before the Clinton campaign. Upon our return, I realized he was going to win. Having been gone for 5 years, I could see the cultural shift more clearly than those inured to it. After his first SOTU speech (interminable) I turned to my hub and said, “He’ll be re-elected.”
While I believe the same idea of shift is upon us, I no longer believe the voting booth is trustworthy. I think there are enormous and unseen hands that will have what they will have. If not this year, soon.

        Here’s a guess, for what it’s worth:  The Government Party vs. everybody else.For reasons that you’ve outlined over the last few weeks, the traditional parties are toast.  Ambitious men don’t need them anymore.But there’s one national interest left, and it’s a big one: those who work for the government or those who want something from the government, whether that be 0bamaphones, or lucrative contracts, or access, or enforcement of their ideology.  These groups will coalesce to keep the gravy flowing and the rest of us in line.There are more of us, but we have little in common, except our dislike of the cronyism and corruption and bullying of the Government Party.  Is that enough to unite us in opposition?  Probably not, or at least not most of the time. But it all depends on how oppressive the Government Party becomes.  And it will become more oppressive over time, because that’s what it does.

        It’s quite amusing and disconcerting to see the ‘Gelicals get behind Trump. I don’t care anymore, but in observing, it seems more of a revolt than endorsement. They’re just sick of rollovers in DC.

It appears that one Donald J. Trump is emerging as the Grey Champion of our era.

            Have you read “Generations” by William Strauss and Neil Howe? It’s one of my favorite books; totally changed the way I look at history.

        Since you seem to be an Asimov fan, consider Trump as the Mule.

        For what it is worth it occurs to me that a lot of voting is not for one particular person, but against what the alternative is.
I have genuinely no idea if Trump is the answer, but if the question is “do you want this or that to preside over America?” then the this might be a better fit for some people than the that they have seen before, but the majority certainly don’t care for the that again in any shape or form and so the this is, perhaps regretfully, moderately acceptable.
