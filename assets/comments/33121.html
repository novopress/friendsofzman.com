        The high trust society concept needs a much broader discussion.  When I bring it up to normies most of them have never heard the term or ever contemplated it before. The high trust society had reached a point where it was completely taken for granted and people lost sight of what made it possible in the first place.  These discussions need to happen in order to bring it back.

What can you expect from guys whose most momentous decision is whether to buy Maker’s Mark or Woodford Reserve for the big game?

            Yes. The Greek virtues were skill in battle and wise, articulate counsel. The latter required rhetorical skills. But what kept things under control was the possibility you’d have to back up your words with steel. If Frum and his ilk could be called out for a little swordplay at dawn, the country would be in better shape. At a minimum, they would have to go fight in the wars they’re always instigating.

            There are small anecdotal examples that hint at a high-trust society. Like the fruit and vegetables stalls in rural areas along the road. People just put stuff for sale there with a box. The idea is you pick up what you want and drop the money in the box. In our society, the stall is cleaned out the first time a vibrant drives past. Then he posts about it on instagram and the horde descends to clean out the entire area. No more stall.Something even simpler, though, would you feel totally and 100% comfortable leaving your door unlocked at night? Now this is tricky because shitlibs in city areas would just lie and say yes to make a point, but this is the basic gist of it. To be sure, many people of many different ancestries could neverconceiveof a world so high trust and so safe that people could do this. It really is a Northern European thing (and maybe East Asian). So the idea of a high trust society falls on a lot of deaf ears.

                I have no experience re China, but no one in Singapore left their doors unlocked.  And people I knew who’d lived in Taiwan and Bangkok said the same – and I’m speaking of locals, not expats/diplomats.Fwiw, a neighbor has always left his door unlocked and continues to do so, even when away for a week.  We have not followed suit, and continue to lock our doors.  High trust may work in the middle of the woods, but I don’t believe those in the closest small town leave their doors unlocked, although the problem isn’t diversity so much as it is drugs.

                    Singapore is a multicultural hellhole, it just functions and is nice because they are high IQ Asians and it is run as a totalitarian police state. But no, someone telling me Singapore is low trust is not that surprising. In any case it’s a broad example.

                    I have some experience in China. Walking around you’d think there was African-tier lawlessness…bars on all the apartment windows. Even high up. Doors locked and manned at all times. Security guards everywhere. Yet, you see young women wandering around late at night without escorts. Unless you’re looking for trouble, China is incredibly safe.It’s a little baffling, but I think it’s similar to a rural white culture of safety. Their communities are often very safe, with strong bonds, yet they are armed to the teeth and constantly watching out for strangers. More than a lefty who lives within earshot of Chicago’s south side, a white hillbilly thinks he’ll be under attack at any moment. Chinese have that mindset.

                        This is correct. Property theft is a thing and is what all the security guards, etc. are there to prevent. Same goes for Hong Kong.The thing with East Asia is that being rather more evolved (sorry, just the facts) and higher mean IQ (albeit with tighter SD) they’re less prone to random violence and acts of criminal stupidity. More crime is white collar. Women *can* and do walk the streets safely at all times of day and night. People live in high rise apartments in close proximity to tens of thousands of other people and don’t go ape shit a la Rat Utopia Experiment. And no that doesn’t mean they’re all hive-minded yellow bug people. It works for them. Wouldn’t work for us.The PRC was a lot more lawless in the early 90s during the Deng Era economic gold rush — Shenzhen had more than a bit of Wild East vibe back then. Nowadays egregious violent crime is mainly mentally ill people cracking and going on rampages. Bad one in Zhuhai recently when a guy killed a bunch of people with an SUV.I have some experience in Jakarta and Bangkok. The deal in Jakarta is that while it seems like a huge sprawling city, actually it’s not. It’s an agglomeration of stick-together residential neighbourhoods. Each of which carefully scrutinises who goes in and out and has its own organic security setup — in less wealthy areas the homeowners do it themselves. Wander into a place you don’t belong and you will be watched. Get up to mischief and you will face summary justice. Used to be that pickpockets preferred plying their trade in malls because worst could happen was mall security would take them out the back and beat them half to death. Try that in a public street market and you’d be lucky to just get a can of gas poured over your head and a Bic lighter flick.As for Bangkok and Thailand in general, seems that there’s a security guard uniform available for every male in range 70 &lt; IQ &lt;= 85. Can’t figure out what most of them actually *do* but it keeps people employed and stops opportunistic theft and loitering.

                    I know from experience that many or most people in small towns in the north and midwest left their doors unlocked, and in many cases, keys in the ignition up through the 1960’s. I assume that practice ended soon after but I wasn’t there to see.I don’t believe discussion (talk) will ever bring back a high trust society. Neither did Kirk, or does as I will imprudently claim, Zman. Only the coming of a Black Swan would make positive demographic or geological change possible (if it doesn’t make things worse). Anglo-Saxons, and to a somewhat lesser extent Europeans, are a very peculiar group compared to all others, including Han Chinese. We are capable of believing everyone is alike when no other people are even capable of thinking that. The peculiarities that once guided our ascent are guiding our descent, greatly encouraged but not initiated by God’s chosen. The French Revolution was entirely the fault of the French.

                In AINO, the door lock itself is a lie, as the majority of locks, and the majority of doors (residential I mean), are easily overcome by anyone who is not afraid to break something. I have seen sturdier doors and locks be the norm in some other countries.

                    Regardless, that small impediment will deter a certain percentage of burglars. Conversely, leaving a door wide open would attract them. The tougher you make it on them, the more likely they’ll head on down the road to an easier mark.

                    Exactly.  Locks only keep the honest people out.  Their only use is at night to maybe give you some time/warning of a home invasion.

                Even in deep red areas social trust has been damaged.  The two main contributors to it historically have been Christian religious beliefs and the social stigma that would come with violating it.  Essentially, fear of God or fear of social/legal punishment. At Thanksgiving I was talking to a relative who lives in a rural county that went over 80% for Trump.  He owns pasture land and says the few home owners have been dealing with theft/break ins on their properties.  This was unheard of a generation ago, people would have left their doors unlocked, keys in their cars, etc.  I suspect drug use is a factor, but the cultural rot is there even in areas people think of as good.

            It has been noted hereabouts that these people must taste their own blood before they realize that the bad whites mean business.
I would take this a step further and suggest that it comes down to whether people like Frum taste the blood of their own children, or yours.

Well,The Atlanticis now a publication of the Jewish elite. (Perhaps they ought to change the masthead toThe Eastern Mediterranean, LOL?)

            The Atlantic is now owned by Steve Jobs’ widow. She is most definitely not Jewish. Yes she has left Jeffrey Goldberg in place, and yes The Atlantic’s messaging is obvious, but let’s just be real here about what is going on.

                Sigh.How many times we gotta post this, dude?“Goldberg is Jewish and was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Ellen and Daniel Goldberg. Goldberg has described his parents as “very left-wing.” His grandfather was from the shtetl of Leova, Moldova. He grew up in suburban Malverne on Long Island, a predominately Catholic neighborhood which he once described as “a wasteland of Irish pogromists.” Retroactively, when describing his first trip to Israel as a teen, Goldberg recalled the sense of empowerment he felt Israel embodied.Goldberg attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he was editor-in-chief of The Daily Pennsylvanian. While at Penn he worked at the Hillel kitchen serving lunch to students. He left college to move to Israel, where he served in the Israel Defense Forces during the First Intifada as a prison guard at Ktzi’ot Prison, a prison camp set up to hold arrested Palestinian participants in the uprising…”Jeffrey Goldberg – Wikipedia

            Their behavioral patterns have worked for them for thousands of years, except when they didn’t. The Holocaust was neither the first nor the worst. Three great wars saw their organized civilization destroyed during the Roman era, AD 66-71 Jewish War (Josephus), AD116 war (Miriam Pucci Ben Zeev), and ~AD135 Bar Kochba war. Modern Ashkenazi are descended from the handful of survivors living on the edge of other people’s civilizations who ended up having to take gentile wives to repopulate. If you can’t learn from that, you can’t learn from anything. They aren’t going to assimilate (change).When I was a boy I had an ant farm with large black carpenter ants. I impulsively put fire ants in the top one day. I was horrified when the much smaller red ants systematically hunted the carpenters down and dismembered them. The carpenters tried to fill in the tunnels but the reds just dug through until there was no place left to run.There was no sapience present: just competing clashing biological programs of genetically-coded behavior (instinct). Most of our human behaviors are subsapient as well, with the capability for sapience grafted on top of the underlying subsapient neural architecture.We are the carpenter ants now. If we don’t exercise some higher sapience we will be eaten.

                The term confabulation applies to the phenomenon of people who “fill in” parts of their memories that they can’t recall due to brain damage or disease. They may know what they did but can’t really remember why so the brain invents a story or even some false memories to construct a holistic narrative. I think a lot of human culture is actually that. People act on instinct and then invent reasons for the actions retro-actively.The example that always comes to mind is the way I observed as a young man that the girls who were the most feminist were also often the most concerned with the status and income of their mates. Being the logical sort of guy, this didn’t make sense to me. They say they plan to make their own money and to not be interested in children, yet they act like they plan to get the “best” male DNA in the usual materialistic senses. Eventually I realized focusing on their feminism was my error. Feminism had simply become something girls from high socio-economic backgrounds adopted like their preference for expensive lattes, cars, handbags, and certain zip codes. They spouted the rhetoric without really understanding or believing it. It was just another way of showing that they were entitled, privileged little daddy’s girls.This realization also helped guide me to writers like Heartiste who had noticed some of the same things.

            Because culture is downstream from biology. The foreign tribes will never assimilate because they are a different people. You might as well ask a turtle to assimilate into eagle culture.
Yes, the majority can force a foreign people to live by the dominant culture if the majority is willing to ruthlessly enforce its rules on the foreign people. But that’s like a holding a chair over your head. You can only do it for so long.

                You don’t need to hold the chair over your head. All you need to do is grab it every once in a while and put it to good use. I have no idea how one can get to adulthood and have children of his own without understanding that it’s not the force itself that rears healthy productive children, but the usually implied promise of corrective force.

                    So, your plan is for whites to impose our culture – our biological culture – on other people forever. From now until the end of time, we force blacks to be less violent with the threat of violence. We force Asians to not grind so much. We force Jews to stop lying.
How is that possible? Even if it was, why would you want to do that other groups? Why would you want to turn whites into the Great Enforcer?
These aren’t our children. They’re someone else’s children. We shouldn’t be telling them how to live.

                    Some children – and some members of our race – merely need the hint of corrective force.  Other children and races need the guarantee of punitive force.Still others demand the force itself – again and again – and still cannot and will not conform to expected standards of behavior.  There will always be those for whom  “Pour encourager les autres” does not deter malfeasance.  That’s why there has always been a history of things like capital punishment and/or banishment.  If you’ve never had to deal with a chronically unruly teen, you have no idea of the mental and physical exhaustion that results from trying to enforce compliance.

                        My brother spent several months in Cameroon. He would watch the school kids walk home every day and described brutality as the ruling force even among six year olds.
Placing humans who have, remarkably, survived 50 or 100 thousand years unchanged in that enviroment, into an alien culture is no kindness but our goodthinkers don’t see it that way.
We would do better thinking of ourselves as the aliens and others as closer to the earth.

                            Excellent point.  In many ways, Whites truly have become ‘alien’ to common sense and common humanity.  The  hideous, idiot female who recently ‘rescued’ a bat in her school and got bitten and died from rabies was a leftist, but that’s the same motivation one sees in White women ‘adopting’ a non-White as a pet cause, regardless of the danger to themselves and their children.  And the Swedes – even now – seem not have warned their young daughters to avoid the non-White immigrants – sacrificing their own progeny on the bloody altar of diversity.  It is truly alien and utterly unnatural.

                    ” not the force itself that rears healthy productive children, but the usually implied promise of corrective force.”Kids catch onto empty threats pretty quickly. If parent proves to be erratic discipline, they will also behave erratically themselves.I have lost count of the parents that I watched bleat any number of threats at their children, and they continue on their disrespect and misbehavior, knowing fully well it’s all BS. An implied promise can do little and frankly if it’s fulfilled in wild explosive anger it makes problems worse.Real punishments for known, rational rules with plenty of chances to comply work best. What works even better is having the children grow up and discipline themselves.Thus any sane nation will not want to spend a whole lot of time worrying about fixing the problems of other nations. There’s already enough children at home.

About the only time she admitted the stark truth about gender differences. She had her place and I had mine.

                “Yes, the majority can force a foreign people to live by the dominant culture if the majority is willing to ruthlessly enforce its rules on the foreign people. But that’s like a holding a chair over your head. You can only do it for so long.”The classic case in point being the negro in America. For roughly a century–1865 to 1965–white people demanded negroes behave according to white norms and at least make an attempt to be somewhat civilized. Alas, postwar whites grew soft, indolent and diffident and removed the lid from the pressure cooker. Black Jack the Savage erupted from the pot and we’ve been coated in black, black, blackety, black primitivity ever since. And we show little inclination to shove him back into the pot.

                    Exactly. The majority can never let its guard down.
Which is why it’s an incredibly stupid system that will never work. It’s not fair to the majority or the minority. Better to separate and let people live as their biology tells them to live.

                    Weaponized Negros were not the result of softness as much as machinations by a far more dangerous tribe. And maybe I’m hitting the hopium pipe here, but there seems to be a trend toward putting them back in the pressure cooker albeit under the auspices of fairness rather than necessity. I’m shorting blackness because the fatigue is mounting.

                        On your second point, I hope you’re right, and it’s possible you are. On your first, it was a combination of postwar softness and semitic scheming, although whites were very prominent in the New Left, too. Regardless, if there were no negroes around, they couldn’t be weaponized.

                            Fair. I probably bristled at “softness” since it was more a case of powerlessness, but, yes, whites were prominent in the New Left. That group, which falls under the rubric of “Puritan,” seems to be tightening the vise on the Tribe and its Negro foot soldiers of late. Win/win.

                    Yes, but. That century of free Negoes lived in their own towns and neighborhoods whether by choice or not (not so much the crush of southern immigants into cities). An authentic middle class evolved which filled the function of rule over the unruly. I’ve spoken at length with blacks who grew up in the thirties through the fifties and they are nostolgic about that part of their lives but never wonder why.

                    “Alas, postwar whites grew soft, indolent and diffident and removed the lid from the pressure cooker.”True, but there’s more to it than that. The U.S. had no business siding with the communist USSR and involving itself in a war against Germany on the European continent. It did not go to war to save the Jews, it went to war because it was creating a global empire, in direct contradiction to its founding principles.After the war was over, it needed to create a mythos granting moral legitimacy to is actions and its war crimes. At Nuremberg it seized upon the actual, and also alleged, treatment of Jews by the Reich, and the racial laws of the Reich as justification.However, there was one problem: the U.S. defeated Nazi racism with a segregated Army, a segregated South, and had put Japanese into camps based solely on racial and ethnic characteristics.Almost immediately after the war, elites who were painfully aware of the hypocrisy began to take action. Truman desegregated the Army in 1948, and fifteen years later “civil rights” legislation, passed by the World War II generation (some of which directly violated the Constitution) basically revolutionized the U.S.The new myths created what was basically a Third Founding, in which the nation became dedicated to radical racial and ethnic and gender equality, and Hitler became a new Satan for the new Official State Religion of anti-racism in the post-Christian era.Ever since, of course, we’ve seen an orgy of self-flagellation and self-denunciation, which culminated with the Cultural Revolution-style riots and desecration of Confederate monuments in honor of St. George of Fentanyl.So it’s not just that whites got soft (although they did) it’s that an entirely new moral code was written, and an new ethos created, to justify the Global American Empire.An interesting figure in all of this was George Lincoln Rockwell. 90% of the stuff he says in this video (with the exception of the obvious trolling about Hitler) would have been considered plain common sense by 99% of American males from 1787 to 1945.By 1960, you had to be a “Nazi” to say it:George Lincoln Rockwell on Canadian TV 1965

        “people tend to believe a good story, especially one that flatters them, over objective reality.”This is a very important point. The lies that whites believe flatter them. “Immigrants want to come here because they want to be just like you” is the ultimate lie. “We have to help Israel because they’re the Western beacon in the Middle East” is another.Thankfully, the lying has become so much that even whites (or some whites) are getting wise to the con. Trust is sinking. Whites were the fertile, untouched land for low-trust groups who arrived and couldn’t believe their luck. But, like so many groups before them, they raped the land too much.

        Great column sir!I think it is important to understand that honesty/pursuit of the truth is a uniquely Christian virtue.  Anyone who has ever done business in Asia or the Middle East can attest to the fact that truth telling in those parts of the world is regarded as foolish and naïve.Tomás Martín Rosado had an excellent discussion of the importance of truth and honesty to a Christian:“The honest person is not one who tells the truth at all moments because they are too stupid or think that truth will magically make everything easy. Nor is it mere legalism or fear of punishment that makes someone truly honest. Rather, the honest person is in love with the truth.Honest people see reality for what it is. Their clear vision lets them see what is good and what goods are lacking in what they see. For them, telling the truth is not merely parroting all the things they know, but actually interacting with the world and communicating this activity to others. … Authentically honest people see and speak something of this truth, but they know enough not to think they possess the entire truth.Not only do honest people speak and see truly, but they live truly. …Honest people are first of all honest with themselves, and this overflows to the world around them.”Does anyone think that a moral degenerate like (((David Frum))) is honest with himself?

                It’s not necessarily a dishonest price. It can be, if misrepresentation is involved, but, generally not, any more than the potential worker is setting a dishonest price for his labor. He’d just prefer more than he’s willing to settle for.
I don’t see that as “dishonest”.

                        I’m talking about the kind of bargaining that goes on in markets throughout Asia.  The starting price is always inflated, often well above what most readers of this blog would consider reasonably profitable.  It’s not like selling a home or requesting a salary in America, where the market value is constantly in flux and is based on psychological factors.  I’m talking about goods for which the costs of production and procurement are consistent and known.  As a man of the West, I would find it dishonest to request $10 for an item that would sell for $2 under normal circumstances.  We call that gouging and frown upon it, even if the item in question could eventually be secured at a more reasonable price.

                Jesus of Nazareth has no particular ethnicity by Christian teaching. He’s most probably New Adam, the potential of all mankind. However, every creed is “became man”. It’s not “became Jewish”. His Jewish apostles would have been the first to discuss his ethnicity. They hardly ever mention “Son of David” other than to prove the prophecies (by his step father Joseph). Neither do most Christians through history.“Jesus is a Jew” is thoroughly a modernism, and possibly in origin from modern Jews themselves.Jesus, granted, was raised by 1st century Jewish parents, in a 1st century Jewish society. However, that is nothing like those post 70AD, thanks to the development of rabbinical Judaism.In other words, one person is not like all the others.

            If honesty is going to be used against you, then it is foolish to be honest.  There no problem lying when there is no upside to honesty, and the people/organization to whom one is lying are going to punish you for the truth.

                There is more power in truth than lies. That’s why the system punishes people for the truth. However, those consequences are usually short lived. Anyone who has found themselves ejected from a toxic situation will tell you it was for the best in the long run.
Yes, there is prudence too, so it’s not like wandering around with no filter whatsoever. However, ironically, the long term practical is with honesty and not the lies.

        It’s not a case of a lie here and there. The major achievement is to construct a whole intellectual framework of interconnected lies, so that feeble-minded dupes cannot think outside that framework. This is where the middle-brow and “upper-middle-brow” media comes in. This media is designed for people who want a conceptual framework but don’t have the intelligence or drive to see that the whole mesh is a sticky spider’s web and that to get out of it what is required is (to use a term of Thomas Kuhn) a “paradigm shift.” This sticky spider’s web is why even the governing elite “gets high on its own supply”, just as in Orwell’s “1984.” Atlantic Monthly, Harper’s, The Economist, Financial Times, NYT, WashPo  — these organs of the “upper-middle-brow” — are all bleating and braying in unison.

        Good column but Louis Freeh succeeded Sessions as FBI Director. Janet Reno was AG. That would be the Louis Freeh who gave Joe Biden’s grandkids trust $100,000so he could get business from the government.Clinton fired him ostensibly for misuse of government property; he didn’t report limo and plane rides on taxes. Sessions was disliked by FBI personnel because he pushed hard for DEI before it was called DEI so he had little institutional support. My cousin had a high position in the FBI and he told me and other white guys that if we became agents, we would likely have very limited chances for promotion.

        Lies don’t get you very far without there being lots of naive and ingenuous people who believe them. Similar to a bad movie that becomes a blockbuster, or awful music that tops the charts, there has to be a large, uncritical, unthinking, undiscerning audience. This group is a bigger problem than the liars. Politically, women’s suffrage increased their numbers dramatically, since there is no more gullible creature on God’s green earth than the white human female. In other times, norms existed whereby men provided a bulwark to protect women from their gullibility, I believe it went by terms like chivalry or patriarchy, but not anymore. God help us.

        Agreed.Maybe they have always lied – but I have never seen it this blatant before. And as for the liars themselves – good lord… they were much better at it than the clowns that dance and caper and taunt us today.David Frum is small potatoes. He is just a muppet with a jewish hand up his arse, reciting his lines. The owners of The Atlantic need to be boiled in oil and the next Inquisition should work its way up from there.You can’t run a country like this. Say what ya want – in China, when they catch corrupt officials like the Clintons and the Bidens – they get executed. Ditto for Russia. Until we are willing to do the same the slide will continue. To achieve a high trust society, terrible consequences must be imposed on those who violate it. People have to see it work too.I hope I’m wrong but I don’t think Trump is going to do it. My BS meter is starting to spike already… but whadda I know.

            From Tocqueville’s time, Francois Rene de ChateaubriandThere are fits of forgetfulness or deceit which terrify; you open your ears, you rub your eyes, not knowing whether you are awake or asleep. When the imperturbable individual to whom you owe such assertions descends from the rostrum and takes his seat impassively, you follow him with your gaze, suspended as you are, between a kind of astonishment and a sort of admiration; you are unsure whether the man has not received some authority from nature giving him the power to recreate or annihilate the truth.

Thing is, they are just engaging in the same tricks they did in 2015 – the concern trolling (this is especially true of the neocons, National Review, etc.), talking about our institutions, trying to stick a scandal on every one of Trump’s nominees, bringing in traitors and losers (like Scaramucci) to talk about Trump’s mistakes, trying to “Trump proof” the government by breaking the norms of power transfers that have existed for a long time. So this is just part of it. Of course the world is different than it was in 2015. Everyone knows the FBI is broken and the internal intelligence arm of the DNC, including and especially Trump. He’s not trying to make nice with them while they shiv him the way he did back then. Guys like Frum know this, and we know this. It’s like that old Soviet phrase about lying.

        This problem is actually worse than just politics. You cannot do engineering without the necessity of recognizing reality. No building or bridge can remain standing based upon narrative or persuasion. And yet, sadly, the creep of manufactured unreality is now infecting the hard sciences and medicine. Today, we are building evermore sophisticated iPhones, but our roads must be rebuilt every 10 years because no one in government wants to build a road like the Romans did. We cannot survive a slow remedy.

        Over at the Treehouse, a suggestion was made for Trump Day 1:Declassify everything. Only the President has that power…except, don’t hand it to the media.Instead, put it on Truth Social and X.(I’m hoping that’s what the decrepit Truth Social was made for.)Expose all the players, the plotters, and the schemes.The internet has thousands of internet sleuths as volunteers waiting for the call-up. Rather than be handed another tedious tangle of lies, the million truths would be broadcast by the people themselves.I see it as much more. A parallel society needs a kernel, a core set of ideas and beliefs around which to aggregate. What better than one generated by the people themselves? This is the true power of direct democracy, of self rule by self-derived custom. That’s how Church traditions could counter kingly tyrants: everyone knew the laws that mattered, a tyrant was merely short-lived.The kernel of MAGA, the idea itself, is a core around which a parallel society can coalesce. A segregate place with its own opportunities, taking care of our own and offering shelter, reaffirming our own sense of identity as an independent people, needs a concrete example and a banner others can flock to.Well, that banner exists: we’re Americans, sick of the erratic madness of the ruling classes. They are already seperate from us. This is so in all of the Western nations.Nothing would expose that seperateness like airing their dirty laundry. Trump should have an hundred podcasters and substackers a day lining up in the Oval Office where he can simply hand out reams and say, “there’s your assignment.” Using the alternative and social media platforms, such general knowledge will amplify itself.Tulsi, as the Director of National Intelligence, and general inspectors made seperate from the agencies they are meant to oversee, can reach into any silo and order the information. The agencies will balk- as Rumsfield said, their data is on hundreds of different types of equipment and software packages- but that’s what the DOGE computer people are built of.This shock-and-awe, this blast of sunshine before the Deep State siloes have a chance to react is available for only a short window. Some say the Reform will take generations, blah blah blah, but that leaves us with trying to play within the rule-set the criminals define. The Internet itself might not be around as we know it by that time.These are the types that say just wait for Jesus and vote harder.To heck with them. I say Revolution, not some utopian Reform. Somebody needs to go into the temple and start turning over tables. We already have the core and the army we need. We already know the laws that matter.  The followers will follow as they always have.

        If Trump were serious about cleaning up the Army, say, he could easily start the ball rolling there, by making mendacity pay and integrity count. He could convene a kind of Truth and Reconciliation Commission for the Afghanistan bugout. He could go through the command staff and ask them to explain themselves. If General So-and-So answers “I did X because I thought it was a good idea; this was my reasoning, but it turns out I was wrong,” he’s ok. If he starts hemming and hawing, though, he’s gone. Since most of them have never faced any consequences for lying — indeed most of them probably got promoted because they were skilled and frequent liars — he can purge the whole high command that way.

            The president does not need some commission to purge the military leadership. All military officers serve at his pleasure, by his appointment, and he can fire any or all of them for any reason or no reason. There could be a political price to pay, as there was for Truman, but for a one term president that shouldn’t be much of a concern.

                I know. But if he wanted to start Making Accountability Great Again, this would be a nice, public way to do it. So much of this stuff starts at the top. Around 1990 or so, the Elite started asking themselves why they bother with things like “telling the truth.” And they didn’t have an answer, so they stopped doing it. Which is why nobody bothers anymore. The people take their cues from the Elite, and if the Elite no longer care, they must bemadeto care.

        The problem we always run into is the Monty Python “Argument Clinic” problem:”That’s a lie!””No it isn’t!”&lt;repeat&gt;There are simply too many people at this point who not only accept liars like Frum, but applaud them.But I have adopted a line of questioning that seems to help.  People now realize they were lied to about COVID, the vaccines, the various ongoing wars, and recently, Hunter’s pardon.  The line of questioning, “OK, so what ELSE are they lying to you about?”You have to pick lies that are somewhat apolitical at this point.  Frum’s FBI lie isn’t a terrible one to point out, except your average person has no idea who Wray, Sessions, or Reno are.  They might have heard of Comey.  But you’re back to the problem of the Means to an End cabal.  Half this country is perfectly okay with the FBI framing innocent people for crimes.  And if that person is Trump?  Then they’re REALLY supportive.I’ve been focusing on the election results because Democrats were guaranteed a win.  “What else are they lying to you about?”Sow doubt.  The reason humans have evolved to value trust and rules is that the opposite quickly gets you killed.

        It’s partly a matter of scale. In a small society or market, dishonesty can more easily have consequences than in a large one. If Joe’s company lied to its customers, most people find out and avoid dealing with it. If Joe changes the name of his company, everyone knows it’s still run by a dishonest person.However, the situation changes in a large society or market. If Joe’s company lies to its customers, most people don’t know who is to blame. To erase the company’s bad reputation, Joe can simply change its name to one that most people won’t recognize as having anything to do with the previous dishonesty.

            There is truth in this. I grew up in a small community, a county of less than 10,000 people with a hub of 500 people in the county seatEveryone knew whom to trust and not trust, everyone knew the reputation of people and their families, a lie was not easily kept going in the public sphere and certainly a person could not start a new life based on a lie.Large cities, atomized individuals, the financialization of everything, the destruction of traditions, religion, and families creates a society easily manipulated and lied to by people whom receive no punishment for their behavior.

            In Helsinki, a city the size of Baltimore, crime is rare and people leave their bikes unlocked in front of shops. Walking home one night from the pub, I saw a couple babushkas walking home. There is crime, but it is a high trust society because no one wants to be the nail that sticks up. This used to be true in the Nordic countries, still is amongst the natives, but the importation of aliens has destroyed public trust.

                Exactly. The “small town” explanation doesn’t cut it. It’s just another form of blank-slate culture BS. Yes, culture matters, so, yes, a small-town culture will have impact on the population to a degree versus a big city, but what matters far, far more is biology.
Also, where do people think culture comes from? Ultimately, biology trumps all unless a foreign culture is imposed on a people with ruthless force.

                    There is a bit of both in this. It is very hard to be dishonest in a small community, so cities attract the dishonest, but a city of white people will always be far less dishonest than a city of Africans.

It’s problem though, to try to boil it all down to biology. The same Danes who today leave their bikes unlocked in another era were Vikings, who made dangerous long sea trips to steal  stuff. Obviously the ideas and culture running through our heads capture us as much as our biology. Both nature and nurture matter.

                        I guess that’s why I said, “Yes, culture matters . . .”
Culture is important, but biology is more important and the part of the equation that can’t be changed – at least not in a time frame that matters. I suppose if we have 1,000 years and were willing to do what it takes, that we could changes the genetics of American blacks, though 200 years of imposing our culture on them didn’t change their genetics much.

                            “Culture is important, but biology is more important”
This is other emphasis in what feels like a “toe-ma-toe, toe-mah-toe” type discussion. Biology is literally God’s problem. I agree we can’t fix it, because we can’t. If God wanted to make everyone European, He would have done that.With real borders and less visions of world peace, etc the problems of other people aren’t our problems. Then we can work on what we can control and make an environment where Europeans thrive. And blacks can figure that out for themselves, etc.

            Sort of. Before they became credential mills, licensing boards and colleges and guilds and professional associations filled that role. You knew that if a potential hire had a degree from a certain school, that school could be counted on to have trained him well. Only the best students went there, and were willing to pay a premium to become one of the best in the field.UL, Consumers Union, Better Business Bureau, Moody’s, Fitch, &amp;c. served a similar purpose, but all have suffered to some extent by grifters and guilt by association. And compounded by a plethora of regulations like EEOC hiring, civil rights investigations over imaginary things like redlining, &amp;c. It’s just safer to give an undeserved ratings boost to minority owned businesses so the feds have less reason to destroy you.So here we are.

            This is a theory I’ve also been working on and impacts the dating/marriage/birth rates as well. Simply put: urbanization inevitably leads to atomization and anonymization, which directly enable and incentivize anti-social behavior. Replacing the population with already low-trust people would accelerate this.

Who did it? Somebody. The cops don’t care to know. If they knew they wouldn’t tell you. Theydoknow.

Who’s ahead of you on it? Everybody. Nobody.Nobody is real but celebrities, politicians, media personalities. They get all the good apartments, them and their kids, cops and mob guys, guys who own a thing, a position.The guys in “I know a guy.” You and your friends are only really real—onlysomebody—when you’re talking aboutthem, siding with them. The nobodies in The Middle Of The Country—you repeat that shibboleth every day now—just don’tget it.And yet they think they can vote, live where they choose—just pick out a place and buy it—and have a nice bike.

            To look at it another way, if every corporation in a market economy lies (and they do), how does one punish the specific liar? You can’t really punish Nike by refusing to buy their shoes and transferring your patronage to Addidas, Converse and New Balance because they lie just as shamelessly and in identical ways. You’re sticking it to Baal and granting a benison to Moloch.

        Janet Reno was the Attorney General, Sessions was replaced by some interim person I think then Louis J. Freeh, a total political animal who led the charge against conservatives as militia members and violent threats.Reno was the one who gave the orders to assault the compound of the Branch Davidians even though there were sizeable amount of kids under 12 there who were by any measurement helpless innocents deserving of protection. The excuse? Agents were “tired” after the stand-off (real reason it made the FBI look bad).Lies however are innate to the system, based as it is on Gnostic secret “truths” (that are in fact lies). Gnostic heresies seem innate to Western peoples, and also East Asian ones, as they pop up again, and again in human history: the Cathars, the Taipeng Rebellion, Liberals, Jim Jones and the People’s Temple, Sendero Luminiso (nearly all White college kids or professors), arguably the Branch Davidians, the Shakers, the Mormons, Scientology, Free Masons, etc.In organized, increasingly urban societies there is no way for individuals to feel special and distinguished, save for ever increasingly narrow sports competition opportunities. This provides fertile ground for Gnostic lies about “secret knowledge” that makes the believer “better” and special and within a secret clique. Battles against that are eternal.The only way to combat lies is by arguing that the truth produces results and “by their fruits ye shall know them.” Of course very difficult in a mult-ethnic/racial society plagued by diversity, as diversity itself increases distrust even among racial / ethnic groups (there can always be a turncoat).

                Reno was a poorly closeted lesbian, and a long time political player. Which meant that politics was rotten (it did not filter her out) for a very long time. Given that she had a thirty year career as a prosecutor, this meant that by 1993 politics had been rotten at least as far back as the Kennedy Administration.Now think of what President AOC, or Stacey Abrams can accomplish.The fundamental process of political machines should be to eliminate upcoming threats of either malevolence or incompetence (both are threats to the machine as these people move up) and promote those who produce happy results not just for the machine but those clients of the machine. Arguably neither party has done the filtering job. No way someone like Reno should have been higher than a court clerk (if that); Mitt Romney should have risen only to a local county Supervisor.

                    It’s plausible that she was promoted primarily because she was a lesbian. The next D administration that came after the Clintons certainly did plenty of that. Which is a separate question from why the people of Dade County elected her 5 times.

        What that means for the reform minded is that for reform to work, Western societies must become hostile to people like David Frum.Information technology is extremely hostile to liars, no? There is widespread panic over the availability of truth or rough approximations thereof via new media. Schlomo can pay Liars of Color to put on prevaricating minstrel shows, for example, but the value of such ludicrous performances diminishes daily. The efforts to plug non-stop information that counters official lies have fallen short for the most part and exposed people and places like Starmer’s Britain as totalitarian shitholes. Only a decade ago, Americans would have thought Putin rather than tribal sociopaths such as Frum were responsible for the Ukraine war, to cite one example. People initially believed it but the lies were laid bare in short order. Another recent example was the relatively short shelf life of the Covid tyranny, which would have lasted much longer in a previous age.State violence likely will be employed to an even greater degree to suppress truth, but thus far at least it is a losing proposition, and successful censorship has proven futile. Supposedly democratic societies likely will resort more widely to the Gaza solution, wherein ethnic cleansing is not able to be outright denied but met with “so what?” It is not a recipe for long-term success but possibly the only tool available for now. In other words, the pretense of democracy may give way to the shameless open embrace of dictatorship. Then as always the question is who/whom and how to get on the better end of that equation, which for now amounts to the Puritans kicking the Judeo element to the curb, maybe for good. Can the Puritans exclusively keep on that good side of the equation, though? The democratic reality of universal information says not.

        Both Fifties and current culture were ‘democracies’.  But Fifties culture largely embraced probity and trust because it was masculine and — at popular level — Christian.  Whatever they were doing in N.Y. and goddess Columbia’s District, we weren’t into it out in the neighborhoods.Christianity, unlike e.g., Islam, places an emphasis so high on honesty and truth that its very King, Christ, is the source and embodiment of Truth, with a capital T.  Christian parents, real Christian parents, punish lying consistently, and do does the culture they populate.Likewise, masculine societies are relatively high in honesty and trust, as personal honor is a thing amongst men.  With women?  Eh not so much.  Femininity and deceit are, in some senses, synonymous.You had a Christian, masculine-oriented society.  Now you have a pagan, feminist society.  So now either the truth is a tool, or the sound of silence.

        It is strange but true that some people lie even when the truth serves their purpose. But of course some people just hate humans in general. The worst part is not human nature but that technology places far too much power in the hands of humans and therefore also in the hands of such miscreants. Will mankind see the dawn of the 22nd century? Odds are lower than they seem

        The thing about lying is that it is mainly done by those in weak positions,especiallyby children and women. Democratic society makes us more like kids and bitches as a whole — immature, bratty, vain, nasty, gossipy. It’s a vicious circle down to television’sThe View.

            Greg, you really should stab yourself in the neck with a rusty knife. It would make the world a better place.
