        I read the Rodriguez manifesto on Ron Unz’s page. It seemed very eloquent and thoughtful. While I agree that what the Israelis have done in Gaza is an atrocity and that American subservience to Israel is outrageous, I cannot imagine anything dumber, more immoral, and more counterproductive than shooting two random people who were not directly involved in the Gaza situation.It makes absolutely no sense to throw your own life away, plus the lives of two random people, when you will not change the situation one bit and to the contrary, you will provide a propaganda incident that empowers your opponents and provides sympathy for them. It is a truism of human existence that the people most responsible for perpetrating outrages (in this case Bibi, the IDF general staff and the U.S. Congress) are most insulated from the consequences. You will never get to those actually responsible. Besides that, I have no fetish for the Palestinians. While the Jews have definitely treated them barbarically, I am an advocate of John Quincy Adams’s maxim that America “is the champion and vindicator only of her own.”There seems to be a number of people on the Left in particular willing to lash out with these kinds of counterproductive acts, from the guy who self-immolated over Gaza to a whole series of assassinations and attempted assassinations over the past century plus, from Leon Czolgosz and Aleksander Berkman to Fanny Kaplan and on up.I think it says more about the narcissistic psyche of these people than it does about the political causes they ostensibly acted on.The great lesson of Christianity is that if you object to inhumane behavior, the first and most important thing most of us can do to stop it is to refuse to engage in it ourselves.

            The only thing I get mad about with regard to Israel/Palestine is that our children are being propagandized to take sides in the insane squabbles of two insane desert tribes and our corrupt politicians get enriched to allow that to happen and to allow vast amounts of American treasure to be spent on both sides of the conflict.
A guy named “Rodriguez” should never have been taught to care at all about it, no less to care to the extent that he’s willing to murder over it.
A pox on both their tribes.

                No one in the US much cared about these things until Marxist academics began screaming about it and, purely coincidentally at the same time, the US started imported millions of Muslims.
So whenever people say “both sides” it is, frankly, an admission that one is on the side of the Marxists and the Muslims pretty much because the other side is Joooooozzz.

                    You think a lot of the Marxist academics weren’t Jews? Chickens have come to roost. I say both sides are bad because both sides are bad for my people.
As to who’s “right” or “good” or “bad” in the Middle East. I don’t give a f*ck.

                        Without antisemitism, the Jews cease to exist.They are a polyglot of genetic harvesters, nomads picking up a bit of this, a bit of that, with many subclades.Here’s a cultural example: popular streamer Asmongold stated that WWII “started to stop this from happening.”However, nothing was “happening” when the war started to give them the stolen crown of World’s Greatest Sacrifice.One commenter in a Daniel Greenfield thread says,“What we call “Judaism” was invented out of whole cloth by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi (who compiled the Mishnah, 3rd century AD) and Rav Ashi (who compiled the Babylonian Talmud, 4th or 5th century AD).”Another stated, “Unz reports from genetic surveys that today’s Palestinians are the proper descendants of the Biblical Israelites, whereas today’s Jews are descendent from the Carthaginians of classical antiquity.”I wonder if there is a genetic marker for “slippery”?

                            It’s best not to get your knowledge from comment threads. The Carthaginians were Phoenicians, who were Canaanites. So you’re basically saying that Jews were the original inhabitants of the land.Which is nonsense in any event. Jews (worldwide) and Palestinian Arabs are very closely genetically related, which makes sense from several perspectives, and in turn have genetic links to (of all people) the Kurds, for some reason. The closest genetic relations of the Phoenicians are the Lebanese, which also makes sense.(Canaanite and Hebrew are virtually the same language, by the way.)Both of the rabbis the commenter you quote compiled their works from the statements of rabbis who lived for centuries before them. So it’s also nonsense to claim that they “invented” Judaism.

                                Oh, and by the way, the rabbis they cite in turn rely heavily on the Bible, you know, that old thing.

                                Well done, and thanks. Informative. I left out other related comments from the Daniel Greenfield thread.
Correct that the Jews and Arabs are Semitic kin. One married into European genelines for intelligence, the other into African lines for fecundity. Lebanese as original Phonecians, also yes.
I overdid it and lost the plot, because what we antisemites see as a discrete group is apparently not discrete at all, but operates by different genetic (and cultural) strategy.

                            Lots of the Marxists were Jews. Lots weren’t. If white Americans suffer because a lot of WASPs were Marxists, is that also “chickens coming home to roost”? Marx himself was a vicious anti-Semite. So what? The Marxists also persecuted lots of Jews, which is why, thank God, I was raised to hate Communism.

                                I see Communism as another Judaic or Semitic evangelical period, one of many; one aspect is that those who follow their cultural guidelines (such as the Aryan Benjamites who adopted the Yahweh religion and moved south to the Kingdom of Judah), fall prey to the same praxis of militantly “improving” civilization to the point of wrecking it.
One World under Communist Sharia, for instance; they didn’t need the commonly understood ‘God as King of Kings’ aspect or the Bible anymore, obsolete to modern sensibilities, and so thus have discarded it.

            I headed over to see the comments there, regret doing so (although I suppose it’s good to know these monsters are out there), and thank God that Sailer’s departure leaves me to reason to visit that cesspool. Those people heartily *approve* of the murders.
Whereas you…really don’t seem to disapprove of them. For someone who supposedly doesn’t care about what goes on in other countries, you seem quite invested in stressing how “counterproductive” and blah blah this was. So…what if it’s *pro*ductive? Is it OK to murder Jews then?

                Ah, yes. Our Hasbara troll is back, trying to entrap me with wordplay, just like the Pharisees tried to entrap Christ.I really don’t need to quote my own comment because it is right above in plain English, and you read it (so that you could parse my words) so you know damn well what it says, but here it is again, Schlomo:“I cannot imagine anything dumber,more immoral, and more counterproductive than shooting two random people who were not directly involved in the Gaza situation.”There is no possible way you can twist that into claiming that it is “OK to murder Jews” if it is “*pro*ductive” (or whatever your silly little asterisks are supposed to mean.Why don’t you just admit that you and your people have been wrong and evil for 4,000 years and convert to Christianity like Saul did on the road to Damascus?

                    Since they were attending an aid conference for Gazans, quite a few of their own saw them as traitors, so no guilt there, quite the opposite.

                    I suppose if I try to formulate an intelligent answer you’ll just cite it as more “evidence” of Jewish clever insidiousness (which is telling, I guess), so I’ll just ask why you’d expect me to adopt a religion that is based on the wild assertion that God would impregnate a woman who would bear a human/divine hybrid son. I mean, justreadthat sentence.
Yes, I saw you used the word “immoral” from the start. But then I read the rest of what you wrote. It’s still there.

                        Well, I guess that a religion that “is based on the wild assertion that God would impregnate a woman who would bear a human/divine hybrid son” is a whole lot better than a religion whose god murdered the children of Egypt and instructed his “Chosen People” to “slay both man and woman, infant and suckling.”
And I guess it’s better than a religion whose rabbis suck an infant’s foreskin off his penis with their mouths.

                            Well, you’ll get no defense of the practice from me (and of course most Jews don’t practice it), but you know full well that a foreskin can’t be “sucked off.” The practice has nothing to do with the circumcision itself, by the way.

                        Greeks would naturally respond to such a telling. Zeus, for one, was rather fond of the practice.
“A child of the holy ghost”, like “a child of the Allfather,” was Roman slang for an illegitimate. In those times, and seeing who Jesus’ physical father likely was, that sort of political talk could get your throat cut if you were in the wrong inn.

                We here at the Zman don’t fall for this dishonest sort of verbal jujitsu. Americans should approve or disapprove of the actions in the Middle East precisely as much as they do of the various factions in the Congo or the Sudan: in other words, not at all. The average American couldn’t tell you a thing about those conflicts and there’s no compelling reason why he should have to.Your repeated attempts to twist this into an obligation to “approve” or “disapprove” of any particular actions in the Middle East are just an attempt to create a moral obligation for us to care about a conflict that is none of our business.

        All I have to know about the new president of Romania is that the regime, to the cheers of the EU, literally arrested the winning candidate the last time around after invalidating the election, Russia Russia Russia. The people got the message and voted for the “correct” candidate this time. A million math prizes won’t erase that.

        These are sober, thoughtful citizens who just believe that Mother Earth would be a better place without human beings — a defensible position on strictly logical grounds.They aren’t thoughtful, they’re loony. There is exactly one species in known creation that makes conscious metaphysical judgments about what is “better.” In the absence of that species, the questions are “Better for what?” And “So what, if we’re not around to enjoy it?”The IVF clinic bomber in his manifesto video claims that he never “gave consent” to be born and that since nobody gives consent to be born, nobody should be allowed to be born.  Yes, he’s that insane. Of course, if you take that to its logical conclusion, no living thing gives consent to be born so we should wipe out all life everywhere. That’s some Marvel Supervillain stuff.The mistake we make with blatantly insane ideologies is to think you are obligated to hear them out and treat them with respect.

        Never give up the Left / Right model.  I don’t care how vogue it is to do so. By giving it up, you do a great favor to the Left.  Remember that there is a Right and Left.  Since I’ve known since my childhood, the Left is sick, evil, and weak.  Never let them forget.  The model remains.

        At the mention of the objectionable National Review, I have to note that Mark Steyn’s long battle with climate hatchetman Micheal Mann is wrapping up in Steyn’s favor.However, Steyn has received one dollar in compensation.The odiousReview, who stabbed both our Derb and Mark Steyn at the most opportune moment, will be receiving several hundred thousand dollars.Grifters gonna grift.  We don’t hate these false fronts enough.That said, here is a quote from Steyn Online’s comment section, where ourindigenously genial host is remembered quite fondly:“As I have explained many times to foreign friends, since it was explained to me by a learned man when I first came to this country, the justices of SCOTUS are not very exceptional persons. They are not even very exceptional lawyers.” ~John Derbyshire

I know Mr man had denigrated yarvin before, although I never caught why. He is kinda annoying in his mannerisms and presentation. But the snippets I heard of this are quite good. I’m sure he has some goofy beliefs but not settling for anything but an annihilation if what he calls race communism soubds about right

            Haven’t listened yet, but is that a backdoor call to eliminate white Fascism, as well?
Race communism = Maoist, such as Obama/Kamala, Black Muslims, or Mandela’s ANCEconomic communism = Marxist, war on aristocracy, financialist warfare, Green New Deal

        I got kicked out of a book club for posting this to the “land of the free “ channel. I’m stand by my choices:Is Memorial Day a good day to buy a mattressYes, Memorial Day is an excellent time to buy a mattress. Retailers often offer significant discounts during this holiday weekend, making it one of the best opportunities to purchase a new mattress.⸻🛏️Why Memorial Day Is Ideal for Mattress Shopping•Substantial Discounts: Many mattress retailers provide discounts ranging from 25% to 50% off during Memorial Day sales. Some even offer additional perks like free adjustable bases or pillows with mattress purchases.•Clearance of Older Models: Retailers often use Memorial Day sales to clear out older inventory, making room for new models. This can be an opportunity to purchase high-quality mattresses at reduced prices.•Extended Sales Periods: Many sales begin in early May and extend through the holiday weekend, allowing ample time to compare options and make informed decisions.⸻🛒Tips for Shopping During Memorial Day Mattress Sales•Start Early: Some sales begin as early as May 1st, so it’s beneficial to start shopping ahead of the holiday weekend.•Compare Online and In-Store Deals: While online retailers often offer competitive prices and free shipping, in-store shopping can provide the advantage of immediate delivery and personalized assistance.•Check Return Policies and Warranties: Ensure that the mattress comes with a satisfactory trial period and warranty terms before making a purchase.⸻In summary, Memorial Day is a prime time to purchase a mattress due to the combination of significant discounts, clearance of older models, and extended sales periods. By starting early and comparing options, you can find a mattress that suits your needs and budget.⸻
