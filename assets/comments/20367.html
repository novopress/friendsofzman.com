        ‚ÄúThey are now busy dreaming up more insane restrictions just to humiliate people.‚Äù
This. The ruling class it out for revenge against the proles who increasingly dismiss their authority. There is a substantial portion of the populace who enjoy the humiliation, too. It‚Äôs bizarre.

            While many do enjoy the humiliation, as that is what gives cucks their sense of purpose, most do not experience it as humiliation because there is no shame or loss of status. Quite the opposite. Heeding the directives of State endorsed high-status ‚Äúexperts‚Äù for the good of the People, is an act of solidarity.But either way, the proles dismissing authority is a problem for both the karens and cucks as well as the State.This has me very concerned that there is another clown shoe waiting to fall.The justification of ‚Äúcontact tracing‚Äù is already there and will be folded into the existing surveillance infrastructure while the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù social conditioning has come from seemingly nowhere to defining the moral and social framework of everyday life.We are ripe for an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù event.

                I think the ‚Äúcontact tracing‚Äù is the most ominous of the new developments. That one is truly scary.

                        Line, yes. Toggling off location services only limits overt location tracking but the regular function of cell tower communication and the rest of the built-in ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of smart phones (maps, gyro, motion, camera, etc) send and receive data constantly.The permissions aspect can be limited but not eliminated as long as the phone is on.Apps are also getting increasingly clandestine in how invasive they are in terms of data collection. Most apps and built-in features also force the issue, ie If you want it to work, you have to agree to be tracked.Most people don‚Äôt even go that far and just run around with the most sophisticated surveillance device ever created in their hand the whole time.Like everything else, the default setting is ‚Äúopt in‚Äù and to actually ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù pretty much requires abandoning the tech entirely.I am still trying to shut off all the spying my new laptop does as part of its normal default setting.It really bothers me but is also fitting of where we are in current year. Everything keeps getting more bloated, invasive, and demanding while the actual utility offers very little in return. Just like our overlords.

                        Get a PinePhone. Install Linux on it and use the hardware kill switches to turn off what you don‚Äôt need.Of course, the cell towers will still track you, but at least you will be sharing less information directly.

                        Female think is a symptom not the cause.The cause is a lack  of organization and common purpose. That  destroys society.Our society is basically childless , unmarried, irreligious, friendless atomized consumers.Despite this being tech largest generation in US history it has the lowest recorded marriage rate and despite tolerating, nay encouraging single mothers, the lowest fertility rate among fertile age women as well.Nothing else matters more than this.What this says is our  social memes are so bad no one is buying in.That must change and the future citizen must be a family man  with friends, social organization, relegation if we can manage it.This will not be easy to do but failure means no society.

Not only that but babied and pampered by the state to the point of child like behavior. American born ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù are some of the biggest children simply because they have no responsibility or accountability.
So yeah it‚Äôs annoying for you, but it‚Äôs not meant for you. It‚Äôs from the benevelant white motherly overlords to their low IQ pawns‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs no longer a white country and standards will drop accordingly.

                    I live in a heavily Mestizo area and while many enjoy looking like a bandit they think it is as stupid as we do.
Blacks feel the same way and are at best begrudgingly compliant.
They also aren‚Äôt  having children unlike back in 2007 where there was  a baby bump everywhere, now ain‚Äôt a baby in sight other than a handful of Whites and others who moved out the hinterland to afford kids.

                        they will comply anyway, so long as the free school meals (not just lunches anymore) are disbursed with gloves.fwiw among the Hispanics it is the whiter ones more scared. they do tend to look to Italy too much for their own good sometimes. Bolsonaro is an exception, and thus some white Brazilians are not scared of the virus either, fuhrerprinzip at work. however, some lefty whites that pander to the browns are also trying to impeach him. typical.on the other hand it is the darker blacks the more scared about dat spookey virus ‚Äì and the ones who tend to wear masks more often.it is true though, on average the Western POC are also more pozzed than the browns in their homelands. but, among those who move to the hinterlands, are many rural mestizos who still breed and are brought ‚Äúbefore the crops rot in the fields‚Äù. so the FuturAmish will have competition.

            The other day, while waiting for my next assignment, I saw a young mom out for a stroll pushing a baby carriage with a 3-5 year old walking along. The small child was wearing a mask, unlike his mom. I waved to the nice ldeand advised her that the little boy ‚Äì being under 10 ‚Äì did not have to wear a mask. ‚ÄúI know‚Äù, she replied, ‚ÄúHe wants to wear it.‚Äù He thinks it‚Äôs fun.‚ÄùI took this as an indication the Karens and Cucks have succeeded in acclimatizing the next generation to the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù.

        Im personally struggling not to become black pilled about America. Its one thing for the media to be filled with lies, but more and more it just looks like everything is fake. The alt right turned out to be as gullible with the media as anyone else so long as it fit their ideology and narrative. The same media that says white people are bad and deserve to be oppressed forever told them the virus would kill us all and they believed it. Gell-Mann indeed. The alt right turned out to be committed ideologues as well, more worried about narrative than anything, and surprisingly ended up sounding like bernie bros except edgy and racist. Also in trying to bridge the left-right divide is has begun to appear generally that much of what we think of as right wing is just the left wing without as many taboos.Other ‚Äúright wing‚Äù figures i wont name like a certain blogger who is more concerned with pimping his money making projects that go no where except drain his followers of money, are just using edginess to make money.Women are convincingly crying on camera about not being protected at hospitals they dont even work at, or calling face masks rape in order to get attention or troll idk. It might be funnier if we werent swirling down the drain while its happening.Perhaps someday something real will get started and be done in this country but i wont be holding my breath. I used to think Europe might be worse of than America but i think ultimately America will be worse off because of both its hyper individualist culture making it impossible to organize anything other than a shitshow, and the fact theres just too much money and power crowding everything out so that something dissident cant sprout organically.Perhaps something can change after things get worse and we get less tolerant of nonsense but it seems impossible to predict even the next 5 years so who knows.The complete crapshoot the public space has become is imo the best evidence of who our ruling class is. Its exactly the kind of confusing, over-the-top, theatrical nonsense they would thrive in. A world where exciting stories and drama drive the train rather than anything grounded in reality. It really has been amazing to watch these last 5 or so years.

            From a distance Europe seems to be in much better shape. Better demographics. A history of tribalism, i.e. you‚Äôre not just white, you‚Äôre French or Irish or German, something to rally around. Smaller countries so less distant and powerful governments. Less dominant tech companies. Eastern European countries showing how it‚Äôs done.
I‚Äôll make my stand in my land because these are my people, but our best chances are in Europe. At that point, Felix Krull might need to adopt my future grandchildren.

                I emigrated for good in January.  (If someone had told me in the 1970s that I would prefer Europe to the U.S. I would have said that they confused me with my evil twin.) I now live in the south of France.  My wife is French, so that helps.  It‚Äôs crazy at the moment with Emmanuel Macron and his lockdown but at least there‚Äôs the Rassemblement National with a quasi-realistic immigration policy.  France is, however, rapidly becoming an Afro-Arab country.  If I were a younger man, I‚Äôd consider Poland, Hungary or even Russia.  My daughter is facing some difficuot choices.

            If recent events have convinced me of anything, it‚Äôs that the vast majority of people deserve to be dominated.  The idea that even 1% of people deserve their rights enshrined in a constitution is a joke.

                My husband was criticizing me the other night for holding people slow to change or catch on in such contempt.  He‚Äôs right, of course, and intellectually I do understand that people aren‚Äôt that bright, or can only move so far so fast ‚Äì either politically or ideologically.  On a gut level, however, it drives me nuts to have to coddle people who are supposed to be independent and thinking adults.  I expect to coddle children; indeed I revel in it.

                Freedom is for a religious., homogeneous, moral  mostly rural people. We don‚Äôt have any of those traits.
As far as doing Gods will,  Christian teachings say its your job. Waiting around for others isn‚Äôt  going to work.
Just be careful, seeking power for even righteous means is fraught with peril . Not getting it as much as having it and avoiding the utopia or puritan trap is challenging.
Do what you utterly must and no more lest you fall into the trap set by the Adversary.

            The Alt Right was a case of a product getting rushed into the mass market before it was ready for public consumption. When you have fags and clowns at the forefront like Spencer, Milo, and Vox Day‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not going anywhere.But‚Ä¶ properly played, they could make an excellent bad cop playing off the dissident right‚Äôs good cop. It has been a marginally successful tactic for me when I argue with lefties. I tell them, ‚ÄúThe way you guys are acting right now justifies Trump all the way. And, if you keep going the way you are‚Ä¶ the next guy along will make a Trump look like a saint!‚Äù Most of ‚Äòem will vapour lock and you can just see the visions of goose stepping hordes and swastika banners going on in their minds.The Alt Right had a lot of great ideas.

            I just don‚Äôt see it happening. The only necks we tend to stretch are our own. Better we use them to direct our heads in different direction.
I think there needs to be a mass exodus of dirt people from cloud cities. This was happening in NJ/NY before the pandemic; now, it‚Äôs even worse.
After our migrations are as demographically significant as the movements of Mexicans, then maybe we can talk.

                The other aspect of migration that doesn‚Äôt get a lot of air time in the ‚Äòstand my ground‚Äô vs ‚Äòflight to white‚Äô debates is that the others are already migrating and have been for quite some time.What good is it to move to Boise if it is full of Portland-Seattle-SFO goodwhite progs that have fled the inevitable results of their toxic ideas?For me it (migrating) is not just about more fertile soil for my community but it is also about reinforcing those places as inhospitable to those would-be progs who are looking to cash out of bluetopias and cash-in on the dirt.Where I live, the city to the south has long held a reputation as being ‚Äútoo conservative‚Äù.Setting aside the christcuck and tradcon elements behind that rep, this reputation has been really effective in eliminating the city as an alternative for most of the garbage. But the cost of living draw is starting to change that. That‚Äôs the front line of this war of geographical attrition.While the reality is like most cities it is still far more lefty than it should be. But it is also a step in the right (heh) direction compared to the hellhole that is my current city.The virus charade has further illuminated the stark divide between these two places.So I am moving there. And when my goodwhite friends remark ‚Äúoh isn‚Äôt it super conservative down there?‚Äù, you know because abortions are not celebrated in the town square, I will tell them ‚Äúunfortunately not. But I am hoping to help change that‚Äù.

                        Future USA if there is one will have to rebuild an electoral system around preventing structural drift.Our was built when going to a different area was arduous enough to  be a cause for rebellionThat needs to be fixed.My preference is must  be 21 own property  free and clear ,  be married (no gay marriage) , have 2 children (may adopt if medically needed) and must have lived and worked in the State  for 10 years or for persons in certain jobs, be registered there (think Army here)Voting   is mandatory  and non  voters may not hold or be appointed to any office.To be sure, none of the above is also mandatory and binding, baring candidatesThis won‚Äôt stop all the creep as people from areas with high housing prices end up moving into the Hinterlands but it will slow it down tremendously.You want to take your family to Boise from Cali.  Great. You need to get acclimated to the local system first. Takes a decade.

The second option demands careful research, grit, and luck.Most of the goodwhites who go south are not looking to contaminate their sociopolitical exaltation. Badwhite city-folk, though, are a different story. So I‚Äôm looking at who‚Äôs down there as well as the surrounding counties. There will definitely be cultural issues as I learn the nuances of true southern culture; that‚Äôs okay.I think what I‚Äôm trying to say is that the affulent, goodwhite left who make the move down south take assimilation less seriously. They‚Äôre already enlightened; why change? And because they need constant reaffirmation of their moral superiority, they‚Äôll no doubt surround themselves with those who are like‚Ä¶ themselves. Wouldn‚Äôt the rural world‚Äôs ambient racism trigger their asthma?Again, I hope to avoid such people through careful research. That probably means buying land in a place more than two leftist acquaintances refer to as ‚Äúhick.‚Äù

                        Sub, yeah thats the spot. The real estate market went nuts ‚Äì especially over the past 24 months, so we were priced out of buying. Ive already bought high and sold low once. No thanks.I hope to one day make a bigger move because as rightly noted here CO is well on its way to CA status. My lady has a good job on the front range otherwise we would have punched out entirely.Infrastructure, ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù, business climate, and the damn perfect weather are real draws. Having done it myself, the CA to CO transition is about as easy as it gets. Lotsa sunshine and lower taxes and real estate positive arbitrage.But the anti-reality clowns are gaining more control every passing year and there is really no political party or even consensus among whitefolk that seems to want to put up a fight. I know Im preaching to the choir.I saw the same thing out west. Its all about making money and insulating. There is no outward stewardship other than all the polarizing western issues: water, mining, energy, guns, and ‚Äúschools‚Äù.I‚Äôve been through the CA insanity. Not inclined to do it again but CS will be an improvement, no doubt.Watching both CA and CO fall of the map has been a real tragedy. Still nothing compared to a lot of the Midwest and NE, as the economy here is strong. But that just drives the libertarian delusion that much more, effectively gatekeeping people from forming-up with pitchforks.Right now I just want to have a beer on a patio in the spring sunshine. Something that will happen in El Paso county long before Denver.

                    Basic Husband and I were talking over coffee this morning.  He informed me Any Twosome Newsom was hectoring his people that they misbehaved over the weekend by going to the beach, it was naughty and there would be consequences for their bad behavior.  Modoc and Orange County have declared they are opening businesses and screw off Newsom. We think within 3 months after the final openings, the flood gates will open and people will flee en masse from the totalitarian blue states to red states. Expect Utah will balloon up. With mostly the wrong people. This state will flip blue within 10 years and this wave will push it quicker. Already the tipping point has been reached in the Salt Lake corridor with lefty wahmyn in political control. Cedar City and St. George will receive the brunt of the Camp of Saints refugees from Nevada and California and predict Utah to flip blue within 10 years, swelling into a western blue corridor north to south.Living in cities creates a hive mentality. People are disconnected from where their food is raised. No understanding of real western/rural ranching and agricultural issues. Everything is brought to them. They are so much more dependent on the Nanny State to take care of them.  Hence demanding more gibs and hatred for those who push back on their Nanny stuff. Ironically hatred for rural folks culture while demanding they produce.  Bite the hand that feeds them.As blue state people rush in and bring the hive mentality and the disconnect from the reality of producing their stuff, the red states will begin to fail just as the blue states. As the lefties wear leather shoes, eat arugula and flash around their iPhones, they disdain the miners-ranchers-farmers that produce their stuff.http://rangemagazine.comPlease become familiar with the problems and successes of the west. These issues trickle down to you wherever you live. This forum is our ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù and the western issues are You too! Whether land grabs, water grabs, stupid fire fighting, 2nd Amendment gun rights, mining, ranching means yummy meat, how grazing herds in rotation increases quality of grasslands, and so on, these are issues that affect you.  Think beyond urban hive mentality.

                            There are still areas in the USA where ‚Äúgood whites‚Äù will never venture.  They would rather die than deal with hard core redneck natives.  Some of these areas are quite beautiful and are very inexpensive.I know a lot of people on our side have, or would like to, relocate to currently sparsely populated areas in the mountain west.  I can understand why as it is a beautiful area. However, I am worried that these areas are all eventually going the way of Colorado as more west coast lefties are also moving in.I believe Colorado now has a twink as Governor. In my mind, there is no coming back from that.

                                MA, take a look at the Appalachians, Ozarks and Smokies if you‚Äôre not sold on the West.

                                    Exile, those are precisely the areas I was referring to above.  I would also add the Ouachita Mountains of Southwest Arkansas and Southeastern Oklahoma.   This area is similar to the Ozarks, but much less developed.  The locals are still hardcore white rednecks with some Choctaw Indians mixed in on the Oklahoma side. (Although most of them are mixed and pretty assimilated in the redneck culture. )

                            I get it. People want to keep their communities nice, and that means maintaining some kind of equilibrium. Outsiders are a threat to that.
Unfortunately, though, our governor is completely insane.

Being ‚Äònice‚Äô is irrelevant. ‚ÄùFirstly, I am exempt from the ranks of these people. I do not vote and I don‚Äôt think most people are qualified to vote on most issues.(That‚Äôs the problem with this democracy shit: it enables and propagates a culture of ‚Äúniceness‚Äù that good plebs are taught to uphold. If our thoughts are constantly bombarded by state controlled media, doesn‚Äôt that taint the integrity of the public vote? Same as it ever was, I guess.)Second thing is that certain people who are high in psychological openness can and do adapt and assimilate well. They learn languages, pay taxes, buy property, raise kids. And if on top of all of that they are loyal friends to their neighbors? That satisfies me. Still, it‚Äôs true that only a small number of others would be beneficial. And even at a true minority level, they tend to vote as a block. It can make things tricky.Third, we do not deserve to suffer simply because we reside in New Jersey.  (I know, I know).The state is dreaming are dreaming if they think their current strategies will culminate in anything more than an economic shart.  Yeah, they‚Äôre fools. Maybe they‚Äôre even our fools. But that shouldn‚Äôt mean that we all have to suffer them.

                                @ Lawdog Re: ‚ÄúThe problem is that whites don‚Äôt think of themselves as a block.‚ÄùIt isn‚Äôt simply that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù think of themselves as a block ‚Äì it is that the powers-that-be have moved heaven and earth to keep that block from forming in the first place.Personally, I think identity politics is an idiotic way to run things, to structure a society ‚Äì but if that‚Äôs the system we have, then each identity group ought to be able to organize around its own common interests and work to promote them on that basis.The trouble is that the Cultural Marxists (communists) are fine with blacks, Latinos, feminists, LGBTQ, Muslims, etc. having their own blocks and interest groups but people of European ancestry a.k.a. whites? No way! We aren‚Äôt allowed that privilege.What has been constructed since the 1960s, in fact, is a variation on the old apartheid society found in the former Rhodesia and South Africa. Only this time, it is whites at the bottom ‚Äì in particular rural, Christian, conservative/traditional whites ‚Äì and everyone else above them.This reverse apartheid is held to be a positive good, since ‚Äúthe man‚Äù had it coming for all of the things that were done to POC in the past. Ahuh‚Ä¶ well, the problem with that is that people of European ancestry who are alive today did not commit those crimes, those alleged wrongs. If they occurred, they were committed by people now long dead and buried. How does punishing us for their sins make any sense whatsoever, morally or otherwise? It isn‚Äôt as if guilt can be inherited and passed down the generations‚Ä¶.All the present regime is doing is assuring that the oncoming generations of Europeans will be radicalized to hate the present status quo. Maybe that‚Äôs not what they think they‚Äôre getting, but it is probably what they will be getting ‚Äì and hard.

                            You don‚Äôt really think you can vote your way out this mess do you? I mean miracles happen but what the DR wants is not going to be given to them easily  even if they win an election.There is always some holdover judge or backstabbing cabinet member out there to engage in law-fare or sabotagePower has to be taken.That said it might be possible to use legal means like FDR did and organizing for legal political activity is the way to go.If things go hot, the better organized people will have the best chance at a  win anyway.Decide what a DR society will be like and what goals can be discussed publicly and which cannotOrganize to achieve those goals legally with the right people to do the right thingsGet it done and take as much power as you can grab again legally.Ultimately if your movement is at all done properly, you either win or if things go hot have the 10% or 20% determined core  you need for the society you want.Ecclesiastes 4:12‚ÄúAnd if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.‚Äù

The race against Tester is a good example of the libertarians messing things up, they siphon off a few percentage points every election and keep the fat turd in office. Some even drop out after many absentee ballots have been cast, happened last election, what a joke.

            That is the real parallel with Weimar that folks don‚Äôt consider.  All those special people with vast artwork collections (real art, not Zman‚Äôs ‚Äòpain‚Äô dribbles) got them from people in desperate financial straits.  They bought them for a pittance and then proudly proclaimed their ownership, as though they were the patrons of the great Western artists and musicians forever, not merely taking advantage (as usual) over unfortunate others in need precisely because of machinations by other special people.  Like a snake with its tail in its mouth, it never ends.

        ‚ÄúLike many people I‚Äôm losing my patience for this ridiculous charade. As the evidence stacks up it is clear the lock downs were a terrible idea.‚ÄùThere is plenty of evidence that lock downs are a terrible idea. Copious amounts detailed by real experts in relevant fields and positions. But to me, the Hong Kong Flu of 1968 that I lived through is the real evidence. It was much, much worse than anything else in my lifetime and we did not do anything but keep on running the world as always.Real men ran the world then. I was in high school and we kids did not really know what was going on since at our age we could barely be hurt by the Flu. Moms and Dads worked on to make sure we kids were taken care of.My what a difference 50+ years make.

            I was 14 in 1968 but I have no recollection of any reports of an influenza pandemic. My reccollection of 1968 is that it was dominated by the Vietnam War the DNC convention in Chicago, and the May demonstrations in France.  But you‚Äôre right, real men, even if they were misguided, were in charge back then.

        The Commie Cough reaction is amazing.  A month and a half ago were going into lockdowns to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù so that hospitals weren‚Äôt overwhelmed.  It was never sold as the cure.Now the curve is flattened and there is no chance of the health system being overwhelmed.  But the goalposts are nowhere in sight in Blue states.  Governors are tossing out impossible to meet ‚Äútesting‚Äù standards and other complete nonsense as per-conditions for reopening.  And some people are fine with it while their neighbors are bankrupted over nothing.

                Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, a German physician, maintains that the test is not specific for COVID-19 and picks up other coronaviruses.  He further maintains that, without the test, this pandemic would have passed mostly unnoticed until epidemilogists crunched the numbers in the summer and concluded that 2019-2020 had been a particularly bad, late-breaking flu season.

        The foundations of the entire global order have begun to shake so hard that I sometimes catch myself wondering ‚ÄúIs this is even really happening?‚ÄùWhich is the same thing I wonder when I see that so many who did so much in 2015-16 are, so far, failing so seize the main chance.2020 was always going to be the wrong year to spend infighting, defending Weinstein, denying the Holocaust, attacking groypers, debating immunology, etc.But now we are being given the opportunity to stamp a Nationalist vs Globalist dichotomy on the brains millions of Americans.We blame globalism for everything and get everyone around us to do the same.This is the shot.  There is no other.  Not in 2020.Such a message is not only factually accurate, it is morally justified, politically expedient, and easy to remember.The trauma from this experience is going to last for the rest of our lives. This is why the most important thing is to brand it with a meaning that will last even longer.I do no understand how so many of our guys either cannot or will not see this.

                    Organization is key to any kind of political or martial success but any organization that wants to succeed but be aware that subversion is the law of the land.Also any  group that starts as a tax protest is suspect. The questions of the  day aren‚Äôt taxes but deeper social and cultural issues.Well meaning groups like the Tea Party don‚Äôt get that no tax policy can fix the US, only radical change and a bunch of old farts in tricorne hats aren‚Äôt the guys for the job.And yes I know many Tear Party guys were younger, they just struck me as country clubbers not people out there helping the only people that matter, the working and the middleIf society used tax policy to make sure that there were no rich but there was a working and an upper middle, it would do fine. We can‚Äôt get rid of the poor but we don‚Äôt need the rich eitherOh and I define rich either as say 50x the minimum wage or the way they did (inflation adjusted) in 1952, over two million a year.We can live without people having that much money, well so long as we limit corporate money as speech but that‚Äôs another story.

                        The highest and most destructive tax is not on income or consumption, but on the right of free association. The hidden cost of approximating this right in action are manifold. The insult to injury is that the majority of economic taxes paid are then spent to increase the cost of free association. I don‚Äôt know much about tax law but I do know that its not okay to be white and the cost to ‚Äòhave nice things‚Äô grows faster than inflation by some exponent that would make coronachan blush.

                    Of course it. This was the last time the ‚Äúnation‚Äù felt it was a nation.
Of course it was 90% White   heavily industrial and you know so different than now, it might as well have been Ancient Mesopotamia but the Boomers grew up in a mass of WW2 agitprop and old people aren‚Äôt usually up to shrugging off the conditioning.
That said the youngest Boomers are 56, AARP ready seniors all ans the oldest 74. They don‚Äôt matter nearly as much a fact which no doubt spurs them to fake attempts to increase generational self importance via faux patriotism.

                WWII brings up ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù memories for us.  The last time as a nation we remember being truly united in a cause.  I can understand the number of ref‚Äôs to WWII we are seeing.  However, that was a different world with a different people, most all are dead now and their heirs have sold the birthright they were bequeath for a bowl of porridge‚Äîor in modern parlance‚Äîpornography, abortion, feminism, globalism, and the like.

        The politicization of Covid means you have to buy into all of the associated BS that gets attached to it.If you think Covid is no different than the flu‚Ä¶then some monkey business with the numbers means all the numbers are suspect and even harmless precautions such as masks have to be considered part of the circus act.If you think Covid is much worse than the typical flu‚Ä¶then you have to agree to going into the catacombs for an indefinite period because even though it‚Äôs spread far and wide‚Ä¶this will magically put the genie back into the bottle.Covid has spiked but it‚Äôs also plateaued within 20% of the high end.  Here in the land of the free it‚Äôs holding  at a rough average of 25K/30K new cases per day and 2K deaths per day.  Even if the  numbers are fudged 25% it‚Äôs still pretty significant especially if they keep bouncing around within the same frequency range.  A long slow negative slope may still go on for months.  We‚Äôre going to end up with some very serious numbers.  Even though the population is 2x what it was in 1958/59 the numbers may end up with similar proportions. Flu counts from past years included deaths from the flu for the whole year not simply for a few months. We‚Äôre already at 60K+ since early March. The year still had a long way to go with a death and infection rate that has plateaued well above the median.  Gray areas: if I had cancer and was undergoing Chemo and after a treatment wandered disoriented into traffic and got run down by a bus‚Ä¶did cancer have nothing to do with my death?  Are all the white men OD‚Äôing on prescription drugs only dying of their own hands‚Ä¶ or does the war on white men have something to do with it? In 1958/59 they didn‚Äôt hide form it nor did they pretend it was no big deal.That said the lock down is taking a bad situation and making it worse. The econ stuff has been covered. Putting more and more decision making power in the hands of people who should be swinging from lamp posts is going to carry costs we‚Äôll have to deal with.  ‚ÄúCelebrating fat chicks in scrubs‚Äù does have a certain comedic value to it.  But this is exacerbating a more deep-seated problem: the further pussification of men and women. We have spent to much time and energy during the past two generations trying to wall off nature, both its true gifts and its unforgiving hand. We now need to over-protect all children, all adults and even those who are about to buy-the-farm from nature‚Äôs inevitabilities.  Our unwillingness to live a full life with all its pleasures and risks has been squelched by our timidness. This damages boys more than any other group. Not letting boys engage in stupid boy stuff which often risks life and limb makes them timid boys for their whole lives. (They are for the most part oblivious to the risk while they‚Äôre doing it. Then later its,‚ÄùHoly Shit! that could have ended very badly‚Ä¶‚Äù)Our ancestors always lived with death and the threat of death.  It isn‚Äôt going away. Trying to hide from it is silly. Learning to live with it puts more focus on the spirit of being alive and how you value your time.If men had a more rough and tumble youth they‚Äôd be better men. They would neither pretend Covid was no big deal nor would they hide from it. And they assuredly wouldn‚Äôt put up with shrill martinets setting the rules.  And if a foreign tribe were to show up and demand endless accommodations and an ever increasing hand in decision making‚Ä¶death‚Äôs door would be much wider.

            The 60k death figure is VASTLY inflated.  They‚Äôre already rechecking death records for the past 6 months and relabeling many ofthosedeaths as from covid.  Those numbers will keep climbing until they‚Äôre closer to their vaunted models.  I‚Äôll keep waiting (and hoping) for the piles of bodies.

            Regardless of the exact numbers of deaths‚Äî60k, 80k, or double that on a yearly basis.  We miss the problem when we compare it to the Flu or other large scale disease outbreaks.  We have never had a disease that to my recollection is so focused (mortality-wise) on a certain segment of the population (+65) as this one.  We‚Äôve never had a disease outbreak that I remember that has quarantined the healthy and in essence shut down the economy and beggared the population.My general thinking is that this present, poorly focused, lock down will never be repeated for this disease again (or perhaps any other) as the country could not stand it economically.  COVID-19 will burn its way through the susceptible population and then be treated as a recurring annoyance to be lived with.

        Don‚Äôt get salty. When events start to mess with one‚Äôs head, I‚Äôd recommend reading about Alexander the Great‚Äôs encounter with Dandamis in India. I see the Virus and our Ruling Class as Alexander. We should all be Dandamis.
For levity, the Galaxy Song in Monty Python‚Äôs Meaning of Life is probably the best comedic song ever made. That has gotten me through many a salty period.

        The very fact that we had oodles of young men who wanted and still want the economy to crash and burn, deriding it as ‚Äústonks‚Äù and ‚Äúmuh gdp‚Äù tells you something about the West. It tells us that young men have no stake in the society and while they might not rise up to fight against it, they will not fight for it, nor will they work terribly much to prop it up, if at all. In fact, they‚Äôd rather drain it of all the yangbucks or trumpbucks they can get.I cannot help but support them in their desire to no longer be chumps. Some of the oldsters who still have a stake in society will find it creepy, disgusting or even scary, but to a young man who has no legal way of keeping his dignity, yeah, destroying the economy is not a bad deal at all.

            The ‚Äòwait for a vaccine‚Äô people are moral monsters.  They know it can‚Äôt be done, but calling for forever lockdown makes them feel morally righteous and will then act smug and justified when one person dies of Covid after lockdowns end.  Their only real morality is their dopamine response.

                    Yep. Its like divorce court. They call it ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù with a straight face and then proceed to destroy families in ritual killings on the way to utopia.The eat-pray-love cash and prizes delusion of the oppressed and ‚Äújust not happy‚Äù wife is a well known fantasy ‚Äì even by the yoga and bumble ‚Äústill got it‚Äù cohort.But the hate must be fed, so they will roast their golden goose just to hear it squeal.

                I wish them luck to develop a vaccine. However, my duty as a Pessimist requires me to parrot the plausible line heard elsewhere: the common cold is an example of the family of coronaviruses. They are known to exist in hundreds of varieties and mutate often. It is for those reasons that there has never been a vaccine for the cold.

                    Ben.  Yep, and there probably never will be.  Mutates too fast‚Äîif the number of COVID-19 variants now extent I hear of is true.  One thing about capitalism, if there was a reasonable cure for the common cold, we‚Äôd have had it years ago and the discoverer would be fabulously wealthy.That‚Äôs not to say, there might not be a semi-effective vaccine announced.  There is need for a rationale to get everybody feeling it‚Äôs safe to leave the house after all.  I‚Äôm predicting we‚Äòll get something out there for PR purposes and then learn to live with a partially effective vaccine as we‚Äôve done with the Flu.  If this thing quits at 80k deaths, we‚Äôll learn to live with that.  It‚Äôs primarily old folk and those citizens are at the end of their productive lives anyway. (And I‚Äôm one of those folk, but I‚Äôll take my chances.)

        Ironically, the Karen Phenomenon has only proven what the dissident right has known about the sexes all along: that men prefer to work while women prefer to remain at home and support the household.Look at the different reactions to the lockdown: the Karen reaction that we should stay at home for a few more months, or until we get a vaccine, or maybe even forever is overwhelmingly female. The ‚Äúliberate‚Äù reaction, as seen in Michigan, is overwhelmingly male.The dissident right has understood this split between the sexes all along. The Karen aversion to returning to work reveals that most women have never really been all that happy being thrown into the rat race. The ‚Äúlet‚Äôs all just stay home‚Äù pressure is part of an innately female desire to stay at home looking after the kids, running the household, and using peer/shaming/scolding pressure to maintain social norms. Woman is truly happiest staying at home peering from behind the curtains to make sure the neighbors don‚Äôt step out of line.Men, on the other hand, are not suited to domesticity. The overwhelmingly male pressure to open the country back up reveals that most men need to be out of the house doing something with their hands, even if it is just tapping at a computer. Men are bred (breadwinner) for the rat race, not women.The correct response to the lockdown would be to lift it for men, but leave it permanently in place for most women. Special exceptions would be carved out for nursing, secretarial work, some teaching (the teaching of girls; only men should teach boys), and some other niches, but otherwise women should be encouraged to remain at home to support households, raise kids, and maintain social norms, as all the Karens inadvertently revealed during this lockdown. While the attention of suburban and rural women would naturally refocus on their kids, a special collection service could go around to all the childless urban women, confiscating their cats and redistributing them to children. Childless urban women would then be permitted to leave their apartments only to find mates, but not to return to work. Their Karen energies would therefore be redirected into maintaining households and raising children instead of twitter posting.The post-lockdown unemployment rate would also be greatly alleviated by the removal of Karens from the workforce. Paired with a permanent immigration moratorium and repatriation of all non-legacy Americans to further raise wages ‚Äì as was the case after WWII ‚Äì it just might be possible to squash the second Great Depression.

            That would be nice at work. The number of nice guy beta orbiters constantly smiling at, and talking to and hoping for a fuk from the single women is annoying.
I sound like a grump (maybe they‚Äôre just friendly people) but the same betas don‚Äôt put nearly as much effort in talking to the married women.
Talking to women isn‚Äôt inherently bad but the beta orbiters piss me off.

        The truth is painfull and difficult to accept .But we deserve what we are getting .We lost our civilization at Stalingrad.In history there is sometimes centuries past and nothing of importance or any change is happening.And then one day something comes what will change everything for next 100 or even 200 years.For us in last 150 years that was SECOND WORLD WAR.We think and historians write immense volume of books how our heroic Generals and soldiers won the war against very ,very bad enemy .It‚Äôs  absolute obvious now without any shred of doubt for me personally that we actually lost this war and won only the battles . There is this one time in history when you have to make the right choice to keep your civilization .We made the wrong choice in the only moment when matter for us in last 200 years.Unfortunately, there is no way coming back from this moment of absolute importance now .There is before and after the war. It‚Äôs like before and after Jesus .Or Muhammed.It‚Äôs like mathematics .2+2=4 .It will never amount to 5.The flow can be stopped only if turn the river back.To do that will cost unlimited amounts of energy.This energy can be paid only with huge ammount of blood.I‚Äôm not pessimist.I try only to think realistic.The problem is that every single day past we are loosing another  pint of our blood .So is not yet ,but soon we will not have enough energy left to turn the tide.

        I had a history teacher while I was in high school remark that late in Czarist Russia there were many Agent provocateurs who were more or less, double agents.  Specifically he cited ‚ÄúBloody Sunday‚Äù when a ‚Äòpeaceful mob‚Äô was gunned down while they were protesting near the Czar‚Äôs residence.  Basically the story told to me was that the mob had been infiltrated by state actors who were going to agitate the crowd to try and overthrow the government, but then had the thought ‚Äúyou know while I‚Äôm here, why don‚Äôt I‚Ä¶try to over throw the government!‚ÄùI thought the story was malarky, but when I later fed it to a level headed and knowledgable historian I know he said that it was well within the realm of possibility at that time in Russia, so who knows.

            That is actually the case; the controlled opposition became real for the Tsars.
However; the same thing happened in France with the Jacobins (created by Duc of Orleans) with the Bolsheviks (Ludendorff) with the CPUSA and the ALF-CIO, with the Baathists and Wahabbi in Iraq, HAMAS, PIJ in Israel,  we can go on.   Point being never assume its a fake oppo, and it can quite become real oppo.
I‚Äôm generally not in favor of deceit, certainly not fashioning the instruments of your destruction.
We can actually add Hitler being ‚Äúco-opted‚Äù by the German conservatives he later shot in 1934.

                    The French Revolution is the shedding of societal norms and constraints, so people could freely act out their hard-wired selfishness, cruelty, and barbarism.  The societal constraints and norms are quickly being shredded here and now.  There is no reason to believe that 21st century Americans are fundamentally different than the 18th century French.

                    the smarmy liberal king, the worst of all worlds.the Bourbons were parallels to the neocons, willing to play the game and get canned, as long as they remained in the game getting their cut.i do wish Louis Napoleon and the Kaiser had been friends instead of enemies, they had some things in common. but there were those old Gallorroman-Germanic, Catholic-Protestant rivalries. besides, the Catholic reactionaries knew the dangers of liberal democracy first (their citizens less able to cope with it naturally as well) and thus reacted stronger, perhaps too much; leading the German Empire to simply replicate the liberal industrial powerhouse their Anglo cousins had done and allying with them in squashing both communists on the left of ‚Äúclassical liberals‚Äù and likewise those on the right of the ‚Äúofficial right‚Äù: traditionalist rural and small town forces that later abandoned neocon monarchism and proposed nationalism and fascism. this meant subverting Southern and Mitteleuropean and eventually Eastern European nations. sadly eventually the Kaiser himself would be subverted too. besides, some degree of communism was a tool of them anyway, as it became obvious the masses it harnessed in the name of international brotherhood of man could become a tool. at least the Church would give to Caesar what belonged to him ‚Äì but thus She had to be subverted too.

            There is plenty of rebellion going on here in California however it doesn‚Äôt get reported.The thing people don‚Äôt get about protests is that they mostly don‚Äôt work.The largest protest in human history, a giant millions  of people march against the Gulf War  back in the early part  of this century was ignored.Sometimes  a well organized voting campaign can work  but only sometimes and it must be done by people who understand that most people will say and do anything to get elected and than cheerfully lie and backstab those who put them in. for the establishment.Getting people fanatical enough to follow through and with a support network enough to protect them from the establishment is the key.Don‚Äôt be like the Tea Party , all focused on money and than get your guys bought off.This is what I suggest as the other options are far less pleasant and any sane person would like to put them of if possible.Upside if they do become necessary your organization will serve you well in taking power by any means necessary.

There are rumors that Trump will force everyone to get a poison jab to satisfy Bill Gates and the rest of the poisonous vaccine crowd.
I realize that many even on the right think that vaccines are safe and effective; especially when developed in a hurry ‚Äî but do you agree to MANDATORY jabs even for those of us who can‚Äôt take the immune system destruction of these ‚Äúmagic injections‚Äù.

            I agree that vaccines should (usually) be voluntary. I concede that vaccine ‚Äî like anything ‚Äî can have a downside. But I give the ‚Äúpreponderance of the evidence‚Äù to Jenner (discoverer of smallpox vaccination). Nearly three centuries of science and medicine validate the value of vaccines. Yes you should be free to refuse it. But the government has a similar right to (say) refuse you to enter a foreign country that requires proofs of immunization, or for a child to attend a school. In ‚Äúnormal‚Äù times, the government can and (rarely) does impose what seem Draconian measures to the libertarian. I think there was a case with the SARS virus a few years ago, where a known carrier intended to travel overseas against medical orders. The government used its Public Health Service (?) power to quarantine him, something very rarely done. Call me a big government apologist if you like, but a rational argument can be made to confine (temporarily one hopes) a person who poses a clear and present danger to others, yes even if he‚Äôs committed no crime; in this case that a deadly disease could be spread about. And surely, some types of regulation is required during the present crisis, even if nobody will agree on the specifics. Covid-19 ain‚Äôt Spanish Flu, but it‚Äôs not the common cold either.But yes, I will be highly skeptical of a brand-new vaccine like one for Covid-19, by definition not well-tested. Let the other guys be the guinea pigs. There is an old saying: ‚ÄúThe pioneers get the arrows, the settlers get the land.‚Äù

But besides watching my late father-in-law and his best friend both nearly die in 1976 due to a bad vaccine, I have always known it was a scam since you may not sue the manufacturer or the doctor over any damages. Explain that. I can sue the manufacturer over almost anything ‚Ä¶ except vaccines. Imagine how safe they must be.

        Our Conservative Degenerate cites the 1948 SCOTUS.  This is after 16 years of an extreme progressive stacking the courts.  Before the FDR court started overturning centuries of law, the courts repeatedly held that pornography was not protected speech. FDR appointed EIGHT judges to the SCOTUS!It was the courts, starting with the FDR stacked courts that have pushed all of this buffoonery on us.  There is a damned good reason Congress amended the Constitution to prevent this from happening again.  OF COURSE it was a progressive that did it.Thank God JFK was assassinated!  Who knows what evil he would have done.  He was as popular as FDR and probably could have gotten a lot of evil pushed through if not for the assassination.  Had someone assassinated FDR, we might have avoided the war.  WW2, might have been a fairly minor war without FDR.

As far as the Michigan gun bearers;Best to take things at face value until proven otherwise.  They could be false oppo, but without facts and evidence otherwise the Armed Ham Sandwich is probably just armed Hams (pun intended).   Also cheer up, armed fake oppo and fake oppo in general has a pronounced tendency to become real.See AFL-CIO, HAMAS, for that matter the Bolsheviks.

            My brother is a gun collector/hunter rights type of guy here in Michigan.He recognizes the type and they really are a pain in the ass to the rest of 2A people.
No those morons are real, larping as real rights advocates. Zman is right, all movements need to police their ranks. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they are planted or real. Stop them.

                People with guns don‚Äôt bother me but I guess that makes me an oddball.  Never understood why a country that enshrined the 2nd would be uncomfortable with people actually exercising it.  It‚Äôs not like they were making threats.

                The rest of the 2A people are troubled by armed protestors?
I think perhaps the ‚Äúmorons‚Äù are the real 2A types, and are a pain for the hunter / gun collectors?
The 2A ain‚Äôt real anymore, and none are Americans.  We‚Äôre all re-enactors at this point.  But the 2A has naught to do with hunting or gun collection.

        Tucked in among the voluminous media pseudo-analysis of the Chinese virus is the news that once again, after 48 years, government and private agents are going to send men to the moon. What is the purpose of this effort? Other than victory in an international competition for prestige? Sure, as is always the case, proponents point out that the technology that makes this possible has spill-over effects that enhance our life here on earth. No way these kind of technological advances could occur without a lunar expedition.Private firms, Musk and Bezos creations foremost, are involved in the project but their efforts aren‚Äôt necessarily an exercise in free market capitalism. They want the same subsidies they get for other techie charades. If the battle against pandemics is so critical maybe the space explorers should direct their time and money to solving fogey failure in nursing homes instead of putting landers on the moon.

            If we get to space we can and indeed must to even maintain space achieve escape velocity from the muds.Its not an option.  Escape velocity Off Earth requires escape velocity from specific gravity of muds.So who GAF if Musk and Bezoes and fuck it North Korea get a Subsidy ?Junk bonds just got $1.45 Trillion in direct purchases from the Fed.  And in this context of Casino Socialism comes talk of free markets?The specific gravity of muds being really in effect less it seems the real drag of libertardians.   go pack a bowl and give up politics, economics or reality.A mud we can thump and they‚Äôll stop.Whatever can we do about libertArdians?In a choice between Musk and Rand I pick Musk.Good day.

                I gave you an up vote because while I think your opinion is wrong, so was down voting it.The sooner the West forgets about ‚Äúprogress‚Äù as a goal and starts to want to ‚Äúconserve‚Äù what we have, the better off we will be.The simply matter is a society that can barely keep meat on the table and isn‚Äôt bothering to have families or babies cannot have luxuries like a Space Program.In any case colonizing Mars and the Moon is basically impossible and going to the nearest Class M planet at 1/10 C a speed we cannot reach would take 40 years.And the rest of us are far better off grounding Elon Musk for good than allowing the rich to pull an Elysium so they can escape the consequences of the polices they espouse.Screw space travel.

                    I‚Äôm an avid SF fan and it amuses me when, even in the real world, intelligent people claim that colonizing space is an option. It‚Äôs not very sensible economically. Heinlein‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress‚Äù posits a successful lunar colony that grows and ships needed food back to Earth. Now of course fiction is not meant to be taken seriously and Heinlein has his dry humor. This is where (or popularized) the phrase ‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù And when you find out what the pie in the sky would cost, it makes sense to stay down to earth. A final problem, rarely mentioned by the Utopian dreamers, is this: even if we could ‚Äúescape‚Äù to some other world, why would anyone believe that we would not bring along the same problems that we are trying to escape from? This is the only home we have; hopefully we‚Äôll learn to take better care of it, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

                            You go to the moon because it is cool. Its a good jumping off piont for the solar system.  Our planet is lucky to have a moon.  As far as cost, insignificant.  the time of a few 1000s engineers and a nuclear reactor or two.  Come on guys, I know we are a bunch of cranky racists, but have a little vision.  Whites have north america and australia becuase we are natural explorers.  As soon as they figure out how to rope in a big asteriod made of gold the discussion will be academic anyways. And as far as building an army, to take on the favellas‚Ä¶  We already have that. It answers to the wrong leadership.

Hell we can probably do that with only 1 NASA but 30 of them working in parallel would speed things up enormously.As for the global economic collapse, that wasn‚Äôt caused by the virus but by the panic that spread in a population already terrified of the slightest risk and also an innumerate one that failed even to be risk-averse in a sensible way.  This timid, feminized mentality is THE problem.  It‚Äôs why space exploration languishes, it‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no real progress in medicine, it‚Äôs why our super-army picks ‚ÄúGodzilla vs. Bambi‚Äù fights with shitty ME regimes whose soldiers surrender before a shot is fired instead of defending our actual borders from the immigrant hordes.Finally, let‚Äôs imagine that we get everything we want.  PoC populations stop expanding, subsidies for child rearing start white population expansion again.  The world will still be in need of energy, metals, especially the rare earth elements that the Chinese currently have a corner on.  A robust, expanding white civilization needs space exploration.  The sci-fi writers of the mid 20th century all saw this and were backed up by the scientific establishment as well.  The failure of will and vision came later and is what caused the disastrous turn away from scientific progress and towards wacky social experimentation.

                                Colonizing space is not the same as the existing space program and would cost hundred or thousands  of times more.,It costs vast more to ship food/water/air and other supplies to the moon much less Mars than anyone can afford.Colonies here on Earth had  to be self sufficient and  send back cheap or super useful  resources otherwise they will be abandoned.No asteroid mining isn‚Äôt going to do it and if we went down that route, that isn‚Äôt a colony. It a few robots and a couple of techs making globocorp rich.We also don‚Äôt need these things as the developed world has low fertility and that is almost certainly never going to go up only down except by immigration from less developed nations.Its not the age of overpopulation hysteria far more Children of MenOn top of that mess it was nearly impossible to get women to go to colonies.Louisiana  back when it was French had to clean out its prions and nut houses to get enough women to keep huge number of male citizens from becoming metis or going native.We don‚Äôt have to worry about Martian hybrids , they lay eggs. OK EBR joke there but women are not going to live in super max millions of miles from homes just because people think its coolCould a functional USA or China put a few guys a lunar base? Sure. But that‚Äôs not a colonyCan a functional USA or China  send a few guys to Mars? Sure. But that is not a colony.Nor of the Globohomo Opression Station Elysium a proper colony.Why people want to colonize a planet with essentially no air, soil that is toxic waste (percolates are deadly component of rocket fuel) no usable water and high radiation is beyond me.On top of that it many not be possible to even have children on the Moon or Mars do the low gravity.If the US  becomes functional  and stops turning into Brazil and than somehow becomes 85% White, heavily industrial with a small financial sector  , low low unemployment  a growing population heavily into the right parts of STEM, and the urge to do it we can reignite the space program.Otherwise most stuff going up just spies on people, send com signals and we do a tiny amount of exploration and learning.

                                    Nobody cares if a mining colony, here or in space, is a nice place to raise kids or a nice place to live. In fact, this is something we want the Beckys and Karens to stay home for. The purpose of a mining colony is mining and initially it will be high value minerals and then later people will realize that it makes a lot more sense to build spacecraft and larger structures from resources you harvest in space than bringing them up from earth. No one but the feminized and morally adrift West is standing still on this either. The Chinese certainly arent. Neither are the Russians or even India. The Chinese already have a near monopoly on rare earth elements here on earth. They want to extend that to the whole solar system. Will we let them?

                                        The population of Russia is half that of the US and is less than 1/10 ours.China is a bit better off but they won‚Äôt be after the blowback from the Covid issue.As far as rare earths, we have plenty in the US. We just don‚Äôt want deal with the consequences of mining or hell any heavy industry.So to be clear, this will not change. Our  financier bosses will not permit it and if there was a rebellion, there won‚Äôt be enough left to do anything with.A one half White Leftist financier run USA is not going to space in any serious way.The real solution is one i know no one wants a to hear. Find a way to eliminate demand for exotic materials. Use less, want less, make less and just live instead of worshiping at the alter of progress and more stuff.In the short term, sure we will need to protect ourselves with high tech tools but industrial society does  not have a future  long term.No sense prolonging the agony, dial it down slowly and naturally and as the collapse unfurls, we‚Äôll be far better off since we‚Äôll have made the needed changes.

                        orbital space stations are not easy to live on. look up all the diseases astronauts suffer.if the will to flee is so bad (typical north sea/prot), just build islands on the sea and get over it. recover those seafaring roots while at it.or just force the meat on the table. no need to guillotine the rich‚Ä¶ at least not all of them. simply make the masses‚Äô presence felt. you may laugh at the inferior browns and their thuggishness, but they do keep you out of their hoods don‚Äôt they? meanwhile whites have to be proper, because‚Ä¶ the (((college professors))) said so? heck, even Catholics up until the 60s knew to tolerate but not approve intermarriage, ask Italians and their contentious relations with blacks in the hood‚Ä¶

                    To abprosper.We have to think that having  another branch of humanity  in another planet is an insurance if this planet and life on it is destroyed.  With technology advancing the way it does that could happen.  In 1986 some officer in Soviet Union saw ,by mistake our rockets coming. it was his job to push the button . He assumed that maybe it was a mistake and didn‚Äôt do it. Basically he screwed up because he was human. Next time a machine will not screw up. Also when men walked on the moon it was a high  point Of humanity. We either move forward or we move backward. China started exploration when its technology was equal to the west but stopped it and stood still for 500 years. Europeans got moving and that caused enormous progress in everything from math to medicine not to mention technology. Now China is moving and we are standing still. At least Trump told NASA to go to mars.

                    Assuming that costs would be reasonable which is questionable,There is going to be less and less demand as we continue to reverse  industrializeAnd yes we are already doing this. Its a demand side problem and before we even consider space we have to reform the family structure and push fertility up.1.6 or lower everywhere is not going to cut it as the global population of  developed nations has had low fertility-for nearly half a century and its not going to stop.So you understand the issue ,while you can‚Äôt project population projections forward, within a couple of centuries it won‚Äôt be Star Trek but the majority US population will be Amish

        Re: ‚ÄúLike many people I‚Äôm losing my patience for this ridiculous charade. As the evidence stacks up it is clear the lock downs were a terrible idea. It is time to go back to our normal routines, but the people in charge have the whiff of authoritarianism in their nostrils and like a rutting beast they can think of nothing else. They are now busy dreaming up more insane restrictions just to humiliate people. It is increasingly difficult to remain a reasonable person. I‚Äôm getting a little salty.‚ÄùZ-man, to use the IT quote, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature‚Ä¶.‚ÄùProof of that particular pudding lies in the various measures at the local, state, regional and national levels clearing the way for the call-up of National Guard troops, possibly their federalization. POTUS has also quietly preauthorized the mobilization of the Marine Corps Reserve. Gee, is it just me or does it almost appear as if TPTB are looking for an excuse to tighten the screws on the American people.

        Anyone know what happened to that guy who used to host Fash the Nation with Jazz Hands?   The guy with the smooth deep voice.  He left the show about 8 months ago.  Dude was cool as hell.  Those two made a great team.   Up there with Pat Summerall and John Madden.  Sick flow between them.  Jazz was the spaz.  Other guy was laid back.  Funny guys.  Just wondering if he‚Äôs doing a podcast on his own now, or if he‚Äôs totally out of the game.   As a mellow dude, I think he was just done with all this noise.

        Boo on you today! Yes, Libertarians are probably closer to today‚Äôs Democrats: legalize pot and open borders. We‚Äôve had the latter de-facto for decades. üôÅ They‚Äôd also favor the internet porn industry. It is (mostly) a victimless crime (if it were a crime.) ‚ÄúYour daughter‚Äù showing off her body for pay? So what? If she is over 18 or 21, she is an adult and her life is her responsibility, not Mommy and Daddy‚Äôs. (Yes, this assumes is not living under your roof.) In my laissez-faire opinion, the government should not be the moral arbiter of people‚Äôs private behavior. Yet once such behavior starts to impact innocent bystanders, yes the government should step in. But this would also entail letting people crash and burn, in the wonderful words of the old testament, ‚ÄúThey have brought it upon themselves.‚Äù But of course, THAT idea is unthinkable to Democrats!

            The idea that you can or should divorce legality from morality is one of the worst errors in lolbertarian thinking.How would re-criminalizing both drugs and porn make America a worse place?Every counter-argument relies on slippery-sloppiness like ‚Äúfirst they came for‚Ä¶‚Äù  Black-letter precedents are pretextual ‚Äì see your ‚Äúliving Constitution.‚Äù  If there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way and just because we outlaw porn doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre going to execute political dissenters.We‚Äôve tried this your way and despite the black-letter clarity of the First Amendment, we have political censorship AND legal porn, as well as state-mandated anti-religiosity ‚Äì the precise opposite of what the Founders intended for each issue.

                It should be made/kept illegal if for only one reason‚Äîlack of responsibility/accountability on the part of the user.  That‚Äôs where Libertarians get it wrong, they assume accountability on the part of the individual where none exists in the welfare state as we know it today.In other words, you can be a no account drug addict and regardless of your irresponsible behavior you will be given free emergency care, allowed to live, shit, and pan handle on the streets, and so forth‚Äîwhile those who work hard for a living foot the bill.  A similar argument can be made wrt our current free for all sexual liberties‚Äîliberties found no where in the Constitution except in the mind of a few pea brains on the Warren Court.

                    Concur. I advocate the type of freedom where a person is free to do as they wish but only until they start making trouble for others. Half of society‚Äôs problems is too much freedom, not enough responsibility. I say, ‚Äúlet people have sex as they wish.‚Äù But there‚Äôs a stick with the carrot. How about this? If a woman gives birth to a child she can‚Äôt provide for, the government should step in and take the child away. What today‚Äôs society forgets is to take follow-up actions to prevent future problems: Permanent sterilzation for the woman. And for the man, if he can be located. Since most of these people are on welfare anyway, a national DNA registry would make it easy to identify who is guilty.  Was statutory rape or some other offense involved? Then DNA would be prima facie evidence. Send the bastard to prison. The means exist, but not the will.

                Read your American history. It wasn‚Äôt that long ago that people were not only harassed, but put into prison, for voicing politically unpopular ideas. Also, there will always be limits to government power, even in a totalitarian dictatorship. If forced to choose between the two, should a person be imprisoned for what some of us call ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù or ‚Äúvictimless‚Äù crimes? Isn‚Äôt the man who sold a bag of pot a bit less of a danger to society than the robber, the rapist, the murderer? And don‚Äôt give me the ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll build more jails‚Äù canard‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt magically wish goods and services into existence any more than the government can üôÇ Like it or not, the man smoking pot and watching porn in the privacy of his own home is rather less a danger to others than the guy who breaks into your house when you‚Äôre gone, robs the local convenience store, or for that matter, fathers a load of bastard children. Shouldn‚Äôt the penalties be different? One thing we HAVE lost since mid-20th century is the ability to keep undesirables out of our community, whether they‚Äôve broken the law or not. I wish I could offer you that: would you accept legal drugs and legal porn for others, if you got the freedom to keep Blacks, or druggies and perverts, out of your town? I sure would!

                Almost anything that gives this state more power at the current time will make things worse and this includes fighting  porn and drugs.Need I remind you that no matter how many people we lock up in jail and we‚Äôve broken the global record drug use doesn‚Äôt go down. Unless you are willing and able to seal the borders and arrest, convict and either jail or execute tens of millions you can do nothing about drugs at all.Oh yeah well you could keep the lockdown up forever and ban all imports I suppose. If you tightly control prescription drugs, maybe this would work.  Its not worth turning the USA into an even more permanent prison for this goal.As for porn, get real.  Don‚Äôt assume your tastes are shared by any significant number of people. Disliking porn makes you the nutter since self reported in 2018, 98% of men and 78% of women use the stuff.This doesn‚Äôt count erotic literature, sexy romance novels either just pictures . Musingly I‚Äôm in the 2% too but I know I‚Äôm an oddity.Banning porn is as ridiculous as banning water. and I‚Äôm not sure you can get anyone to convict on charge or even enforce the laws. Florida tried with 2 Live Crew decades ago and was litterer laughed out of courtLastly, morality.Yes the core of US morality is Christian and in theory we are awash in church going people, this is not a Christian nation  at all. If it were we would not have porn, mass adultery, single moms and easy divorce.This was  imposed on us true  but it it was also what people wanted as they became less faithful. And yes its not good for people but if you try and force them to think your way, you aren‚Äôt different than the Left trying to force us.Frankly and no offense to you but Conservatives even DR ones cannot seem to understand the world we live in. I swear they need a Commissar with a cattle prod so if they discuss any solution that fails to take the real world people and conditions in 2020 into account they get a zap in the nuts.You have lost the war on porn, war on weed in some areas, war on gay for younger people , war on divorce and single mommy hood and if we were smart we‚Äôd end the war on drugs.The only reason we don‚Äôt allow prostitution is all the Karens though we‚Äôve probably lost that too.We can close the border, repatriate some people , loosen guns laws with great effort and control trade but the moral front is toast.Maybe people will have a relfgious revival or out breed the less religious over time or maybe they won‚Äôt. No one knows but policy must deal with real people including the 49 out of 50 people that use porn and the countless who like weed too.
