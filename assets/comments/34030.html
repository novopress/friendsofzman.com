        Yep. Drives me nuts how the “conservatives” embraced Wilsonian progressive  imperialism and sending armies to invade foreign countries in the name of “democracy.”
If you listen to “conservative” talk radio you will year this kind of shit, like the loathsome Sean Hannity blathering on about how bad the Taliban treated “women and gays.” When did it become a “conservative” principle to give a damn about how women and gays are treated in some Third World shithole?
And when did it become a “conservative” principle to care more about the borders of Israel than the borders of the U.S.?

            “Loathsome” is a good start at describing Sean Hannity. Off the top of my head, I’ll add “big mouthed” and “moronic”.

                A lot of talking heads have come and gone from the prime time Fox News lineup,  many have fallen out of favor, only Sean has remained constant for the last 29(!!) years. And it isn’t because he is saying anything novel, insightful, or even intelligent. On the contrary

                    I will say this, he is far less annoying on the radio. I haven’t listened to him since Rush died, but when I did, which was infrequently, I could tolerate him on the radio. I can’t stand him on TV.

                        Huh. I was kind of the opposite. I could kind of tolerate Hannity, but Colmes was insufferable. I figured Colmes was only there to make Hannity look insightful by contrast.
Saw a clip of him the other day. Man, has he aged. Evil does not do good things to one’s appearance.

                            He shows a little more of his human side on the radio. Maybe because he has more time to do it. On TV all he does is neocon talking points while talking over people.

                            Back in the old days when I used to watch Fox, I liked the hannity &amp; colmes schtick – and you’re right, colmes was insufferable and with an extremely punchable libshit mug.  He also had the ability to make hannity look good by comparison, amazingly enough.

            As cringe and retarded as Hannity is, he is infinitely preferable to the likes of Shapiro.  The average age of a Hannity fan is likely well North of 65, Shapiro has a much younger audience and does much more damage.

                    I’ve always said he has a face for radio and a voice for writing.  He is 100% manufactured.  He has no organic audience.
He looks more and more repulsive as he ages.  Incredible.

                I’m not at all conviced that Shapiro has any organic audience whatsoever.  At least Ive never met a fan of his even among the most boomerish and normiest types there are.
I wonder if it was all mysterious government money and his backers back home.  He went from third tier writer on second tiee website Brietbart to sudden head of media empire?  WHILE he did the never trump thing? How?

                    Some Texas billionaire created Shapiro.  I absolutely agree he does not have an organic audience.  But between being a Jewish neocon and being willing to shill anything the neocons or the gay old party wants him to shill, he is in good standing with the blob and has his financial backers.His media empire is entirely false too.  He gets a new personality and all of the sudden they have millions of followers.  Bought and paid for.We know these people spend billions on congress people and the like, why would they not spend billions on public relations?  It’s probably a pretty inexpensive way to get good PR.

        It’s interesting to watch the reaction of normie conservatives when I tell them that I disagree with people like Rufo about DEI at private corporations, that private businesses, like private individuals, should have freedom of association.
If Coca-cola or Intel want to have a workforce that looks like the overall population, fine. But that means that I can have a business that only hires white men or whomever I choose to hire, just as I can choose who to be friends with. Normies brains can’t figure out how to process this logic.

                Sadly, they have. Normies are just so excited to push back against the anti-white propaganda and policies that they’re willing to accept the loss of freedom of association. They’ve finally found a counter to being called a racist. “How can I be racist if I’m against discrimination,” they retort.
They don’t understand that they’ve accepted the Left’s morality.

                    Yes. As I earlier commented, even as late as the Eighties/early Nineties a handful of conservatives would condemn the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but the few who did were suppressed and supplanted by today’s robots. A guy named Paul Weyrich was the last I heard state his opposition on television to the horror of his interviewer Chris Matthews. Barry Goldwater, who was in many ways a bleeding heart racial liberal, made opposition to the CRA a central part of his 1964 campaign. If that were done today the FBI would be ramming down the candidate’s front door at 4 a.m.

                            Goldwater married a woman 32 years younger than he was near the end of his life, and that explains much of it. He always had libertarian impulses and as I commented earlier was something of a racial cuck.

                        Weyrich was a good guy. One of his arguments, made not too long before he died, was that peoply genuinely on the Right should withdraw from the broader cesspit, educate their own children, husband Western civilization, and then, after America’s inevitable collapse, reemerge and rebuild a Western state from the rubble. We were to be akin to Irish monks in the Dark Ages.

                            Odd that millions took his advice about separating yet would denounce Weyrich in a nanosecond if shown some of the things he wrote and spoke. Cognitive dissonance is the default mode of AINO.

Beyond the pale.  Sacrilege against their real religion.
The assumption that Civil Rights is wonderful and that we must liberate and empower yet more ‘minorities’ is accepted and holy writ in the West.
One-third of Donald’s cabinet is female.  Funny old universe, that’s the number of angels that rebelled, too.  Prolly just a coincidence. :O)

He has suffered nothing personally at the hands of the Civil Rights Regime, the upper class largely being exempt.
No harangues of privilege, racism and sexism by fat women-of-color on the jobsite.  No passing-over for jobs or ed slots in favor of the female or the ‘minority’.  No third-class citizenship in the classroom and courtroom.

                                        Yes of course, I know these things too.  But I don’t think that Donald equates the Civil Rights Regime with those events.  He may well believe that only one segment of, for example, intel participated in those events.
P.S. you’re forgetting the lawfare against him.  yr welcome

                        Exactly so. This Metcalf moron, and there are millions like him, would be leading a lynch mob against his son’s killer if the perp had been white. These types are lost and while extreme shame can be weaponized against them in rare cases, they are little more than racial Moonies.

                    Yes, the Rufos and James Lindsays of the world have spread the term “woke Right” to plant Crimethink “you’re a leftist” into the minds of anyone who dares to suggest such a thing. One of the many reasons I have stopped listening to these people altogether. I’m sure Rufo will get the Presidential Medal of Freedom by the end of Trump’s term, and it’ll be onehelluva’ diverse(but conservative diverse! not liberal diverse!) crowd that day in the East Room.

                        There’s an easy line in the sand to determine who is on our side: Are you okay with whites (or the various white tribes) viewing themselves as a people and organizing to protect and preserve that people?
Lindsey and Rufo argue about much, but both would say no to that question. So would Steve Sailer. Of course, these people remain silent about other groups doing just that.

                            I have right-wing gun-nut friends who would cut me off if I asked them that. Reason? Half of ’em would be wearing black athletes’ sportsball jerseys while they stood around their F-150s with Trump signs and American flags. One or two might even take a swing at me.I consider this whole thing lost. Pro (and now college) sports (25-year-old professional Serbians in the NCAA, athletes bouncing from Stanford to UCLA to Illinois each year without attending class once) kills it. The normie mind who worships their local sportsball teams follows the ins and outs of hundreds of athletes, most of whom are black or Latino now. They cannot commit Crimethink because of this cognitive barrier.

                                There is no doubt in my mind that sports, and the integration thereof, was one of the prime salients of our current Negromania. White male sportsball fans came to worship the likes of Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays and Jim Brown, white women, observing their men’s adulation of the Hutus, somewhat followed suit, and here we are in the African States of America.

                                    If you took a peak at ESPN over the weekend, the NFL draft was held in Green Bay, WI.  Overzealous, overwhelmingly White fans dressed up in their team’s costumes, cheering wildly for the overwhelmingly black players picked by their favorite team.
The black players were dressed in those pimp-like suits and thick, gold chains, strutting on the stage, while the White fans were essentially screaming about how much they loved them.  A pathetic follow up to Jeff Metcalf’s actions.

                                Bravo, Mr. Metcalf. (sorry, Mr Thoreau). The last round of “college” “basketball” with mercenary teams 1 through 4, decked out on TV with the usual panoply of cheerleaders, student sections, banners, and the rest of the dessicated symbols of “school spirit” was an insult to any traditional enjoyer of the the sport. A bunch of black dudes who could hardly tell you what college they were “attending” running around, dreadlocks and suchlike flapping around, taking 3-4 steps to the basket, palming. flopping… I mean, damn…My entire life of following the sport I have loathed Duke, yet I found myself kind of rooting for them because they were kinda sorta an actual “college” basketball team of kinda sorta Duke “students.”

Jehovah!”in front of people who just want an excuse to stone someone to death. An adaptation covering our time would have the old man crying“It’s ok to be white!”,with the same result, and the high priest – or whatever John Cleese represented in that scene – shouting, “blasphemer! You said it again!it’s ok to be white!”And he gets stoned as well… becausehe said that which cannot be said.

                    Well, I did pal around with Methusy and I don’t recall that either. It used to be businesses under 35 employees(?) were exempt but it used to be only millionaires (billionaires in today’s terms) paid an income tax, so prog mission-creep never sleeps, like kudzu.

                    They started saying it when they realized that private businesses no longer exist—private corporations, more specifically. “Tech,” for example, simplyisintelligence and law enforcement. So it can do whatever it wants to you.You’re a libertarian, right?They’re only against business that’s not of use to the project, small enough to evade diversity, etc. “Guy with a dealership” is still the stereotype enemy.Remember, when Elon laid out his vision for Tesla—when he was still Soy Tony Stark (officially)—it wasn’t to make and sell cars but to use “green” subsidies to wipe out Dealership Guy, the middle-class middleman who can afford a little boat.(And gas stations. They had to go, too, to be replaced by uniform corporate fueling stops, strategically placed to limit personal travel. But that wasn’t happening fast enough, so they just gave the gas stations to Indians. Plan B.)Dystopic convergence. Nothing but “socialized losses” megacorps and infinitely surveilled pod renters. Everyone but us wants it, for their own (they think) reasons.

                    They used to just talk behind your back. So long as you were not set up in the blue hives, , and kept a low profile, you could count on a judge tossing any action they brought for lack of standing. The nationalization of these actions, largely Clinton, Chimp and Obango, yanking it out of local jurisdictions to enforce, is what empowered these harpies.

            At this point having officially-sanctionedracial discrimination (which we do have) would be fine with me – IF it went both ways.  I would not care about blacks having their own prom or graduation ceremony, as long as Whites could also have their own.  But blacks – just like Jews – demand to be treated as both ‘equal’ and ‘special’ simultaneously.  Totally aside from the fact that equality does not exist in nature, they demand and get to have it both ways.  I would certainly patronize any establishment that said it was for Whites only.  Sure, the cuckservatards would screech – but all Whites would then enjoy better and safer lives.

                    It’s all of a piece – anti-White, anti-male animus.  Fueled by envy and hatred.  Plus the cognitive dissonance of accepting that ‘equality’ and ‘special’ or ‘different’ can coexist.  All propagated by non-White non-Christians so that they wouldn’t so obviously stand out as alien in White nations.  Soon there will be no more White nations.  Over 50% of children in the US are non-White; over 40% in the UK.  People are stuck on the number and proportion of adults, but what matters for the future is children.  The White child is becoming an endangered species.

                        Yep.  They gave themselves the envy and hatred, and the devil gave them the perfect system in which to operate it: secular liberalism, or Progressiveness, where resentment at their manifest inferiority is ratcheted up a blazillion by the lie of equality.Coincidentally, Barry the Lightbringer pitched equality or equity at almost every speech.Seeing themselves always unable to measure up, equality gives them the excuse to bring their betters down, calling it justice and progress.Speaking of bringing betters down, the report from the copter-plane collision is in.The hard-charging female copter pilot — one Captain Rebecca *smirk* — failed to obey the avoidance order of the male flight instructor 15 seconds before the collision.After all, what could some mansplaining twit have to say that matters?  She’s hot and awesome, she’s empowered, and girl she HAS GOT THIS!Or mebbe she just panicked and froze. You hear that sound, Ms. Amerika, that metal-on-metal crunch?  That is your doom calling ahead.

                        Your numbers for the UK are wrong. 65% of children born in the UK in 2023 were white. Roughly speaking  68% of children in the UK are white. Not all white people in the UK are British and many, including me, refuse to call ourselves “British White”, rather tick the box for other and write out “English”.

                This is all true. Gov’ts at most levels are committed to your destruction. And most here are convinced it cannot be reformed.
The part of the DR I cannot grasp is that if I had a piece of machinery that was supposed to make widgets, and instead it produced scrap, and I knew it could not be repaired, I’d get rid of the thing. Not the 95% I mentioned earlier, the whole kit ‘n’ kaboodle. Why does DR have a nostalgia for the silly thing? Especially when many point out it was flawed right from the start?

                    People fear the unknown, and most are highly resistant to change, especially as they age.  The left pushes unceasing change, turmoil, and destruction and calls it progress.  The right makes it palatable by slowing it a bit, rationalizing it, and relabeling it.  I’m an unapologetic accelerationalist.  I would far rather see cataclysmic destruction of klownworld – even with all the death that would entail – than live to see AINO continue to slide into Brazil.

Sure, most governments have been bad but what if the rulers didn’t hate you?

                But blacks – just like Jews – demand to be treated as both ‘equal’ and ‘special’ simultaneously.Additionally and relatedly, they demand whites be treated as both worse and unworthy. At some point blacks and Jews will be officially at odds–it is almost there now–and white cuckservatards will be hardest hit. Case in point: Jewish hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was totally fine with anti-white discrimination at Harvard and lavishly funded it…then October 7 happened and the Magical Negress no longer could be the university president.Whites never will be officially allowed to discriminate under the present system, which when all is said and done is what will destroy it/has destroyed it.

            That’s too clever by half for a normie. He knows something is happening, but he don’t know what it is…At the most basic, personal level, imagine the conundrum for a guy like Hannity. He can easily chew up an hour of broadcast time lecturing the choir on the sanctity of individual freedom of choice. But woe to the caller to his radio show who “agrees and amplifies.”“Hey Sean, this is Clem from Florida. Totally agree with you! I own a business and I don’t hire blacks, or Jews, or homos. In fact I don’t like hiring women or folks who don’t go to Church. You’re speaking my language buddy!”Hannity’s next broadcast hour would be a jeremiad against terrible people like Clem.

        The key is to take the poison out of the word “discrimination.” There was a time where it was a compliment to call somebody “a man of discriminating tastes.” Ironically, the people most likely to have this moniker applied to them were people who would recoil at the idea of racial discrimination.The fact of the matter is that people discriminate all the time. Humans are designed for that. If people didn’t discriminate, everything would be a new phenomenon that had to be evaluated on its own basis devoid of any context. Every decision you made from whether you wanted coffee or not, whether you wanted sugar and cream in it or not, whether you wanted it in a mug or a thermos, etc. You have preferences and patterns that are already established.Races aren’t some special category of preference or pattern that is magically exempt from this. Who says? “Jesus,” say the religious. I’m not aware of any Christians prior to the 1960s who had a problem with racial discrimination. “It’s just evil” say the irreligious. Those fall into 2 categories: white irreligious leftists who have no basis for a belief in good and evil outside of personal preferences and minorities who have extreme racial preferences which happen to be self-preferences.Another key factor was that the Civil Rights act was sold to whites on 2 bases: 1. Look at those poor blacks. Don’t you feel sorry for them? 2. How would YOU feel if you’re being discriminated against? Both these points are utterly without merit after almost 50 years of Civil Rights. Nobody can or should feel sorry for blacks as their problems are all products of self-making and they seem intent on generating problems for everybody else. As for how we’d feel if we were being discriminated against? We ARE being actively discriminated against in almost every capacity.

            Great post. Civil rights have been an absolute disaster, but whatever it gives the women the good feels so totally worth our cultural destruction.Was at youth baseball tournaments this weekend and the amount of suburban white women toting around mixed kids was atrocious. They simply should not be given autonomy, they are incapable of making good decisions for their people. Thousands of years of genetics being handed down to you, and you’ve decided you’d do away with your blond hair and blue eyes and mix it up with some color. It used to be the trashy white women you’d see out with color, now it’s everywhere in suburbia. Society destroying stuff.The religious are never able to find any scriptural guide to their anti-discrimination views. If there is any, it is the exact opposite. These people are ignorant of history and their own religion’s history while they swaddle themselves with piety. The concept of racism didn’t even exist until recent history, The Tribe wasn’t best friends with Christianity, etc. but why attempt to understand that when all the history you need comes via my social media and TV? And by having these views I am really really virtuous?

Yeah, miscegenation and/or mixed-race adoptions have become another “conservative value” (cf. French, David and Barret, Amy Coney)

            The fact of the matter is that people discriminate all the time.I laugh at line“The White House needs to persuade Congress to clarify that civil rights mean freedom from discrimination.” Anyone who has bought anything on a loan (vehicle, house, furniture, etc.) KNOWS the banks and financing firms “discriminate”. They look VERY closely at your ability to pay back. And sometimes, boo-hoo, they don’t lend the money. As we’ve seen with the 2007-08 housing meltdown, or the sad case of Mitsubishi USA, handing money or goods to people who can’t (or won’t) pay it off ends up horribly for lender and debtor. Of course, Big Daddy Guv’ment demanded banks allow people to buy houses with no money or a hope in Hell of paying it off to avoid “Discrimination”. 🙄

                    I was poking around X and some shitlib said “I am tired of &lt;insert cultural war issue here&gt;, right wingers are being too mean, can’t we just be excellent to each other.” Obviously, nobody has ever told a shitlib that they neeed to be nice or “excellent” to someone who opposes any of their policies, no matter what they are. I mean, they were knives out when people opposed their gas stove ban. The “don’t be judgemental” stuff is just a very good tool that liberals use to hammer their opponents. The fact that right-wingers tend to be more Christian and many Christians have adopted the Liberal Hippie Jesus frame works to their advantage.

                            Agreed. I remember some coworkers sitting behind me in the cafeteria around May of ‘93 and they were discussing politics over lunch. One female took issue over the fact that one of the guys correctly pointed out how Clinton was never going to give the middle class a tax cut and that his nominees “nanny” problems were a glaring example of the lefts hypocrisy.She couldn’t counter anything he said with facts of her own and she finally said, “Why can’t you just let him be president?” and that comment drew objections from the others seated at the table.the woman I was sitting with said, “That is how you know a woman has lost an argument, with the utterance of that one line “Why can’t you just?”. They’ll do it every time.” .Being in my early twenties and the fact that she was several years older than me, that was a tidbit I never forgot.

                                OK, but I do not believe it is cowardice. I think it’s projection. He can never imagine a set of circumstances where he would react as the left does, so believes it to be just a few bad apples.
And when everybody in his own circle confirms his thoughts, as does whichever flavor of MSM he favors, and damn ’em, his own clergy prattle on about WWJD, he truly believes he’s the moral one.

                Well, that’s most under 30 now, so strap in. They’ll be dominating politics within a decade.I tell my friends in blue states with successful small businesses to get out now, while they still have the opportunity. A few more state elections and the legislatures of those states will begin making lists of property held and bank balances, and go from there with the “laws.” The people who scream and yell when pulled over by a cop for speeding will literally hold the power to take everything from you. But they refuse to concede. They believe they are more powerful, and besides, who’d want to destroy businesses? Don’t blacks read Rothbard? There won’t be any money left afterward! No one’sthatstupid! Then their benefits will run out!

                    No one believes anything will ever happen to them . . . until it does.  Same reason people complain about public schools and local officials, but ‘their’ schools/officials are fine.  ‘Their’ neighborhoods are safe.  ‘Their’ Chinese and Indian neighbors are all-American.  Normalcy bias is incredibly persistent.  Many of those who left blue states during the plandemic are now trickling back; others are busily remaking their new states’ politics.  We have never regretted selling it all and moving to the middle of the woods, but most can’t handle that kind of change.

                        Normalcy bias is the hack that has been used on five generations of Americans. It’s incredibly effective.
I’ve never met anyone who has it, by the way. Even when I describe it. “Oh no, I’m not that way, I just look at the data and reality.” Unreachable. Utterly unreachable.
I wish I had known about it when I was making major career decisions and family decisions in my 20s.

That in part is because locals are less reticent than they were in the past. A few years back a popular bumpersticker was I DON’T CARE HOW YOU DID IT UP NORTH. People say those things outloud increasingly, not enough, mind you, but far more than in the past.

            The other thing about “discrimination” is that too many Christians ignore that God created nations.The words natal, nativity and nation, among others, derive from the Latin word nasci, which means to be born.”The story of the Tower of Babel is a great one for this age because God, by scattering the peoples and giving them different languages, showed how he wants people to live.He definitely doesn’t us jammed together into one country, having to be “tolerant” of strangers and their cultural mores that might be offensive.As for freedom of association, the civil rights movement has created a way for government busybodies to constantly interfere in the lives and businesses of millions. The compliance costs alone, not to mention the awfulness of having to live around strangers, are staggering.In the South, blacks and whites get along for the most part, but they prefer their separate spaces such as churches. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Why forcing differing nations of people to have to be in close proximity is a moral imperative is beyond me.There is no God-given right to access Western, white civilization and the opportunities it affords.

            I went through this argument with my dearest friend, a devout Christian.  “Jesus wouldn’t approve of slavery,” she asserted, even though nowhere in the Bible did he condemn it or call for slaves to uprise or be given their freedom.  Instead, Jesus pointed out thereciprocal oblivations of slave/servant and master.  My friend is not a stupid woman, and I know I planted some seeds.  It’s abominably difficult for most people to question what they’ve been told is moral and accept that it’s all lies.

            Grant:“Nobody can or should feel sorry for blacks as their problems are all products of self-making and they seem intent on generating problems for everybody else.”From the Darwinian point of view, we are all the products of our ancestors’ making of us.The kneegr0w’s problem is that it lacks several hundred thousand years of evolution which the ancestors of the White race had to struggle through.I would also add that the natural mating pattern of most all White Europeans was monogamous 1-Man:1-Woman pairings, with possibly a brief exception in greater Scandinavia, circa maybe the 8th Century to the 12th Century, when polygamy might have reigned supreme amongst the Norse.I don’t know how we could possibly ethically re-jigger [no pun intended] the DNA of the kneegr0w race into abandoning polygamy and adopting monogamy as its primary mating structure.This goes for the j00z as well; the j00z are a naturally polygamous race, and consistently support government policies which destroy fambly formation and encourage effective polygamy [via serial divorce and remarriage].1-Man:1-Woman monogamous sexual relationships are the biological foundation of the White Race.If we Whites cease to aspire to the ideal of monogamy, then we Whites will effectively cease to exist.Which, by the way, is largely the purpose of every single new psy-op which the Council of the Sanhedrin approves to be thrown at us: The biological destruction of the White race.

                Why monogamous, when most other peoples were not?  As a genetic strategy to preserve our breeding core.  We of the 124 alleles for hair and eye color have a plentitude of diversity,as long as we keep it amongst our own.In this way, we preserve and reinforce our unique traits.Abraham had concubines, as do Amerindians; heck, Abe got hisself a whole cousin race out of it, the brood by his darkie concubines, the Ishmaelite Arabs.The Semitic genetic strategy is to harvest desirable traits while boiling off their more assimilable outliers, useful to a parasitic people.  Their cultural practice reinforces their genetics by maintaining a seperate hard breeder core and consanguinity while still blending into majorities with strategic intermarriage.

                The northern European race changed as much for a thousand years beginning with the middle-ages as it did in the forty thousand before it. Two massive changes forged that evolution in intelligence and impulse control: feudalism-manoralism, and unprecedented outbreeding caused by mating dictates of the Church to break down tribalism, which was the single great impediment to their power and which brought about unprecedented outbreeding.Europeans are not the alone in that period of forged evolution; it happened in east Asia and perhaps to an unfortunate extent. Regular execution played a large part in both civilizations. In Europe it was not murderers and rapist at the execution fairs for those were dealt with by families, but men, especially young men, who were vexing scofflaws, thieves, and incorrigible petty criminals.Africans, for one example, never endured this process and it shows, neither the thousand years of man-made change or the forty thousand before it forged by natural challenges.

            I agree, but with one proviso–the word that must be detoxified is “racism,” which in the inclusivity-exclusivity dyad, is the primary base of discrimination. I do not wish to be around negroes, I wish to exclude them, because, for many good reasons, I dislike them. And that is racism. This so-called “pathology” is, of course, entirely normal. What is abnormal is race treason, thesine qua nonof the Spiteful Matants, i.e. white Leftists.

        I know a lot of the Manhattan Institute types. My regular golf buddy is a member. There are libertarian/open-borders types, some Neocons (Karl Rove apparently spoke there the other night), some paleo-cons and quite a few DR or closet DR types. It’s a pretty intellectually diverse right-wing group. Most support Trump (albeit I don’t know a statistically-relevant sample). Many would accept Zman’s argument herein based on my conversations. Heather MacDonald probably couldn’t speak on 95% of college campuses right now without causing a riot. She is as close to the edge of the “great divide” as any public intellectual can come these days. I’ve heard her speak several times in person and I think also she would understand and appreciate Zman’s argument. My $0.02 fwiw.

            I don’t know but in fairness I’ve never heard MacDonald live in a private setting. I have heard MacDonald on television bleat too much about the poor downtrodden blacks and Jim Crow, yadda, yadda. She may be couching her language/lying but she seems in broadcast interviews to accept the larger point about prohibiting discrimination.

                Exactly. She is permitted to argue that the real harm is done to blacks. What she knows she can never say, is that this is unjust and very harmful to whites. If or until people advocate for what is good for whites and advocate for eradicating what is bad for them, on behalf of whites and whites alone, it will only get worse. AA was wrong. Woke is not being put away. It is still very much on the rampage as Woke is not Woke. It is a system that is anti-White and anti-Western to its core.

        Heather MacDonald has good qualities. However, she benefits from the perverse incentives of the Managerial system. Most of the managing goes away if you remove the rules that make need for the managers. MacDonald is not a conservative. Conservatives, more rightly called traditionalists civilizational guardians if rightly constituted, play a role which is to create the illusion that writing and lecturing will convince the crazies that they are wrong. This time, MacDonald will convince enough people who will then vote the proper way to bring about a restoration.It is really impotence designed to do two things. MacDonald reinforces managerialism. If she lectures and persuades them hard enough they will take up proper management. However, if that happened her role as persuader and lecturer and fact presenter will dry up and blow away. I am sure she is fully convinced that she must not upend the liberal order. After all, a conservative’s job is to preserve. That is exactly what they are doing. However, what they are preserving is the revolution that destroyed the system they want to preserve. They are going through the motions as if the system is still there. However, the revolution marches forward and so in reality, the preserver is really consolidating the new gains of the revolutionary system.Young people aren’t buying it anymore. They realize that Rufo and MacDonald are failures at best and lapdogs of the managers at second best. They realize that whatever they are doesn’t matter because they need to be swept away so that the managers and their benefactors like Singer can be dealt with in an effective manner. This is why Singer and his buddies are accelerating the great replacement. By the time the youth can get MacDonald and Rufo out of the way, they may be too small in number to make a difference.The open society makes every search result a blog by an African. They still have two hands on the throat of Western man. While MacDonald lectures to empty rooms and the already convinced the managers and their benefactors continue to squeeze.

            Singer is what they called a “vulture capitalist.” IOW, a late-stage capitalism strip-miner of the assets of sound companies that actually produced things. Are there any of those bones left to scavenge? So I don’t know what he does today, probably he’s transitioned to full-time “philanthropist.” He’s an early-lifer. Not pro-life, just early-life.

I had college friends who had family that lost good jobs because of that buyout.  I haven’t shopped there or Bass Pro since Elliott Management sank their claws into those businesses.  To pretend that Singer and his tribe’s abhorrence of Cabela’s clientele didn’t factor in to their analysis is naive.

        I’ll never forget National Review’s op-ed “Time for a Compromise on Transgenderism”, written smack-dab in the middle of the first Trump administration. It was, of course, couched in the language of civil rights. I am not surprised we are seeing “The Conservative Case for DEI” smack-dab in the middle of thesecondTrump administration, couched in the language of civil rights. It’s the same script, playing out the same way, because their job is to undermine the Trump administration and try to funnel popular support away from Trump’s policies and towards the postwar consensus.It is positively demonic because the postwar consensus is demonic.

                I didn’t watch Conclave but I saw one clip where Fiennes literally says “diversity is our strength”. Obviously, Hollywood was always a tool used by the people in charge of it to undermine the Catholic faith, because they hate the Catholic faith. So it doesn’t surprise me that this movie came out. As for timing, well, Pope Francis was an old man and had health issues for a while, so I don’t know.

        “The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. Apparently, it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.”-Ted KaczynskiRegardless of his heinous extracurricular activities . . . that man was not without insight. Freedom of association is one such traditional value.I’ll add my own observation: If you embrace the morality of your opposition, you have already lost. Mainstream conservatives tend to do exactly that, as Zman eloquently illustrates. This phenomenon speaks to a glaring lack of self-awareness.

            Except Ted is demonstrably mistaken. It’s logically rigorous — if he were right, there would be none who could have resisted the siren song. Since we wouldn’t be here had we been lulled away from our traditional moorings, he cannot be right, other than at the margin.
All he is saying is weak individuals will not stand firm. Not terribly insightful.

        DEI is a Jewish invention intended to facilitate discrimination against white Christians. Similarly, the perversion of civil rights into anti-white discrimination and the abolition of freedom of association was also the work of Jews.  The whole civil rights “revolution” was in fact a Jewish project using non-white front men to hide the actual movers and shakers. Reversing this situation politically will be close to impossible. The Jewish financial and ideological control of the Democratic Party is manifest and the Republican Party is not far behind.

        When someone named Heather evaluates your society and disburses ‘alternative’ information, you’re dun before begun.Why would Heather MacDonald upset the Civil Rights Regime apple cart? It is what empowers, enriches, and employs her as a minor political celebrity delivering that delicious, umm baby ain’t it delicious, attention. Gold vein for a chickadee.No group has benefitted more from the Civil Rights Regime of the past 60 years than women, especially white women, who always lead the charge towards yet more ‘civil rights’ (homos, illegals, gangsters, transvestites, et al.) and maternal totalitarianism.Hilarious but yes Righty men love to imagine that Heather MacDonald, Megyn Kelly, and Martha MacCallum are on their side. You know, the side of conservatism. :O) Like lambs to slaughter.

        Down near the bottom, she writes, “The White House needs to persuade Congress to clarify that civil rights mean freedom from discrimination.” Most reasonable people would not think much of that line, but it is the most important sentence in the whole piece and the most racial thing you could read anywhere. It is the core claim of the race communists since all of this started almost century ago. It is the upending of the core idea of the liberal society in favor of utopianism.Yes. Repackaging bad products doesn’t mean the product has become any better. Ms. MacDonald in fairness probably doesn’t think this is repackaging at all but a return to thestatus quo antewhereby the current blatantly discriminatory regime of DEI is supplanted by fairness for all, which as you point out is nothing of the sort. There was a time when actual conservatives opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because they saw the evil inherent within it. Barry Goldwater was an example of this breed. I don’t recall precisely when the last of those types publicly voiced their opposition but it doesn’t seem to have been any later than the early Nineties. The social pressure shut them up, and Paul Singer types financed the silencing.The only political commentary at this point that can make me actually angry comes from today’s conservatives. It is more their idiocy and unconscious acceptance of evil that upsets me than any outright lying. They differ very little from the True Believer apparatchik found in North Korea.Good essay.

        Paul Singer…Damn man I was following along like uh, Heather MacDonald well that doesnt sound like on of them… maybe I really am becoming unreasonable and it’s not pattern recognition but just bigotry and, and, and… wait Manhattan Institute? and… then who is behind that already suggestively named institution?  Yep.  Literally the same people as always.I feel like the only way to not be an antisemite in 2025 is to either not know their last names, never follow any political discussion, OR just be someone who actively loves evil and so knows exactly what they get up to and approves it.They just make it impossible not to be.  The Every Single Time thing is not a meme so much as a theorem at this point.  Sometimes I subconsciously realize the immense social cost of feeling this way and try to back down to normie opinion but you just CANNOT unsee it.

        I have struggled with how to describe our enemies, communist just doesnt seem to fully fit, i have heard fascist used but while there are elements of fascism that does not fit either. Totalitarian fits but is not specific enough.Describing them as leftists leaves out a few sane leftists left among us and some of my views might be described as leftist,” race communist” however is a decent description of our enemies, as best that i have heard so far.

            Many of them would call themselves secular humanists and that’s a pretty comprehensive fit. Nihilist, reductionist, materialist and transhumanist also apply. Leftist indeed doesn’t quite cover it, though not so much for the sake of outliers but because the coalition is much broader than that. I also suspect the ‘leftist’ views you hold are only considered such in the current paradigm which has given them things that don’t belong to them and the modern excuse for the ‘right’ has jettisoned.

        “Conservatives eventually came to defend and promote the cause on the grounds that it was always a conservative value, as equality before the law is a first principle of conservatism.”Laws are a codified extension of ethnocentric mores (root cultural [behavioral] values that are downstream of genome). Making sure that the law applies equally to everyone (rule of law) is all fine and good. Where the conservatives went wrong was not ensuring the laws that govern us all remained an extension of OUR Northwestern European ethnocentric mores. We now have neither laws that are ours, nor equal and fair application of them. When the laws by which one is governed are an extension of foreign mores, then one has been conquered by said foreigners.Federalism is the notion that different ethnic groups that are similar enough can share a central government as long as government functions (legal governance) that are sources of disagreement are relegated to geographically separate subpolities (ex: American states). This is necessary because different peoples, even similar ones, still have differences in preference for how to organize themselves socially, politically, and economically.Federalism in the Former United States of America (FUSA) began to be undermined almost immediately because the WASP merchant ruling class opened immigration (got to have that cheap labor!) to European peoples that were not part of the original ethnic composition of the country, and thus they did not assimilate easily into the pre-existing subpolities(states), nor were they explicitly allocated new states during the westward expansion. Irish and Italians should have been allocated new states of their own, in a Swiss-style pattern, but of course doing so would have negated the cheap labor motivation.WASP merchants set the precedent and when they were conquered by Jews and displaced as the lead element of the ruling class by the close of the 1960’s, an eventuality that the great American industrialist Henry Ford warned about in his monumental and brilliant 4-volume “The International Jew” published 1919-1921, the conquering IJ’s extended this stability-subverting pattern to non-European ethnics who were not even suitable for stable governance even within healthy functioning federated structures (healthy=adequate distribution into geographically separate sub-polities sharing a central government). Jews, Muslims, Africans, and many of the Asian peoples can NEVER be peacefully coexisted with by Europeans even with full federation, not necessarily because any given group is ‘bad’ or ‘good’ but because we are simply too different in our ethnocentric mores that federalism cannot bridge the gap.So we have two governance problems. First, we don’t have ‘rule of law’ (fair application of and adherence to extant laws) due to the corruption that is the inevitable consequence of demographic diversification. Second, the laws that we have do have on the books that are not being applied fairly, are no longer an extension of the ethnocentric mores of Heritage America.Pres. Trump’s merchant-driven restoration project is attempting to address the first while essentially doing nothing about the second. Resolution of both shortcomings would be necessary for a return to political stability. Merchants will never touch the second problem, because it resolution will by necessity cut into maximized corporate profits. While the merchant reformers attempt to equally apply alien law to us all, the eternal enemy continues to undermine the social and economic fabric of European America. When transnational criminals like Soros who has been funding human trafficking are not arrested, then it is hard to believe that those who currently rule even have the first clue.

        NR, Buckley’s old magazine, recently used its issue celebrating his 100th birthday to condemn him for opposing Brown, desegregation and voting rights until the mid-1960s. It wasn’t enough for them he sold out at a critical time, during LBJ’s “civil rights” purges. They dug up his past offenses against the Party Line, which might have stemmed from his partly Southern heritage. After he flipped, he became the top purger for conservatism, as Z has written about in a couple of places, leaving the movement as sterile as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1980. Here’s the online version:https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/02/what-buckley-got-wrong-and-right-about-civil-rights/

            John O’Sullivan once noted that any institution not explicitly rightwing will become leftwing over time. But, as the case of NR has shown, even being explicitly rightwing is not enough. For there to be any hope of any rightwing institution holding the line, there must be a rightwing charter in place that is based upon a clear, rigorous and rigid definition of Rightism, and absolute ideological purity of all members must be maintined through discrimination and occasional expulsion. What’s more, there must be the willpower to do what is necessary permanently.

            That’s rich but quite on brand. In addition to being realistic about race, Buckley was a typical Catholic rightist of his era and had big problems with Israel and Jewish influence. I have absolutely no doubt he attacked Buchanan and wrote IN SEARCH OF ANTISEMITISM to project his past onto someone’s present and divert attention there; someone had to finance his clown show. So it makes perfect sense NR would now offer up Buckley as a human sacrifice. When Z writes “never trust a conservative,” believe him.

        Saw an image on npr the other day of some middle/older privileged white women protesting… something.
One had a sign which read “Say ‘no’ to transgender discrimination.” Transgender is not a word but anyway I take this to mean; “Say the word ‘no’ to discerning the difference of people who are not acknowledging differences who want to be different.” Do I have that right?

        Conservative Inc. may be the same old, same old, but Power does not care what they babble. The true believers and the grifters, like old Mitch and Nancy, believers and grifters both, will believe and grift until their last breath. But other power centers have other issues, and frankly reject the entire framework of Con Inc and Grift Inc.Rumble, Youtube, Odyssee, etc. all have all sorts of people who appeal to … wait for it … men. Motstly and overwhelmingly straight White men. There are all sorts of vids, from Sargon of Akkad to the Lotus Eaters to others who are saying things I would not have imagined even five years ago.This is because for Straight White men, there is no future. No ability to be anything other than Neocon cannon fodder. This is grasped pretty much across the board by most White men. Meanwhile Military Industrial Complex understands that unless it rids the US of most of the illegals, there will be no more MIC grift. All spending wil be welfare spending on illegals and their families. Oligarchs as diverse as Larry Ellison, Patrick Soon-Shiong (medical device heart surgeon billionaire owner of the LA Times), Elon Musk, Bill Ackman, and others know that the Manager Karens are coming for their business, money, and power. All those junior officers in the Pentagon know their retirement plan of managing Raytheon’s latest grift will be nothing in DEIverse America, spending all its money on Kilmar Garcia.Public opinon particularly that of young White men is on the side of the Color Orange. Even young women according to one poll have shifted to 4% net approval of the Color Orange. That’s women total, not just White women. Not that public opinon matters much. The stuff over Kilmar Garcia is aimed at elite legal opinion and the managers, not the public. Against that is the desire of the military and backers, and Oligarchs to not only keep their stuff against managers but get more stuff. Trump’s adventurism in Canada, Greenland, Panama, might well expand to the UK, France, and Germany. There are a lot of military people makgin their careers, and Oligarchs traveling to Mars, off that stuff. None of which will happen with more Kilmar. Or more DEIversity.So there is that: Legal Inc. and Managers vs. Military and Oligarchs.

        Getting stabbed in the back by a conservative is as reliably predictable as gravity, but knowing that is not a solution to anything. And neither is the “lesser of evils” justification for voting R. You still can’t reach around to plug the leak and hence you will bleed out soon enough. The Donkey-Elephant duality is just a distraction to keep you on the couch. There is no intangible solution to this problem. Smarter, not harder.

        that it was always a conservative value, as equality before the law is a first principle of conservatism
I’ll never forget when I got a mass email from my local 2a advocacy group, which was labeled a terroriat group by the fbi at one point. Sounds cool right? No!
the leader was arguing that we had to search our souls about a case somewhere where illegals were trying to buy guns and we need to support that because owning a gun is a universal right!

        “One of the tricks played upon the American people since the middle of the last century has been to take unreasonable ideas and cloak them in reasonableness so that reasonable people will embrace them.”That trick goes all the way back to the beginning of the USA. It was used effectively in the declaration of “Separation”, and there’s been no end to its use ever since. To become a good American has required all along a suspension of reasonableness, connivance at obvious falsehoods, gullibility, and practiced illogical thinking. The moralism of the “civil rights” race war emerged in the poisoned soil prepared by the Founders a quarter of a millenium ago. Of course, John Locke was pushing his ideas nearly 100 years earlier. His blank slate essay, for example, is dated M DC XC.A statist boost was given to the poison of Locke, the Founders, and others during the 1890’s when the Pledge of Allegiance and the Bellamy salute (replaced by statute in Dec 1942) were imposed on kids. So Americans had accumulated about six generations’ of bad tradition before the 1950’s came around. Like the Global Zionist American Empire, the roots of the “civil rights” race war are deep and much older than any living American. Part of the solution is therefore obvious, and everyone who rejects this part is an enemy.

        Establishment conservatives back liberal programs because liberal thinkers control the mass media.
It is not just the news (what Donald Trump calls the “fake news”) that trumpets the straight-up liberal line, it is the entire mammoth entertainment complex, which is just as important. What this does is put constant pressure on the citizenry to think at a certain angle to any problem or situation. Conservatives, imbibing the same mother’s milk of mass media, naturally fall in line with the rest…

            OK, it’s late in the day, I’m tired, and I checked out your blog. So you’re Canadian, and you look like David Gilmour circa the release ofAtom Heart Mother.I find this quote from a recent post:America is a more businesslike, serious place than Canada is. It is more anal, perhaps. In Canada, there is a freer, more fun-loving spirit. Culturally, Americans could stand to learn a thing or two from Canadians’ way of life and being.Yeah, nothing strikes me as more free and fun-loving than Canada. Lots of laughs in Canada under Trudeau or the new guy, a globalist cyborg who ran the Bank of England; lots to learn from a one-party state with its CBC, which is like NPR – if NPR was also CBS, CNN, ABC and NBC.
