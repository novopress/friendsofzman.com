        The media’s moral authority was doomed the minute the internet arrived. As the Derb once said, if there’s any hope, it’s in the comments section. As soon as people could comment on stories, they started pointing factual and logic errors in stories and opinion pieces.
Readers quickly realized how slanted or outright stupid reporters and pundits were. Twitter made it worse as we could see how these people thought and what they said about various topics, showing their bias and vapidity even more. The MSM can never regain their authority. It’s gone forever.

                The removal of the comment section from the dinosaur sites was the tell. “We decide, you agree” always had a limited shelf life.

                    One of the early, kind of “dissident” sites I frequented was Takimag.  When they ditched the comment section, that was it for me – and they had some pretty good writers.

                            I also participated frequently at Taki Mag.
The commenting got too close to the bone and precious princess — Taki’s daughter — shut down the commentariat.
Censored the place rather than bear the turrible turrible truth.  Ain’t that Amerika!
I departed immediately and soon forgot they existed.

                            Yes, the Taki commenters were very good.  They dropped comments many years ago and I stopped reading and now it’s paywalled i believe.  Who wants to pay to read David Cole tell me that Mexicans can be white supremacist.  That was from the Allen,Texas mass shooting in 2023 where he declared that some this full blood Meztizo was a Nazi.  Cole is a full blown fellow white person, controlled opposition clown.

                        Yes. AmGreatness had a comment section. At one point people starting getting chased out for violating rules. Talking explicitly about anti-Whiteism got you in the moderator’s purview. Then if you brought up, why is the ADL training the FBI and for what and violating the rules of power you would get chased out. Shortly after people saw that happening they closed their comment section to un-registered to chase out anonymity.At the time it caused people concern and despair. Clearly AmGreatness was/is there as a neocon gatekeeping operation. Prager could rant and rave on with his very explicit and belligerent ethnic supremacism. But others could not. A few months after the purge happened, 10/7 happened.It isn’t just that people got to see the absurdity of the media and their ideas. The exercise of power to censor showed to breadth to which The Regime’s tentacles spread. It was also over for Con Inc as much as the PinkTrannyFudgePackerRacePatronage team. They were always the same team. That became apparent. Even more than that, it became clear who was able to set the bounds of discussion and thus make very clear who held the power to determine what thoughts and facts were permitted to be spoken.Who would have thought the comment section was so powerful. The old letter to the editor couldn’t find the circular file. Bots stand to change that now, but there is no going back. That is a very good thing.

                    Gannett papers have back door comment sections through Facebook these days. It’s not perfect, but the stories on our local paper are fairly active, comment-wise. People seem to behave better on Facebook as well.

                            The problem I found with Facebook before I left (years ago) was that commentary was overwhelmed by the numbers of comments.  Most comments adding nothing to the discussion except to say “me too” or “I’m here”.  Any posting of interest would, within hours, have 10-15k comments—making it impossible to weed through to find substantive thought and insight.  The reality is that the “common man” really is not that interesting in his thoughts.  With 2B+ users, you get my point.Perhaps it was just me and a misunderstanding of the tools available to weed through the commentary, but I gave up.  Far better to have a select audience of informed folk to entertain oneself.

                                Yep. Facebook also has a goofy way of displaying things. It’s hard to find your bearings. But my point still is that those comment sections may still be out there in some form and when you have stories that generate two or 300 comments, you can still get a sense of things by scrolling through them.

                Comment sections on the MSM sites were always heavily selected/edited.  What you saw was the small percentage deemed “acceptable” commentary.  We still have such today on the Internet.  Example, YouTube.  Other media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, you are familiar with.  I won’t comment on them as I don’t follow them, but are skeptical of their new found openness to commentary against TPTB.

            The “Media” has always been a business, first and foremost. The Internet broke the traditional Media’s business model. From that point, the Media needed a new business model – so it adopted the Infomercial (from Ron Popeil and the Thigh-Master). This worked until the Coof vaxx, as opposed to the benign Thigh-Master, started killing folks. Had it just stuck to Lockheed Martin’s infomercials on killing foreigners, they probably could’ve made it work for another generation.

            If not for the internet, we wouldn’t know who Zman is, along with commenters like Citizen or Jack Dobson, Ostei etc.  My daily stop here has replaced the editorial section in the newspaper. The same newspaper that purged Joe Sobran for wrongthink in the early 00s and demanded uniformity of opinion, which I’m sure they thought at the time was “settled” opinion.

Precisely.  What I am finding is that for folk like Z-man, Substack is making a pretty good stab at being an accessible platform for outreach and commentary.  Saves the work of maintaining one’s own blog.

            Filthie:  Agreed, but surely you know by now there is no true justice here on earth.  What will be sufficient (for me) is when the children of ‘the guilty’ – groomed since birth to have the right opinions, theright credentials, and the right friends – find their career trajectory to have taken a permanent dive.  When all those princesses who got jobs at NGOs and charities in Europe find their ‘careers’ defunded and suddenly realize they were never more than cat ladies playing dress up.  May all the politicians and journalists and ‘thinkers’ find themselves, in the last days, with no progeny.  May their lines END.

                You know as well as I that the biggest punishment for these types is being ignored. They could care less about children and have access to wealth (albeit perhaps not enough to live abroad lavishly without the grift in many/most cases). They cannot endure and will not endure lack of attention. No matter how inconsequential these people may be, and most areutter  irrelevancies, they think their “work” is important and that people hang onto every word they utter. The punishment is coming, and it is something that wouldn’t concern normal people, but it is devastating to them. You can see it happening even now.

                    Jack – Slightly disagree.  Yes, they hate being ignored – and they don’t  value family – but they do value status and influence/power.  DOGE is taking away the power by taking away the money.  But along with the loss of income the managerial class is losing the status that comes with their job titles and connections.  They can brag about princess going to Harvard, but when her job as head of “Enlightened Saviors of the Marginalized” gets exposed and defunded, and she hasn’t yet married well, that’s when it starts to bite.

                        If denial of money and jobs results in loss of status, true, but that also is why they will be ignored, which is ultimately what destroys them (pardon the circularity). Many if not most of these childless, self-important humps are leveraged to the hilt so, yeah, the revenue going away will hit home. Status among these types, as we are painfully aware, rides on job titles that are meaningless outside of their insular circles. They are passive/aggressive herd animals, gravitating toward the young bulls whose job descriptions are word salad but sound Important, and isolating on the margins the barren cows who were at the center when they were Doing Important Things. Delicious. I love it.

                    All true.Off topic but I wonder though… I’ve watched or read of the executions of corrupt leaders in other countries. We’re told that such things are merely political hit jobs where the incumbents eliminate their competitors and that the trials that preceded them are just shows and theatre.What if they’re actually legit? What if shitty grifters, murderers and fraudsters ARE being rightfully eliminated? Our leaders wag their fingers and scold that no one is above the law. It’s supposedly Part Of Who We Are. The narrative starts to crumble.What about the purges? Where hundreds of old order politicos are rounded up, and quietly sent to the work camps or firing squad. I dunno about you, but I was taught to view these doings as immoral, with the incumbents being no better than the old guard. But as we can clearly see…the world would be a LOT better off if certain members of the Blob were dead, or at least behind bars. They are directly responsible for 200K dead Russians, and close to a million Ukes. They did it deliberately and knowingly too – and then call us fascists and lecture us on rights and freedoms as they stomp all over them. Who knows how many they killed with Covid?The question I wonder about is … without punishment there is no deterrent. It is entirely possible that Gavin Newscum might get elected in 2028, overturn everything that’s been done… and it’s back to business as usual for the Blob. If he does that…what’re the chances that he starts using the state to kill his enemies? Hell’s bells…they took a few swipes at Trump during the election run ups already… can we afford to let these people keep breathing?Not advocating or telling anyone what to think… I’m just asking the questions… whadda I know?

                        As an interim measure, a formerly alternative, now mainstream, elite is putting people into place to try to oust these monsters. Of course, the old boss same as the new boss thing is true. I think this new cabal is not necessarily hostile to us, and got scared by the types you described, but who knows? There are some aspects of them that are disturbing–neuralink, and so forth. But what you described is in fact underway sans the violence (so far).

                        I think the same sort of things about the future. What if someone like Newscum gets into power in ’28 and undoes everything Trump is doing? This is why I sort of hope the lefty crazies are right that Trump is putting things in place to insure that MAGA cannot be stopped and becomes a permanent part of the way the government operates. In DOGE, we’ve got our own state-within-a-state that could become a sort of 5th branch of government. Is this “undemocratic”? Sure, but I’m long past caring about the voice of the People. The People are now a degenerate rabble of foreigners, women, fags, and morons. Only some of them deserve a say in how the state is run and MAGA and DOGE may be showing the way back to that.The Russian collusion stuff was fake but perhaps Trump and company are learning something from Putin. Putin, or really Putinism, is now a basic part of the Russian state. One of the elements of that is intolerance for foreign meddling through NGOs and “charities”. The Russians correctly see groups like Pussy Riot as cats-paws for alien ideologies. We can likewise anathematize many of our own NGOs and charities for undermining the nation, supporting mass immigration, and yes, “corrupting the youth”.Perhaps the next task for DOGE or something like it is to look into who is financing the Left in our own country. It wouldn’t surprise me if the money trail leads back to China, Israel, or perhaps even Russia, for instance.

                Take heart! That is exactly what happened right after Vance smacked the Eurocrat crowd. The German got up to the stage and burst into tears, realizing their entire lifestyle is now poof. Everything they ever trained for is kaput. The crowd, in 101% solidarity, first applauded him, hugged the little man-boy, then stood like the clapping seals they are. Then they met in Paris the next day to start their long “resistance” campaign.

            Defenestrated the depraved, he did. There’s a good lesson in that. Would that Trump discover his inner Longshanks. Come to think of it, he’s coming reasonably close to doing just that.

        “The media and the managerial class they represented held the moral high ground and people accepted it. This was the real power of the media. Then they squandered their moral capital on the cultural terror of the last decade.”I think the Managerial Class had the moral high ground because standards of living rose until the GFC of 2008-9. The nonstop incompetence since – stupid wars, mass immigration, government waste, corporate regulatory and legislative capture – has become too great for the public to ignore because living standards are clearly falling.

            The GFC decimated the middle and lower classes and led to mass bailouts for the rich, it was followed by Obamacare that destroyed health insurance for most rank and file employees. Then it was followed by the Great Awokening that turned Whites into the greatest villains of all time that needed to be eradicated, the necessity of open borders (“One Billion Americans”), and “The Future is Queer” degeneracy. When you look at it in this context, it’s no surprise that we voted for a disruptor in 2016, but of course the managerial class doubled down.

                Americans did vote for a disruptor in 2020 and 2024. But in 2016 I don’t think all that many of them did, relatively speaking. That year, Trump just managed to miraculously squeak by one of the worst candidates ever seen (up to that time), not so much because he was a disruptor, but more because she was so awful. Which caused the “deep state” to expose itself, which inspired people to vote for the disruptor. That’s my read on it anyway.

                    Trump (1916) proved that “it could be done”.  He was the equivalent of the “bizarro” politician.  He also proved—through failure—that the system was not to be negotiated with nor changeable through negotiation.  And here we are today, a President with no illusions as to the system and backed by a similar thinking populous.

                    I think that one reason, at least, that Trump won in 2016 was that the world had reached/passed a turning point.That year, we saw Trump in the States, Brexit in Britain, and the French electorate reject *all* political parties in favor of the unknown Macron, who ran as the candidate of an “Association” rather than a political party b/cFrench law makes it *much* easier to do that and b/c the political class had to scramble to find a candidate that the disillusioned, angry electorate were willing to vote for even if–and likely *because*–nobody had ever even heard of him.Now, of course, they have buyer’s remorse.And the other reason Trump won was that Americans were simply nauseated by Hillary for many reasons–all good–but one of the most repellent was her *brazen* sense of entitlement: We were repeatedly told that it was “her turn” as though she had some kind of “right” to be the president.

                I know someone whose insurance premium shot up to over 1000 Dollars a month with a 10 grand deductible.  Paying North of 12 grand a year for insurance you cannot use for most things.  Unless she has a heart attack or something really serious, she might as well not have insurance.

            Depending on where you look, the standard of living started started falling in the 1970s, but accelerated greatly in the 2000s.  If you lived in Pittsburgh or Ohio, it began falling in the 70s.  If you lived in and around Detroit, it started falling in the 80s.Kensington is internet famous for the zombie drug footage, but Kensington was a working class stronghold up until the 70s.  Kensington is loaded with shut down factories. So is Frankford (next to Kensington) and Juniata also next to Kensington.  Philadelphia was a manufacturing hub.  Manufacturing was a key industry in Philadelphia.  We went from 2.5 million residents in the late 50s down to about 1.25 million by the late 80s and still have not recovered.  It’s not like we have the original residents who just didn’t move. Most of the city’s population has been replaced.  I don’t think a single German lives in Germantown.The hollowing out of the US has a decently long history as does the clownworld politics.  None of it started in 2010 or in 2008 with the great recession GFC.

        The media’s handling of Big Balls was comically bad.  They should have just ignored it.  ‘A 16 year old kid did something silly and juvenile’ is not news.  They just made themselves look ridiculous by repeating it over and over (while trying not to laugh) and salting it with a bit of ‘he said something racist too’
It also shows how evil they are.  They didn’t learn their lesson with the smirking teenager Nick Sandman.  They try to ruin the lives of young white guys for coin or political points. They should all be arrested.

            The inexplicable wealth of so many politicians always was low-hanging fruit for people who claimed to be investigative journalists. The avoidance of these juicy apples is all you need to know about “media.”

        This is the whole point of the “Gulf of America” rebrand.
Of course it’s nonsense.  So we’re the Army base change names, Mt. McKinley name switch, and ridiculous statues to criminal drug addicts in public squares.
It’s a power flex. Under Uncle Joe and Barry O we were told “it’s no big deal, what’s your problem?  Are you a bigot?”
Same stuff here.  It’s a marker to see who is on board and who is actually stupid enough to challenge power publicly over trivialities. (Plenty, apparently)
“Point deer, say horse.”
I love it.

            The great political artist of our era is Richard Serra, recently dead master of the misplaced metal slab. He did a couple interesting things, but his position in the regime was Big Man of ugly public sculpture. We’ve all been inconvenienced and annoyed by him.A slightly bent rectangle he spent fifteen seconds sketching isyour lifeturned to waste thrown in your path—and a castle (modern equivalent) for him, and a salary for fifteen people who hate you. It’s afact,the fact of your being ruled, and it looks like it. Primitive as an Aztec altar stone, with rust for blood stains.Generals on horses, nation-symbolizing ladies with one boob out holding up a sword, engraved lists of soldiers, etc., are all that same symbol too, but they include a concession: Youcanbelieve they honor the people and their memories. You canthink of somethingother than brute imposition.Ugly things and insulting names are hubristic tests. Can the leash be that tight? The answer isyes, but. But, yes.“The liberals are right about this one. Denali is a cooler name.”

                The modern, Progress! I’m reminded of that book about the Scots again (made quite an impression!), specifically Scots giving up their identity as Scots to become ‘British’.Self-annihilation to become something else, something new. There’s a flex involved, no doubt, but there’s also the subject’s willingness to be flexed on. Dredges up college memories thinking about it. Also western Buddhism lol.Thought a lot about what started it, have said I think loss of religion is somewhere deep in there. A few theories, maybe the Black Death or something— nothing I’m too confident in.It’s the big question imo. What made Western man want to be something else? Figure that one out, and the problem is solved.

                        That’s definitely the most recent example, but there’s something older, a will to uprootedness, maybe even self-annihilation?
Another pet theory: the Hunnic invasions. The ancient wound, per Quigley? Think I remember William Shirer speculating about Hitler destroying Germany with him, like a Norse god, too.
Idk, the answer is somewhere back there. Just need to read more!

        We are looking them in the eye, yes.This is an actual revolution rather than the intended Thermidorian Reaction. I expected best black employment numbers ever.What is not in question is that what we call the “Left” and their little helpers, “conservatives,” were utter media creations. Without a cordon sanitaire and deceptive packaging, what they are unfiltered is glaring and obvious and ridiculous. As examples of their ludicrous reality, look at the tiny European leaders gathering to discuss put ’em up, put ’em up, Putin, and the Democrats defending massive fraud to help themselves and their intended future voters. It is hard to decide which analogy is best–the Emperor Has No Clothes or Freddie Krueger melting down when he no longer inspires fear and awe, so maybe a combination of the two is in order, a Nightmare on the Naked Emperor’s Street. It will be just as dreary and lame as Wes Craven’s sequels.It is well into the beginning of the end of the post-World War II narrative, and hard to see how any semblance of the old liberal democracy model endures. The attempted totalitarianism was/is an acknowledgement of these developments.Good times. No doubt there will be some horrific rearguard actions, and they might work, but it seems the trajectory is set. What comes next may be terrible, but it is coming.

            “Nightmare on the Naked Emperor’s Street” is an inspired bit of comedy gold in an otherwise serious and insightful post.The old liberal-democracy thing is indeed on its last legs. People have not yet figured it out, but they will sooner or later: One of the many things that democracy brought into the world is *total war* or what was sold as “People’s War,” where entire peoples–entire nations–went to war-to-the-death, with slogans for mass consumption like “Fighting evil” or “defending our way of life” and so on.Gone was the limited warfare of dynastic ambitions for this crown or that territory; replaced by total war–total mobilization of entire populations, including women, and of the totality of a people’s resources–material, physical, and spiritual. Liberal democracy in action.Total war upon civilian populations, sparing nothing and no one. Democratic to the core.What takes the place of liberal-democratic republics is likely to be Caesarism of some kind. I suspect that everybody reading this will live to see it, too. It won’t be long now.

                Total war indeed is a cancer that liberal democracy spread, and it is much like a religious crusade. After all, it is better to be dead than to be an unbeliever. You do not have to go too far back in history to a point where a bloodbath like Shiloh or Somme or Gallipoli or Dresden would have been rightfully derided as evil and appalling. Ghengis Khan may have been a forerunner but he was an outlier. His tactics represent the rule now.What comes next will be as you describe. Economics will determine whether it is Caesarism or warlordism if that is the route things go, which seems probable.

They are like Chicken Little with the “Sky is Falling” cartoon. The Senators meeting with the little green man was telling. President trump and the normal Americans are looking kind of done with project Ukraine and the whole money laundering operation. The Senators seem to believe they can keep the grift going, they are clueless.

        The fact that the standard of living has eroded around the country except for the counties surrounding DC has also not gone unnoticed by many proles. You go around DC and NOVA and it is clean and booming while the rest of the country is falling apart. Then you read stories about how it is impossible to fire a federal worker, none of them show up to the office anymore, and Brandon is hiring tens of thousands of people to make sure you get an audit.The media has tried to run cover for their outer party brethren in the bureaucracy but its not working. It’s a combination of them proudly undermining Trump throughout his first term, their arrogance in believing that they alone are saving the country and they are selfless “civil servants”. This article is a nice rundown:https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/16/federal-workers-trump-musk-firings/78728081007/

            Of course I have empathy for the people who got let go before their probationary period ended, but . . .  when life kicks you in the teeth you have to get up and move on.

                I read an article about one guy who was a park ranger, and it’s funny that CNN chose him of all people to write an article on, considering he’s young, White (they’ve long boasted that the federal and state government was the backbone of the middle class for blacks), he’s a father, he’s not in DC but in like Idaho or Iowa, he seemed to care about his job, so yea this is probably the most sympathetic person you will find, but still it’s like… Our system is totally unsustainable and I don’t see anyone whining about the firings putting up ideas on how the budget can be sustainable. And this person was fired because, quite frankly, he is one of the few people who can be fired without too much of a fuss. I didn’t see any career old bureaucrats volunteering to get the axe so he could stay in.

        I will believe, deep in my gut, that we’ve truly turned a corner when no one speaks or comments (here or elsewhere) using “Hitler” “Gestapo” “Nazi” as terms of comparison for anything (speech, press, education, int’l relations).  Most people today cannot remember what happened 10 years ago.  In 1940 the US was 90% White.  That damned war ended 85 years ago and I am beyond tired of people acting as though it was yesterday, or in any way relevant in 2025.

            There’s a Karl Kraus quote that used to be famous: “Mir fällt zu Hitler nichts ein.” When translators were good writers, it was rendered aphoristically: “When I think of Hitler, nothing comes to mind.”WWII is completely imaginary—toeveryone, from survivor to “survivor” to antifa MAGA-puncher to Churchill admirer to living soldier (who now remembers nothing).Even neonazis don’t know what a nazi salute looks like. There’s film!TikTok fell in part for its refusal tokeep Hitlerby banning translated video of him. (The official duckspeak was “content glorifying Hitler.”) Despite “making a deer out of a horse,” the Chinese don’t get it.What’s not around is impossible to make go away.Fascism is an ever-rising threat to Our Democracybecausenobody remembers what it was.

        I can’t prove it, but I have this notion that Trump was Nixon’s revenge. Remember, Roy Cohn and Roger Stone were also Nixon people and close Trump associates.

        ‘They are now on the same level as the rest of us and we are cheering as the DOGE kids put them against the post’It is a beautiful thing.  I’m particularly fond of the screeching and railing.But this is to rid oneself only of Morgoth’s mouthpieces.  Media is ruled by six corporations.D.C. intel oversees U.S./global media and entertainment.  Both the wood and leaves of holly — Hollywood — are considered magical and are primary occult implements of pronounced antiquity.  James Frazer’s Golden Bough, after all, is an enchanted wand hovering over the bloody rites described in his text.Those corporations and government agencies answer, ultimately, to the central banks and global ruling families.  These folk tend to control private security and armies.DOGE pulls down the pants of the lackeys, the pawns, the media mouthpieces.  But there is bigger game in the jungle.

            This right here.  Excellent take.The need to zoom out like this is very real, critical.  The Globohomo Empire has gone nowhere; it’s not been destroyed in the slightest.  Nobody has “owned the libs,” at least not the ones who really count (actually demonic/psychopathic central bank owning, global ruling families).  While hearing the screeches and seeing the squirm of the most visible and obnoxious of the central bank owners’ lackeys here in AINO is somewhat enjoyable, this ain’t anywhere near over.  I believe it to be a serious mistake to overemphasize the importance of the kabuki, or Greek drama style, theatrics here in AINO.  While this is important, especially for those of us who live here and so are always subjected to it — it is not everything.  There is a bigger picture.The central bank owners may be knocked down, along with their sadistic dreams of their Globohomo Empire controlling every last thought and actions of every last individual flesh and blood human (the minority they don’t genocide, that is) on every last square inch of the planetary surface, as something like a Borg Cube from fiction — is not knocked out.  I deeply hope none of us have any illusions or delusions about this, although I fear some may.I read somewhere they’ve changed the name of their Agenda 2030 to Agenda 2050, quietly and without fanfare of course.  Sure, it is a good thing, a critically great thing, that the Ls they’ve taken the past few years have set them back 20 years.  The bad news is this name change demonstrates that those at the very highest level are aware of this, which implies they will adapt accordingly and get right back to their evil project, which evil is so evil that it is literally beyond adequate articulation in words.

                Agree, the enemies of humanity are evil incarnate. These are the Scriptural (terrestrial) powers, plus the (angelic) principalities.‘For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.’ (Ephesians 6:12)The ‘darkness of this world’ phrase references the Christian belief that the entire world lies under the deceit of malevolent heavenly powers, and that earth-born humans are able to apprehend Reality only ‘dimly’.Agree also that the Left by no means is defeated, nor even wounded grievously.These elements operate in the long run; their trans-generational capacities are a great strategic advantage over humans, who must be trained and taught each new generation.Given this, I would not be surprised if they pushed their Singularity Golden Age back to 2050. Perhaps they received more resistance than expected, feel the tide against, and now understand they cannot meet the 2030 date. Too many potent forces against remain.By 2050 their chief enemies will be dead or raptured, but outta the way, which is what matters. This may be their thinking if they’ve recalibrated the date.Thank you for your encouragement.

        Mel Gibson was iconic in Braveheart, but that was a movie and the action was fiction. Luigi was the real deal. The former was entertainment. The latter was tangibly impactful. We’re not out the woods yet. Yes, Trump is making a big difference; but don’t get cocky, it may not be enough.

        “If not for media pressure, the political class would not have done anything about Nixon. The reason for that is they had no reason to hate Nixon, even if they disagreed with him. It was the media that made Nixon into a villain and then demanded the political class do something.”This is not untrue, but there is much more to the story.  The insiders of the political class were driving the crusade against Nixon.  The Watergate burglars were CIA assets.  Woodward was a former naval intelligence officer who was handed the largest story in US history as a green, cub reporter.  He did not investigate anything, but was actually groomed by “Deepthroat”, who was the Deputy director of the FBI.  The whole charade was a deep state coup, with the Washington Post playing its role as mouthpiece.  The Post did create a lot of pressure on the non-insider political class to go along with impeachment, but they were not driving the coup.

            Right. I have even read that the reason the CIA decided to get rid of Nixon via Watergate was that he had said–in the Oval Office where he tape-recorded everything (except for 18 minutes, of course)–that he knew who had killed JFK, but it was too soon after that assassination to do another one, so they did Watergate and used the press instead.

                Good point.  It will be interesting to see if the FBI’s JFK files reveal anything new.  I find it hard to believe any relevant documents haven’t been shredded by now.  Occam’s Razor would point to the CIA and/or the Mossad.

                Am I the only one here who thinks that Trump being cheated out of victory in 2020 was actually a good thing in retrospect? If he’d won, he would have been a lame duck second-termer and we’d probably be run by Madam President Kamala or some GOPe puke. Those 4 years made him good and angry and gave him a chance to “reculer pour mieux sauter” as we say over here (take a step back so you can jump further. As for Pence/Goldberg and the whole East Coast Rino crowd, they are even more irrelevant than the Wokies.

                    Steve, you are definitely not the only one who realizes now that the stolen 2020 election was a blessing in deep disguise.  The Lord works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform.  As recently as late summer 24 I was confessing Trump wasn’t very good at being president, but he was a thumb in the eye to all the worst people.

                    Another benefit is it showed just how far the left is willing to go. Going banana republic on Trump opened a lot of eyes to the evils of the administrative state. The vast majority of the American people are behind tearing down the administrative state that installed a Zombie and locked everyone up while taking peoples kids for not letting them transition. People did not like riding on the crazy train. The Cabinet alone was an embarrassment. The Deplorables like the idea of common sense in government. Losing in 2020 may be a lucky break for the United States as it may have provided enough motivation to fix what is broken. Time will tell.

        Ben Rhodes famously said that the current generation of journalists literally know nothing and journalist just lapped up whatever they said without thought.
Journalists have always been whores, but once knew how to give the pretense of objectivity and play their role more believably. Now they’re the cheap hookers on the side of the street as opposed to the expensive callgirls you could at least pretend were proper ladies.

        The funny part is most of the media hacks still don’t realize their time is over and the figurative (and hopefully literal) gulag awaits.  That said, there are plenty of jackoffs among the hoi polloi who lap up the “media” slop.  On my way home yesterday, I passed an anti Trump/Musk protest of several hundred, sporting signs like “democracy dies with doge”, “president Musk was not elected” and “fascism has no home here”.  Sigh…

            “president Musk was not elected”Neither was Anthony Fauci“fascism has no home here”You’re right. Go home where you came from.Speaking of fascism (and the legacy media), over the weekend60 Minutesaired a story where they did a ride along with German State Police raiding a home and confiscating a phone and laptop because someone posted a “racist” cartoon. X Link here:https://x.com/60Minutes/status/1891282314899910910Two thoughts:1) 60 Minutes is still around? Who knew?2) German State Police raiding a home because of something they said, posted, or printed? Damn, do you idiots understand OPTICS? Do Gestapo or Stasi mean a damned thing to you? Ah, that was Old History eh?

        The media power you often write about is the power to ignore. This is another media power that Trump is smashing to bits. What is coming out if DOGE, and the hyperventilated defense of it by the media, the bureaucracy, the Democrats, and their lawyers, makes it impossible to ignore.Any one thing Trump has done could be ignored away. But 500 things in just under 4 weeks affecting millions and millions of people? That can’t be ignored by the media. It’s almost daily that 2-3-4 new promises Trump made get kept. The collapse of the Ukraine war produced half a dozen major stories in a few days.And on top of this, what Trump is doing appears to be wildly popular with regular people. The other side is left defending either pointless wars, bureaucratic incompetence, outright fraud, and lazy government employees.The carnival barker took their megaphone away and is blasting out truths at 1,000 dB.Worse yet? Every attempt to stop him currently in the courts or the subject of hasty meetings in the EU is destined to fail.They never had “the moral high ground”.  They simply claimed it, and people went along with it.  What do we have now among most Americans?The rapidly expanding sense that we no longer have to believe the lies.

        The ideological conformity enforced by the prep school to Ivy to MSM pipeline was/is a major weakness of the MSM. Whether that was deliberate or just emergent. Some of both probably. There is no one there who is capable of thinking outside the regime’s ideological frame even if they wanted to, which they almost certainly don’t. Which still wouldn’t have been a major problem if the regime’s primary interests weren’t 180 degrees counter to the largest demographic over which it ruled. That is the crux of the problem. There is only so long that such a regime can maintain legitimacy. We could debate how long that was, depending on when you think their interests began to diverge from ours. They made a good run at replacing us before enough of us got wise to the game, but that timeline didn’t quite work out in their favor. This makes me sound optimistic, but I’m really not. I foresee great schisms.

            Demography is still destiny. Trump may slow the Great Replacement, but he is unlikely to reverse it, almost certainly not in a four year term. That will take decades of persistent, consistent work, and it will be viciously opposed every step of the way, often by those ostensibly on our own side.The real danger is to be deluded into thinking that the Colorblind Meritocracy is viable because of marginal gains among nons in the last election. That had more to do with sex than race, and because TPTB only turned the fraud machine up to 7, rather than 11. (Thanks, Israel!)”Assimilation” only makes things worse. Second and third generation nons are more antagonistic to White society than the first, because they have a greater sense of entitlement, and more social status anxiety (like Vivek). Black attitudes and behaviors have certainly not improved with integration.We don’t yet have the belly for true remigration, or the restoration of free association, but if the nation is to be preserved in anything resembling its founding condition, we will need to develop a stronger stomach.

                It will require going after the businesses that employ illegal aliens and in general making life unsustainable for the illegals. I don’t know if Trump is willing to do this and it will certainly be opposed by the GOP establishment. We will never be able to make much of a dent in the illegal population with immigration raids only.

                Tarl Cabot:Agree.  And regardless of any laws or official enforcement, I think the biggest hurdle will be the average White murkan – who must stop being polite or friendly or in any way accommodating to the aliens.  No, you cannnot play with Vivek.  No, you cannot go to Ming’s house.  No, Mrs. Krishna, I cannot give you a ride.  No, I will not patronize that store/hotel/contract laborer.  No, your maid/nanny/gardener will not be exempt, and I dont’ give a damn if you think they are ‘nice people’ or ‘hard workers.’

            Great schisms indeed.
And will the rebalancing of Western demographics take place in a few years or will it be spread out over several decades? Or will there be bloodshed?

        Steve Sailer and Greg Cochran are very quick to point out mistakes by Trump or Elon. They’re both bent out of shape about the whole DOGE thing. Anytime they can nitpick something they do so. I don’t think those guys were ever on our side.

        “Who says?”
Indeed, the whole leftist argument seems to hinge on “we should do &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; because it’s nice”; to which we ask “Who says it’s nice?  Who is it ‘nice’ to?  Not me.”Formerly they could appeal to authority on this (“The Regime says that it’s nice”) which while somewhat effective, also removed credibility from the Regime Bank each time it was used.  Now they have &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.

        Honestly, I can’t blame the media for removing comment sections.I  used to troll on them myself and I’ll be the first to admit that some of the comments many of us made were over the top. (Especially when it involved black crime or some Darwin Award contestant who died in some tragic death.) We were pretty bad but it was a lot of fun.There were several occasions where we would mock some accident victim and then get in fights with family or friends in the comment sections. In hindsight, I wish I could take those moments back, but they were fun. (Cheap comedy.)I used to be just as racist back in those days as I am anti-semitic these days, at least on the comment boards. I stopped making fun of blacks for some reason. They’re just not as much fun to pick on as they used to be. Part of me has started to feel sorry for them as they are a really pathetic group of people. Of course, the root of all humor is truth.There is also context. You can’t really make fun of Jews on the local boards. It’s just the wrong venue and Jews tend to be reasonably well liked on a local level, at least around here. It’s kind of like the old adage about your congressman being okay, but the others are the ones who are a problem. Ragging on the Jews fits better on national stories.Some people place more importance on what goes on in a comment section and take the comments more seriously than they should be taken. But in the process of being internet shock jocks, holes get poked in stories and a lot of truths get exposed that they would rather us not mention.

            whole time is that they are pathetic. That’s how they should be seen by us and they deep down know it too. They are a low race. And that’s ok.its some creepy weird alchemy that gripped the mind of the Anglo that he had conquered the world and now he can conquer human nature by turning these low people into us.there was a serious debate among serious people when the Portuguese first discover these people as to whether they were even human. This was a Christian world too; with serious people. No one is serious now and that’s gonna end badly.

            Before Trump emerged and “Russia” as we know it was invented, the regime excuse for shutting down the comments everywhere was “cyberbullying” (a lost word now), specifically of women. GamerGate—which oldfags know exploded from very minor press scandal to subject of UN inquiries (and USAID billions) due tocensorship on 4chan—was the peak of that angle, of total information control as chivalric protection of the saintly womenfolk (media) from terroristic incels (critics).(Always a “gate.” Everything is Nixon, as my aunt who still dresses like Stevie Nicks in assisted living will tell you. No insult intended, Z.)Twenty years ago, we were to be silenced for the muslims. In the Obama years, for the blacks. When Hillary was due her turn, for the ladies. Trump I: because Russia. Trump II (imminent): for “public health”—and oh, wait, also for the blacks again. Biden: for the trannies, the conscience of our nation, and for the war. Trump II (actual): for the Jews—finally.Through it all, we never changed.

                    That’s something I never liked about “Conservative Media” like Rush, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart, and Alex Jones. For 35 years they’ve said that the media lies and is libtarded, yet they paid attention to that same media all the time. Analogy: If you complain about the hot girl all the time, you pretty muchwantto be the hot girl.

                        Yes. These types are/were reactionaries, so it made sense for them to play video and audio clips and express outrage. The New Right is proactive in deed as well as spirit. Conservatives always were fakes, sometimes unconsciously so.
