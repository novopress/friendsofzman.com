        Whoever controls the language controls the social narrative, controls the policy, controls the nation. Time to start another language. This language will be called Truth. Learn it.

        “The exploding Mohamed”. Brilliant use of the language! Hard to obscure the meaning of that phrase. You must trademark that one immediately.

            @ Vic P, Z Man should make an exploding Mohamed action figure. Just press the button on his chest and watch all his spring-loaded appendages separate from his torso. Like the Rock’em Sock’em guys!

        This has been one of the big draws for Donald Trump. His forceful use of the language, the whole “non-pc” language that he uses. Puts the wreckers on the defensive finally.

        The bane of our lives in the UK, the BBC, always refers to muslims from these islands who join the fight for ISiS (or ISIL or whatever we have to call it now) as British men. Or British women in some cases.But they have never been British in the true sense of the word. There is nothing in their upbringing that endeared these people to the crown. Being born in the UK and hating everything about their free education, free healthcare and soft welfare services paying for their air fares to Turkey hasn’t made them the least bit British, yet these shaggy airheads trying to kill Christians and westerners — better still, western Christians — doesn’t in Al-Beeb’s eyes, deny them the title of Brit. It allows the horrified looks on the faces of the BBC newscasters to say “A British man was killed by Kurdish fighters,” and then it slowly emerges that the “Brit” was trying to kill Kurds or anyone else while shouting praise to a Saudi Moon goddess.

            Ha. We have the same thing here. If the news calls someone a “[fill in name of town] man” you know he is a foreigner. “Two Milford men” that robbed a liquor store will eventually be Hector and Pedro from Guadalajara.

        The Chinese, as in many things, were probably the first to enunciate this doctrine of statecraft:“A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.”— Confucius, Analects, Book XIII, Chapter 3, verses 4-7, translated by James Legge.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectification_of_names

            @ Christopher S. Johns Too true. I believe the only man we can look to now that has been so bold and fits this description is Hungary’s prime minister: Viktor Orban. He’s spoken no lies in his many speeches, where he takes to task the EU and their evil plans. He’s not held back in his description of exactly what muslims are, and how he doesn’t want them near his Magyars. I wish we had an Orban of our own, damnit.

        Sometimes you have to play the little word games.  I read this in the history books, but convincing Army and Marine officers to bribe Sunni Arabs to behave was a real tough sell.  It was against everything they had been taught since becoming cadets and wasn’t going too well.  Then Petraeus or one of his smart guys renamed it“money as a weapons system”and everything went swimmingly.  The alternative would be to get tens of thousands of dudes and dudesses to “reframe” their understanding of what was bribery and that it was OK in some situations.  The beat-downs would have been endless and nothing of any import would have been accomplished.The renaming is a cheat to avoid the reframing.  (I miss when we called frames “schema.” It made me feel smarter.)  It’s kind of amazing that something so simple is so effective — even working on a bunch of well-educated, hardened killers in fairly short order.  I guess that Scott Adams would call it the work of a Master Wizard, but it scares me to think that so many of us are so easily manipulated.

        I understand “framing” as a tactic, but what do you think about the people who seem to believe it?  Guys like George Lakoff, who invented “frames,” really seem to think that if they call it, say, “Patriotism Plus,” we won’t notice that it’s just plain ol’ technocratic socialism.  Are they just self-deluded academics, living in their bubble?  Or is there a whole other thought process here that I’m missing?

            The fanatic sees only that which confirms his fantastic. It really is amazing what people will do to maintain belief in something, even when the something is insane.

                It’s worth thinking of this in relation to NLP, which is all about changing the words we use to describe reality.The question is: does NLP work? It’s supposed to change attitudes and perception. For example, who would deal with an obstacle better, someone who thinks of it as a ‘problem’ or ‘obstacle’ or someone who thinks of it as a ‘challenge’? Surely the latter. So NLP enthusiasts would encourage someone who sees something as an obstacle to frame it as a ‘challenge’. The idea is for us to change the mental map we have of the world by changing the words. Another example, instead of thinking “I would like to do X but Y”, they’d encourage you to say to yourself “Despite Y, I would like to do X”, since the latter keeps your focus on your goals rather than the problem.They believe change can be effected through deliberately altering the words we use.What I do know is that once we talk about “Islamic Terror” it’s apparent that bringing in lots of Muslims from the middle-east is dangerous. If we’re in denial about there even being such a thing as Islamic Terror, then terror has nothing to do with Muslims/Islam and there’s no barrier to importing middle-eastern Muslim society.
