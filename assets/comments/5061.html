        Churchill makes no mention of stand-up here:“How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobiain a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in manycountries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methodsof commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophetrule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man ashis absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, mustdelay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceasedto be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendidqualities – but the influence of the religion paralyses the socialdevelopment of those who follow it.No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant andproselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa,raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianityis sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which ithad vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fellthe civilization of ancient Rome.”-Sir Winston S Churchill (The River War, first edition, Vol. II, pages248-50 (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1899).1 November 2005 – Australia

                Yes. Someone running for election made the mistake of reading it aloud in public at some sort of meeting or rally. He was swiftly  in trouble for his lips moving when he read it.

” But those in the Muslim community said the police were correct to act if Mr Weston’s actions were deliberately intended to incite hatred.
Mohamed Shafiq, leader of the Ramadan Foundation, said: “Of course there should be freedom of speech, but with freedom of speech comes responsibility. If someone was to deliver this message in the centre of Bradford for example where there is a large Muslim population then it could be seen as a deliberate act of incitement. “

        Moslems have no sense of humor, no joy in life or living. They are members of a Death Cult. I look forward to the Day of the Backlash. Followed closely by the Mass Expulsion.

        Sometimes I wonder whether people hold a wider variety of “odd” ideas these days, because no matter what those ideas might be, one can go to the Internet and find others who agree and “validate” the craziness.  Back in the day, one could only really share with the people close by, so the local judgements and norms would shut down many “non-mainstream” ideas.  In this way, the “odd” ideas did not find much traction.  But these days, whatever your proclivities and beliefs, validation for them is just a mouse click or two away.  And when “the powers that be” endorse them, then it is even easier to board the rather crowded “crazy bus”.

        I only saw the first 30 seconds before I barfed a little bit and had to shut it down, so I guess I just saw the promo.   Couric is such an easy “read”.  Here she was, in the “presence of comedy”, so she was ready to bust a gut at any inane thing.*This woman has had a 30+ year career based on nothing but perkiness and an ability to pull the heartstrings of her core audience, 80 year old grandmothers, who put down their knitting and stop feeding the cat kitty treats whenever she pops up on screen.There was a kernel of truth there.  Muslims are indeed not funny.  You get a few outliers, like Obeidallah and the half-Egyptian guy who used to appear on Red Eye, but as a general rule they make Mennonites seem like a weekend in the Catskills.* – Reminds me of the old Morey Amsterdam story—–“Amsterdam’s reputation for humor preceded him.  Hal Block tells of Amsterdam walking up Sixth Avenue and meeting an old friend.  “Where have you been?” the friend asked.  “Sick,” Amsterdam replied, “I’ve been in bed with a cold.”  His friend looked at him and asked, “What’s so funny about that?”

        I live in a latte town. The people here really do believe all this shit. The trans discussion is all the rage here- it’s “duh, of course you can be whatever gender you like”. Guys like me are the odd ones.
It might have to do with the notion, perhaps that since our modern world is so full of wonders, that we believe that human nature can be overcome. I don’t believe it can, but the folks you call the Cult do.

        The headline all western media has, ready to go after yet another muslim atrocity breaks, is clear:
‘(Nation’s/Town’s) Muslims Fear Reprisal Attacks.’
The fact that these ‘expected’ attacks never happen says a lot about both those who silently suffer the barbaric acts of our new friends and even more about our propaganda media machines.

            The irony they never get is that you can’t have a backlash without first having the front lash.
