        Does every 20 something travel with tens of thousands in cash?   I mean I made this much one summer at my limonade stand.   I never use checks, travellerâ€™s checks or credit cards.   I always carry used fives and tens, because it so much easier.   Oh, did I mention that I was going to California to become a rap producer, near Tijuana.   In fact, I plan to travel across the border often.   And you need cash, lots of it.
