        I am wondering: Am I the only one here who actively becomes irritable and anxious when I hear Harris? Her tone, attitdue, entitlement, etc. actively angers me, so that I have to turn it. I am not kidding- I have a physical reaction when I hear her. Never had this with any other politcian before. Anyone else?

            It’s not her. It’s the fact that she may be what we all know is coming. The End. She represents the last nail in the coffin. Anyone aware enough knows that what comes next can only be classified as collapse. It will no longer be what it used to be, a chipping away at our institutions.  Harris is a demarcation point in human history. That is what gets you.

                Well, to some extent, yes. But some idiosyncrasy, or simply that odious mix of stupidity and arrogance, offends me in a way that even Schumer cannot do, and he has far more influence than she does.

                    I’m more miffed at our own people and their lack of understanding of what it takes to preserve our culture and pass it to future generations. Whoever filled their brains with kumbaya over tribe, did an excellent job infiltrating and destroying our society. Parents have been asleep at the switch and maybe they’re not bright enough to understand these issues themselves.

                        ”Within the memory of living men the White North, over-whelmingly outnumbering the White South, placed the White South under the Negro. Now, in the year 1954, the White North, overwhelmingly outnumbering the White South, seeks to compel the White South to mingle with the Negro.
Not in the history of the white race was there a precedentto guide the overwhelming majority that is the White North when they seized a minor portion oftheir own flesh and bloodand! placed them under control of the Negro. “

                    I feel the same way. I felt it the first time I saw her talking on TV. There’s just something “off-putting” about her.
I’d like to think that it’s the type of reaction that most all sentient beings have towards the unnatural. Even though we can’t always verbalize it, we know deep down to stay away from certain people.

                This.If/when the election is stolen and she is installed, along with control of Congress, incrementalism ends and and the hammer drops.They will probably start with court packing. Then various constitutional amendments will be ‘enhanced’ to effectively end the 1st, 2nd and others.Any dissent will be suppressed. It will probably start with de-banking and arrest rather than violence, to prevent effective organized resistance.Basically, they will follow the Venezuela model rather than Cambodia.After the inevitable economic collapse that follows, CBDC and full surveillance will be part of the ‘reset’.Not saying this will all happen in year 1. But by the end of her 2nd term, I’d expect to see most of this.

                    Yes, but forewarned is forearmed. And no plan survives contact with the enemy. The chaos born of collapse is a fog that throws a monkey wrench into the works. When that happens, the backdoor will be open. Our obligation is to go through it and be both focused and decisive. They only win by default if we sit on our asses and do nothing.

                    I have my doubts about the whole CBDC thing.  They will never voluntarily give up their single biggest asset and enabler of all their adventures and wealth.  Even just banning cash would not be good for them, or at least has a lot of downsides.
Of course, I could be wrong, but it doesn’t seem especially likely.

                        One door closes, another opens.  If the required use digital currency is made law of the land, the power to control the populace will be infinite.  Think “homo economicus”, not “homo Sapien Sapien”
People for the most part trade.  When I was a small boy, I had to ask for a dollar or so to do anything fun on the weekend.  No different as an adult—except I control those dollars and give them to myself—if the wife lets me.  😉

                            “If the required use digital currency is made law of the land, the power to control the populace will be infinite.”There is a whole class of people who are never online, who barely understand how to use their phone, and who can’t even manage checks. Getting them to digital currency will be the work of Hercules, whatever the law.Have ATMs disappeared with most of the population defacto cashless as I type this? Landline phone booths are gone, but not ATMs.They may even try to require it for a year or two, until the things break down.I have bank that’s as digital as is even possible. They still have ATMs.All digital currency is simply the EV elite dream applied to money. It’s not going to happen, no matter how much they wish they could stop issuing bits of paper.

                                The stupidest people in American have zero problem with using their EBT cards. Hell, we provide such “digital currency” (an EBT card) to every IA who comes across the border. It will be no problem getting folks to swipe a plastic card rather than remove pieces of paper from a wallet. Certainly it will be arguably easier—since simple math and counting of change probably eludes them.ATM’s exist, because they have not been removed. They remain as a convenience for those who want to use cash. Wanting to use cash is not the same as “having” to use cash.In some Northern European countries, cash is almost nonexistent. Banks charge you to deposit it. I was unable to collect SSI without direct deposit—there was no option of sending those proverbial government “checks in the mail”. The IRS now demands electronic filing and payment, or you pay them extra for the option of sending them a check.  This may be restricted to businesses still, but I don’t handle that crap anymore.  I let the accountant handle.Even at this time, I rarely go anywhere, gas station, grocery store, restaurant, etc where I see either the person in front of me or behind me pay cash. They tap their CC or now often use the cell phone. That’s called “digital cash”. I note this, because I refuse to pay digitally, but always cash. Yet, I am stymied when shopping over the internet and therefore must use a CC.It actually will be a simple process once enacted into law. As with our new internal travel ID, enacted via State drivers licenses, and a generous 20 year changeover process, it can be easily done.Once digital currency becomes ubiquitous, cash will simply be made worthless.  Think of Korea and “script” changeovers to reduce the Black Market.  One week you use “red”, the next week you turn it in for “blue”.

                                    The US has many billions of Dollars in economic activity that cannot go cashless.  Believe it or not, I’m pretty sure drug sales and prostitution are part of the GDP.  They pull these numbers right out of the butts of the prostitutes.For me, it would really affect my love of flea marketing and “yard saling.”  I never have and never will use a card at a flea market, even if the vendor has the ability to accept them.  Presumably people will get around the cashless society with a foreign currency or small denomination silver coinage or some workaround, though it would be harder for large quantity drug transactions.We as dissidents should all use cash anyway.  I physically mail my bills in every month. I try to do most of my shopping locally, though this is not perfect.  But you can get around it.  You can buy a prepaid debit card, though I’ve never done it. For me, the downside is too large (they eat you alive with fees).There is absolutely no benefit to us by going digital.  In fact, everything you buy has a visa/MC tax built in.  Since CC surcharges are not legal, they just raise the prices of everything to cover that fee.

                                        One way of avoiding cash transactions would be a legal alternative.  Say a gift card you can be cashlessly purchased, but exchanged for drugs.  I’m sure other ways will be created.
However, illegal activities will never be a reason presented to the people to outlaw this digital currency push.  It will be exactly the *opposite*.

The other problem with the infinitely granular surveillance grid is that infinite cheap energy is required to run it.
The US grid is nowhere near capable of supplying that level of energy.

                            They have a bit of a contradiction to resolve. On the one hand they want to strangle the country’s energy supply to the point where people need to peddle to keep their computer on. On the other hand, they want everyone driving an electric car and 4K camera drones everywhere.I’m sure they think they will be able to impose some sort of automobile (and everything else) rationing, but this is predicated on a high quality surveillance workforce who believe in their mission. The reality will be Venezuela crossed with the Baltimore DMV. In a way this is good. NOTHING, including the police state, will work properly, and a bit of cash for bribes takes care of the rest.

                            Most money in creation today is *not* in terms of paper currency.  It’s already “digital”, just in theory exchangeable for paper.  Digital will simply eliminate that.  Perhaps slowly at first, but eventually everyone swipes a card at the check out counter and cash registers no longer have meaning or purpose.
What digital currency might do is control just when money is spent due to incentives to buy or not buy.  And of course those not in favor of the current regime may simply be frozen out of commerce.

                                It’s already digital, just as you say. Most of the population already does just swipe a card, particularly the young. However, very few places can afford to go cashless, even though the tech has been there for decades.I really don’t understand this dooms day scenario for a)something that already most exists and b)they have no logical way to port the rest of the people who do use cash.

                                    You make assertions not in evidence.  Every business can go cashless.  Yes, they need a device and perhaps a service to provide the exchange and there is a cost increase in doing business, but it is easily done.  Name a business where it cannot be done—lemonade stand, local dope dealer…?No one gives a crap if your business has such low margin that you can’t afford a couple of grand outlay.  No one seems to care about ubiquitous mandatory minimum wage laws that now are tied to inflation.  You think they care about a cash only smallvendor at the swap meet?Nope, it’s been done all over.  Including via cell phone access and devices tied into such—as in gun shows and temporary vending setups at concerts and such.As said before, there are no people who can’t use credit cards.  There are people who “won’t” use credit cards as a matter of principle and cash alternative.  But they can go screw themselves or get with the program.

                You just summed it up better than anyone. Weknow,but you’ve described the feeling. I’ve been sick — not physically, but mentally — for about two weeks. I’ve tried, very gently, to talk to family and friends about this situation. They laugh at me. I feel as if I’m walking in a Dead World, mourning the living.

                    Arthur: That was me back in 2008.   I realized what a disaster GWB was too late, but by the time of the abomination I saw where we were headed.  I have long since ceased all contact with family and former friends who denied reality.  I haven’t heard any politician’s voice since 2016 because I ceased watching TV altogether shortly thereafter.  Stop watching the carny sideshow that is politics.

                                Well, that’s what I’m saying. Most things he did other than the wars I can’t find too much fault with. I know people complain about Medicare part D and No Child Left behind, but those are small potatoes in my way of looking at things.I especially give him credit for the bailouts. He was able to set aside dogma and do the right thing. It would have been a major economic disaster if the government didn’t start throwing money around. We’re talking about people’s paychecks being lost and 401ks zeroed out as Banks failed.I know, I know, let the market take care of everything. But all that means is the people we hate, the banksters, picking up these temporarily failed companies for a song. That’s not a good result either.Besides, overall, the government made money on TARP.

                        I am proud to say that I have never listened to Obama’s voice any longer than it takes me to change the channel/turn it off/ leave the room/stick my fingers in my ears and hum. I don’t believe I’ve ever heard a complete sentence of his. When he announced he was running I read that he’d given a speech at a previous convention that swayed a lot of people to think he’d make a good president. Didn’t want to risk that.

            It’s just that she represents the way politics have become purely marketing and narrative-driving, and she is the embodiment of what marketers have become…bubbly, passive-aggressive, longhoused, incurious and emotive.
Though she’s a lady, and most ladies are tofu…they eagerly soak up whatever (cultural) sauce is around them. Blaming Kamala for being a tool is like blaming a black athlete for having multiple sexual partners.
It’s the hetero men who strike this tone which is offensive to me. Tim Walz, Jacob Frey, Beto O’Rourke, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Gavin Newsome, Mitt Romney, David French, Chris Christie, Michael Steele.

            Her voice and mannerisms are incredibly grating. But what’s worse:
She is the first double digit IQ politician who has a serious chance of winning.
The media has shown its full power like never before. Creating the impression, and then the reality, that she is smart and beloved is like when the USA dropped the first nuke. That the media can create this reality with such a stupid and unlikeable person demonstrates that their powers are much greater than we knew.
The media can make a majority passionately believe that 1 + 1 = 3.

                I had three family members red-faced, almost purple-faced, screaming at me in 2021 that I was going to kill my mother by not getting the Covid “vaccine.” These are financially successful people working in white-collar, intellectual professions. They know absolutely nothing and are completely empty inside. They are terrifying to me because in every setting (kitchen table, court room, dinner party) I lose to these people every time because they have the royal titles and writs. I am the loser. I am the one they go for, always, across time. I and many others.I’m pretty worried about what the next round will bring, to be honest. The hooks are in these people, completely. They are ready.

                    Democrats’ voters are way out ahead of the party. The propaganda has worked better than anyone imagined. The median Democrat voter (a browner than average woman) hates the median Republican voter (a whiter than average man) with a rage that’s beyond genocidal.Kamala and Walz is the firstaverage Democratticket—the first representatives of the new people they’ve built. They’re fucking maniacs.(I don’t know where Z’s getting the “Fudd” thing. Walz is a bitchy woman and that’s his media image, too. He’s “America’s Dad”from Twitter, not from the past or the woods. The hunter/state fair/etc. stuff is openly dishonest pretext—doubly ironic camp—to mock Vance as the creepy faggot he unconcealably is. The “weird” meme was appropriated from black Twitter. It meansgay. D ticket vs. R ticked = two women mocking two gay dudes. It’s genius—not electorally (that’s fake) but sexually. It’sgirl-brained.)

                        The interesting aspect (to me, anyway) of the quote is that one could—until Feminism of the 60’s—easily believe that Aristotle’s conclusion could be the result of male supremacy and the oppression of women.  Then came Feminism and ironically it proved Aristotle correct.  😉

            Kamala Harris is the first major politician I can think of who speaks with some vocal fry, aka “Female NPR voice.” I think there is something instinctively grating and annoying about it, and they know it, which is why they whine about guys talking about it. I think she tries to moderate it but when she really gets into it you can really hear it. It annoys some people more than others.Full disclosure, on some level, I kind of like Kamala Harris. I think she is probably a nice lady. She seems to have been a desirable female companion as a younger lady, so she was bringing something to the table. Yet, she has no business being anywhere near the levers of power. We all know she won’t be in charge if she was President. It’s going to be whoever is running the country now still in charge.

                The problem I sense, but admit to having difficulty to describe appropriately, is her level of stupidity.  That she is affable is not in question.  This of course fools people into liking her, or thinking she’s “OK or competent” outside of her deserved/observed niche.If you follow her, and stupid people in general, you see that they often stumble upon a vapid fact, or catch phrase, which they fall in love with.  They repeat such over and over again as if to impress or educate us.The video’s of Harris doing such abound and are scary.  A “gaff” every once in a while is to be expected of everyone in impromptu conversation, but that’s not the case with Harris.  There are videos of her vapid thoughts spilling out through her month and then repeated over and over again for audience after audience until she replaces it with another vapid pronouncement and repeats the process.

                    I’m getting down voted but yea, I don’t think she should be in power as I said. The great thing about these conventions is that you can see their playbook clearly. The Dems are going to play up her affability. She is not Clinton where even Dems didn’t like her. Something like the nasty person line Trump used would not land against her. She is not Biden where there were decades of him being a crooked dirtbag you could look up. The communist stuff is super weak. She may go the entire campaign without ever facing an unscripted question, where she could prove her low level of intelligence. She may not debate. The media is going to campaign for her AND ignore Trump, to an even greater degree than 2020. Her speech was pretty lame overall but most of the media treated it like a great triumph. Then Trump tried to go on Fox News to complain. It’s just a bad look. I guess the question is, what will triumph, narrative or reality. You look at the Obama “hope” stuff and yea, it’s fake and cringe, especially today, but it WORKED, and they’re running with the same playbook. I even saw an article on CNN that said “Voters have the chance to make history”, EXACTLY the same sort of thing they did to guilt trip Whitey into voting for Obama. Will it work?

            I believe Trump has this same effect upon a particularly vocal and influential segment of the population as well. It can’t be by accident that we have these two as our choices. This couldn’t have been designed any more skillfully to push the right psychological buttons of your average person from 2008 onward to both (a) take a superficial interest in politics (2) react emotionally to the characters presented on the television and on your phone.We’re no longer in the realm of minor political differences here — not really, c’mon — but friend and enemy, and each of these individuals (Harris and Trump) have particular personality quirks that really seem to drive average people to start issuing ultimatums in their private lives over politics to their families and friends that result in nothing but permanent social division. What’s worse, this isn’t friend/enemy in the Schmittian sense — this is friend and enemy on an emotional, psychological, almost pathologically imaginary level: people are seeing Nazis, Commies, Putin, Hitler, threats to their safety around every corner! You can’t have a normal society like this, which, of course, has been the goal.A decade of this is sufficient, I believe, to make people so angry that they become completely manipulable to whatever can be suggested to them with sufficient force and vivacity to produce action.

                        True. There is a tampon machine in the restroom of the brand new library branch near me. Never mind that the overwhelming majority of trans are males trying to be females, but do they really think that there are so many women trying to be men who need access to a tampon that they would go into a men’s restroom not having one on their person?

                    They rarely mention the more evil things he’s done, like turning the cops loose on people in his state with paintball guns to force them inside during covid.or how he worked hand in hand with the PRC to not only set up “police stations” in his state to go after dissidents, but he actively helped them round them up.Throw in the fact that he’s taken 300 trips to China in what amount of time? The Bidens are degenerate grifters, they’ve only ever been interested in the money, but Walz is a fellow traveller and a true believer. How else would one explain all of this? And more importantly, why aren’t Trump/Vance asking questions about any of this?

            I have the same reaction when hearing her especially when she does her blacktalking. You know, the fake ghetto affectations that she thinks will appeal to the Negroes. A few weeks ago I accidentally saw a clip of her sitting at her posh desk talking to some black person on the phone. Her words in answer to some question were exactly “giiiiirl, I’m out here in these streets!”. I didn’t know which was more offensive, the fact that she was obviously not out in any streets but sitting at a $30,000 mahogany desk, or the phoniness of her “black” accent. Notably, she mispronounced “these”. It’s supposed to be “deez”. In fact, I think she actually somehow sounded more fake than when Hillary, one of the whitest people who is not actually an albino, started doing her “black preacher voice” at some campaign event years ago. If you are an actual part-black and some creepy wannabe-Evita can out-black you, it’s time to quit.

            She’s the embodiment of the intersection of numerous negative societal trends. She’s a DINK (dual income no kids). These childless 40-50 year olds come with tons of baggage, and being Boozy is often one of those correlations. I would never want any leader with any kind of war making power to be childless, because you can’t possibly fathom the feeling of losing your child to war, especially pointless neocon projects.Her husband is Jewish (make of that what you will). She’s biracial Indian (dot, not feather) and African, but was primarily Indian up until recently. Oh and by the way she slept her way up the ladder “breaking in” to the business. To top it all off, she’s clearly not a high IQ person. I’d be shocked if she cracked 100-110. Yeah, it’s bad.

                        Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Bill, Black Jesus, really the whole Democrat inner circle, are all great arguments for abortion. Seeing any of them always makes me think of the Beavis and Butthead episode where they spoofedIt’s a Wonderful Life. The angel shows one of the two, Beavis I think, how wonderful the world would have been without him and tries to talk him into committing suicide.

        I haven’t felt it matters this little which one wins since 2000 when it was Bush v Gore. Trump isn’t even pretending to want to stop immigration anymore. They both will back Israel to the hilt. The trannyhomo parade will go on, just as we saw it pick up steam during his first term. Stopping the decline is not on the ballot.I had her speech on kind of in the background last night. I don’t know why I insist on doing this to myself. She presents well, strikes a good pose, as she utters meaningless, empty things. It seemed tailored to morons who are not interested in substance. Reminiscent of the Hope and Change campaign of 2008 in that sense. Perhaps it is an electorate of morons who do not deserve better. That goes equally for anyone who still thinks Trump is going to improve anything. The only thing he’s good for is making them mad. Which proves how vapid and childish they are, since he is no threat to anything meaningful.

            The election scarcely matters because the president, as is now pellucid, no longer runs the country. Dissidents have been saying this for quite some time, but now it is undeniable. Cackula and Trump will serve as puppets, and I think they’re just peachy with that. They’ll get the attention they crave; they’ll get to live in the Anti-White House; and they’ll get to fly all over the world to meet their fellow puppets. And on top of that, they won’t be burdened with any responsiblity and little real work. For many people, that sounds like a great gig.

            Correct. Trump just said that more immigration is great because we “need people.”   He did make an exception for “drug dealers and killers.”   So I guess all of the other crimes are A-OK.
More immigration of the sub-90 IQ variety is definitely not good for maintaining an advanced society.   Trump has lost the plot if he ever had it in the first place.

                That isn’t or wasn’t Trump’s position.  He believes in vetted and positive immigration.  That is to say, immigrants must be limited/regulated and of economic benefit to the country.  Hence, he’d favor granting foreign college grad’s resident VISA’s upon graduation.This obviously does those who wish to keep this country majority White, no good.  It also misstates a lot of the legal immigration requirements which are anything *but* selective and beneficial.  Trump is, or acts like, a “blank statist”.  In that way, he does little good for the DR.  Most argument I heard here is of the form, he’s better than the other guy.  A very weak argument indeed.

            Very well said. I will not get agitated about an ‘electorate of morons’ or people who think “Trump is going to improve anything.”  As my husband has said, at this point the only thing he cares about is improving our family’s economic position to survive the crisis (whetherfast or slow) we believe is coming in our lifetime.  We are not voting and we don’t expect significant improvement in anything thatreally matters.

            Watching an old episode of House MD on tv, there is a disease that results from a lack of a certain B vitamin, which causes the sufferer to take the last thing they heard and remake it to suit their story. I can’t remember the name of the disease, but Hugh Laurie came in to see the patient, and he had a shirt logo of a horse, and the patient immediately made of a story about her riding lessons etc, this sounds to me like an overload of alcohol may have killed Kamala’s supply of that vitamin..

                Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome? That’s caused by vitamin B-1 deficiency associated with alcohol abuse. It causes damage to short term memory. Not sure if it includes using random stuff you see to spin tall tales. Of course, the writers on House often took liberties with the details of the medical problems they featured.

            I’m still hoping for a Trump win so I can make a fortune on hydropower that I’ll generate from Lefty tears. Also, there’s a possible spike in Lefty suicides and that can’t help but “make the world a better place” to quote every beauty pageant winner. Tikkun olam, y’all!

        I’ve ignored all of the convention, except to see some commentary on it from our side. The one exception is that I did tune in to Obama’s speech. I wanted to listen closely to see how accurate your assessment of him was. It really was uncanny and ridiculous how little he says, how little he ever said, how valence-free and emotive his rhetoric is. It reminded me of the Kodos-Kang presidential campaign on “Treehouse of Horror.” Even down to Obama’s unctuous baritone, he sounded like the aliens: “We must not go backward. We must go forward. We must not divide. We must unite.” “And always twirling, twirling, twirling toward freedom!”The media has at last become savvy about just ignoring Trump. You’d think there would be a time limit on how long you can ignore an eight-hundred pound gorilla, especially after it just got shot and keeps coming. Another thing the dems/media have done correctly is waffling/triangulating on Israel. They keep it vague and feely, as on immigration. They want “reform” on the border and “peace” in the Middle East. Meaning open borders and letting Israel slaughter whoever they want, but at least they’re not saying it out loud. Trump, meanwhile, keeps bragging about giving the store away to Israel, trying to woo American Jews who hate him and puzzling most of his own followers.

            trying to woo American Jews who hate him and puzzling most of his own followers.Most American Jews hate him and will never vote for him but those are not the Jews he is speaking to when he lavishly praises Israel. He is speaking to the mega-wealthy Jews who control Silicon Valley and the banking industry. The Jews with enough brains to know how dangerous the current situation is both to their power and the existence of the state of Israel that they decided at the end of 2023 that Biden/Netanyahu needed to go and that Trump needed to be re-installed. These are powerful people who have conditionally backed Trump, those conditions being that he continues to do and say the right things with regards to the state of Israel.

                Well said.The ‘genocide’ Jews who seem to have captured the Democratic Party are never going to change their minds.Pres. Trump is hoping that the ’empire’ Jews love their own children (“to know how dangerous the current situation is both to their power and the existence of the state of Israel”) more than they hate us.It’s not a bet I would put money on, because he is asking them to side against their own kind, not just against a common 3rd party enemy like dot-Indians. Moreover, the only reason to even try is if the empire Jews have enough ballot fraud capability of their own to counteract the genocide Jews’ fraud. That remains to be seen. Ladybug Graham announced last week that GA Gov. Kemp’s “machine” (his word, attach your own meaning to it) was available to Pres. Trump. GA is a Sea Island Group property, which I view as a corporate client entity of the empire faction.We should never forget that the prerequisite for organization effort is money. You have to have loads of money to pay people, and mega-loads to pay the dwindling number of competent people. My take is that empire Jews possess the key civilizational control node of fiat currency manufacture.The genocide Jews (think Soros), and the numerous goyim allies of both sides (Pelosi, Clinton, Bush, etc) merely feed on the great streams of money that flow through the financial system after it is instantiated. So, the empire Jews may bet that in the long run they may be able to reorganize their efforts around their great strength and defeat the genocide Jews without needing any help from us. I think they would be wrong, but if the empire Jews were actually competent at running their empire, it would not be collapsing around their ears.

                Fine, but the smart tactic is still to take the Jewish money in private, tell the Jews in private he’ll do whatever they want, and keep mum in public, a la Kamala. Trump’s decision is stupid and alienating to his supporters who either like Israel but are more worried about their own country and its borders, or are neutral or hostile to Israel and are worried about their own country and its borders.

                It (elections) is a show for the “rubes”.  Elections also produce a lot of money for those involved in the “show” so there’s that incentive.  Elections are designed to convince the populace that they *do* indeed control the government and therefore have power over their destiny.  When the populace realizes that they are no better off, probably worse off, after the new rulers are installed, then (future) elections serve to distract from alternative methods of change—like revolution or uprising.

                You are correct. Many people here, including the blog owner, have disavowed voting, yet they follow the campaign obsessively.  Trump is somewhat of a con man but at least illegal immigration wasn’t nearly as bad in his first term..  That is enough to get me to the voting booth.  Now, on the other hand, if you are an accelerationist, then letting a pig like Harris win, is probably a logical decision.

                Certainly.  And since Trump will be in office for only 4 years does not the same portend after?  So you’ve perhaps you’ve bought us 4 years, but that assumes  “success” (whatever that means) during his administration.  If that is not so, are we better off waiting/delaying those 4 years?  These are unknowns.

                I’m not so sure, looking back at 1929-1933 in Wiemar Germany, Hans und Franz voted their way out of their mess. If the BOM taps into that same disgust with party politics and rides a democratic, legal revolution to victory like Mustache Guy did, the Left will go to civil war.

I appreciate the sentiment but I don’t think Z ever cited any examples where that helped the dissidents’ position.  Indeed, there are many counter examples where the moderating population went from getting very little to being sent to the gulag after they withdrew their participation.

                I do not plan to vote for either candidate this fall. I’d rather Trump win, but voting for him signals my approval of his plan to staple green cards to diplomas, to shill for Israel and support the Gaza genocide, to LEGALLY allow any immigrant in who isn’t a murder or drug dealer, and now, based on his post today on Truth Social, to protect “reproductive rights”, whatever those are. Nope, not going to do it. I cannot in good conscience support that. And voting for the Dems is a total nonstarter, especially after the past four days of Soyfest 2024. I’m in a pretty solidly blue state FWIW.If Trump wants to get back to his 2016 vision for America, I’m all ears.

                    Well, DR in a sense no.  But in a sense yes.  What do you call mandatory vexxination and quarantines, 20% inflation, an extra 20M illegal (POC) migrants installed, recession, and an additional $3T+ dollars *per year* to the debt?  Depends how one reads your comment.

        Apparently there was great angst that neither Beyonce nor Taylor Swift played for free. Some people actually opined that they were lied to so the viewership numbers for Harris’ “speech” would be higher.Such is the state of the modern dem youth voter’s “priorities.”

        Unfortunately I suspect that the powers-that-be believe that with enough fawning media coverage to provide support for the narrative, they can print enough ballots in the key swing states to deliver them to Harris and thus install her in the WH and banish Trump and his kind forevermore. Otherwise I think they’d have shoved Harris aside no matter what it took to install a more plausible candidate in order to run this play.

            I think the election comes down to who wants it more. TPTB probably don’t care whether Harris or Trump is in; they can use their psychological weapons against anyone in office.The Dems are highly manipulable, zealous, and have retard strength. They aren’t happy unless their Dear Leader is telling them platitudes on their preferred newsgathering sites.Trump-Republicans are a fan club, but they love grilling and God and complaining about Liberals more than they want their Dear Leader elected.Legacy-Republicans are just weak and feckless as we all know.If Harris wins, which she probably will, poorer Trump-Republicans will flood into social media and richer ones will fund lawsuits which will go nowhere.If Trump wins, which is unlikely, the Democrats will go to war.

                Even if Trump wins, he’ll be, like in his first term, hamstrung at every turn by the intelligence agencies, entrenched bureaucracies, opposition by the Uniparty in both Houses of Congress, especially the Senate, the media, etc. If the Dems regain the House they’d probably impeach him all over again on Jan. 21.
Essentially, the swamp will just wait him out. Four years and then he’d be gone for good. Assuming the Secret Service doesn’t just have another Butler moment with a better marksman behind the rifle next time.

        Well that is about as fair and an objective analysis as you’re going to get these days, Z. But… when ya gotta start accounting for “margins of cheat”…? One has to wonder if any analysis is valid or meaningful. Anything is possible. I personally think that it is high time to start stretching necks and busting skulls over on that side of the political divide myself… you can’t run a country like this, and if it continues America will be another Utopia for coloured morons and white lunatics.

        I’m looking forward to listening to it, Z. I think the Dems put on a much better, more focused show than the Republicans, and they have the entire media apparatus behind them. The hagiography of Kamala is insane – the one video they played before her speech claimed that she, basically, laid the groundwork for how the entire American justice system operates today – but you say it enough and people will believe it. They are giving her the Obama treatment, but they had five years to cultivate the Obama character and only three months for Kamala. Her speech was basically a summary of everything said prior, nothing new but in line with the focused messaging. I thought it was kind of funny how she claimed to be a President for all Americans then immediately went into a “deplorable” style attack on Trump supporters. The Dems have been doing this so long I am not even sure they realize they are doing it.But, on the other side, Trump’s speeches are rambling and low energy and his attack lines are lame. The “communist” line is lame. It’s not going to work with anyone under 60. It’s not a scary word anymore. You can say a lot of things about Kamala or her speech but “communist” is far down the list. The attacks on Walz are better. He’s genuinely a weird and creepy guy, which is probably why he lobbed that at Vance. A football coach who set up the gay club, not that long ago this would have led to whispers from parents (and it surely did when he did it). The “Tampon Tim” line hits, but in the end he’s just the VP. He really doesn’t matter.

            When I hear her say she wants to unite, and be a uniter, I think how it would be so easy. All she has to do is pardon the J6ers. Everyone would exhale. But she just doesn’t have it in her. I don’t think she has one original thought in her. Which is why I don’t fear a Kamala presidency. It will be the same govt by bureaucracy with a puppet president that we are accustomed to.

                Trump governed as a uniter. He could have moved to put Clinton in jail. He could have moved against the entire Obama operation after Russiagate. Instead he let the process play out and let people who hate him define his entire presidency. And look what it got him afterwards.Yet, Trump also tried to make unity a theme of his presidency after he got shot. I think he is still trying. Look at how it is working out. He said he respected Obama a few hours before Obama built an entire speech around taking shots at him. It just makes him look pathetic and weak. It’s not working. He needs to remember that these people hate us and want us dead and that includes him.He needs to go on the attack.

                    In Trump’s defense, “lawfare” was not a thing prior to his taking office and especially after his leaving office.  If anything, he illustrates an old admonishment of Z-man’s (IIRC) wrt letting one’s virtues be used against you by your enemies.
Just another reason I hope Trump wins in 2024, it will be interesting to see if he’s learned anything in street fighting.  Yes, this perhaps is along the lines of “watching the world burn”, but time is short for me and the world is very large.  😉

                    Indeed. I believe it was Lao Tzu who said “Always treat the enemy as the enemy because he will invariably treatyouthat way.”Again, this is something I have never understood about him. When he decided not to go after Hillary over what she did, Bannon I believe told him that it was a monumentally bad decision that would come back to haunt him. Instead, he listened to the swamp creatures surrounding him when they told him, “We don’t go after former presidents, or first ladies.” If this happens again – should he manage to eke out a victory…………

        The wild card for me is that it’s unknown just how good their stealing operation really is? Does it include not just meat space ballot manipulation but electronic too? Are we dealing with a ghetto operation capability or a Elon Musk IQ type operation capability?We just do not know?I think we will know if like 2020 Trump is leading into the evening but by the next morning we hear doubts and that all the votes have not been counted yet.2020 caused me a crisis in my outlook on what can happen and until 2024 proves it won’t happen again I am going to be concerned. I just can’t look at polling and count on anything after 2020.

        As usual, tons of quality comments by the contributors.My two cents is that, while I prefer Orange Man over the plank of wood running against him, I think that installing The Street Shitter would finally get whitey off the couch. I might be kidding myself, but we all know intuitively that it’s going to take much more pain and privation to provoke a reaction that is meaningful.Tucker had a neighbor on recently that related a thought that struck home. It’s the way I feel about my family and tribe.He said,”It doesn’t matter how much stuff you have (water,food, ammo), if people are not prepared mentally, there will be no surviving the shit storm that is coming.And most, quite frankly, are not mentally in the game.

One can only wish.  However, I think that the only way to get Whitey off the couch is to light it on fire.  The “couch” in this case being a metaphor for comfort and (perceived) survival.  Whitey has sold his soul for the promise to be the “last one eaten”.

The metaphor pertains to Ulysses’s meetup/contention with the Cyclops in Homer’s Odyssey.  In exchange/reward for more wine, the Cyclops promises to eat Ulysses *last*.  Somehow this has always stuck with me since childhood as a basic lesson in human behavior.

        Something else that occurred to me after (unfortunately wasting my mental energy) dwelling a little further on Momala’s slick and polished presentation last night….. After witnessing the Ds be able to do that over and over, going back to Clinton and Obama, they come up with some slick talking huckster who does well with a teleprompter, substance be damned, and this works for them. It speaks to just how incompetent, useless, and deliberately feckless the GOP really is, that not once, NOT ONCE in the 40 years since Reagan have they been able to produce such a candidate who can perform the basics of being appealing with a teleprompter. NOT ONCE. You wouldn’t think it would be that hard. The Democrats prove it’s not that hard. Over and over. You’d think it might happen once just by accident. Yet somehow the GOP is just unable (or is it deliberately unwilling) to find any smooth talkers with any charisma to read slick empty speeches.Moreover, in hindsight, and upon reflection, it is even more glaring that during the campaigns of one of their (many) teleprompter failures, Dubya, that coincidentally it was at this same time that the Ds failed to produce any sexy talkers to counter him. A person could get the idea that it was rigged for Dubya those 2 times just based on the Ds extremely lackluster efforts to defeat him.

        The Vance/Walz contrast is interesting. My wife pointed out that when you look at their photos side by side, Vance does look a bit weird and Walz looks pretty normal. But when you actually hear them speak, the effect is reversed — Vance sounds like a normal guy, while Walz sounds like a creepy weirdo trying to imitate normal people and failing badly at it.
Their debate will be fun to watch. Vance might pick up a point or two for Trump after people actually see him next to Walz.

        Trump running around blaming Biden/Harris for the inflation is comical.  Trump publicly called on Powell to lower the interest rate many, many times.  Then there was all the money printing in 2020 and the stimulus checks and the free money through the SBA. Then there was the second stimulus check Trump signed off on.  The debt was 10 trillion Dollars in 08 and is 35T now.  Probably most of that debt was printed in some way over the last 16 years.

            It’s completely inane, just as it is for the local MSNBC-Bots put out signs blaming Trump for x% of the inflation mess as their guy did less nothing to try and fix it (and didn’t think to blame Trump until Just Now).
However unlikely it is though, there are things Trump might do (that the inner party won’t) to stem inflation that don’t require touching the government debt that’s generating the bulk of it.

            If basic supply-and-demand econ is true—I’m willing to grant it’s not—interest rates have no effect on inflation. Think about it for a second.I do understand “wages cause inflation” libertarian types blaming Trump. He sent everyone a few of their stolen dollars back and he didn’t call it a tax refund. Being a libertarian means identifying with finance capital—the rightful first, second, third, fourth, fifth, [etc.] spenders of all money. The citizen’s only role in the economy is to “invest” (give his wages back to finance) and stretch his anus for the bosson his own time. Imagining the average man gettinganythingfrom money—any pleasure or relief, however fleeting—enrages the libertarian, so he lashes out at the average man’s representative (in handy target orange). Totally reasonable.Did prices go up when the checks went out? Some did, with other causes. “Collectibles” were the only obviously inflated market (since crashed). There was a delay—various delays for various regions, sectors, industries, etc.—before the new inflation hit everything. If those delays don’t break libertarian causality, explain. What route did all that money given to regular hot-dog-chugging losers take that took it untilthis weekto become $15 for less than a handful of bratwurst? It was a third that price for twice as much when the loser checks werespent.I know there’s a story, one for every hot dog. It’s never “Inflation is caused by people having money.” They don’t even have it!

                i need more explanation about how the asset thing works. Is part of his message a lie? Is the campaign run from cia? Does he mind misleading millions of people ? His staff and volunteers?the problem I have with things like that or that George Floyd and Ashley Babbitt are sitting on a private beach on some island with new noses is that there would have to be a be a whole back story and forward story that I have never heard.how did rfk become an asset what is his motivation? Does his family know? How do the cia know he won’t mess up and tell someone?im not saying he isn’t I just can’t see how this works.its like a misreading of human nature: there is a class of people that are like gods, they can lie with no problem, for decades and they are so psychopathic that they can be COUNTED ON to continue to lie.I don’t know.

                    The way I picture this, the “CIA” doesn’t really care about 90% of what goes on in politics. So, as their asset, you’re free to do what you want the great majority of the time. But on the stuff they do care about, you’re there for them. You might even get sent a specific message occasionally.

                            OK, define “gatekeeper”, then specifically point to examples of Shapiro being a gatekeeper.  Your complaint (slur) is exactly the same as *everyone* I’ve seen from this group.  There may indeed be such a thing as “gatekeepers”, but rarely do I see anyone pony up with their definition and examples thereof.  Not that I like Shapiro.  He and his organization are more for the dollars and status than those I pay attention to.

There’s another site I visit where an obvious Libertarian is arguing for the legalization of Mary Jane. By his line of argument and his attitude that comes across in his posts, I now know why Z says “When you meet a Libertarian, punch him square in the face. He’ll know”.

        Well, Ford and Hoover had a long talk about Hale Boggs after Boggs started criticizing the FBI. Ford I guess had a long-running interest in single-engine aircraft, along with Hoover, apparently.
Let’s hope Kamala isn’t like Ford. God help us if she has anyone like Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Kissinger at her right hand.

            That’s the point isn’t it. Her “right hand” is bound to have a great influence since she has no mind of her own.  She is an empty vessel of no understanding waiting to be filled.  She is the proverbial dimwit that takes the position of the last person in the room who speaks.

        mr. Z. During your podcast, you didn’t spend very much time talking about vote rigging. In fact, you only made one or two sentences in passing and really didn’t analyze it at all. Except for the state of Nevada.
Nothing has changed over the last four years to prevent this. Because the vote rigging has not been corrected why would you expect a different outcome from 2020?

            I have written and spoke ta length about the rigger problem. I mention some thing that I think change the rigger problem. The governors of Michigan and Pennsylvania have reason to keep the riggers home this election. Both have their eyes on 2028. Arizona now requires proof of citizenship to vote. There is also a distinct lack of enthusiasm for rigging compared to 2020.

I moved out of the city but i’m still in a heavily democrat area. That is most def true, i’d say for both sides. People are just tired of this shit.  Perhaps that is the goal?  Like a child that asks the same question over and over until the parent finally relents

            They are and have been for years now. Last time I was Stateside, before Corona hit, I noticed a marked increase in prices, I swear that was a 1/3 jump then. They certainly are a lot more “eco friendly” too. Hardcovers are overpriced and garbage quality.

            Publishers set retail prices, so the cost is printed on the books. A bookshelf is an inflation graph. Books of the same physical quality have at least tripled in price this century.But books of that quality are pretty much unavailable. They’re collectors’ items, sold as “support” for the authors (and publishers) at souvenir prices, like Japanese idol merch ($100 for an unwearably ugly and small tshirt of your oshi).A Bronze Age Pervert paperback is ~$15, which feels normal, but it’s printed so badly it’s almost unreadable, using worse materials than a ’90s underground punk ‘zine (typically $0 + postage) and it won’t last as long. Hardcovers are twice as much, which feels normal, but they’re printed on translucent toilet paper like free bibles used to be, and they crumble in use.It’s a depressing “quality of life issue” for book guys (endangered).

        I’ll try to write something serious instead of my usual trolling, having listened to most of the ep so far.My thinking on going after Vance for being ‘weird’ is the wahmen angle, it is like calling him creepy with cooties, and I think it could be effective especially to low info voters (which is wahmen in particular).The dems likely view their win condition and best chance as converting white wahmen, and I agree with them, it’s a good strategy.I also think Vance is creepier and weirder than that other guy, Vance is awkward and if a wohmon was going to play FMK, he’d be getting the bullet. It doesn’t matter if you as a man give him a pass due to his competence, or he shares the same autistic hobby as you or whatever.The other guy seems like a non-threatening uncle, or the jovial simp orbiter to Kamala. I also don’t think comparing him to Elmer Fudd is a good strategy, because that just humanises him and makes him further endearing and non-threatening.The “weird” label has a wider resonance because at this point almost everyone IRL knows someone that went off the deep-end with Q, Flat Earth nonsense or whatever that “The elites are extracting adrenaline from children’s eyes!” thing was.I was really optimistic and supportive of people breaking away from the mainstream during Corona, ‘radicalising’ people, in my old libtard terminology, but it seems like a good chunk of them immediately drifted off to be preyed on by grifters and lunatics. They wanted to escape the prison island, but they simply aren’t up to the task of navigating away from it and wound up lost at sea.*Regarding Fuentes saying the campaign is failing, I don’t take that at face value, I see it as him trying to maneuver into a position of more influence regardless of the facts. And I’ll take that over GOPe slop every time.*Basically, the NPC problem. You can flash their firmware, but they’re going to malfunction if you don’t given them a new script to follow.

            My label for Walz is pedo. Cause there ain’t no other type who takes it upon themselves to coach teens on their sexuality and tell them to embrace their gayness. There may be some shitlib pink hair women who do that because they think it’s the virtuous thing nowadays, but there is only one kind of “man” who does that. If you lined him up next to Sandusky and Hastert he wouldn’t seem out of place at all, would he?

            Z-man isn’t the only one doing it this.This election is rather revealing about the character of the “dissident right”.There are guys who I thought had an understanding of how awful Trump’s first term come circling around to be Trump schills.Hunter Wallace of “Occidental Dissent” has been even more obnoxious about his newfound Trump support after whining about Trump throughout his first term and then refused to vote for him in 2020.I find it amusing that Vox Day has swapped places with these guys 2020 v 2024.  The “Trump slide cometh” debacle seems to have humbled him a bit and he has been much more down on Trump this cycle.If we aren’t voting our way out of this, then why is so much of the dissident right upset about Harris’s poll numbers?What is happening now with the pro-Harris media is completely unsurprising.  Trump was terrible president and left has always had the media in the bag.The Lucy’s Football of the Big Election just seems to short circuit peoples brains who should know better and spending their energy on alternative means of dealing with our problems.

                    I think the explanation is that most of us–myself included–are still habituated to the traditional political process. Even though we know objectively that Our Democracy is a farcical scam, and that pretending otherwise is foolish, we’ve marinated in this slop for so long that it’s hard to completely purge it from our being. Thus we bounce back and forth between the two poles you describe. But, with the passing of time, I think you’ll see less of this. At some point our transition to pure cynicism will be complete.

                As for the coming around to Trump, a lot of it has to do with how horrible this current administration is.  Sure, Trump was a bad (more realistically a “meh”) president, but compared to Biden (and now Harris) he’s freaking George Washington.

I do understand the weariness you are feeling over the election coverage and that long segment on polls was rather boring, but it’s not a knitting site.  It’s a political site.
