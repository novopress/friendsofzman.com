        Good podcast. I have to disagree (for now) that the establishment is just going to ignore Trump, for both practical reasons and fanatical reason. Ted Koppel had a point when he told the porcine, rubber-lipped lizard man from CNN (Brian Stelter) that Trump is good for the ratings. The news about Blumpf will technically be ‚Äúsoft‚Äù most of the time, but there will be so much sadism in the reporting (‚ÄúWatch Blumpf the fat white Oaf miss this easy Putt on his Golf Course‚Äù) but that will harden more normie white hearts. That brings me to the fanatical aspect: These people are empty and would prefer to fire arrows into a corpse staked to a tree rather than run the risk of looking in the mirror. Look at how long they‚Äôve been haunted by the ghost of Nixon (a guy who ended the War, normalized relations with China, floated ‚Äúnegative income tax‚Äù half a century before Andrew Yang, and created the first genuine opiate program in the country). Like most people who voted for Trump, I didn‚Äôt really like him. But these people have been so sadistic to him that they‚Äôve managed to sort of do the impossible, beatifying this bloated real estate salesman into a whipping boy for all the sins of White America.Yes, it is a bit like Weimar. The left derived no end of satisfaction from the humiliation they visited upon the deposed royalty in Weimar Germany. They even had former royals performing in Kabaret shows for their amusement. I learned a simple lesson from that history and it‚Äôs the same as the lesson I learned in Iraq. Careful who you humiliate. Especially when they‚Äôre powerless.

            Iraq, our ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù cough gag of Iraq has many lessons for us.For example the COVID restrictions are essentially a mild DeBaathification for whites, small business, etc.  So are the constant humiliations and degradations.The loss of control of crime and gangs, political movements with guns in the cities, etc.  There is something very wrong with our elites far deeper than ideology, the constant impulse to insult and degrade others is a defect.
If only Stalin knew, he‚Äôd never let the Communists act this way, certainly not in public.*This was part of Stalin‚Äôs actual rule you know.*

            Considering that German and Irish are the majority strains in the largest white tribe outside of Europe, combined with the outstanding traits and history of the rest, their militance and their savage treatment by other tribes-

careful, that tinder is stacked high and deep.

                They‚Äôre probably going to regret awaking certain long buried traits.  Probably.  Of course they love to stir up trouble and poke animals [in their view] with sticks.Then cry out after they strike you. &lt; diseased.

            If I‚Äôm understanding you correctly, I agree that (((they‚Äôve))) been able to make something of a martyr out of Trump with this non-stop 4-year harassment and criticism.  There is no one but the (((media))) to blame for this situation.  Sure, there are Whites who despise Trump, but were it not for the (((media))), their numbers would be a fraction of what they are now.  (((They))) create their own problems and then cry anti-semitism when non-Jews shine a light on it.

        ‚ÄúPut the right group of people in the right situation and you get behavior that seems to spring from nowhere.‚ÄùExactly right. The scolds, the cowards, and the barbarians don‚Äôt ‚Äúspring from nowhere‚Äù ‚Ä¶ that behavioral DNA is part/parcel of humanity. But my family, community, and culture taught me, from breast to manhood, that busybodies, sissies, and lowlife knuckle-draggers were the scum of humanity ‚Äì not to be tolerated, and certainly not to be emulated or celebrated. That‚Äôs what my culture did for me ‚Äì transition me from selfish/prideful boy into a civilized man.Heaped on top of that was a healthy dose of southern gentility ‚Äì it was understood that every village had their idiot, and while we must be charitable, we should never hire them for anything other than janitorial service.Yet today we have the right group of people (scolds, cowards, and barbarians ‚Äì idiots all) in the right situation (where they are tolerated, emulated, and celebrated ‚Ä¶ and they RULE.)

            Yes, and these idiots will continue to dominate the rest of us until some counter-force arises to change that. Some believe that community organizing is that force. While others believe that voting will eventually prevail. Yet others believe that we will simply ‚Äúmuddle through‚Äù this malaise and life goes on, so in the words of Alfred E. Neumann . . .

                A counter-force is absolutely necessary and is under development; we have Trump to thank for adding many to our numbers. Still, our side has an unfortunate tendency to divide into impotent cliques ‚Ä¶ instead we desperately need alliances.It‚Äôs not in everyone‚Äôs DNA to be a 21st century minuteman, but if I‚Äôm going to pick up a rifle I want to know that there‚Äôs a community behind me, a church that‚Äôs praying for me, and that the muddle-through ‚Äúneutrals‚Äù won‚Äôt be grassing on me. It seems we‚Äôre both pointy-end-of-the-spear types, but we also need some fellow travelers in the rear with the gear.  And a well-networked and robust community for my family is crucial, as every combat vet knows.

                    Yes, living among like-minded people is a valuable resource and support system, which is why I advocate for moving into a rural community. Clans evolved in Europe because they ‚Äúworked‚Äù, not because someone talked them into it. But a successful war against modern tyranny cannot be won the old fashioned way. A new paradigm is necessary. The paramount goal is to win, not die bravely.

                        ‚Äú‚Ä¶which is why I advocate for moving into a rural community.‚ÄùCouldn‚Äôt agree more.  After military retirement I brought my brood to a small farm ‚Äì best decision of my life.  But relocation ‚Äì in and of itself ‚Äì isn‚Äôt enough.  If we‚Äôd melded with my rural community my clan would be as lost and helpless as ever.Once settled in the heartland, our people need to remove their kids from the government schools ‚Äì period.  We need to raise young people that know how to shoot, grow food, cook, and amuse themselves without teevee.  They need to hang with entrepreneurial parents and neighbors, learning a trade, and cultivating partnerships and alliances.  I could go on, but the crux is that our people need to SECEDE from the existing paradigm before any possibility of a paradigm shift.  I‚Äôm not interested in talk of war unless/until I see fellow patriots who are willing to endure some inconveniences ‚Äì who are passionate about their walking the talk.Those who are unwilling or uneasy about yanking their beloved children from public schools are fundamentally incapable of pulling off a revolution against tyranny.  The hearts and minds of our side just aren‚Äôt there yet.

        Is the Trump we wanted Emerging?   Against all previous analysis and judgment ‚Äì cold judgment ‚Äì that Trump is purging DS all round (he just dumped a bunch of DS neocons including Kissinger from Defense policy board yesterday) I am beginning to whitepull on Trump.   I hate to sound Q-ish, and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a plan, but what he is doing are not the actions of concession. I am only looking at facts not consistent with concession.   Not to mention the legal cases in GA and MI, and the nationwide PR disaster of using Dominion, the sub amateur vote dump at 0400, etc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think Trump will give up.Is Trump suddenly ‚Äòemerging‚Äô into the man we wanted all along? Driven by fear if nothing else?A House of Representatives election ‚Äì 1 elector per state ‚Äì is far from hopeless.

            A U.S. House election is one option. Another is that GOP-led state legislatures appoint GOP electors after being shown massive vote fraud. Yet another is that one or more courts halt action by the electoral college. And stillanotheris that several swing-state elections are outright reversed‚Äîeither by court or state legislative action‚Äîgiving wins to Trump. We are living through a stunning historical moment, with the outcome yet in doubt.

                Having that many paths to victory is very Sun Tzu.
So was disassociating from Sidney Powell¬†and allowing her to operate independently.
The Flynn pardon is strategic in the sense¬†that it nullifies Judge Sullivan‚Äôs ability¬†to use his lawfare campaign to distract Sidney¬†and team from the all-important electoral fraud effort.
Feeling a lot¬†better about¬†the Trump lawfare effort than¬†I did last week.

            It‚Äôs as if our President is quickly following the path of enlightenment we have all taken (but four years too late, IMO).

                Snakes can be eliminated, ProZ. It takes time, but everyone knows there is no place in the new GOP for snakes (not to mention other swamp creatures). True, we‚Äôll never be rid of them entirely, but that doesn‚Äôt constitute an Achilles Heel, merely a problem to be managed.

            Trump will do nothing to protect our rights to speak or assemble.¬†Trump will not get us out of any foreign entanglements.¬†Trump will do little about mass immigration.
We are his booty call whom he calls when he has no one else.¬†He spent all of his time trying to appeal to Javanka‚Äôs friends: global finance,¬†jews, blacks, hispanics, and trannies.
Only when his back is against the wall and no one else answers his calls does he do a small amount on immigration, border security, election fraud, free speech, or endless wars.
Nonetheless, Trump is better than Biden.

                Dear Sir,Even TNR/ The New Republic noted that under Trump there was an egalitarian economic revival, which of course COVID and the lockdowns reversed.We have 500 new miles of wall, BTW, and I can go on.Just ending TPP was a massive blow he spared us.He didn‚Äôt start any new wars, and did his best to end the ones we have.  He tried in person to open North Korea.All this while fighting off coups, and now a stolen election- all for the little he did for us, which was quite more than a little until 2020 and the lockdowns.It‚Äôs true he reached out to people you hate, and who hate us.  That‚Äôs not unstatesmanlike.As far as not going far enough‚Ä¶and what have you done?  If it‚Äôs the line in the sand, me too. Recursively.Following orders weren‚Äôt we? Well Trump is following the Laws, he has all along.  Foolishly in my view.The President is not a dictator, and as we now see he‚Äôs not even President‚Ä¶because above all else our enemies have completely and madly exposed all their machinations.  The Deep State, the electoral fraud, the coup attempts by the Deep State, the media, tech‚Ä¶all unhinged, all taking power that will hang by the merest threads‚Ä¶those threads being our own inertia.You don‚Äôt even want a dictator, you want a God.Not even Stalin or Mao got there alone‚Ä¶and Trump is alone.  We are in no position to criticize his tweets and his powerlessness when that is our own same choice- complain, but do nothing.

        The based Jew, the based Korean, the based Nigerian or whatever you fancy, always causes me some suspicion. Seeing that race is a significant factor in loyalty, I‚Äôd rather not have to deal with these fifth columnists.Naturally, when we must live in other communities we will choose the based Jew as a neighbour over a soppy white middle class leftist; but when defining our own community, I am afraid I would consider Mr Solomon Goldstein a liability. This does not mean there can be no functional relationship between different communities ‚Äì but exclusion of people not matching certain base criteria must be maintained. Being white would be necessary but not sufficient.

            Separation/Segregation doesn‚Äôt need to imply no interchange or interaction. Since Tom Metzger died (Jim Goad‚Äôs eulogy is worth reading), there are all these old clips of him online. The Whoopi Goldberg interview was an enlightening reminder that America used to sort of take the free speech thing serious. Just like with Jared Taylor or Pat Buchanan, most of the times they tried to set him up, the interviewer came off liking him. There would be a lot less racial animosity if we weren‚Äôt foisted on each other against our will. They could visit and conduct business with us. I doubt they would want to do more.

        Cross-breeding of plants can result in a characteristic that does not exist in the two plants that have¬†been crossbred by a curious gardener. Domestic animal breeders, from time to time, will bump into this. The Ocicat is a great example crossbreeding two animals and getting a result that has qualities not present in the parents. Insects colonies are a great example of emergent behavior.I‚Äôm gonna geek out a little bit b/c that stumbled on one of my interests, zoology and also I‚Äôm kinda enjoying a slight break from politics. So if this is too OT apologies and the host feel free to delete. Maybe I have a comment later on the politics of the show, who knows.Cross-breeding; there is a theory that the red wolf, which is a very rare form of wolf found primarily in North Carolina today, is actually a natural cross-breed between the grey (or ‚Äònormal‚Äô) wolf and the coyote. This is different from, say, a mule or a liger (a cross between a male lion and female tiger) b/c it is not that every red wolf is a cross between a grey wolf and coyote but that they may have cross-bred thousands of years ago and that gradually gave rise to a new form of wolf, inbetween them in size and temper. Today tundra grizzlies are running into polar bears in Northern Canada and Alaska and they have also cross-bred. Possibly they will give give rise to a new bear suited for the high north??The more general point is that traditionally evolution is seen as species branching out from a parent species by random mutations that happen to confer some survival advantage. But the opposite process, species merging to form a new species, or if you will, branches on the tree of life, fusing, is probably also an important mechanism. It has happened in human history; all non-negroids have Neanderthal DNA to varying degrees. Modern man MAY be a merger between those that left Africa 150,000 yrs ago and Neanderthalers. If we view it thus, blacks are not technically ‚Äòmodern man‚Äô. But on the other hand, it seems Africa, the largest tropical region in the world (and tropics have the highest biodiversity and -density) is where things, from elephants over big cats (the lion in neolithic times was found all over the world outside Australia and maybe South America) to great apes and even superbugs ‚Äòburst out from‚Äô. And we may be seeing that with humans again. I call this the ‚ÄòAfrican pressure cooker‚Äô theory and it may, or may not, be a general rule. Anyway this is getting too longwinded and whether anyone wants to draw any potential political implications from this I‚Äôll leave to you guys. Thanks for reading this far to those who did lol üôÇ

                Haha I‚Äôve always been interested in animals. I went to Africa as a student, that‚Äôs where I picked up my moniker. I think Africa is a must-see, it‚Äôs life w/o cushions or safety rails.

                    You really should look into the origins of cows and probably wild horses and really ANY domesticated animal or even plant.If you found wolves in Africa (maybe you do, I don‚Äôt know), you could tell a GREAT story about how wolves are just too wild and too vicious for domestication.This is one of the dumbest arguments Jared Diamond makes in guns, germs and steel. No domesticated animals is proof that there were no animals suitable for domestication. We have all kinds of staple foods whose ancestors were basically not edible.  Some Russians domesticated foxes in a few generations though changes to their coats made the domesticated animals useless. Looking at a wild version of some plant or animal and concluding that it is just not suitable for being domesticated is just a failure of imagination.

                        Hehe reality is always more complex than a brief comment on a blog allows for. I actually largely agree w you. But take bovines. Buffalo Bill killed thousands of American bison and was never harmed, many others had similar records. And this is in the black powder days, not modern cordite  magnum rifles.Even today, w modern big game hunting rifles, PH‚Äôs (professional hunters) are wary of the African buffalo even though it is smaller than the American bison. Big game hunters during the Brit Empire were in the best position to judge b/c they could hunt African buffalo, Indian water buffalo and gaur and bison in Canada w/o ever leaving the empire. None of the others, w the partial exception of the Indian water buffalo, ever had a reputation even close to that of the African buffalo as dangerous quarry. Unless those British adventurers were somehow biased, we must conclude that empirically the African buffalo is more dangerous to antagonize than other bovines.That said, I think there are plenty of animals suited for domestication in Africa starting w the myriad of different antelopes, which are related to cattle. And I think it is due to neolithic HBD that they weren‚Äôt, probably b/c there was so much game around that it was easier to hunt than to domesticate.

                            I was about to object and reference 10,000 year expllosion and some of gregory cochrans articles, but you steered in the right direction there at the end.  It seems cold winters may have lead to the discovery of farming, domestication of animals, and even the gene for digesting milk, all of which controllled for higher intelligence and altruism, aka, the domestication of europeans.  I read somewhere that besides a few aging birds, colorful eyes only exist in european descended humans and their domesticated animals.  Coincidence.?

                                I don‚Äôt know about the color of eyes but I suspect that you wanted to object b/c it sounded Jared Diamond-like. And while I DO believe in the specific case of bovines than the African buffalo is more dangerous than aurochs or bison, based on what serious hunters say, the only control case I can think of is the Asian water buffalo. India has two giant bovines in the jungles, the gaur and the water buffalo. The wild water buffalo is far more feared than the gaur. But the water buffalo has also been domesticated. So maybe you COULD domesticate the African buffalo. But the first couple of generations, before you‚Äôve bred out the angry streak, are not gonna be fun to handle, or maybe too much fun, depending on how much action you want lol

            One thing I‚Äôve been thinking through a lot lately are the dysgenic implications of permanent caloric surplus. Our emergent behaviors track pretty closely to the emergent behaviors in Calhoun‚Äôs ‚Äúrat utopia,‚Äù which, though it was supposed to be about overcrowding, actually showed what happens when permanent caloric surplus sends all survival instincts haywire. Unless you‚Äôre a bodybuilder or distance runner, you‚Äôre carrying far more fat than the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù homo sap body is designed to handle (I speak as a fat guy). That has all kinds of interesting biochemical effects‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôve been in that state for a couple generations now, a truly unprecedented state in all of natural history.

                Could very well be that caloric surplus is a situation that trips up our survival instincts. Anonymous Conservative argues that humans can transform from a K strategy suited for scarce resources (hierarchy, distinct male and female roles, competitive, strong distinction between in-group and out-group, aggressive territoriality) to an r strategy, suited for an environment where food is not a limiting resource and which is largely the opposite. He thinks ppl who instinctively favor a K strategy are ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô or ‚Äòright wing‚Äô and ppl who want an r strategy are leftists. I find the idea intriguing.

                Oh stop worrying about caloric surplus.  That can easily be reversed by this one neat trick;$Dollar+Price Discovery=HUNGERYou see the American food distribution system- not food itself but the distribution system requires money to function, or it collapses.  With it goes ‚Äòcaloric surplus.‚Äô  Its also the next big repressive step, and so obvious. Hunger is classic repression, ask the Irish, Ukrainians, Ethiopians, the oldest Germans perhaps too.BTW $+Price Discovery=gasoline distribution breakdown as well.  And without the trucks ain‚Äôt shit on the shelves either.So you can stop ninnying about surplus calories and start worrying about 2500 a day.Our Western White asses ain‚Äôt making it far on 1500 , as the Chinese discovered with our POWs in Korea.US prison system does same, the noggers are less nogging if just a bit hungry.

                    I think you‚Äôre missing the point, that caloric surplus for the last 100 yrs has dulled healthy tribal instincts. That seems quite plausible. That food distribution may break down in the future and that that may have some interesting effects on society, is true but a different issue.

                        I actually agree partially, only partially.  I just don‚Äôt think its a particularly useful tack to take.What can be done?Nothing.Will it continue?No.  I think even if history is not obeyed ‚Äì I mean history‚Äôs lessons and methods of repression for elites, not Marxist History ‚Äì I think hunger happens because our finances are insane, and = hunger.Hunger putting it mildly will be a shock to Americans more than most.   It hasn‚Äôt really happened since the 17th century.  Isolated examples such as The Donner Party ‚Äì good 19th C. SJWs that they were ‚Äì are not encouraging.Since Severian is going on and on about this including at his blog, and he wants to worry overmuch try Severian to picture a America of widespread urban and white collarcannibalism~ Severian I believe you mentioned you wanted to lose some weight?As for me I am not worried ~ both sides of my all Irish family came over years after the famine.Which meansthey fed.No worries here!

                Yes, life form dynamics a very complex puzzle, and there are significant modal differences between ocean-based and land-based species‚Äô dynamics. More significantly yet, for about a billion years, natural forces dominated evolutionary development. It ‚Äòs only in the last few millennia (or even perhaps the last few generations) that artificial (man-made) evolutionary forces have come to dominate our path forward. Personally, I think we are now in a race between a natural colony collapse event and artificial DNA manipulation into an entirely novel neo-species.

                Severian, I have been following your blogs for a while, and your rat utopia/permanent caloric surplus discussions caused me to think through the situations of all my known high school/college peers, as to their marriage and children status.  Dozens of well-off white people, few marriages, almost no children.  Less than 50% ever married, and perhaps 15% to 20% ever started a family.  I don‚Äôt count post-college peers, because my own experience as married and a parent dictated almost all of those relationships.  Question to the commentariat, is my tally one that you see as well?

                I can remember reading one of¬†the Taubes or Luestig books on diet¬†and food where one¬†of them made the point¬†that fat tissue is self-perpetuating.
Apparently fat tissue releases hormones that encourage a person to feel hungry and eat to fill¬†the hunger.
The more fat tissue, the more hormones and¬†the stronger the sense¬†of hunger.
Rinse and repeat.

        I question how well Jews were policing their own ranks 100 years ago.  The ADL was formed about a hundred years ago and it was explicitly anti-white.  It was basically formed to defend a Jew (Leo Frank)who raped and murdered a white child and then tried to pin it on a black and blamed antisemitism for his being blamed.The Leo Frank story is a pretty good example of why we live in our countries and why we should.  This guy was probably just a pervert weirdo. But because he was an ethnic minority, his fellows saw his being blamed as just unreasonable antisemitism and the majority saw it as an outsider murdering one of their own children and using their (outsider) money and power to get away with it.  Because of this one incident a hundred years ago, we are stuck with the modern ADL.

            Yeeks. I‚Äôve got a twitter thread somewhere about millenia of ritual child sacrifices, with a number of both biblical quotes and historical examples. Mary Phagan may have been such a ritual murder, like Indian Thuggees, thus the conspiracy to coverup.




(And, the promotion of abortion products as an industry. Kosher and halal slaughter too.)










This is something hidden in their culture that has been fought over for a very long time, since their beginning.

The fight against it may have been an emergent movement. Thus, the existential battle against the Christ as the final sacrifice.  No more feeding.

                Not hatred.

Pity. Pity for them all.


We areresistant,they are vulnerable.

Not their fault, not anybody‚Äôs fault, not even the blind Creator.


(We are the palliative, the best the universe can do with the materials at hand.)


We have the largest numbers who are born with natural resistance- due to our cold, slightly weird mechanical, frontal cortex brains. K-theory reinforces such a trait.


The hot passions, the throbbing social focus of the insula dominant breeder-brains: they are more vulnerable, more susceptible.


And our caloric, hygenic, and medical success has caused the explosion of the vulnerabler.

        I used to think these past periods of behavior were really fascinating.  People actually ran up the prices of tulip bulbs, at least some rare varieties to the price of a fine home.Our so-called leaders look at these old events and feel smug and superior, completely blind to their own madness. They have even gone as far as developing entire academic schools of thought designed to encourage mass delusion.  It never even occurs to them that maybe the version of themselves 10 years ago who did not think a man in a dress was self-evidently a woman might have a point.

An Englishman and a Belgian can both look up to King Leopold II, a Belgian and an African can‚Äôt. Or a Dutchman and a Black celebrating black face Santa in the Netherlands.

            Partially correct. However mixing White cultures is little better, Englishmen naturally  have little affinity for Leopold II, though certainly more than an African who may have a legitimate beef with stuff he did as ruler.The desire to rule over people who are not our own from birth is poison. I get the urge, it makes one richer and more powerful but it never a good idea.English Kings for English Men is the best way to go.

If you really want to play to win this battle, then the fatal shiv is a new Trump political party that will actually rally all the diehard MAGA fanatics to a third party. Ross Perot proved that this is no trivial option. Not only would that crater many incumbent GOP dinosaurs, but more than a few new MAGA reps would likely win Congressional races. People are pissed and asking them to retreat to the sidelines is lame. But give them a noble cause and some hope, and now you‚Äôre talking real grassroots rebellion.

                Trump leading and funding a Third Party challenge to the Uniparty would be deadly to the DC ruling class. Populism would explode because a Biden Administration will double-down on COVID restrictions, killing off almost all small businesses (think how popular that will be) and a rebirth of Obamacare will doom healthcare services just as the Boomers start to breakdown and really need it. But best of all, Biden will throw open the borders and outsiders will flood in by the tens of millions. The muddle-through believers will be the last to see doom in oncoming freight train. And Nero and his fiddle couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to what‚Äôs coming. But frankly, it‚Äôs long overdue.

                        The road to redemption does not run through the Republican Party. Only a grassroots rebellion by honest-to-God real and patriotic Americans can save us from the cancer of tyranny that infests all of DC. Rooting for the Republicans to have a Come-To-Jesus reincarnation is a fools errand and only delays the inevitable crash and rebirth.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶they are going to have to fear us a little‚Ä¶‚ÄùI keep wondering how far they can push people around before people just get mad.  These people are incredibly vulnerable.  White people had all the money, power and guns in Haiti. Every last white person was either murdered or driven off of the island.  Illiterate African slaves did this.The elite, by definition are a tiny minority.  Our elite is way too big, but it is still maybe a couple percentage points. Their money and power can protect them from a lot, but not an angry determined population motivated to exact revenge on them.  Just like how once in a while ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù has to remind the cops that compliance is voluntary, the so-called elite has completely forgotten just how vulnerable they are and may possibly need a reminder.  Brexit and then Trump 4 months later should have been the kick in the ass they needed. Instead, they took those events as reasons to double down on repression.  Now they have completely delegitimized their own power by screaming Russian interference for 4 years and then cheating in the election in such a blatant and apparently obvious way. We now have 2 elections in a row where the ‚Äúlosing‚Äù side thinks the loss is not legitimate.

            &gt;&gt;White people had all the money, power and guns in Haiti. Every last white person was either murdered or driven off of the island. Illiterate African slaves did this.None of these statements are very accurate. Haiti had a substantial free mulatto population who were referred to as ‚Äúcolored‚Äù rather than ‚Äúblack‚Äù and who owned and operated their own slave plantations. The distinction between ‚Äúcolored‚Äù and ‚Äúblack‚Äù still survives in the Caribbean. The colored population vied with the white population for power in the colony.The black slaves who revolted got quite lucky and fell into a large pile of guns and ammo, so they wound up being quite well armed. Without these weapons the revolt would have been crushed. They also benefited from the fact that French soldiers died like flies from the Yellow Fever.And they did not kill all the whites. They killed all the French, but spared the Polish immigrants and the few English immigrants on the island.Mike Duncan did a series on the Haitian Revolution in his Revolutions podcast. It‚Äôs definitely worth a listen. As the Zman noted, Duncan is a lefty and his bias comes through loud and clear in his treatment of this bit of history, but it‚Äôs informative nonetheless.The Haitian Declaration of Independence is worth reading if you‚Äôre up for a good laugh. At the end of the day the Haitian revolution was little more than a successful slave revolt that led to a long history of governance by a series of competing warlords. This seems to have been lost on Duncan.

                Hmm, I read a book called ‚ÄúWhere Black Rules White,‚Äù which is either late 19th century or early 20th, basically before PC ran amok. It shows at length how dysfunctional Haiti became. I don‚Äôt recall whether I got information about the revolution in that book or somewhere else, but I am wanting to say it was somewhere else, so I might have some of the details wrong. (I pulled up that series. Thanks for recommending it)Still, I think it does illustrate that without voluntary compliance with social norms and laws, the police are very quickly overwhelmed. We see it every single time in riots and even mass shootings. Cops will literally sit outside of a school while our children are gunned down. Some of that is cowardice, but it also illustrates voluntary compliance. A tiny minority of the population could very quickly overwhelm police and they are the last line of defense for the so-called elite.I think we are still a long way from this kind of resistance, but I think we are closer than we were 5 years ago, and not just because linear time. Having had a large military for a long time, there are millions of well trained men in the civilian ranks. The thing they lack is the will to do it. Too many of these men are going down the track of despair and succumbing to drugs and suicide. But sooner or later the despair will turn to anger and hatred. They will realize the things that caused them despair did not just happen, but was done to them.

            No one could accuse the Nazi leadership of being smart. Indeed it was their inexhaustable supply of potent stupidity that led to their utter defeat from the most favorable position in 1938. Most of the Nazi leadership was on a par with anti-Fa. Child molesters, homosexuals, deviants, weirdos, mystics, and worse.The officer corps until the takeover was devoid of Nazis who were considered weirdo street brawlers. Until the takeover there were no Nazi professors, no doctors, no lawyers, no normal middle or upper class people. Afterwards yes ambitious people like Oscar Schindler joined the party for business advancement. But that was it ‚Äî the top leadership remained filled with utter deviants, the most deviant and weird (a tightly closeted homosexual) the man at the top.

        The levels of violence and lack of impulse control might be an indication that regressive DNA is being activated.  Perhaps a set of survival skills that would prove beneficial is the positive to that negative.  Just when you think life isn‚Äôt an adventure anymore, it is.

            The Zman has pointed out how hanging the bad seeds gave us nice, useful betas a chance to have the kids instead and build an Industrial Revolution.




Now, prosperity has allowed sociopathy to breed again, since it was a mate-gathering strategy in the first place.




Look at Mexico. No death penalty, so they end up ruled by Cartel broods.



Tainter‚Äôs complexity theory needs to include mating biology. Ruthlessness is the oldest way to reach the top of the tree and get the largest harem.

May the trees bend under their weight!

        I know that giving nick a chance, and assuming he‚Äôs going to act like a 20 year old and not holding that against him makes sense. This thing isn‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be treated like hobby ( done once in awhile or on the weekends, or for a half hour every morning) we have to live it. And that‚Äôs going to require young blood. And every thing that comes with that. I just hope he doesn‚Äôt hang around with Alex Jones and his silver bullet snake oils to much. When I see that guy, I tune out.

        Great podcast. I will say that liberal people of a certain background are reading the tea leaves which since the 1990s at least have been pointing towards a comprehensive solution of the Deplorable problem. So they are just getting on top of the wave hoping to surf it and avoid wipeout.I do agree with the emergent behavior, and the need to make elites fear us, but disagree that the emerging behavior is not predictable. I think Nietzche‚Äôs approach, of assigning the worst possible motive one can think of for behavior then assuming an even worse one upon consideration is correct.The Puritans hung witches, but they did not just hang any random woman around. They hung mostly old, cranky women with few influential relatives to exact revenge ‚Äî so that the rich and powerful would not have to cough up money or resources to share in their care. The way Cuomo sent the beer infected to nursing homes. ‚ÄúWho will rid me of this meddlesome priest?‚ÄùOf course, the hung did have some relatives. Who ended up siding with enemy Indians and led such Indians in the Metacomet war to various enemies, to great effect. And the trials abruptly stopped once the wife of the Governor of the Colony was accused.It is therefore vital for the DR to get involved with BLM. I am not being facetious. We need to point people like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib who are pushing a bill to free (only) black prisoners and make blacks exempt from jail/prison. We need Omar making bills to seize Apple, Microsoft, Nike, Wal-Mart etc. and make all black people owners, managers, etc. We need Tlaib to push to replace Tim Cook and Sundar Pinchai with Jacob Blake Sr. and one of George Floyd‚Äôs baby mamas. This is how the elites fear us, and it has the effect of forcing elites to either give up their power/position (yeah right) or de-blackify the nation.

        Did anyone listen to Trump on the Maria Bartolomeo show this morning?  I did and I was very disappointed in Trump.  This was his big opportunity to lay out his case, tell us where things are going, etc., but, instead, he was woefully short on any details and just repeated himself alot.Maria tried to get the analysis going by using a state-by-state approach, but Trump went off on his own train of thought, which was short on details and anything that we could hope to hang our hats on.  Probably millions of people watching and he just seems completely unprepared to defend his own case ‚Ä¶ very sad.

        Here‚Äôs a white-pilled contrast to Whiskey‚Äôs last post, an affadavit that was posted on a thread over at ZeroHedge:
http://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18693929/1/15/king-v-whitmer/
This is supposedly one of dozens, possibly similar filings.
If true, there are clear, documented signs that foreign powers were involved in and interfered with our federal elections. Those signs point to powers including Iran and China.
Also, if this filing and its brethren are true, it points to military intelligence as Trump‚Äôs best and most powerful ally in battling the Swamp.

        I would like to add that Trump was a predictable disaster. He made lefty furious and hungry for vengeance but did nothing to stop them. It was like taunting a pit bull behind a rickety fence.Trump will almost certainly die in prison after a show trial. And indeed there will be show trials and imprisonment for nearly all Trump voters. Tlaib and Omar are pushing a bill to abolish prison (but only for blacks) and its a likely slam dunk. After the Dems fake their way to power in Georgia, by stealing the election, its a packed court, gun confiscation, and prison and/or camps for pretty much most every average White guy. Someone like Spencer can avoid that by fleeing to Belize or something, he‚Äôs got money being rich. The rest of us not so much.The rich and powerful have decided to dispose of us. China seems to have purchased the military leadership and so has won without firing a shot ‚Äî expect the military leadership to actively help in its disbanding under Biden/Harris.A smart DR would start circulating a modern day Zimmerman Telegram. China‚Äôs orders to the Pentagon brass to disband the military and send all the White officers and non-coms ESPECIALLY Special Forces to ‚Äúre-education camps‚Äù modeled after theirs for the Uighurs.

        Such dishonest coverage of Groypers. They don‚Äôt claim to be right wing and fight with the left? YOU don‚Äôt like TRS for some reason. It seems to me that something personal happened behind the scenes and you are holding a grudge.

Explain how the Groyper strategy of trying to infiltrate the GOP is going to work when you yourself have admitted that that strategy won‚Äôt work? These people are a year away from being TPUSA.

            Not a fan of Fuentes personally. He seems like a little weiner who likes hanging out with sexual weirdos. The fact that he is able to stay on Youtube makes me suspicious that he might be controlled opposition. That being said, his people are essentially on our said, and the feuding between him and the TRS guys is silly. But this is something that is a two way street, and his group of freaks and irony bros are just as responsible for this feud as the TRS side. The thing that makes me lean towards the TRS side is they actually are trying to make a community and hook op with people of the opposite sex. But I am willing to admit have have no idea which side is better. It would be nice if this wasn‚Äôt a choice.

            I would imagine Z man correctly recognizes the TRS crew as a cult.  There can be no disagreement with the cult‚Äôs positions.  None will be tolerated.  Their positions (or their ‚Äútake or the ‚Äúshot‚Äù as they refer to their opinions/facts) can also change dramatically.  At one time, Trump was the ‚ÄúGod emperor‚Äù.  Now he is absolute scum and deserves to be jailed, or worse.

                Agreed. I was a paywall subscriber until they started deleting any comments I made that didn‚Äôt fit their narrative but not in a cartoonish way that could be pointed and laughed at. When they deleted a comment about The White Hot Takes (saying it would be nice if they put out more content again), I walked away. By that time, Marcus Halberstram, Lauritz con Guildhausen, Larry Ridgeway, etc. had left so that decision was an easy one to make.

                The content on TRS is bad:TDS ‚Äì No real attempts to be funny, the slap fighting between Sven and Mike is tiring. They‚Äôre more or less stuck with each other and that‚Äôs likely why they haven‚Äôt split.FTN ‚Äì Rarely covers the news, focuses their attention on how everyone and everything is controlled by the chosenites. Jazzhands is extremely arrogant, outright saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll tell you what to think‚Äù even though they lost serious credibility getting COVID wrong and never bothering to own up to it.Strike and Mike ‚Äì Two Duginist/Strasserists rambling for three hours about Jews.The Third Rail ‚Äì Revolving door of hosts, getting worse and worse each time. When it was Borzoi, Spectre, and Lauritz, it was a great underrated show. Now it‚Äôs entirely forgettable.The Paranormies were never good.

                    FTN is undoubtedly the worst.  The arrogance is off the charts.  Never seen anything quite like it.  Third Rail used to be good with Borzoi.  TDS remains somewhat listenable, due to Mike‚Äôs ‚Äúgift of gab‚Äù.  Otherwise, they are all very angry, hate their audience and probably hate that they can do nothing in life but do more and more nihilistic podcasts.I predict they will do either a mass shooting or group suicide.  Or perhaps COVID will take them all out as predicted on FTN for several months.
