        I was oil field trash until I got out on my own after college. All my relatives were oil field workers. I know from experience that it has always been a cyclical business. Boom and bust, forever.
I’m still oil field trash, of course. It ain’t gonna be washed out, and besides, I’m kinda proud of it.

        Which is why I have no time to be re-re-explained to about solar/hydro/bio/geo/wind “energy” hobbies until there are 12 new Nuke plants actually on line, and Yucca Mountain holds their open house.And yes, I DO have the old coal burning furnace in place, (not worth removing for the oil/steam system that NOW heats water during heating season) as a matter of fact. 6′ of duct work and it’s good to go.

        The Fed stepped in to prop up the asset markets, but there’s not much they can do about wholesale prices. That’s where energy costs show up. But, that just gives them an excuse to keep the money spigot open.As far as the Saudis, they probably accept the fact it will take years to get everyone back in-line as far as production. They can live with $30 oil more than they can live with a nuclear Iran. Plus, they are looking to diversify into natural gas. They want that Qatar-Turkey pipeline to run through the Arabian peninsula. That gives them a big chunk of the European market. it also make Europe the guarantor of the regime’s health.The great game is afoot. WW3 comes if Israel decides they have to strike Iran. The only reason they would strike Iran is if the Russians give them the bomb. The Russians are now at war on two fronts, banking and energy. Everyone is betting they blink before it gets too hot.

        Could this be the beginning of the dreaded “deflation” of all commodity prices? Perhaps an overdue correction of the ratio between long stagnate wages and ever rising prices?
I live in Delaware, Z-man, please, please don’t give Joe Biden any bright ideas. Many here wish he would run away, take his crooked sons with him, and never come back.

        This has all happened before. OPEC fixes, literally, high prices, producers explore and drill, the Saudis–the largest and cheapest cost producer–flood the market (in this case they need only to not cut back) to collapse the new producers. The effect will not be so lasting and widespread this time because the world, especially going forward, needs far more oil than OPEC can deal with.
Those investors who need $70 to break even deserve to  be separated from their money. That goes for government owned producers, and most of them which are not in America are government owned.

        A question I have is- is there a way we can tell the Saudis to go pound sand? I realize that oil is a global market and all but… I hate the idea of those guys being rich. If the North Americans were to develop all our resource could we cut the sheiks out?

        No one can really pinpoint an explanation for why oil fell so much,  but the factors that were in place to make oil go up so much are still in place so this decline in price will likely be temporary. Unless it stays at $50-60 for years at a time, it is hard to assess the economic effects.

        The GDP boost is probably not as big as hoped, but there’s a reason every post-WW2 recession has been preceded by a spike in energy costs. Of course, an interesting side effect will be a boost to the candidacy of Joe Biden. A suddenly booming economy in 2015 means Biden gets a bump from the suddenly popular Obama.

        Yes there are losses to be suffered by the low cost oil situation but there are great multiplier gains to be reaped.  Every dollar not spent by consumers for “oil” is freed up to rove elsewhere.  Increased travel, additional purchases of hard goods, etc., yield benefits to those outside the energy complex. Capitalism has its risks for those in the energy business as well as those without.  I love the dance.
