        I don’t know, Z. I am uncomfortably worried that the Dems and the Harris-types could succeed indefinitely. None of it makes sense any more. Rationally, you look at this and say “Reality has to intercede at some point” but it doesn’t. When the national debt went from $5 trillion to $15 trillion within only a few years I thought the end was near. Now it’s $35 trillion. I thought the “market” was due to crash when the Dow hit 14,000. It did – and then they reinflated the bubble and now it’s 41,000. I thought it was insane when you couldn’t touch a house for less that $100,000 or buy a car for less than $20k. I thought it was over when we had let only 10 million illegals in instead of 30 million.You would think that the GAE would have learned a lesson when it got defeated in Vietnam — 51 years ago. Didn’t stop them from a failed 20-year war in Afghanistan that cost trillions.Unfortunately I think it is possible that fifty or 100 years from now we could be looking back on an unbroken string of Harris-types as president. The Democrat party will never nominate a straight white man ever again. The demographics are in favor for people like her for the foreseeable future.Look at the British. You would think that the Somme in 1916 should have signaled the end, but a century later they’re still a global power and an economic power. Yes, they are incredibly debased from a century ago, and they have lost their empire, but they are a nuclear power that still sends troops to police Third World nations like Afghanistan.Liz Truss may hardly be a Winston Churchill — but look how bad Churchill fucked up a century ago.Enoch Powell gave his famous speech in what –1968? He was right. Nobody gave a damn.So yeah, it SHOULD all get flushed… but that doesn’t mean it WILL unless there is some kind of Black Swan.

            I agree. People talk and talk and talk about collapse and nothing seems to happen. I been holding boxes of ammo for years thinking the dead where gonna start walking the streets any day…. and they have in the big cities mostly but it all keeps chugging along regardless. Even though I feel like I’m the only person I know who has to go to work the system keeps going.Instead we focus on some lady due to be installed as president who supposedly drinks. Part of me wants to get this party started but it may be better if my children were a little older. (Me being one of the few that actually had children.)Our world may still be dominated and catering to boomers and thus the image we have of collapse is intrinsically boomerish and thus predicated to massively impactful; like their lavish motorcycles and lake houses. Instead it may be just a whimper.Just my ramblings for the morn.

                “Our world may still be dominated and catering to boomers and thus the image we have of collapse is intrinsically boomerish and thus predicated to massively impactful; like their lavish motorcycles and lake houses. Instead it may be just a whimper.”Generally, yes. We want the slow cancer because then most of us will somehow stumble through the rest of our lives. The Roman empire was that. Lots of people could see the rot, but it’s hard to mark a day that was the “official” end. Not even the sacking of Rome can be thought of that, as life continued on in very Roman fashion immediately after.Part of me can’t wait to at least see the other side of a Boomer side, in small hope that we have at least a different discussion than we’ve had for the last several decades.

            I think it was Adam Smith who said “there is much ruin in a Nation”. We haven’t reached binding constraints yet on any of our many follies. You pointed out the British as a good example. It was 200 years from the Roman humiliation to the Persians until the fall of Rome. History suggests we could all be bitching about this same stuff on Zman’s website indefinitely, or at least until it gets shut down.

                It was less than a hundred years until final collapse after the battle of Adrianople and effective open borders for the Gothic tribes from the East to North Africa with Rome sacked multiple times.

            The British analogy may be a poor one. UK “success” of the last 80 years is, to a great extent, a result of having a greater hegemon to lean on. I’m unaware who will fill that role for the GAE in its decline.

                Yes, agreed. The US is a superpower era is about the extension of the UK one. It’s really more of a seamless transition to a younger relative than a change.

            Consider that just 20 years ago America was considered the sole superpower at the end of history.  Our own lifetimes are brief, but in the historical perspective, hardly ever has a greater empire squandered its power and legitimacy more swiftly and completely.

                This is the truth, and it will speed up exponentially soon. Those born in the 1980s and 1990s will not have a comfortable old age. It’s not one thing. It’s all of them.

        If only someone could put Kamala’s “Joy” in a bottle and sell it.
(Oh wait, they did. It’s called “alcohol”.)
Seriously. How come some entrepreneur isn’t selling a wine bottle/beer can/vodka in a plastic jug called “Joy” with Kamala’s face on it?
Trump should do this and charge a fortune for it.

            PS.  Read Annie Jacobsen’s “Nuclear War-A Scenario” over the weekend.  Have not slept that badly since reading “The Road” in a single sitting.  But if you want to get your heebie-jeebies on, imagine the current or proposed Dem clown in that scenario. In Derbyshire’s words “We’re doomed”

                Good book.  Highly recommend.
My takeaway?  Given the 10 minute window for launch/no launch, the President probably won’t be making the decision anyway.
Not to worry:  Daniel Ellsberg’s book “The Doomsday Machine – Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner” talks about how many dozens, if not hundreds of service personnel can launch nukes independently.   Makes total sense given the “decapitation strike” scenario.
I’m not worried about the Puppet in the White House launching.  The “one man with a finger on the button” has been a Hollywood fiction since the first atom bomb dropped.

                    My biggest worry is these morons get us into the position where it becomes necessary.  Like the scenario posited where Putin refuses to talk to anybody in the command structure except the now-unavailable President. Even the Allies kept wraps on their Nuremberg aspirations until after the war concluded.  Sheer idiocy.

                    Don’t fall for, or spread, the FUD.  There is no 10 minute window.  That’s what sells books, but is not US policy.  Unless someone can point me to published official change In US nuclear deterrence policy, my understanding is that our nuke capabilities are designed to receive and survive a first strike.  It has been so since SAC and the 60’s.Land, sea, and air are the three legs of our deterrence.  As I’ve posted, we have 12-14 (depending whom you talk to) Ohio class sub’s potentially on patrol as a nuke deterrence force.  UK runs a couple more themselves.  Each sub carries 20 Trident II missiles with up to 8 MIRV’s.  Treaty limits them currently to 4-5 MIRV’s, details start getting fuzzy due to secrecy.  Even 4 times 20 is….80.  If those nukes are of our max power, about 15 M-tons, then just one surviving sub arguably wipes out all of Russia.Stop the FUD.  Use your critical thinking skills and do some research.  No one wants a nuke war, which is why we designed things so that one—if it does happen—is not survivable by either party, or for that matter *all* parties involved (we’ve got plenty for China as well).

                        After reading a couple of books on nukes, I don’t worry about it AT ALL.
May as well live in fear of an asteroid strike.

Her next book will be called “How to Get Back at Whitey” (or something like that)  which everyone around here will rightly reject.  But because we’ve been subjected to 70 years of propaganda on the subject, everyone just assumes it’s a reminder of how close we are to dying.  If only people like her were running things, we’d be living in utopia.

                I’ve not read the book, but I have seen her on appearances a few times and have looked at reviews by people who know about the topic.She makes all kinds of ridiculous assumptions, like that everyone involved is a robot incapable of thinking and oblivious to the consequences of a large nuclear exchange.She also just assumes that the whole worst case models of nuclear winter are not only accurate, but probably underestimating the effect.Keep in mind that she is a journalist and by definition, not trustworthy. She is not a neutral finder and teller of fact, she is an advocate and a saleswoman.Does she mention the “Samson Option” in the book?The Road was an excellent book and the movie adaption was great too, though there were things that puzzled me.  Like when they found that underground fallout shelter, why they didn’t stay there for a long time and get back to health.

                    The cataclysmic nuclear war scenario also works from the 1980s assumption that all the nukes from the 80s still work.  This has come up before and I guess nukes on boomer subs are more reliable, though it should be noted the Brits failed, twice, in a somewhat recent missile test from one of their subs.
Put another way, a lot of these nightmare scenarios are based around the   idea of incompetent people in charge of competent systems, which is not how it works.

                        Of course, working nukes or inservice nukes is a secret.  But we used to have 15k of these things when Bush the lessor took office.  Obama signed a $1T bill to modernize and upgrade our nuke’s.  I suspect we have a few thousand at least in very good condition.  In any event, the first nuke designs were fairly crude and I assume could be made again without all the bells and whistles from the tons and tons of plutonium we have stored.
Nukes are never gonna be unavailable.

                            The point is that nukes sitting in the ground have shelf life without maintenance. Yes, there could be a time when nukes will be unavailable, ideally to all of the world though.

                    Well, that requires me to simultaneously believe our military commanders are ethical geniuses despite almost all evidence to the contrary.  Worse, in my student days did a bit of RA work for my thesis adviser which included hand indexing a dozen hour transcript of his interview with Curtis LeMay.

                        You don’t need to be an “ethical genius” in order to not act like a robot following a program.One of her scenarios I heard her speak about was North Korea launching a single nuke requiring a full launch of all our strategic land based nukes on a use them or lose them game theory basis.The whole nuclear war by accident due to the “use them or lose them” mentality is retarded. Both sides have had these situations come up (falsely) and nobody panicked and launched them. This is why we have a “nuclear triad.” Each sub has 24 Trident MERV (multiple re-entry warheads) missiles. (Wikipedia: There are927warheads deployed on 210 Trident II D5 missiles, or an average of 4.4 warheads per missile.) The carriers are likely have nukes too, though they will neither confirm nor deny. There are hundreds if not thousands ready to be launched from the air as well.Would the world have been better off if they couldn’t have made the weapons? Like just physics blocked them? Yes.(well, possibly) But now that they exist and can easily be built by advanced technological societies, we need them to deter others from using them against us. The genie cannot be put back into the bottle. We are stuck with them. As awful as our leaders are, they probably don’t want to die in a nuclear Armageddon.

                            Your specific point wrt the numbers of nukes is precisely to prevent a use them or lose them scenario.  Simply having retaliatory capability buys time to assess the most appropriate response if a nuke or nukes goes off, or a full scale nuke war seems imminent.For example, a SUV equipped with optional nuke capability (2025 models only) drives up to Washington and takes out the government.  So what?  We have plenty of them ourselves once we know whom to gift them to.  😉  My understanding is that we would know who, because of radiological signatures.  Of course this takes time, so did the response after 9/11.  Lot’s of nukes with delivery ability buys us that time.

                        I don’t think he had radiation sickness. It was years of exposure to cold and malnutrition. At least that is what is implied.Also, for the record, radiation sickness DOES go away and you do recover from it and get back to health. If you don’t die from the acute symptoms, you live. If you get a radiation dose large enough to kill you, you die from the symptoms, not from the radiation. This is why they treat people with severe acute radiation sickness. If you can get them through the acute symptoms, they will live and be normal again. The only difference between someone who has survived acute radiation sickness and some who hasn’t is a statistically higher likelihood of cancer later in life. Many, many Japs had pretty severe radiation sickness, but they pulled through and went on to live long productive lives.If you want to be amazed, look up the story of Hisashi Ouchi. He was exposed to very high levels of radiation at his job. He did die, but they tried for a long time to get him past the radiation sickness.

                    Nope, you’re correct. Those were “halcyon” days compared to now. We had a president who committed “adultery” in his heart and apologized to his *wife* for such on camera.
Today we have a presidential candidate that represents what is known as a “new” woman—who proudly f**ked her way to the top of the political hierarchy.  She was previously known to Californians as Willie Brown’s mattress. (Typo intended!)

                        It’s easy to mock Harris as a whore and you’re not wrong, but her voters don’t care. The tattooed bisexual university girls who are on their way to a Slutwalk or a “Pussy Hat march” against Trump after attending the “Vagina Monologues” are not going to vote Trump because Harris sucked off Willie Brown in 1994. Harris being a whore is probably seen as a positive trait, not a negative one.Just saw a news story about how Harris’s Jew husband banged his kid’s teacher and she had an abortion while he was married to his first wife.It’s not as if these people have any shame.And it’s not as if our guy isn’t a manwhore and a womanizer himself.Compared to these people Trump looks like a prude, but that’s not saying much…

            Not beer, wine, or vodka, but cheap ass whiskey. After all, it matches Kamala’s skin color. Then there’s the bottle. I wouldn’t go with a plastic jug but aKamala-shapedglass bottle like the Aunt Jemima ones. Money can be saved on the ads too. Don’t make a new ad, just show clips of K-ho stumbling around and slurring her words to the tune of “Entrance of the Gladiators” (the famous clown music we’ve all heard) and then the text appears “After a few belts of this you won’t care about the election!”.

            In probably 2004 or 2005 enjoying solo travels in Mexico: Among gifts I sought a bottle of better-quality Tequila for a friend who still drank. While visiting the various liquor vendors at the city markets, I noted with some trepidation some of the local rotgut, probably pulque. It was sold in gallon glass bottles with a pasted on white paper label, looked like what industrial chemicals would have been packaged here in the 1960s, perhaps. The look reminded me of paint thinner. I didn’t sample the product obvs but I suspect it wasn’t much different! If transport hadn’t been an issue, I would have bought a bottle just for the novelty value. Even had I still been a drunk I don’t think I would’ve been brave enough to sample it, however.And that bottle of luxe tequila? Well, I schlepped it home in my backpack, 2000 miles or so of bus travel. Chuck liked it. He worked in a high-end restaurant, and said you could buy exactly the same stuff here in the States for nearly the same price I paid. (Tact was not prominent among Chuck’s traits.)Thus ended my days as an informal liquor importer.

        After seeing the way they stuffed Biden into a box last night to humiliate him (and that was just the beginning), I’m left with a pretty sick feeling in my stomach about what’s coming. I know a lot of you still have a flicker of hope in voting. Well, that was the president last night (whom peopledidvote for, at least in the primaries in 2020) who had a coup pulled on him and his campaign money stolen and given to a black woman with no talent, no brains, and no ability to speak a complete sentence. I mean, I’m picking up a message here. Maybe I’m wrong. I’m open to correction.Edit: And make no mistake. We’ve got a hard 30% of this country that will accept this, maybe more. In some parts of the US, that’s 9.5 people out of 10 around you whose minds will accept anything as long as it’s on a screen. JFC.

        The real gaslighting, the real delusion, is that there is a choice on the ticket that reverses, or even arrests the decline. Few around here may drink that kool aid, but it’s still imbibed AINOwide. And even among those of us who are, or feign to be, so jaded and “black pilled” as to see the futility of it all, there tends to yet linger in some corner of our minds some little hope for a Trump victory, as if that will change something for the better. Trust me, a second Trump term, were it to happen, would be no more accomplished or productive than the first was. And my guess is that it will be even less so, as he has by now transformed, policy wise, into more of a standard Republican than what he claimed to be in 2016 (yet never really was). And that’s putting aside, for the moment, what deranged response from the “left” a second Trump term would inspire.

The most bloodless resolution would be for this to happen. The probability isn’t all that high but such certainly is in the realm of possibility. Otherwise, correct, and I easily could see Trump going right along with everything happening now.

                However likely it is, I continue to rate peaceful separation as more likely than civil war. Primarily because AINO denizens have mostly grown too soft for the latter. Nor do I believe the people running fedguv, or their minions, possess the stomach to violently bring wayward provinces to heel.

                            This is really the problem with the CW 2.0 scenarios. The crazed Karens who put on pussy hats will shriek and scream for blood but to get a civil war going you need strong young men fully committed to the cause on both sides. The Right still has a few of those but the Left would need to farm out the violence to… whom? The hordes of illegals may be the right age and sex but most aren’t that invested in what they see as disagreements between White factions.

                                There’s more liberal white boys in the military than you think. And as far as the “conservative” ones, they follow orders. When I was a professor some of my most “conservative” students were Criminal Justice majors — who all wanted to get paid stupid money working for Blue state police agencies violating people’s constitutional rights. Some of the most “conservative” people I know are corrections officers who get paid good money to keep people in a cage for decades.if their chain of command told them to arrest you for an “illegal” gun or magazine, oh well. “It’s the law.” besides, THEY are exempt….

                There is not going to be enough violence to rise to the level of a civil war. Recall 4 short years ago when everyone masked up and stayed home the moment they were ordered. Those are not people who are going to fight a civil war. When the negros went rampaging that summer, nobody did too much about it. There are not enough civil warriors for there to be a civil war. Nor is there any infrastructure or logistical support to make them so. There could be a degree of unrest. Kind of like 2020.

                    Chances are you’re correct. However, the future is one of the toughest things to predict! And there are scenarios where civil unrest could lead to much more. For instance, hordes of orcs could do the unutterably stupid and decamp to the sticks to massacre a town of white Trump voters. That could be a trip-wire. Or, irony of ironies, California could attempt to secede, and the Grillers, enraged by the possible breakup of Muh ‘Murka, demand and get an armed response.
On the whole, fairly unlikely, I spose, but hardly out of the question.

        I watched the whole thing, as they say. The Democrats have adopted many of the elements of Trump’s successful 2016 platform, such as bringing back industry, infrastructure, manufacturing, good blue collar jobs, and are merging it with their shilling for unions and abortion. It’s disgusting, of course, but Dems shilling for abortion is a given. So that is their message, blue collar jobs + abortion. They have pretty much dropped all the Great Awokening rhetoric that defined them the past decade – the transgender, BLM, diversity is our strength, intersectionality, black girl magic, muh White supremacists, stonewall, etc. – was mentioned in passing or not at all. The GOP talked more about gays and black people on day 1 of their convention than the Dems did in theirs. Of course we have three more days of this, but Dems have a message and are focused on it. It’s true that the issues concerning to voters have not changed much and the Dems rate poorly on these issues, but it’s also true that anyone with a pulse will get 45% of the vote and 200-250 EVs. The Dems are talking about what they are talking about it because it appeals to Whites without college degrees in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. You know – the people who will decide the election. You know what does not appeal to these people? Stapling green cards to diplomas. Or that Jews are not powerful enough anymore and we need to start a total war with Iran. Or the platinum plan. So, we will see, but if the GOP doesn’t see what the Dems are trying to do here, they can’t say they weren’t warned about it.

                There is no doubt. I am under no delusions of what they will do, or what they are doing. Because they are enforcing it now. I am talking about their rhetoric in an election year. If they can convince enough people in those states I mentioned – and it’s not that many people – that they actually care about White people and good jobs, then they will win the election. They know that and that is what they are doing. So Trump needs to respond accordingly.

            I noticed a sign put up by a regime apologist (a poverty pimp) in the neighborhood that said “hate won’t save America” (in a color scheme close to Trump signs no less).  Such tactics are interesting as it admits that the opponent has been forced onto Trump’s court, in this case conceding the fact that America is in need of saving (“okay if it’s not ‘hate’, then what?”, etc.).

                Biden touched upon this in his speech. That America needs help… and they are the ones to help it, not Trump. That they are the party of freedom. And, you know, Trump has made a centerpiece of his campaign his supposedly incredible first term. Okay, fair enough, but they’re tying him to that, saying things like, well, you didn’t get an infrastructure bill passed and we did. Manufacturing left on your watch and its coming back on ours. And, well, the truth of this doesn’t matter (although they DID get the infrastructure bill passed, it’s a horrible bill), it’s rhetoric.Despite hints that they were going to make our sacred democracy a centerpiece of this run, it’s really not. They barely even mentioned muh insurrection, probably because they know it’s run its course and they know they rigged 2020. I know some people will say that this is blackpilling, but it’s more the fact that Trump has work to do and his campaign messaging ain’t cutting it. Dems of course have a huge advantage by scheduling their convention late, having the media behind them, and running a blank slate candidate that never faces scrutiny, but that’s the reality of it. No point in whining.

            “Shilling for abortion”
No, no, NO. They are shilling for f*** who you want, when, where, and how you want, as often as you want, regardless of prior obligations or commitments, and socialize the consequences.
Abortion is simply a corollary.

        Trump better hope the delusion of his inevitable defeat remains intact through September 11, the ironic date on which he is scheduled to be sentenced in New York. Then again, Judge Merchan is a ludicrous buffoon filled with wishful psychosis, too, so it may be foolish to assume he has the ability of second order thinking and how a custodial sentence likely would make Trump more popular. No one should be surprised if Trump is sent to prison that day.As for the “boozy” part, I had discounted Harris’ reputed alcoholism as a typical partisan line of attack, but damned if she doesn’t seem drunk all the time. Her rank idiocy should be the default explanation but upon closer examination she’s certainly three sheets in the wind at least part of the time. Maybe stupidity isn’t as reliable as dementia as a control mechanism for a puppet, so drunkenness has to be thrown into the mix? Dunno.Final thought: the deranged and delusional clowns at that sideshow have control of nuclear weapons and invaded Russian territory recently. People this detached from reality easily could produce mushroom clouds. It is a miracle that hasn’t happened.

            If I was a cognizant human being running for President and realized all the ways I’m controlled and compromised just for a shot at infamy to serve the Devil in Washington, I’d drink too.But I don’t think Kamala is drunk all the time. She’s trying to act breezy and bubbly and doing a poor job at it. She is simply out of her league, in the biggest league on Earth, which would cause me to hit the bottle too. At best she belongs at the head of a civil service department.The Democrats have apparently decided they must meme certain people into leadership, rather than finding the most able politicians. I’m sure the Dems have able politicians, and probably a couple that even us on the d-right would not mind terribly. But no, they memed Sleepy Joe and now they’re meming B-Side Kamala. In a just world, they wouldn’t get away with it twice. But we don’t live in a just world.

I’m convinced Putin’s patience is the only reason Ukraine hasn’t gone nuclear yet.
Sadly for the world, those who will follow Putin are much less patient.

                Agreed, Geese, and meant to tuck that into my comment. It is hard to imagine the restraint that has required, and I’m sure he’s been counseled by his own military to give a rather inconsequential country a taste of canned sunshine. Maybe having been part of the secret police gives him more insight into what is happening here now.

        Beware, sometimes the insanity wins. A comedian famous for playing the piano with his penis on TV has somehow persuaded hundreds of thousands of solid white guys to die needlessly on his behalf in Ukraine. Can this happen here? Will the LEOs and NGs follow the lead of a corrupt pedophile dementia patient and his 4th rate cackling prostitute sidekick into a war against average white guy citizens? Yes, it can happen here, as in the UK presently. Cui bono when white guys kill white guys en masse? Who is then left to go after the parasites after the smoke clears?

                The parties’ media spectacles are equally baffling. Any sane man seeing any Democrat-branded thing wonders, “Can they really not see how ugly and stupid this is?” They cannot, and the few who can, enjoy it. “This is subhuman!” Yes. It knows its audience.The Republican convention—and every media moment of Trump’s campaign since he was dragged off stage with his fist up (not in the script, reality man)—was a celebration of the total defeat of the Republican voter, a gay black Indian victory dance on the viewers’ graves. And everybody clapped.You mentioned Kanye. A fringe bit of the summer psyop was the latestYe update.Sadly the man’s been terribly brain damaged by nitrous oxide abuse and just isn’t himself anymore—so stop thinking about him. Especially don’t remember the time when his minder threatened that if Kanye kept acting like a free man, being a Trump fan, crazily blasting the Jews, etc., they’d take all his money and chemically lobotomize him. Didn’t happen!

        The idea that a mystery meat bimbo could actually be installed as the US figurehead is ridiculous, but that’s where this dumpster fire of a country is now.  And whoever is really running the show isn’t even pretending to want to at least try look make things look serious and that capable individuals are in charge.  I guess when you really think about it, it’s been this way for a pretty long while, but now it’s just a freaking joke.

        The gaslighting is everywhere. Currently on my annual 60 day sojourn to the “island of unreality” and feel more like John Adams at the Court of Versailles than ever in 32 years.  Ran into a family friend who is a Goldman MD, and not a dumb guy, asked his view on the election and impact–he’s usually pretty straight–and the answer was a forced “oh everything will be fine, no problemo…” (I paraphrase) Was weird. But everything feels forced. And yes, have watched numerous peer firms fail in my old industry–and folks I knew at those firms parroted “it’s fine”, yet I was modeling their earnings and knew it wasn’t, but the desire to believe was unshakeable.  That’s where we are right now, until we’re not.  Just focusing on my exit from NY….

                    Interesting. I might add a bit to that. I don’t remember *ever* hearing a flight recorder, or pilot communications to the ground during a (imminent) catastrophic event that wasn’t eerily calm and collected—right to the moment of impact.
I am always amazed at this. Perhaps there is a selection bias going on, but those pilots I’ve heard are damn better people than me.

                        Pilots are trained to “fly it into the crash,” i.e. maintain as much control as you can for as long as you can to minimize what happens on impact. You may survive, you may not. You don’t know until you know, so you never give up.So you are always working. In the famous Sioux City crash, 111 people died, but by not giving up and maintaining a semblance of control they saved 171. Sullenberger never gave up and everyone lived with basically no injuries.In instances where you have a total loss of control such as an airframe break-up or stall in icing conditions you’re f–ked so fast that you almost don’t have enough time to react and “say your prayers,” you’re still trying to figure out exactly WTF happened.Instances in which you know you’re going down and there’s nothing you can do and you have time to think about it are probably pretty rare, the flat-spin of the twin turbo in Brazil a couple of weeks ago was probably one such case.

                            Also, you’re deep in your checklists. When we lost an engine over Baghdad from a MANPADS, we all did our jobs without worrying about the ramifications. The co-pilot read off the relevant checklists and helped me, the aircraft commander, execute them step by step along with providing a second set of eyes. He also read off relevant data so I could keep my eyes on the terrain and the controls. We provided a check to each other. Our loadmaster was our eyes on the ailing engine and the wings, letting us know that everything was working as it should.We were as calm as a Sunday drive to church, but it did help that everyone on that flight had more than 1,000 flight hours on the C-130 and knew our procedures better than anyone in the squadron.

                                The black pilot in the Atlas Air crash had a record of training deficiencies and checkride failures for randomly flipping switches when he didn’t know what he was doing and had been fired from a ton of jobs for incompetence. Apparently in the crash event he made improper control inputs and basically lost his composure on a go-around. There is some indication he was putting in incorrect control inputs that were contradicting the inputs of the white pilot.

                    Perhaps my favorite contemporary writer, certainly essayist, is Lihn Dihn, a Vietnamese refugee who returned there. He was at Unz and now has a Substack. He has written that even after the Americans pulled out and all that had transpired, the summer before Saigon fell most there were carefree and oblivious to what was about to happen to them. Looking at what is happening in Britain now, it seems London has decided that since the white working class does not seem ready to die in the next war, it needs to be eliminated. It is similar here. People should have left the cities already, and even those who have need their passports in order. I have a bad feeling as well.

                        In a true crisis your passport will be of little avail. We live in a time when a U.S. citizen’s privilege (it’s not a right) to leave the country can be suspended just because he might say unflattering things at a conference in Russia.Forbidding crossing a frontier has clear legal validity if someone is, say, wanted for a major crime. But when no laws have been broken, well, that is the stuff of dictatorships, not republics, Recall it wasn’t until but a few years back that U.S. Citizens could visit Canada and Mexico and return without a passport. That’s no longer the case.

            After the crash, I learned that the brother of one of my structured finance rating agency colleagues liquidated his portfolio in late ’07/ early ’08.
Me?  My entire office?  Industry?   Totally flat-footed and unemployed in mid-’08.
The guy asked his brother, “How did you know?”
His response?   “How could you not know?  All I did was listen to what you were saying.”

                    Classical economics says that debt is either repaid as agreed in currency units that (more or less) hold their value, or that the debt is defaulted upon. The two basic choices are outright default, which usually equates with deflation. Old debit and credit entries are simply declared worthless. Cash money gains in value. The last time this happened on a widespread scale was the 1930s Great Depression. The second and (to my understanding) far more common option is to default via inflation of the currency unit. Each dollar becomes worth less until ultimately, worthless.Infinite variations are possible. For example, the maturity could be extended. For example, 30-day Treasury debt might be converted into ten or thirty year bonds. This is, so to speak, a partial default since the debtor has reneged on the agreed upon repayment terms.

Not seeing that hyperinflation is the process of saving debt at all costs, even buying it outright for cash. Deflation is impossible in today’s dollar terms because policy will allow the printing of cash, if necessary, to cover every last bit of debt and dumping it on your front lawn!

                Had a similar experience with a friend that had been in the mortgage brokering business for over 20 years at that point.  Talked to him around Dec ’06 and told me almost every loan sent to warehouse the last 60 days had been some combo of 0-5% equity down payment, interest only/balloons…even he was “WTF?”  I just started discretely liquidating equities to cash.  And thankfully worked for a firm that where are new CEO had inherited a smallish CDS business–run by new hires we all thought were shady. He sussed out their bullshit and started paying the costs to commute the contracts in 2005 so we were clean by 07.  We had cash to start picking off assets from firms like AIG and Hartford…then the Feds stepped in and on those plans…another story

        I tuned in briefly to the DNC because like a traffic accident or the freak show at the circus, you don’t want to look, but you just have to take a peek.What I saw turned my stomach. Non-stop lies. An agenda built on death, disorder and tyranny.And it was dull and lifeless. As limp as that pathetic “singer” James Taylor and his silly performance. Or wannabe southerner and “country” music “star” Jason Isbell, who hates his own people with a passion and serves those who would disenfranchise and destroy them.The speeches were duller than dull. Joe Biden was hopped up on adderall and screeching at crowd, spewing lies as he always does.I found myself glad that the protestors are there and could break through the barriers and liven up the proceedings with a taste of enrichment. But apparently, the security forces held them at bay and my interest waned.I quickly turned the channel. It’s just another stupid episode in the dumbest reality show in the planet, American Politics.

That’s a real concern. The timeline of the GAE’s collapse will not be determined by who is in The Big Puppet Chair unless some stupid and reckless decision is made to go full kamikaze, and an alarming of insane people are well-positioned to do just that.

                    Well you gotta figure that the first woman president is guaranteed to go to war, because she has to prove how “tough” she is. And this comes at a time of Ukraine, Iran/Gaza, and the neocons banging the drum about Taiwan. Personally I’d settle for invading Grenada again, but they seem to have other ideas.

                I wonder if she knows that she isn’t in charge. If not, I wonder if she will demand that she get her way on some policy at some point. And if that happens, what will those who are really in control do to smack her down?
I can imagine that, as President, she is informed that Israel is going to hit Gaza much harder than ever. Since she is brown, she identifies with the Palestinians, and she demands that the USA prevent Israel from doing that. How do those who are really in control bring her to heel?

                    Harris is paid to do what she is told to do. Her earliest political iteration was as a literal whore to a high-profile mayor, and the taxpayers of San Francisco footed the bill for the sidepiece act. The problem will be if two of TBTB diverge on something and she has to decide the tiebreaker (Israel is a good guess), and she’s also an idiot. I actually think there is a chance that TPTB have decided that’s too big of a risk and will go with the bigger and smarter Tel Aviv shill, Trump. I can see TPTB not intervening too much in the election. The emergent behavior we saw last time may be unstoppable, of course.

            Speaking of the excessively online, the last person you would expect it from, Pedro Gonzales, yesterday pointed out on X that the trajectory of the race really hasn’t changed and Trump still remains ahead (put aside the likelihood of murder, imprisonment or fortification). This means Gonzales is just a shill and not crazy. Whether that is preferable is hard to say.

Throwing around stereotypes of TDS women as being blue-haired and nose-ringed is all good fun, but the fact is that in my greater social/professional circle of primarily Boomers/Xers, perfectly normal-looking and even attractive women, plenty of whom have children and grandchildren, are all afflicted with TDS, all in on Kamala, and couldn’t care less as to how Joe was removed and Kamala installed. This goes for a whole lot of men as well.

        Boozing has been a point of machismo for Danish social democrats and civil servants since forever. I once interviewed a couple of pensioned junior permanent secretaries in the Danish prime minister’s office, from their service back in the eighties, when the office was run by twenty men. They said they put away a hundred bottles of hard booze every week, plus what they drank of wine and beer. At one interview, me and the guy finished off a bottle of whisky in the three hours the interview took, with him managing three fourths.Some social democrat prime ministers, like legendary booze- and pussyhound Jens-Otto Krag, would go off on multi-day benders, and have their chief of staff trawl through lowlife Copenhagen bars to find their PM, because the Chinese trade delegation was waiting for him.Another time, our foreign secretary Per Hækkerup, slipped his handlers en route to Finland where he was due on a NATO summit – he’d absconded from the plane during a fuelling stopover and gone boozing in Sweden. It took him five days to get back to Denmark.

Just so – and I suspect their alcohol culture was a way for social democrats to emulate their Red Army heroes.
But it was another country back then, back when you were a pussy if you had a problem with drunk driving. When I was a teenager, I hitchhiked around Europe and did day labor on farms for food and pocket money. One French peasant I worked for would drink five bottles of wine per day, operating heavy machinery.

Another thing they took from us. Lots of kids explored Europe this way back in the eighties and nineties, now menial farm work is all done by brown scab labor

                Funny story about the Soviet bomber crews. Apparently, they fueled these carrier-killing, Mach 3 missiles that could either be tipped with a 2,500-pound HE warhead (bad) or a small nuke (far worse) with grain alcohol. The Russian name for the very nasty to fly Tupelov Tu-22 bomber was “missile carrier aircraft” which the ground crews dubbed the “booze carrier aircraft.”Wonder if the balloon went up in Europe, how many of those crews would’ve thought they were launching a fully fueled missile at one of our carrier groups and have the thing run out of fuel and splash down in the ocean minutes after launch?

                    That is a good story, but it sounds like fanciful cold war propaganda or simple humor from our side, sort of like saying the Soviets only used vacuum tubes in their electronics. Sure they did, in older stuff. But they also had later tech, either fabricated in country or sourced via the black market from the West. Surely aircraft based missiles would be solid fueled?

        “like a failing bank”
It seems like our host is beginning to finally understand.  A failing bank is the perfect analogy.  America went kaput, failed, bankrupt in 2008.  That is why everything gets worse each year, because no one will tell the empororer he has no clothes.  Honestly people, is your 401k/fake corporate job so important that you’ll watch the country completely collapse so you can pretend those will be honored?

        A couple of notes:This is not 2020. Unlike then, both conditions (we are defacto at war with China and Russia) and alliances are different. Trump has crypto bros, a big chunk of Silicon Valley, the Defense establishment, and now a growing chunk of the business establishment not keen on handing over their power/positions to 20 something nose ring power Muslimas embracing Kamunism and liquidating the Bourgeoisie. Not to mention — all that Hamas stuff as repelled a lot of influential people like Bill Ackman right straight onto the Trump train.Polls that are reality based show little movement from when Biden was on the ticket — people are tired of endless inflation, endless immigration in massive criminal waves, endless woke, endless other stuff.I do think the regime will try and stuff ballots to Kamunism, but we have had four years of Obama pulling the strings for ever greater doses of Jonestown Kool-Aid, and important power centers have had enough. Every million illegal immigrants (or legal ones) makes a carrier group go away for lack of money. Kamala’s instant citizenship and open border makes ANY defense spending impossible. Raytheon, Boeing, etc. all know it.That means unlike 2020, there will be important institutional players demanding Trump: A. the Defense Community and industry, which wants Trumpian tariffs to re-industrialize, regroup, re-supply before conflict, the Biden tax subsidies failing as usual; B. Silicon Valley which is still mostly ad based and Kamunism based on impoverishment means Government take over and Zuck being just a gofer for some twenty something Muslima; C. Wall Street money men smelling the Hamas.I would not say its a done deal, but the Musk journey from ardent Obama/Biden supporter to regime enemy (mostly because after taking his money the DNC decided he was no longer important) is instructive. Raytheon is not getting a big sustainable contract when nearly 100% of the budget goes to support of instant Americans imported from the Third World.Smart money says elite splits = Civil War.

        Well they’ve performed the first act for any failing enterprise: They’ve canned the current management (Slow Joe) and brought in new management in the vain hope they can turn things around.
Sometimes it works (Lee Iacocca at Chrysler in 1978), most times it don’t.

            Iacocca was a great leader, but the Chrysler turnaround could not have happened without a huge government bailout.  The only way the government can bail itself out is by turning the money printing presses to 11, which resolves the debt crisis but crashes the real economy.

                The Biden stimulus plan was the government bailing itself out. A huge amount of that printed money went to government employee pension plans, broke city and state governments, etc. As you point out, the real economy was crashed (they’ve been lying about the numbers since). And, of course, nothing changed and nothing was fixed.

                Hate to be the ACK-SHOO-AL-LEE guy but Chrysler Bailout V1.0 did not see the US Government lend them dime one:“Well, he (Iacocca) wanted $1.5 billion in federally guaranteed loans, which would be coming from banks. These were not gifts. These were just loans that the federal government would guarantee. He hoped that that money would give Chrysler about two years to bring its new products into production and get itself turned around.”“The government also took all of Chrysler’s assets as collateral. Meaning if the company went under, the government would be paid back first.”The US Government became “The Lender of Last Resort”, guaranteeing the loans the banks made would be repaid if Chrysler failed. But the banks made the loans.Chrysler Bailout V2.0 yes, the US Government bailed them (and GM) out with taxpayer money.

        And compounding the barely repressed panic among all the fanatics is the vague understanding on all levels that this is as “popular” Vice President MegaMaid is going to get, right now. This is it, she’s topped out, because every failure of Joe Biden will fall on her head, domestic and foreign, while the Bad Orange Man simply has to not step on his own dick, and present himself as a potentially serious candidate. Which he seems to be making an effort to do so.Then you do have the near certainty that Bagel Land will ensure that it will do whatever it takes to ensure Bagel Land’s preferred candidate comes out on top, and right now, I’d bet they would prefer the BOM to Quadroon.

            Who is the most popular candidate among the Finkels? It’s a good question. In their heart of hearts, of course, they’re drawn to dieverse Leftists like iron filings to a magnet. Equally, they recoil from non-Leftistgoyimlike pixies from a pile of fresh moose dung. However, the fact that the hordes of dieverse savages hate the Finkels even more than they hate the BEIDs, is finally penetrating their thick skulls, and they may vote for their survival rather than their ideology. Hard to say. My guess is the male Finkel vote breaks for Trump, while the yenta vote goes to Cackula. But money is more important than votes, and the bulk of the great Jewish wad will be placed on Trump’s roulette wheel numbers.

But if the bagels and the Rooneys decide that they will quietly not fund or fraud for an antibagel Party and hand the state to the BOM, that can happen. Especially if they see Shapiro as their future Presidential hope, throwing Kamala and her faction under the bus while positioning Shapiro as the Party’s new hotness by having him Resist The BOM for four years might be a strategy.

                        There’s room here for an ancient Jewish joke, one that’s not (to my ken) even disparaging of The Chosen:At some future date, the unthinkable has happened. A Jew has been elected President. (He might even be named “Shapiro”. Why not?)During the inauguration festivities, among the many invited is his mother. She’s being interview by the local TV stations. Beaming with pride, the first words out of her mouth are “My other son is a doctor!” 🥯

                The “Genocide” faction that has been operating our former government without effective pushback for 4 years has their own (mostly African) ballot fraud system.Control over the “Empire” faction’s vote (electronic/ tabulation) fraud machinery will be the determinative factor, giving Pres. Trump a controlling proxy (who will demand 10’s of pounds of flesh in compensation) to counteract the Genocide Faction’s fraud.Ladybug Linda Graham recently publicly opined that Gov. Kemp of Georgia’s “machine” (Ladybug’s word, not mine) was at Pres. Trump’s disposal. Georgia is a property of the Sea Island Group, which I classify as an element of the Empire Faction.

        I actually saw a beta test of this in the off-year congressional elections. On assignment for work, I kept seeing these weird yard signs that said “IbelieveSo-and-So can win.” I was curious enough about it that when I got home, I looked up So-and-So. Her (natch) opponent was one of those GOP Swamp Things who’s been in Congress since it met in Philadelphia. There was absolutely no way this person would lose, and the Democrats knew it, so they tried out that “believe” rhetoric. I thought it was just a one-off from some junior cult member running xzheyr first campaign, but no  — they’re going nationwide with it.

        As I await for approval, I will note that two things about Harris have taken hold in popular discussion:She is a habitual drunkard. Once mentioned, it cannot be unseen and her every public appearance seems to indicate she’s smashed into incoherence, worse than Jimmy Fallon. People have had enough of a figurehead and that includes formidable institutions like the Defense Dept, Silicon Valley, etc.She is full into Communism and all that implies. Which scares the hell out of not just ordinary people imagining bread lines but threatens powerful people with being ordinary. Wage price controls are a direct threat to Corporate America as even the most powerful CEOs are going to be reporting to some much younger, more diverse and vibrant bureaucrat who has the real power.Fundamentally, this election is a referendum on either going back to the old ways (Trump) or moving all power and control to vibrant and diverse new bureaucrats employed by the Harris White House but practically controlled by Obama. Powerful people now have their ox gored.

            This is why I’m not 100% sure who the election will be rigged for. But I am sure it will be rigged. Perhaps there will be competing riggers. That would be entertaining. If required to bet, I’d put some pocket change on Kamala, but not any serious money.

        Anybody who votes for someone who is part of the same regime who got us to the point of $9 hamburgers, $20 an hour burger flippers, 20% inflation (calculated under the more accurate 1980s formula for CPI), open borders (remember, Kammy was our Border Czar), the best jobs being offshored and wars that are none of our business all over the place is absolutely insane.I completely understand hating Trump, but I can’t understand doubling down on the same failed policies and the same puppets who put us in the current situation.Pop into some metro area Walmarts these days.

            I hear ya, but one must consider the “low information” voter.  Hard to believe, but they exist and perhaps are the bulk of the populace—I include both Dem’s and Rep’s.  These are people with no clue as to anything regarding economics, world affairs, nothing of importance that would lead them to vote in a thoughtful manner.  Hence my hobby horse of “earned” suffrage.  These people should not in any way direct the affirms of the country.

                You’re right. They should have to take a basic exam, like what you take to get your driver’s license, to get a voting license. Idiots shouldn’t be allowed to make decisions for the rest of us.Yesterday, we were arguing about it being fashionable with so many people on the right wanting their kid to be Mike Rowe (never mind that he’s an actor) instead of going to college. That energy would be better spent making the argument that we should exclude people from the Ivy League-type schools from government. We need more people in government who went to Ball State and Alabama, rather than elite Eastern schools.

        I’ll admit I can’t figure out whether TPTB actually want Kamala elected or not. Some might think Trump better on Israel, but Democrat support for the Palestinians is mostly rhetorical. A resounding loss would probably allow the Democrats to finally execute the long predicted pivot from blacks to Latinos, which is inevitable at some point. Mayans make better peasants than Africans, and that seems to be the social structure TPTB are aiming at.Trump himself is probably too much of a narcissist clown to be much of a threat, and he would be an instant lame duck anyway, but Vance represents an alternative elite that could conceivably displace the current order. I don’t think they want to risk that, as it’s the only thing they truly fear.Kamala’s election would also encourage them to go full Maoist, as they already are in Britain, France and Germany. They probably think that is ultimately necessary to maintain control.It all depends on how much they are willing and able to push the fraud. One way or another, we will find out in November, or December…or January.

        “Anyone who has been part of a failed enterprise or has done a post-mortem on one is familiar with the weird psychology that comes to dominate the leadership of the enterprise as it reaches its final stage.”I’ve worked in a couple myself. Top brass tries to put on a brave front (mustn’t scare the rank-and-file or the customers) at the same as it’s arranging golden parachutes for itself or finding alternative employment. Those among the rank and file who are privy to what’s actually going on or can read a balance sheet and income statement try to find alternative employment for themselves. Those who can’t find other jobs live in a state of both hope and fear, and pray for a stay of execution. But there’s something fake in the atmosphere, a forced conviviality and false cheer.“The Democratic convention is something like the lavish parties the mortgage industry threw for itself in Las Vegas in the months leading up to the crash.”After Daenerys moved on from Astapor to Yunkai and then Meereen, the good people of Astapor found themselves in serious trouble. So they decided to have one night of riotous partying after which they committed collective suicide.“Like a failing bank, Americans may prefer the happy talk of their rulers to the reality of their lives.”I doubt it. One thing I note in passing is that some Americans — who have the means — are opting to apply for residence permits and citizenships of other countries. Even if they don’t plan to leave immediately, this insurance policy might come in handy in the future. Life under the brown Daenerys is definitely going to be a downhill ride.

            collective suicide
When the godawful W was re-elected in 2004, several leftists committed suicide in prominent places. One chained himself to a statue in Manhattan and blew his brains out. If by some miracle Trump gets back into office, it is easy to envision a far larger number of the loon legions going full Jonestown.

            After the dot com bubble burst, I got some work trying to sort the financials of a company that failed and was part of what amounted to an asset sale by the lenders. Instead of bankruptcy, they suspended operations and sold off the IP and other assets, including the company name, which apparently had some value in its niche.One of the things I found was mountains of binders and published documents related to sales and marketing. It was incredible. The people who produced the material were from elite colleges and you could tell. It was very attractive work and full of the latest words and phrases, but entirely disconnected with reality.The one amusing thing was I found written on one of the financial statements the words, “No one has any idea who will buy this stuff.” It was like a message in a bottle. Whoever wrote it was letting the world know that not everyone inside this thing was mad.

                I read an article the other day that said high level people in big companies don’t think that consultants like Bain and McKinsey are worth the money. They’ve very expensive but put the companies on an endless transformation treadmill that may or may not bear fruit long after the checks are cashed. One thing is for sure, though, these big companies will continue to hire consultants like Bain and McKinsey.

        &gt;A form of social proof manifests where everyone inside overlooks the problems because management remains optimistic.
Before mass layoffs, a lot of employees were offered work outside their wheelhouse that they refused because they thought they were safe, even though they were charging overhead for months. A lot of this was due to overly-optimistic management that thought a project was just around the corner, and they took vague social proof at face value and refused to see reality in the face. Tinker Bell effect indeed.

        I was at mt Vernon last weekend. I don’t think I’d been there for forty years. Hell of an estate. “Enslaved person” was explained by the tour guide (I had of course heard this newspeak before but never assumed it would ever be explained, or that it deserved an explanation ) but apparently it’s cause a slave is property and slaves are not property so they say enslaved person.so is a slave a person? Yes? So why isn’t that good enough? Whites are at the van of this my friends. Being anti racist is important to most whites.oh yeah, there was a woman with a Harris t shirt in that said, “make America laugh again”. You could change it to” laughed at”, drop the again and it would be more realistic.

            I was watching the Little League World Series yesterday with the Closed Captions on.  Whenever someone spoke something other than English, it said, “global language being spoken.”  The hell?…   “Global” language?  It quickly dawned on me that the retards working the captions believe or were told to believe that “foreign language” is exclusionary and something more, well, global needed to be used.  And there you have it.  Even if someone’s speaking an Amazonian tribal tongue that only 100 people understand, that person will henceforth be speaking a global language.

                    There’s an interesting story related to that.  Turner had purchased Jim Crockett Promotions in 1988, which he would rebrand as World Championship Wrestling.  Of course, an old wrestling trope was the use of a “foreign object” by one of the heels.  At one point in the early 90’s, when good ole’ boy Cowboy Bill Watts was running WCW, announcers were told to begin using the phrase “international object” as a way to take the piss out of the Turner execs pushing the Orwellian language rules.

                        Watts was fired not long afterward when Wade Keller (a known sodomite), who published thePro Wrestling Torchnewsletter, made sure that WCW execs were aware of an interview he’d done with Watts a few years earlier.  In it, Watts, who had owned a sizeable wrestling promotion of his own at one point, had advocated for freedom of association in matters of hiring and firing, going so far as to say that if he wanted hire based strictly on race, why shouldn’t he?  It’s his company and his money at risk.  Naturally the sissies in Turner’s front office  decided to cancel Watts.  This took place 30 years ago.  For thirty years they’ve been perfecting this game.

        At some point, the people in charge begin to assume their plans to arrest the decline are working as their default position, rather than taking a wait and see approach. A combination of hope and the desire to remain optimistic clouds their view of reality.
Gee, my experience is that the execs and board start actively looting the company right before they bail, playing hot potato to see who gets left holding the rotten spud that’s left.

                    Somewhat OT, but I was having lunch in a big chain restaurant a couple of hours ago, and as is always the case in such joints, the boob toob screens were unavoidable. Indeed, practically the only time I “watch” TV is when I’m out in some public venue where I have no choice in the matter.Anyway, I glance up at a screen and it’s showing some dude with a razor and he’s about to shave his junk! Christ almighty. I dam’ near hacked up a load of guam right there in front of God and everybody. Turns out it was an ad for something called the Gillette Intimate, which seems to be a special razor designed to shave the bloody wong.Christ in a sidecar. Is there no end to the perversion and degeneracy? Rhetorical question, wot.
