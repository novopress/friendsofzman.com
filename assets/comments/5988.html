        If you are a serious enemy of VDare, you would read it and never allow it to be distinctive in any way except where it dipped into socially unacceptable opinion. That is what the Democrats and Republicans did to the Dixiecrats. Forget whether Johnah’s on the side of the angels or the side of the devils, his advice to not even read VDare is just politically dumb. If the incident is true (I’ve got no way to know) it causes me to lose respect for him.

        “Jonah and all “good conservatives” will lock shields with their Progressive brothers”
But the Progressive brothers will not lock shields with Jonah and the good conservatives.

And today, ¡Yeb! has echoed Trump’s call for a temporary halt.
What a pathetic tool he is.  He’ll be outta here after he takes a political dirt nap in NH.

        Excellent analysis of the progressive morality triptych which has co-opted “our side.”  Trump has survived the goring of many oxen.  Do you think he could survive the use of the ‘nigger’ epithet or would the earth open up and swallow him whole (like the end of Don Giovanni)?

        Remember when Jonah’s Mummy Lucianne Goldberg was calling ZZ Tops “Terrorists” because of the beards? Still, unlike her son,  Lucianne seem to have smarten up and sound like to be on the Trump bandwagon, from her postings…http://www.lucianne.com/latest/

        Is it unreasonable to think that media outlets like NRO are literally bought-and-paid-for by the Progressive Left? I don’t know what kind of person Jonah Goldberg is–maybe he is simply prone to overdramatization– but your anecdote implies that he regarded VDare as an actual existential threat to his livelihood, instead of merely a fringe blog espousing views he didn’t agree with. Seriously, in the early 2000s, NRO’s traffic must have outnumbered VDare’s by a factor of at least a hundred to one. How is that a threat, unless your very livelihood is at stake?

            For the Tribe any dissident opinion is a existential threat, thats why they try so hard to control the debate between the “Left” and “Right”.

                It took me a very long time to understand that all Progs who pull the levers of opinion detest democracy for the odious beast that it is. Their vision not being obscured by false sentiment, they seek to train the beast like they would any domestic animal, and they have succeeded. That they have paid so little attention to the true condition of their own minds fits right into the democratic gimcrack.

        I’m not much of a Trump supporter but I’m sick of “This is not who we are”.  Right media tries as hard as left media to control the debate and even what the hell we’re allowed to think.I resent it.  Tell me what you think or know, state your case, then allow me to make up my own mind.  I’m 65+ and have worked full time since I was a kid, had two employers fold up but never collected an unemployment check, carried a rifle for 18 months in the mountains of VN, paid off loans and mortgages, helped my wife raise two decent and productive kids who are now married and try my best to be a good grandfather.  And I paid my taxes every step along the way.  Lots of taxes.  Me and a lot of other Americans.I’ll make up my own mind based on what I’ve learned from a lifetime of experiences and lessons, some the hard way.  I’ll listen to those who’ve earned my trust.  There aren’t many inside the Beltway who qualify.

            Yep. I’ve said many times now that I was never a Trump fan, I’m still not a fan, but the reaction from people I thought knew better has me enjoying the show. If trump swings the wrecking ball through the GOP, so be it. They asked for it.

        A problem with running things for a long time, the two parties forget there are ideas other than theirs. Leaders of the ruling parties, then, are unable to recognize as valid any belief not springing from party headquarters. The response: “This cannot be true! This … OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!”

        Trump is probably not a “true conservative”, and might govern as lawlessly as Obama has done. But the old school conservatives offer no alternative to the status quo, none. Continuing a failed policy is foolish, so Trump, Cruz, and Carson offer alternatives.

            I don’t call myself a conservative, because I can’t keep track of the meaning. The guys who own the brand name “conservative” tell me that to fly their flag I have to be in favor of the police state and endlessly bombing the muzzies. I’m not interested in any of that. They also tell me I have to want a big complicated tax code that will make people do things they otherwise would not do. That sounds a lot like socialism to me.Trump, I suspect, has not thought much about most of the big issues. I think like a lot of people, he is patriotic and was in favor of what sounded like a good idea at the time. As long as he was free to make deals and make money, he was not losing sleep about this stuff. For some reason he got religion on immigration and that has unleashed his patriotism, which was always there.

                Seem that if they want to kill you, the least you can do if close the border…Mohammed, if you recall, decapitated 1,000 JEWS (the Banu Qureiza tribe) in Medina, and his Mafia is all set to beat his record…Libertards seem to say say “patriotic” is bad?

                The word “conservative” no longer has any meaning in contemporary American politics because, quite simply, there is nothing left to conserve.  The social contract as laid out in the old constitution has been destroyed by the managerial-administrative state.  Only the first and second amendments remain in something like their original form, and as a result are under continual attack.What Goldberg and others of his ilk especially despise about the Trump candidacy is that it has forced them to tip their hand, so to speak, so that their play acting as the “principled opposition” has been revealed as a sham, and that their true allegiance, when push comes to shove, is with leftist shibboleths and the leftist state.But the real crisis that festers in the background of the Trump phenomena is not so much with the managerial-administrative state per se, as it is with it’s underlying purpose and direction.  A generation or more ago, that state, post-constitutional as it was, could at least be assumed to be acting, for the most part, in the interests of the average American.  But beginning in the Bush years, and doubling down under 0bama, that state is now actively hostile to the interests of the average American, as it demonstrates on an almost daily basis. And average Americans have noticed.  That’s why Trump supporters don’t care a fig about Trump’s previous positions – they perceive that he speaks for their interests and that he is the only candidate that even bothers doing so.

                I keep waiting for someone talking about the “true conservative” to give a definition.  Even when challenged to do so, they are obviously stuck.
Maybe we need to give up the label and look for the characteristics and philosophies we want in a candidate?
