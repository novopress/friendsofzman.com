        Followed the building houses outside of Israel piece. A linked piece was about Jews vandalizing Christian graves:https://stgdesktopcore.jpost.com/israel-news/article-726682?utm_source=spotim&amp;utm_medium=spotim_recirculation&amp;spot_im_redirect_source=pitc

            And in another, they propose complete takeover of Palestine. The argument sounds like the recent lies being told about Cheddar Man and casting Europeans as colonizers of a black people in Europe.https://stgdesktopcore.jpost.com/opinion/article-726559?utm_source=spotim&amp;utm_medium=spotim_recirculation&amp;spot_im_redirect_source=pitc“The Torah refers to Eretz Yisrael (the Land of Israel) as sacred to the Jewish people, and it has been so since the time of Abraham. It is the place where Jewish civilization began and flourished for more than a thousand years, where the Holy Temple stood in Jerusalem, where the kings of Israel reigned, where prophets spoke, and one that is documented in texts, archeology, and literature.For Muslims and Arabs, however, Palestine, its Latin/Roman name, has little significance, history, or culture. During the Crusades, Muslims sought to restore it to their rule through jihad (holy war), vestiges of which persist.”

            Coincidentally, the latest Claremont (“American Mind”) podcast is the most repulsively and anti-intellectually establishmentarian thing I’ve ever heard. Having no familiarity with the facts of the current dispute about the Speakership (they don’t know “what they [the deplorables] want,” despite its having been publicly declared), they side with a picture of Gosar and AOC collegially hanging out over the people’s desire to be represented.
Truly ugly shit. The attack on Z was the announcement of an all-hands rhetorical change over there.
Bla bla Strauss blah etc.

        “The nationalism expressed by people like Hazony is situational. Israel can build settlements in Arab areas because it is in their national interest. Russia, meanwhile, is guilty of imperialism when she moves to defend ethnic Russians from Ukrainian fanatics underwritten by the Global American Empire. This sounds like the same old neoconservatism that has plagued us since the middle of the last century.“
Left or Right, the Tribesmen have only one “principle “: Who/Whom. Realize that, and all becomes clear.

        this is off topic – but do you think that freedom of association would do a lot to make the illegal immigration problem manageable. So for instance, what if there was a policy that illegal immigrants could only gather in areas south of the 37th parallel and west of the 97th meridian. That would solve a lot of problems.

        The kvetching on this bitchsite dot com is legendary. However, I’m not seeing anything inspiring. The Sikh and Patels together have more money and influence than con inc or these dissident losers.
And y’all show no signs of adaptation and/or improvement.

        I mean really all of this can be distilled down to “The Jew cries out in pain as he snows you with rhetoric, cleverly disguised logical fallacies, and special pleading.”
Have any Jewish “conservatives” ever been anything other than chickenhawk warmongers trying to get goy males rubbed out in endless wars?  Or on the economic side just trying to defend their pornography and opium cartels as somehow a product of the holy free market and thus intrinsically good to all the libertardians?

            Well, to be fair, there is Paul Gottfried and Ron Unz.  Peter Brimelow of VDare said his major funder for the purchase of the castle was chosen.  Michael Levin wrote “Why Race Matters,” although I don’t know his politics.  Am I forgetting anyone?
The world is complicated.  Unfortunately, sometimes crude solutions are our only option.

                The big dividing line seems to be Jews that reject the chosen mentality where morality only applies within their own group.  I’d surmise that most of them drifted away from Judaism over the centuries to become Christians, and the remaining Jews have been heavily selected for moral particularism.  Thus you have the present situation where for every one Ron Unz you have a thousand Ben Shapiros.

                    Every up &amp; coming young would-be Sanheder has to go through the “draw of the straw” [cf Flavius Josephus***].The Council of the Sanhedrin convenes during Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur or similar, and all the up &amp; coming young Sanhederin take their turns learning whether they will be assigned as fifth-columnist infiltrators of the Democrat party or fifth-columnist infiltrators of the Republican party.For instance, circa Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur of 1983, an extremely urgent meeting of the Council of the Sanhedrin was convened, to decide the dispersal of the estate of Meyer Lansky, who had died in January of 1983, and whom many historians now believe to have been the wealthiest man of the 20th Century.Presenting themselves before the Council of the Sanhedrin in 1983 were two competing clans: The Pritzkers &amp; the Adelsons.And the straws were drawn, with the Pritzkers drawing the long straw, ergo becoming the primary funders of the Democrat Party, and the Adelsons drawing the short straw, ergo becoming the primary funders of the Republican Party.This sort of thing happens to all of the up &amp; coming young would-be Sanhedrin: They draw straws, learn their fates, and head out into the world to subvert &amp; destroy whichever institution the straws determined they would subvert &amp; destroy.All of your ostensible j00ish “Conservatives” – Milton Friedman, Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz, Michael Savage, Dennis Prager, Jonah Goldberg, Ben Shapiro – are simply the schmucks who lost the draw of the straw.Although it would be fascinating to learn which faction more despises their idiot goysiche lemmings: the long-straw-winners assigned to tranquilizing the lunatics in the Democrat party, or the short-straw-losers, assigned to torturing the idiot mouth-breathing masochists in the Republican party?PS: I was completely unaware that Peter Brimelow had taken j00 money.I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, but certainly it was disappointing to read.PPS: What is the deal with Peter Thiel? Somebody seems to have appointed him as the King of Right Wing Sodomy – who the hell would have had the authority to have done that?The Ghost of J Edgar Hoover?===============***PPPS: Flavius Josephus, of course, being a j00, didn’t uphold his end of the bargain.Surprise, surprise, surprise…===============PPPPS: The really fascinating piece of historical evidence which we lack is the name of the Sanheder who drew the long straw circa 41 or 42 AD, thereby defeating Saul of Tarsus, who drew the short straw, and was assigned with infiltrating and destroying the nascent Christian religion.Fortunately, the Gnostic Gospelist outlived Tarsus, and Christianity was not completely destroyed [although it was grievously injured].

        Followed the link to the Israel now talking to Russia bit. The story underneath is this typical, headline sounds great, contents are disastrous, story:https://www.axios.com/2023/01/05/biden-border-policy-humanitarian-parole“Driving the news: The new move takes a carrot and stick approach to border crossings.The carrot: The policy offers legal entry into the U.S. under humanitarian parole for up to 30,000 migrants and asylum seekers a month from Nicaragua, Haiti and Cuba — in addition to Venezuela — senior administration officials told reporters.Applicants can apply from their phone, but must have a U.S. sponsor and go through a vetting process.The stick: It leverages Title 42, a pandemic rule, to rapidly expel to Mexico up to 30,000 migrants from those nations each month if they attempt to cross the U.S. border illegally rather than going through the parole process.”The clown show continues. Biden calls on Republicans to help. Looks like Mayorkas and his mafia will easy back Repubs into a corner where they’ll cry and capitulate.

            RealityRules:  This is why, although I think Peter and Lydia Brimelow are lovely people, I no longer support VDare.  They have, for reasons I well understand, stuck purely to the ‘immigration restriction’ side of the argument (trying not to be tarred as rayciss etc.).  But the very idea that somehow controlling the border and/or limiting immigration now is going to make any difference is laughable.  Birth and death rates alone ensure European Whites (currently officially 57.9% of AINO) will be a minority by 2030.30k a year – of brown/black people from some of the southern hemisphere’s worst shiteholes, is DOUBLE the number of people living in the rural county to which we are moving in a short while.  There is no rule, no border fence, which will counter that numerical reality.   And that is on top of the 1 million ‘legal’ brown/black immigrants who come annually, plus all the ‘tourist visa’ overstays, plus all the river crossers.Whites still pushing the immigration issue have been fighting a rearguard action for decades now, and it is a waste of resources.

                Do you recommend whites/Americans, give up on the border? Throw it open?  It might be a rearguard action , but as can be seen in the Trump /Biden contrast, rates can vary.  Biden has basically given a stand down order to the BP and tossed Remain in Mexico away.

Siege warfare is an entirely defensive strategy that can only ultimately lead to defeat. A better strategy is to build a larger self-sustaining community. Apartheid. There. I said it.

                    Wj:  It is ALREADY essentially wide open.  How will closing it (which is not the policy of anyone in congress or potential candidates for any national office), with the current demographic mix, do anything to stop White replacement?  Working to close the border (which will never happen) without simultaneously beginning massive repatriation and enacting blood and race-based citizenship, is a waste of time and resources.  It doesn’t address the larger issue – just as the ‘banning’ of abortion doesn’t address the issue of brown/black birth and crime rates, White family formation, reproductive technology, inter-racial rape, etc.Issues are not simplistic, one-step things, but voters are simplistic.  They think they’ve voted to ‘close the border’ (which again, they won’t do) and the follow-on demographic consequences will never be addressed.As a former visa officer, I repeat:  Waste of time and resources at this point.

                        I think the argument to close the border now is for precisely this reason. Per the 1/3 number written below, what would you do, have it be 1/8 or 1/16?
The war analogy is giving up and keeping the border open is turning your back and running – a total route where nobody is left standing. Closing it now is holding the line and getting terms that give you time to build a position of greater strength.

                    What 3g4me has laid out so sagely is a populace addition of approximately 2% of the current country numbers with non-Whites per year!  Add to that the Boomers will be leaving us at a rate of .5%, while indigenous non-Whites still out breed Whites and I see a path for a White population no greater than 1/3 (130M) in little more than a generation.This is no less than a population replacement on the scale of Argentina in the early 20th century.  There is no digging out of this hole. One can only wonder what the downfall will be with non-Whites running the country.

                        I made a post a few days ago about Canada’s demographics by age bracket. The “White” % (and ours doesn’t include mixed or arabs) is basically the same between ages 25-34 and 0-5. If you factor in race mixing this means that whites actually have a higher birth rate than non-whites, or perhaps more accurately, non-whites have a lower birth rate than whites.Between the huge race mixing rate in the US (20%) and high fertility Latino immigrants, you guys are becoming a minority much faster among young people. We only have a 7% interracial marriage rate, and low fertility immigrants.But really that 20% race mixing rate is going to really hurt the white numbers.

                “They have, for reasons I well understand, stuck purely to the ‘immigration restriction’ side of the argument…”Not true, 3g.  Every month (usually between 8th and 12th) VDare publishes a monthly roundup of black-on-white murders from the previous month.  Avg count is around thirty or one a day.  Any one of these murders if the races reversed would be a national news story, but since whites are the victims, there’s nothing to see here.  I know of no other website that does this.  So in defense of VDare they are doing a great service highlighting this daily genocide. I send this monthly roundup to some of my well trusted friends and it never ceases to shock them that they never heard of these crimes.  It is indeed a silent, complient genocide of white folk.

                    Boris:  Valid point.  I, too, share some of those stories with a friend.  I repeat, I have nothing but respect and liking for the Brimelows; I just feel that setting up the kernels of lots of small Oranias and some sort of White community in the hinterlands is far more important, at this stage, than agitating to limit immigration.  Standard wisdom about shutting the barn door after the horse is long gone.

                        Agreed.  Barring a man made or natural calamity in the next 5-10y, this country is truly demographically, culturally, and intellectually fkd primarily due to pro-immigrant, anti-nativist policies. If nothing else, VDare and other sites like them will provide sort of record that there were actual people during that period who tried to yell “fire” in the movie theatre, but no one cared to hear.

        As others here have mentioned, the idea of whites becoming explicitly racially conscious is what terrifies the ruling class. It is their defcon emergency.It’s a strange dichotomy – white people must not think in group racial terms, yet we must also be ashamed of being white. Race doesn’t matter at all – but white people are evil. Race doesn’t exist – but we must constantly pander to POCs and listen to their whining and white hatred. Whites should be ashamed of our race and heritage, but POCs must be proud of their race and heritage, even when they have no connection to their homeland.Everything has race-blindness injected into it. Race blind “Far right” movements are allowed to stick around a bit, back in the shadows. Churches say we’re all God’s children. Anti-lockdown talk about how blacks have a lower vaccine rate. Anti-immigrant people in the UK bash on Poles and Romanians. National Conservatism, well Z-man just went over that. But anything pro-white is immediately de-platformed and often subject to law enforcement attention. It cannot happen.The other thing is that whites continue to display an in-group preference through their actions. But they must publicly profess a commitment to race-blindness, perhaps even to the point where they don’t acknowledge their true motives to themselves.“Housing prices” seem to be the new excuse for white flight – they make no mention about the impact of having hordes of hostile third worlders filling up their neighborhood. Regardless of what they tell themselves though, whites are still choosing to live, work, and raise their children around white people.Whatever system comes in the future must be explicitly handle the race question. It is the biggest topic (even an obsession) in our society today, yet also the most feared and ignored. The race issue will be dealt with as we adapt to the demographic era. The scary part is that it will not necessarily be a pro-white system. It could be anti-white, like South Africa. Or it could be something neutral like Singapore. Either way, I believe a racial reckoning is inevitable and the former West will slowly adapt to new systems, with some kind of answer to this question.

            The shame of it is that it will most certainly be anti white.  This is because so many whites loathe themselves and would rather be mauled by blax and browns than thrive with their own people.  Purging society of leftists and leftism (juice) is where it must begin.  I don’t think we will be able to obtain any racial unity amongst whites.  Leftists must be physically removed first and punished with extreme prejudice so as to ensure they cannot rise again.  The whites remaining can then unify racially.

        Nation-wide Amren chapters has been suggested. It should be obvious what would happen: each chapter will end up with a looks-huwhite-to-me contingent that will work tirelessly to co-opt the group and turn it to their purposes, and to make members afraid to speak openly.
You can have any kind of group as long as they are shepherds in the midst.  But…
You ain’t got squat unless what have is explicitly White European.

        Trying to organise ‘the right’ into any kind of fighting force is like herding cats.  Purity spirals, circular firing squads, the perfect is the enemy of the good, fighting on the left’s terms, dancing around the (((real issues))), endless think tanks and conferences, in-group/out-group gatekeeping, grifting chancers, Lucy and the football, here comes a new saviour, muh principles, I’d rather lose than use their tactics against them, etc., etc., etc.The obstacles are mostly on ‘our side’, then.  About all we can do for the time being is buy our toothbrushes and garden tools from people who don’t want to kill us.  Wonderful.Thanks to this blog and the comments, I’ve faced reality – it’s race and it’s (((them))).  You’re a dissident if you dare to notice it, which means you won’t be welcome anywhere there’s a buffet.

            It’s more than race and our special friends, but without addressing race and our special friends, you’re gonna get nowhere.
As difficult and unsolvable the race issue has proven to be, it is by far the easier of these 2 issues. I wouldn’t even know where to begin on the jay cue.

                In China, one of the first progressive Premiers after Mao was pushing the adoption of the capitalism model.  He said, “What matters the color of the cat–as long as it catches mice?”
I tend to agree, but…in this case it’s white mice that catch mice.  Colored cats are not adequate to the task in this rat infested country.  😉

        I beg to differ on your assertion that “.. After all, Israel would not exist without the British then the Americans.”British Empire self interest naturally led to pro Arabs policy during their Mandate rule, blaming the Jewish underground movements for their forced pullout in 1948. Likewise, similar balance of power assessment tilted American policy towards the Jewish state from a prior Arab-leaning policy only in the late 1960s.

            In (not particularly super-insightful) hindsight Israel benefitted mightily from the Cold War.  If GAE was willing to actively side with various Hispanics, Koreans, Vietnamese, etc. in thwarting totalitarianism then no one would think anything of adding Jews in to the mix.

        You folks need to get out and mingle with more billionaires lol. But in all seriousness, having dealt with a lot of these guys in business, I can tell you first hand that once you have a billion dollars and all the trappings, you want to be taken seriously as a public intellectual and patron of the arts/sciences. So Peter Thiel and his ilk have their personal “petting zoo” of intellectuals hanging around to amuse them.Contrast this with Musk, whatever you may think of him and his EV grifting, who actually takes personal/financial/political risk engaging with the Deep State.Also contrast this with the NRA Convention, which routinely attracts thousands of regular folks. Organizing around basic rights (I can’t say “natural rights” here anymore haha) like 2A and maybe freedom of religion, speech and assembly/association seems like a better organizing principle than abstract, coffeehouse stuff like “national conservatism”, whatever the hell it means.

Musk wants to be Tony Stark – a brilliant engineer rather than a dorky intellectual. He has spent hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to hang out with real engineers, he even paid to fraudulently have his name put down as a founder of Tesla.
If he’s even real, that is. The more I read about him, the more convinced I am that he’s a deep state asset.

                    I don’t even know about that, I never used Twitter. But as Bilejones links below, Musk is producing scam after blatantly obvious scam, he’s never called on it and he’s being funded by big ticket investors who are paying some very smart tech guys to know better.
So he sits there, telling the interviewer that SpaceX is going to out-compete long haul airlines by flying people to Australia onintercontinental ballistic fucking missilesand the guy just nods and pretends to believe him.
He smells like Elizabeth Holmes.

                    Also, Starlink is suspicious as hell. It makes zero economic sense; I figure it’s a military or alphabet agency project. SpaceX is 90% Starlink missions, and Starlink is financed on a Ponzi scheme, same model as Solar City.
Apart from that, Starlink is a scandalous pollution of the global common. The full network is 35,000 birds – more than quadrupling the number of satellites in LEO – and they need to be replaced every five years. The space junk they’ll produce will make launches more expensive for everybody else.

            I think, for the people out here who do believe, we’ve got to “keep it simple.”They have neither the time or the inclination to wade through the crap we tend to read and think about every day.  They are pretty busy — out here in rural, working-class fly-over land — just working, raising a family, and trying to keep ahead of the fallout from the upper reaches.They understand the larger issues here, in easily-digestible portions.  But they have lives to live.  If we expect too much, or don’t make it simple and comprehensible, we lose them.It can’t be like the Romans during the 2nd Punic War — from four legions, they went to some huge number under arms for 20 years.  Depopulated the countryside, ensuring the discharged soldiers then came home to abandoned farmsteads, and destroyed the steady, self-reliant class of everyday Roman citizens.  Rome in effect cast them into the cities as urban poor, and a created a terribly unstable ingredient in their social mix.We have to adopt the method of Daniel Morgan at Cowpens …. give them a plan, and only expect what they can give to the movement, whatever that may be.  But in the end, their assist can be critical.

        I keep mulling over the isms, but I keep coming back to debt. Article at Unz this morning helps. Sick of listening to and arguing with these people? Sick of the imposition? Get out of debt. No occupying armies oppressing your body but occupying ideas oppressing your mind. No foreign gods squatting on your churches but stuff you don’t own smothering your spirit. Yeah, less purchasing power, but so what it’s a rat race. Owners dictate terms.Whites have proven extremely extremely difficult to conquer in the traditional way, at least by outsiders, but we’re idealistic people. Haven’t had this thought in a long time, but capture our imaginations, and you’ve captured us. Word and money magic, moving images, etc.

            Also why we need to move back into the “culture-creating” sphere — maintaining, propagating and defending our “story” in the arts.  The fact that all our myth makers due their hair blue, pierced their genitals and stormed off to the left has been nearly fatal to us.
So we, and our defenseless offspring, are then an easy mark for “capture” by the purple-haired crazies of the creative class, one of our opponent’s key weapons.

                Getting (and staying) out of debt is a great defense. Again, less purchasing power, and culture is a consumer product these days. So you make what you can’t buy. Also freedom from the creditor’s demands. Also also it’s good for the spirit— a moral good. (Not that I haven’t had my failings staying out of debt lol.)
Kind of flogging it, I realize, but it probably is that fundamental. Poor —&gt; rich—&gt; slob—&gt; slave. With accompanying moral progress, in the broadest sense. Hopefully poor again with rediscovered discipline.

        This is semi off-topic, but within the ballpark.
I have to recommend the television show “Men  Who Built America: Frontiersmen.” When a historical series gets the biggest criticism that it is too pro America, I had to see it. The episodes showcase foundational American heroes such as Andrew Jackson, Kit Carson, and John Fremont. It doesn’t perform hero worship of these men. Their flaws are displayed as well as the actions and deeds they are known for. The unapologetic tone though, is refreshing.

        National Conservatism (NC) is basically Sailer’s Citizenism, i.e., a joke. NC is a scam to protect Israel and keep whites from joining the identity politics game. Nothing more.Does no one ever ask Hazony or other speakers questions that expose their hypocrisy in regards to Israel? I’m guessing that they vet the audience to make sure no one rips off the mask.NC’s Statement of Principles is a Normie CivNat dream, so I’m surprised that the GOP hasn’t adopted them. They could keep Normie subdued for another generation.It is fascinating how the principles are so very carefully crafted to protect Israel and the Jews – but not any other nation or people. Like any con, it’s obvious if you know that it’s happening. Here are some of the principles and my question to Hazony.#1 – National Independence“Each nation capable of self-government should chart its own course in accordance with its own particular constitutional, linguistic, and religious inheritance.”You’ll notice that they mention religion but not race. The shape shifters strike again. Jews aren’t a people but are a part of a religion; therefore, Israel is fine under this definition. You’ll also notice “capable of self-government,” so hammering the West Bank is fine because they aren’t capable of self-government.Question: Mr. Hazony, you’re description national independence fits the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza. Should they be allowed to be a country and if so, wouldn’t Israel be an imperial power attempting to take away their right to exist?#2 Rejection of Imperialism &amp; GlobalismSame question as for #1#9 ImmigrationNC walks that fine line of saying that immigration has been great but too much immigration has been bad. It’s all about assimilation – and never about the race of whom you let in.Question: Mr. Hazony, you say that immigration – in the right amount for the time – has been a huge benefit to the West. And, of course, you mean that immigrants can come from any country and be of any race. However, Israel strictly limits its immigrants to ethnic Jews. Are you willing to call for Israel to open its immigration to non-Jews. If not, and if you argue that Jews have a “cultural” tradition that Israel wishes to preserve, why does Israel allow in secular Jews who don’t follow that culture? If you allow in secular Jews, you should allow in all non-Jews?Again, if NC is based on culture and not race, why should we not condemn Israel for limiting its immigration to ethnic Jews?#10 RaceTypical colorblind CivNat stuff, though, like Citizenism, they’re careful to avoid saying that there are no group differences, only that you can’t judge an individual on their race. Very Sailer like. Again, NC is a nationalism based on culture, not race.Question: Mr. Hazony, your form of cultural nationalism has been the ideology of the conservatives for the past 50 years, and yet, it has failed miserably. Liberalism’s identity politics based on group identity including race has become the law of the land with race-based policies in every government, college and business. Why do you think that doing the same thing will change our direction?

All hyphenated or compound nationalisms are civic nationalism.
Even “ethno-nationalism” – technically a tautology – is an implicit flavor of civic nationalism, because it suggests there are more than one kind of nationalism.

                Exactly. Nationalism is ethno-nationalism. The world nation comes from the Latin natio which represents the children of the same birth, i.e., a people.

            Very nice post. Our movement needs to hammer on Israel’s policy. Why is it the only “Western” Democracy(TM) that has such ethno centric policies? Why is it the only one where it is permitted, but others are corralled into the Great Replacement. This is the path forward. Ask this of J. Peterson, Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Rogan, Rubin, Weinstein, Friedman and the pantheon of “Rightists” Force them to answer the question and put this into their comment sections relentlessly.
Also, I propose a showing of anti-racist Hitler:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqUh4P-10TM

        “And I will bless those who bless you,And the one who curses you I will curse.”  GenesisGrowing up steeped in the evangelical/Baptist tradition in the 70’s-80’s, I heard a great deal about how America owed it’s global success to being a “great friend of Israel”.  Men like Rubio pander to this sensibility; Israel encourages it in many ways.Seems ridiculous now that a religion (Christianity) that was made anew with the New Testament and is treated by Jews as sort of an ultra-retarded offshoot of the Judaism gives so much weight to this.You’ve a generation of boomers and Gen X steeped in this mysticism that makes about as much sense as “woke”.  Which is to say “no sense at all”, modern nation states did not exist as we conceive of them until the 19th century.As stated elsewhere here: the USS Liberty attack should have raised some eyebrows.

            Modern nation states may not have existed until fairly recently, but the ethno-state has been the norm since the dawn of time.
Nationalism is ethno-nationalism. Indeed, ethno-nationalism is redundant. In Latin, “natio” represents the children of the same birth and also a human group of same origin.
God I hate civic nationalists.

                Cue the violin section.
If Jews really had it so awful among the goyim and others, why didn’t they remain in ancient Israel and expand it into a greater Israel if they felt it necessary? The fact of the matter is, Jews, like all other peoples, live one helluva lot better among whites than they do among their own. And whites, in turn, live one helluva lot better without the social pollution known as diversity. I deeply hope we find it within ourselves to separate from you permanently.

                    In cases like Anna’s, I guess that she instinctively believes that what is good for her people must be good in some absolute moral framework.  She literally cannot conceive of the possibility that her people are in the wrong in even a single situation.

            imbroglio:  Blah blah blah  “a fantasy of racial/ethnic purity.’  Blah blah blah.

                All those tests are nonsense for resolution of small signals, essentially checking for similarity to common haplotype blocks. Unless you are getting your genome actually *sequenced*, then small signals are at best to be interpreted as entertainment.At worst, it’s deliberate misinformation to normalize the undermining of ethnic cohesion so that we can be more easily predated upon. I have no proof of the latter assertion, but if I were a (((special))) owner of 23&amp;Me, it is exactly what I would do. I don’t assume that I am smarter than they are, so I assume that they will take any opportunity to engage in perception management of those they see as their human cattle.Also, the devil is in the details: WHICH genes? All hominins shared common ancestry (all life on this planet shares common ancestry). There is no human on this planet that does not have some alleles in common with Africans. The question is, for an individual of European phenotype, are the alleles of the genes in question anomalous to European populations? That question is not one the tests of 23&amp;Me can answer.Also, for my two cents: I don’t care. It’s beyond silly for anyone to worrying over trace signals in genomic structure. We have newlywed women being macheted to death inside stores and little girls being tied to trees, raped, and strangled with their own shoelaces. Neither the problem nor the solution requires scientific pattern recognition to understand.

                    Horace:  All you’ve said is correct, of course, but my retort was not about my personal genetics – I was projecting what was behind Imbroglio’s snarky version of “Jevv Hater.”  No idea what his genetic background is, but his mindset is definitely anti-White.

                    American Krogan has a good 1 hour video on his Odysee channel on such topics. One thing that he points out is that on-line dating sites are openly promoting white myscegenation, particularly black/white, while promoting inter-Jewish matching. He cites publicly published studies by the dating sites.
So, we can throw the question marks away. There is definitely a coupling and breeding psy-op distinctively aimed at whites that Jews are excluding themselves from.

            See my comment below on what Brog has been up to. He is one of many. Noticing subversion via gross acts of treason is not bashing.Now. As for getting back in, I think that was Z-Man’s point. There is nothing to get back into. Some other comment pointed out that Chip Roy the angry Texas cowboy is nominating a magical one. This in a time where, well, look everywhere around you. In politics symbolism is the starting point for everything, and that symbolizes not just deference, not just a willingness to let some other lead your cause, but utter humiliation and complete defeat.As for a platform I’ll take a shot:1. End affirmative action and all racial quotas in all institutions2. Destroy all DIE bureaucracy in all institutions.3. No reparations. Perhaps we should go farther – create our own reparations campaign since we can calculate the damage and point to countless cities destroyed and money and time wasted. Go on the offensive and point out the truth instead of groveling.4. Open and transparent discussion and analysis of American foreign policy – particular emphasis on bribery, (aka lobbying and campaign donations), and money granted to foreign nations.5. Immediate federal defunding of any and all education systems; establish local councils nominated by every municipality to adopt curriculum. Outlaw any curriculum with any trace of anti-American and DIE tenants and precepts.6. Immediate halt to all immigration. Hearings and mass audit of asylum cases since 2002 (War On Terror initiation), as a starting point. Immediate deportation and repatriation of anyone on an asylum court hearing list and anyone granted asylum since 2002. Granting of academic and IT/STEM professional visas frozen until said deportation and repatriation is complete. Mobilization of US military personnel and equipment to close the border. Completion of US border wall under military protection. Open discussion of Israel’s border, deportation and demographic policies as a model for American policy. Withold all aid to Israel, until our border is fully secured. Upon achieving border security, re-assess all foreign aid.7. Immediate audit of DHS/TSA/FBI/CIA contracts and foreign nation entanglements. Follow up with cancellation of contracts for equipment procurement and agent training from and by any foreign nation. Not sure how to proceed with any of these departments or how to grant equipment and training contracts. TSA agents don’t seem like they receive any training anyway.8. Immediate hearings and discussions of welfare reform. The premise is, if we have a shortage of workers, then we will do job placement for welfare recipients. People in regions that were victims of offshoring via free trade agreements have top priority in job placement. Inter generational welfare recipients who are incapable or unwilling to engage in work will be enrolled in a deportation program.9. Criminal charges and trials for all judges and DA offices and participants in the release of any criminal that resulted in a violent crime against anyone.10. Immediate hearings to analyze all mass looting actions across the United States since 2020 and full accounting of FBI and local law enforcement action and inaction in protecting US citizens and businesses from brazen open air criminality.I am guessing most here would agree on this. I don’t see anything in that which is based on a fantasy of racial purity. It does to me look like the beginnings of fighting our way out of the current situation of being a borderless, bankrupt, non-nation whose political system and policy making is open to and dictated by the highest most organized foreign bidders. It seems to me to be a step toward restoring a non-nation whose majority population is being openly replaced and villified while said replacement is masked by a fantasy that somehow it will end in a utopia of a rainbow village, holding hands and singing kumbaya serenaded by an orchestra of unicorns and candy sprinkled, transgendered elmos.

            The American Empire has a soft form of Devshirme, where instead of outright kidnapping, children of conservative parents are subtly corrupted to be religious fanatics for the new order.
As fertility falls further and further down a cliff, the shrillness of thr increasing numbers of barren women to indoctrinate children to their cult will intensify.
There’s never been a society I know of where families with children with be a strong minority, but we’re starting to see it.  Notice how little politicians talk about family now.

                And it’s going to worsen before it improves.  There are a lot of boomer conservatives.  Once they pass on, it will be a coalition of spiteful single white women and minorities outvoting everyone else for the following 30 years.   Once that generation passes on, there might be a chance, but we’ll be a minority by then.  I just hope the current Supreme Court wakes up and returns our freedom of association in the meantime, so the states can have some autonomy again.

                    As I have remarked before, the Boomers in general had a terrible generational impact, but losing them is going to be a catastrophe, at least in the short run, politically, socially, and economically. Regardless of what they may have been earlier in their lives, at this moment they are a force for conservatism and a reserve of competence, along with the older Xer’s. Yes, there are a good many conservative and competent Millennials and Zoomers, but as a percentage, not nearly enough. The worst thing that happened to America in the second half of the 20th Century might have been the advent of the Boomers – the worst event of the first half of the 20th might be losing them. It’s a funny world, isn’t it?

Collapse, winnowing, hardening. Then the timeline for a brighter future shortens considerably. No return, but thankfully also no loser conservatism, with nothing to pretend to conserve.
It’s the crisis that ushers in a new era. Those who belong to the past are in mourning, those who belong to the future— ready or not.

                    For all the Boomer hate, they are the only people keeping things somewhat “sane” and they way they were. The last supermajority white generation and majority Republican voters.
Change is not necessarily a bad thing, but be careful what you wish for. Those who attack Boomers viciously might not actually like how things look once they’re gone.
Change from the Boomer norms is a good thing, and necessary. But it’s going to be a long slog. Certainly not something I feel glee about.

                    This is great commentary on Boomers by everyone on this thread.
I get caught up sometimes in the generational generalization politics, and this is a reminder that it isn’t a healthy practice.
We blame the zoomers, but the fact is we are living in the degenerate phase of progressivism – something that the Wilson/Roosevelt back room uniparty coalition put together over Marcus Hanna’s dead body long before the Boomers were born.

                    Davidcito:  If you are relying on the courts and the government to ensure your ‘rights’ then you have none.  And if you seriously expect AINO and voting to be on the schedule for the next 30 years, it is no surprise that you are equally credulous about the courts.

                The modern world is very weird in that “having a family” is a category of lifestyle choices rather than the natural course of things. However, an infant mortality rate of virtually zero is also a huge break from the past, so our politics are weird in that there is a widening divergence in household size, leading to an unprecedented political difference.

                    The birth rate difference between vaguely defined “left wing” and “right wing” whites is enormous. Doubly impressive when you consider the enormous levels of brainwashing and demoralization aimed at right wing whites. The opioid crisis is probably hurting our birth rates quite a bit too.The “left wing” whites have lowest-low, extinction level Asian fertility rates, while the “right wing” whites have birth rates on par with India/Mexico.It really is like we are two different peoples. Maybe we are. Hard to not see it as some kind of sorting event. But the chasm is a relatively new thing, white liberals really stopped reproducing in the past 5-15 years. Will be interesting to see how it plays out. Is it possible that they just end up replacing themselves, not us?

        The replatforming of Gottfried, Beattie and Richwine at this event while continuing to ban the Brimelows and Jared Taylor was especially bizarre.  David Brog was asked about it in a round about way and according to what I read clearly hates the dissident right people they have banned, it isn’t at the behest of some donor.  When pressed, they won’t give any explanation for where they draw the line and why.  I assume that part of the reason these men were replatformed is that they are Jews.  If you had to pay to be at the conference, you have to feel like a sucker, the speakers are obviously interested in networking for cash/their next gig.

                “According to David Krone, Harry Reid’s chief of staff, Brog was key in securing House Republican support for the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which passed in 2016.[1]In July 2015, Brog was tapped to head a new group called the Maccabee Task Force, an entity formed by American philanthropists Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban to combat Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions BDS activities on college campuses. Brog’s exploits as head of the Maccabee Task Force were featured in an Al Jazeera documentary titled The Lobby.[7][8][9] Brog was seen as a surprising choice due to his position far from the mainstream within pro-Israel position,”From the Wiki. What nation openly allows foreign agents to operate like this? The anti-BDS legislation is a direct affront to freedom of speech. Apparently, this anti-BDS is written in as a pledge to disaster relief funding. Think about that. A bunch of farmers get flooded out, and as a condition to getting relief funding, they have to pledge to not participate in boycotts, (iow sign away their first amendment rights), of a foreign nation. Outrageous.Here is the answer. A nation that allows foreign agents to openly infiltrate, (it is not infiltrating but don’t know the word), religious organizations and our government, and to pass legislation that violates our most sacred natural right, is not a nation.I wish I hadn’t heard of Brog. I am going back to bed, and waking up all over again in a do over. The outrage of this is insane.

        One aspect of these conferences that always seemed strange is you are apparently hobnobbing with the strongest minds in politics, with some of these guys being very successful writers, have large think tanks associated with them, and  yet they seem to have trouble getting 300 or so to attend, and they let anyone who isn’t a public bad-thinker in.  So for all these movers and shakers, they have trouble finding enough people around the country to hang out with them in a hotel room for a couple of days?I can see AmRen or CounterCurrents keeping that many, with the risk or getting thrown to the void in what is still a niche ideology, but what’s their excuse?

            I read a comment from someone who attended this conference who said he had to go through a verification process and was asked questions about why he wanted to attend.  Hazony is practicing strict control over who gets in the door.  Part of it is optics, but it seems like he does want people there unless they have at least a little money to throw around at these various speakers and groups.

Reading National Conservatism’s Statement of Principles is hilarious. It’s obviously a carefully crafted scam to keep populism and actual nationalism in a controllable box.
Everything is about keeping whites from joining the identity politics game. If that ever happens, the whole system falls apart – and our rulers know that. This is their #1 goal all day, every day.

                        The problem of course is that the Neocon position of “Ethnostate for me but not for thee” position is logically un-supportable, and they know it, and people are starting to notice. Guys like Hazony are desperately trying to square this circle, and in doing so are having to make a few very important concessions, no matter how many caveats they have to load them down with; this is almost certainly a good thing for our side in the long run, because if guys like Hazony have to concede a white ethnostate in order to save Israel, that’s what they will do. The problem is, there are neocons out there who hate the idea of a white ethnostate more than they love Israel, and would sacrifice the one to destroy the other. Dangerous people, to all concerned.

        One wonders if “giving street cred to guys like Rubio” isn’t the real point of these things. I doubt the average Jose, Pajeet, and Jonquarious Sixpack out there in “America” even know there’s something like the House Speakership going on. But the people in the Apparat know, and they care, because they are more deeply invested than anyone in the system of “democracy” that created them. They need the kabuki to continue, and that’s getting close to impossible under the current arrangements. Guys like Rubio are stupid, but they’ve got a kind of low cunning; they can sense which way the wind’s blowing.The fake “opposition” is obviously getting a whole lot faker, in other words, so it’s also going to have to start getting a whole lot more vocally “opposition” to keep things running.

        Somewhat on topic:As I’ve said on here before, I do find value in reading mainstream news as a dissident. As I’ve read the main stream regarding this speaker of the house drama, I’ve seen numerous pundits call the five holdouts, “far-right extremist conservatives.” Then you listen to Chip Roy give his speech, and he’s quoting the religious prophet of the elites, MLK, and nominating a magic black man as an alternative to McCarthy. Then he sits and rolls over for his masters on the left and makes a comment about how “this is a time where two African Americans are being nominated for speaker.” And there’s thunderous applause from everyone. If this is far right extremism in America, then I want out of this place.

            The Greek:  Heartfelt upvote.  It’s all a clown show, and it was immensely funny . . . until the nomination of the magic black candidate.  Sure, fight about one swamp creature versus another.  Posture about principles when you’re animated by personal spite – makes no difference to me because you’re all equally slimy in my book.But turn your grandstanding into yet another front of anti-White hatred and cloth your motives in numinous negr0 cred, and it’s no longer funny.  There’s a special lamppost waiting for these guys – I don’t give a f**k about McCarthy, but start pushing the magic MLK talk for civnat and/or woke cred and it becomes personal, you pieces of shite.

                    Some-one at Severian’s place had this to say about the numinous negro:“In 1997, Donalds was arrested for marijuana distribution; the charges were dropped as part of a pre-trial diversion program. In 2000, he pleaded guilty to a felony bribery charge as part of a scheme to defraud a bank, which was expunged after he entered the Florida House”
So he’s a fully qualified piece of political filth.

                I agree 100% 3g4me. Roy postures as the angry cowboy. I actually thought he was one of the few people who is on our side. Wrong! We’ll know them by their refusal to replace themselves and us in the process. It is infuriating.
I also agree with the stupidity of the experience factor. Perhaps the ploy is to get their own Obama-puppet magic boy. It doesn’t matter. Symbolism is critical. Our people need representation not humiliation, deference and resignation.
Get this phony cowboy out of the saddle and slopping hogs on a dude ranch where he belongs. Disgusting!

        A lot of words for: don’t talk about race!  don’t talk about race! don’t talk about race!  Don’t mention that traditional America was a white country,  and when it’s non-white it won’t be America!  Don’t give any white people the notion that they have a right to a homeland.  Just the latest attempt by some conservatives to rationalize their participation in dispossessing their own people and culture,  a last ditch attempt at pretending “civic nationalism” hasn’t been a disaster.  For others, more cynical and evil, it’s gas-lighting to keep that dispossession going.

        Perhaps this is a symptom of the general groping for a compass heading taking place in conservatism.  Simple adherence to the past is not working, but you’ve got a couple generations still steeped in the “what we need to do is talk about a flat tax” mantra.  The cohort that hasn’t met a war they wouldn’t want to send your kids to.    Lots of people still afraid of hurty words from Left.  And we still keeping hurtling towards an abyss.  We don’t have a generation yet that hasn’t know American hegemony.  I see angst and confusion.

        Can we not have anymore talk about any movement with conservative in it’s description? Especially if it’s jew flavored.
These things are all grifts of some sort, personal power plays or rebranding of the same old conservative bull.

        “Hazony’s events are the bar in Star Wars for dispossessed right-wing intellectuals.”
“The result is that national conservatism is sort of island of misfit toys.”
These hilarious lines make me think that National Conservatism is a way for me to relive my childhood entertainment.
“This sounds like the same old neoconservatism that has plagued us since the middle of the last century.”
Yes.  These people are masters at crafting narratives that convince us that their goals are our vital concerns.  “Slowly, I began to …”  Well, maybe you know the rest of that line.

            This “movement” is no better than the IDW. It’s also clearly staffed with the usual suspects.
I’d rather have Peter Thiel or Elon Musk’s money being funneled to “conservative” causes than the alternative, but unfortunately all the “conservative” billionaires are libertarian rightists. When will we get the authoritarian rightist billionaire?

                Give them time. Musk and Thiel have been moving slowly in our direction for years, and my guess is that they’re both somewhat farther to the right than they’re publicly willing to admit.
At this point there seems to be a lot of people trying to keep one foot in the respectable mainstream while toying with dissident ideas.
That is an inherently unstable position, and sooner or later they’re going to be forced to jump to one side or the other. I suspect there are a lot of thoughts being thought that aren’t getting spoken. Yet.

                    Musk has exposed himself to enough normal people to develop some sympathy for them. His apparent rightward movement is him echoing a handful of the average American’s least forbidden pleas for justice, the ones that don’t freak out *every* shitlib. He’s never going any deeper than that. When he gives Twitter back to the professionals, he’s going away.
Thiel is…
What if Bill Gates knew who we are and wanted in on our thing? Would that be good news?

                Marko:  Is there even any space today between libertarianism and zionism?  Axiomatic support for Israel can call itself whatever ‘ism’ it wants, but if any putative ‘conservative’ or ‘nationalist’ ideology doesn’t include the term ‘White’ or the somewhat more general ‘ethnic’ then it’s clearly just another rearranging the benches to hide the White European elimination chamber.

            Don’t blame the Isrealis for that one.  They pulled the trigger, but our disingenuous/traitorous government covered for them.  A betrayal of the highest magnitude.
