        Federal authorities charged four Americans on Tuesday with roles in a malign campaign pushing pro-Kremlin propaganda in Florida and Missouri ‚Äî expanding a previous case that charged a Russian operative with running illegal influence agents within the United States.

        Scary pilpul right here, in that ‚ÄúRussians are coming‚Äù case in FL:  ‚Äúallegedly weaponized our First Amendment rights ‚Äî freedoms Russia denies its own citizens ‚Äî to divide Americans and interfere in elections in the United States‚Äù
Boom.  There‚Äôs the kill shot they‚Äôll use going forward.  ‚ÄúWeaponizing the Bill of Rights‚Äù means we have to take away the Bill or Rights.  For your own safety.
Must give the devils their due, so skilled at manipulating words.

            Terms of Service Country is all fine and well ‚Ä¶ until there is a serious conflict with peer competitors that can generate extinction for the regime and ruling class (and perhaps the country as well).A certain eye of S‚Äî- type has called officially for Regime Change in China and also breaking that nation up into different parts. This has not been received well in Beijing.The US has for now, enforcers who can and will enforce the will of the Elites/ruling class for the Terms of Service. However, there is very little industrial capacity for War. We have one plant in Lima Ohio that can produce the M-1 Abrams. Output: 2 tanks a month. Russia has at least six different tank factories that can produce their top of the line tank at 200 a month, collectively. The same holds true for missiles, shells, air frames, and the like. As far as mobilizing an expeditionary force across either the Atlantic or Pacific, much less supplying it at the end of a 5,000 mile supply line, and organizing and motivating it to fight, forget it. Forget too building a new fleet. America has neither the industrial capacity nor the WWII work force in waiting that could produce over 50 carriers from 1942-45. All those dudes floating over the Rio Grande or crossing into Arizona are not even fit to run a 7-11, much less wire or weld or assemble the complex machinery that comprises modern naval vessels. Much less work in a steel foundry to produce the steel needed for the vessels.Russia and China know this. Neither is going to be gentle to the regime and its elements calling for their own regime change and ‚Äúdecolonization.‚Äù So there is that.

                Is this why Raytheon is now offering up to $20k signing bonuses + relocation to try and get bog standard engineers to move to Tuscon?
They‚Äôre offering the unicorn engineers signing bonuses up to $50k.
I wonder how those clowns feel about all their DIE initiatives and mandates now?

                    I bet they love their DIE initiatives.  They may indeed have a lot of slugs on board, but it keeps them in compliance with Fed mandates.  What‚Äôs killing them, as with all other engineer heavy industries, is probably the retiring White work force and the lack of suitable replacement options being produced by the US University system.Hell this is true even when White ‚Äúengineers‚Äù are found and hired. Son works in one of those engineering tech heavy corporations here.  They simply can not find degreed engineers and when when the do, they are found under/unproductive.  Trouble with such, as with AA, is the concern over morale when some personnel don‚Äôt pull their weight and others have to handle their work load.The productive people avoid these people and these ‚Äúfuckups‚Äù are even given names.  Case in point, two new hires:  ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Do‚Äù and ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Do‚Äù.  In staff meetings, these ‚Äúnicknames‚Äù are even used in discussion in place of their real names.  üôÅThe way this particular corporation makes due is to have (sellout to) foreign ownership and move many engineering divisions/responsibilities overseas to their new owners‚Äô facilities.  The engineering shortage is not that bad there.However, the US loses as the facility shrinks.  Shipping jobs out of the country is not always a scummy capitalist move to make money.  Sometimes it‚Äôs simply survival in a dying society.

Well said!
I would only add that *some* of the H-1B push is the flipside of sending jobs overseas.
On a certain level it is a pragmatic reaction to a dying society that is seeing masses of experienced, knowledgeable people retire fron the workforce while simultaneously failing to internally  replace them with similar numbers of high-quality young people.

                        The young guys are smart.  They just don‚Äôt see an upside.  Why work hard at X job that will give you less than inflation yearly pay raise, work you into a divorce and medical, and have zero loyalty to you when the market turns?
You guys are stupid, you think hard work for the corporation pays off.  Enjoy your fixed income.
Let me put it another way you know who did really well while Rome burned?  Farmers in Gaul.

        Free speech has been cracked down on in America for much longer than we‚Äôve been alive, unfortunately.In the 1930s 30 million people listened to Father Coughlin‚Äôs radio broadcasts and newspaper where he had an isolationist, anti-FDR, anti-establishment perspective. The government forced his radio program off the air and closed his newspaper before banning him entirely from politics under threat of losing his priesthood.  Other individuals purged for wrongthink include journalist John T. Flynn, who no one has heard of today but who was bigger than Walter Lippmann in the 1930s; historian Harry Elmer Barnes ‚Äî who played a central role in ‚Äúrevising‚Äù the history of the First World War so as to remove the cartoonish picture of unspeakable German wickedness left behind as a legacy of the dishonest wartime propaganda produced by the British and American governments; and many others include Charles Beard, William Henry Chamberlin, Russell Grenfell, Sisley Huddleston, and A.J.P. Taylor.  For a deeper dive into these figures, see Ron Unz‚Äôs article ‚ÄúAmerican Pravda: Understanding World War 2‚Ä≥:https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-understanding-world-war-ii/In 1953, historian Henry Elmer Barnes described how the censorship process worked, which remains ongoing today: ‚ÄúThe methods followed by the various groups interested in blacking out the truth about world affairs since 1932‚Ä¶fall mainly into the following patterns or categories: (1) excluding scholars suspected of revisionist views from access to public documents which are freely opened to ‚Äúcourt historians‚Äù and other apologists for the foreign policy of President Roosevelt; (2) intimidating publishers of books and periodicals, so that even those who might wish to publish books and articles setting forth the revisionist point of view do not dare to do so; (3) ignoring or obscuring published material which embodies revisionist facts and arguments; and (4) smearing revisionist authors and their books‚Ä¶ leading members of two of the largest publishing houses in the country have told me that, whatever their personal wishes in the circumstances, they would not feel it ethical to endanger their business and the property rights of their stockholders by publishing critical books relative to American foreign policy since 1933.  And there is good reason for that hesitancy.  The book clubs and the main sales outlets for books are controlled by powerful pressure groups which are opposed to truth on such matters.  These outlets not only refuse to market critical books in this field but also threaten to boycott other books by these publishers who defy their blackout ultimatum.‚Äù

            Superb comment. I have my issues with Unz but he has done a great job covering the memory holed history and chroniclers of it in the 20th century.Most of the dissident right knows about the Holocaust censorship but thinks that America was a whitetopia before Boomers.The rot goes back at least as far as the Wilson administration &amp; WW1. But like rot in the foundation of a building, it has to progress &amp; can take awhile for it to be visible to the people living there.The powers that be are lucky that Americans are not a curious people &amp; many simply want to be seen as good, smart people as defined by the propaganda arm of the ruling class.

        This isn‚Äôt mere pettiness on the part of rich people.Information is power. And while it used to be true that bullchit flew half way round the world before the truth even got off the starting blocks‚Ä¶ it no longer is. The truth and the BS now race neck and neck and if you have an IQ‚Ä¶the truth wins every time. Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt lose the election to Donald Trump‚Ä¶she lost to Pepe The Frog. They don‚Äôt care if the peons mock and laugh, but it drives then bonkers when Normies and Grillers start fact checking and do a passable job of it. The real trouble starts Whitey finds out the truth of exactly why his ancestors lynched blacks and didn‚Äôt want them in politics or positions of authority. Or the jews.The good news is that this will work for them as well as the Covid vaccine did, or the, war in the Kraine, or Hillary‚Äôs run at the presidency. These clowns literally can‚Äôt plan or execute bathroom breaks. Biden and Nadler have shit themselves in public. They masturbate during zoom meetings and get caught at it. Morons like AOC amass wealth despite having a flat line for an IQ. The only reason they get away with it is because the can is still rolling down the road. When the lights go out and the free money ends and people get cold and hungry, racial realities will come crashing back like a tidal wave. They always do‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôd look good, in jackboots actually‚Ä¶.üòÇüëç

        The general idea here is something I‚Äôve been saying, in various ways, for almost 25 years now, ever since the internet started becoming popular. I‚Äôve never really though of the internet as a technological revolution. It is more of a perceptual revolution. It changed what things were allowed to be done and who was allowed to do them, who was allowed to know secrets, who was allowed to include or exclude others.It is a revolution I never signed up for and never wanted, but most of society went along with it without question, and it has had profound practical effects. For example, there would not have been any giant tech corporations like Amazon or Google had not longstanding financial and legal practices been abandoned to accommodate them.This is one reason why I know, in spite of all evidence o the contrary, that the internet is a transient phenomenon in human existence. It simple isn‚Äôt affordable under ordinary accounting procedures. It thrives on cheap debt and venture capital, and the era of such things is coming to an end. Reality will catch up to the distortions of bubble-era finance, and probably it has already begun.

            I‚Äôd make a distinction here between the pop-internet and the tech-internet. I got on the tech-internet very early. I was hooked up to a dial-up provider and browsing newsgroups on a 486 with Slackware Linux 1.1 that I had installed from a CD I bought through the mail. That internet was basically a spin-off of DARPANet and it had only been a few years prior that no one outside universities and defense contractors has access to it at all. Connecting still required a lot of intelligence and perseverance and the culture was as ‚Äúbased‚Äù as you can imagine as a result even though the colleges always brought in the usual Commie types. There were no rules or ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù though and these people were mocked and wedgied relentlessly.I don‚Äôt think *that* internet requires much more than smart people with a desire to communicate and do cool things with technology.  It was a very similar vibe to the Ham radio community in fact though far less polite. The pop-internet came much later and is basically designed to make lots of money for venture capitalists by producing tech for morons to sell themselves to other morons while advertisers capture ‚Äúeyeballs‚Äù and tech companies take a cut of the moron-revenue. It may well be that this pop-internet is a fleeting thing. We can certainly hope so.

                Yes, I agree with what you‚Äôre saying, I just didn‚Äôt have time to expound in that direction with my first comment. The world would have been a much better place had the internet never been popularized. America circa 1990 is about the level at which the communication tech expansion into consumer products should have ceased.

                Correct.  The internet as we call the applications it supports would be nothing without the technological base it uses to communicate.  I was also there and communicating over DARPA technology using crude applications which worked fairly well within a computer, but less so as the applications communicated outside of the local environment.  Our network a that time was coax Ethernet and basically use by large computers transmitting data to each other in the ‚Äúcomputer center‚Äù.  I still remember sitting in the office late at night and ‚Äútalking‚Äù to people halfway around the world who I didn‚Äôt know, but just said hi.  Student geeks, faculty, anyone who had access to the internet and was at a terminal.At least three significant improvements, again technical‚Äînot sociological‚Äîfollowed:  faster, cheaper, simpler Ethernet, with longer distances, via fiber optics; affordable computers (personal PC‚Äôs); and the concept/development of fast and efficient searches through database search algorithms.  Only  then one finds interactive browsers (really another programming language‚Äîhtml) such as Netscape and the concept of WWW appearing.

        That Fox lawsuit is worth a mention.A few minutes of MSNBC Regime signaling- the Voice of the lord, dispensing the latest edicts from the throne- informed we peasants that the Dominion lawsuit against Fox for ‚Äúspreading conspiracy theories about the election‚Äù was settled at $776 million in a $1.5 billion suit.  Smartmatix, the other major e-voting machine company, is now suing Fox for $1 billion.
With corporate cutouts doing lawfare at this scale, that tells me the century of democracy is well and truly over.

        It‚Äôs probably worth noting that the author of the Wapo article about people being charged for saying and thinking the wrong things about Russia is Devlin Barrett. Barrett won a pulitzer for reporting on ‚ÄúRussian collusion‚Äù in the 2016 election, which of course turned out to be entirely fabricated. Needless to say, Barrett‚Äôs Pulitzer was not revoked ‚Äî he did the work his government handlers paid him to do.Barrett is an American, but interestingly went to college in Canada, McGill University, which is one of the universities with the closest ties to China. Funny that an American boy found his way all the way up there. I know that doesn‚Äôt prove anything, but what really needs to be proved. We are ruled by a cabal of degenerates that hate us and the press are their lapdogs.

                The reference to our ‚Äústrategic oil reserves‚Äù comes up regularly in this group, but I wonder if folks understand completely what the situation is.  This repository was establish under Reagan (IIRC or even Carter) in reaction to the Arab oil embargo.  A quick method to gain access to oil when needed for shortfalls‚Äîbut that amount was never more than a flew months worth of partial supplement to short supplies.However, there is an awful lot of oil in the ground in reserves that have been set aside specifically for the armed forces, e.g., Teapot Dome  (yes the one in the scandal) is one of them.  Here‚Äôs a quick link from Google:‚Äúhttps://www.osti.gov/biblio/7220430‚ÄùRunning our salt dome stored reserves down is perhaps short sighted, but there is much, much more proven and reserved for the military should the need arise.  Drilling would take a bit of time, but the oil spigot won‚Äôt turn off over night either.

            Psychoanalysis ‚Äì you got it! I would say you have an anal fixation. Your focus on the process of expelling after extended meditation, i.e. digestion, represents a stunting of development in the stage that linked the anus with pleasure. Your parents were too indulgent, thus leading to an overentitled sense of expulsion. You are probably coprophiliac based on the disordered nature of your thoughts.
Obviously, this is a jest üôÇ

            It reads like you lived your life as a pretty standard liberal.  Practically every normal liberal with whom I‚Äôve discussed politics eventually admitted to the same viewpoint: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain that my views are correct and it should be illegal for anyone to disagree, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt them, just exclude them from society until they repent.‚Äù  They only admit to this view assuming I agree with them of course, if they were debating a conservative they would re-frame all of this in sanctimonious language about preventing harm.Most liberals never grow out of it, living their entire lives unchallenged by anyone because they‚Äôre surrounded by other liberals.  If the liberal does have a non-liberal friend then that friend won‚Äôt argue with him, anticipating social or career retaliation for doing so.  Thinkers tend to drift away though, since liberalism is built on a very rickety set of premises that become increasingly difficult to ignore when you witness your 50th chimpout at a Target.

            My marker for full-blown totalitarianism is when people start to be disappeared. You see outlines of that with the 1/6 political prisoners, but they were at least openly arrested before they were thrown into the D.C. gulag.

I thought Vanguard was started by a goy from P-Town, named John Bogle.
Also, if Vanguard owns portions of Blackrock, then does Blackrock also own portions of Vanguard?

It is interesting how quickly the old advice about how quickly you contact the police if you‚Äôre involved in a self-defense shooting has become entirely the wrong advice.

Never forget if the camera footage from the jogger incident hadn‚Äôt been mad public, those guys wouldn‚Äôt be serving life sentences. They were foolish enough to think it helped their case. In the new order, there is never justification to hurt a black person.

        I‚Äôve always thought it a good policy never to say anything on the internet that you wouldn‚Äôt say in person, that you wouldn‚Äôt be willing to stand by and put your name to. Whatever the law might say about it, I don‚Äôt see freedom of speech and freedom to larp as the same thing.None of that is a defense against a regime that is intent on getting you. Nothing is a defense against a regime that is intent on getting you. They will change the definitions and legal implications of words to suit their purposes. What was normal 10 years ago is reactionary and subversive today. I refer you to Barack Obama‚Äôs hate speech as expressed to Rick Warren.It is curious that they are going after ‚ÄúAfrican socialists‚Äù for their ‚ÄúRussian disinformation.‚Äù There must be more to that story. You‚Äôd think if anyone were free to larp it would be them.The real comedy (if that‚Äôs the right word) is the GAE prosecuting people here for things that it perpetrates worldwide every day.

The story is the Regime is so insecure now that it goes after even staunch allies if they deviate from the party line. Think about the old saw about revolutions eating their own.

            There is a bit more to that story.  The guy who runs the Africa Uhuru thing is a gay black weirdo who was recently charged with a bunch of crimes before the Russia stuff.  I think it was kidnapping and rape. I forget the details.  They used to call the guy black Hitler. His big thing was black communism and reparations.

Except for the Russia stuff, all the other items there would have given the dude a high social credit score. Messing with the latest Forever War apparently is enough of a demerit to override them.

        One more nefarious issue too is weaponizing people‚Äôs social media to paint the accused as a bad person, regardless of its applicability to the case. We saw this with the guys who shot the jogger where they scoured their social media posts and interviewed countless people to see if they ever said mean things about blacks. the same is the case of the guy in Austin who smoked the scumbag who pointed an AR-15 in his face.They know what they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôre telling the jury ‚ÄúThis is a person with bad thoughts. Whether he is innocent or guilty in this case is irrelevant. He must be punished.‚ÄùIf any of us get in a hot situation with the law, first thing to do is nuke all your social media accounts, histories, etc. then throw your laptop in a river. It may not save you, but the egregious things they will need to do in order to grab the info will at least make heir life hard.

            Not having social media accounts with your name on them in the first place is an even better idea. And not posting pictures of yourself on the internet.

            That will never work. You‚Äôll never be able to clean it all up.  This is another reason not to speak to the police.  These questions about social media etc will be the very first questions they ask you. It will probably be asked as contact information.

            You are absolutely correct ‚Äì I have not, in a decade, posted a political thought on social media. They did that with the Perry case. Using social media for the purposes of showing the person is engaged in wrongthink is the perfect example of how dumb a jury of your peers is. This goes back to the OJ case. The defense spent so much time muddying the minds of muddled individuals that, even though they produced no real evidence to defend him, they distracted the easily distracted populace‚Äôs attention from the truth.This was also perfectly evident in the Casey Anthony trial. What does it matter who found the body? No one is claiming that he killed her. All smoke and mirrors, for those that are easily fooled.However, let us also acknowledge, that posting here is just as bad as social media. They track this stuff, too.

        At least I know where this is all coming from. The regime is in crisis mode. Domestically there‚Äôs an issue ‚Äî maybe a crisis ‚Äî of legitimacy. Internationally the empire is up to its neck in the sh!t ‚Äî the world is de-dollarising and the empire‚Äôs sphere of influence keeps declining. At the moment I don‚Äôt think it  extends beyond Europe and (maybe) Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Domestic crackdowns and curtailment of what hitherto have been considered fundamental rights will step up in intensity. Thus do empires flicker out and die.Some of the disparaging comments Z man has made in the past about Big Brother Biden will soon be classed as speech crime, thought crime: ‚ÄúBiden is the death mask of the dying regime‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhereas Biden was a stupid gasbag in his prime, he is now merely a doddering old fool.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs now more important than ever for WNs to band together.

            Events outside the empire are increasingly beyond their control. The deal the Chinese negotiated between Iran and Saudi is the biggest geopolitical coup in the region since Nixon and Kissinger stole Egypt from the Soviets. It heralds a new order in international relations, and not the kind envisioned by Soros and Schwab.

        The black ‚Äúpeople holding the wrong opinions about Russia‚Äù also promote slavery reparations among other things. This indicates the Regime will shut down the free speech of even its allies if they hold opinions contrary to The Current Thing. Also, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, one of the United States Attorneys involved in the case is the same one who had led the political prosecutions, torture, and other civil rights violations of the 1/6 protestors. This monster would have been quite at home in the NKVD, and it is likely he in fact has a great deal of affinity for past totalitarian police agencies.The world is laughing. And as the United States continues to recede from the world stage and grows weaker economically and militarily, expect much more of this trashy, thuggish police state behavior. Insecure nations always go this route. Mentally, the world has moved past the United States. Will we have the luxury to do the same or will the constant fear of the midnight arrest make that a luxury?

            That‚Äôs the feeling that I get. The world is just tired of the US/Neocons. Sure, the seizure of Russian assets and the sanctions were important, but it‚Äôs more about how the US has acted for decades.The rest of world has grown enough economically and militarily that it‚Äôs beginning to notice that it could create its own systems that the US can‚Äôt control.People keep focusing on the minutia, but it‚Äôs really more about a mindset change. They just want out. They‚Äôre not being confrontational. They just want to get away from these weirdos.The whole process will take a very long time, but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that the RoW (except Europe and Japan) is mentally done with the US.

The only question is what sort of war and what sort of weapons. Given the United States is now a narcissistic Jonestown, nukes are possible if not likely.

                        Yep. The Neocons screwed the pooch with Ukraine. They hoped that the sanctions would cripple Russia, leading to regime change, a regime friendly to the US.Basically, Russia would go back to what it was in the 1990s, a beaten dog that the Wall Street could indebt and loot. They would be a huge personal victory for the Neocons, given their family history with Russia.With Russia on Team USA, China would be isolated and extremely vulnerable due to no access to natural resources (US controls Russia and Saudi Arabia and can cut off Iran.)US dominance is assured for another 20 years.Whoops. Instead, Russia proves you can get around the sanctions. China and Russia become much closer. Saudi Arabia realizes that the Neocons are insane and will regime change anyone including MBS, so Saudi Arabia cozies up with China. Even India begins to understand how insane and dangerous the Neocons are.They all realize that the Neocons will never stop, ever. They have no choice but to start building alternative trade and finance systems. The US is a dead end.Again, this will all take a very long time, but the course was set with Ukraine. The Neocons couldn‚Äôt have screwed up any worse. Sure, Europe is more dependent on US than ever, but Europe was never going to move away from us anyway.Nope. The Neocons set in motion a major decline in US, i.e., their own, power. It‚Äôs stunning how bad they are at running the show. Their talent lies in manipulating highly-functioning system, not running them.

                        A Russia/China alliance is impregnable, even against the GAE. Everyone has always known this, from way back. Even the neocons know this.
The way I read it, this means the GAE has 2 choices: double down on the campaign against Russia, since it must be peeled off from China before China can be confronted, or else just accept fading away into irrelevance and isolation

                I own a small service business.

            Done through the ‚Äújudiciary‚Äù, almost all of it. And once done, and with no gainsay from the highest court, step back and behold the power of stare decisis to permanently void all of these rights. If you will, trace this back to John Marshall and his power grab in Marbury v. Madison going uncontested. The principle once established, its regular, albeit at times fitful, expansion into more and more areas of application became inevitable. The Commerce Clause, anybody? Federalism and any genuine separation of powers has died the death.

                This is true. The Russians learned some hard lessons about this topic and they have stuck. By putting clear limits on what can be said and where it can be said, they can tolerate lots of opposition media. Putin gets tougher questions from Russian media than Biden gets from Western media.

Yep. And while RT and Sputnik News have their fair share of propaganda, neither even approach the NYT on that score. It isn‚Äôt a total inversion of the Cold War (yet), but close.

                    This used to be the case in the West during the Cold War. During the Cold War, as long as people stayed away from either bad mustache man, they could pretty much do what they want, and there was little micromanaging of people‚Äôs personal lives.Moreover, there was a great deal of emphasizing not only greater personal liberty in the West but greater material prosperity. Prosperity which increased not decreased every year. Now it is entirely the reverse.The elites have bet hard, and irreversibly, on the Colors of Benetton. They truly believe that the ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù set of people will triumph just like in Marvel and Star Wars movies and the latest Star Trek diversity stuff. [Which is why Hollywood is dangerous ‚Äî elites believe wholeheartedly in fairy tales.]

                        Agreed, but it seems likely that for propaganda purposes the GAE paid lip service to civil liberties due to the Cold War. Once the GAE prevailed, the gloves came off and the screws were able to be put to its own citizens. As the United States gets weaker and poorer, the civil rights violations will increase due to lack of confidence.

        What do the models say?As inflation rises and the dollar declines, real hardship will reemerge across the middle and lower classes. This change in environment will initially manifest as anxiety and repressed anger yielding to impromptu rage fits and wanton episodes of personal violence. Social trust will decline sharply and key institutions like MSM, Congress, and the Courts will be viewed by most as corrupt and malicious. LEOs will be overwhelmed trying to deal with the attendant lawlessness that accompanies evaporating social trust. And ordinary people will take to the streets in mass protests, even here in the USA.This unrest will enable new legislation and presidential decrees that further limit personal freedom and increase incarceration of non-conformers. And the ensuing vicious cycle will turn protest marches into full-blown riots. At the least, this emotional venting will be expressed as property destruction (cities will burn).Will normie finally get his fat ass off the couch? Sorry, but no. Only 3 days without a real meal will do that. Don‚Äôt be in a big city this summer.

            Sorry, Tom.  ‚Äú[A]nd ordinary people will take to the streets in mass protests, even here in the USA.‚Äù  Not going to happen.
‚ÄúOrdinary people‚Äù are still in the DC gulag for protesting the Biden installation.  Their names are not known and they suffer alone.
If you are ‚Äúprotesting‚Äù and not a protected class, then you will be fired from your job, rendered unemployable and tossed into legal purgatory until you are bankrupted and/ or sent to prison.

Others spent more time as cabbies, or on private gardens, or anything to make hard currency than their nominal job.This is the central problem elites face when trying to organize a Palace Economy ‚Äî people will work their own interests as much as possible. This is particularly true in advanced, industrial societies where even regime thugs demand clean water, decent food, safe places for their kids, etc. The USSR collapsed because it could not (and had not for years) paid its soldiers and enforcers and found no ideology motivating people at that stage. Who will fight and die for the Colors of Benetton?

                They don‚Äôt say ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù anymore unless they‚Äôre old and stopped keeping up with the times. Since the year of Trump the language in the regime TOS has been changed to evoke mass death, not the speaker‚Äôs attitude. Here‚Äôs some from yesterday:
‚ÄúTwitter has quietly removed a policy against the ‚Äòtargeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals,‚Äô raising concerns that the Elon Musk-owned platform is becoming less safe for marginalized groups.‚Äù

            One term is ‚Äústochastic terrorism.‚Äù The idea that, having spoken the idea that, possibly, trannies are dangerous to children, the speaker of such hate facts is casting his bread upon the water and inciting violence. Terrorism, really.
It‚Äôs just another case where the old rule governing non-protected speech is being ignored.
It is true that you cannot constrain the elites with documents. It‚Äôs one reason that the old idea of having a rival institution whose interests are not perfectly aligned with the elites‚Äô was such a good idea.

        Looks like the Dominion thing is going to try and roll through many conservative targets. With the corrupt judges in their hand it could be a veritable legal blitzkrieg coming. This will fortify even more from other nefarious sources.
Freedom of speech is severely crippled as is even the basic right to defend oneself, whites mostly. Maybe this is accelerating due to the coming final collapse of our country. Our goose may well be really cooked this time., something has to happen soon as far as blowback.

            There was no blowback in the Roman Empire. It just kept declining until it was over.

            The Voice of the Regime mentioned Fox, OAN, Newsmax‚Ä¶prepping us for the Restrict Act.  Australia did this during the Iraq War years by taxing phone wires, the pole-to-pole wires by the road.  Over 100,000 sites had been ‚Äúblackholed‚Äù (wiped out) before they lost count.  The internet was decimated in Oz.
