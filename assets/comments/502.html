        as a *very* liberal MA resident, I can tell you that the Gov of Texas was not mocked for his religous beliefs, but for 3 things he said…I forget what they are
wasn’t their also that point in the debate where the crowd booded a gay serviceman ?
I will also say that I , and the people I know , admired Perry for his stand on supporting education for kids of immigrants.
