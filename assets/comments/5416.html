        I have never trusted Carley Florina, since she was involved with Common Core.  There are so many negative things out there about her and I help to share it on “facebook”  She is not for the American people, only for herself.  We need Trump.

        I don’t see how even a brilliant, charismatic, courageous, and straight talking individual could manage metastasized government, regulation, and the monetary tsunami coming at us straight ahead. It may be more sensible to stop trying to fix this thing and leave the worst people in charge. Bankruptcy can be a beautiful thing.
