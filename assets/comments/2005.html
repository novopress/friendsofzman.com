        “Another side to this is what happens to former snitches who then find themselves in trouble for crime think. Dinesh D’Souza was the guy who put the shiv in the back of Sam Francis two decades ago. It was his report of Francis at American Renaissance that got Francis fired from the Washington Times. Now, D’Souza is facing jail time and reaching out to his friends on the right to save him. As a guy who hates rats like D’Souza, I’m taking a great deal of pleasure in seeing Team Obama put the screws to him. I’m also liking the fact Conservative Inc has turned their back on him. There’s something poetic about it.”Yup, the Enemy Left has you right where they want you, eating your own kind. Fool.

        I have to ask: is the “Mary Steyn” reference in the opening sentence commentary or a typo?

        The more American history I read the more it seems to me that the Founders were those who gradually discovered themselves living on that overcrowded fringe you speak of.  Today we still have a revolution to protect because those people saw their moment.  Will we see ours?  Perhaps. Though it’s getting late, all that is necessary for conservative success is to believe again that the opposition is not invincible.  Convincing us has been the job of Steyn, et al, and their mighty pens and before this is over, many will pay a hefty price.  It has always been thus.
