        I’m Sure many people have had near death experiences in cars,climbing ladders etc.      you not only never forget them but don’t talk about them much.   Usually they are sobering events

        The fish rots from the head down. Witness President Prevaricator. How many lies have fallen easily from his lips? Yet the Leftist media pretends otherwise. Like the tree in the forest, if no one ever calls you on it, is it still a lie? We live in duplicitous times.

        He must be a pretty important guy to be protected by an “armor mechanized platoon” commanded by a Captain.

        we live in fake times. Politicians are lauded for not doing anything but pretending to care, and the ones who laud them are given awards by their own kind and praised by people like them who cannot — or will not — talk about truth.It is not so much that there are lies and maintained lies, abhorrent though such a policy is, but the lies are interwoven with untruths and pretensions in a deliberate attempt to deny reality and face facts.The whole business of the media is, it would seem, to appear ‘saintly’ in front of their colleagues. If you say the ‘right things’ you are approved, and approved leads to more approval among the small circle of humanity they move among. I once worked with journalists and I can say that they were, almost entirely, people without either intelligence or morals. They were in it for the money and the pats on the back from their mates, though one journalist did tell me she thought all her colleagues on the editorial floor were really failed novelists.Politics was never about truth, and the compliant, boot-licking media stopped being about truth and reality some time ago. The only aspect of this that is surprising is that we are still surprised that a journalist should lie and distort and fail to remember correctly.

        Fareed Zakaria  being caught serially plagiarizing and he still has his job.  That dirt-bag Blumenthal from Connecticut who claimed combat experience then remembered he “mis-spoke”.  How about fauxcahontis/liarwatha Warren. These lefties don’t have any real accomplishments so they manufacture them out of whole cloth, and the LIV lap it up.  Sigh.

        Other than the fact itself, the most important part of this story is that it took 12 years to uncover. If something as easily verifiable as this took that long, how much else is there?

        Shame that it took real troops to shame him into confessing.  However, I doubt if the lie will be a detriment to his career.  It will be ignored – and he will continue to pull down $10 mil from the network.Wouldn’t want to look in his mirror…

        He will probably be the debate moderator when Mrs. Clinton defends lying about being under fire in Sarajevo. Nothing like a bunch of amoral liberals and aging dirtbag hippies writing revisionist memoirs for their disgraceful lives. “Jug” Burkett chronicles them (including Tom Harkin, Dan Rather and others) in his book “Stolen Valor” It exposes all the poseurs wearing fake medals to get public acclaim.

        Thanks. I never knew that. Man, it is something that bugs me for some reason. I once called out a fake sniper at a dinner party. It was upsetting to everyone, but I just could not stand there and listen to the guy tell whoppers.
