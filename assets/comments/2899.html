        Thanks for the correction, Gobsmacker. I really shouldn’t watch TV news output if I am going to get the wrong impression.

        @UKER: “Judging by the news footage, just about everyone wanted to loot stores.”
At the time of the rioting I suspected much of the looting was being done by outsiders who came into Ferguson to take advantage of the chaos. This actually turned out to be the case when police started arresting people. According to news reports, the large majority of those who were arrested were from out of town, not residents of Ferguson.

        “That’s what we saw in Ferguson this summer, when Michael Brown was killed and a community was divided.”
I thought most folk in Ferguson’s community were anything but divided on this issue. Judging by the news footage, just about everyone wanted to loot stores.

        This speech delivered to the CBC was written by The Onion. Delusion, Obama is thy name. Only the term farrago begins to define the nature of the string of lies uttered by the charlatan elected twice by the media and the Democrats by commission and the Republicans by omission. That such a prevaricator could be president puts paid to the viability of democracy in the USA.

        “Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement, guilty of walking while black, or driving while black…”And too many of them, like Michael Brown, are targeted while robbing convenience stores or assaulting a police officer and trying to take the cop’s gun.  This is the result of 50 years of pandering to the LCD in the War on Poverty, the disintegration of the black family and the loss of respect of young black men for the law.  Black kids born out of wedlock and raised in dysfunctional families with no male authority figures run wild, turn to a life of crime, and then have to confront the justice system.  When it comes to the senseless waste of black children’s lives, Obama has nothing worth saying and nothing I care to hear.  Ben Carson says it all.
