        President Biden won the free and fair Democratic primaries.  Any attempt to remove or replace him is an attack on Our Democracy.

            This will be only the third time in a row that the party machinery has screwed their voters in front of their faces only to be rewarded by these same feckless, low information idiots.

            They will simply fix it so that every vote for Biden’s replacement will count as a vote for Biden.
Team blue no matter who will be just fine with this, “fix.”
There won’t be much time to mount a legal challenge, and anyone who does will be found to have, “no standing.”
See how easy this will be?

                Sounds similar to what happened in NJ some years ago, when dem Torricelli’s corruption spelled a likely win for republican Forrester.  The Party simply plugged in the Bidenesque Lautenberg at the last minute, even though it was a blatant violation of their own rules.  A few griped, the court just shrugged, and they just proceeded with the attitude “who’s gonna stop us”.

            I am already seeing MSM pushing Newsom. This whole thing is a setup.
With Newsom, the US would get a clone of Turdeau as a president.

                How about this? It’s The Atlantic, not the Times, but pretty close:
THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICAN JEWS IS ENDING
Anti-Semitism on the right and the left threatens to bring to a close an unprecedented period of safety and prosperity for Jewish Americans—and demolish the liberal order they helped establish.
By Franklin Foer

                        Protestants have a symbiotic relationship with the Jews. In fact, you can argue that they put Jews out in front as the face of all the dirty work they benefit from. They just passively aggressively benefit from it. They work together in banking and in war. And both love immigration. They’re brothers from different mothers. Catholics, on the other hand, typically don’t have the warm and fuzzies about any of this stuff the animates the other two. Well, a lot of Catholics are fools about immigration, too.

                            I don’t understand why this one has gotten so many down votes. WASPs let Jews in the front door. They let them into the Ivy League and finance. They love Israel. They let them marry their daughters. They let them run roughshod over everything. Now they let them run Harvard and the Ivy League! Evangelicals are also in love with them. Last time I checked, both of them qualify as Protestants.

                                In my roman catholic Italian family, there was no love lost for jews. My grandfather who came over from Italy in the 30’s would be watching the news and he’d start shouting “those god damn dirrrrty jews!”I agree with your assesment.There is nothing akin to American protestant Zionism in the Roman Catholic church.

                                    As I always like to point out, the indigenous Christians of the Holy Land are predominantly Maronite Catholic and Eastern Orthodox and the ones in Palestine see themselves as Palestinians. I think this is a huge reason there is no such thing as a Catholic or Orthodox Zionist.

His father’s family had lived in our small, rust belt city for a century, while his mom came to America in her 20’s and continued to spend spend much time back home.  Both parents maintained a healthy dislike of Lebanon’s newest neighbor.

                                        Agree. I guess “business is business.” My grandfather saw the political and cultural turmoil caused by the jews in Mussolini’s Italy. So he hated them for that. To the best of my knowledge he had no mafia ties. Although he did own race horses. So who knows.

                    Immigration is what it’s about. The Jews shoved it on us and we’re not happy about it. Secondary is how they stuffed all their pockets full of money by outsourcing everybody’s jobs. Thirdly, it’s all the wars and how they use Jeffrey Epstein and blackmail to control our government. Fourthly, they used what they gleaned from Jeffrey Epstein to take over our economy and enrich themselves. If this were another time and day, the ovens would just be starting to get fired up.

Yep, that’s exactly why people hate them right now. They established it. No way of pushing off the blame on somebody else. They own it.

                            Leftist disorder. How easy it is for whole threads to forget about the o’biden admin doing this to us and find a convenient scapegoat to blame, instead.
Somehow, we need to unite against the authoritarianism/surveillance/globalist machine; it’s the only way America doesn’t get crushed out of existence…and it’s not Mrs. Goldstein down the block; it’s mcconnell, schumer, and their crazy cohorts in the intel agencies to blame.  They come from all backgrounds; maybe we need ol’ Serpenthead reminding us “It’s the ideology, stupid!”

            Problem is, the characteristic causing the problem is not jewishness, but globalism. By calling out religion/heritage, we’re letting go free and clear villains w/names like bush, obama, newsome, pelosi, romney, jeffries, mcconnell, and on and on. Each of us is branded by several different identities….hope we all pick on the globalist authoritarianism and not the one that ends up hurting the nice family down the road who are of the same heritage.

        They spent the last 4 years pretending this man was competent. They could have kept on pretending, they didn’t have to put on this “debate,” and the instant it was over, the media class, en masse, in unison, began wailing about how awful he was. So this was all planned. My bet is Hillary.

                In Clown World it wouldn’t have been a problem at all. “Biden” had already spent a lot of time and effort depicting Trump as an insurrectionist and enemy of democracy; just say that it would be beneath the office to debate such a foe, irresponsible to give him a platform to spew his sedition, and the msm would have been fine with that.

                    Well, that’s a fine hypothesis. But as obtuse as the Grillers undoubtedly are, I think this approach would have radicalized another big chunk of them. And given that white “radicalism” (common sense, actually), is the Power Structure’s greatest fear, I don’t think total abstention was ever a serious consideration.

                If the polls were closer, they’d have tried it.  However, I’m positive their internal polls showed “no hope” for a win by Biden—even with cheating.  Therefore the (Hail Mary) debate.  If Biden pulled through, a win, if not, the reason needed to pull him from the ticket.

                Ah! Two birds: Zoar’s right twice, it’s Hillary…a final slapdown on the usurper faction, to put Her and the old guard in their place; then Trump to get the white boys killed and discredit the white right for the next three generations, until the Job is done.

                That’s my concern. Trump is being lined up to play Judas goats for young white males in the South and Midwest to debase and degrade themselves with military service. I don’t think it will work, but that’s almost certainly on the drawing board.

                    I agree. The GAE realizes they need to lure young White men into the military to go die for the globalist project in Ukraine, Gaza, Lebanon, and Taiwan.
This is also why they’ve turned the volume on deviant month down to 1 and there is no St. Floyd insurrection in full-swing this summer.

                        The purpose of the lawfare was make a failed former president a  sypathetic figure who could be railed behind.
It worked as planned.
Trump is the designated lightning rod to accept blame for:
The final genocide of the Palestinians,Sending Troops to Ukraine,The end of the dollar and hyperinflation,
and most of all  Mr. Warp Speed needs to be the sitting president when the truth of the vaccines are revealed.

                                Talking about biden and those behind him sometimes makes people uncomfortable, for some reason.… if I could make an arrangement where I had a stand-in, a front-man or front-woman and they had an ear piece in and I was just in my basement in my sweats looking through the stuff and I could sort of deliver the lines, but somebody else was doing all the talking and ceremony, I’d be fine with that…This was BO, one month before joe’s installation. If ya hear the sound clip, you realize he sounds sincere in a way he never did when pushing “our democracy.”They are willing to do anything up to imprisonment and a JFK action to get PDT– he’s not their guy. (Except for democrats/GOP — not MAGA — their propaganda is beyond obvious. Boy, do they give themselves away all the time!)

                Care to expound on this theory? I’m not buying. If Trump is elected he will end American involvement in the Ukraine war. He also has an established good relationship with Putin, he bitch slapped the fat Korean kook down, and China will have a much different perspective on starting any trouble over Taiwan with Trump as commander in chief. Lest you forget if you doubt my assessment, Trump started no new wars, and their was relative peace in the world while he was president. In other words, Trump has a proven track record regarding world affairs.Since the likely hood of war under Trump is slight, why would the deep state need Trump to sucker the redneck’s into the military, or for Trump to be the heavy in re instituting the draft?

                    difference between trump and biden in terms of ukrainian conflict policy is:zio-neocon sock puppet biden is willing to send ground troops to ukrainepentagon-israeli sock puppet trump won’t sent ground troops to ukraine.i know people think pentagon is completely moronic, but they are not. They know what happened to napoleon and hitler, they don’t want that to happen to them.Plan is asymmetrical warfare, use russia’s size against it. Have it be attacked on all sides by its neighbours. Put so much pressure on Putin until he cucks. Then you grab Russia by the balls and castrate it, split it into pieces.The one thing US doesn’t expect is Russia becoming merciless with its neighbours. They don’t believe Russia has the guts to level Warsaw, Stockholm and Helsinki into the ground, which they will.

                    If you go against china and iran you need a lot more troops. You just do.
You need good ol’ whitey to operate drones, missiles and other weapon systems.Unfortunately for democrats, that’s a bit harder than dunking on people at basketball, so you need a republican president.
That’s where Trump comes in, he creates the illusion whites got their country back, now you can be patriotic again and join army.

            I think it was all a matter of timing things right. They took Joe off his cocktail of meth, ketamine, and cocaine and let him rip. They knew this would be the result. Now they can hand wring about needing to find a replacement, and then quickly find one. This gives the replacement’s enemies minimal time to dig up dirt before the election. If I were going to place a bet, I would not go with Hillary. There’s too much people know about her. I would bet that it’s another Obama miracle man. It’ll be another “Hawaiian Negro” that no one has heard about.Edited to add: and just think of all the sappy “Man from Hope” type eulogies the shitlib pundits can write glorifying the mystery man. You gotta have a plan to keep those guys in their lofts in Northern VA.

                I don’t think so, because rigging has been a thing a long time and the election wouldn’t have been so close if the fix was in. In fact, Gore probably would have been more down with Forever Wars than the Shipwreck W, who was too stupid to resist them and easily manipulated. Gore willingly voted for the first Gulf War, for example, and the bombing of Serbia.

                Even the NYT after their lengthy post election investigation concluded that Dubya really did win Florida. Maybe that was part of the coup, but they were otherwise no friend of Bush.

                No, a subset of Florida blacks were too stupid to fill the correct spot on the ballot and voted for Pat Buchanan by mistake.  The Supreme Court refused to the change their votes which would have set an insane precedent.

                That election wasn’t “fortified” in the sense we think of recent national elections. Rather, it was a close election like others we’ve had in which a Jewish vice-presidential candidate featured in the mix. His tribesmen consequently felt the need to let loose one of their their drama shows over the impossible situation they each faced in using a punch card ballot. You know, like blacks simply cannot figure out how to get a government ID, or how the poor innocent “dreamers” were dragged across the border against their will. It’s led to the current situation in which jurisdictions have spent profligately on electronic voting systems for which, if anythingissuspect, there can be no paper trail.

            I am tempted to think that revealing Biden to the world was a deep state scheme to remove him. But they could do that withoutFremdschämenand revealing how headless our federal government is.
So that leaves the improbable…there really are a bunch of people in Washington and Democratic voters in the hinterlands who convinced themselves that Biden is fine, despite evidence going back to 2016.

                I think some faction might want Chomo Joe gone and replaced, but I certainly do not think that the Gaystapo and the “intelligence” community or the Kagans running the State Department or any of the three letter agencies want a different President that actually functions. They are perfectly happy to run their little independent satrapies free from any Commander in Chief’s interference. Leonid Brezhnev was essentially in the same semi-catatonic state as Dementia Joe is now for seven years from 1975-1982, until he died, and the Soviet Apparat, especially Yuri Andropov, were perfectly content with that, because they got far more power and independent action with no chief executive in a system where there was no master, only a free for all of nominal equals playing politics behind the curtain.

                America is a country of believers. The “racist liberal” faction of our team, Spencer and Sailer et al., has until today been personally offended by normal people’s contention that Biden is demented/retarded. Did the debate change their minds? It was on tv—accompanied by depressed Democrat commentary—so I assume it did. Permission to notice Biden is finally granted. (They’ll still demand that if you claim he’s not functionally the president, you must name precisely who’s in charge. And when you do, they’ll ignore you and demand it of somebody else.)I don’t know how doctors diagnose dementia, but by a layman’s understanding of the symptoms—confusion, sudden rages, weird lies, etc.—Biden has been an exemplary case since the mid ’80s, and even before then we thought he was an idiot puppet. What’s changed is that his mouth disobeys him (that stutter he always bravely overcame!), he got some discount plastic surgery that makes him look like grandpa in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and he moves like a guy who’s about to die. That didn’t changeyesterday.

                    My poor aunt was 82 when she died, with small flashes of confusion and moments when she couldn’t remember just why she’d come to a particular place. Turned out she was having mini-strokes, but we didn’t know that at the time. Still, my sister was freaking out about what looked like the onset of Alzheimer’s, and researching care facilities.  At Auntie’s lowest, she didn’t look or sound like Biden does today.  Normal people KNOW when a person is losing it, and the alarm bells go off long before the patient is in Biden’s state.  I think that so many people have abandoned the mainstream news, far fewer people have actually SEEN Biden than would have been the case in the 1990s, when TV news was king.  I’ll bet last night was a real shock to many people who thought they had a feisty old grampa as President, and now realize he’s more like an incoherent Skid Row derelict.

        Agree that Sailer’s rehabilitation is the Left setting up a new dance partner. Naturally, that shows that the Right has no power nor has it had any real power for a long time.The Left (run by you know who) has realized that the old Right is so discredited and disliked by Normies (thanks Trump) that it’s no longer viable in its role as the Washington Generals of politics.Sailer, Rufo, MacIntyre are more believable, but just as ineffective. They notice race. They notice that whites are discriminated against. They notice that the white working class is in serious trouble. Given that this was never allowed to be discussed before, naturally, Normies cheer them on and flock to their side. Credibility.But these guys are all colorblind CivNats, so their solution isn’t whites thinking of themselves as a group and organizing as a group – something that the Kosher Left fears the most. Nope, these guys advocate that everyone should just stop playing the identity politics games and that the govt and businesses stop with DEI and using race.And given that the Jews have now realized that they’re going to be on Team Whitey whether they want it or not, it’s now best to go back to a colorblind system. Basically, the system remains in place except a bit less emphasis on identity politics in the media, academia and businesses but still allowing groups (except whites) to organize and fight for their own.Race aware but colorblind CivNats are the new fake opponent, and they’re perfect because they don’t want to change the system outside of a few tweaks like toning down DEI. They also never question which group is the real ruling elite or how they gained and maintain power.That’s why Sailer is being rehabilitated.

            It is also a signal to blacks (along with the Jamaal Bowman primary) that they better get with the Zionist program. Getting rid of DEI would be bad enough, but getting rid of Affirmative Action altogether would mean the end of the black middle and professional classes.

            I think it’s too late for that (and for right-ish commentary to change anything or anyone).
The big switch has been flipped. American Jews nowdemand—rather than conspire—to be excluded from whiteness.Anti-whiteness is America 2’s founding principle, and it must be preserved. And it’s white men’s favoriteRepublicans—Desantis, Abbott, maybe even near-future Trump—who are making it happen, for an extra frisson of humiliation.
Analogously, Sailer et al.maybe assigned to plump for “MENA”—Hanania isn’tyou, is he?—as a sort of racial rectification of names. Do we care? Does anyone? Does opiniondoanything?

        As bad as Biden was, Trump debated like a confident fifth grader. I wonder how Trump fanboys would feel this morning if he had a real opponent, with real debating skills, and not the hacks in the e-GOP, not Hillary, and not Dementia Joe – twice.
Whoever is allowed to win, the establishment/deep state/regime will let the years of mismanagement come home to roost and one of our turkey-necked presidents will be left holding the bag, the unpopularity, and the infamy.
It’s like geriatric Alien vs. Predator. Whoever wins, we all lose.

            If you expect Trump to attract anymore voters to his standard, that’s all he’s going to get away with.
His base of support has seen him at rallies and speeches and events and interviews. They are perfectly well aware that he could tie this or any other clown up in knots. The low information voters still thinking that he is an agent of chaos and that Pedo Pete should be the default option are too soft and stupid to be able to take anything other than “kinder, gentler” Trump.

                That’s likely true, especially for a populist “right-winger”. Though I think the Dems have been looking for a sassy POC; someone who is good on their feet and charming on the late-night shows without rustling the Regime. If they ever find one, and the right is stuck with a Mike Pence type, then it’s gonna be a bad time for us.

        Never underestimate the power of television melodramas.  The Eichmann show trial and Roots caused more mental retardation in the boomers than lead ever did.
If that generation had instead been subjected to something positive  (think The Greatest Story Never Told or a soap opera in which a young German girl in Weimar escapes from Magnus Hirschfeld’s dungeon) we would not be arguing about the JQ.  We would be instead arguing over the best way to update the highspeed rail system on terraformed Mars.

        The comments here give me hope. Watching normies, NPCs, retards, and midwits (re: The American Populace circa 2024) on various forums, venues, chats, etc. are all just taking what they saw last night at face value.“OMG! Biden was terrible. We owned the libs!11! Who would vote for him? Even CNN was saying…” blah blahI found it both quaint and sad that anyone still believes this wasn’t planned WAY ahead of time. His handlers and the people that actually run the US Govt are not stupid. By putting him up there they forced the issue to have him replaced for a horse that can actually win the race. Or they are going to let Trump back in and collapse the house down around him via war with Russia and crushing recession. He isn’t bright enough either to not take the bait.You needn’t look further than the fact that nearly every lefty &amp; liberal website and ragimmediatelyhad a story ready to go about it within minutes after the debate. Almost like they all get their talking points from a central authority.When Tucker was still on Fox did any of you ever see the montages he would do every so often of EVERY single media organization using the exact same sentences &amp; phrases? What are the statistical odds of that? The lefty media whores take their orders from “someone”. Not sure who they are but I could hazard some guesses. Old money diaspora tribals who have been puppeting since at least WW1, Intel Agency Borg, small country in Middle East, combo of all? None of the above? Does it really matter?Not sure this is a question that will ever be answered.But the cynicism and skepticism in the comments here remind me that not everyone is an absolute f-cking retard that takes everything at face value. After Covid and the various absurdities of the past few years how youcouldtake anything at face value is the grand mystery but the vast majority do. NPCs and sheep as far as the eye can see. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

            It is depressing but it isn’t just people like us who should be cause for hope. From what I gather, the audience for last night’s kabuki extravaganza was down almost by 40 percent. Granted, even those dropping out largely are clueless about what is afoot, but indifference is a good sign. Most of them never will make the leap to active and open cynicism, of course, but indifference is an improvement and historically is the precursor to significant change. Anything will be too little, too late to matter, but Normie assisting our and his own destruction will help mitigate the cataclysm.

            Leave it to me to add a depressing caveat.  My neighbor (decent salt-of-the-earth type heritage American who can build/fix anything) and another friend (even older long-time prepper) were talking the other night and they remain convinced that when Trump wins in November he will save us all, amen.  I don’t even say anything any more (they know I don’t vote).

        Re Sailer, should we allow the Claremont Institute to be the dance partner for the Left? The point of Zero Seats for the Conservatives in the UK is to punish them for finking for generations, and to remove legitimacy from Labor. If it is just one party, with no opposition, then it really is just a Oligarchic Rule seen by all as illegitimate, and must rule totally by force.I don’t have an answer. The US is not the UK.It might (or might not) be more profitable for “us” however to shape that dance partner to be either nothing or someone a bit more aligned with our interests and reality.Sailer’s solution would have been fine in 1971. It cannot work now with a defacto permanent open borders, permanent minority status for Whites, permanent hatred for Whites and especially Straight White males, permanent hatred for straight White males by most White women, permanent Rainbow/Alphabet plus hatred and mobilization against Straight White men, and the massive Islam/Cartel/Chinese control of most of the nation.America does not exist, Sailer is just too unwilling to notice this. It is merely a former country that is a giant tax farm of White men with a coalition of people from the Global South who hate each other and hate us more. That is it.

            Replying to my own comment, it is I think important to understand who is rehabbing Sailer and why, and the power and the limits of that power by those doing the rehabbing.Bottom line, it is the Lomez and associated groups like the ad hoc group around Bill Ackman and others who are rehabbing Sailer.The reason is they are really, really scared. And throwing up both Trump and Sailer as their defense as they understand that the crocodile, having eaten most White dudes, are coming for them.There are two big events that scare them, and another just last weekend that re-inforces this fear. The first was the Hamas protests which quickly and predictably became a purge of any and all Jewish students in the elite and near elite universities. For example, the U Penn protest was led byEliana Atienza who is the daughter of a billionaire Philippines TV personality. What happened was that the CIA/Soros (more Alex than George these days) organized these people to push Jews out of the Universities.The second of course was the various Trump verdicts and how easily the law was twisted into a weapon to get people that elites do not like, instead of impartial Justice. What was done to Trump was inevitably going to be done to them. They know it.Pretty much every Jewish billionaire and millionaire knows that the Hamas mob, organized by Soros and the CIA, can and will come for them, both in a mob form and through lawfare as their wealth makes them a target for seizure and taking by those connected in the law. This is why Sailer notes that David, father to jurist Emily Bazelon, made a fortune selling off seized assets of the interned Nisei in 1942.On Sunday, this past weekend, there was a private, non publicized event at a Pico-Robertson synagogue about investing in Israel. Hamas / anti-fa protesters (were told about it by the CIA) and showed up in force to beat the people there, invade and trash the synagogue, and trash/loot surrounding businesses while the LAPD protected the Hamas protestors. Calls to Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom by attendees who know both personally and have donated to them went unanswered.These people with wealth, money, and power, more than anyone here will ever know, but far less than those like Larry Fink of Blackrock or Bob Iger of Disney, are scared and seeking protection. Having lost it from their Democratic Party they are seeking it with Trump, Sailer, and some sort of Civ Nat compromise.I think it will fail, utterly, as they are up against not just Soros (he is the modern day Glomar Explorer / Howard Hughes of the CIA, i.e. a cutout to outsource revolutions) but the CIA itself which is now largely Girl Bosses of Color intent on taking their stuff and purging them from society.I would not advocate getting too close or too visible to this effort, as it is merely painting a convenient target on their backs. It would have been excellent as late as 1984. It is now just far too late and only makes one visible to their sworn enemies.

        Ahhhhhhh….What a fine show, Z. I am about 5 years into my retirement… and I tell ya… I am just stuck in permanent holiday mode. I run around in sandals and shorts all summer long, and the only big thing in my life is staying off the computer/political/hysteria-du-jour stuff as much as possible. It was tough at first, going from being a working man to being a non-essential stubfart, actually. I am finally starting to achieve a sense of contentment and humility. It’s not like you have any choice, really. I like that there are still places where sensible men can have a sensible conversation without it turning into a pie fight with lunatics – in an age dedicated to eradicating such spaces.On the future of Auntie Semitism… I sure hope you are right about that. My thinking is that it will all depend on how bad things get while America reinvents itself around new, emerging realities. If we see a full blown Weimar America… oh boy… I would not want to be a jew in the midst of that. I am thinking the gloves will come off if things get that bad… and the hell of it is – they will deserve it.I am also concerned about Dissidence. It is going to go mainstream at some point, it will have no choice. What will that look like?Next week, don’t spend too much time on chores and working! I know how Grillers are held in low esteem among the Dissidents – but it is an excellent way for even the most pious of Dissidents to unwind and chill and recharge batteries. You will all need your batteries at full capacity when the inevitable happens… and something stupid this way comes…Have a great weekend you guys.

            Tucker is willing to go right up to certain lines . . . and then stops dead.  Sailer is a waste of space and time.  He has his acolytes to tell him how insightful he is, as they all congratulate him and each other on how clever and cutting edge they are.  Their multi-racial high IQ paradise can be located on the cloud next to the libertardian one.

                    You know, there’s a nice Tolkien style fantasy quest novel in this. The brave (and stupid) band of Hobbits travels through all these various mythical lands and eventually arrives at Mt. Reagan. Perhaps the Precious is the Ring of Color-Blind Civic Nationalism.

        I would be more sympathetic to the obvious elder abuse taking place before our eyes, but since this guy has been a crook, a grifter, a chomo, a thief, possibly a traitor, and an outrageously careless demagogue for his entire disastrous career, my attitude is that more career politicians should finish their days shitting themselves in public like this before being mercifully let away.

            I’m convinced that whoever is the next president will be the fall guy (or girl) for the Big Crash, a modern day Hoover. If it’s Trump, that will discredit “maga” and America First for a half century minimum, just as it took the GOP that long to recover from it that time.

                Highly probable.  Trump assumes office with no tools available to avoid the approaching calamity.  I’ve pointed out some of these issues previously so won’t repeat.  It may very well be the situation that we are simply switching captains on the Titanic *after* we hit the iceberg.

                    It’s inevitable, but it isn’t inevitable within the next four years. AINO could go on ticking another 15 years before the actual crash. There are plenty of geriatrics in the power structure who’d just assume try to leg it out rather than suffer through totally unpredictable chaos.

                        There may be no “demarc” noticeable at that time. Ancient Rome still ran chariot races long after the final sack of Rome and into the early 500’s. The crash may just be an event “point” for future Chinese historians to argue about. 😉

        RegardingClaremont, I used to listen to their weekly roundtable podcast. I stopped after the October attacks on our greatest ally. These guys could give Ben Shapiro a run for his money as far as their pro-Israel bias. Plus, the roundtable was overpopulated by Tribe members and homosexuals. The ZMan is right. This is an obvious effort to take up the mantle dropped by National Review, along with the Lincoln Project. We shouldn’t buy it.

            I gave up on them earlier. I don’t remember why—some specific story triggered it—but it had become clear that their idea of what the news is, what’s worth discussing and the terms in which it can be “debated,” was bounded by regime/Democrat Twitter.Being Twitter-brained is common enough that it should be forgiven, sometimes, but they weren’t evennegativelyinfluenced by what “frogs” and “groypers” (who are almost all morons, but they’re popular right-wingers) were talking about. They had no idea.What I think happened: Claremont talked fairly positively about BAP once, without donor permission, and got slapped down for it. Since that day, they’ve stayed down. (This was years before BAP became slightly acceptable to some of “our” rich guys.)

                It would be surprising if Joe’s debate performance costs him more than a point or two in honest polls. Of course, in keeping with the planned nature of this, I expect there to be fake polls showing him taking a far worse hit.

        Democrats thought, after the State of the Union, that Biden was good to go. They said as much. Yet, as can happen, Biden has gone into steep decline since. His behavior in the past month was impossible to deny, although they tried. All the propaganda to convince us that he is totally engaged and sharp blew up in their face in the first ten minutes of the debate. I guess, on some level, they felt this was possible or bound to happen, but they also are people that believe they can create their own reality.I watched the whole thing. While it was great to watch the Democrat Party implode in real-time, I did not enjoy it. This man should be resting out his final days in one of his ill-gotten homes, not being paraded around by his Lady Macbeth wife as her and her faction desperately try to stay in power.

                The US died when Biden was installed. But yes, I support your sentiment. Last night’s abomination was just another slap of evidence for the legions of blockheads here and abroad who’ve been too bloody stupid to hoist in the obvious about this country.

Did you risk your life deep undercover as you unmasked his evul enterprises? Did you charge in, gubs a0blazing, as the cuffs were finally slapped on his wrists and he was exposed to the world as the slimy worm he was? Sprcifically what did you do? Hmmm?No? You didn’t doanyof those things? You amaze me! AND YET YOU RELISHED IN HIS DOWNFALL!!!??? Tsk tsk, Comspci! Don’t you know it is impossible to become a saint on another man’s sins?You are on this board talking about “AINO” all the time. But now you are suddenly, worfully humiliated by a debate thatw as acted out at the 4th grade level.See, that doesn’t bother me. Alrgough I don’t hang about talking about AINO morning, noon, and night, I actually have internalized that this copuntry is a hollow shell that does not respresent me, and that has been stolen from me before I was even born. Therefore I am not capable of feeling any shame when dirtbags like Joe Biden get up on stage and demonstrate what a total joke it all is.Less talling about AINO, and more exhibiting attitudes that demonstrate you actually believe that is the case.

You will know them by their fruit and his have been nothing but poison.
Not to mention if he ever had any sense of shame or embarrassment he wouldn’t have been a carny con-man his entire life. It’s like anthropomorphising a rabid and wild animal.

                        Biden is an old, demented man, who does not even know (I suspect) he is embarrassing himself.  We, if unlucky, will all reach a stage in life, perhaps of old age, before death where we are helpless in some aspects of life that we used to handle with aplomb.

            It’s a crisis of the middle. Maybe the crisis of the late Modern Age? Middle man lacks both a strong back and leadership/statesmanship skills. Managers developing AI, for instance, to do the managing. That won’t work, but it might be profitable.America moving towards aristocracy is interesting, because this country is built on the middle and Capitalism! It would be a difficult transition. Otoh, a culturally hierarchical place like Russia, which took it on the chin from Modernity, might have a much easier time. Maybe France, too, but they act like the swallowed the egalitarianism hook.I’d argue Yankeedom was heading in the direction of aristocracy, hence a developing high culture, but I guess the love of money took the Yankees in a different direction!Jews are the most middle of the middle, I think. Their predominance is as much structural as anything.

                Please excuse the rambling. Just throwing it out there.Aristocrat is allergic to work, but he loves warring and socializing. He doesn’t love money, but he needs it to maintain his lifestyle.Working man works because it’s his lot, which he grumbles about but accepts. He’s generally too busy making a living to make trouble, and as long as he feels he’s honestly getting by, he’s docile.Middle man can work extremely hard, but only if it means he doesn’t have to work down the road. He has greater contempt for the working man than the aristocrat, greater envy for the aristocrat than the working man. This is because he shares the aristocrat’s allergy to work, yet he’s not secure from working. He loves money because it’s his way out— he might even be able to buy his way into the aristocracy.That’s stating the obvious, but I’m an American. The middle man thing is the American Dream. You kind of take it for granted.

            Perhaps.  However, suppose the sane people left—evil as they are—simple pull those in influence aside and discuss their exposure to criminal prosecution for their decades of criminal abetting of the Biden crime “family”.  Suppose they discuss how, for the best of the country, such be swept aside *if* Biden steps down now and a sympathetic person assumes the Presidency.  Since we are no longer a country of laws, but one of rule of men, this should prove persuasive, and after all Biden is the only card they have to play everyone else being powerless.

        Several years ago Keith Woods made a good video documenting the machinations in Russia during and after the fall of the Soviet Union. It contains a montage of Boris Yeltsin staggering and falling in moments that require intense gravitas and solemn stoicism. He was paraded around.This was done by the same people who executed their color revolution in our former country. It seems that it isn’t enough to come in and take control of all of the resources of a country to extract its wealth and to take complete political power. They take great pleasure in appointing a broken fool to humiliate and send a message to the people they have conquered. They seem to revel in showing the people they conquer that they have broken there most powerful figurehead and will break us too.We must strengthen our resolve. I re-listened to ZMan’s manhood podcast. It is rich and full of sage advice. We must internalize that wisdom and be resolved to overcome despair by righteous and wise action. All is not lost and we haven’t hit bottom. But, it is within our considerable abilities to see that better days are made in our image and the image of our Gods. Answer yes through your deeds when you ask yourself, do I have the force of will to do my part to bring about the better times.God bless you all. Have a great weekend in preparation for our celebration of America’s Independence Day. They can’t take that accomplishment or our ability to celebrate it away from us.

        The problem with “preppers” is they turn it into a lifestyle and gadget hobby.  The average prepper has 19 ways to start a fire in the woods (there is a big overlap with “bushcraft”)  There is a big “prepper community” on youtube and it primarily revolves around gadgets and lifestyle.  There are probably more knife and flashlight reviews on youtube than you could watch in a lifetime.  Most of this is sponsored without disclosure.Of course, they are all also “sponsored” by people shilling extremely overpriced terrible food nobody wants to eat that supposedly is good for 10 years.  Of course, if nothing happens, the purchaser will never know and if something truly awful happens where you need years and years of food storage, well, the courts won’t be operating anyway.Keeping a rotation of food you like in your basement that doesn’t require a ton of water or energy to prepare it is not a bad idea.  But it should be of food you eat on a regular basis.  It should be rotated so that it doesn’t go bad.A lot of people buy a generator, put gas in it to break it in and then shut it off.  If they get a power outage, they’re gonna be pissed when it won’t start.  They don’t know you have to drain it.  Modern gas simply cannot be stored for more than 12 months, often less.  The ethanol sucks water in from the atmosphere and then it sinks to the bottom and rots the gas tank and the bowl and the jets.  A generator large enough to power your home for even 2 weeks is going to require a lot of gas.  You’ll easily go through 5 gallons a day.  70 gallons of gas is a lot of gas to transport and store and continuously rotate to prevent it going bad. Even when in an airtight container (which you should never store gas in), the gas will break down and turn to varnish.

                Toilet-paper, whiskey and ammunition.  That’s about all the prepping one needs.
Speaking of which, I was in line at the grocery store yesterday and the lady in front of me bought a couple bags worth of groceries – – – and one roll of toilet paper.  One roll.  I cannot conceive the logic.
That’s nuts.  The store sells a jumbo pack that I always urge my wife to get.

                    You’re obsessing over toilet paper, which humans have survived without for millenia, but made no mention of food. You got the whiskey and ammo right, but neither are of much use if you die of starvation. P.S. Neither is the toilet paper.

                            It’s an American thing, and a rich man’s game at that.  Hygiene here, and most of the Western world, is quite high I judge. (Apologies to the Japanese and Koreans)I can remember as a child the “Saturday night bath”.  That was it.  Hell, even old apartments had a communal toilet/bath at the end of the hallway.  Yes, I saw that too.  Tooth brushing was gaining ground, but my father had to have all his teeth pulled and dentures when he arrived in the US due to no such practice (tooth brushing) in the old country.And if you say “What’s with TP?”, I say you are correct.  Bidets are making inroads.  😉

                    Zulu.  Sound’s crazy to me as well—-but I’ve been in stores and some people are indeed that poor.  They cannot afford to buy even the slightest amount over immediate needs.  I’ve seen an item left at the register after the customer lost an argument on the day’s sale price having expired—and no, it wasn’t a spiteful act, there was no money in the purse!
Perhaps it could be as simple, and pitiful, as that?

            Instead of watching ‘prepper’ flashlight reviews, simply focus on being more self-reliant when global/national/community systems breakdown.  Prepper and homesteading videos can be helpful with discount codes for various products. As far as energy goes, solar systems are still extremely costly and a huge part of that is the installation, for those of us with minimal electrical knowledge.  Same for solar ‘generators’ (battery/invertor combos), although having some of those and some solar panels is a good way to start.No one ought to use standard ethanol gasoline in ANY equipment outside of a modern vehicle – certainly not in any generator.  One can store quantities of non-ethanol gasoline for a few years if treated with Pri-G – in 5 gallon cans or 50 gallon barrels, or larger tanks (all depending on space and finances).  That fuel will be useful for chainsaws, mowers, non-diesel tractors, generators, etc.  Better yet is a propane generator and propane tank(s).  Best is a combo of propane generator for limited daylight use and recharging of solar generators.Some of us use only limited canned food on a daily basis, so storing lots of cans takes up a lot of space and weight for limited calories.  Having some excess of basics (flour/cornmeal/rice/pasta/beans/sugar/salt/spices) put aside is a cheap and easy insurance policy.  Home-canned or freeze-dried sources of protein are a further insurance policy, depending on one’s skills and budget.  Heck, buy a few large jars of protein powder and peanut butter powder.It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.  The focus doesn’t need to be surviving a nuclear apocalypse, just being prepared to provide one’s own basic services when possible.

                Sure, I agree with a lot of this, but when it comes to food, I really think you need to store food that doesn’t require a lot of water and energy to prepare. A kerosene “mop stove” is probably the best cooking option.More importantly, it should be food you know and like.  If a badly timed snow storm shuts society down for a few days you have the regular stuff you like.  But a true grid down or something where you need long term food, like say 3 months or more will be incredibly stressful.  The last thing you want in such a situation is an entirely new diet of foods you’re not used to eating.Generating electricity for more than a couple weeks just isn’t viable except solar. Solar will give you a lot less than the nominal value of all your solar panels, but what it can provide it will provide for the duration.  If I were going to use generators, I would own the smallest Honda money can buy and then a larger one with a few kw. Generally speaking, the larger the generator, the less efficient it will be with small loads (BSFC), which would likely be most of them.

        &gt;The people humiliating this man by parading him around should be shot.This is where I have been since 2020.In this instance “the people” are the entirety of the Green Zone and its hyrda heads: all former and sitting members of Congress who remained silent, the lice infesting the Executive, the JCS, AIPAC, the media, the bankers, the 7th floor of the Hoover building, and the heads of the spook agencies, past and present.  All have been engaged in this crime against the nation.They should not be shot but hanged, but only after being subjected to televised interrogation (enhanced, of course) to establish their guilt.  They may be criminal thugs, but we are the just and patriotic citizens whom they have betrayed with their treason.  After this their corpses should displayed outisde their repsective offices until picked clean by our feathered friends.  Meanwhile, their families should be stripped of their citizenship and property, and then deported.

        Apparently. I am known to the host only as “that guy who shows up in the comments who hates Steve Sailer with the intensity of a thousand suns.” This is not quite true, but there are some interesting things that need to be mentioned in connection with this.In the Steve Sailer portion of the show, Z averred that Steve was a nice guy who had been treated unfairly by the establishment. This is inconsistent with the analysis he gave in the Ukraine Kooks portion of the show, of which Steve Sailer was one. In that portion, he talked about how vicious and condescending the Ukraine and Covid believing bloggers were to those who disagreed with them.Steve Sailer was incredibly insulting to many of his commenters who turned out to be right about Ukraine and Covid. Z-Man gave an interesting analysis of this phenomenon which I think is largely correct, but it happens to bethe same analysis that I wrote three years agoandrepeated in more detail 1.2 years ago.If anyone thinks that Z-Man is right today, then you must also admit that I was right years earlier. Please think about this before acceding to the canard that I “have no idea what I’m talking about.”

            Before you blessed us (?) with your presence, the Covid scamdemic was discussed extensively on this blog—and with the exception of one commenter, recognized for what it was within a few short weeks.  Z-man and the group was correct.Your comments wrt HBD, example “The only people interested in HBD are a small and strange subset of internet cranks,…”still remain little more than ignorant, gratuitous assertions—obviously based upon your association of such with, and hatred of, a single individual.  Z-man was also correct here when he compared your knowledge of subject matter to that of a ‘freshman’s understanding after taking an initial survey course’.And yes, the above illustrates that you have no idea of what you are talking about as well as no idea of your use of logical fallacy of your commentary.  You are a walking contradiction, but even a broken watch is correct twice a day.

        Thank you for answering the question posed yesterday. Enjoy cutting logs, mowing fields, and doing all of the things that must constantly be done to hold nature at bay. It will be good for your health.The insider tip on what is happening with Sailer is a good one. I think that bringing him back can only bring about a higher potential for positive change. With the Con Inc of the 60s and on there was a lot of headroom and a massive buffer to chew up between dispossession and how far it gnawed through that buffer. I don’t think the existential threat is breathing down everyone’s neck. Everyone can now see their children and the world they inhabit.The Caldwell, Rufo, Carl, Claremont attempt to slay the Civil Rights dragon is I believe a sincere fight. It is going to hit against The Regime’s race communism racial patronage network. Its most belligerent and ethno-narcissistic client groups are going to smash the illusion of colorblindness for everyone as they react to any hint of dissolving the CR regime. I think Gregory Hood said it best. The Rufo/Claremont attempt to provide an off-ramp for The Regime’s racial caste system is the system’s final chance to rid itself of death by bitter and vicious racial strife that becomes more overt by the day.Their attempt better be sincere and it better get results in short order. Rufo’s Pyrhhic victories of the black sinecure’s, “scalp”, is pathetic. She still gets paid $900K a year in her other Harvard sinecure and Harvard’s iconoclasm and continued anti-Occident militancy has gone completely unpunished. History may show that Rufo was just a guy who paved the way for a real scalp taker and that his role was to teach a real group of legitimate scalp takers how to operate.One last thought on Sailer’s resurrection is that we don’t know how organized a counter-revolutionary anti-CR regime is. It could be well planned that he is the palatable first salvo – the first sortie in a wave of serious offensive actions in a legitimately waged war. The point about Frodi is relevant here. Frodi is a good guy, but he is entrenched in how wronged he and his people have been by The Regime. That is legitimate and understandable. Would it be optimal if we could do the needful the right and expedient way to right the many wrongs we have suffered and do it right away? Yes. But we can’t do that – not yet. So Frodi has a blindspot there with Russia. All that means is on Russia he isn’t someone who we should listen to. Still, he serves his role and people with a wider perspective will come to us through him. This is how these things work. One guy lights some fires but isn’t up to being the man who leads the band of men gathered around the bigger fire to plan and win the battles ahead. If he leads to that guy or one of the Aldermen at the big fire ten years from now, he served his purpose.Same with Sailer. Our side tends to always say – “This is just controlled opposition! He is there to let off steam.” Maybe. Let’s see. There is someone who was mentioned in the comments today who I can tell you on authority appears to be that guy but is intentionally placed at the top of the funnel and has a prominent voice. I can tell you he isn’t controlled opposition. He is strategically placed along a specific funnel to get our people from the top to a full and proper understanding and posture of why we are where we are at and who is who. This is why IRL activity is so important. IRL can lead to clarification.I am rooting for whoever is bringing out Sailer. If the CR regime is rolled back and done so legitimately in practice, not as a PR stunt, then that is a huge win for us. If the battle is waged sincerely but lost by the Claremonters, then it further unmasks The Regime, delegitimizes them and the way will be cleared for harder men with more resolve to get results.Happy Independence Day

        Trump was presidential as fuck last night. He was stoic, didn’t lose his temper, whipped out a few good zingers on Biden like the golf swing remark. Then when biden got flustered trying to respond, Trump’s reply “lets not act like children here,” made him seem like the adult in the room. I give Trump an 8 out of 10 score.

        Regarding the uselessness of hbd folks and paleocons, I disagree that they’re useless because they offer no plan of action. They are useful in bringing others over to this side. Reading hbd and paleo stuff brought me over.Stupid as most of the hbd people were during the Plague, their other work remains valuable. It was also useful to see how people who should have known better — after all, they supposedly knew some biology — could be so utterly clueless about something biological. Figuring out how that can happen is a worthwhile endeavor. Maybe the answer is that the WuFlu response was strictly political but that still fails to explain why the seemingly-based hbd people were taken in.

        Statler and WaldorfPair of Muppet charactersStatler and Waldorf are a pair of Muppet characters from the sketch comedy television series The Muppet Show, best known for their cantankerous opinions and shared penchant for heckling. I envision 2 senile septuagenarian/octogenarians in wheelchairs shouting, trying to hit each other with their canes. Both were embarrassing and I see no good outcome for our country at all

        I find it really hard to believe that the left finds Steve Sailer to be an acceptable “dance partner” or “relief valve.” if HBD ever took hold in Normie world, it would be the end of most of the left’s agenda. Most of liberalism is built on white guilt, and white guilt goes away if you can find another explanation for the current state of affairs besides racism. And if you can talk openly about it the way Steve does, all the charges of racism become like BB’s hitting a battleship.

            “If HBD ever took hold in Normie world, it would be the end of most of the left’s agenda.”This is not at all true. Every normie in the country could become an HBD believer tomorrow morning, and the Left could carry on with exactly the same agenda without missing a beat. HBD could be spun as an ironcladreasonto continue on with Affirmative Action and special treatment for blacks, because “after all, they’re genetically disadvantaged and cannot be expected to compete on a level playing field.”This is just one of the many, many reasons why HBD should be abandoned and repudiated as an utter waste of time. It is not only scientifically absurd, but also politically useless.

                “It is not only scientifically absurd”You were doing really well up to right here. This is why nobody listens to you Professor. You can mouth all the platitudes, and use your expansive lexicon, your egregious exacerbating mentally masturbating ivory tower dwelling pseudo-intellectual vocabulary. But you never leave the campus, do you?You have absolutely NO real world experience rubbing elbows with diversity where HBD would immediately become “scientifically credible” in a way that would make you sh-t your bloomers.Most fascinatingly, I agree with your basic premise. HBD would changenothingbecause religion is based on faith, not facts. Whatever you tell them, they will spin it in support of their god, DEI. But you lose the plot entirely with your absurd civnat takes. You are Sailer’s mirror image which is why I think you have such an unquenchable desire / hard-on for him. He is everything you wanted to be, but you never made out of the community college circuit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                    Well said.  I’d add that understanding of current HBD science—which ID has *none*—would/could improve race relations in spite of DIE concerns.First, HBD understanding will indicate that there is only so far one can go in elevating humanity to equality.  You can credential a White and a minority equally, but the White (on average) will outperform the minority and this will *not* be because of external factors.  This undermines DIE.Second, HBD understanding will go a long way to understanding different racial behavioral proclivities (similar to our current acceptance of disease susceptibility between the races), and therefore provide a rationale basis for understanding cultural differences and the folly of mixing the races.  Another DIE underpinning.Third, and probably the most important, HBD understanding will provide a basis for the problem of IKAGO, and show that this is the basis for a major fallacy of reasoning with regard to the entire underpinning of DIE.  When we talk of what to do with races—or any population—we always talk of the average and the distribution of that average.  Sailor gets that (if I understand from others) only half right as he excludes behavioral aspect of genetics and the concept of regression to the mean).

                    Thank you for agreeing with the basic premise.You do realize, of course, that my actual life bears no resemblance to whatever it is you’re imagining, don’t you? I think even you realize that at some level, so this act of making up stories about me to suit your preferences is very unhealthy. Do you think if you clobber some avatar of me online (that you invented yourself), that you’ve accomplished something? Try listening to the actual argument.Like most commenters here, like Z-Man himself, you’re engaged in playing motte-and-bailey when you try to defend HBD. You’re putting forth an easily defensible claim and pretending that it stands in for a much more dubious one.HBD is not reducible to any set of sociological data points. HBD is not reducible to a general statement that a lot of black people be bad dudes. I don’t think you’ll get any pushback from anybody on that. HBD involves the specific contention that black people areevolutionarily and biologicallydifferent from white people in a manner that makes them unsuited for modern society. This latter claim is unprovable because it is simply wrong; but whenever you’re challenged in the bailey, you retreat to the motte of “blacks be bad dudes.”If Darwinian evolution isn’t real (and it isn’t), then the whole premise of HBD simply falls apart. All I have tried to do (for many years now) is to point out that you can still be a race realist without being a biological reductionist, but idiot HBDers don’t seem to realize when somebody is doing them a favor. They would rather hitch their wagon to the fading star of 19th century materialist-atheist metaphysics. Well, feel free to go down with that ship, but don’t say you weren’t warned when you find out nobody cares about that.

                        ID, you are an ignorant ass. You continue to make assertions without citation. All your assertions are refuted through published research. When you say, “If Darwinian evolution isn’t real (and it isn’t),…”. You reveal yourself to be living in another world. One of your own imagination, ignorance, and prejudice. Darwinian evolution is perhaps to *most* widely recognized theory in the biological sciences we have. However, HBD science does not require Darwinian evolution theory since we are now able through genome analysis to prove human differences and trace heritability across generations.Too bad your recent commentary will not be read by most in this group given your late posting. Folks then might do the sensible thing and ignore your insanity rather than feed it through thoughtful response.

            Interesting.  After the 2008 economic debacle and the beginning of the “Great Recession”, analysis of home loan defaults showed one major reason were the loans being given out to those minorities—and others—who had no business being home owners.  The percentages were pretty stark IIR.  This was in part due to the government delusion that subsidizing a larger proportion of minorities (first-time) home owners would make them more solid, upstanding, and bill paying citizens.  Something along the lines of the “magic dirt” theory.  Clown world part two.

        Trump beats Biden by a fairly small margin in the polls (after 3 1/2 years of Biden’s train wreck presidency). Replacing Biden with a non-cognitively impaired candidate would likely secure another eight years for the Dems. Trump inspires loyalty among most Republican voters, loathing among most Democrats, and insufficient support among independents to make him the shoo-in a Republican candidate should be after the last four years of Biden’s misrule.

            The “Football”, or alternatively the “red button” on the desk is wildly exaggerated.  The President cannot start a nuclear conflict on a whim, or by accident.  The authorization for such indeed comes from the highest office but that’s after the military asks for such permission.  The President of course can be an idiot and drive a smallish conflict into a larger,  nuclear one—as Biden seems to be doing now in Ukraine—but he just can’t arbitrarily nuke someone.

                News to me, Compsci. How do you know that? How do you know that the Commander in Chief does not have complete control of the military?
There would only be seconds, minutes to respond to a nuke attack. The delay in going through channels would be critical. The war would be over already.

                        Lots of gray area here.What if an ally is nuked? What if an overseas American nuked? Would that be a matter of responding or initiating? No time to be dilly dallying.

                        Correct. In the case of a response, for example if the President and civilian command structure was eliminated, the military keeps *two* generals in the air all the time who will direct retaliations. This can be Googled, it is no secret as it is a deterrent to be known to all the world’s nuke powers.Russians have something similar to prevent a decapitation strike, but even more scary. They have a “dead man” switch in which the command structure must answer a “are you there request” from the automated missile system. If no response, they fire off. This is from Scott Ritter who worked in this field for many years.As to whether a president has complete control over the *initiation* of a nuke war irrespective of first or immediately pending first strike. I doubt it. It has not been US doctrine to initiate a first nuke strike, and as near as I can tell that’s not changed. Therefore we have a deterrent “triad” of land, sea, air retaliation built to *receive* and *survive* a first strike with the capability to wipe out any offending nation. I do admit however, much other than our sea carried Tridents look weak and vulnerable, but just one Trident carrying sub can wipe out all of Russia. We have 12, the British 2.Now imagine that, tomorrow, Biden in some fashion convinces the military attaché standing behind him to hand him the “football” so he can type in the codes—which he also doesn’t know. Would he do it? Would those codes be acted upon by the chain of command at a high level knowing the situation currently is at Defcon 5, or 4, or even 3? Why have those levels at all? Well to prepare the military for action and to gin up support/preparation for a military response. A doddering old demented man does not gin up support from the military.The real problem/threat here is with tactical nukes and the possibility of escalation from field use to general population destruction, in which case all bets are off.

        “He is an old man who should be waiting for the sweet relief of death right now.”It looks like Parkinson’s to me. Based on my Dad’s progression, he is years away from death, probably a decade or more. The dopamine drugs gradually lose effectiveness and they increase them until they start hallucinating, then they start balancing that with anti-halucinigenics. The dementia progresses pretty slowly and he actually seems to still have a grasp of reality: he could still grasp the topic being discussed, his brain is just processing slower than it should (not that his brain was a particularly fast one to begin with). In fact, I don’t think they would have to suddenly flip the narrative him just yet.

        One of the reason’s Sailer has been let back into the fold is because American’s even a solid percentage of democrats are experiencing black fatigue and Sailer is an HBD powerhouse who can be used to open the door on the black problem, without being too much of a shock to the system. Sailer as Z mentioned on the show is not a radical or offensive figure and is not likely to be a lightning rod for pushback the way a Jared Taylor or Matt Walsh would be. I think many main stream Republicans are finally finding enough backbone to kill DEI. I can’t see anyone calling Sailer a Hitler or a Nazi being taken seriously, because he’s a mild mannered, professorial Civ Nat.

            I was told by my well digger (45 years experience) that everyone who gets a manual water pump regrets it.  Apparently, it takes forever to manually pump a small amount of water.  Also, they cost over $1k.  He recommended a simple bailer bucket to bring up about 2 1/2 gal (around $150 and you can make your own pretty easily).  I have no personal experience as yet.  Just relaying what I was told.

                I was told by mine (family in the area and business for decades) the same thing.  Not to mention our well is quite deep.  He was also disparaging of solar well pumps, for what it’s worth, although I’ve seen some online ‘homesteading’ channels that seem to use them successfully.My one other suggestion/option he wholeheartedly endorsed:  buying and burying a large water tank (I want the plastic one with internal supports to keep it stable and non-buoyant – like these –https://www.infiltratorwater.com/products/infiltrator-tanks/water-tanks/im-series-potable-water-tanks/) and have the deep well pump to fill up the tank.  Then use a hand pump or smaller and cheaper on-demand electric pump to use that water.  Minimizes use of and stress on the main deep well pump.  It’s on our wish list.

                There’s a hand dug well on the family farm, probably 60-75 feet deep, so not terribly deep. It’s got a hand pump on it that’s at least a century old. Speaking from experience, it is work to pump, but not outrageous. I’d estimate you can pump a couple of gallons a minute, so a few minutes’ pumping will get you a day’s worth of water. Not a big deal.
If your well is a couple hundred feet deep, yeah, that’s a heavy column of water to push, but I’d imagine modern pumps are more efficient.

        Finally listened to the show. Re: making short videos—A few of my friends are big YouTubers (Japanese “vtubers” mostly) and they think that short videos, whether song-length or actual #shorts, bring them nothing but “dead subs,” subscribers who never watch anything they post. Some of them have corporate incentives to accumulate subscribers, and some think that making that number go up is helpful with “the algorithm,” but they all agree that those new people rarely become new fans. On Rumble the frequent-ten-minute-video strategy seems to still work (as it used to on YouTube, until Brexit+Trump made them wreck everything). Everywhere else, no use.

        My view is that both Z-Man and the commentators here are by a custom of habit, long time beliefs, upbringing, are simply unable to internalize emotionally what they know intellectually. Voting does not matter.If voting does not matter, what difference does it make, per Hillary, if Biden is a senile dementia patient. Real power, flows not directly from the barrel of a gun but from the bureaucratic control of an organization that has the monopoly of men with guns. See Stalin victorious over Trotsky, because Stalin was the better bureaucratic organizer. That is the case here. The real power does not need to have elections. If they want, and they want for sadism’s sake, they can push your nose in it and make you see what you did wrong.Biden repeatedly talked of Nato’s Article 5. Which requires every NATO member to come to the defense of a member attacked. So the plan by the bureaucrats in the CIA/State/Kagans-Nuland plus Obama is for US boots on the ground in massive numbers by August/September. With a draft to fill in with the casualties predicted to be 50,000 every two weeks. There is no way with voting that this can be sustainable so the model is Zelensky. Emergency Rule forever.These people have a well thought out plan. Have Trump jailed July 11, stripped of Secret Service protection and Epsteined very quickly. Even Ace of Normies commentors know this to be the plan.After that, “Biden” issues an emergency declaration, in conjunction with either Ukraine being made a NATO member or some incident real or imaginary, cancels all elections, and puts the nation under direct White House (meaning CIA/State/Kagan/Obama) rule. He appears by AI hologram occasionally, and your nose is rubbed in it.A good part of the desire for this is the innate sadism and hatred for Normie by Obama and his CIA people. I could smell them initially when they appeared on the scene as I had some experience with minor versions of them in my personal life.Their lives are so empty and barren of normal human feeling, behaviors, and pleasures: a beer with a barbecue, enjoying the beauty of the natural world and its plants and animals, joy in simple gathering of family and friends, that only the most perverse and sadistic things make them feel anything.I don’t think Biden will be kicked off the ballot. Instead I think we will see the Zelensky solution writ large in the US. With people in vans grabbing White guys off the street for the Draft, and more. One man, one vote, one time.

        The assertion that individual or group preferences are their own justification and should therefore be respected by others with a different will or preference is insupportable. Upon such a foundation all dependent moral claims become baseless and uninteresting.

            Well, that’s largely the poststructuralist position now, isn’t it? And I must say, they’re basically right about this. It’s the only thing they’re right about, of course.

                I wish I could respond directly but I’ve read very little of either structuralist or poststructuralist philosophy. Anyone can see with their own eyes the fruits of tolerating minority preferences though. When you fail to assert and defend your own preferences sufficiently you will certainly have someone else’s imposed on you. Free association and free speech were only adopted as moral skin suits by hostile aliens until they were sufficiently powerful to refuse them to the host nation that they infiltrated.

                    Agreed. But what I’m noting is that group moral claims are valid within their own moral systems, and that moral systems are coterminous with groups. The pomos use this argument to justify multiculti–after all if moral claims and indeed cultures are relative, all are equal, and we therefore have no standing to oppose mass immigration. I would argue, on the other hand, that although there is precious little to unite groups and serve as the basis for evaluating crosscutting moral claims, each group nevertheless has the right to reject other groups simply because they prefer their own people and culture.
