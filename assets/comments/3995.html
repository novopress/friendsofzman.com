        Fashion is the end point, or last gasp, of most consumer goods. Remember back in the 70s when car companies were introducing the Pierre Cardin Edition? Etc. Even AMC got into the act with a Levi branded denim Gremlin.Remember when eye glasses were sold based on price and appearance? Not designer.All that said, Apple has been pretty successful at merging form and function. I’m not sure how successful the watch will be. It seems to me, and I wear a watch every day, an idea in search of a problem to solve.But then, I’ve been waiting for my Dick Tracy wrist radio since 1963.Will there ever be an Apple Magnetic Sky Car?

            There is a piece of the Apple Watch puzzle I’m missing. From what I read the big utility is the fitness apps. That’s what Apple is pushing. The trouble is you can get a product that does all those things for $100. There are tons of them on the market. They are water resistant and durable, two things the Apple Watch is not. Since most Apple people look rather nonathletic to me, I’m thinking maybe by “health apps” they mean something else. Even so, the thing only works in conjunction with the iPhone. Otherwise, it is just a watch.I’m thinking that Apple is out of ideas for consumer electronics so they are just hoping to sell accessory items for a while to buy time. They will sell a bunch of these to their fan boys. The entertainment rackets will go in for the diamond encrusted models as a statement piece. It’s incremental revenue for Apple. Meanwhile, they scan the horizon for an idea to pilfer and turn into their next big thing.

        I admit Apple gear is the best out there – especially their software ecosystem – but I too am wondering why I should start wearing a watch again …
It would have to be the HealthKit apps and the body sensors. I think the home control stuff will work at least as well, probably better on the phone.
God knows I don’t need to be any more accessible.I certainly don’t want spending my money to be any easier.
Apparently I’m just not young enough to need more eye sparkles.

            The thing that makes the Apple Watch even nuttier is it only works with an iphone. If you have your phone, what do you need the watch for?

        Off topic, could you please add your unz comment feed to the blogroll on the right, maybe even above “A-List Fans”, i mean this:
http://www.unz.com/comments/commenter/The+Z+Blog/
It makes for good additional reading, but not everyone knows about it.
You also mentioned there that you listen to a few podcasts, care to share which?
My personal favorites are the Adam Carolla show, radio Derb &amp; Age of Treason (because you got to spice it up every so often).

        Worth remembering that just about everything we have and rely on was invented or made useful between about 1850 and 1950. In that era we got radio, TV, the phone, the internal combustion engine and a whole lot more, including nuclear energy.All we have done since, more or less, is to refine it all. Wi-Fi is merely radio, the latest must-have fast car is just a car in a different shape shell, and so on.Oh, I know there are a few things, such as fibre optics that weren’t invented in the 100 year window I am talking about, but essentially most of them were known or being worked on back then. In this case then, all companies like Apple are doing is marketing their ideas to hold a decent share of the money available for what we already know.A personal time piece attached to the body? Sounds like a new idea to me…
