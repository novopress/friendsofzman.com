        On the upside, this event is probably the single best thing that could have happened for Trump’s reelection. The 2020 election will be a single-issue election and immigration will be all that matters. The President of Mexico is openly advocating for an open border with the US, and the Democratic Party will hold exactly the same position. #winningIf Trump manages to serve an 8 year term he could easily appoint 5 or 6 Justices on the Supreme Court. Ginsberg is 85 and riddled with cancer. She might make it through the next two years, but not another six. Breyer is almost 80, but that bastard might live forever. Hopefully Thomas and Alito will have the good sense to step down while Trump is in office. In a perfect world this could be a 7-2 Court.

            Ginsberg isn’t riddled with cancer. Her tumor was tiny and picked up on a scan that was done for other purposes. She’s one of those rare cures of pancreatic cancer.
That said, I’ve seen others that were apparent cures get recurrences before, but she is being followed very carefully with the best scanners on the planet.

                Am I wrong to think that if she was on the other side of the political fence, the scanners might not be quite so state of the art or so rigorously monitored?

        This time won’t be different. Here’s the tell:“Nationalize oil industry.”Venezuela is not exactly next-door, but it’s pretty close geographically, and a lot closer culturally and politically. Mexicans have no excuse for not observing and understanding, except one: they’re not capable of it. They’re like the teenagers who hear screams in the old haunted house and decide to go inside and take a look. Everyone knows what happens next, but they’re going to do it anyway.And you’re right about war, though you’re the first person I’ve read who actually says it. Obrador has out-and-out declared that the U.S. border doesn’t exist, and he intends to use the North as his bitch. That’s not going to play well in the American heartland.

            The oil industry in Mexico has been nationalized since the 30s. What the previous president did was to admit that there was no expertise to increase production unless foreign investment was allowed. Mexicans took this as an affront to their sovereignty, which is something that the gringo is not allowed to have. Foreign investors also didn’t take kindly to using it as a slush fund.

                It’s that reform that Obrador wants to do away with. But not only that, he wants to spend billions of dollars building new refineries — without foreign investment — when the refineries Mexico already has are notoriously inefficient and poorly-run. In essence, he’s doubling down on what had already proven to be a losing hand. Without foreign investment, Mexico will have to eat the entire cost of trying to reform an energy sector that is corrupt and incompetent. They’ve already proven they’re not capable of running their oil industry, and the fact that voters take offense at reality isn’t going to change reality.Obrador is delusional, and he’s going to run the energy sector into the ground.

            Not for nothing – but we’ve got an awful lot of white faces running around in THIS country waving flags with hammer and sickles on them and voting for Bernie while yelling about “Democratic socialism!!!”
Seems we have quite a bit of the same thing going on right here.

                The overeducated/indebted urbanite is never going to have the same perspective as the rural property owner that our system is based on.  It is entirely reasonable to allow the major metro areas to become either their own states or federal districts like DC but with only 1 senator. Possibly they could even become independent countries like Singapore.

            Venezuela is the obvious path Mexico is taking, though her low IQ population is too short-sighted and greedy for gibs to realize it. I don’t see how open war with the US is in the cards by any measure; their military is useless, they don’t go to war with anyone, including their drug cartels. Their military and police institutions are corrupt to the core, preventing organized tactical and strategic victories. What is likely is the Ameri-Mex slow, steady annexing of border regions as Amlo declared openly. That is already happening. Their long game is to populate the southern region with their peeps, and have been enormously successful so far. I can see some form of actual annexing if the US was preoccupied or otherwise weakened with a World War. As all countries do, they will claim discrimination against their people, and move in to “protect” them, crossing the border and occupying it similar to what Israel has done with the Golan. They will de facto control the southwest. That’s the Aztlan goal, to recover the territories they lost to the US. They never gave up  that goal; it is in their blood.

        When I start my car, the stereo automatically starts playing the audio from the last phone app I was listening to.   I often think about a bunch of normies or my parents getting in my car and suddenly hearing something like this from Z’s recent podcast.  “The fact is, without white people, black athletes would be throwing rocks at animals, hoping to catch a meal.”If you carpool with people from the office, that line just got you fired.Or can you imagine Z being booked (by mistake) as one of the guests on a Sunday morning political roundtable?  And he slips in the above line.   There’d be an earthquake.   Picturing these scenarios reminds you how far removed society has come from saying simple, true things.   Anyway, it would be hilarious.

            Africa could on its own manage a late iron age maybe early modern culture. They make interesting and sophisticated weapons in many areas of that continent and have decent metal work and craft skillsModernity seems a lot less likely without help though if you put all the Ibo and the like into a country or two  with rich resources , while you wouldn’t get Wakanda , you might get a prosperous modern nation till the neighbors killed them off.problem is not that there are no smart Africans,  they exist and I’ve met some. Problem is proportions, too many 2 digit IQ, poor impulse control people and mot enough smarties to help

                LineIn.  I’ll put it this way, the first I ever heard about Taneshi Coates was years ago, when I received a thick envelope in the mail from my dad.  It was Coates’ famous essay from The Atlantic.  He’d written at the top, “MUST READ!  THIS GUY GETS IT EXACTLY RIGHT!   IT’S WHAT I’VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT AMERICA FOR YEARS!”  Since I was a teenager he’s made me sit through Mississippi Burning no less than 50 times.  My mom is from the South so she’s more realistic.  But yeah, I don’t discuss my Alt Right identity with my family.  It’s not worth the hardship and they’d never understand anyway.  I do speak in race realism terms to them.  Always have.  My dad is just clueless and for some reason thinks I’d be into Coates despite everything I’ve ever said to him.  He’s obsessed with racism.When you say “renounced”, do you mean your family member won’t even talk to you?

                    That’s tough with your dad, although I imagine it would be interesting to discover why he is “obsessed with racism.“  I agree it’s best to say nothing and enjoy what you can in the relationship.
For years one of my siblings and I had avoided talking politics to one another but I messed up. I said that if I had been around in the 1950s during integration that I would have opposed it.  I apologized for bringing up controversial politics but the damage was done and that sibling won’t speak to me anymore.

            The wife and I took our last trip to Mexico in December. It was my third trip there, and her first.  When we got home, she said the same thing I always hear from first time visitors………. “How can a country with so many resources be so F’d up and so poor?”  Stay on the resorts, take a bus tour somewhere…….like Tulum maybe……and have a good look out the bus windows on the way. Then come back home and cross Mexico off the list.  If you need a refresher course,  visit California.

        The original ‘Let Africa Sink” essay by Kim Du Toit.
http://www.kimdutoit.com/2017/05/05/let-africa-sink/#more-1592
It’s how I’ve come to view the entire Third World.  They could prosper – Argentina and Venezuela were once relatively rich countries.  But they decline every chance they are given.  They always chose socialism and corruption.  Wall it off, return to pre-1965 immigration policies, and let Mexico, Africa, Central America, and the rest figure it out themselves.

            Socialism and Big Men seem natural to them- isn’t there a way to harness or instututionalize this without the turmoil?
For cripes sakes, Western kings were the guys who could bring the country’s worst killers to their banner.  We civilized, why can’t the rest?

        In the AmRen podcast “A Mexican Reflects on Mexico”  Jared Taylor’s guest asserts that the politicians and police in Mexico serve at the pleasure of the cartels, which suggests that there is no peaceful solution to Mexico’s (and our) problem.

            How many white people take drugs?If the Devil can entice people into evil deeds – then the Devil wins.  Even God can’t seem to get rid of the Devil – so the common refrain out of Christianity it seems has been to try to teach people why they shouldn’t fall victim to the devil’s charms.If all the white people in the US stopped using drugs – how big would the cartels be? How much power would they have?We’ve been going back and forth on this drug shit for as long as I can remember – long than I have been alive.In the end – my way of looking at the issue is that it’s an arm movement problem.  The drugs don’t inject themselves. The drugs don’t smoke themselves.  The drugs don’t get swallowed without having first been placed into your mouth.  If all those people who are doing drugs – and therefore are supporting the cartels – simply said:  “I’m a lazy shit – and I’m not even going to move my arms today”  –  that would at least be one day when that person wasn’t taking drugs.Once you start to look at it that way – the Islamic practice of cutting your hand off for stealing starts to make sense.  No hands = no theft.We have a culture where it seems nothing is ever the “victim’s ” fault.  As far as I am concerned that is an anti-white culture.  This country used to have a culture VERY centered around personal responsibility.  I’m mostly English-Scottish – and that’s where that culture came from.  I haven’t found too many other cultures – even “white” cultures – that had the same level of personal accountability that the Anglo-Saxon (Puritan) culture had.Socialism is a invention of the white man.  Maybe it works when you’ve got a cohesive “tribe” (like maybe the Swedes) – but it sure as shit doesn’t work with third worlders.  And importing a bunch of socialist minded people into an individualist – high trust – high personal responsibility culture like we USED to have here – quite obviously is not working.As far as I’m concerned the only thing that is going to solve the drug problem – and by extension of that the cartel problem – is a pretty severe imposition of “personal responsibility” thru any means possible.  Stop funding rehab thru government taxation, stop all the sympathy – make people pay for their choices. I mean REALLY pay.It’s going to mean people  dying.  Of that I am sure.  But if genetics and population adaptation to conditions are to mean anything  – they maybe we’re at the point where the addiction gene needs to get wiped from the map.  It’s easy – because people will self select for elimination.When all they had to do to stay here – was stop moving their damn arms around

                The drugs were legal for nearly 400 years per the DEA study (a book) done for Nixon.(Actually, for all of history.  The Chinese went after the flood of untaxed opium from the Raj’s Pakistan, opium was legal until Mao seized control of it to create the original Golden Triangle in Vietnam.  Taft, Governor of the Phillipines and later President, had shown the effectiveness of making it illegal in poor Philipines and used the profits to buy up hundreds of Asian businesses, rail lines, shippers warehouses, and land.  HSBC, like it’s imitator BCCI, was created to handle the money flows.  And yes, (((You Know Who))) controlled the industry from it’s inception under Sasoon of India.)We used to let consequences occur when soda jerks made low dosage tinctures and tonics at the pharmacy.  Common sense comes pretty easily to a free white population.  Prescription is there for a reason.The government started the illegal drug industry for small reasons (keep the under-the-table money flowing after the Prohibition payoffs were lost to Constitutional law ruling)- but drug money quickly bought off every dictator and corruptocrat in the world.Drug money leverage lifts all the asset classes of the 1% and now has bought the 11th richest country in the world, Mexico.What, do people think these things are done because politicians LOVE us?Illegal drugs took off.  Dumbasses say, “well they’d just find something else”, except they didn’t for thousands of years.That’s why I’m on the fence about Cartel AMLO coming out in the open.  If this government industry gets mainstreamed, will it mitigate the gangs- make them just another division of Big Pharma, selling useless eaters New and Improved Skullbustium!- or is criminal government simply announcing itself, like the Soviet regime?

                    All true though back when drugs were legal, most people were farmers and society was massively  less complex . No on in an SUV was going to drive over my passenger car or into my house at 80Complexity is killing us anyway and we won’t survive it since it appears technological society creates an atomized population and such a population won’t reproduceThough counter intuitive antibiotics are far more of a public health threat than legal drugs are anyway and we aren’t going to regulate them.The ugly truth is US society is imploding , its like the USSR post Chernobyl , too big, poorly run, too corrupt and ungovernable

It’s just easier for you to bang on whites because it’s PC to do so.

                    Using drugs is in nearly all cases a choice . In any case common sense says when a rival or enemy is weak, profit off them. Its how people work.The US is weak, no one is in charge and its logical and rational to do so,The US has no friends, its an empire after all and so everyone wants a bit of our liver,What we need is a Caesar with full control of the military and militia and a willingness to  to expel people and   kill till order is maintained .I don’t see us getting one or getting control of the militia who while well intended are men with no stomach to rule even if that feckless attitude damns us all.Rule or be Ruled, that is the iron law

Which has destroyed white communities and families across the country.Our business community did it, they are also the ones who imported all those illegals.You want to make a man feel useless, take away his hope for ever climbing up the ladder. Make him a loser in the eyes of his family that he can’t provide for anymore or maybe the best gig he can get is a shit job at a big box store with no bennies. Give all the good jobs and scholarships to nasty foreigners who hate whitey’s guts.Lets not forget the Sackler family that is dumping mass quantities of Oxy across the country to get people addicted on purpose.Lastly, so you want to get on your knees for a tyrant to save you and yours, eh.?

Government love drugs, the more use the better. It creates more criminals, justifies a police state and for those not lawbreaking tales away the incentive to fix the thing
The problem with drugs is while they numb the pain they also break the will. People getting high are too busy doing that to punish the people who sold them down the river.
Hell they rarely bother to vote and while voting is often, not always (c.f President Trump) a scam, its a necessary prelude before you can declare exterminatus

Everything is always somebody else’s fault.You said rule or be ruled – that is the iron law.You are correct.  You either rule OVER YOURSELF – or you will be ruled over by somebody else.When you can’t stop your own damn arm from sticking a needle into your other arm – then you are VOTING to be ruled over.  And when you vote to be ruled over – you are also losing any choice over who will do the ruling.Since the cloud class seems to think that dindus and hispanics … and I guess trannies and gays and women – should be your new overlords………  somebody please explain to me how the abdication of personal responsibility and assignment of responsibility to the cloud class – is going to get resolved in the favor of white people?You guys have lost the civilizational script  – you need to get your shit together.

                            For as long as I’ve been alive, so-called conservatives have been preaching the gospel of individualism. After every defeat, after every concession, they start in with the mantra of personal responsibility and individualism. After nearly fifty years of watching this, I’ve concluded that individualism is subversive poison. If tribalism and collective effort was OK with Ben Franklin, it will work just fine for the modern honkey.

                    The beaners know how to handle addicts too. If an addict proves troublesome, he gets thrown in the can for 90 days. No safe injections, no programs, no intervention. If he survives the involuntary detox, he leaves prison clean. If he dies – meh. Who cares if an idiot insists on killing himself with drugs?Duterte in the Philippines is doing great with his war on drugs. You deal that crap, you get killed.

                        The US in not the Philippines and a huge chunk of our White drug problem is legal drugs.That said, unless we close the borders and regulate the hell out of the economy and divorce, we won’t be able to get a handle on dope. Rod1963 is correct in that the unstable conditions are a huge cause of the drug use. Its the same reason drugs were everywhere in the late 19th and very early 20th. Conditions were  shit.My feeling here is  if we have a near dictator like Duerte we’d be better off using those powers to bring the corporates to heel rather than beating up poor peopleForce order where the chaos is causing the most harm and that is not the ghetto, its the boardroomsCorporations  will learn to operate to some degree for  the national  good and if they don’t will be arrested.Try capital flight and a Letter of marque and Reprisal is written and you and maybe yours  get whacked by the CIA , some mercs or  anyone who feels like itIts all nice and legal too.After we’ve fixed economics and divorce, than we can start tuning up dopers if we need to.

                    Where did I say I didn’t think blacks and mexicans aren’t massive users of illegal drugs?  Some of you guys seem to have severe reading comprehension issues – as soon as somebody starts infringing on the blame the darkies and blame the burrito eaters blame train – you lose your shit.The point here is that the white man didn’t conquer the world and get Western civilization to where it is (was?) – by lying around in a drug induced coma.  As I’ve seen people point out a number of times (including here I think) – the great cathedrals didn’t get built with slaves or with a bunch of drunks or people high on hash.If you think the white man is somehow going to stop what’s going on – it’s NOT going to happen without some reformation of “white” culture – which USED TO mean not being a useless piece of shit who sits around taking drugs all the time.  That’s what Mexicans and blacks are for – and it’s exactly why there used to be what we call today “rampant racism”.I just spent a couple of days down in rural Kentucky.  Pretty much every guy I talked to related some story about how there’s a huge drug problem in the area.  They said there’s actually lots of jobs at $15-$20 an hour – but nobody can pass the damn drug tests.  And these were all white guys talking about friends and family. I didn’t see too many black faces or hispanic faces in the area either.  This was white man country.So go ahead – keep bitching about the dindus and taco brothers – the problem is within your control – and you’re choosing to ignore it.If the white man can’t get his shit together – then somebody else (immigrants) – are going to take his shit from him.  That’s just a simple fact.

                        Before drug testing- an insurance scam started by that high-function, addictive psychotic Bill Bennett- people with bad habits did the work, and built those fricking factories.Work was what cured or tempered those bad habits, just as weed used to be a common remedy for alcoholism.We’ve “managed risk” to the point of replacing the Dirts- which has now become the plan by sanctimonious hypocrites.As if the Bennetts and Weinsteins are without fault.Drug testing will end illegal drugs!It will make society better, shiny, new, free of sin!They’ve elected a new people.The low dregs who built this civilization just weren’t good enough.Now meth has become our black market economy.  It shouldn’t have started in the first place.

                A great many, if the obituaries in my local paper are any indication.  Yet I also see “off the books” hiring by employers that used to employ recent HS grads and teenagers.  I also see scholarships handed out to anyone other than “whitey” by local colleges filling “diversity quotas.  The truth is that one can live in the land made prosperous by our ancestors and be discriminated against in favor of the recently arrived.  And if you advocate for them–for your own progeny–you’re labelled a “white supremacist.”

        At one of the dissident right meet ups in the past couple of hears there was a Mexican Nationalist who said that NAFTA had really hurt farming in Mexico, because they had to compete with subsidized agricultural goods from the US in their own markets. Interesting that instead of  getting rid of NAFTA, the response of the new president of Mexico is to subsidize farming.I’d like to say a few things about the post yesterday since I was so late to the party that they wouldn’t get read.In the argument of city vs rural, the one thing that was overlooked is the fact that surrounding countrysides no longer feed cities. The supply chains are not only very tight, but are spread out even internationally. If it hits the fan there will be mass starvation in the cities, and there is no way to stop that even with military requisitioning. The military will have enough to worry about feeding itself, and they will have trouble keeping enough truckers willing to drive convoys into hostile cities.If you live in a city or suburb and cannot afford a bugout location of your own: 1. Never tell anyone you have stores of food and water. 2. Try and get in with family or friends that have rural connections at some place at least an hour away from the city. You don’t want to be within walking distance. Another good option would be to get together with some like minded people and buy a bugiut location with a water supply like a well or pond and stock it up. Call it a hunt club and run it as a nonprofit corporation. You will not need a great deal of land. The main thing is to survive one winter.One other possibility is that the cities pacify themselves. Most people realize that radicals are basically criminals with political goals. One result of SHTF could be to turn hundreds of thousands of fence sitters into middle american radicals, MAR’s. One thing all the leftist propaganda and the conservative reaction to it has done is to obscure the fact that the French Revolution was largely a middle class affair with the middle class making a series of alliances with nobility and sans cullotte in order to maintain power. In September 1792, when war with the royalist allies was breaking out a spontaneous uprising occurred in Paris where the prisons were invaded and vigilante courts were held and thousands of prisoners were summarily executed and thrown into mass graves. This was the middle class purging the city of dangerous elements prior to having to go to war.In the situation we will be looking at winter or invasion from the south will be our war. Protecting and feeding families will be the priority. I think we pretty well know that radicals are better eaten than listened to. And the average Joe will come to that conclusion right quick, too.

            By radicals, do you mean SJWs?  They are just the contemporary iteration of religious zealots.  They have no coherent worldly aspirations.

            Spent the weekend in Hemet, CA, a middle class/lower middle class suburb of L.A. with lots of various vibrancies.  If the SHTF, there will be no pacification.  The police there are hardly holding a lid on things as it is, speaking with them and some community members at the local emergency room.  The frequent Saturday night gunshots we heard are called the “Saturday night fireworks” by the locals.  If things get rough, you need to be as far away from these places as possible, with a place to go to.  This place is going to be Hell if things go sideways.  The locals are going to hop in their cars and just start driving to get away.  And this is considered a somewhat nicer, whiter suburb, not too far from upscale Orange County.

            That was my understanding with farming in Mexico.  NAFTA killed agriculture which caused a wave of rural peasants to the north looking for work.  I wonder how much of that also provided a nice pool of cannon fodder for the cartels?
BTW, I always like the argument of how good of workers they are and yet they somehow can’t create decent countries of their own.

                Cartel fired the peasants and hired military professionals.  The abandoned los manyas turned to waves of kidnapping and robbery.  Their heads wouldn’t end up in an ice chest so long as they stayed away from Cartel business, drugs.
But who says Aztecs don’t have a sense of humor?  One guy, they parked his truck at the front door where his wife and kids would come out in the morning.His head was the truck’s new hood ornament!

            Ferfal, an Argentine survivalist who writes about their currency collapse in 2001, says  it’s safer to stay in the city.  Everyone thinks to head for the hills, where they are easy targets for roving banditos.
Nonetheless, I do have 10 acres of mountain forest land, lightly populated by kinfolk, in a resolutely diversity-free area.  I thought that being surrounded by hellraiser redneck hillbillies with guns might someday be a good idear.

        This ” Veteran Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ” is no such thing.   He’s a veteran communist when some of his first “thoughts” are nationalizing oil.   This guy has declared war on the US and I think it behooves us to take him at his word.  Build The Wall now!   Remove all illegal aliens now!   WE do not need to reform immigration.  We need to eliminate it and replace it with “Invitation”.   Nobody has the right to immigrate but we do have the right to invite people.

            I’ve thought for quite a while that the “system” we have in the United States is completely screwed up.  We allow millions of illegal immigrants into the US to “do the work Americans don’t want to do” (according to the immigration defenders).Why don’t they want to do the work?  Maybe it’s because we pay them to not want to do the work?  How many illegal immigrants would be fighting for a job – if ALL forms of welfare were eliminated and people were confronted with a ” work or don’t eat” choice?I’m guessing that millions of illegals would suddenly find themselves hounded out of jobs as the dindus found out the joys of work again.I believe another part of the problem is teenagers.  How many teenagers these days simply don’t have jobs at all because their parents want them to concentrate on their ‘studies’ ?  35 years ago when I was a teen –  the teenage work force was out there doing all sorts of work “Americans don’t want to do” .  Mowing lawns, humping concrete forms, working on farms – these were all : “see  you don’t want to do this for the rest of your life – now smarten up and work hard and get a better job” … type jobs.You could even attribute some of the infusion of illegals to the fact that so many Americans don’t want to mow their own damn lawns.  When I was a kid I don’t remember anybody who had a lawn service.  Now the things are everywhere – because nobody makes their teenage boys do it any more – and the fathers are busy watching football and playing video games.

                Part of their “doing the jobs Americans won’t do” is because the illegals will do the jobs for cash, no questions asked, at rates far below minimum wage and without all the withholdings and Social Security and so on.
I dream of the day when the California elites are required to pay a “living wage” for the servants and gardeners they need, to go on living as they do.  And also carry the responsibility of insuring the health of their employees, instead of threatening to “send them back” if they get a boo-boo.

I’ve seen people make the comment ” what do I have to do to give up my citizenship and become an illegal alien?”  quite a bit over the last ten years or so.

                It’s basically illegal in the United States to pay anyone under 14 years of age to do work, and yet few people seem to know this explicitly. Of those who do, most celebrate it as protecting the rights of children. Odd isn’t it?

                Damn, you are preaching to the choir. This weekend I dropped off a spare car seat to a friend of the family.  Her “boyfriend” was in the yard mowing the grass with a pushmower; it was over 90 degrees out. He’s 70, and still works 40+ hours a week loading trucks. Her kid is 21, lives in mommy’s basement and was naturally still fast asleep at 10 AM. He delivers pizza a couple of days a week, pays no rent, and does nothing to help out.  We don’t need more illegals, we need more fathers with balls.

        There are a lot of ways Mexico can try to re-take the SouthWest – their continued, never-ending goal – without resorting to open military conflict. The dream never died, it is always a flame in their hearts. It is part of the Plan Espiritual de Aztlán, and supported by the Mexican government, as you can see how ferociously they criticize the US when we talk about strong borders.. As they’ve already tried, they would like to revisit the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. As the population of Mexicans dominates the South and have close ties to their family and culture in Mexico, those folks are expected to vote in favor of open borders, softening the lines for eventual re-unification, if not outright pushing for it. No open military conflict will happen with Mexico unless the US is extremely weakened by some catastrophe like World War or civil war. Then Mexico would annex portions of the South ostensibly to protect her people from raciss whitey discrimination.

            Fred is a fascinating case because he always faced the unpleasant truths of life without flinching.  Then he moved to Mexico, married a Mexican, and suddenly HBD is a lie.  The power of p*ssy, I guess.

        All this discussion on the future of Mexico with AMLO…ain’t nuthin’ substantive gonna’ change.  The man said what he had to say to get elected, just like the gringo politicians north of the border.  He’s smart enough to know that if he did try to shake things up too much, he’d be quickly taking a dirt nap.  Please people, just remember…we’re talking about Mexico.

            If things get bad enough Trump could just stand aside and let the Texas National Guard deploy – or look the other way as “citizens” deploy themselves to the border.

        Suppose you are the leader of a country whose people are of modest human capital, like Mexico.  You love your people but recognize their limitations.  What is the best way to govern?

            Right now for Mexico does it matter if you don’t deal with the elephant in the room – the narco cartels?  Columbia beat them eventually with a lot of American help.
Until the cartels are dealt with, Mexico will be a festering shithole regardless of government policies.

            Karl;*And* that campaign is the obvious point of departure for planning how to respond to Amlo if he’s serious about the war he promised to bring to us.  Geography doesn’t change.Thing is, he’s a genius communist of sorts in that he promised his voters that he’d get them free ‘stuff’ by looting a neighbor’s capitalists instead of their own.  Now, one may ask how that plan differs from that of Aleric the Visigoth, who is pictured at the masthead.IF he’s serious and IF we had a serious elite, pre-emptive/preventative war would be on the table for discussion *right now*.  I seem to remember the Neocons being on the preventative war side of the discussion regards W’s Excellent  Iraqi Adventure, when the issue actually didn’t matter so much to our own national security.

        Another way this Mexico election helps:  Now we have another argument for fence-sitters on the immigration debate — “Why do we want to import socialist voters?  Don’t we have enough of them already?”
Another random musing:  Argentina underachieves.  They should be better governed than they are.  At one time they were a wealthy country.

            I’ve never been to Argentina, though have thought about it often as a place to start again. It seems to have so much … yet does so little with it.   Why? Argentinians are mostly genetically European – Southern European with a large admixture of Italians. I suppose, as a country, it’s doing no better or worse than Italy. Reversion to the mean, and all that  …But it also has a good number of Germans. The old “magic dirt” thesis, turned inside-out, may be in play here: you can bring good genes, but if the dirt is bad, nothing grows.http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/12/how-argentina-became-white/

                    The Argentine population is almost completely European, so it’s perennial weakness can be separated from low IQ, leaving only it’s Spanish inheritances of culture through language and religion to blame. So far as I know. Add low IQ to that inheritance and we explain most of Latin America.

                        Many Argentines are mestizos, so the average IQ of 93 is on a par with southern Italy, which is also a mess. So it’s not culture, most of the world has that clan oriented culture.

                If you only tour downtown Buenos Aires, you will come away with the impression that it is mostly a Spanish/Italian country.  In the BA suburbs and beyond, La Argentina is mestizo and indio.  The statistics may merely reflect that the criollos in BA care not a whit about the rest of the population.

        Perhaps 40% or 45% of Americans will support closing the border with a nutty Marxist who hates America as president of Mexico. But what about the nutty American Marxists who hate America? Yes, they’re perhaps only 5% or 10% of the population. But they control the opinion-shaping institutions and they have a lot of fellow travelers.

        With Argentina, it is not the ‘Latin Way’ but the ‘White Southern European way’. Peron was Spanish and French Basque (100% White European). Argentina is much more whiter than Chile yet Chile is first world and Argentina is a shithole. Not as big a shithole as say Guetamala but a basketcase nonetheless.The reason why Argentina is the way it is, is the mass immigration of Eastern and Southern Europeans who with very rare exceptions like the Czech Republic and Slovakia have a piss poor track record of building a successful modern country. In a similar way America’s fate was sealed once the WASPs and Nordics were pushed to minority status by the 1880-1920 immigration tidal wave.America needs to return to a pre-1865 immigration policy not a pre-1965 one. The post 1965 wave was far less destructive than the 1880-1920 wave.

        Has anyone heard of the Plan of San Diego?  Regarding Mexican reconquest of the Southwest, this ambition of theirs is not make believe and has a storied history.  The Plan was a conspiracy of Mexican nationals in the Southwest, in the early twentieth century round 1910 I believe, communicated via newsletters circulated from San Diego for a militant recapture of the lower Southwest.  They intended to kill all males 16 and over and enslave the females and younger males!  I think there were even some skirmishes and deaths involved.  I have a book about it which I have not yet read.  Historians go back and forth over the seriousness of the conspiracy, with leftists arguing that it was only hypothetical fantasy, of course.

            Taking control of Mexico would be a monumental nightmare. The violent, low-IQ population would never end their natural ways and could never be controlled, and never assimilated. The only way it would work is if the US did what they did in the country’s early years: to genocide the native population to the point of no return. That simply isn’t going to happen for many reasons.

        “Now, America has a failed narco-state on its southern border, thanks to the greed heads we politely call globalists.”
Add to that a failing, America loathing, welfare-state on your northern border. Great times, great neighbours. Sorry.

        Funny, a guy in another string/site asked me what it was like in Atlanta. My answer? It’s overrun with landscapers (i.e. Mexicans and I didn’t have to spell it out) I know one very well. He subleased space in my shop for several years. When I first met him, his “Get To Know You” statement was .. “I love to Dig a hole an’ Plant a Plant” OK, that’s simple enough. He and his female companion were honest and friendly. They were also getting more loans and health care than I could imagine possible. They make great money. I do not. It’s funny when you like someone who’s in your parameter and don’t realize they know more than you about how to game things. I still have no Ill feeling toward them. They are IMO, good people. Multiplied by many, perhaps not. It gets confusing when you’re well behind in a political game and just reacting to life.

            Well said.  One expects things to go like one was taught in elementary school.  Then as an adult you realize the game is actually dishonest and against your middle class ass.  This hit me hard when I was in the emergency room.  The head accountant lady was grilling me about payment and insurance while I was laying fucked up on a gurney in the hallway.  I could barely talk and couldn’t open my eyes.  Meanwhile the Mexican dude on the gurney next to me never got hassled.  And I’m pretty sure he never got a $3,000+ bill in the mail like I did.  It pays not to have an address.  Fuck this country.

            That’s just it- they are for the most part very good people, not inclined to riot or jihad.
And boy, they can game things.  White Dirts just don’t seem to have that clever “gaming thingie” in them like non-whites do.
Maybe in part because the Nons aren’t spending all their time trying to reform each other, they simply accept it and get on with things.

        Moving both borders north would seem the best way to prevent a ruinous continental war.  The Queen’s not in a position to protest much, either.
