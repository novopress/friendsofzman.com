        I was brought up CofE but now that I live in the USA, I have attended my local Episcopal church. Not any more. In 2016, Brexit was denounced from the pulpit because it was based on racism. The rector didn’t have much of a clue about the issues, but that didn’t stop him. The new rector came in now sermons are more like CNN newscasts that anything else. His own personal Twitter account supports every liberal cause, and then some. Jesus is pushed to the peripheries. I was castigated for taking my own 1662 version of the BCP and told to conform. I’m done with it. I now listen to services on the web (for as long as they last) and read my KJV. I just wish that I could find a traditional church in my area but there doesn’t seem to be any. God Bless.

        The weird thing is, the more the church tries to be ‘progressive’ the more it alienates traditional church-goers, but the gaps in the congregation aren’t filled by the progressives, who would rather celebrate a mosque being opened than a church being maintained. Even if the mosque steadfastly refuses to officiate gay weddings (which the church is accepting), the progs want Islam to succeed more. Like I say, weird.

            I think the issue is that much of what defines Progressivism is a reaction to traditional western liberalism. That means they will side with the Muslims in tearing down the church, even though they know the Muslims plan to kill them next. Like libertarianism, Progressivism does not work outside the lab. The internal contradictions become impossible to tolerate.

                Further evidence, I guess, that progressives only exist for today. Despite all their fine-sounding rhetoric, they can only see the immediate ‘must do now’ and eschew any long term view. The Muslims however will wait their turn.

        The Episcopal Church is the remnant of a dead empire, or a department of the British government, the Chirch of England, which has been pretty anemic ever since most of its clergy fled the country during and after the revolution, having sworn an oath of allegiance as they had at the time of their ordination, always in England of course, since there were no Anglican bishops in the colonies to do it here. They have never recovered, which is why the USA has barely more Anglicans tha Canada, a country with only 10% the population. This is also why the Methodist Churches are five times the size of the Episcopalians here, if not in The UK, where most Methodists are Welsh, even if Methodism was founded by an Anglican priest, Wesley. Today of course they are getting power-slammed by “modernism”, as the Catholic Society of Pope Pius X puts it, or the schismatic traditionalists who fetishized the Oath Against Modernism devised by their namesake to combat innovations in doctrine.

        “…you cannot be both a Progressive and a Christian, without compromising on one or the other.”And there it is.  The key demarcation for this time in our nation’s history, and the harbinger of the Apocalyse.  A Democratic vote is a rejection of God and 2000 years of religious principles, and kudos to whatever hardy soul is the first to stand up and speak it plainly.  So far Franklin Graham has come the closest, and he’s been vilified from all points on the political spectrum for actually refusing to compromise his spiritual integrity.This isn’t just a fight for the soul of America, this is freakin’ Armageddon.

            Roman Catholicism is headed down the drain with the Episcopalians for exactly the same reasons. The process accelerated when the Curia kicked out a theologian Pope and replaced him with a left wing political hack.

                What really ruined the Catholic Church was the Vatican II in the 1960s, it made Cathocism more like Protestantism.

                    I agree about Vatican II, having been an adolescent in a Catholic family at the time. It was clear that the outfit claiming to have codified universal and eternal truths was starting to change its mind about some of them.

        “The only folks holding out are the geezers who do so out of habit.”
Or, literally, for the sake of their funeral.  Honestly, I’ve read and heard from old people whose viewpoint is that circumscribed:  they don’t really care what’s going on in the church.  All they’re thinking about is the nice funeral they’ll have in the pretty surroundings that have been familiar to them for so many years.

        I grew up in the Episcopal Church (born ’51). The division between progressives and conservatives started coming to a head in the early 60s when the Left took power and sued (successfully) to take the property away from the conservative parishes.  It was shameful. they even took over a beautiful monastery in the mountains overlooking Santa Barbra (where I went on a number of retreats) and turned it into a homosexual den of vipers.I left my beliefs pretty much in the late ’60s and came back thru (ironically) thru Protestant evangelicalism and joined the Anglican Catholic Church (ACC, and “catholic” as in not Roman). The ACC is aligned with African bishops who have really led the charge, worldwide, against the gaystapo. We use the Book of Common Prayer (1921) and the old hymnal.
