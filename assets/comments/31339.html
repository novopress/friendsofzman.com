        I have to disagree. The media has done the one thing I thought they would never do, and that was to create another Trump, and to do it in the very same way. When they remove Trump from the race for the nomination that will leave only Ramaswamy who the media has given all the free airtime on the debate floor to make himself the new Trump, or at least a mini-Trump. All the Republicans to the left of Ramaswamy, and that will be all of them, will split the moderate vote and Ramaswamy, the new Trump, will win the Republican nomination.

        Y’all need to watch Javier Milei in an interview where he’s not being “on” for the cameras. The guy is a serious economist (that’s actually his expertise) and seriously anti-woke directly because of the societal effects.
If he fails, it’s not because he’s a clown, it’s because Argentina has its own deep state and a huge system of bribery that will be majorly unhappy at being cut down to size. Pretty much the Trump problem.

        Re Argentina:  That is not so much a prediction, as it is just laying out its normal cycle.

        § If, somehow, DJT gets back on all ballots and wins in November, he’ll be arrested before the EC’s votes are counted in January. This will instigate an “insurrection” to be blamed on DJT, and it will be cited as justification to nullify his EC votes. As during the campaign throughout October, reruns of his “dictator” remark will pour out of TV, radio, and Internet 24 × 7 in scary ads warning the public that Hitler is back for the umpteenth time.§ A new variant of the Covid-19 virus will be announced. We’ll know that it’s the deadliest ever, because models. Covidians in big ciites, on college campuses, and in so-called blue states restore compulsory masking and “vaccination”.§ The October Surprise is unplanned: A European American son or daughter of a prominent Democrat is killed with intense cruelty by an immivader. The press fails to cover it up. Leading members of the family denounce the immigration mafia as murderers. Many Republicans dismiss the killing as an own goal, but the event breaks Democratic unity. Within two weeks, the Internet is flooded with details about election rigging which could be known only by insiders. Every D election victory since 2016 is called into doubt even on CNN. Trump calls for militias to find and destroy Democrats and Republican connivers. Death squads of various racial and religious factions begin operating in cities and suburbs. The American Enterprise Institute and American Coservative Union call for Congressional hearings with experts on violence.§ Just kidding about white libwits and Democrats snitching on each other. They turn a blind eye to the killing. The real October Surprise is an alleged recording of a phone call between Trump and Sean Hannity about plans to be a dictator on days two and three. The death squads, however, will be real. Most are comprised of niggers, and not just those who’ve been operating as robbery gangs for years in cities such as Chicago. A few wetbacks and sons of wetbacks are involved. White gun nuts are inspired to buy more ammo and to put holes in paper targets with pictures of George Soros and Islamic terrorists on them. The ACU, AEI, Cato, Heritage, etc. publish a flood of papers calling for tax cuts, the elimination of “red tape”, and more “tools” for police to fight “anti-Semitism”.

        Watching memes on wrsa I had the thought that 2024 is the year when general white awareness rises. That is, whites in general understand that it is exactly a concerted effort to genocide us out of existence. This could be the game changer

            By summer, several weeks before the first convention of the Uniparty, mudshark ads will virtually disappear. People who point out this coincidentally timed change will be denounced with the usual claptrap. The mudshark ads will reappear around Thanksgiving, and again noticers wil  be told that they are racists who are just imagining things.

                The racism scam has hit diminishing returns. Soon it will hit catastrophe theory which is a mathematical theory that models “one small step, one giant change” phenomena. The jig is up

                    Thanks for reference to catastrophe theory. Probably ruling and managerial classes have PhD candidates and poast docs working on models to identify critical values where their schemes blow up. Goal is to learn optimal moment to relax their hand. Imagine them combining this with fractal analysis in an AI system. It will make them even more dangerous, like any bad actor wbo can practice virtue of the self-correction habitually and accurately.

        My predictions, bear in mind I am by nature a contrarian and that colors my thinking so I could be wrong (its why I am DR) are driven by the five forces I see:1. The rise and aggression of the War Karens.2. The Soros-Biden Civil War.3. The Military and suppliers having buyer’s remorse over Biden and likely secret Trump-Military deals.4. Raw ambition among younger White male Republicans who see no future (for them) in a majority-non White nation run by Biden and the War Karens.5. Putin and Xi wanting Trump rather than Biden, viewing Trump as predictable and able to strike and keep deals, with Biden weak and likely to give into Soros and betray any deal made.The first is likely to drive events internally. Every War Karen Secretary of State wants to lecture the deplorables on how awful they are and how the War Karens need to micro-manage every aspect of their life. That Maine Secretary of State is going to have imitators in nearly every state, seeking fame and fame-whoring likes on social media. And the innate female desire to War Karen. This will run into the last force, which is the ambition of every younger White male Republican. Sure, Kevin McCarthy, human-turtle hybrid Mitch McConnell, and Miss Lindsay are set. But what about the up and comers? They want/need jobs in a Trump Admin, and if War Karens can get rid of Trump they can get rid of them in favor of some diverse candidate. So the idea of brushback, not just with Biden but with other Dems is going to be irresistible which  means that War Karening is going to be a huge mess of mutually assured cancel culture in ballot appearances. Which means political chaos, not just in the Presidential ballots but for both parties having their leading candidates canceled on the ballot by War Karens and the desire of White Male Republicans to avoid working for a living if they don’t push back doing the same. The Supremes will have to get involved and smack down the War Karens who will go on the warpath afterwards led by Fauxcohantas or Liawatha, Elizabeth Warren.The Soros-Biden Civil War will intensify, with Biden now showing signs of cracking down seeing the danger. Soros ran that playbook with BLM, nearly having a mob storming the White House to remove Trump in 2020 as I predicted. Only using Federal Law Enforcement saved the day as the military finked on Trump. Those White House employees protesting in front of the White House, the Soros organized invasion in Philly of the DNC meeting, was to use the weapon on Biden to make him dump Israel (among other things). Reparations are part of that demand as well. Finally the NYPD shut down the Palestinians at JFK today, as the word came down. But Soros has escalated that into an anti Jerry Seinfeld jihad, with others also targeted to send a message and also keep his troops busy and having fun. The schizophrenic nature of the Biden Admin, appeasing Soros one minute, cracking down the next, will only intensify and result in Biden at least backing some of the Soros agenda, dumping Israel, demanding Reparations, leading to much of (((Wall Street))) dumping him and choosing the Devil they Know.The Houthis were able to chase much of the US Navy out of the Red Sea (an amphibious assault ship left) as Iran did out of the Persian Gulf. Neither really has a Navy, it is the proliferation of the cheap drones, $1-2K each, versus $1 million per US Navy Missile to shoot them down that is the game changer. Just as they were in Ukraine vs. tanks for either side. The Houthis can launch more drones (and then leave) than the US can sustain missile launches; the missiles cannot by my understanding be replenished at sea for reasons I don’t understand. In order to maintain combat dominance in chokepoints, the US Navy needs new ships with directed energy weapons, and heavy armor to withstand air/surface/underwater drone strikes, and its own drone capacity AT SCALE.None of that is cheap, and even US Navy Admirals excluding “Rachel Levine” can add up the massive costs that the Open Border entails and see no future for military spending. So too can Raytheon and Lockheed/Boeing. Every single illegals implies 40 family members coming in the next five years via chain migration, and together they would cost about a single fighter jet. Every year. A permanent Democratic Majority means all tax money goes directly to illegals.The military (Navy, Air Force, and Army at least) understand they need to withdraw, recoup, and re-arm with a force capable of handing cheap, massively scaled drones. There has likely been talks and bargains with Trump on this as not even the Fed can print money endlessly to cover both the restructuring of the Navy, Air Force, and Army for the Drone Era and endless welfare for illegals. Quite apart from both manpower to create the new Army/Navy/Air Force equipment and man its weaponry.Lastly, White men in general and those in Republican politics face a reckoning. There is literally no future for them in the Diverse Dream of Democrats as all slots upward are taken. If defeated, there will be no board memberships on a Fortune 500 company for them (White, Male, Republican). No sinecures at Harvard. No jobs in the media. They’d be lucky to get Wal-Mart employee. The Soros-Biden Civil War has driven this home to them — for them it is Trump or … work for a living. No one wants that. And for White men in general, even the Tech Frontier is now closed, being an Indian/Chinese thing with token blacks thrown in. Of note, supposedly 63% of men under 30 are single. Make of that what you will.I think this will drive a Biden Impeachment, over hiding Hunter in the White House to evade testimony to Congress, and pay-offs to China.I think Xi will invade Taiwan. To humiliate and destroy Biden as he has personal animosity towards Biden. I think Putin will encourage even more mass immavasion into Europe and various African/Islamist coup attempts in Ireland, the UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Italy. The US helps Ukraine hit Belgorod in drone/missile strikes, Putin uses immavader bio-weapons to stage a Muslim coup attempt in Paris. Both Xi and Putin would rather make a deal that sticks with Trump, even if its not the best, than deal with a collapsing, Soros-War Karen driven US. So they will do their best to undermine Biden at every turn.I frankly see 2024 as a binary choice: Biden or Trump. Trump is the only not Biden. Any other choice would continue War Karen-ing, pushing out of White men from every thing, continued open borders which is an existential no money threat to the Military Complex, and writing checks regarding Russia and China that America’s behind can no longer cash. Sure, the military, the contractors, the White males not already set in the Republican Party would like a Haley or Youngkin but that won’t fly. Its Trump or Biden.

        “[During 2024] The concept of antiwhite will become mainstream as the media continues to push the culture war in advance of the elections. Normal white people will begin to talk publicly about the war on white people. The “great replacement” will go mainstream, and the usual suspects try to scream it down with the usual language, but normal white people will shrug off these tactics. For the first time in generations, the claim of racism will not terrorize normal white people…”

        Trump is removed from the ballot in most blue states. Biden dies of a stroke in May but remains on the ballot because reasons and “A dead Biden is a better Presnit than a live Trump”. In the aftermath of the electoral chaos resulting from this and the fact that over 1 billion people voted by mail, perpetual joke candidate Vermin Supreme is found to be the real winner of the election. Puerto Rico and DC are finally granted statehood but each secedes from the Union three days later. DC declares itself the People’s Democratic Republic of Wakanda and Puerto Rico votes to join Cuba. Within 2 years the former United States has fragmented into over 400 separate nations including 3 feudal Duchies and a Papal State. When asked if he will send a force to invade and stabilize the chaotic former nation Vladimir Putin literally dies laughing.

            Finally! Someone remembered Candidate Supreme. The boot on his head was ahead of its time — doesn’t look so silly now when a feeble potentate, allegedly live-streaming in from a Caribbean island needs to have his handler, wife squeeze his arm not so gently and say, “ice cream, it’s ice cream.”When the inevitable power outages come with failing infrastructure, that ‘pony’ that everyone was to get will be VERY handy as, since Vermin plays 5G chess, it ackshually is a special hybrid Draft Pony, and comes complete with wooden plow and starter set of seeds for planting.Listen to Vermin talk. He makes perfect sense, relative.

        Two Predictions:1: They will try (and likely fail) to take out Trump permanently the old-fashioned JFK way with the added possibility of using a different method, like a freak accident or terrorist attack. Bonus points if they find a Palestinian passport at the scene of the crime so we can send the US military to “fight those terrorists” over there so we don’t have to fight them here while surprise, surprise, clearing out the Palestinian homelands for the Chosen. (BTW, I predict this plan would fail spectacularly on several levels.)2: They will try — and very possibly succeed — in taking out Biden permanently the old-fashioned JFK way. It will be done by someone in a red hat yelling, “This is MAGA country!” And no, I’m not joking.Exaggerating, yes. But joking, no.

                “As for Biden, that creature doesn’t matter. He is a mere placeholder.”Quite true. But this only makes him an ideal sacrificial lamb. If they can false-flag his spectacular death at the hands of Evil MAGA-man, what better way to impose harsh penalties on those White deplorables in middle America?Look what they did on J6. Odds are, they’re rubbing their bony little hands together now, thinking of all the punishment they could mete out to middle American if Biden were JFK’d.Heck, for all we know, the Big Guy is dead in the freezer already, just waiting to be thawed out at an opportune time. Yes, it sounds crazy. But given all the lies we’re subjected to, the odds aren’t completely zero. And that’s saying something.

                    This all makes complete sense to me. Biden wins re-election in a landslide, then – perhaps on Inauguration Day- a “MAGA extremist” assassinates him; the assailant strangely disappears, but leaves behind him a Confederate flag and a tattered copy of ‘My Struggle’.All the news channels, newspapers, and liberal white people with BLM signs in their lawns, then call for a “complete solution to the MAGA problem”. The “conservatives” will dutifully write op-eds making “The Conservative Case for liquidating the MAGAists as a class”.As in 1934 when Stalin had Kirov whacked, thus removing a popular rival and justifying his reign of terror, so the Juggs dispose of the inconvenient Biden, complete their project of reducing the USA to a giant prison, and begin targeting each other as the pie shrinks and the crowd at the trough has to be thinned.

                        Your prediction about a “Biden victory followed by a MAGA assassin” is the best move for our opponents.  I hope that they are not as crafty as you are to come up with this plan.

                        This presumes that the regime sees MAGA as a genuine threat requiring elimination rather than just another useful scapegoat.As things stand they get to paint Trump supporters as a bunch of diabetic fat retards that cause all the country’s problems, throwing them all in gulags would take away that scapegoat.  The greatest recent victories of the dirt people have only been to mildly inconvenience the company making the gay beer and to put a narcissist with a weird face in charge of twitter.  At the same time the regime has shoveled massive amounts of money into the pockets of both themselves and the Goblin Jew with the only blowback being a handful of Unz articles and some leftards doing a few Pajeet My Sons on the sidewalks in protest.The regime does love crying out in pain but I don’t think it’s at all certain that they genuinely perceive any threat to themselves, or if any such threat really exists for that matter.

        A TRUE STORY
Late last night, I awoke to the sound of gunfire.All around me.  Big booms, small pops, even a couple machine guns.
I thought, “This is it!  The balloon’s gone up!” and was halfway to the fields with my go bag when I saw the first fireworks.
I thought, “Waittaminute, I live on the West Side…”This must mean… this must be…
Happy New Year’s, everyone!

        For some reason my infallible tea leaves only partly agree with your goat entrails. You sure you used the right goat??– Zelinsky is removed and moves to Germany which is forced to take him. Ukraine surrenders thereafter– Russia having had an epiphany, strikes a secret deal with the real capital of the US, Jerusalem, that it will put pressure on Iran to ease the pressure on Israel in exchange for Nato giving up Ukraine. Russia will therefore not send anymore AD to Syria once it has gauged how it’s AF stacks up against competently piloted US aircraft– the bizarre word ‘racism’ will indeed lose its dark magic power– inflation will keep rising as the dollar loses ground to gold, bitcoin and the ruble and yuan– during serious riots several sacret black rocket scientists are shot while removing electronics and clothes from stores – presumably for their rocket science and space suit research – by evil white racists. But instead of being cowed more white racists support their fellow racists and while war Karen promises to hang the racists, trump promises to pardon them . Biden goes on national television, watched by five residents of a retirement home in Vermont and two in North Dakota, to give the “national unity is a shining Jill I can’t find the toilet” speech. It is given six stars out of five in the WP for it’s “eternal rhetorical brilliance”– food, gasoline, ammo and used cars (internal combustion) continue rising in price– major riots in Poland as the neo commie EU stooges continue their crackdown on racists– Trump is on the ballot in twenty states in November, some other GOP dude in the rest and so are two different Democrats, a white Karen and a gay Tongan who, to his considerable surprise, was escorted by the border patrol directly to the democratic convention right after crossing the border to be nominated for president of these United States. In a historical breakthrough, for the first time ever there are three declared winners of a presidential election– China offers to buy Taiwan. Which black rock immediately offers to facilitate– Disney world secedes from Florida– the Nobel prize for physics is given to a nonbinary researcher from the University of Hemp in the Netherlands for the discovery of the gay particle which proves that god doesn’t exist but if xe did xe would be nonbinary shemale gay– Shawama Bethuba from Columbia University is given the presidential medal of freedom for discovering that electricity is actually white privilege– Hunter Biden is found dead from what law enforcement called a self-induced butthole– In mid December, as lawyers want to consult the original constitution to resolve the election, it is discovered that the night guard of the national archives, Obongo from the Congo, has used it to make a shaman costume to drive away white magic. The NAACP immediately praises this stroke of genius in finding new ways to understand the ensuring power of the Constitution– Trudeau up north signs a law making assisted suicide compulsary for any pale Canuck over the age of 65And so ends a new normal year at the end of history

        New thing I’m seeing in everyday life and I think will become statistically noticeable: white spinsters hurrying into marriage so they can live in a man’s house or install a man in theirs. Physical threat level (immigration) has escalated enough that they’re at least subconsciously registering a need to employ security.Biden’s dementedly whispered promise that the GOP would no longer exist by election day 2024 hasn’t come true yet. They seem to have screwed up the plan. Or maybe not. Final execution may be a last-minute “election season” thing.If there is an election, the eternally promised increase in non-white Republican voters will not appear. The Asian vote will become much more solidly Democrat, because anti-white “global majority” rhetoric so deeply moves them that a diasporan pan-Asian identity has finally been produced by it. (They don’t realize it means Africans, not them.) Only Trump has appeal beyond “the base” and by election day he’ll be dead.Trump will be murdered by a cop. It’s the most thoroughly “predictively programmed” event since the destruction of the World Trade Center.

        “What no one will discuss in public is that Youngkin has deep ties to the military industrial complex, the neocons, and the intelligence community. He is this generations version of George H. W. Bush, a guy who does what is required to satisfy the rubes in fly over country, but is primarily loyal to the permanent ruling class.”Eminently plausible. The MIC is what really matters. The only part of the US economy really functioning and that only because of its symbiotic relationship with the imperial state (or deep state, if you wish).The Federal Reserve will try to put some lipstick on this pig of a domestic economy, which will be coupled with US media shrieking on how we’ve never had it this good.Argentina will go to hell but who cares?“The Israelis will keep trying to escalate the Gaza war in order to draw in the United States, but the Iranians will not take the bait. Russia will start to upgrade the Syrian air defense systems as a way to both defend against Israeli attacks and to open another front in the proxy war with the Global American Empire. The Saudis agree to move forward with Russia and China on developing their nuclear program, signaling an end to the Saudi-American relationship that has defined the region…”There will be some black swan over there.“The Biden administration will intensify efforts to confiscate Russian assets currently frozen in Western banks. The stated goal is to free up money for Ukraine, but the real point is to bring Russian to the table. The administration wants to avoid a total collapse in Ukraine by “freezing” the war. The Russians are not stupid so they have no interest in that idea, but the West thinks the threat of confiscating Russian assets could force the Russians to reconsider their position.”Not a snowball’s chance in hell of working. The Russians are willing to write it off. Something this stupid will be the death knell of the dollar as everyone in the world will shrink away from the dollar and from American and European banks. But because it’s stupid I expect Team Biden to go for it.

Well, seeing as I live there, I do. And I’m more sanguine about what may happen in the country, although it may fall apart due to cowardice on the part of the general population, much like what’s happened in the USA and Europe. Credulity, cowardice and complacency, the enemies of change. Don’t count Milei out quite yet.

        As a corollary to the Z-man’s prediction regarding removing Trump from the ballot, Biden wins in a landslide in 2024 as disgruntled Trump voters realize they have been disenfranchised by the Republican party and stay home on election day. Texas goes blue. This marks the end of the Republican party as a national political force.Extending to 2025, the rainbow coalition of the Democratic party establishment claims that the landslide victory gives them a mandate to govern from the far-left. Their legislative priorities include reparations, amnesty and citizenship for illegal immigrants, and mandatory automatic motor voter registration and mail-in voting nationwide. In exchange for meaningless promises of border reform, a sufficient number of Republicans will fold and all three initiatives will pass.As the amnesty legislation is implemented, it will become apparent that the estimate of 12MM illegal immigrants was wildly low, and the true number is in excess of 30MM. Between 5-10 of the contested states that are currently purple (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada) turn deep blue overnight. Lawfare organizations, backed by the Biden DoJ, file civil rights lawsuits seeking to compel states to redraw congressional districts to accommodate the revised population numbers, and left-wing judges rule in their favor. Republicans lose 30-40 seats in the House as a result, with no hope of ever gaining a majority again.

I’m struggling to see a downside to this, given the decades of GOP cuckery and ‘reaching across the aisle’ to give the Left what they want.

            3g4me, promise me you will remember the following words:ROOMTEMPERATURELIPIDNANO-PARTICLESWhen they start bragging about having created &amp; sustained Room Temperature Lipid Nano Particles, then you’ll know that The End Times are near.The only reason they failed to meet all of their objectives with the original COVID-19 psy-op was because the Pfizer &amp; Moderna v@xxines had to be stored at something like a sustained NEGATIVE ninety-two degrees Fahrenheit, and of course the various step-n-fetch-it groids in the distribution channel couldn’t even dream of meeting those kinds of requirements.But if they can engineer the Lipid Nanoparticles to be effective at room temperature [which apparently they’re working on furiously right now], then they can [at least theoretically] destroy every single eukaryotic life form on the entire planet.ROOMTEMPERATURELIPIDNANO-PARTICLES

        Pretty much everybody, normie included, seems to think 2024 will be a year of great upheaval. Everybody’s kind of on edge since 2020. Like waiting for the other shoe to drop. Maybe that’s an indicator that not much that’s so dramatic will happen. Lulling folks back to sleep before the real crisis year of 2025.However, politically, we’re approaching a situation in which neither competing party appears legitimate, which makes the environment ripe for some kind of apparent coup, to restore order and “legitimacy” and “normalcy,” perhaps a military coup, although whoever perpetrates this coup will have the backing of the usual globalists and regime apparatchiks. It would just be the regime perpetuating itself with a different face. The blob dropping the pretense of representative democracy but people being ok with it as long as the amazon prime deliveries run on time.

        The Government Party will run out of time to throw out primary votes and install their preferred “candidates”.  Their business model is built on the illusion of choice.  Trump has the primary basically wrapped up on Super Tuesday.  We’ll get a limp repeat of Ted Cruz 2016.  Conservative Inc has so debased itself that (unlike 2016) they will be unable to mount a serious challenge to Trump.  The RNC has already canceled the remaining debates.  They are going broke as voters reject sending them money.  Mega donors are cutting back as well because the GOP commands no voting base.  That’s why CNN is going to host debates in January.  These will remind voters that almost  nobody on that stage is their friend and will be fan fiction events for Democrat voters who want 2-hours of Trump bashing.  Democrats have resigned themselves to Biden.  The media narrative – the narrative rules all – this year is already shifting to a Trump win.  “Red wave” will re-enter the narrative.SCOTUS will smack down Trump ballot cases, 9-0.  At least one of the indictments gets tossed (probably Miami).  The other one goes to trial after Trump wins.  Post-election Democrat violence results in Trump being sworn in at a small ceremony in the Oval Office.As I wrote the other day, Ukraine transitions to a low intensity insurgent/terror war against Russia.  Settle in for the long war, ala Afghanistan 1980.  No political candidates other than Trump will discuss it, and they will be protected by the media.  The topic is now radioactive.China has huge demographic problems.  They don’t need to invade Taiwan.  They need the manufacturing base, and will instead chip away at Taiwan’s independence playing the long game.  They will keep their puppet in North Korea in check because they don’t want to help Trump who they helped overthrow (COVID).Nothing crazy will happen in the economy this year.  Inflation will persist and we will be spoon fed lies (remember when it was “transitory” 3 years ago?).  It’s an election year.  All government/media resources will be deployed to defend the regime.  It doesn’t matter how citizens feel.  The Government Party abandoned them years ago.  Only Government employees matter.  Stocks will go up a bit anticipating a return to cheap money, but energy driven inflation will require the Fed to create a recession to slow energy demand which means rates will come down but not by enough to change things.  6-7% mortgage rates are here to stay for awhile.  In the long run, this is a good thing.  Cheap money is economic heroin.There will be open calls to deploy the military on the Mexican side of the border.  Parents sending their kids to school in September will be absolutely shocked to see that 10-15% of the kids in their schools speak NO English whatsoever.  The schools will continue their slow drift into collapse as teachers – fearing for their lives and refusing to learn Spanish – continue to flee public school teaching.  This, too, will be papered over by the media, but the usual “you’re a racist” slanders will have no effect.  In fact, expect people to increasingly embrace it as a badge of honor.  Calls to put them all on busses and deport them will increase.  Sanctuary cities will see blacks rioting because the invaders are taking jobs and decimating the schools.  Blacks rioting in black run cities over the imposition of millions of foreigners will be blamed on White Privilege.  Trump gets 40% of the black vote.  CivNats will proclaim “they love us now!” and “Democrats are the real racists!” but be totally perplexed by the rioting.DIE, like CRT, becomes a pariah concept and gets a new name.  But the cancer will continue to spread.Israel will continue to mow down Gaza and blow up the tunnel networks.  Nobody will care.  Pro Hamas protesters will continue to harass Democrats in Democrat cities helping everyone understand that “the Palestinians” as a people are just trash, which is why no ME nation will take them.  Every family has that one asshole nobody likes.  Trump will call for a two state solution and his voters will flip on a dime to supporting this.A major streaming service will go bankrupt this year.The Catholic Church will start preaching pro gay themes leading to church flight.  The USCCB will lecture the laity that “God is love” means you go to hell unless you support Frank marrying John.  Multiple priests will come out as openly gay and become media stars.  Local parishes start to fracture as their “progressive” members scream at them about tolerance.At least one Trump assassination attempt.  It will fail.

                    I was having a little fun there.  However, do not be surprised if Trump picks Ben Carson as his VP.  There will be a big push by the CivNats for him to pick Byron Donalds who says the soothing words and chants that prove the rest of what I wrote.

        My predictions:* Another year with nobody being punished for the vaxx deaths/injuries. Vaxx injuries will be mentioned in the media from time to time as a rare occurrence. Excess deaths will remain forbidden topic for the media and a “conspiracy theory” for the uninformed masses.* GOP will not find a replacement for Trump. There will be a lot of bluffing, though.* US stock market will decline at least 15% before going back up. Interest rates will start dropping fast after that.* As usual, Israel will face no consequences for their brutal and inhumane actions. Instead they will claim victimhood (as always) and both sides of the Uniparty and all respectable European parties will agree and amplify* China will keep growing despite experts predicting a collapse “this time for real”* A Chinese company will announce a breakthrough in the field of photolithography.

        “My book will be the number one Christmas gift in 2024…”Another great thing about the escape from Lagos is the fact that you can write from Uncle Z’s cabin in the mountains.I heard that “Feed the World” song far too often this Christmas season. That line “do they know it’s Christmas time at all” makes me laugh now. If they don’t know it’s Christmas time in Africa, it’s not for the reasons the song suggests. Africans had no idea how to track time until the calendar was introduced to them.It’ll be a good day when larger numbers of White people laugh at the mention of Whites being inherently evil.Happy New Year to Zman and all commenters. I’m grateful for all I’ve learned from this site. I’d wager I’ve learned over six bazillion things since I began reading years ago. Thanks to each of you.

        I would like to see the New Year’s prediction motif replaced with a “prescription” variant in which we each seek to promote solutions to anticipated problems that are forecast for the coming year. Proactivity versus doom porn. In this spirit, I advise the following.When Trump is cancelled from the election, stay home, and when Bongino knocks on your door to badger you about voting harder, kick him in the nuts.When the GOP anoints its Trump replacement, go to his rallies and call him a backstabbing two-faced faggot neocon piece of shit, and then hurl real feces at his face. Extra points for hurling a bag of diarrhea.Since our host has now become the Bob Villa of home improvement, I suggest constructing a Punji pit w/trap door at the entrance in order to welcome the Stasi to your humble abode.No matter who is on the ballot this election, your yard sign should read “Putin for President.”And finally, when inflation goes through the roof and the joggers start raiding the Safeway en masse, get out that old can of shoe black and join in the fun.

        Happy New Year!I would agree with your comment regarding online television programming. Hardly anyone in the family watches Netflix, Amazon or Disney for the reasons you stated. But I have to admit, watching commercials with Africans in lederhosen, swilling beer in the Bavarian Alps are hysterical. Laughs all around!Here’s how I see 2024 for Europe and Germany –Immigration –Last week the EU included Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area. Citizens of Kosovo can now travel visa-free within the European Union’s Schengen areas effective January 1st. This means western Europe can expect a flood of people seeking economic opportunities (aka – social benefits). Hungary and Poland will be without the legal means to stop them.Housing –Given the serious lack of housing (let alone affordable housing) in Germany and most of Europe, I expect the EU, in a combined effort with the WHO, will to take a hard look at anyone who owns multi-family property. Especially in cases where a two-family home (duplex) was shared by family members who have passed away, and the vacant property has not been rented out. Any property owner with vacant property will be forced to house all these new immigrants.AFD Outlawed –The CDU is currently the largest party with around 25%, however the AFD is around 21% and growing faster than any other party. This will be seen as a huge threat to the mainstream parties (SPD, CDU and FDP) who will argue the AFD is an extremist, right wing party and is a threat to democracy as we know it. The German BIV (same as your FBI) will clamp down on the AFD and their investigations will result in the AFD being deemed “unconstitutional” and banned. It wouldn’t be the first time a political party was banned in Germany.EV Production –This is a huge issue for the German automotive economic sector which is significant part of our entire economy. While EVs did gain popularity over the past few years, government rebates for EVs were terminated a few weeks ago.  As Scholz and his minions cut back or end give-away programs everywhere they can, EV infrastructure spending will come to a grinding halt. For consumers, an EV in Europe is 27% more expensive than a petrol car. With higher inflation and electrical prices, EVs will become economically impractical for the average consumer.Education –Elementary and secondary education will continue to decline as teachers will simply quit due to social and sexual diversity agendas being pushed on them. Fewer young people will consider teaching as a career especially when they have had first hand experience with the conditions of the schools they came from.A increase in non-German speaking students will make teaching and learning nearly impossible and students will be given passing marks just to get them out of the educational system. Additionally, a greater number of  these students will quit out of frustration and/or because they have figured out how to master the social benefits programs.At the same time, with fewer and fewer careers opportunities and a massive lack of government and private investment in industry, those who do graduate from university will leave Germany for better paying jobs in other countries.Summary –2024 will be a darker, colder, dumber and poorer year for Europe and Germany.

                September 26, 2023“Germany plans to halve the federal aid allocated for states to cover the expenses of receiving and integrating refugees next year as part of belt-tightening amid soaring inflation and economic slowdown. The federal government will cut refugee costs to 1.25 billion euros for the years from 2024, from 3.75 billion euros this year.”“…the states must provide their municipalities with the necessary financial resources,”The Federal government is simply “passing the buck” directly to the states.You can imagine how well this will play for Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his coalition government in the 2025 election cycle.https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-halve-federal-aid-refugees-next-year-sources-2023-09-25/

                    I already do.  I enjoy thrifting and flea marketing. Never miss an opportunity to pick up CDs I don’t already have or occasionally movies I’d like to see.  It’s cheaper than renting them used to be. Mostly you can pick em up for a Dollar.  I also buy VCR tapes. I’ve gotten a lot of good fights on VCR tape.  One of these days I’m gonna invest in a blue ray player. But you don’t see many blue ray movies in thrift stores, yard sales and flea markets.  I used to have a really good newsgroups provider.  I downloaded hundreds of movies in SVCD and DVD back in the day off of the binary newsgroups.

                Nord Stream was just the straw that broke the camels back. If we had a more technically diversified industrial portfolio, it’s unlikely that would have been a major issue.Germany has been relying on cheap Russian gas for ages and as a result, kicked the “energy issue” can down the road year after year. And because they lack the spine, the coalition government allowed the Greens to shut down our nuclear power program.Trump was right on the mark about Russian gas. But the arrogance of German politicians laughing at him was typical of our elite rulers. German leaders like Chancellor Scholz all think they are smarter than everyone else.German industrialists and our government should have invested into more technology and light industry in the same way Silicon Valley did back in the 80’s and 90’s. Instead, they gave our machine tool and auto manufacturing technology to China. They now makes better cars than we do which is why VW is failing here and there in Germany.Our new year is going to be repeat of the 1973–1975 recession and stagflation.

                I have heard that Tesla has had their fair share of labor problems, but nothing exceptional. Since they are a relatively new company here in Germany, they probably hired a lot of inexperienced people to get things going.
No one with an established career with VAG, Ford or Mercedes would willingly leave their job for an offer with Tesla. The major German automakers have a very good reputation for paying and treating their employees very well.

        I predict that some of the usual assholes will finally start getting theirs. As the stinkers at Blab say, mail-in voating will become popular among the Unabomber demographic on both sides of the political aisle. Chicago and the entire state of California will attempt to pay reparations to noggers, and black poverty and evil white privilege will start to reach critical mass.The deplorables will begin a BLM-esque campaign of ‘shoot, shovel, and shut up’. The Boogaloonians will be framed by the FBI, along with their cohorts in the Proud Boys, Oaf Keepers, etc.Gold and silver will become legal tender in some rogue states. Antisemitism will continue to escalate. Odds are 50/50 that Uncle Sam loses a carrier or an entire flotilla in the Red Sea.And I – the Oracle Of Aaaaaadmontin, Alberta – will finally be recognized for my talent as a clairvoyant, and my followers will shower me with wealth and riches.

            Regarding reparations, I do not believe any of these blue cities or states intend to pay reparations. The strategy will be to get a sufficient number of blue cities/states to implement reparations programs, then demand the federal government pay the tab.
New York just formed a commission to evaluate reparations. Many of the other blue cities or states will form commissions and make recommendations in 2024. There’s a good chance it will get to fedgov in 2025, and if the Democrats are in charge it will pass.

                The repubs might even go along with your scenario, to “get it over with”, “yeah, now those devilish Dems can’t hang this over our heads anymore”, and “they’ll have to remove the race card from their playbooks now” as their excuses.

                Successfully fobbing the 6 quintillion-gorillion dollar tab for reparations onto the federal government pretty much guarantees that secession goes mainstream even faster than it already is. Even the White cucklibs here in Oregon don’t want to pay for every Shitavious in Cali to get a new sound system in his Escalade.

            Why the downvotes? Do you still think we can get out of this mess without some pretty major pain? Some minor pain now might save us from really big pain later. Those guys in the region don’t belong there so they’re pretty much on their own as far as I can see. You serve Moloch, well there’s a price to pay. That goes for everyone in the MIC even the ones making weapons and ammunition given to the Ukraine.

“What’s with folks”—well, the above.  One can predict, but to wish for such an event is still beyond the pale for most of us.  Such an event is fraught with grave danger of all out war between nuclear powers.  30 minutes and it’s all over type of conflict.  That is never to be wished for—unless you are a Neocon, whose fondest wish *is* for war.

                    The US government will get their war any time they want, lost ship or no.  Putting them in harms way up the odds substantially – and of course gives them an ironclad ready made excuse.  The government here has been prodding the bear and dragon (among others) for years.  Sooner or later it’s going to one too many – I predict.

        I will re-up that this is the year the GOP unofficially dies nationally. That is regardless of how the Trump show trials/nomination/ballot removal play out. Conservatives indeed are incredibly stupid but the also-needed Normies who would vote for him don’t really do ideology and simply will stay home if he does not appear on the ballot. If he is nominated, Never Trump will go full bore for a True Conservative independent. Both Normies and to a lesser extent conservatives won’t go to the polls for Younkin, if that happens (and it is a very good prediction), and the party will implode nationally. This obviously would be a good thing since it would increase the need for white identity politics/responses, related to the last item below.I agree with your economic analysis, but there is a good chance inflation soars so much in the first quarter the brakes on potential rate cutting have to be tapped. Powell has been a sober surprise thus far, and while he certainly would like to juice things to help the Regime in an election year, that might have to be put on hold. Either way, there will be a traumatic downturn in the United States economy by the latter part of the year because the Western world’s power is about to plunge due to its perceived and actual weaknesses (what follows plays into that).internationally, the Ukraine will be abandoned early in the first half of the year. It is happening now but this will pick up speed over the next few months. Since Biden is likely to be reinstalled (and even if he isn’t), discussion of the money spent/stolen will need to be squelched at all costs. No one would get in trouble for the grand theft, mind you, but nothing can be allowed that would put the MIC grift in peril although that too will come to an end soon enough.I agree with you about anti-white racism becoming a really hot issue. The wildcard for me is how this massive wave of migration plays into that mix. It is likely to be the one thing that accelerates the ongoing dissolution and fragmentation of the United States and similar frictions in Western Europe. I offer no prediction there other than it portends to be catastrophic for the Regime when the dust settles. France, Ireland, and the United States are all tinderboxes and there easily could be multiple crises.If we continue to have internet service, we’ll all compare notes a year from today.

            We are at at least 60,000,000, outright illegal aliens in the country now.  That grows by about 250,000, per month.   That actually badly understates the problem because many/most of the resident alien card holders are just as bad as their illegal cousins.   Combine all of that with the first generations of the said “immigrants”  and you are easily over half the population that has no loyalty to America.
We have not had a nation in a very long time.  Soon we won’t even have any semblance of a country.

                Yes. The United States made itself ungovernable on its own volition. It will continue to use raw power and totalitarian methodologies but tens of millions of unknowns roaming the land moots such control efforts. We will suffer, but so will the psychopaths who brought about this situation, for whatever little comfort that offers. It will explode no matter what the Regime thinks. It can hunker down in D.C. but that is not a long-term strategy for survival. This will make Marxist-Leninism appear rational and well thought out.

                60M sounds a bit high, but if you include DACA, then probably on.  I would point out however, these DACA folk are different than those coming across since Trump.  They are basically Americans in behavior and such.  New arrivals will not assimilate, but will group and feed ghettos based on nationality/race.  This is *not* unnatural or unprecedented and is why we have in the past created moratoriums on immigration.  The goal being assimilation.  But that was before clown world.It would be wise of Congress to initiate a midterm census to attempt to measure just how fucked we are, but then again “wise” and “Congress” usually implies a non sequitur on the part of the commenter.

                    Non-assimilation is the point, I think. It really isn’t possible anyway, but a separate nation within a nation appears to be the goal.
Lebanon has a constitution based on a census last taken in the Sixties, I think. Demographics have changed so spectacularly there that a census cannot be taken because it would overturn the applecart since offices are appointed on religious affiliations. There will be similar resistance to an accurate account here eventually for similar reasons since everyone involved would have a gored ox.

                        Yep, the US Census is subject to the same corruptions.  For example, waay long ago we had racial characterizations of “White” and “Hispanic”.  This did not produce the desired numbers of Hispanics since many of them choose “White”, so we now have “Hispanic-White” categorization.  I won’t even try to explain why we have so much emphasis on Pacific Islanders and such.  Seems there is a new minority classification every major census.

                        Reminds me of a good story.The first census I ever took (long form, mid-term Census to obtain Residential Housing info in the USA) was given/sent to me when I lived in the dormitory.  Confused, but intrigued, I called their help number.  After a bit, they located my name and began to go over the form with me and fill it out from my answers.What I called for was that the questions asked did *not* suit my present condition—a broke student living with 80 other broke students in one of the university’s dormitories. They would brook none of that, so we went through the form question by question.Example, “How many bedrooms in your present home/dwelling?”  Ah…”40”?  “Thank you, now how many bathrooms in your dwelling?  Ah…”16”?  “Thank you, now how many people do you live with in your home?  Ah …80?  “Thank you, now…?”It was, as they say, a real “hoot”.  I could hardly contain myself.  I was naive in those days, but as I think upon it, I was involved in a pretty good example of bureaucratic incompetence.  I can only wonder how many outrageous responses might have been solicited from prison convicts and the like. 😉

I think there has been a push to invoke a sense of inevitability about minority status. For all we know we are a minority even now, but the push is to make us feel that way.
The dorm story is great!

                    Compsci:  Assimilation is a chimera.  What actually happens is more an amalgamation or a synthesis.  White, Christian, Europeans were able to achieve this in the US, although the Irish, Italians, and even Germans changed and shaped America at least as much as it changed them.
No such even semi-successful synthesis is possible with Indios, subcons, and east Asians (not to mention sub-Saharans).  You can dress them in jeans, feed them pizza, give them a sail foam, and pretend they speak English, but you’re merely gilding the pig.
You end up with Brazil . . . if you’re lucky.

                        Assimilation aside, these DACA folk have grown up here and are (rightly) seen as a cut above “Jose and company” who arrived last week.  Further, these DACA recipients are by and large employed and absorbed by the system.  New arrivals are not. Rejection/expulsion of new arrivals is infinitely easier than those DACA recipients.Politics is said to be the art of the possible, therefore I keep such divisions separate as I do for IA’s from Africa as compared to say, South America.  And African “imports” are getting to be a significantly large proportion compare to numbers a decade or so ago.  (This I hear is because they are being shipped up from South American countries who don’t want Africans in their countries either.). 😉

White, Christian, Europeans were able to achieve this in the US, although the Irish, Italians, and even Germans changed and shaped America at least as much as it changed them.”I think that argument can be made for the Mestizos.  Simon Bolivar changed the nature of South America; emulating his hero, George Washington, he created six Constitutionally based nations.So now, the Mestizos are repeating what the German and Irish waves did.  Remember, in 1850 our Congress was 10 votes away from making German the official language, so great was the Prussian influx.  Truman’s campaign train made stops in small towns that spoke no English; the bemused natives still spoke German at home, much like Navajo speak Diné (or Latinos, Spanish.)So I am going to posit that the Centro-Sur Americas are the Goths to our Rome.They want to continue our civilization.It was the malignant Contra and Communist influences that drove them to shite.  Both Intelligence and Radicals are subterranean cultures feeding off of crime and disruption, foreign infiltrators from the same historical root, at that.

                        Addendum:  that same historical root was free to resurrect their culture in the Conquistador era.Although officially banned from Spain, they found new opportunity in the Americas as well as in Moorish lands.They made Indian slavery a centerpiece of the Conquest economy; they controlled the baronial plantations harvesting hardwoods for the Spanish galleons and fruits, vegetables, and spices from the New World.Many are still present as hereditary ruling families such as in the fruit companies of Guatemala, Mexican border cities such as Monterrey, or in politics across South America.The New World was particularly suited to their nomadic merchant culture; they rode along with and even captained many of the Catholic ships, just as they did with the Puritans in Newport, English in Charlestown, and French in New Orleans.(And, Schofield evangelicals, and the boards of directors for nominally Christian immigrant relocation services.)This culture colonized our State Department and Wall Street as well, leading to Smedley Butler, the CIA/MIC, and equity funds as modern forms of joint-stock East India Companies.(No, it’s not all “them”.  The way to get past the stifling JQ is to simply say “us, adopting J**ish characteristics.”)

            The Vichy GOP will likely find some way to push Dickless Cheney over the line. How can they resist nominating a non-white subcontinental woman who wants to bomb everyone and end internet anonymity?  The larger historical justification is a last minute substitution from the vape-filled backrooms at the Stupid Party’s convention of someone not even running would be quite out of the ordinary and inertia is king. On the other hand, no one expected the Trump phenomenon…

        I’m not near as optimistic as you Zman. The oscillations are increasing, and the bridge collapsing is getting nearer. My five predictions:1. A nuclear weapon will be used against a civilian population somewhere by someone.2. A new highly virulent and directed paque will be unleashed across the world.3. Trump will be eliminated from the election one way or another. This will result in the most corrupt evil government ever to curse the planet taking over (and that’s saying something!).4. Ukraine falls.5. The Gods of the Copybook Headings ring in 2025.I give the chances of 3 out of 5 happening at better than even. If not even one happens then I will seriously consider my pessimistic views are due to the realization all men face when they’re closer to the end then the beginning and see that reflected in everything around them. Time will tell.Best to all, and thanks for the stimulating essays over the past year Zman!

        #WhiteVotesCount works in any political configuration.It will work especially well as a shit test in the scenario described above, in which the anti-white media may do some part of the work for us.The best outcome would be for Youngkin to lose after accidentally mumbling something vaguely pro-white, leading conservatives to conlcude that they would have won if they had only been more anti-white.On the other hand, #WhiteVotesCount will prime some part of the base to engage in a boycott if Trump is not on the ballot.  Or even if he is on the ballot but has learned nothing and engages in Platinum Plan 2.0 rhetoric.  Greg Johnson’s polling project may be useful here.I am convinced that if we work hard enough, we can turn Texas blue.The point of #WhiteVotesCount is not about votes or counting.  It is about moving normal white voters to begin identiyfing themselves as white by appealing to their sense of fair play and their faith in voting.When this faith is inevitably shatterd, the racial consciousness will be all that remains.

            I give Johnson a lot of grief, deservedly so over the ethnostate LARPing, but his goal to make white identity a moral issue is brilliant and laudable. The wind is at our back on this point.

        1.  If by some quirk Orange man bad actually pulls off an election win, the entire country will finally be introduced and understand in a very personal way the concept of a “color revolution”.(CIA loves this trick, has done it worldwide for 70 years, but normal US citizens haven’t heard of it or think it’s crazy talk)2.  Republicans will sign onto a mass amnesty bill, instantly giving the franchise to tens of millions of newly created voters that are being shipped around the country at this moment and avoid 1 (see above).  A totally legal, too.  They’re not called the stupid party for nothing.

        I’m surprised you don’t think Trump will end up in jail or dead.You have way more faith in normal white people than I do.I was at a small NYE gathering and there were two guys there who caught my eye.  One was a white normie wearing a Packers jersey.  The other, an older black man, the only one.  I overheard them talking and eventually the vibrant just had to mention how his grandfather had to use the back door to enter a BBQ joint.  I swear, these creatures just can’t ever NOT be “victims”.  All of the preferences and advantages in the fucking world, yet he focuses on using the back door at a restaurant generations ago.The Normie McNormerson was clearly a Trump guy, but was attempting to gain the approval of the magic negro by stating how Trump is too old and what we really need is DeSantis to “clean up”.All I could think about, listening to this idiocy, was how much I don’t want to live in a society with these people.Happy new year!  My 2024 bring the revolution.

            The DeSantis crew is emblematic of upper class conservatives. They are too embedded to want drastic upheavals, so they hope DeSantis can just calm things down.

            Not an expert, but China still has close to billion peasants scraping the ground for a “living”.  I still maintain they have a supply of able, and relatively smart young Chinese available whereas the Western nations either shrink or attract low IQ Browns and Blacks to maintain their population numbers.

Your points are exactly why I think the West’s internal attempts at digital control schemes will fail.
It’s hard to say if China would ever move in on the West and openly try to impose such schemes.
On the other hand, I think it can be argued that TikTok and Temu are the leading edge of their attempts to do so by proxy.

                There aren’t nearly a billion Chinese living hand to mouth.  The spread of a fairly middle class (by Chinese standards) lifestyle is quite widespread.  Their poverty is worse than ours but it’s hardly Great Leap Forward standard.

                    Their (average) standard of living is not my immediate concern.  And I agree, they are not the starving masses I may have implied.  Yet they have *not* nearly converted from a rural based populace to an urban based populace as we did in the early 20th century.There is much room for automation in the country-side.  We did this in the late 19th century and early 20th.  We once had 90 percent agricultural employment.  Now about 3%.  The excess labor went to the cities and  viola, we became an industrial powerhouse.Chinese were living in abject poverty toward the end of the Moa regime (late 70’s).  Is there any historical equivalent for a country to achieve so much advancement in 50 years?  They certainly have any number of problems achieving/adjusting to modernity as we perceive it here in the West.  And much of that is cultural *as well as* genetic.It’s the population upon which they build that interests me.I believe they have a higher innate IQ that the West and the magnitude of the overall population should produce a very large “Smart Fraction”.  The West on the other hand is traveling in the other direction.I see China as following Korea and Japan in development—just a few decades behind—sans the population decline problems these countries now experience.  Although most disagree with me, I think China’s decline in population will be weathered better than most people think.

                Certainly no expert.Looks it’s OK to make generalisations but at least don’t be ‘Not Even Wrong’ when you do.China’s rural population in 2022 is ~490M. Urban population is ~920M. And this didn’t happen last week. The transformation has taken decades. But your mental model of China appears to be back in 1985 or 1990. And that rural population has 5G internet smartphone banking and micropayments, is surprisingly literate thanks to going to Chinese public schools not American ones, and knows far more about what is happening in US presidential elections than your average American Normie Voter. (Consider that there is zero need to censor *American* political news in PRC and in fact every incentive to boost it: Res Ipsa Loquitur. Best advertisement ever for the 2024 iteration of the CPC deserving to hold the Mandate of Heaven.)Yeah yeah… Chinese statistics Fu Manchu whatyagunnadoo…Those upside down demographic pyramid robotic slanty-eyed ants have hypersonic missiles. DisUnited Latifundias of  Raytheon and Black Rock no havee. It’s just a matter of hours and minutes in geopolitical time before Chinkee havee Extreme UV Lithography.Yeah… they still have peasants tilling the soil — with machinery of course. I’ve been in back blocks of Hainan Island not 100km from space launch sites and boomer pens where the locals get around on tuk-tuks in the countryside. Big deal. You have Fentanyl and a demoralised deracinated White Underclass in need of uplifting. Worry about them. China gonna China.

            Is it just me or does it seem the larger part of the “entertainment” available on the talking screen appears to be aimed solely at women?  It’s all gussied-up soap operas. Family members were watching “The Morning Show” and while I ignored as much as possible some impressions seeped through. Why would any man care about dramatizing the Steamy, Juicy, Behind the Scenes Machinations of TV Morning Talk Shows?  Nothing Hollywood says about itself is true in the first place. And who but women would care about a thinly disguised exploration of the Matt Lauer me-too thing, or be interested in the onscreen display of lavish lifestyles and expensive clothing?All of these characters were noxious and a YouTube video about clipping toenails would be more fruitful.

                There’s a book by Neil Postman titled “How to Watch the Evening News.” One of the points he makes is that the audience is the product and advertisers are the market for the product. This observation always seems trite when stated out loud, but the answer to your question is that entertainment is fundamentally aimed at advertisers since they are the ones paying for it. Network heads don’t rub elbows with the proles to figure out what they’d like to watch, they run elbows with the c-suite persyns. The insidious reality is that shows like the View are like general fashion memos from the corporate elites to housewives of the upper middle class who aspire to join the upper ranks. They don’t watch it because it appeals to them, they watch it to know what’s currently in fashion.

        &gt; The Supreme Court will take one of the 14th amendment cases, but hold off on delivering a verdict, giving the Republicans time to figure out how to expel Trump and relieve the court of this burdenOne thing a conservative Supreme Court is not is bold. The Roe v Wade decision was a punt to the states to undo a decision even most liberals thought was meritless.2020 showed that the SC is terrified of any election ruling, and while I doubt the case Texas brought had much merit, it was exactly the case the SC was designed for, so the no standing dismissal was absurd.Also, 90 percent sure Kavanaugh and Barrett hate Trump, and they likely have pictures of Roberts diddling kids, so even if they took a case, it will be ugly

In a world where Republican officials of any kind never miss a chance to fink on their party’s voters, keen observers like Robert Barnes, who expect the court to intervene, may see that instead of stepping in to stop the madness, the Terribly Republican SCOTUS will find it easy to dither and avert its eyes.

                Yeah, Barnes points out how the justices prefer to hide in their desk wells rather than overturn rulings of lower courts or reverse legislation. I think he said they only average 1 case per week, but thinks they should handle many times that, considering their interns do most of the work. Their ideal Christmas gift would probably be a robe of invisibility, ala Harry Potter!

We also gave Gorsuch who turned SJW by decreeing (along with the usual suspects) that half of Oklahoma is still an Indian reservation.   Gorsuch is also an immigration squish.

            I disagree with both your and Z-man’s predictions about SCOTUS..If they don’t dispose of this cancer, Red States will start removing Biden from the ballot..Since the legal theory behind it is a bad joke, they can dispose of it simply on the basis that an elected President is not an Officer under the 14th, which is the existing precedent…I’m also dubious that the Republican party is that willing to commit suicide, going the way of the Whigs, because Trump will start his own party if necessary..

                I agree that they will take the CO/ME cases and overturn them in the narrowest way possible.
Seven out of the nine members may hate Trump and personally hope he gets stopped, but they are all turbo-narcissists, and will do what they can so that SCOTUS has their hands clean and is not the one blamed for the rigging.

                    Conservatives basically have allowed their virtues to be used as weapons against themselves.  Therefore, they will not allow the Dem’s to define the rules of engagement, e.g. “lawfare”.

                    I once made the mistake of discounting cowardice as conservatives’ primary motivator, but that was wrong as hell. Even as much as they love Our Greatest Ally, it give them the sadz to have to disagree with the Left, so they do so half-heartedly. If someone on the Right, hence a powerful person, speaks truth to power about Israel, the cons will rip their lungs out.
Conservatism failed as an ideology even more than Marxism.

                It would be very surprising if there is a red state AG/SecState/whatever who is willing to deal with the regime’s retaliation for taking Biden off the ballot. The lefties removing Trump don’t have to worry about that.

                I don’t see many Red states being willing to remove Biden but I will agree that the GOP is in a very tight spot that it probably cannot wriggle out of. The Republican Party, at the grassroots level anyway, **IS** Trump. There is just no party without Trump. The wealthy old GOP donor types who keep people like Miss Lindsey going don’t get this. They think they can stand up another drug store cowboy like GW Bush, play some country music, and the rubes will fall in line again. They won’t. They will back a third party headed by Trump, stay home, go RFK, or go with some other third party. The Republicans only real hope to survive is to *become* Trump’s third party. They need to become the TOP. I don’t think they can. The people controlling the purse-strings are too old, too out of touch, and often too fagged-out and degenerate themselves to make this change.

                I have not followed it much, so am a bit confused as to how Red states would remove Biden from the ballot.  From what I understand, the current fiasco is the GOP removing Trump from the GOP primary ballot.  Ostensibly, the GOP is controlled by “conservatives” but it seems in CO and ME, they are just liberals who like their coffee black or something (preferably from Black Rifle).  I do not see how liberal Democrats in “Red” states would have any incentive to remove Biden.  This is a political party primary ballot issue, from what I understand, not a “Red” state/ “Blue” state thing.  Or am I missing something?

                How much time do you spend alone?  You never complain about a woman nagging you.
On your podcasts you seem like a social guy but you appear to live like a monk.
Just curious.

                    Wild Geese:  Lots and lots of timber and water and wildlife . . . and not nearly so many people  . . . in the Ozarks (either Missouri or Arkansas).  I’d be wary of northeastern Oklahoma because of all the feather Indians and political (tax and zoning) influence they have there.
This all depends on where you are willing to move to.  We didn’t want to move out to the northwest, but we definitely wanted to stay west of the Mississippi.

                I spent the evening in bed listening to the fireworks go off in the wash behind the house.  Lasted until 1:00 or so.  Was not too annoyed and grateful that I had a field dog trained to ignore gunshot.
I spend a lot of time appreciating the lack of “Karens” in the neighborhood and the children being children without the hinderance of police calls and patrols.  I never had that freedom as a youngster.

                I turned on five minutes before 12 because my wife wanted the traditional ball drop. Two guys kissing, then she shrieks. Quick off then. Don’t have broadcast tv, youtube live feed.

            I do not see much happening on the China front this year. The empire has its hands full with the Ukraine debacle, the growing problems in the Middle East and domestic politics. China is not going to attack Taiwan, as it has its own domestic issue to address as it tries to develop a stronger domestic economy.

                    Taiwan—even under Biden regime—is busy moving to the USA.  We have a couple of their chip makers breaking ground in the Phx area.  They’re no dummies and are seeing the writing on the wall wrt China.  This will take some time, but it will be interesting to see if China attempts to head them off in the future.

                        I haven’t been paying real close attention, but have heard that Taiwan semiconductor has had trouble getting  quality Taiwanese workers to make the jump to AZ.  Better for Arizonans if they can find the right people here rather than importing more foreigners.

                        Has it occurred to you that if China *did* move on TW, the USA would immediately move to kill all the big brains at TSMC plus level the fabs so as to leave the PRC dust and ashes?TSMC is a football. Of course they have a bit more agency than a football… but it’s not as if it’s all fear of China which is driving them to build fabs in Arizona… it’s US blackmail. Does anybody serious THINK that the USA has the quality of people who can actually get the work done in these advanced facilities? Dream on! And does anybody think that the top 5% of pampered geniuses at TSMC who really grok the secret sauce required to make low nm fabs produce viable yields would suffer in PRC Akademgorodoks showered with high class hookers and gold bars? Operation Paperclip anybody?Instead they will have to live triple-taxed in gated communities in New Mexico and Arizona and be worried about Chimpouts and Cartels and forced to associate with Pajeets and HR Shaniquas and Karens. I’m sure they totally can’t wait to make the jump.It’s complicated.

                    The issue is that the Kagans might try to force Xi’s hand because scorpion &amp; frog. Doesn’t have to make any kind of geopolitical sense.But not in 2024 methinks. Too much other stuff going down. Things could get a bit flashpointy around late January 2025 though.Xi does have to look over his shoulder at mass domestic political opinion — especially when issues of national pride are involved.But otherwise, it’s a no-brainer for the Chinese to wait and let Taiwan fall into their lap at a later date as the Pax Americana fades away. They’ve read their Thucydides. And not just in translation… they have their own equivalents most of us have never heard of.
