        The three things everyone needs to know about the Cult (credit to my learned friend TC):1. The left is wrong about everything.2. The left lies about everything.3. Whatever they’re accusing their enemies of, rest assured it is something they themselves are most guilty of.

            Number 1 I can’t agree with because it was a few past successes that have led the Cult to believe they must be correct about EVERYTHING.
Numbers 2 and 3 are absolutely correct. That’s how to beat them, they are always telling lies and always projecting their insecurities.

        Did you see the article in NRO by David French dateline December 8th?I read it off Realclearpolitics.  It seems like a mash up of this post and the previous one about the “War on white”. Its so obvious it makes me think I must be mistaken.

        The Overton Window is splitting in two.  One window is on the right… the other on the left.  There is no acceptable middle ground in which to make policy and law.

            Could be. The gulf between me and people I used to think were generally on my side is getting wider. But, my descent into madness is probably the answer.

                Well, the guys down the hall are buying bullion coins in various denominations, I’m thinking about stockpiling food, and gun sales are through the roof.  Madness abounds.

        She added: “I cannot recall any historical precedent for denying immigration based on religion.”Really?  No, seriously — really?  I would invite Nancy Morawetz to read up on the history of the Know Nothing Party.  They were kind of a big deal in the 1840s and 50s – got a bunch of people elected, changed the whole conversation, folded into the Republican Party and helped it start the Civil War.  Important stuff, that we used to learn about back in junior high when this country had an education system.Or you can just watchGangs of New Yorkfor the tendentious Scorsese take on all of it.  Banning Catholics was the cornerstone issue of immigration reform for about 100 years, Nancy.  That they didn’t succeed doesn’t mean the didn’t try, election after election after election.

        No doubt in my mind Trump is watching what Cernovich, Milo and Heartiste are doing to the Cult and the Cucks. It is quite a spectacle to behold. They throw out silly exaggerations of real hate truths and wait for the ferals to jump in with the actual (but still shocking) numbers. Basically getting them to punch themselves in the face. They treat the cult like the spoilt bully-children they are, dragging them into the centre of attention, thrashing them and kicking them while they are down. All of the cult are liars and most are secret degenerates too. That all gets exposed and they have no idea how to reframe the wreckage. It’s beautiful.

        I should hate to see religion being the factor in sorting out immigration. Much better to ask the questions: “Are you a liar? Can we trust you to behave?”
Of course, the answers would be, inevitably, no and yes (though all death cult adherents would be stopped from entering after answering, purely on the basis of the first question obviously being an outright lie)

            Trump is being provocative. A religious test would be impractical, but unnecessary. Just end all immigration from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Iran, etc. Combined with the end of birth right citizenship, burden of proof for employment and welfare benefits and 90% of the immigration issues are addressed. We would still have some Muslims trying to sneak in through Mexico and Canada, but perfection is the enemy of the good enough.The inevitable hooting and hollering from the establishment should eventually be answered with a call to halt all immigration. That should be the compromise. “OK, we won’t put a religious or ethnic test, we’ll stop all immigration in order to safeguard the country.”

                Yeah. Trump is a wheeler-dealer. He makes a laughable opening offer, then negotiates down to 125-150% of what he wanted in the first place. Old time wheeling and dealing. See: Used Car Salesman”.

                Trump is not being merely provocative.  He is suggesting that we profile the people coming to live among us.  That was the way it was done up until the ‘diversity and multicultural’ era.  Besides Islam is a dangerous cult and does not qualify for religious protection under the 1st amendment.  Close the darned mosques and let the ‘religious’ cultists go to one of their 57 states.

                I was attempting to be somewhat sarcastic when I suggested that I would hate to see religion being a factor in immigration. But I wasn’t being at all sarcastic when I suggested the death cult adherents are encouraged to be liars, so getting the truth out of them would be impossible.

        “In a weird way, Trump is doing to the ruling class what Progressives have done to traditional Americans for fifty years. ”
This is the most important lesson from Trump. He is using their tactics and they don’t have an appropriate counter attack either.

        Ol’ Donald is making this stuff look easy.  There are so many things “you just shouldn’t say”, which actually are obvious truths or perfectly logical assumptions.  Trump is operating in a target-rich environment these days.

        Could be wrong, but didn’t the gomt restrict people of the Hebraic faith from entering the country, at least in the 30s. That’s without mentioning the many peoples of the Orient, banned by race rather than religion.  From the 1870s on, various prohibitions have occurred periodically.  Thank goodness, they allowed my Irish Catholic grandfather to immigrate.
