            I disagree. Covid (and BLM) were a turning point for many whites. They were caught off guard by both, but they’re ready this time. I’ve had several tell me that if something like that ever starts to happen again, that they’ll be up in arms immediately, ready to quit jobs, hit the streets and tell any white Lib or pushy black to fuc$ off.
And I believe them. I can see it in their eyes. They’re still very pissed off about all of that. It’s just under the surface.

                Not until the 401K racket has little or no power over them. Baby boomers are mostly worthless because of this, they have a golden calf on their phones, its called watching their 401k balance. Once the next generation or generations do not have much in the way of a financial stake in the current system then we can get somewhere. Progress takes place one funeral at a time.

                    I’m not saying that these normie whites would riot. I’m simply saying that they’d take a stand against lockdowns, vaccines and anti-white seminars are work.
They’re not ready for the French Revolution, but they have moved.

                        You may be right, there is some resistance building, i am down on my own baby boomer generation right now, Senator Tillis prime example, many boomers are just goobers who trust the system as it is currently. Watch the Mike Pence interview on CNN, Pence in my opinion is not an evil guy, just a baby boomer goober much like Tillis who cannot see anything but trust in his Constitution and the system built around it.

                            Yes Mr. Giddy, I understand. Boomer that I am, we had it good and I’m grateful. Never bought the collectivist mindset nor trusted the ruling overlords. And learned that socialism always runs out of other peoples’ money. My own husband, bless his little heart, has been captured by Charlie Kirk, the neocons and the Foos ZionPark-ists. No one around me can juggle 3 balls in the air. Back in the 80’s we were curious, we enjoyed thinking and exploring new ideas. Life was exciting and so interesting. I was so very curious about life. Now we live Black tile, white tile—let’s you and him fight. People are not curious about life anymore. People furiously fight to keep their eyes closed. The ruling overlords push us to choose sides and fight to get rid of us. Often there’s no sides to choose. Too many crazed people to pull out of this death spiral. Furries, trannies, people-cats who shit in cat boxes. Dog shit crazy. Will have to crash and the remnant will rebuild. People, even here in Mormon land, are so fucked up and mentally ill, it’s our own version of end of Rome. The Prophet told everyone to peck up, and by God they did. Consequences! We appear so spell bound and captured, the devices have spell bound us, as goofballs walk out upon the roads into traffic, oblivious. People here eat endlessly, obsessively, fill that black hole, to run to death. Even the ranchers have huge rancher guts. Mormon kids are now often rude, fat and sickly, both physically and mentally. Eat-Eat-Eat-Shit. The Malthusians may well succeed in getting rid of a lot of people. I fear the future landscape will look like a reenactment of Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, collapsed people-bugs in a ditch waving death twitch legs. However, there will be a remnant. I’m out of the way, not blocking the road, not telling youngers how to make their brave new world, encouraging the younger folks to fight for their future, have families and tribal up. The baton is passed to you. Do something with it. I got the good shift-swing shift is great. You get the end of the 4th turning graveyard shift. Beware of Resentment. It will eat your soul and destroy you.This too shall pass. Keep your head on a swivel. Be curious. Live!

                                This is very good.I’m beyond the point of any concern for AINO — it’s already gone beyond saving.  My main concern, perhaps only concern, is the Great Jeet Tsunami that Illegal Alien Elon and Vivjeet Ramaswampy enthusiastically chatted up a few month back, which Mr. Tangerine Man endorsed.While the theatrics about this were all removed from the kayfabe stage very soon after the performance, I do not believe for a second they’ve dropped this.  My gut instinct tells me this is a high priority and remains so, they’re quietly planning on this, and fully intend to ship in an enormous number of jeets, enough to jeopardize the future of the remnant, which I agree will emerge from even the present level of sickness (bad as it truly is) and can rebuild.If there’s one thing “out there” to stay engaged with it’s the illegal alien problem.  Shutting down all of it plus mass deportations of what’s already here seems important.  While this most likely still can’t save AINO, it will give the remnant a fighting chance, at least much better odds.

                    My wealth isn’t predominantly in any government-sponsored tax scheme like a 401k or magic stock market money. I’m not immune — the government can always fuck with you, tax you into penury, or outright take your wealth “for reasons,” but at least theoretically, what’s mine is mine.

                    You sound hopeful for it all to go belly up and usher another reset to come about. very marxist feel to this. Baby boomers are the least likely to see 401k devaluation as harmful to them as it is to Genx and younger. Most oldies I know have cashed out 401s and  the others are not going to welcome your silly prophecy.

                        “Very Marxist feel.” Why not go with “woke right,” James Lindsay? Keep trying. Ain’t working when all we hear is:“Hurr durr u r Marxist.”
People were pissing their pants just three weeks ago when the stonk market kept dipping lower and lower. I know you old folks have short memories, but we had veteran hippies and No Nukes losers from the 1980s out in the streets waving signs reading “HANDS OFF MY $$$ TRUMP.” I think you’re pretty worried.

                        One would move this conversation forward if one would simply speak in more generalized terms of *wealth*. The Boomer generation has much of the wealth, and that is locked up in housing and 401k’s—true. However, this is a *small* percentage of a 77M person cohort. Most retirees today—who are the Boomers—retire with perhaps $150-250k in *wealth* (all assets minus liabilities), depending whom you read.$250K is nothing, especially considering rising inflation. That the followup generations, X’ers, Millennials, Zoomer’s, etc are looking at a bleaker future accumulation of wealth bodes even worse.The problem today is a disparity in wealth among the populace. Myriad writings and graphs illustrate this disparity, which grew immensely during the 20th century and especially after the dot-com revolution. Basically, the top 20% of the populace has 80% of the wealth give or take.Further, it’s really the top 10% to worry about, if you look closely. Last I read you need $2M in wealth to enter the top 10% of the populace. You got that? Don’t for a moment think that the top 10% of the population—approximately 35M—are Boomers. It can’t be. That would be half of them, and as I said most retire with much less resources.This is why I consistently rail against those who decry the Boomers as having robbed future generations—it misses the point of wealth disparity among the populace. The Boomers dying off will do *nothing* to correct the wealth disparity in this nation.The middle class is what made this country unique and I maintain held it together through tough economic times and changing demographics. We are moving backward from such a distribution of wealth and into a former age of the wealthy and everyone else—aristocracy and the peasants—if you will. This is third world in nature and with such in place, we will resort to third world values.

That’s been the case as long as humans have been able to accumulate wealth, sometimes with a lot worse percentages than that. The alternative is the unproductive riding on the backs of the productive.

He asked the prosecution,  “isn’t it true that some condoms are made from lambs’ intestine?”
The prosecution conceded the point but the judge said he did not see what that had to do with the case.

                                Agreed. AFAIC, far more important than wealth inequality is overall standard of living. What do I care how much money Musk has so long as I’m financially secure and my standard of living isn’t deteriorating?
Now having said that, I’m a firm believer that personal wealth should be capped in some way. Men should not be richer than entire nations. Such a concentration of wealth confers far too much power, and it is apt to be used harmfully. But saying that is very different than arguing from the standpoint of class consciousness or personal envy.

                                    Good points.  I agree, but have no good solution as to the oligarchs we have produced.  I fear to become like the Leftists and scream for wealth confiscation and redistribution.  Seems it always comes to that—and even when so, it simply redistributes wealth to the unproductive and weakens us overall.
We need a productive and large middle class, which you and I are a part of as you note, to counterbalance the oligarchs we inevitably produce.  Somewhat that balance was lost.  It needs to be regained.

                                    Even when the middle class was healthier — we still have one — there was still great wealth inequality. That’s not the main problem. The problem is that the wrong people are getting enriched. Parasitic middlemen. Rootless cosmopolitans.

                                That is correct as far as it goes. What I would point out is that is recently as three or maybe even two generations ago it was possible for a man with an 8th grade education to work in a factory or similar full time and earn enough to support himself and a family and perhaps even buy a modest home. Those days are long gone probably since 1970 or so. That was likely the peak of economic prosperity, perhaps abnormally good by historical standards. The important lesson is that those days are long gone and they probably are never coming back.

                    AFAIK, most Boomers shouldn’t even have stocks. The oldest Boomers are 80 and the youngest in their 60s. Though interest on bonds are still low by historical standards, they ain’t zero anymore.  If you don’t need the money for 25 years, the volatility of the market isn’t that big a deal. Most don’t pay dividends, so you have to sell to get the benefit of a higher price.

                        One of the effects of the historically aberrant US stock market of the last 80 years or so has been to compress the perception of the time period of “markets always go up over time.” Such that 5-10 years is now considered long term investment, with minimal risk. Sooner or later folks will find out that’s mistaken.

                            After the crash of 29 the stock market didn’t recover until the 50’s.  But back then, if you failed, you were on your own.  Not so today.  People can’t understand that the stock market has been a larger recipient of welfare then probably any program created for the public since their inception.  And that is just since the year 2000.

                        The bond market is larger over all—way larger—than the stock market.  Bonds however have been taking on the chin due to government shenanigans.  The stock market is partially used to offset inflation for one’s limited portfolio.  It seems since the (after) Reagan years, that the tried and true admonition to “play it safe with bonds” is no longer valid.

                In other words, this is about survival now. It isn’t about survival in the sense of whether or not you will live an existence. It is about survival in the sense that you live within a system that openly promotes your extinction.
Those are the stakes and young men understand them. As the incoherency and the extent to which we have been stripped naked and left to our own becomes more apparent, the choices of those left to their own will be made. I see the same thing CoSC sees in the eyes of many young men.

                    Younger white men are far more ready to ditch the system than older white men. The older whites won’t put up with anything in the ballpark of Covid or BLM again but will generally stick with the system. Younger whites have zero loyalty to the system.

                        Sure.  Many older white men did well by the system and so stick with it.
The younger white men live under cultural pogrom, ongoing third-class status, behind females and of-colors.  The entire structure is against them and makes no secret of its hatred for them.

                        It’s as the Zman has said on a number of occasions. Risky behavior is one advantage the young have. They haven’t got as much to lose, and more to gain.

                                Yes, it’s true that youth tend to be the risk takers. But what they rarely consider is that they are gambling with  future life expectancy. From that perspective, for example it’s far more rational to take up skydiving as a hobby when you’re 89 then when you’re 19.

                    They’ll try, but there’s only a few ways to run a con. Once you’re looking for them, it’s tough to get away with the scam.
If anything, the next scam will involve the financial system. That’s a tougher one to protest. Who do you attack?

Why do you think they all gladly jumped on DEI?  They know they’re frauds, and they hope to convince the populace that that is ok.

                        Or random kill squads of south-of-the border types hitting various places in all fifty states all at once. Nothing would grind life in this country to a halt faster than that. Remember the DC snipers? No one went out unless they had to, now imagine these invaders getting a “go” signal; they take out repeater towers, as well as smaller power stations. No comms, police are in a panic as these same groups also attack their stations as well. They then move on to random neighborhoods, murdering people in their homes. Remember about ten days ago, state troopers stopped those mexican nationals in a van  containing 180k rounds of ammo? Gee, I wonder what of all is for? If I was going to throw the population at large a curve ball, that might be it.

                                If you want to sew civil disruption the resources would be far better used attacking infrastructure. Random killing may have its uses but it pales compared to a city-wide blackout or suchlike major utility outages. See Professor Betz’s interviews on YouTube for background.

                    Karp’s, “Digital Republic”, is what is on the docket next. You are and will continue to be surveilled online and increasingly in physical space. Whoever controls that apparatus will use it to chill and dispossess their enemies.We all have a digital dossier. You may never know that you are being liquidated. That dossier is shared with every institution and if you are outside of it, you never are permitted in. If you are inside and they don’t want you, you are quietly liquidated. Then, as you have no means to keep your roof over your head, they buy your assets for pennies on the dollar or open them for bidding by foreign capital.Of course, like the Praetorian guard and the federated legions, it will devolve into intrigue and in-fighting for control over the apparatus of the tyranny. It could be that you don’t even have to be a political enemy on some policy or ideological grounds. You could just have something they want and become owning nothing and arm-twisted into being happy.This outcome is a distinct possibility. That doesn’t mean it will be final.One thing to point out is this is why White identity politics must emerge in an explicit form and it must emerge soon. At some point Trump and Con Inc. hiding behind diversity and hiding behind anti anti-semitism cannot be acceptable to Whites. The reason is simple. In this type of system, the people who can be isolated and picked off one by one are going to get savaged. If we do not find our voice and assert it without apology, then it is a bleak situation.However, if we do find our voice and assert our interests as the plurality then we are okay. Success in this coming age will require:Cultivating ourselves and our young as part of the cognitive elitePlaying an essential role in commanding the intellectual and physical resourcesMaintaining a vital and leadership role in the sanctioned enforcement and violence apparatus of the state and a large presence within itAn organized, multi-layer folk network  and patrimony system and developed mechanisms of verifying trust.Developing the will and fortitude to assert ourselves as the group on this continent that will not be consigned to last place and that is ready to be first.Make ourselves essential. Make ourselves owners. Make ourselves resilient. Make ourselves always the top contender to control the apparatus.That apparatus is being built and deployed whether we like it or not. We should like being the ones in control of it and never satisfied with not being that faction. It is sad that this is what life in North America is going to become. We chose being left alone in affluence and we got jumped and savaged. We should embrace this fate as it means we can redeem ourselves if we reclaim ourselves as post-modern Vikings.

                        The only word I’ve never heard Trump say is “white.” He’ll spew out garbage over pencils and baby dolls for children, whatever comes into his head, but the idea of Trump thinking about “white people” is a fantasy. This is a Boomer who spent his career under an ideological regime that told him he was a good and progressive person for hiring minorities and women, and being a hard-ass on young white guys.Some may recall an incident on The Apprentice when a young fella’ made the mistake of referring to himself as “white trash.” Trump fired him on the spot, but it wasn’t the “white” part that bothered Trump, but the guy’s description of himself as “trash.” If that guy had said “white strength” Trump would’ve canned him as well. You cannot escape when all of the exits have been mentally closed to you by the generations above you and they will not listen to your critique. It’s still America 1982 in Trump’s head and, I’m sorry, no one’s moving me off that position.

                            Hi Arthur –We fundamentally agree. I don’t think Trump is a bad guy or against us. He is just a child of his generation and a product of his experience.My point was not to build all that dependent upon Trump. Trump is just opening space for what comes next. It is up to Whites to use that space to build what I described. That should not be dependent upon getting the right politician in place. That should be dependent on nothing but organizing so that we are prepared to thrive in the environment that is already here – organized ethnic blocks in a zero sum game of control over North America.That is orthogonal to Trump and damn sure is not and cannot be dependent upon him.The only politics we should be doing right now is local politics and mobilizing en masse to make sure that Vivek does not become governor of Ohio. Trassel must become governor. To have what should be an American fortress get turned over to Vivek at this stage is a disaster that we cannot countenance.I think mobilizing as a people to take and hold Ohio is both a tactical win to take it and will result in building the foundation of what I described above.God bless you and your family.

                                A similar battle should be taking place in Kentucky within the Republican party. The guy they ran for governor is running for McConnel’s seat. He is just another like the judge who lowered Anthony’s bail. Even if the ‘Pubs lose the Senate in Kentucky, it is better that that AA mask not win. We can rally and retake that seat at a later time. Not sure how to do that, but it is another battle.

                        The problem with “liquidating” people is that suddenly they don’t have anything to lose. So you either have to do it very, very selectively, such that the vast majority remains safe from it, or else, if you do it at scale and rapidly, you have to accept large risks.

                        Absolutely. This will be our ‘ Century of Humiliation ‘ to use the Chinese term. The Euro tribes will re-discover our barbarian DNA and evolve back to our earlier, simpler, more loyal in high integrity selves. Then things will be changed by us. Just read Kipling’s ” The Beginnings” ten times, then go away and memorize it and say it every day.

                Yes. I have been shocked by the amount of formerly submerged seething that has risen to the surface lately. If the jabs resulted in numerous fatalities, there would be an absolute uprising, but vaccine deaths have nowhere reached that point. As it is, there is what amounts to a bitter Cold War between the Dirts and the Clouds now. As long as they are warm and fed, people will be placated generally, but if the Covid playbook were run again it would cause a straight-up revolt. I agreed with karl von until just recently, too, but although it took a long time, people are furious and venting anger now. Formerly suppressed rage is the most potentially violent rage.Mass migration is following a similar pattern. Britain in particular is pushing the envelop there. It is interesting to note that in Canada the globalist Carney made noises about limiting migration and got elected. So far it seems to be mostly empty rhetoric but it was telling when he got to the right of the emasculated Conservative on this issue. I actually think migration still has the potential as a cataclysmic flashpoint even without an economic collapse but that issue, too, has settled into Cold War.

                    Yes. You see it in people getting pissed when some blue-haired Lefty or some magic negro tries to use their magic words on whites. Whites don’t just ignore it; they tell them to fuc$ off.
There’s a lot of anger out there over Covid and BLM – and it’s not going away.

                        Good on you to include BLM since that also produced a lot of rage that is starting to surface only now. Attempts to contain anger over blacks and mass migration, which is a third source of rage, are coming up short.

                    “If the jabs resulted in numerous fatalities, there would be an absolute uprising,”Define numerous.  I maintain we have numerous deaths as compared to what we previously defined as unacceptable—except that these deaths were not immediate (as you and I would understand) and they are from multiple, seemingly unrelated causation.What is currently under examination in many Western nations is the unexplained “all causes” death rate increases post vaccine introduction.  This bears watching.  That there are increases in the “all cause” death rate and the timing of such (post vaccination introduction) is a pretty solid finding.  Now linking such to death cause and vaccine adverse effects is in progress.  This of course will be resisted by the powers that be in the industry.

                        Because by a fluke one of them “caught it early” and didn’t just die in her twenties, I recently got to hear a group of young people I know talk about colon cancer. These are far-above-average whites and Asians who in prior generations would have been innovative rising leaders of their fields, embodiments of progress. Instead, they kind of don’t do anything. They’re just old enough to not be “promising” anymore.A fate they’ve all accepted, without explanation, is that surprise fatal cancersjust happennow, to younger and younger people—that’s justhow it is, they’ve heard—and that getting a colonoscopy before you’re 50, even if you’ve been bleeding out the ass for years, is nearly impossible, so…oh well.When people are truly immiserated (and/or demoralized and/or deracinated, as /ourguys/ prefer), they do not rebel. They meekly die. If you handed them a list of the people who are killing them and said “You are free; this is yours to do with as you will,” they’d avert their eyes so they don’t accidentally read any names on it while they throw it away.Accelerationists, even of the mildest “wait til the EBT cards don’t work” or “when this particular number stops going up,look out” sort, do not understand people. Our rulers do.We have the “Epstein client list,” for example. The news for years has been the public assembly of it. We all have it in our minds. Nobody on it has anything to worry about.They know.

                            About 6 years ago, an uninsured colonoscopy cost less than 3 grand out of pocket. I oughtta know. My conclusion is that if someone doesn’t get one, they either don’t want one, or they are abjectly poor with no prospects of ever getting that “huge” sum together, which in AINO today seems kind of far fetched.

                                I have been researching that topic in the past month or so because my primary says it’s time for my next screening. I was being tested for other things in my 30s and they found polyps. I’ve had two colonoscopies since then. Both were negative. Polyps sounds scary but well over half the population has them by the time they’re in their fifties. I also found in a government report that while  screening is highly recommended, to my surprise the report said it would extend one’s life by about 120 days, roughly 1%. I’m willing to consider non-invasive diagnostics but I’m saying “no thank you” to any invasive diagnostic in the future even if insurance pays for all of it unless there’s a damned good reason.Download JAMA paper if you want the background.https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening

                I wish I saw this.  Instead all I see are people telling me that we need to “voat harder” and make sure the “dems” don’t get back in!  “And even if they do, I’ll still get up every day and go to work because I have principles!”.  There’s only one solution and we all know what that is. And understandably it is not something considered by normie.  To make that leap is to sacrifice all that you have because there is no going back. Given the choice they’d rather have their weed, porn and video games. Actually being free is not a desired trait.

                    Largely agree with you tired – but you can’t expect too much from people.  The commentariat here is generally older and financially stable, and their viewsreflect that.  They may not be ‘clouds,’ but they had ‘careers’ and have ‘investments.’  Average Whites today can no longer depend on either.  Most here are accustomed to working within the system they’ve known their whole lives, while I’m doing my best to stay out of it.  I don’t want to deal with bankers or bureaucrats, I don’t want my name in their systems andrecords.  I don’t plan to live to 95 and trust in some paid alien to wipe my backside.

                The Covid response is more easily understood as the last/final bastion to be scaled wrt governmental authoritative credibility.  That is to say, the people by and large respected the authority and credibility of the national health care system.  Yes, we bitched about health care costs and insurance for decades, but always considered the CDC, NIH, HHS, etc to have our best interests at heart outside of the politics of the day. The doctors and scientists within these organizations were considered non-political with the sole, altruistic goal of protecting our health.  Those skeptics of the system were marginalized for the most part and considered “quacks”.Covid taught us better.  First, we saw a confusion wrt the disease and its effects/mortality.  Next, we saw panicked and ineffective proscriptions for prevention of disease spread and treatment.  These proscriptions caused more pain and suffering than the disease itself.  Since this disease was a world-wide pandemic, even the lowliest of dirt people were brought into the farce.The people caught wise and the skeptics/quacks/outcastes are now in ascendency, e.g., Kennedy.  Once credibility is lost—and rightfully so—there is no going back. The mendacity of our (former) medical authorities and their monetary relationship to their pharmaceutical company overloads is being revealed. As I write, many State legislatures are currently crafting, or have passed, laws controlling governmental responses toward the “next” scamdemic to come about.  Bird flu signaling is of little interest to the masses for example.  Once burned, twice shy.I’m of two minds here.  The above is not all to the good.  What it means is that the next pandemic to come about will *not* be prevented or ameliorated as far as is technically possible, but rather treated after the fact as it is shown to be real and people become largely infected and the disease endemic. This is a step backwards to the days when we knew nothing about disease prevention.

                    I agree with you until the last paragraph:  “What it means is that the next pandemic to come about will *not* be prevented or ameliorated as far as is technically possible, but rather treated after the fact as it is shown to be real and people become largely infected and the disease endemic.”
What pandemic did we have before covid?  None in my lifetime.  And i’d say AIDS was a scare tactic.  I’ve never even met anyone in my entire life with AIDS.  It’s all bullshit, we’re just witnessing the unraveling.

                        You’ve never met anyone with AIDS because you are not in those classes of AIDS victims.  You are not a homo, or drug user.  Simple as that.  This means nothing that you’ve not experienced a major outbreak of a crippling disease.  Albeit such infection is voluntary in nature.Thanks to vaccines and wide spread information and vaccination movements, we no longer have polio.  But my parents remember such major outbreaks.  Indeed, my cousin caught polio as a young child and was paralyze by it.  I’ve seen the picture and seen the lasting results of her infection.My grandfather was caught in the great flu pandemic of 1918.  As a young man in the merchant marine, he caught the flu aboard ship along with the other men in his age range—early 20’s.  No medicine was available, only quarantine in the mess.  He was placed in a makeshift bed between two other young men.  After a rough night he awoke in the morning and the two other sailors in the adjacent beds were gone—both had passed away in the night.  Such was the disease and the startling result with young adults.  Yet the very young and very old survived.

                                Sanitation actually made polio worse by reducing childhood exposure and therefore resistance, when adult cases have a much higher incidence of paralysis and death. Modern sanitation practices were commonplace for many decades before major outbreaks, not all of them urban, ceased with widespread introduction of the vaccine.

If I can put in a public service  announcement and not for vaccination it is this: improved food safety and water and sewage treatment take most of the credit for disease mitigation since 18th century.

                        The response to the disease was ill advised and in that many more deaths occurred than would be expected if nothing was done, except standard “cold care”.  I’m with you there.
For the claim of murder, one assume intent—or at least gross negligence or malfeasance.  This might have occurred, indeed I’d argue that it did occur, in specific aspects of the fiasco.
However, it’s a broad brush you paint with that needs more specificity.  So I will not agree with your simplistic comment: “Covid was murder”.
if you want an argument, elaborate.

                                Drinking and bad food products=Covid=murder is a bit too much of a stretch.  Checking old Covid recovering people out of hospitals and into rest homes classifies as gross negligence.  Unfortunately, fools like Cuomo who commanded such and more—like respirator care—will never pay the price.  Indeed, he’s on his way to be NYC Mayor.

The ever increasing numbers of women in science and medicine guaranteed that a crisis of credibility would ensue. Anything women dominate ceases to be taken seriously – even by women themselves. Women seldom have the self-confidence (you might call it “balls”) to resist whatever the fashionable groupthink is in their field even when the foundational principles of the field itself require high standards of evidence and skepticism of outlandish claims. The same thing is now happening to law and the courts.

                Disease caused by microorganisms that one cannot see activate a reason-shackling threat perception response deep in our hindbrains. Threats perceived to come from other humans are an entirely different matter. When those humans are easily classified as ‘other’ either genetically or memetically (culture/behaviors), and when the threats they pose are seen as existential, then an entirely different (instinctive) behavioral response results. This is how pogroms happen.

                        People do say that. We should doubt it.I don’t meanackchyuallyit away. Hawaiians or Samoans or somebody near there probably does have an ancient tradition of universal obesity. I doubt that the average Aztec just recently became a spherical goblin.What I mean is: It’s a “right-wing” thing that you’re allowed to say. There aren’t many of those. And they’re all thematically linked. You can say poor people are fat, that lottery winners go broke (they don’t), that wages cause inflation (they don’t), etc.There’s a feeling that saying these things gives you.They want you to feel it.

                            I wasn’t speaking of tribes possessing genetic tendencies to endomorphism. I was speaking to the fact that throughout history dire poverty manifests as malnutrition and even starvation. That is decidedly not the case in postwar America/AINO where the poorest people still manage to ingest enough garbage to make themselves look like walruses, albeit not quite so cute.

                Yep. France was boiling for a century before the Bastille was stormed. Despite the anger and frustration of the hoi polloi, it was the 1788 bad harvest and subsequent bread shortages that kicked things off. People right now are still like Wily Coyote: barrelling forward with life, not realising that the cliff edge is behind them. However, there is no avoiding the final cataclysm coming our way. There was just a chance that a Hero figure on a white horse like Trump (yeah, yeah, I know) might stave off disaster for another half century, but that chance has gone. Oh, and as a little post-chaser to my thoughts,  the US has just passed another milestone of terminal decline: the amount it spends on debt servicing is now more than what it spends on defence. No empire has ever survived that statistic.

            Covid didn’t trigger a general rebellion as it should have done. However, I can’t help thinking that it changed something irrevocably in our trajectory. Pardon the pun, but it ripped the mask off our “elites” and showed us what they really are. I remain hopeful. These people are as stupid, arrogant and inflexible as the French aristocrats were up till midnight on 13th July 1789.

        Since the end of the Second World War, the West did not have much in the way of politics, because everyone agreed on the important moral questions.
One of the more unsettling things for me is the slow realization that I was lied-to about those post-WW 2 moral questions.

            Unfortunately, the legal immigration and the desire to bring in foreign capital that brings in new economic elites who are alien and often hostile is the lynchpin. We just saw a tag team of that in action.Mayorkas dumps and selectively distributes tens of millions of settler colonists throughout the countryside and small cities. He cites that this is a, “broad and general set of guidelines”, to make it happen. Talawi sits as the judge and decrees that 400,000 of these invaders all need their own trial. Mayorkas the tired, the poor, the hungry, the refugee came here and went straight to Beverly Hills to nurture his treason. Talawi came here and went to top honors at UC Berkeley to nurture here treason. Obama appointed both of them and we know his alien origins.Your list is good and fine. In a High-Low pincer move you cannot win without someday going to war on the high. This is the weakness of Trump the merchant, and JD Vance has in-laws who are anti-White alien elites entrenched at UC San Diego.Perhaps the path forward for Americans is to do their own high low. Perhaps some alliance can and will be forged to siphon off some segment of their low.Good list. In the end, Z-Man’s analysis is, in my opinion, correct.

                All roads lead to these things as a start. I doubt we will get to any of it. The idea of a white homeland looks to be the only way to accomplish anything. Riding the wave of current events with the players we have I don’t see anything changing for the better. The west is going through a metamorphosis. What will it become? Government is a service. Let legitimate purpose in enumerated powers be the driving force in Government. Operationally the idea of the states with a federal partnership could work. Over time unfortunately the US has become the USSA. I just want to be free to ride my machine and not be hassled by the man. Maybe that’s what the West will become to some extent. What should be could be. What that will be remains to be seen. We are not the same. We are not equal. They are not like us.

        Will be interesting to see what happens if Trump fails and Vance isn’t elected in 2028. That would mark the end of any hope in reforming the system. (Hint: It can’t be reformed, but normies don’t know that.) What will normie whites do?
OTOH, the very few liberals that I am forced to interact with also seem at a loss. Yes, they hate normie whites, but outside of that, they have no vision for the future. Ironically, they are the conservatives, wishing to go back to 2014 and never leave.

                    For better or worse, I define Traditional America as White European/Roman Empire lands diaspora, black and indigenous (Indians-feather). I’m okay with going back to that kind of makeup, but good luck reversing the damage.
I go back and forth on the Hispanic. This country had a lot of land with indigenous Spanishish populations. I guess they are also Traditional America. (Puerto Rico, Guam, the Western States, etc.)
Not too keen on the growing Asian and African component, however.

                Once AINO’s political collapse begins in earnest, and autonomous polities begin forming, my prediction is the primary organizational dynamic will be rural vs. urban, which will be roughly coterminous with white vs. wog. Thus, the wogs and the Spiteful Mutants will form city-states, i.e. greater Chicongo, and the whites will create rural polities, i.e. downstate Illinois, athough these polities won’t have to respect existing state lines.

                The problem with the above is that 1) a great migration will be necessary because none of these states is more than 50% the labeled “ethno”, and 2) these ethnostates when created will be “failed” States shortly after creation. One need only to examine their related countries of population/ethnic origin to see this.  America does not contain “magic dirt”.

        People are still arguing about political principles, emphasis and nuance on a party basis. It’s far too late for such debates. The range of threats to Britain’s future is much wider than even during the Second World War because it includes irreversible social, cultural and demographic changes.

        “In the United States, this meant that the two parties agreed on all the major items like dealing with the Russians but had different approaches to the same goal.”—–What’s to deal with anymore? Back in the last century, there was a broad consensus that communism was a menace to our way of life. The current situation sounds more like the case of a government initiative that no longer serves a useful purpose, scraping around for ways to perpetuate it’s existence. Like the washboard inspector trying to keep his job.I’m not saying the Russians are good, but being enlightened to the fact that we aren’t either, whatever the deficiencies in their behavior, it’s hard to blame them given the way our Jewish-run foreign policy tries to bully everybody.

                I agree with one caveat. Since we were a nation of European diaspora, I don’t know that I have a problem with maintaining close ties to our various motherlands. But since the government decided that this was going to become a third world dump, I don’t know that this is tenable anymore.

                Agreed. And the military’s posture and capabilities should be overwhelmingly defensive. That would mean, among other things, abandoning NATO, shuttering all BFE military bases around the planet, and returning all military personnel stateside. Of course, if Trump tried to do this he’d be Kennedyed in a New York minute.

                    Getting out of NATO is paramount. So is shutting down the American Empire. Let the US worry about North America if it feels it needs to worry about something. Trump is in danger even if he doesn’t shut down the military industrial complex/empire. Regardless it’s highly unlikely he will be able to accomplish all that needs to be done.

They see the people as weak and contemptible for not doing what they should, in response to the elites’Reeks.  Wreaks is what you should be doing.American men are ruled by their inferiors: weak, colluding men and empowered, incompetent princesses.  A plutocratic gynarchy.‘As for my people children are their oppressors, and women rule over them’.  (Isaiah 3:12)White men are divided because some are weak, ignoble men and some are enablers, funders, and enforcers of the princesses.  Cops, corporation execs, politicians, leading men in the bureaucracy fit this bill.  America was wealthy a long time before her streets filled up with men.Your people are divided between vichy men and men separating from the system, voluntarily or otherwise.  Many of the elder men who should be leaders are comfortable from life in an America that no longer exists, and are indisposed to ‘doing what they should’, as the OP puts it.

        Back when China prospered, western Elites decided the Chinese wise man/expert Central Committee model was better than messy democracy. We all can recall Tom Friedman’s book/op-eds. It’s “Government without Feedback”. The crucial assumption is the ruling Elites are competent enough such that no feedback from Dirts (or even the bond market, which has been nationalized everywhere) is necessary. After 20 years of failure, it’s now obvious this doesn’t work. The Dirt revolt is a logical consequence. So they clamp down on democracy and feedback even harder. Reform will come after total system failure.

            I argue China is not an example of a failed system any more than the present USA is an example of a failed system—which it is.  I’d rather work on improving the China experiment than the American experiment.  I’d expect more success.

        I would also argue that the post-WWII model faced financial challenges in the 70s, and then a consensus decision was made to sustain it with debt.  When Soviet Union disintegrated, politicians felt vindicated about their decision to sustain the model with debt. As a result, the amount of debt injection grew exponentially over time.
That is what is causing the current crisis. European leader class, and to some extent Americans, feel that taking over Russian resources is the only way to maintain their current debt trajectory.

            I agree 100%, but i think the switch to debt had to do more with a loss of cheap energy.  It is what makes our entire civilization possible.  The cheap debt lost its magic in 08, and that is why green and gender bullshit started to be parroted in overdrive in the 2010’s.  They’re trying to get people to accept a very reduced standard of living by telling them its for a good cause (which is bullshit).  Like the church selling indulgences during medieval times to “forgive” your sins.

        With the US as the “big brother”, the snotty nosed European “little brother” can no longer run his mouth since big brother isn’t going to help protect him anymore. And about time too.Germany and France talking about going toe to toe with Russia is a good way to get their asses handed to them. They didn’t care when energy prices went through the roof but the tax payers sure did. And now the Euro elites think they can “rebuild” a military that never existed out of thin air and go up against Russia and possibly China backing them.I’m not sure exactly which industry is going to build all those systems given we’re in a contracting economy and have deindustrialized ourselves to the point we can’t even make the IC chips we’d need to manage the computer systems these systems require.I wonder if the morons in charge have noticed, but no one under the age of 45 is running to the recruiters office to sign-up despite the obvious advertising campaign with Bundeswehr posters on bus stops and train stations all over Germany. Oddly, none of the millions of new ‘diverse’ citizens seem interested in signing up either.It would seem the ruling elites didn’t get the memo that 100% of all military vehicles burn fossil fuels which is bad for Mother Earth and can lead to climate change. But somehow a possible nuclear war is fine. I can’t wait for the ‘stop oil’ protestors to have a sit-down on the flight lines while Eurofighters and F-35s are backed up on the taxi way.When the plebs fail to vote the way the elites want, there’s nothing like a good old fashioned war to get them back in line. To be fair, Europe needs a serious ass kicking anyway. It’s been long time coming.

        The Europeans have been given no relief valve whatsoever. They don’t even have fake opposition like the Republican party. Even the fake and literally gay opposition like the AfD are now in the process of being banned. I don’t know what this will translate to. They’ve managed to put out a lot of populist fires over the past 10 years but it isn’t stopping and I don’t know if they think they’re doing a good job or they are fighting a losing battle.Obviously, for now, we still have that relief valve but I suspect, not for long. When and if President Ocasio-Cortez enters the White House, they will go hard with extreme censorship and banning of political candidates. They’ll purge the FBI of anyone who worked with the Trump admin and make sure it is fully stocked with NKVD-types who hate the American people.

        The Western consensus was a moral consensus, which means the politics within the consensus were performative
I have a hard time believing this.  The morality aspect is an after the fact rationalization. The managerial elite is nothing if not compliant.  They change their ‘deeply held beliefs’ literally overnight.  We saw it with Covid, we saw it with trannies and we saw it with gay marriage and other examples.

            I assume Z was speaking more broadly, i.e. fighting global communism was the moral consensus during the Cold War, and group hyper-egalitarianism is the moral consensus of postmodernity. The elites definitely shilly-shallied on specific issues, as you point out, but remained fairly constant regarding the bigger picture.

        A Catholic school in Treviso sent all of the kindergartners to a mosque. They were welcomed by the Immam and then proceeded to kneel and bow their heads to the ground facing Mecca. The school board disavowed responsibility saying this was a choice by an individual school. The parents apparently approved of this visit ahead of time. It isn’t clear if they knew what it would entail.Lega Nord is renouncing this. At some point, the enemies within, a bigger liability than those without, will have to be dealt with by some other means than finger wagging and media outrage. They cannot be allowed to surrender everyone on behalf of themselves.

        Trump was elected to save the system by people who still believe in it. The tariffs he has supported are intended to repatriate the economy and will do so given time. Meanwhile, there will be pain. As Z Man noted, voters tend to vote with their pocketbooks. If they are not willing to put up with the pain, Trump and his political supporters will be replaced by the same old crowd that got us in this mess. Then the fur will fly and we shall see if these predictions of secession and white ethnostates are wishful thinking or inspired prediction. I don’t think it can be done peacefully.

            You can’t possibly believe that tens of millions of Americans are going to start making shoes and yoga pants and backpacks in factories at $25/30 an hour. Do you?
The factories will be almost entirely automated. You need to think more about this. You are wishing and hoping and dreaming of things that can no longer happen.

                There will be a lot of automation but very few facilities can really run lights-out.  It “can” be done but is still a very capital intensive affair that isn’t a no-brainer to justify.It will never look like the 1950s again, but manufacturing engineers, maintenance techs, some machine operators or material handlers, etc will be unavoidable.   Then there’s the office staff.  Also, expansion of the local supply base for raw materials to feed those largely-automated facilities.In the end it must happen, one way or another.  It’s impossible for the US to maintain the current SOP forever.  Services and airplanes aren’t ours by some divine right.  It’s only a matter of time before the more profitable white collar gigs are also picked off by lower cost competitors.  Autarky should always be the goal.

        If you’ve got a sufficient hold on power such that you can’t be voted out (which they do), and you are able to make Line Go Up in perpetuity (which they have been), then why change anything? They can’t possibly doubt their ability to do the former, since it is absolute, so it must be their ability to do the latter which they doubt. They must doubt it, or they would not be pursuing things like the Digital Panopticon/CBDC, which are not merely figments of DR imagination.The DP has been in implementation at least as far back as the introduction of passports(a temporary emergency measure)during WW1, the question is fast or slow, and if fast then why? Because fast brings risks. They should be able to go slow and eventually get there, no problem, but for some unknown reason(s) there appears to be a rush, coalescing around “2030.” Of course it is impossible (from the outside) to guess what psyops they might employ, since they are not bound by any scruples or any truth. But the observable thing is that they appear to be in a hurry. For some reason.

            On a personal level? I’m responsible for how you vote or how George Soros contributes money to a plethora of NGOs in Washington?When you look at the sheer volume of money which flows into, say, Belgian politics from NGOs ,corporations, and foreign intelligence agencies do you not think it absurd to expect a working-class Belgian to take personal ownership of the effects of this process?How does USAID money pouring into Brussels not change the relationship some dude in Charleroi has with the political system? If the system becomes increasingly opaque and materially disassociated from Belgians then how can we say he is as responsible for the government as previous generations were?

Much more right-wing, too, I’d say. Much more elitist, more self-confident— and importantly, much more willing to prove it.No sense making excuses. Don’t like quoting Yoda, but do or do not, there is no try.I just don’t see people backing up their complaining, and as someone who, at the least, put his livelihood on the line in the plague years, it rubs me the wrong way.

        AUGUSTINE: Therefore, if a people is well-ordered and serious-minded, and carefully watches over the common good, and everyone in it values private affairs less than the public interest, is it not right to enact a law that allows this people to choose their own magistrates to look after their interest—that is, the public interest?EVODIUS: It is quite right.AUGUSTINE: But suppose that the same people becomes gradually depraved. They come to prefer private interest to the public good.Votes are bought and sold. Corrupted by those who covet honors, they hand over power to wicked and profligate men. In such case would it not be right for a good and powerful man lif one could be found) to take from this people the power of conferring honors and to limit it to the discretion of a few good people, or even to one?EVODIUS: Yes, it would.

            Exactly.  The assumption is that all people are equal!  In the above case, equally virtuous—and that being so, should have a say in the society’s direction and function.  This has never been the case, so we immediately revert to Augustine’s alternative—rule by the few virtuous that any society produces *and* can be *idenitified*!So we immediately jump to the (missing) third point in the dialogue—how to identify the virtuous of the populace and allow them to “rule” their society.  So far we’ve not even attempted to do such, albeit we were arguably in better hands/understanding immediately following the creation of our Republic before “equality” was the overwhelming delusion of the land.

                The trend now is to divest the virtuous of any governmental say-so and transfer electoral swat to the fiends, finks, freeloaders and felons. Ergo, the worse conditions become, the more power is handed to those who made things worse. The very opposite of Augustine’s postulate.

        Colorado has historically been one of the best run dem states and still is – but they might pass a bill that would effectively abolish any limit for gender treatment (HRT/GCS).
Obviously it sounds crazy but is it metaphorically a cat marking its territory and saying “stay away” and in this case “stay away republicans”. In the 90s, Colorado had a lot of migration to the state that was republicans from Southern California who worked in the defense industry. Is this an attempt to say, “don’t come here”?

        EVODIUS: You’re right; it can’t be denied that we have a will. Do go on—let’s see what you deduce from that fact.AUGUSTINE: I shall. But first tell me whether you think you have a good will.EVODIUS: What is a good will?AUGUSTINE: It is a will by which we desire to live upright and honorable lives and to attain the highest wisdom. So just ask yourself: Do you desire an upright and honorable life and fervently will to be wise? And is it indisputable that when we will these things, we have a good will?EVODIUS: My answer to both questions is yes. I now admit that I have not just a will, but a good will.AUGUSTINE: How highly do you value this will? You surely do not think it should be compared with wealth or honors or physical pleasures, or even all of these together.EVODIUS: God forbid such wicked madness!AUGUSTINE: Then should we not rejoice a little that we have something in our souls-this very thing that I call a good will— in comparison with which those things we mentioned are utterly worthless, things that a great many human beings will spare no effort and shirk no danger to obtain?EVODIUS: Indeed, we should rejoice greatly.

            “Stormwater Hydrology and the Mathematics of Unlikely EventsI’m not a writer by trade. I’m a stormwater hydrologist, and in my opinion, a pretty good one. Hydrology is the science of tracking water as it moves through the water cycle, from ocean evaporation through cloud formation, precipitation, groundwater infiltration, runoff, evapotranspiration, riverine hydraulics, and the time series behavior of reservoirs.”Hoo-boy.  You can tell, this one is going to be interesting.  Thanks, JaG!I was catching up on the background of both the fall of Russia and a bit on the Jeet War of “towels versus bowels.”First, the UK and probably US are going to see a massive influx of Pajeet refugees.Second, Russia demonstrates why the conservatives will always get their triumphal capitalism propaganda wrong:  they assume that capitalismassureslegality, that is, legal process.It didn’t in Russia with the rise of the homegrown oligarchs, who had USAID and Harvard organizing their privatization of SOEs, state organized enterprises.
