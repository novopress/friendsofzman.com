        It’s Charleston, not Charles Town. Since it appears you are moving or have moved to WV, it would probably be good to get the name of the state capital and the state’s most populous city correct.

        “ The guy who decided to put a housing development in your town gets to keep all the money while the people living with his choices get to pretend it is their fault. ”
Monetizing “social capital”, then selling it.  This concept first reveled to me by none other than Z-man, here in this form a number of years ago.  Odd however, in all my discussions with others concerning this phenomenon, it still rings fresh to most people, and Z-man you’ll be pleased to know strikes them as astonishingly prescient as it once did to me.

            A great song, Mr. Spengler.
Here is a live version that I particularly favor. The lead guitarist outdoes himself.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LySTISqaH9o“Farm on the Freeway” by Jethro TullNine miles of two-strand topped with barbed wireLaid by the father for the son.Good shelter down there on the valley floor,Down by where the sweet stream run.Now they might give me compensationThat’s not what I’m chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday.Now all I have got is a cheque and a pickup truck.I left my farm on the freeway.They’re busy building airports on the south sideSilicon chip factory on the east.And the big road’s pushing through along the valley floor.Hot machine pouring six lanes at the very least.They say they gave me compensationThat’s not what I’m chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday.Now all I have left is a broken-down pickup truck.Looks like my farm is a freeway.They forgot they told us what this old land was for.Grow two tons the acre, boy, between the stones.This was no Southfork, it was no Ponderosa.But it was the place that I called home.They say they gave me compensationThat’s not what I’m chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday.And what do I want with a million dollars and a pickup truck?!When I left my farm under the freeway.

The real, historical Jethro Tull, for whom the band was named, was an expert agronomist in his time.

        Coming out of the covid lockdowns my red state county of 100,000 people has become targeted by Wall Street investors who have become bored with stocks and bonds and have decided to become national scale slum lords. There are are currently 6,000 apartment units under construction. The former farmland the next road over from my house will soon have 2000 residents and a new shopping center. If it was being built for locals it would be easier to accept but we are currently being inundated with Californians and border jumpers. My county voted 70% for Trump in 2020 so I am sure that a factor. This is a Heritage American stronghold and TPTB are definitely trying to weaken it by increasing political and ethnic diversity.

            This seems to be the story all over the red parts of my state. If its not housing for undesirables it’s solar farms. Its enough to make a man pray for collapse just so the traffic goes away.

        I live in Michigan and the witch in charge and our democratically elected (sarc) legislature just took over the ability to decide where windmills and solar farms can be located, all local decisions be damned. Since I live in a rural area (not hard in Michigan, about 80% of the state is covered with lakes and forests) no one voted for this, but it doesn’t matter. Maybe making the cost of construction prohibitive due to workplace accidents is our only way of voting at this point.

            Yes. However, Congress never held a single hearing investigating anti-white libels. The worst of all is Blake Masters’ latest campaign ad. He seemed like someone who might out himself and be an advocate. Looks like he is as corrupt as the rest of them.

        Speaking of real estate, good news!So somebody did a massive short of Israeli bank stocks a few days before October 7th.10/7 was not only allowed to happen, it was steered in the right direction, aided and abetted by the IDF massacring the kibbutzim socialists, Likud’s political opposition.Bibi was threatened with jail, the unions were on national strike, so he got some tips from Larry Silverstein.Now the country is unified behind a war king.The 4Palestine protests, organized internationally by the very same usual suspects who org’d George Floyd?Own both sides.  They are cover and justification for the policy.  “See, those bad people are really crazy!”This is being sold to the conservatives just as the Iraq war was.  We better elect the neocon puppets to save us!The diaspora “opposition” is just negotiating the size of their cut; they too will be paid off in land and power.The good news is, we aren’t going to nuclear war over this.  We’re back in what is becoming familiar territory.

        And who decided that our countryside needed to be littered with windmills, solar panels and 5G towers? They just seem to appear. I don’t recall hearing any cost/benefit or environmental debate. Or who’s getting paid what. Or the implications of re-zoning farmland for industrial / commercial develpment. In the absence of any protection one  can hardly blame those farmers that sell out.

            I know locally there was a pitch by some party to cover local “idle” farmlands with solar panels.  I don’t recall the specifics (it went away for now, thankfully) but there was something in it for all the “rubes” (“you’re providing power to your community”, “you’re part of the green future”, “you’ll be paid for something that you’re not making any money on anyway”, etc.).Or the implications of re-zoning farmland for industrial / commercial develpment.I’m not sure what it’s like in other states but in Ohio there’s a big income tax penalty that has to be paid to do such a change.  I know, it doesn’t seem as effective as it should be, and I’ve seen developers jump over bigger hurdles in other states too.

            Let’s look at this a different way. The “Deciders” own all your Blue Hive cities.  These Blue Hives give them manufactured “democratic” consent to control your state’s politics. The Blue Hives cannot exist without the food and raw material, and now energy generation, of the hinterlands. So the Deciders, resting on the Hive’s politicians, judges, banks, businessmen and easily managed blob of Hive voters… have decided to place the final Hive survival wedge, energy production, into the hinterlands. A very dispersed, fragile, and nearly indefensible energy system… right into the near reach of the hinterland people they seem to fear and despise.I think if I were part of the Decider cabal, I would push for the monopoly of a couple easily defensible nuclear power plants.But then again, I worship the One True God and His Son, and am not crippled by any obeisance to Gaia.Isn’t there a saying about not interfering with your enemy when he is making a mistake?

        If elections and political appointments received an amount of publicity proportional to their impact on your daily life, the zoning commission would be all over the news, and the president and governor not so much. As it is, you scarcely ever hear a peep about the zoning commission, city council, etc. But to be fair, as power has become more centralized, and that centralized power has reached farther into our lives, there is some justification for going on and on about the presidents and the would be presidents. Not enough to justify the wall to wall daily coverage they get, but some. Decisions to put section 8 housing in your neighborhood and to demolish your local coal plant to replace it with windmills are indeed being made by ostensibly democratically elected leaders, and/or their apparatchiks, in DC. Thing is, they weren’t elected by you and the people where you live, but by some shitlib baizuos in California and Vermont who very much approve of these things being done to you (if not in their own backyards). Without getting into ballot harvesting and whatnot.

        Capitalism = economic oligarchy. Socialism = bureaucratic tyrannyThe English writer G. K. Chesterton used to refer to these groups (capitalists and socialists) as Hudge &amp; Gudge and the average gut they wanted to push around as Jones. Neither group cared a whit about Jones except as someone to be exploited.The modern elites have figured out that these supposedly incompatible systems are actually quite compatible and, in fact, reinforcing. The bureaucrats serve the interests of the oligarchs and the oligarchs make sure the bureaucrats are greased. You can dress up the system as democratic but it is just a sham – both of our major parties serve the system, so there is no authentic choice. Furthermore, the system itself runs on money, which is heavily skewed towards the wealthy and getting more skewed all the time. Some on the left complain that this system is fascism but they are mistaken. The old Mussolini-style fascists believed strongly in state-controlled business, not our current business-controlled state. They were also ethnocentric and nationalist. Our current pseudo-fascists hate the nation and its people.

                (Japan, you say?  But they invaded China.The Flying Tigers had been firebombing Japanese cities before war was declared.  They were terrorists telling Japan to stop trying to grab the opium shipments of the Chinese National Air Company, which was in cahoots with FDR.China was becoming a narcostate next door, with the mob bosses organizing a Communist revolution amongst the warlords.  The Emperor had been deposed.Japan proffered a traditional Asian imperial tyranny as an alternative for the entire region, which had been under assault by the HSBC druglords since the 1840s.And yes, with all the traditional Asian cruelty, too.

                    Expect the ZAE’s usual white supremacists to become frantic to flood Nippon with immigrants during the next ten years. Putin has announced that Russia is engaged in a struggle to liberate the world from the Empire of Lies. Given the proximity of Nippon to Russia and China, driving a wedge between the USA and Nippon must become a strategic priority. (Breaking the ZAE’s grip on Hawaii will be another.) I would expect this to involve a combination of fomenting national pride in Japan and a new spirit of cooperation between China and Japan. However, a Japan with ghettos of humanzees and Islamists could complicate this strategy enourmously, esp..if the ZAE instigates raysisses start attacking the ZAE’s colonists.A few influential Rusians may be thinking also about the peculiar history of Mao’s China.RED CHINA IS JEW CHINA: THE DISTURBING ORIGINS OF CHINESE COMMUNISM AND THE DEEPENING CHINESE-‘ISRAELI’ TIES OF TODAYhttps://mouqawamahmusic.net/red-china-is-jew-china-the-disturbing-origins-of-chinese-communism-and-the-deepening-chinese-israeli-ties-of-today/

        Democracy sounds suspiciously like a bureaucratic agency or a corporation.
It’s not the signature, memo, or order of some schlubb in the organization.We don’t know the originating piece of paper or who signed off on this or that form.
It’s “the policy”.  The “policy” is the schlubb defending him or herself, and the other schlubbs tribing up in agreement.
Institutions exist to defend their right to exist, but they are a legal fiction.
It’s really some schlubb defending his personal advancement.

        This is one of the issues where libertarianism really falls on its face.   “It’s my land, if I want to make it a nuclear repository that’s my business.”  Many of their Koch front groups actually advocate for the obliteration of zoning laws altogether.  If you buy a house with a lot behind it, which becomes a McDonalds, and you sit buy the pool in your back yard listening to people order and their cars idling, smelling the exhaust from the fryers, well, that’s not your property.

                There’s a commonality with today’s service industry and the proliferation of begging bowls (tipping) for the help.  It sounds so libertarian on its face – let the customer pay what he feels is appropriate – but in practice it becomes an oppressive form of shame-based extraction.

                        Get used to it Lads.Even ten years ago it was an extremely rare annoying occurrence to recieve your fast food order incorrectly. These days it’s about a 50/50 chance. If they remember you exist while you wait.At macro, unfixed potholes, shoddy USPS delivery, belated police response that has a fair chance of being “unable to do anything” or even finding the complainant to “be the problem”. Increasingly inefficient bureaucracies that rate-hike you with no recourse for their ever diminishing “services”.Yup. Get used to tipping to get things done somewhat sufficiently.As far as dealing with the enforcement arm of government you have a few options. The first is to handle things yourself.  The second is to avoid their “assistance” whenever possible and have all your ducks in a row if you have to call them. The third is to establish a repor with your community where the police feel it necessary to get your neighborhood’s permission to safely conduct official business.Not sure if we are possibly destined for the Brazil or South African paradigm… but in the near future this is what you should come to expect and prepare for.

            The upside of living in the country is being able to largely do what you want. Pissing off the front porch for instance. The downside is so can your neighbors. Having a buffer between your neighbors is a good thing.

        I would go one level deeper. Democracy doesn’t work in large part because the electorate is deficient in many respects. A majority now consist of people who are low IQ, have no skin in the game, easily bribed by unscrupulous politicians, tribal in their voting habits, or prefer big government paternalism to an actual husband. As such, most of the time, we elect the worst hucksters who never held a real job but are good fakers. Add in institutionalized vote fraud and 97+% incumbency, and we are guaranteed to be ruled by unrestrained corruption and incompetence.A human body cannot long survive if it invites in pathogens and gives them permanent residence. Nature intends that such illnesses trigger fever followed by release of antibodies. The sooner this occurs, the faster will be the recovery. The collapse can’t happen soon enough.

            “Democracy doesn’t work in large part because the electorate is deficient in many respects.”
In the old days in the USA and Britain — and in ancient Athens as well — voting was restricted to propertied males. People with skin in the game, and by virtue of their station usually not intellectually deficient.

                Exactly.  There must be a middle ground between rule of an entrenched elite (aristocracy) and rule of the mob (democracy).  We want to prevent an entrenched aristocracy, but not do so with an ignorant mob—who we’ve seen are easily controlled by that entrenched elite.

I will never vote again — after 2020 it finally dawned on me that I simply no longer care. Whatever comes of it is very unlikely to affect me significantly anyway.

                    Lineman:  May I suggest it’s also important to also note who owns nearby property and who is a county official.  Just returned from a weekend in the city and the office Christmas party, where I had very interesting chats with the owner and #2 guy at the company that employs my husband.Both have bought large tracts of rural land in the past few years (so has the #3 guy but I don’t know him personally).  Also important to note that, until we bought our own property, we had no clue any of these gentlemen had bought land and/or made future provisions in the case of economic/societal unrest.  These are wealthy, urban gentlemen who fly around the world and live very comfortable lives.  Yet we were discussing the cost and depth of wells, and putting in culverts in lieu of an old bridge in a county where a neighbor is a county judge.While I wouldn’t necessarily consider them ‘my tribe,’ I would want to be on good terms with them considering their wealth, provisions, influence, and local connections they are forging.It’s not just the hedge fund managers who are preparing ‘bugout’ plans.  These guys aren’t planning on homes in New Zealand, but Texas and Oklahoma and Missouri.

                It’s all well and good to live on your mountaintop–and I don’t mean that ironically–but when you inevitably descend from your mountain to run one errand or another, you’re right back in the middle of the horror show. In other words, as long as you’re living in AINO your sanctuary is very provisional.

        In a democracy, there is only one solution to this problem. Z has spoken of how, one afternoon and in in response to the will of the people, the rulers decided to completely stop immigration. As a complete coincidence, it was immediately after a big bomb went off in from the the JP Morgan offices on Wall Street.Same with the occasional victories against things like the 15 minute cities and the associated surveillance state. Voting worked fantastically and just like it’s supposed to work! Along with a coincidental and amazing level of destruction of those surveillance cameras.If you don’t like Blue state people moving to your neighborhood, you should petition your local representatives to make the appropriate changes. And you should burn their houses down.

        Who decides indeed.  There was an election in a small Michigan town this November where the entire government was replaced.  The previous government thought it was a good idea to build a factory in their area and staff it with Chinese people. The new government vows to reverse this decision and prevent the invasion and destruction of their little world.  Since the new government is made up of people from the community, they might not fink on the voters. The courts may overrule them though.But if instead of being able to vote the bums out (which may or may not work), what if it were a right wing government made up of local elites not subject to voting?  Local elites do not always have the same interests as the ordinary people.  The local elites don’t care if they put up a strip club in the poor part of town if they benefit from it. It won’t be their daughters taking off their clothes and gyrating in front of strange men for dollar bills.The only option the masses would have if the local elites cannot be convinced this is not in their interests is violence.  One can hope for better elites, but hope is not a plan.  Unfortunately, this is the lure of democracy. Democracy may not be a solution, but the problem is real.

        It is clear to anyone who wants to see it (most don’t) that democracy is the process where we are allowed to choose a candidate vetted by the ruling class. Voters are even allowed to vote directly on laws as long as the propositions are approved by the ruling class. If they aren’t, then they are subverted because the ruling class knows best.
For the most part, the people who yammer on about our democracy are the same ones who tout The Science! Only non believers (heretics) disagree and they are evil

        Given your mention of casinos, I hope you’ll allow me a rant.  There are very few things I’ve grown to loathe more than state-sponsored gambling.  It seems to take advantage of the most stupid of human instincts in the most devious manner possible.  When I lived in St. Louis, all the convenience stores/gas stations sold lottery tickets.  I still remember the time I walked into the neighborhood store (probably to buy some booze) and there was a lady in line ahead of me with a stack of lottery tickets.  She handed them to the clerk and asked him if she won anything!  She must have spent at least $20 buying all those tickets and she had no idea whether or not any of them were winners.  She just had to take the clerk’s word that they were all losers or that she’d won the odd buck or two.And something similar happened to me and my wife.  We were staying in Atlantic City for a couple of nights at the Trump Taj Mahal of all places, and my wife wanted to blow some money on the slots.  “Slot machines” however are apparently now computer screens with an 8 by 8 grid of pictures.  If two pictures of a certain type show up on the diagonals and another type of picture is in the upper right corner and no pictures of apples appear in the bottom row, then maybe you win something if no dog pictures are in row 4.  It would literally take hours and hours of study to figure out exactly which of the 10^64 possible combinations of pictures is actually associated with winning.  My wife – God bless her – almost immediately said “F**k this” and we just left the casino to do something else.But that’s state-sponsored gambling.  It elicits what must be some of the stupidest behavior possible.  “Here’s a dollar!  Did I win?”  “No”  Here’s another dollar!  Did I win?”  “No”  Here’s another dollar!  Did I win?”, etc. ad infinitum.

                My experience is somewhat limited to the Trump Taj Mahal, but interestingly enough there were some old school slots there with three cherries in a row.  They were all big money slots though.  You had to bet $20 or more to play them once.  If you want to play a simple game with understandable rules, you have to pony up a lot of money.

                “I figure it’s the red man getting his revenge on the White eyes.”
My history is a bit sketchy and someone may correct me but my understanding is that the Feds curtailed funding the reservations in the ’70s but in return allowed the Injuns to set up casinos (the Feds allowed the states to sanction these casinos). I’m not sure the Injuns actually run them — I’ve heard that it’s often the Italian mafia that does so.

                    I can’t tell you who really runs big casino corporations such as Caesar’s Entertainment or Penn National (just to name two), but typically the way it works is the big casino corporation runs the casino, and the Indians get half, or some percentage, of the profits. Without that corporate profit angle, it’s hard to picture there having been so much impetus for the second coming of the buffalo.

            Cities and states fought “illegal” lotteries for decades saying how immoral they were and that the take was high and how they exploit poor people.  Then they figured out they could offer even worse odds/win ratio and rake in the money.  The pick 3 and pick 4 have 50% takes. The scratch off is probably worse. This is way worse than any casino slot machines and probably worse than the old numbers racket.  Worse, it is presented to the public as a charity scheme to help seniors.They’ve even turned driver’s licenses into grift.  The DMV now sells your license information to marketers.  They require you by law to get the damned license and then they use the information you are compelled by law to give them to make money.  This would completely unacceptable in any normal society.  So would ticket cameras.I’ve always seen casinos as just one big scam.  If you win, they have a right to ban you to keep you from continuing to win.  I’ve always found slot machines boring.

            I can understand sports betting. Or poker, or blackjack. Whether or not you can actually get the odds in your favor, there is still at least some semblance, even if it’s only an illusion, of control on your part. You make the choice. Otherwise, it’s baffling to me how people throw money at casino games that are clearly and openly rigged against them.

                    Was involved in gambling adjacent industries for part of my career.If you find yourself in a room full of operating slot machines, have a listen to the beeps and music. The trick is that taken in the mass, the cacophony of all these machines combined is hypnotic and has ‘beats’ (as in additive sound waves not as in ogg hit rock with stick) components which hover around the alpha wave frequencies. Something similar with the lights. Wouldn’t put it past them to pull similar hypnotic stunts with screen refresh rates and also way the different spinning slot machine columns decelerate wrt each other. You can be sure that in the old-style machines which dropped quarters into a pan when you won, the pan was tuned to make just the right sound and so was the speed at which the quarters were dropped into the pan.There are books written on design of casinos. Light, sound, people movement/flow, traps to catch people with half an intent to leave, etc… And smell is a huge subliminal thing. These days fragrance machines are big.We’re pretty suggestible meat sacks long before even get to question of IQ and us not being evolved to be much good at anything more than the most trivial expected value estimations because had no need for these hunting hairy mammoths and dodging sabre-toot tigers.There does seem to be some kind of East Asian ‘gambling gene’ too.Given human nature, is pointless to kvetch about gambling. Needs to be well-regulated and as always Who? Whom? applies. Needs to be run by our guys and not Sheldon Adelson types.

                Even in sports bettering, the odds favor the house.  This is more or less true of all professional betting.
The only time betting makes any sense is between people known to each other and where both sides have equal say for the terms of the bet.
Just about all other forms of betting come in the shape of a product, a product whose definition is profit for the seller.

                    There’s a great book called The Poker Face of Wall Street by hedge fund guru Aaron Brown. (((Yes… I know))). It’s the gambling / market playing equivalent of Izaak Walton’s Compleat Angler. Or Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. As in there’s more to gambling than just gambling if you’re a genius level player. Much to learn about yourself and the character of those you deal with. He’s less full of himself than Nassim Taleb who has written on similar themes.You don’t have to like these people or their world, but it’s a way to see inside the minds of these outlier types… and like it or not they have immense influence over what happens to us all for now.

            A math professor of mine once said, “Lotteries are a tax on people who don’t understand probability.”Still, SOMEONE has to win!  If you believe that the universe or God cares about you, then maybe that love for you will finally manifest with another lottery ticket.Elliot R, the hapa incel who shot a bunch of people in SoCal made a sustained effort at praying to win various lotteries before he failed repeatedly and then went on his k1lling spree.  He reasoned that the only way that he could attract a thin, pretty, blonde, white woman was to be rich and he couldn’t think of any other way to get rich quickly.  When that failed, well…

            I’ve always had 2 thoughts about state lotteries/scratch-offs.1. They’re a tax on stupidity and they tend to be progressive.2. They are de-moralizing in the sense that I work all my life to keep myself in some level of comfort and to possibly retire in modest circumstances someday. Some schlub blows all his, his wife’s, and his kids’ money on this sh+t and he becomes an instant multi-millionaire.

                Just to be contrarian, there’s the economic value of entertainment.  For instance I once went to a local casino with a buddy with the thought that I would blow $20 there (plus a drink or two, natch), just because they wanted to go.  Well on those funky slot machines it’s possible to idle away huge blocks of time (or at least ‘was’) as I’d lose, win, lose, etc.  They really fuzz up the line between video games and gambling games, especially today.Anyway, sans drinks I think I ended up only blowing $18 over the course of two hours.  There are worse and more expensive ways to amuse oneself for that long.

                    This is true. I’ve learned to have enough compassion to not launch into the “Lotteries are a tax on fools” lecture every time I encounter such people who must needs clutch at straws of hope.

        Couple of years ago (not even) I was talking with a local Black Rep. candidate on the doorstep (he didn’t win the primary FWIW) and he was telling me developers of places like strip joints, casinos etc. in my city basically circumvent opposition from residents by bribing the commissioners who decide. So maybe 100% of a neighborhood don’t want that new degeneracy joint on the corner, but despite all their campaigning they simply forgot to pay off the right people.Heard another story last week about higher up the food chain in this state someone (naming no names, but you’ll all be familiar with him) can make a phone call and the favored developer gets around onerous, expensive OSHA regulations.

Sometimes it’s not even that egregious, unfortunately.  Where I used to live a developer just had to make vague references to higher tax revenue and the rubber stamp approving their project couldn’t come out fast enough.

                Place I grew up in Australia, eventually the biggest local developer got tired of the charade of having to herd his bought councillors at arms length and simply got himself elected mayor. Used to ceremonially recuse himself every time there was a vote on something involving his projects. And the band played on.

            A few years after I moved to my red state redoubt, the Californians started fleeing their state and relocating here.Since we are not allowed to reject them (which is my preferred solution!) “growth” because the big topic in the next local elections.  Candidates had slogans like “Smart growth” and “Planned growth.”I was still on NextDoor social media then.  I simply asked, “Who is the NO GROWTH candidate?  Not smart growth.  Not planned growth.  No growth.”My state is full of salt of the earth Reagan republicans who are good people whom I am glad to have as neighbors.  But my question triggered their libertarianism pretty bad.  “No one’s going to tell me what I can’t do with my property!” they shouted.I’ve seen lived through this 3 times already.  Small-mid towns suddenly lose their quality of life when the price is right for those who own large properties to sell to developers.  And as Z Man noted, those sellers don’t stay around to enjoy the traffic jams, they move to Florida.

                If they moved to Florida, it wasn’t to avoid traffic jams. They were jumping out of the frying pan, into the fire.Florida is “the template,” for this kind of development. I live in a small beach town between FT Lauderdale  and Miami. It is nothing but strip malls, strip malls, more strip malls, high rise apartments, town house gated communities, and strip malls. It is absolutely the most absurd thing I’ve ever seen. Moved here for a very good job and to escape NY state politics. From western N.Y. Not NYC.Out of the frying pan, sizzling on the fire!

            A neighboring township (one of the largest in the state no less) has zero zoning, zippo.  I was visiting a resident and inquired about the non-stop motorcycle noise and they noted that what used to be a golf course was now a motocross strip.  They then took light offense when I suggested that maybe some zoning would be in order, since non-stop motorcycle noises I guess were worth the price of them being able to stand whatever building they wanted to up on their property however and whenever they wanted.

        I have a bit of real world experience with this. About ten years ago, a developer wanted to buy a chunk of land just down the street from the high school and turn it into a subsidized housing complex.Now, you can’t get a more obviously horrible plan for an area than bringing in dysfunctional poor people and, as a bonus, putting them across the street from high school kids.Naturally, the developer was from NJ, so he couldn’t care less about our little area.Stunningly, the town council was all for the project, despite the overwhelming majority of the area hating the idea. Why?Well, the town council was made up people who either owned local businesses, were related to people who owned local businesses or were old friends with those people. The developer had made sure to let the local construction, lumber, landscaping, contractors, etc., that he’d use them to build the project. Sure, the town would be a little worse off, but you’d be dramatically better off.Luckily, my area is in the DC area so there’s a fair amount of people with political, legal and organization skills. The locals created an opposition group, filed some legal stuff to stop the project until more discovery could be done, somehow stopped a vote by the town council, etc.But my area is unusual. In 99% of towns/suburbs, the developer would have succeeded.

            A small town where I have a house suddenly found out that the city council had decided to increase the city limits by 50% and build housing on all of the new land.  I had been thinking of making that home my residence because of its small town charm.This was universally opposed by the people.  At the town meetings, ever person who spoke out to the council opposed the plan except for the people who were paid to promote it.The city council said that they were going to defer making a decision for six months, which made me angry in itself, because the people had clearly spoken.  So everyone went home and got on with their lives.Three week later, at a meeting on a Wednesday afternoon, the city council decided to accept the plan.Today, the main road through that formerly small town has some of the worst traffic congestion in the state.  The small town feel has been irretrievably lost.I speculate that the developers simply make big contributions to all the politicians and viable candidates to ensure that they get their way, although I’ve never actually tried to verify my guess.

        I live in a rural area that gets less rural by the year.  It used to be a very tight-knit community with only mom and pop shops.  As a kid, I enjoyed going with my grandma to the local grocery store.  These stores disappeared as the owners died, and their kids moved on to other things.  The local gas station owner sold his business to Indians, the dot kind.  More and more of the woods and countryside gets torn down, and houses are built for shitlibs who proudly display their rainbow flags and Joe Biden 2024 signs. It is a shame.

        I heard the Amish kept their community as farmland and out of the hands of developers whenever a property came up for auction, they’d show up and collectively outbid any price an outsider would offer. Not sure if that’s still their practice though.

            They’re actually expanding around me. They never sell to outsiders and since a lot of the farmers are aging out and lots don’t have kids that want to keep farming, the Amish will come in and buy large tracts of farmland that are coming up for sale.
Fine with me — I’d rather see the land kept agricultural.
The future belongs to those who show up.

                They readily sell out to the English by me (full disclosure: they even sold out to me) but my impression has been that the Amish by me are mostly craftsman when where I used to live they had more of a reputation as farmers.  The locals still farm but usually it’s just for hay for their own horses and a small plot for canning stuff for the winter.That brings up an interesting zoning issue as a house with no water(well) or electricity is more of a liability for the community than an asset.  I won’t expound upon it now but will only note that the big money men aren’t the only ones who do their best to “color outside the lines” when it comes to development.

                    I was just flat out wrong on them never selling to outsiders, as I would have recalled if I looked back on my very own experience — when I was looking to buy my farm one of the places I checked out was Amish owned. They said they were Old Order Amish, but the house was really nice, with electricity and plumbing, and a wood furnace. It seemed like they’d done every legalistic dodge they could to stay within the letter of their religious law, if not quite the spirit.But, that was about 30 years ago, and since they are one of the few White demographics that’s actually above replacement rate, I encounter them more often when they’re buying these days.Back then, you could still find even non-Amish homes in Southeast Ohio with functioning outhouses and limited indoor plumbing. A little 40-acre place I looked at was like that. 19th century home with no indoor toilet, outhouse out back, house heated with free gas from an oil well on the property, using simple radiant heaters installed in all the old fireplaces — the gas had totally destroyed the chimney mortar.I used to be able to count at least a half dozen outhouses on the drive up the state route to the nearest city. Most of them weren’t in use anymore, but they were still there, until they cracked down on them about 15(?) years ago or so.

            “Not sure if that’s still their practice though.”
If they can afford it they do. And there’s the rub: affordability. Land in Ohio and Pennsylvania has become too expensive for the Amish and so some years back they started buying land in Southeast Minnesota, where they now have a settlement.

            Vizzini:  We heard there was lots of controversy when the local Walmarts were built in the area we moved to – cannot locate exact year, but I know it was within the last 6-8.  Closest to us is in a neighboring small town, 15 miles/28 minutes away, and while it is convenient, that is too close in all honesty.

                Google Maps tell me mine’s 20 miles and 27 minutes away (the state routes between here and there are really good, a series of broad creek valleys that happen to run in the right direction, so not much winding. You don’t get the same thing if you head south).
I sure wouldn’t want it any closer.

                    Vizzini:  Part of the time/distance going anywhere from our home includes the three miles of dirt road (well maintained, but dirt/gravel nonetheless) before we hit pavement.  And both dirt and pavement are winding and hilly.

        The images of who is coming over the border and how are absolutely breath taking. It is a strange ghoulash where at the top Mayorkas and his buddies have decided that there is no border, and at the border where guards pretend to still guard it, nobody decides who comes and goes.Things are so hazy that those who know what is going on can’t name things aptly. Is it a failed state? Well, if the project is to destroy the state it is succeeding and there is no state. It is like that. In the end, we can easily trace and track the names and financiers of this demolition.

            My solution would be to treat them as vacationers. If they want to step over the border, fine, but they have to pay to stay in motels, pay for their meals at restaurants, find affordable/available housing. They get no rights. No voting, no turning themselves in to any agency, no work papers, no schooling, nothing. Leave them alone, and they’ll go home, dragging their tails behind them.

            I still haven’t been able to get over how, when the people at the top told the Border Patrol that not only are we not going to enforce immigration law anymore, we are actually going to act in concert to directly subvert and defy it, and moreover we are going to actively promote and facilitate illegal immigration, and all the Border Patrol did was say, “Yes sir, right away sir.”

        “Democracy and socialism put the people’s stamp of approval on the economic relations. … The greatest trick the ruling class ever pulled is in convincing the people they do not exist.”Mike of TRS speculated that the Soviet Union versus the USA was an A-B test run by the group that actually won WW2.  One of the main reasons that they gave up on the communism of the Soviet Union was that it was too easy to identify those to blame.This obscuring of responsibility, which is a result of representative government in a large country, was a criticism made by a failed painter.

        In other degeneracy news today, Norman Lear has finally gone to hell at the age of 101.  I assumed he died years ago as he hadn’t made much news recently.  No one better represented the hatred Hollywood has for the historic American people than Lear.  Unlike many of them, he was upfront and open about it.  I did not know until reading this obit on him that his father was imprisoned for selling fake bonds.  How did we survive before these people came to our country?

                    In sixth grade, public school, I was trusted to deliver the lead character’s lines in It Happens Every Christmas. I played Father Crawford, my wife was really Betty G., and we had a gaggle of storybook children, each of us pontificating the true meaning of Christmas. The jewish complainers were allowed to take the day off. After the hour-long play, we had a town Christmas Fest with cake walks, seasonal goodies, and egg nog, some it plus holiday punch spiked by the staff.West Michigan, tail end of the 1970’s. Christian play. Heavy community involvement. Public school. Jews, who were vastly outnumbered by Dutch Reformed (49%) and Germans (45%), both demos fairly fresh off the WWII noats.No Fiddling on the Kike Roof then. As it will be.

        I’ve lost faith in “democracy” in stages over time, but it’s become patently obvious in recent years that it’s nothing but a sham/scam.  The thing that initiated that discovery was usually the ballot referendums, either in my city or state.  They were often something popular with the people, but not necessarily with those in government.  So, when they got voter approval, as sure as s***, they would start working to subvert that will, typically getting some worthless magistrate to overturn the will on some nebulous technicality, or maybe it was supposedly unfair to some slice of the demographic.  It become clear that voting the “wrong way” ultimately wasn’t going to count in the long run.As for farms etc., turning into housing developments or apartment  complexes, there is just way too much damn money floating around in the system.  Anyone, it seems, can be bought off, always chasing the almighty dollar.  I guess it’s hard to blame someone when a ridiculous amount of lucre is being waived in your face.  The whole system in this former country is corrupt and beyond any kind of repair.  It’s going to have to be rebuilt from scratch, unfortunately – not a happy prospect, but a necessary one.

            A perfect example of this practice is the whole gay marriage scam. In every state that there was a public initiative/referendum to legalize gay marriage, they were overwhelmingly voted down, even in very liberal states. Yet, the gay lobby kept pushing them, hoping that eventually they people would vote correctly. When that never happened, they used the courts. We all know how that turned out.

        “If the decision is being made by the nebulous concept of democracy, where voting never seems to make a difference, then that man telling his kids that the apartment complex where the cops are always at used to be a farm, owned by a family that first came to the state at the founding, has every right to wonder if the real cause of the problem is that nebulous thing called democracy. Maybe he would be better served by someone, anyone, who takes responsibility for these decisions.”“Democracy” provides camouflage for the oligarchs who own and run the country. It does seem that a hefty chunk of the population has gone though such intense Pavlov conditioning  that support for the empty ritual of voting has become a knee-jerk response.As I see it, the problem is not only who decides, but on what basis. An open admission that “democracy” is a charade, a farce, a set of empty rituals and that oligarchy is the name of the game would possibly create new problems in its wake. On what grounds would oligarchs govern in an openly admitted oligarchy? As i understand it, it was this very problem that led to the creation of the office of emperor in Rome: he was the final authority. he was the only one who could reconcile the demands of the plebs with the reality of oligarchic landowners.

            This constant carping about “democracy” is an intentional head fake; The Founders hated the idea of democracy because it always winds up in dictatorship. This nation was founded as a representational, constitutional republic. The Electoral College is the bulwark which protects us from being governed by Los Angeles, Chicago, &amp; NYC.
On another note my late father always pointed to zoning laws as being responsible for the fat problem in this country; when you forcibly – &amp; artificially – incorporate areas for businesses too far to walk to this is what you get.

            Neither have I and I’ve been voting since I was 18 years old which would have made it 1968. And realistically all I ever really wanted was to be left alone. I don’t mind paying my taxes I do mind being screwed. I don’t mind preferring my civil duties. I do mind when they have rigged elections. And don’t tell me elections aren’t rigged cause I’m from Philadelphia and my father was a Democrat ward leader and in 1952 I watched them rigged the election to turn Philadelphia Democrat for the first time in history but it never went back.But honestly neither party has ever delivered anything that I wanted. Not one damn thing period

        The act of voting doesn’t improve anything but implicitly makes me culpable to the desolation brought on my community and country.
By the way, a handful of city council people and ordinance committees seem hell bent on slowly allowing the moral destruction of small cities in my area. Pot houses and tattoo parlors everywhere now. Some only hundreds of feet from each other. Ain’t that just lovely?

            Ugh. The “urban” neighborhoods in Ohio already smell like weed all the time. Now that it’s completely legalized it’s going to get really bad. There will be those pot houses even out in my rural area and if you complain, you’ll be the bad guy. “It brings economic opportunity!”
Yeah, and scores of stoners wasting their lives. As if the meth, oxy and fentanyl weren’t enough. We’ll have just as much of those, but nestled in a nice, pacifying haze of legal weed.

                Somewhere, there’s that fine line between criminalizing every pothead, which is a waste of everybody’s time and resources, and promoting marijuana use, which is probably worse. We seem to be on the promotion side of it now. If there was some way to decriminalize it without promoting it that would be ideal, but I don’t know if it’s possible.

                    Blowing herbs is degenerate behavior popularized by the counterculture in the 60s and 70s. The degenerates are now the Power Structure. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Power Structure smiles upon smoking weed.

            When I cross from Indiana into Michigan, I am now greeted by a sea of billboards advertising the pot shops in Michigan. A state that has boundless natural beauty if you stay away from the Detroit-Flint-Saginaw corridor is basically a giant pot shop with some lakes and forests.
