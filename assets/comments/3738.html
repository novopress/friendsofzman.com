        The article was a treasure trove of jargon and new speak.  I actually love the linguistic gymnastics the cults engage in.  I love micro aggressions, cis – whatever, intersection, structures, normative, etc.  Your observation that whenever a new buzz word or phrase surfaces it generally signifies some untruth or idiocy is spot on.

        Z, don’t know if you read The Other McCain (http://theothermccain.com/), but he must have his unofficial Doctorate by now thru his reporting on queer/feminist culture. One could spend days reading about the bizarre stuff he’s uncovered.Most of these strange theories come from the liberal arts areas of universities, and when exposed to mainstream culture, ie., normal folks, is mostly seen as the insanity it really is. Example; if it weren’t for high priests in black robes (judiciary), gay marriage still wouldn’t exist as it’s been voted down almost everywhere it’s been on a ballot.

        Z, do you know about Yuri Bezmenov, the former KGB agent and defector?His 1983 lecture on political subversion is especially interesting:“The main emphasis of the KGB is NOT in the area of intelligence at all, only about 15% of time, money, and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other 85% is a slow process we call either ideological subversion or active measures.To change the perception of reality of every American that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions. That process is legitimate and open, you can see it with your own eyes.”Well worth the time:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fQoGMtE0EY
