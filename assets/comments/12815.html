        Holy shit, that memo is way worse than anybody realized.  It reads like a Greatest Hits list of all the anti-Trumpers at the FBI.  Sally Yates signed off on the fraudulent FISA warrants.  Comey signed off on THREE of them.  The warrants themselves were submitted to the court without disclosing the source of the dossier, and the FBI “corroborated” the dossier using media reports – media reports that had been planted by Christopher Steele several weeks prior.  Andrew McCabe testified to Congress that the FBI would not have been able to get the warrants without the dossier.Towards the end, the committed updates everybody on Peter Strzok who had opened up a counterintelligence investigation based on that guy Papadapolis.  The Committee’s clear implication is that there was a parallel effort to initiate criminal investigations against Trump based on hearsay, and that this parallel effort was led by ferocious antiTrump FBI agents.The other, parallel, effort of course being the dossier, as well as ONGOING efforts by Bruce Ohr (whose wife was doing antiTrump oppo-research at FusionGPS) to funnel information from Steele to the FBI even after the FBI cut ties with Steele.Not to be missed in all of this: that Steele a an ex British spy, and his main sourcing for the dossier was…wait for it!…the Russian FSB (formerly the KGB)…and it was all paid for by the Clinton Campaign and the DNC.

            One gets the feeling that they couldn’t get anything on Trump, so they made up some stuff to get the FISA warrant, figuring that with the warrant, they would find something that was real, and then work backwards to cover their tracks.  Except that even with the FISA warrant, they found nothing.  Then Trump wins.  As Hillary is said to have exclaimed after The Donald took the Prize (I have no idea what is real any more with what these people might have said), “We are all going to hang from nooses”.  Guess she knew how it all went down.Now the panic begins.  This stuff is likely the tip of the iceberg.  I have always thought of Donald Trump as a sort of disinfectant, that kills all the germs and viruses, generally by providing sunlight.  Hope the treatment doesn’t kill the patient.

                What they needed, and Steele confirmed, was “an investigation”.  Steele was angry that only Hillary was being investigated.  Apparently, Strzok had the same idea.

        Decent podcast.   Sounded very close to your usual quality, for such little post-recording attention.
You know, a lot of people in the dem party (i.e. elected officials) are really stupid, as per the Kennedys.    And that isn’t even counting the amazingly grotesque members of the black caucus.

        I’m glad I’m not the only one who despises all the hype around the Superbowl.  I’m a Patriots fan and I find the games almost impossible to watch.  I won’t intentionally watch a moment of any pre-game show with ex-jocks and bimbos making predictions.  I know I’ll leave the room and do other things during the halftime show (the only part my wife watches) and come back at some point in the 3rd quarter when I remember the game is still on.  Even during commercial breaks, I’ll probably doing other stuff.If the Pats weren’t in it, I would lose interest by the end of the first quarter or when I fill up on snacks, whichever came first.

            I hate to say it but without Africans the NBA would suffer. ”Fundamental Basketball” is what the WNBA plays – and it’s boring. That was proven way back in the 70’s with the ABA vs. NBA rivalry:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcaQHlzjDAA

        The opening bars of “The Ride of the Valkyrie”never fails to remind me of just how irredeemably fucked up a country is when it’s known to the majority of Americans as the“Kill the Wabbit” song.

        Look where the links go on this site:http://www.officialblaxit.org/They’re all to foreign real estate offices. I’m guessing this is actually a real estate scam… sell the properties that are too pricey for locals to those dumb but relatively well-heeled Americans. And since when is Budapest a “black homeland” ??!
Still, more power to ’em — your homeland needs you. Go Blaxit!
