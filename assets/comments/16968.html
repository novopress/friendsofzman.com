        I watched the speeches on Youtube, and I thought the best one was given by that young girl, Jasmina. She spoke in Finnish, though, so it‚Äôs not much use for foreign audience to listen to it, but I can summarize her main points. Basically her message was: Stop whining and look in the mirror. Yes, we are being ruled by treasonous scum, but there are still plenty of things you can do in your own life to protect our people and our culture, so stop making excuses and start acting.First of all, decisions about the future existence of our nation are not made only in the Parliament house, but also in bedrooms. Stop following the main stream culture that says you have to spend ten years studying in a university and travel around the world instead of starting a family early.Second, the decisions you make in your everyday life will have an effect on whether our culture keeps on declining or not. Do you visit restaurants of multinational fast food chains and buy their junk food or not? Do you buy a cheap pizza made by some Arabs who bring their alien religion to our country or not? Do you use the words of your own language or do you use loaned words from English when you speak? And so on.Quite a few people listening to her probably feel a little sting in their hearts and think, damn, I should get my act together. I sure did üôÇ

            The basic (I won‚Äôt say ‚Äúlittle‚Äù because making a family is dead-ass important) things are vastly under rated. Money multipliers may not exist for Keynesian policies, but they work quite well in the real world. When you give money to an enemy it passes through many enemy hands before it ends up back in your camp. You aren‚Äôt simply spending money in an establishment, you are supporting entire families and giving them resources to bring in more of their relatives and petition the government for even more favors.
It‚Äôs not just a sandwich.

        Appreciate the travelogues and this update about ‚Äòthe event‚Äô.  At first I thought all the dead drop, circuitous route spy craft was was tongue in cheek. Then I realized given the current climate our ‚Äòbetters‚Äô perpetuate, it must be quite necessary. Yeesh‚Ä¶ Let me know if I‚Äôm wrong‚Ä¶I think sober minded adults in ‚Äòour thing‚Äô, used to behaving well like rational adults, have yet to accept the reality of the situation you so clearly state. We are under attack because we threaten those in charge. We have to develop that ‚Äòhard edge‚Äô attitude required to be Radical. Willingness to see this as serious business. A wry sense of humor is to be encouraged but ‚Äòwe‚Äô can‚Äôt expect to be treated as rational adults by those who hate us. The nuts and bolts of what that means need to be passed on/passed around. Or at least useful example/sources pointed out? My few kopeks of cogitation comrade. Up the ‚ÄúOur Thing‚Äù  Guys‚Ä¶.

                    Well it does raise the interesting question of whether white prison gangs are aware of the dissident right. Do members of the Aryan Brotherhood have fanboy pictures of John Derbyshire in their cells? Who knows zman might get treated like a king in prison.

        Agree on the two points about positive message and the need to operate as radicals.  But each of us needs to do a self assessment and figure out where you can best contribute.  I‚Äôm deep in enemy territory.  There are more of us here than one might think, but organization and meaningful action is difficult.  But we‚Äôre trying to figure it out.  But there are opportunities close at hand.  My spouse and I reproduced at 2x replacement.  So far we‚Äôre about 3.5 for 4 in inculcating the basic operating principles of whatever you want to call ‚Äúour thing‚Äù.  Not overtly, but taking advantage of opportunities.  For example when one of my daughters took AP US, the atrocious level of teaching gave me an opportunity to spend the year with her basically re-teaching the course.  (It‚Äôs my academic background).  Lot of good. long discussions on history and political thought.  Then out of the blue this weekend she asks me, ‚Äúwho is this Jordan Peterson guy?  I found a a few of his podcasts and he really does a good job of explaining Marxism and Socialism‚Äù.  Turns out she‚Äôs started listening to podcasts while working on AP Art projects and stumbled on the Intellectual Dark Web series.  Now I know there is a lot of hate for Peterson around here‚Äìbut he serves a very useful purpose.  Upshot‚Äìevery good revolutionary is an opportunist.  We need to have a long term goal, but waste no opportunity that presents itself.  Particularly if it is a force multiplier.

            This is something I thought about regarding myself. I‚Äôm feeling pressure to do more, but that means figuring out my own tolerance for pain. It also means a frank assessment of what I can do that is worthwhile.

                    I tend to agree.  Every movement needs its thought leaders.  There is a hierarchy in any movement.  If you were not a ground pounder in the past, forget about becoming one now. Your highest value to the movement may well be doing what you are now doing.

            Counter-signal.
I think our road to power is long and slow, based in decidedly un-radical bourgeois institution building. I think we should study the successes and failures of the Turkish Gulen cult, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the ‚Äô79 revolutionaries of Iran. Electoral politics and street politics could be discounted in favor of a coup d‚Äô√©tat.

                A coup won‚Äôt work in a nation of 400m people with radically divergent cultures.  It would take Old America‚Äôs patriotism to command that kind of obedience.  Agree that street demonstrations will just turn into Charlestown and electoral politics in a two-party system aren‚Äôt promising.Trump‚Äôs betrayals and the continuing shitshow of kabuki Red-Blue politics will red-pill many more Americans by 2021.  Provide them a positive identify, teach them how to protect themselves from SJW attack, let them know they‚Äôre not alone.  Absent Act of God events, this will play out over decades.  Big Other will die when enough worker-bees reject its morality.

        I don‚Äôt think that politics (in any form) is going to right the ship of state and redirect us toward a viable remedy or future improvement. Rather, things will get worse until we hit bottom, and then the real work of rebuilding from the ashes must begin. When the elites have grown sufficiently fearful to justify extreme persecution of the non-conformists, then the response must be effective more so than historical. Such is the new age in which we live. They are very effective means of beating the next variant of tyranny. It‚Äôs just not what you may think it is.

            Politics may not right the Ship of State, but it will influence how the Ship sinks, and will govern the reconstruction.  We build the foundations of the future by political action now.  The Left understands this, and has been acting on it for over a century.  That is why we are in the mess we are in;  the Right has not acted in response, in part because the Right ceded the philosophical battleground to the enemy.
This is, first and foremost, a war of Ideas.

I disagree. If you are dying of Stage 4 cancer, no ideology is going to cure your illness. Our current dysfunction as a society is not a failure of persuasion. It‚Äôs a decline of our essential human spirit, wrought by the corruption (or absence) of fitness selection in our modern culture in which hardship and the gauntlet of existential threat have now become extinct.

Correct. The current culture is selecting for dependence, hive conformity, obesity, lethargy, and overall weakness of mind and body. It leads to an evolutionary dead-end. That is not a path I wish to follow.

                    The real problem is that unlike every other time in the past, this time the invaders have arrived unarmed, with their hands up, accompanied by their women and children, not threatening us but instead whingeing and moaning about how they are ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and ‚Äúof color‚Äù and they ‚Äújust want a better life‚Äù (meaning of course OUR life, OUR land, OUR stuff, OUR women) and nobody has the nerve yet to shoot innocent begging monkeys, or their monkey-children.

Only means the price at the final checkout counter will be FAR higher, though.

            Collett‚Äôs an optimistic dude; it‚Äôs impossible to deny him that. Don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs perpetually ‚Äúon something‚Äù or one of the very few people naturally deposed that way. He got a little shitty with me in the conments for ‚ÄúThis Week on the Alt-Right‚Äù a few times. He‚Äôs a little sensitive to being childless, if I recall. I told him to use that landing strip of a nose to fornicate with a jewess would more likely produce children than telling the alt-right to procreate. His return fire sucked, but it was a bant nonetheless.

        Soviet &amp; Warsaw Pact dissidents lived under worse conditions for decades &amp; lived to see the USSR fall. Current Year‚Äôs Big Other suffers the same fatal flaw between its rhetoric and reality as Leninism.  We can use similar tactics.  25% support is a tipping point for dissident ideas.  Once 1/4 of the population is red-pilled in a democracy, we have the leverage for our agenda.Z‚Äôs correct in emphasizing practical skills.  We lack the practical skills of political dissent and resistance that Europeans still practiced while we enjoyed Morning in America.  Past Euro and Soviet dissidents are getting long in the tooth.  Teaching their knowledge and experience to our nascent dissidents could be of great help.  While these folks are still with us, let our publishers know we need to put their stories on record.  We need them talking about how they fought totalitarian social control.  Let our groups know we‚Äôd like speakers with experience in practical organizing, including ‚Äúcovert‚Äù operation to avoid doxxing, de-platforming etc‚Ä¶  We already know why we‚Äôre fighting.  We need to know how.  Give me a speaker who can give practical advice on how to operate online anonymously, how to do secure communications, financial planning including offshore accounts, Antifa and surveillance state tactics, etc‚Ä¶

            100% this re: Soviet Era and Warsaw Pact dissidents.And I would like to use it to dovetail into something else mentioned above. The ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù of the dissident right, already exists, at least in small form.‚ÄòThe Power of the Powerless‚Äô was the defacto dissident‚Äôs manual during the Soviet occupation era. It was a way to acquire the radical mindset and action without getting pulled up by the Stasi, Politburo, etc. and get on radars.See it is like this‚Ä¶ we feel lost in this maze of dictatorial bureaucracy but there is truly nothing new under the sun. Instead of Red Communism being the State Religion it is now Brown Diversity. It is a radical death cult the same as the Commies of the prior century just wearing a different skinsuit.The useful idiot devotees are the same as their forebearers. Creating the same unsustainable intolerance environment and it will likely end the same way as well. This is because the stupids know nothing of history so they really think they are doing something novel and new. When looked at from the arc of history it is the same tired old shit repackaged for the millennial stupids.If you have never seen or read this text, I ‚Äîhighly‚Äî recommend it as an entry point to the mindset. We are rapidly approaching a totalitarian police state of the sort where the text was birthed from so its words are becoming more and more relevant today.  It isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòCommon Sense‚Äô but it is a damn good starting block. Full text can be found most anywhere online, or here (31 pages you can read it in less than an hour with full comprehension):https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/the-power-of-the-powerless/

        In one of Trump‚Äôs (now many) disgraceful cucks, he had the chance to designate Antifa a terrorist organization early in his presidency. Of course ideological trannies, like National Review, urged him not to, and he didn‚Äôt.
It would have been a big help, both practically and psychologically. Add that to the list of Trump‚Äôs disastrous inactions.

        That means we have to stop trying to play by the rules when organizing and conspiring.Giving yourselves plausible cover would be a start. Form a group where businessmen can discuss the protein content in soya beans and meet under that umbrella. Book venues, etc. under that guise (you could even build a website, print some brochures) and insist to anyone and everyone you‚Äôre going to talk about soya beans. Hell, you could even *have* a talk on soya beans if you really want good cover. But never, ever admit who you really are unless lying will result in criminal prosecution.

        The American Revolution would never have succeeded, had it not been for the existence of a brief, lucid, concise, reasonable, easy-to-read, best-selling pamphlet called ‚ÄúCommon Sense,‚Äù written by a foreign observer named Thomas Paine.The secret ingredient of ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù was that it contained a great deal of common sense.To have any sort of positive further development of the pieces on the board (hint: you chaps don‚Äôt control the center, and you‚Äôre not even pressuring the center, you‚Äôre making moves like P-QR2), one of you boyos is going to have to write ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù.  Or ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin‚Äù at the very least.The Turner Diaries is NOT the document you need.

            Indeed.  ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù was the match that lit the fire, but the kindling was laid decades, even centuries before.  The ideas driving the American Revolution were derived from English Common Law and English History, and matured in a land remote from the power of the Crown.  Estimates are that at least 1 copy of ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù was printed and purchased for every 10 colonists, which means that almost everyone had read it or at least heard of it, but the acceptance of the ideas in ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù were based on the ideas at play at the time.To quote another Founder-  ‚Äú‚ÄúIt does not take a majority to prevail. but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.‚Äù  Sam Adams.  Also- ‚ÄúRemember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy that did not commit suicide.‚Äù  and most presciently-‚Äú‚Ä¶encroachments on the peoples‚Äô liberties are not generally made all at once, but so gradually as hardly to be perceived by the less watchful; and all plaistered over, it may be, with such plausible pretenses, that before they are aware of the snare, they are taken and cannot disentangle themselves.‚ÄùNow that America is ensnared, the path forward has to be rightful action driven by ideas that promote individual liberty.  It will take willpower to empower that ‚Äòtireless minority‚Äô, which comes only from knowing how badly we have betrayed ourselves, which in turn comes only from the ideas of Liberty.  Over 50% of the people in this country are dependent upon government for their sustenance;  apart from any other fact, that will require a powerful countervailing attitude.

You could not be more wrong.  The primacy of ‚Äúindividual liberty‚Äù is one of the main reasons that white people are now helpless before non-white tribalism.  Whites must become tribal themselves to repel the existential threats arrayed against us and such tribalism is not possible when we ‚Äúpromote individual liberty.‚Äù
What I‚Äôve said above does not mean that I don‚Äôt cherish individual liberty.  It just means that I understand that individual liberty is only possible in a white country.

                    In other words, individual liberty may be a worthy goal, but preaching about the virtues of individual liberty is not a means to achieve that goal in our current multicultural society. First we have to achieve freedom as a group, then we can discuss what is the proper relationship between the individual and the collective.

                Organizations like Sons Of Liberty and Masonic lodges were important as well. Alexander Hamilton had a group of young men learning military exercise and practiced performing movements without firearms before any revolution ever happened. I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs going to be a violent confrontation. These guys were organized and had their leadership worked out long before any showdown came to pass.They bypassed convention and used whatever means at hand there was to organize. Even used churches. But I don‚Äôt think the American Revolution is the best model. Our founders had the advantage of independent rule and state governments for a hundred years before our revolution. Sure, the British held what looked like the commanding heights of officialdom, but our system of independent government had been written in stone under their benign neglect.Part of the reason I think the French Revolution is a better model is that we have no foreign power in control in any official capacity (depending on how far Israel keeps increasing influence), and most of the tyranny we have around us is home grown, and is absolutist and centralizing in character, much like that of the government in France. We have recreated the estates as well, our elites stand in for the nobility (second estate), and the university system is our first estate. We don‚Äôt have a king per se, but the Wilsonian version of the executive branch, with administrative law and permanent ministries that pass through multiple presidencies, stands in well for an hereditary monarch, in fact, I would say that this system is even more monarchical than any real king. Look at Trump. He‚Äôs a stand-in. Virtually powerless before the bureaucracy that is the real power.And finally, we are the new Third Estate. We are the people without which the entire thing falls apart, but we have little or no say in how things get run. We want more local autonomy and more of a say in the structure and function of government, but our elites are in league with the central power because it has become their own source of power rather than any local ties they may have once had. They have moved to Versailles.

                    Will keep harping on the need for organization and taking advantage of the skills our side has.  On both direct sides my 5x grandfathers were experienced militia officers in what what then ‚ÄúLast of the Mohicans‚Äù territory.  Both fought extensively in the F&amp;I and various Indian skirmishes during ‚Äô50s and 60s.  The paternal one commanded a company at the age of 57 at Saratoga (you are never too old to contribute)  The maternal narrowly escaped capture at Fort Montgomery.  While they could not stand up to British regular forces unaided, they were able to practice ‚Äúarea denial‚Äù throughout the Hudson valley.  The sons enlisted and served in the NY Line.  But I‚Äôll go back to the ‚Äúarea denial‚Äù concept.  What we have to do is have sufficient organization to at least make life miserable or untenable for leftists‚Äìat the places and times of our choosing.

                Yes, I did say that.  But let me tell you the real secret.   We had a network, in every colony.  All were in communication with each other, so when the time was ripe it was as though an entire movement appeared out of nowhere.  And we accomplished  with nothing but letters, local meetings and horsemen.

        It was a major coup that NR reviewed Kevin Macdonald at all.  They had to step back a little and give some condemnation to pacify their Jewish readers or donors, or wherever the influence actually lays.I just got the latest issue of NR and there are literally three full length articles in praise of Jews or Israel.  I thinks it‚Äôs in response to the illyan Omar thing, but even for the non antisemite the fixation feels‚Äîunseemly.  How would you react to constant articles in praise of Italians, or Irish, or any other particular identity?  It would seem strange at best.  I can‚Äôt understand why others do not react negatively.

                I suspect a big part of the game for outlets like NR is to stay on the magazine racks.  An executive decision not to carry from Barnes and noble(I‚Äôve heard it was Jewish owned) or books a million would devastate them.  Already some places, such as the Barnes and noble in Shreveport, don‚Äôt get NR.

        Maybe it‚Äôs a good time to go through Whittaker Chambers  Witness and take notes about how they communicated clandestinely. It‚Äôs possible even without the internet and we know that because it‚Äôs been done through millennia,  the Communists were just particularly good at it. It‚Äôs always scary to follow the Communists into anything because of the myriad of crimes both large and small they committed for decades but remember they believed in the perfectibility of human nature.

        ‚ÄúWe are the new Jacobins‚Äù ‚Äìamazing. This is a phrase I have been using for about four years in conversation. Also one of the reasons I have been reading about the French Revolution. I don‚Äôt know why right wingers don‚Äôt just join and take over the dying Masons organization. Many Jacobin clubs were formed out of Masonic lodges, and many if not most of the revolutionaires were masons before they were anything else. In fact, I think that using a model like that and sticking to it a bit more strongly would be a good idea. I don‚Äôt see where the worst of the guys running the Terror, Robespierre and St. Just, were masons. They were loners with great skill at finding points of dissension between others and exploiting them in ways that allowed them to acquire leadership positions. Ruthless people tend to seek power, and a trick of having a successful organization is getting leadership that can be ruthless when need be, but isn‚Äôt as a rule.And a further caution would be that an understanding of how things should be run needs to be worked out ahead of time, in order to avoid the dissensions and purges that happen when people come into power. Simply having some utopian vision without a workable structure is a basis for disaster. House on rock vs sand, IOW.One bit of wisdom I came across yesterday from Madame de Stael was in her discussion of how the terrorists came into power because of the lack of ability of the others to compromise with each other. In turn the royalists, Feuillants, constitutional monarchists, Girondins, and moderate republicans refused to work with each other, or maintained suspicions past the point where their cooperation would have made a difference. The key is being able to assess the political battlefield, determine where the party lines actually are, and support whatever party has a chance of success whose platform is most like yours *even if their program differs greatly from your own*. If the experience of the French Revolution teaches anything, it is that accelerationism leads to stuff like the Terror, not whatever utopia the accelerationist has in mind. If you like watching your kids heads get lopped off before you get your own shaved down, it‚Äôs great, though.In other words, accelerationism is nihilism.

            One thing I should make clear: the Jacobin Club at the time of the terror, the one that had to be shut down by the Thermidorians, was not the same club begun in the early stages of the Revolution. It began as something one would think of as being somewhat like the Tea Party movement, an organization called The Society of the Friends of the Constitution. It took its name Jacobin from the monastery where it met. Everyone who was not an absolute monarchist who played a role in the Revolution started out in the Jacobin Club and even up to the time the terror began even Robespierre did not have absolute control over the policies of the club. The people who overthrew him were, almost to a man, Jacobins, themselves. The chief conspirator behind the scenes was Fouche‚Äô, a murdering dechristianizer; and the man who denounced Robespierre in the Convention was Tallien, who had recently returned from being a representative on mission.All of them had in way shape or form either helped create the machinery of, or participated in the Terror, but the point had been reached where even these men were afraid that they would be caught up in an intrigue that would spell their own doom. They knew it had to be stopped.

                Another report from deep in enemy territory.  I‚Äôve come to realize quite clearly that the Proggies today have no understanding that their wealth and comfort are far above basically any humans ever, and that a lot of it is an accident of time and place, and that they are inheritors of a culture and social environment that was centuries in the making.  Instead they prattle on about white privilege and are fascinated with democratic socialism.  They fail to understand that socialism means giving up control over your freedoms and your stuff to others, and those others are going to steal them blind.  It will all be taken from them, because they are the minority of the people who have all the stuff.  In the meantime, they live under a conceit that, because they are ‚Äúproper thinkers‚Äù, they will be spared.  Yeah, right.  The evil side of me (insert slow motion Grinch smile here) thinks that we need to put ourselves in the position of taking all the culture and all the stuff that they think they are willing to give up.  Or, more properly, that they think others will give up, not them.   I am not sure how to do it, but it all appears free for the taking.In the meantime, and here is where this comment aligns with teapartydoc‚Äôs comments, I have been thinking about the Tea Party.  It is important to remember that the Tea Party, basically a bunch of middle aged and older white people finally getting marginally politically involved and beginning to get organized, were put on a list by the government.  Lois Lerner was protected and rewarded for putting people on a list, in the name of the government.  Now the government creates such a list for only one thing, and that is to facilitate intimidation and arrest.  That is the only reason such a list exists, and it should terrify any thinking person.  Such a list takes us well down the path of the French Revolution.

                    Answering my own comment, but jeez, the Grinch thing has me thinking.  The Whos in Whoville believed in Santa Claus, and the Grinch simply inserted himself into the mix.  His failing was in going all sentimental, and the result was the Whos celebrating him.  Well, the Proggies are still going to wish us dead, no matter how generous and giving we might be (one could even argue that our obsequiousness would encourage them to double down against us), so we need to figure out how to be the Grinch, but not give in, in the end.

        This is a wonderful travel log and I hope it inspires many of your readers to consider a trip to Europe in the near future. Ignore the media‚Äôs rants about 3rd world garbage ruining it, that‚Äôs really only in the big cities and you don‚Äôt want to visit them especially with bus loads of tourists.The real beauty of Europe is not in the cities anyway. Especially German ones which were obliterated and rebuilt with horrible post-war architecture. It‚Äôs in the lesser traveled towns, villages and Dorfs where the average tourist never visits.Here‚Äôs where you will find the true heart and soul of Europe. Not in Paris or Munich (certainly not in Berlin ‚Äì Mein lieber Gott!) but in the countryside and back roads.Come over, rent a car and follow your nose! It‚Äôs not so big that you‚Äôll get lost and most of us speak English well enough you don‚Äôt need to worry. Just be polite, smile, learn to say ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in whatever country you visit as it will open many doors for you.Just for fun, try to find where your family came from. If you happen to have a  last name that‚Äôs the same as a town or region, you‚Äôll be surprised how people will immediately warm to you knowing someone from their village left for American many generations ago, and you have returned to see how everyone is doing.

        Maybe you should bundle all your travelogues into a short kindle book, mix in some photos with the text and have it be your version of ‚ÄúShakespeare Never Did This,‚Äù Bukowski‚Äôs book about travelling to Germany.

            A large portion of the population in the US has no net income tax liability. They might pay payroll taxes, sales taxes. The trend of increasing income inequality means that the rich will pay a growing share of taxes, even if rates are unchanged.
Anarcho-tyranny almost certainly would crack the whip hard on ‚Äútax-dodging Nazis‚Äù. In the leftist worldview, some billionaire WASP is paying the Zman. The only legal way to dodge tax is to not work, or work as little as possible. Consuming less is very helpful. Cancel your cable.

                        If you work for an employer, you pay taxes‚Äîala payroll deduction.  Taxes acquired via sales and such are really minor, but I agree, every little bit helps.  What really will make a difference is an underground economy.  Small communities where one works or produces for others in a sort of quid-pro-quo arrangement or cash below the table.  Something akin to a black market.  You can even still retain a tax paying job, just keep your official earnings below taxable levels.  Problem will be formally high earning jobs.  Youre standard of living will be greatly reduced.

                    Someone here mentioned barter. One of the problems with that has always been finding someone with exactly the right skills or products who also happens to want exactly the type of stuff you do or make. This weakness can be addressed by developing barter-like approaches to ‚Äúbig-ticket‚Äù needs. It might help to steal a page from the Amish here. We‚Äôve all hopefully heard of an Amish barn-raising party. That‚Äôs where you get a whole crew of Amish together to throw up a whole huge barn in about a day. I would propose that one way we could help free one another is to learn construction skills and have ‚Äúhouse-raising‚Äù parties. The dissident Right seems to have disproportionate numbers of people with high tech knowledge too so these need not be crude log cabins either. Think of 3d printed-in-place homes with an in-built sensor grid for the inevitable ‚Äúday of the zombie‚Äù. They would make a good advertisement for our side‚Äôs ingenuity and abilities to the normies as well.A few solutions to big ticket needs are probably easier than a lot of solutions to small ticket ones. Having our own ways of getting housing, transportation, food, etc‚Ä¶ means we can devote whatever taxable income we still need to earn in the coal mines of The Poz to whatever 4K computer monitors and Apple Hitler Phones we need to buy. This keeps our tax profile low and lets the high earning (and high tax paying) urban bugmen pay for the expanding welfare and police state.

                Working ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù is a viable option for many, especially those in the trades. Trick is to still declare just enough to avoid suspicion. Waiters do this every day.
Use your under-the-table earnings to purchase assets of value, like precious metals (these can be paid for in cash from many dealers) or rare collectibles (you need to know what you‚Äôre doing, however).
But the first priority is GET OUT OF DEBT and STAY OUT.

Change will only come when you really want it and are prepared to ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù personally. Only in this case, it is very likely that your life will actually improve‚Ä¶

                    The first point is: Change the narrative away from a consumption lifestyle towards a more ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô lifestyle. I mention sustainable because you can score brownie points with that on the left end of the political spectrum. Leading by example. If you can get a leftist away from the consumption style, you just won a minor victory over the left, even if they do not change their voting behaviour! This point is also called ‚Äòleading by example‚Äô.Second point: If everybody in the US would give you 1 dime, you would be rich. Yet nobody else would be really the poorer for it‚Ä¶ now in the reverse, if enough people would decide to forgo consumerism, the cumulative effect would be huge.Third point: It is about ‚Äúdoing the right thing‚Äù. It does not really matter what ‚Äòeverybody else does‚Äô. What matters is what YOU do. Do YOU live in accordance with your stated goals or don‚Äôt you? I find that most people on the alt-right are keyboard warriors. They talk a nice talk on some forum, but in real life? their neighbours usually don‚Äôt even know that they are alt-right! How can the world change if we are not even prepared to change our own lives?PS: This last point is a sore issue, because if we don‚Äôt change our lives, but just talk, then we could just as well be leftist. There is no discernible difference.

        Look, I broadly agree with everything you say here but until we solve to problem of being co-opted by other ‚ÄúRightists‚Äù,  organising is going to do jack shit. You can do all the organising you want but if the stormfags and the neocons are part of team Dissident Right its all going to implode.  Some ‚Äúpurity tests‚Äù need to be established if for no other reason to establish the goals that we want to achieve without being subverted from within.

        ‚ÄúDissident politics will have to be radical politics.‚ÄùI kind-of agree, but at the same time do not believe that accelerationism can significantly speed up the decline.I believe that permanent change can only come through economic pressure. But economic pressure in the sense of ‚Äúwhere do I get food tomorrow‚Äù. As long as production capacity exceeds this demand by a large factor, there is no need for change. And hence any sand you might throw into the gears of the economy will not reduce production capacity enough to force a change.Once production capacity only barely covers minimum demand, then any sand thrown into the gears will have immediate consequences.

            The sand does not necessarily have to be economic, but rather social and political.  Here behind enemy lines it is ridiculously easy to bait the lefties.  And the goal should be to bring out the crazy in them every day.  Two benefits‚Äìfirst it‚Äôs hard to sustain that tempo forever, you wear them out‚Äìand  you create space for a positive message on the other side.  You even see a little bit of these among the leftists‚Ä¶Mayor Buttplug gets traction in the Demo candidate mob simply because he doesn‚Äôt sound batshit crazy.

                        Given the Russian tactics and terrain think his shots were a combo platter of distances‚Äìsome very short‚ÄìHayha had stalking and tracking skills. But I recall he mostly had multiple kill days, so likely had to keep enough distance to get off multiple shots and make his escape and avoid counter snipers. He was also using short radius barrel mounted sights‚Äìwhich I‚Äôve always found increase the degree of difficulty.  I regularly shoot better groups with a tang mounted sight on a Savage 1899 (despite the lousy trigger) on the 100 yard range then guys next to me with ‚Äúequipment man‚Äù ARs.

Given the low number of daylight hours available during the Finnish winter, Hayha averaged about ONE KILL PER DAYLIGHT HOUR.
Hayha was put out of action by a Russian shot to his face.

            I think of ‚Äúorganization‚Äù around three models.  First is hierarchical and fairly rigid, layers and sub-branches.  Second is a ‚Äúcell‚Äù structure similar to what has been used in resistance movements. Third is more akin to flocking and migratory behavior in birds.  The goal would be some version that straddles the second and third.

                But what do you hope to achieve by organizing? In concrete terms?We‚Äôre getting the message out just fine without physical conferences and newspapers and workshops. Meatspace meetups are very 20th c ‚Äì keep the internet open and we will prevail. As some dude on the internet said, ‚Äúany unmoderated internet forum will turn right wing‚Äù.The internet is on our side, the internet always wins and the internet abhors organization. It‚Äôs like some 16th c. dissident arguing that clandestinely mass-produced leaflets and books are all good and well, but that we need to focus on shouting in town squares.The internet is a quantum leap in dissident technology, comparable only to the typeset press. The MSM is already burning; assome Swedish guy on the internet said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no law of nature saying you need to have journalists.‚Äù (Subtitled)

                With the surveillance tools available to the Deep state a cell structure is almost unavoidable. They have recorded and stored every communication every credit card transaction and more for the last 20 years. Moreover, they have now developed powerful algorithms to help them sort through this huge mass of data. they easily broke up all the secret societies down here in the south and that was before these tools became available to them. Bears thinking upon.

                    The only way any underground group can survive is to have no electronic footprint whatsoever. This is what various MC gangs do. The Feds try like hell to bust them and it goes nowhere.
In one case  out of sheer desperation they resorted to murdering a bunch of them in Waco Texas when  they got together for a meeting.

        serious question:How do you square this:
&gt;That is, no authentic alternative movement is going to succeeded by being negative. Positive identity has staying power and it naturally attracts people to it. A movement that is nothing but a laundry list of grievances only attracts misfits and trouble makers. That cannot be said enough‚Ä¶
With this:https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/04/09/iranian-lawmakers-open-parliament-with-death-to-america-chants/
?
Is there more staying power to a movement founded on hate than we realize?

            Our rulers will open their cult meetings with ‚Äúdeath to white people‚Äù chants soon enough.

        As long as bond rates are low, nothing matters. That‚Äôs the measure most directly related to the herd‚Äôs somnolent grazing in the pasture despite the smell of a firestorm just over the hill. As long as people remain so stoned they can barely pass the ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs Awesome‚Äù bong, toking on ‚ÄúResources are Unlimited, Man‚Äù weed, nothing is going to change.It‚Äôs all related. It‚Äôs the product of a social mood mania of unprecedented amplitude and duration. It looks like an unending trend because after 40-60 years, that‚Äôs just what happens. It will end, if for no other reason than the arithmetic finally fails and the most-stoned neighbors will literally begin to die off from their complacency in numbers that finally matter. If we have to wait that long for the trend to end, however, daylight may well not be visible above us due to the depth of the hole we‚Äôll occupy.As long as long term debt yields next to nothing, as long as no crisis arrives, this clown parade will not change course.

        We call ourselves ‚Äòdissident right‚Äô. Why not just ‚Äòdissident‚Äô? In our time there can only be one ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô point of view; I can‚Äôt say exactly what it is, as it changes from week to week, except that if you don‚Äôt agree on a daily basis with Stephen Colbert‚Äôs daily witticisms on NPR, then you are probably failing to absorb the correct line.Thought experiment: You are a hard-core communist, as W. Chambers was at one time. But you regard abortion as a crime against Nature and God (or even just Nature). In all other respects you are full-in on re-education camps, nighttime shootings in the Lubyanka, extermination of the antisocial elements, etc.This makes you ‚Äòdissident‚Äô right‚Äô, or indeed simply dissident. Dissident Left used to be a thing: Orwell of course, Chambers, Koestler, Irving Kristol‚Ä¶ come to think of it, Bukharin, Rykov, etc.The point being, we embrace as brothers EVERYONE who agrees that the ‚ÄòOfficial Line‚Äô is the enemy of thought. At a guess I could have a more interesting conversation in Hell with Pol Pot than with, say, Gloria Steinhem or JK Rowling.

            I suppose it is hard to be ‚Äòleft-deviationist‚Äô nowadays; my examples weren‚Äôt good ‚Äì they were all right-deviationists, calling for some scrap of human decency (bourgeois morality). But one could still be a left-deviationist: that Islamic broad from Minnesota is a good example. As I understand the term, ‚Äòleft-deviationism‚Äô is an unfortunate candor about the direction of things: It‚Äôs what unpersoned Syme in 1984 for example. He lacked that ‚Äòsaving stupidity‚Äô, as Smith noted, that would keep him alive. He did things that drew attention from his keepers, and it cost him. He believed TOO MUCH. Bad for future changes of line ‚Äì can‚Äôt have Symes around who are too into the line of yesterday.So, at this point I would say that Left-deviation is merely that combination of brutality and plain language that we‚Äôve seen coming from the rulers of South Africa. There is something both chilling ‚Äì yet liberating ‚Äì to hear your enemies say ‚ÄúOur goal is to kill you and steal your property.‚Äù You know where you stand, at least until the US media rubs all the edges down and explains that it isn‚Äôt what they mean, that you misunderstand them, that your racism is to blame, that you have an irrational fear of black people, that you can be cured of this by 25 new families in your town from darkest Africa‚Ä¶
