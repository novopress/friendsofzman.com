        Obama could care less about oil, but the Europeans do a lot.    You will usually find French and German firms selling their industrial wares to the most  unsavory clients.  Welfare states cost a lot to keep barely afloat.  They also know that Iran actually has a few Hiroshima sized nuclear weapons (as do we) and figure the Arab/Persian arms race is inevitable (see the Wikipedia entry on the South African nuclear program for how a small enrichment plant can do the job in only a few years.   Iâ€™ve met some of the South Africans involved and its quite true).   Obama figures he has some magic sense of South Asian politics (not Indian anyway) and will be rewarded for some deal of any kind.    Other Progressives go along because it sticks the Reagan era USA for past sins and the Bush era for military action.  Any sense of a regional threat to US and Western interests cannot be taken up as it would require hard choices.
