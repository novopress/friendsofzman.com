        Good luck convincing the Goodwhites to identify as white people &amp; care about the wellbeing of other white people.They want to be perceived as moral &amp; to enjoy high social status.Currently, morality &amp; status are defined by the universities &amp; disseminated through the media. Both of those institutions are dominated by people who see normal straight white gentiles as the enemy.We need a parallel set of institutions that say it is moral &amp; high-status to care about white people’s wellbeing. And a separate  media to disseminate those standards. Then we need to take over, infiltrate or destroy the anti white institutions. Any other to-do list is wasting our time &amp; energy.The bad news is that is a heavy lift. The good news is that Goodwhites are lemmings &amp; will quickly shift to conform to the new status hierarchy.

        I honestly wonder if they CAN learn.  For instance, when I started living in a college town, it was wonderful — all the benefits of diversity without, you know, Diversity, as anyone darker than Vladimir Putin wore a letter jacket and lived in a separate dorm.  Then the eggheads decided we needed more Diversity and began the furious importation of the nearest major metro’s ghetto.  Now all the craft boutiques have burglar bars on them and you can’t walk around outside at night.  To top it all off, some deep-cover shitlord in the zoning office briefly redrew the school districts so that the kids in the Faculty Ghetto went to class in the ghetto ghetto.  White flight?  At about Mach fucking three… after which they regrouped, and began griping just as loud about the lack of Diversity in Our Schools.Which would be bad enough, but the service class in the town — the small business owners who are parasitic on the college ecosystem — have enough skin in the game to know better, but they go along with it.  They’d rather go out of business than acknowledge the obvious.  A conservative used to be a liberal who got mugged, but Lefties these days are waaaaay more masochistic.  I don’t think it’s gonna happen.

            I think that is going to depend on how badly they get abused for their decisions – and HOW.One of the problems I see with “whites”  – is that the goodwhites are not fully held to account for their stupidity by the badwhites.This (unfortunately) usually means confrontations on a personal basis in my experience. Which gets tiring and old after a while for all except the most masochistic of badwhites.  From what I’ve typically seen:  badwhites just separate from the goodwhites and self-isolate to get away from the leftist craziness.Somewhere along the line 15-20 years ago – the leftists pissed me off badly enough that I came to the conclusion that one of the best ways to get back at them – ) because they do the exact thing you’re referring to I.E. – never learning)  – was to steer away from making logical arguments and trying to sway their opinions – and rather just concentrate on making them feel badly and injecting misery into their lives.I’ve found the strategy to work pretty well – but it’s tiring, leads to a lot of arguments, means I have to REALLY keep up on current events (requires a lot of time and I don’t always have the best encylopedic memory recall) – etc.One of my best ones was during the election cycle leading up to Obama’s first term in office.  One of the office liberals sat down at our lunch table and asked who everybody was voting for.  When it came my turn I said ” I hope Obama wins”.  His face lit up and he said “why?” with a happy tone in his voice.  I said ” because the way I see it electing Obama will pretty much destroy left wing liberalism in this country and take out the Democrat party at the same time – seems like a win win to me”.Then I looked down and took another bite of my sandwich.  A couple of the guys I was sitting with (all pretty much right leaning) – were cracking up laughing.  I looked over and the left wing guy was walking away – and he never said a word. One of my buddies said ” Wow – you REALLY pissed him off – his face turned beet red and the veins were bulging out of his neck”.I never talked to the leftie again. He wouldn’t talk to me the whole rest of the time we worked there together.I considered that mission accomplished.  By one simple retort I injected a bunch of misery into his life.  Obviously he had no reply to my response.  What the hell could he say? ” I don’t think that will happen”  ???  Weak sauce.Best part of that exchange was that it pretty much came true.  I should go find the guy and send him a letter and see how he likes me now.Point here is though:  I probably couldn’t count one “conservative” or “right winger” in 20 that I know – who would have even attempted that response (at that point in time) .  The typical strategy was always debate debate debate.  And the debate points and retorts during arguments were always pretty lame.  “Muh Constitution!!” – being one of the usual ones.This is why the rise of the alt-right sort of caught me by surprise.  Much of what I’ve seen unfold over the last couple of years was ” holy crap it’s like these guys are in my head” type of stuff.  The constant out-meming of the left is a great thing.  It proves people on the right are finally THINKING.In the end though – I don’t think that we’re ever going to bury the eggheads and their followers in the “goodwhite” crowd – without getting in their faces and shutting them down in person.  Bitching on the internet is good – but pissing off your co-workers and risking getting thrown out of New Years Eve parties because you just pissed off your gay neighbor’s friends is where the war is really going to be fought.

        Rather than asking the usual “code questions” that Steve Sailer and Jared Taylor talk about (“Is the neighborhood high crime?” etc.) I can probably glean the same info by asking, “Does the basketball team lose a lot?” If the answer is yes, then I’m that much closer to utopia.Re: the goodwhite presence in the Southwest, it’s kind of a dirty secret, but when rich New England whites have kids who are total fuckups (not fit for inheritance even by right of primogeniture because they’ve totaled cars and done a lot of drugs) their parents send them to these weird detox centers/cum boarding schools out there (my friend whose mom married into money was placed in one of these things in Sedona, Arizona and he hipped me to this whole “Outward Bound/I’m taking five credits at Naropa” bullshit.) These Boston Brahman don’t want their dirty laundry aired when their gallery opening or fundraiser gets crashed by their drunk son plowing people over with a golf cart. Still, there’s a bit of Montezuma’s revenge with reports coming in that goodwhite kids who spend all day with Spanish nannies end up sounding more like Julio Caesar Chavez than William Buckley. You get called “Mijo” enough by Marisol and you start to think she’s your mom.

            A close friend’s niece got kicked out of her lovely NE boarding school for booze/drugs a few yrs ago and ended up in one of the SW Arizona? detox establishments you described.  Her grandpa was shelling out practically a Yale tuition for her stay.  She eventually got thrown out of that too when her bottle was found in the cactus landscape out front of the Admin building!  It was sad, though, because she had been molested by a family member for years, so she was certifiably messed up.  She’s been on the mend and got her life straightened out thru AA and other programs that she has to take charge of herself!  I wish her well.  Her parents are nice people, but s#%^t happens to the best of us.

        Anyone notice where barry HUSSEIN o’commie and family vacation?Yep, in lily white locales populated by white millionaires and white billionaires.Notice where his kids are going to college? I don’t think that any of the traditional black colleges (e.g., Howard University ), could offer any sort of scholarship that would have ocommie suggest to his kids that they should attend college where they can rub elbows and bootie with their bros and sistas.And isn’t/wasn’t  ocommies daughter “working” for a bunch of white folks in a white owned enterprise in Manhattan. You can bet it was not located in 125th Street and St. Nicholas Ave.HUSSEIN ocommie will hang out with his millionaire / billionaire bros and sistas for very, very short periods of time  to hear them rap, sing and complain about how racist the USA is. Then he jets back to the lily white enclaves of the uber  white rich to consort with the “oppressors” of his bros and sistas.I would be curious to see articles in  black magazines (Jet? ) listing their best places to live or best places to vacation.Montana anyone?

        Being a realist means being realistic about everything, and in particular, being realistic about the stuff that is antithetical to your world view. For example, the gentrified whites that are described in this post are not going to change their stripes because someone accurately elucidates reality to them. Core beliefs and attitudes are hard-wired early in life and will persist stubbornly despite intelligent discourse proving otherwise. This is the nature of the battlefield.

        Most underrated fun during the primary season in ’16 was watching Bernie dance around gun control.  His entire state has the peculiar demographic pointed out here.  One can freely buy and carry a handgun open or concealed with no permit, no limits (outside of Federal) on types of long arms one can own.  Yet, by some miracle, the state doesn’t resemble Deadwood Writ Large.  Wonder why?

            Two reasons: the liberals are full of beans about guns causing crime – but everyone knows that. The second is that there are probably no blacks in Bernie’s home state, I’m guessing.As a gun hound I have skin in the gun debate. I once watched an NRA presentation where they made a map of states with the most restrictive gun laws, and another map with of states with the highest crime. They virtually overlapped when laid atop one another.I wonder if a map with states that have high black populations would too? I’m almost willing to bet they would…. but that’s hatey isn’t it. Maybe I shouldn’t a thunk it…

                The Bureau of Justice statistical database will give you all that.  But just to Cliff Note it, if you are not: black, male, between the ages of 13-34, and don’t live in one of the 25 or so major metros, your risk from gun violence is about the same as pre-ISIS Europe.  Oops.

            First heard about the deep antipathy towards BLM and the Feds in general twenty years ago from an uncle that ran a business in southern Montana.  Micromanaged everything but knew nothing.  Wouldn’t listen to the locals on staff, everything was run by newly minted PhDs in “environmental sciences” from the east or California.  He ran an outfitting business and the Feds were always closing or restricting access to areas with no warning and no explanation.  Frequently would do the same to ranchers who depended on hundred year old access rights across Federal land to reach pasture and grazing land.

                Vin Suprynowicz has been writing about the abuses of the Feds and specifically the BLM since at least the 90’s.  It’s probably been 15 years since I read his books “Send in the Waco Killers” and ” The Ballad of Carl Drega”, and they had a lasting effect.  I wasn’t really familiar with how pissed off many people out west are at Federal government policies.  The fractured-west article posted by Newrouter hits all the same points I remember Suprynowicz making in his books.  So apparently not much has changed.If you wanted a primer on getting pissed off at the crap the Federal government pulls – those two books are an excellent place to start.And Vin is out of Nevada if my memory serves me correctly – so the antipathy to the BLM is something that seems to run across the west country pretty pervasively and isn’t just confined to just one state.

        Over the Festering Period I was at a gathering of my wife’s very large family, pretty evenly split between higher ed types, private sector jobbed- a couple in sales, and own business entrepreneurs. I had  occasion to drop the line  “Play the white man ” to one of the teens who was being unusually greedy, even for a teen. The reactions ranged from the gobsmacked, the smirking and the laughing.Too a man they fell into the prescribed groups.

            I do wish I could have been there bile. I must have been a hoot.
By the way, Scuzza and I still wish you would join Twitter someday so we could keep track of you.
Happy New Year to you and all that crazy family.

        Looking around the world at stable, functional 1st world societies I’ve noticed they have all been heavily influenced by western civilization–which is another way of saying they have been influenced by white Christian culture. Except for Japan (influenced by missionaries after WW2) I cannot think of a single non-white open, classical liberal 1st world country. Anybody have suggestions?

            Take Japan back to the Mejii restoration.  Effectively they looked at Western civ as a big shopping mall and went on a spree buying the best each country had to offer in the drive to modernize.  South Korea, similar story post 1954.  Ditto Iran from 50s to 1979.  Simply look at the GDP data for each country.

        “Non-hispanic white” is a clouding term injected into the immigration/identity arena to confuse white people.  I have met Argentinians and Mexicans who are stone cold white.  No further analysis necessary.
The term causes your average north am gringo to pause and puzzle as he sorts through people from south of the Rio.  The intent by the jew-oh-sphere is of course to keep whites off balance

            I like the term “Conquistador Americans” for the South American ruling class. There’s also the fact that the El Norte Mexicans are 85% European, while Mexicans in the central and southern part of the country are 85% Amerind. Not all Hispanics are the same and not all Mexicans are the same.

                California has recently seen a type of Mexican blowing in like tumbleweed that they cannot comprehend–sub-five foot Indians. No Spanish, very low IQ, no skills and no way to communicate. Of course, what is actually needed is not communication but a strong north wind.

                    That great humanitarian, proponent of human rights and  all-around nice guy,  Che Guevara described Mexicans as “a rabble of illiterate Indians.”In general, Latin Americans of European stock (or mostly Euro stock) consider indigenous inhabitants (i.e., indians)  of Latin America as inferior.There is racism in Latin America and you will note that indigenous Latin Americans are rarely seen amongst the political and/or business elites of  Latin America.As for the Latin American illegals sneaking into the USA, they are almost all indigenous peoples; i.e., those held in contempt by the Euro-ethnic ruling elites of Latin America.IMHO, the elites, esp. of Mexico and Central America would welcome the emigration of ALL of their indigenous people out of their nations.And check out all those drug related killings in Mexico; those killed and those doing the killing are almost all indigenous indians.The ruling Euro-stock elites of Mexico have no qualms that the indians there are killing each other (sort of how the democrats in Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, etc.,  have no problem with their blacks killing blacks).Want to get into a real pickle?Ask an Argentine or Cuban or Chilean here in the USA, “are you Puerto Rican?”

            I had a guy with two Argentinian emigre parents (doctors) who refused to identify as “Hispanic” for HR purposes.  He simply had zero identification other than speaking perfect Castilian Spanish.  I had to instruct another employee later on who was half-Mexican that he damn well would since being elected a Vice President in our firm depended on it (diversity quotas you know) The Cubans I grew up with considered most of the rest of the New World Hispanics to be the equivalent of trailer trash.  Its complicated.

                    An interesting episode that is somewhat understudied outside South America is the War of the Pacific where Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia despite being significantly outnumbered. One of the reasons that is mentioned is that they have a significantly higher percentage of Amerindians than Chile. It’s amazing how race conscious Latin Americans are as a whole.

                        Also meant to add the time my EA, who was an otherwise perfectly nice, efficient, decently educated and from Puerto Rico started coming in chronically late.  Had a little sit down.  So what comes pouring out?  Turns out her sister (and roommate) got involved with “one of those fucking Dominican assholes who was abusing her, because all fucking Dominicans are low life animals”  (that was the gist of it)  Apparently that was another level in the Caribbean Hispanic pecking order I was not aware of.  Mind you, i’d never heard a word of profanity in the prior two years.

                San Francisco’s black population is half what is was in 1985.  Why?  Partly due to the insanely high cost of housing.  But everyone faces the same costs so that alone does not explain why so many black residents left.  What it really comes down to is what Z Man was referring to above; most white liberals are not at all comfortable with being around blacks in their neighborhoods or schools except in small numbers.  It’s all about having your cake and eating it too, i.e. virtue signaling on race relations and at the same time keeping the “dangerous elements” away from one’s family and loved ones.

        Just live somewhere at high altitude and with lots of snow. Pretty much any destination ski town will do. Then, fly back to your official residence in the city on your own private plane. This pretty much captures the subscription list and pass-along readership for AD Magazine.

            How about joining a yacht club?  These used to be snobbish institutions, with clear and strict divisions along ethnic/religious groupings, but they now appear very welcoming to anyone with an interest in the sport of sailing, especially young families.  Even your local marina, with power boats, large and small, seems devoid of diversity for the most part.  We’re not talking Palm Beach here, either.

        I can’t remember where, but I have read that Architectural Digest is a place where a communist who finds himself out of work for a while can find refuge. You have to write a bunch of stuff that you find distasteful, but they pay you to travel, and this covers some of your meet ups.

            I thought that’s what outfits like National Review were for, back in the days.  Since being outed as a conservative would blackball you from an academic career forever, the kind of tweedy dorks that would otherwise teach Poli Sci at the nearest cow college would write articles for Buckley like “Whither Gambia? A Free-Market Approach.”  But these days National Review is indistinguishable from boilerplate faculty-lounge liberalism, so that’s out….

                        The big complaint against the establishment right is that they were libs on a lag. That they eventually reconciled themselves to the lefty agenda, but that at the time the left made the initial move, they just weren’t ready for it, but eventually succumbed.This played into the idea of an avant garde and the linear progression of society, the Whig view of history, which is, in part, one traditional aspect of conservatism (this is in part tied to the natural law side of conservatism, see Ancient Law, by Henry Sumner Maine.) In this mode, one can foresee an end point to the “progression”, which is really a return to a more primitive ideal, and a particular direction in which the “progress” should be made. One way to look at what happened to the beltway conservatives is that they allowed themselves to lose sight of this and let themselves be led by the nose rather unconsciously by the left. Had they not repudiated the southern agrarian aspect of conservatism, they might have avoided this. Maybe.One of those mental masturbatory topics for an ISI conference that no one goes to any more.

        The people with the most acute cases of Trump Derangement syndrome I know of live in Arlington and Newburyport, MA. I grew up in the vibrant neighborhood of West Medford across the river from East Arlington in the late 70’s and 80’s. The Arlington and MDC cops always seemed to have a reason to post details on the bridges out of Medford into Arlington, even before Arlington was taken over by cambridge weirdos. West Medford has gentrified into a carbon, well non-carbon, copy of Arlington, somerville, cambridge, vermont, etc. I enlisted in the service after high school and moved to NH when my active duty was up. I had had enough diversity, inclusion and vibrancy by the age of 22. I still have relatives in Arlington, it’s fun to wear a Blackwater USA hat or jacket when I visit.

            It won’t work alas. The higher classes have everything anyone could want materially so all they can do is compete on petty bullshit  and  virtue signalingIts pretty much a dopamine  addiction for them.Also they mostly hate the lower class Whites, preferring Hispanics or sometimes well behaved BlacksThis is because they lack basic humility, instead of “there but for the grace of God go I” the presence of the White lower class makes a lot of them profoundly uncomfortable feeling like they are phoniesWhen it comes to the working class, especially the trades this is actually quite true. Our upper class aren’t terribly smart and aren’t smarter than any of the hundreds of skilled rednecks I’ve met over the yearsMy guess is baring an application of a boot to their asses either by some kind of nationalists state , a rebellion or most likely an economic collapse they are going to keep on being  the way they are.Also while its undoubtedly true they go to church more t than average, so did the Pharisees Same assholes different time.

        I stayed in the city long after my other friends had moved out. Anytime I bitched about having the car broken into or trash and loud music friends now living in the suburbs would scold me for being a racist.
A co-worker said turn it around the next time they start with that business. Just remind them they live in lillywhite suburbia and you chose to stay in a multicultural setting.
Put an end to that nonsense but they still find other stuff to drone on about. Black lives matter,  racist statues, etc.

        Z I am sure you’ve seen today’s WSJ but this just takes the cake:https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-informed-civility-is-the-latest-target-in-the-campus-wars-1514938758—“Civility, you see, is a manifestation of the white patriarchy. Spearheading this campaign are a duo of University of Northern Iowa professors, who assert that “civility within higher education is a racialized, rather than universal, norm.”Their article in the Howard Journal of Communications, “Civility and White Institutional Presence: An Exploration of White Students’ Understanding of Race-Talk at a Traditionally White Institution,” describes a need to stamp out what they call “whiteness-informed civility,” or WIC. The pervasiveness of WIC, it seems, erases “racial identity” and reinforces “white racial power.”—The question is, how do we continue to promote awareness of pieces like this (from a very mainstream paper) in order to act as the boatman across the river. Any advice?

            Anger is unresolved incapacity, and although it’s better to be angry when you are beating a man to death, incivility is best put aside in the planning stages. Burke wrote that a defect in comprehension is furthered by a malignancy in disposition. This explains much IMO.

            I can’t read beyond the first few sentences of the WSJ article you linked to.
The thought that came to my mind was “Civilization:  It’s a white thing.  You wouldn’t understand.”
I don’t think that blacks and whites can continue to live together in the same country.  We could in the past because white gentiles were on top, set the moral tone of society and enforced the rules.  Not anymore.

        Really, there is nothing new here.  Any observant, objective and rational person long ago noted that most white liberals are very good at virtue signaling on matters like race relations while living and acting in very different ways.  Not a few of the black race baiter politicians have noted in private and occasionally in public that white liberal politicians are condescending to them (understandable on some levels) and expect black votes simply because black voters have “no other options.”One unmistakeable trend you see in modern American society is that as a ROUGH general rule the more formal and better education a black person has, the more likely they are NOT to vote Democrat.  These educated black men and women learn through their education to recognize the hypocrisy and blatant racism that still permeates the American Left and the policy failures.  This is scary for the American Left because their greatest fear is that the black bloc vote will go away, or least no longer be a guaranteed percentage for Democratic politicians.  x The Left expends no small effort discouraging black voters from not voting as a bloc.  If one steps outside that mentality, they are instantly labeled a “race traitor” or some other term to bring them back into the fold or to minimize the damage they can do.
