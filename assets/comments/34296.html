        End of an era, though there have been rumors of Derb’s imminent retirement for some time. I’m a long time listener. I can say i learned a lot about the dissident right ecosystem, and indeed I think I first heard about the Zman, on Radio Derb.
Thank you, Sir, for all you’ve done so far, and though we disagree on some (mostly zio) things, I will continue to look for your articles, wherever they might appear.
Best of luck to you and all your family!

        I’ve been enjoying Radio Derb for I don’t know how many years, but I’ve been listening since it was hosted at National Review. It’s hard to imagine a world without a weekly Radio Derb, but I suppose, like so many other good things these days, it had to end eventually.
Godspeed Derb, and thanks for the many hours of interesting and insightful commentary. May you enjoy your well deserved retirement.

        Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs.
For God’s sake, let us sit upon the groundAnd tell sad stories of the death of pundits;How some have been deposed by NRO, some slain in Twitter wars,Some haunted by their epic “The Talk”;Some poison’d by their editors, some by NY DA lawfared,
Derb did lead me to Zman, but Derb was always more than that. A perfect gentleman, the driest of dry sense of humor, consistent across the decades, and a realist (We. Are. Doomed).
I’m going to miss his place on the public square.

        I started listening from program number one to now. Goes back to the National Review years. At 1000 a fitting end. Over the years I somewhat found myself through your writing. Thank you.
Happy Trails Derb.

        My heart sank when I learned that this was the last installment of Radio Derb. Then I was happy for our metaphorically ink-stained wretch who will now be emancipated from his time in the salt mines.This was also the first podcast I listened to. I don’t believe they were called podcasts then.We’ve always had dogs. I have walked two generations of dogs on Saturday mornings while listening to our dear friend. We’ll be getting a new puppy in a few weeks. The third generation will not know their master’s Saturday morning pleasure.Our Venn diagrams overlap considerably. I lived in California and refereed rugby for many years and was a member of the East Midlands referee Society, spending two weeks a year for a dozen years in Northampton plying my amateur trade there.You have had a good innings, sir, with acquaintances from Bruce Lee to the Z Man.Grow old along with methe best is yet to beThe last of life for which the first was madeOur time is in his handsWho saith a whole I planned.Youth shows but half; trust God, nor be afraid

        goodbye Mr. Derbyshire! You have been my weekly companion for ever so long!  Happy birthday and thank you for the years of entertainment and good sense you have given us all! You are truly one of a kind and irreplaceable! May you and Mrs. Derb live a long retirement and neither predecease the other but turn into an oak an elm like baucis and Philemon! Best wishes to you and your family!

        As a very long-time listener, I wish you a happy retirement and many thanks for years of wonderful articles and podcasts. They were a pleasure.
And make no mistake, you changed the thinking of more people than you can imagine. Indeed, I’d argue that you played an important role in the changing of national zeitgeist that has pushed back on the Woke totalitarianism that was rolling across our country.
Well done, sir. Well done.

        It is sad to read this will be your last podcast but be happy with the rest of your life. It was a pleasure to listen to you over the years, and your enjoyable podcast–the first I followed, was brought to a classy close. Thanks for the 1,000 programs you did give to us.

        Since Derb is a mathematician by training, I wonder if he’d be interested to weigh in on what should be a simple mathematical (actually, actuarial) question posed on yesterday’s Zman blog. The question surrounds how many Holocaust survivors are still alive today.I used figures found from the Wikipedia article “Holocaust survivors.” Reader “Anna” gave numbers not far different. My interest (and, I admit, I did much of the replying thee) was simply this question:Given a starting population of 3.5 million “Holocaust survivors” in 1945 (what seems an official claim), can we really expect to have about 245,000 survivors (in 2024, also an “official” claim)?I’m just an amateur with actuarial reckoning. Just the same, based on a few google queries and using SSA life tables, the 245,000 claim is within the realm of possibility with two very dubious assumptions: One, that modern life expectancies were operant in 1945 (probably not – we live perhaps 17 years longer today than the population did in 1945) and more interestingly, that the 245,000 survivor figure only holds true if the entire population of 3.5 million had a mean age of &lt; 15 in 1945.If one uses the much lower life expecancy from late 1930s, the 245,000 figure (7% remains of original population) becomes even more untenable.I don’t doubt there are a few survivors still alive, but not many. Roughly speaking they’re the same age as WW II vets, the absolute youngest of which would have to be about 97 right now.Interestingly, other readers seemed to accept the 245,000 figure.

            Most Jews consider themselves to be Holocaust survivors now. Older people may not know this, but if you talk to younger Jews — like the woman who flipped out at Max Blumenthal of The Greyzone at a foreign policy event this week — they will physically attack you for questioning their self-ascribed identity.It hasn’t helped to have Derb’s generation encasing this in stone for 50 years, giving “a pass” because, well, technically, if she had been near Hitler he would’ve killed her — maybe that’s the thinking behind such generosity. Either way, questioning them in person will lead to physical violence and likely an arrest. It shows the deistic powers they ascribe to Hitler, in that every Jew for the rest of time will be a survivor of his attempt to apparently wipe them from the earth. It is a deeply powerful religious impulse at work that Christians simply cannot comprehend unless they encounter it repeatedly.

                Yes, I’ve met a Jew[ess] or two in my life who let it be known [s]he was the child or perhaps it was grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, in much the same way that a Yale or Harvard almumni will let you know, within the first five minutes of meeting him/her.

                Our fabulous Derb signing off with the observation that “Europeans might end up speaking Russian!” is surely the end of an era, and a harbringer of fraught hope to come.

            Retraction: I did some further googling and guess what? My earlier “analysis” (on Friday’s Z blog) was in error. I posted multiple retractions as needed. So Derb, or anybody else, please don’t bother checking my incorrect rantings. Turns out I was way off estimating the average age of survivors in 1945. I’d figured mid-30s, but I found estimates closer to 8 years old. I was amazed how young. I also found some German Life tables from 1940s that, if I read them correctly, seem to support Anna’s (or Wikipedia’s) claims that yes, there really are ~200,000 Holocaust survivors still alive. In brief: it turns out that most of them aren’t 125 years old as I’d first thought, thinking I’d uncovered the Lesser Hoax of the Twentieth Century. Yes, they’re old farts now, but more likely in their late 80s.

                Obviously it depends on how you define “survivor.” There were very few survivors of the camps themselves- I once saw the number 100,000- and the minimum age there was, maximum, 12 or so. (Passing for older in those cases. A former chief rabbi of Israel is a bizarre exception, having been hidden in a camp when he was 7.) So any camp survivor would be well into his or her 90’s by now.But then there are all sorts of others, like babies who had to run off like the woman Derb mentioned. So under that definition there may still be “survivors” who are 81 or so.200,000 still alive…yeah, maybe.

        Derb, I have been reading your stuff religiously for at least a quarter-century. When the issues of NR used to come in the mail the very first thing I would do is flip to the last page and read your column.You are a towering figure on the dissident right, intelligent, insightful, witty, wry, humble, literate, and with an incredible breadth of knowledge. Trulysui generisin the best of ways. We have learned so much from you. It was easy to take your prolific output for granted — Derb would always be right there with the most penetrating and incisive analysis.But we all get older. Time is short. The world remains governed by fools and we have other things to attend to. I thank you profusely for sharing your insights with us all these years, please continue to write as long as you are willing and able.

        I started reading Derb in NR which I discovered in high school in the late eightiesI followed him out after his defenestration &amp; came here many years ago due to his endorsementHis intelligence, wit, polymathic curiosity and overall character made his podcast the only one of which I can honestly say I listened to every episodeHe will be missed because he can’t be replaced but I wish him the most peaceful enjoyment of family and friends and the sincere gratitude of his faithful reader and listener

        Mr. Derbyshire, you have been a regular in my podcast lineup since the NRO days. I imagine I have read a couple dozen books based on your reviews and recommendations. If not for you, I would never have encountered Simon Leys or Tete-Michel Kpomassie. In fact this week I’ve been reading Leys’ translation ofThe Analects.
As a retired math teacher, I have always enjoyed your math corner challenges.
Enjoy your retirement Sir! I’ll look forward to your miscellaneous future writings.

        So long, Mr. Derbyshire. I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed reading your comments on Vdare over many years. I learned so much from you. Without a doubt, the most important thing I ever learned from you was one time, during the very dark days of open borders, when you admonished your readers that we should remember that the Bible teaches us that it is a sin to despair. That cheered me up, and I never forgot it. I also remember one time I was on a website and people in the comment section we’re talking bad about you and comparing you to other people they didn’t like and someone responded that of course you are a terrible person and just as bad as the other person they mentioned but at least you knew how to write. That made me laugh. No matter what your spiteful mutant critics can say about you, they can never say that you are not an amazing writer.As always, better days are ahead, and thanks for fighting, my friend.

        How ’bout that–Derb and I have something in common. I, too, count my age in days (27711 today). I do it so I have a suitable answer when the telemarketers for Medicare plans and life insurance ask me my age.
I’ll miss Radio Derb, but at least he hasn’t gone the way of Jerry Pournelle, another writer I sorely miss.

                No, but not my 80th either. When that time comes (assuming I make it that far), my day number will be the same 29221 as Derb’s was.

        Oh, my.  Another unwanted milestone passed.  I knew it would hapen eventually, either as a result of retirement or… you know.  But knowledge of an impending event does not diminish its impact and sometimes, amplifies it.  I have been a fan of The Derb for a long time, and always found his insights useful, often humorous and never banal.  I must also confess a streak of envy at his mathematical skills, which I sorely lack.  (That’s why I found myself in law school upon graduation from university.  I had acquired no useful skills during my sonambulation through college, so law school was a natural fit.)  Well, it was good, usually very good, while it lasted, and thanks for all that.  Happy trails, Derb.

        You should hear John Podhoretz on his podcast these days. A fire-breathing “deport them all” type now. I guess we take what we can, but as someone who was subject to attacks from him as well, it’s a bit distasteful that he’s only waking up *now*. It wasn’t obvious before?

                Like a lot of “conservatives” (and I suppose others) who jump on popular causes, they support it only so long as they can do so without feeling unpopular at Beltway cocktail parties. Usually all it takes is a media push informing them that they’re Nazis or something.

        “I’ve learned a lot from them that’s improved my understanding, and I flatter myself that they may have learned something from me.”
No need to flatter yourself- it is true.
“those mutual improvements in understanding will keep me and my followers bonded together at some level above the everyday transactional.”
Amen.
Wishes for many more years of enjoyment of the important things in life, as you described, with thanks and appreciation.

        Mr. Derbyshire, I shall miss your &lt;i&gt;Radio Derb&lt;/i&gt; whose conclusion forms a hole in  however many forthcoming Saturdays which God may will for me to live. It has been a sterling pleasure to have made your cyberacquaintance, and I pray God bless you in enjoyment of your other pursuits and especially in enjoyment of your family.

        Mr. Derbyshire,  I will miss your weekly musings.  One of two or three podcasts that I have faithfully listened to for years.  Others came and went as their schtick got old and tired, I never tired of yours.  Thanks for all the years of entertainment and may you enjoy the extra time with your family and your hobbies.
