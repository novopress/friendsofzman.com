        I guess I can see the “church like” aspect you mention of some of the TED talks. But what interests me most about them is the technologies they showcase.

I attended a Landmark Forum event (week-long) back in the early 90’s, and got real enduring value out of it. Very glad I attended. And I guess I can see how people could get “religious” over it. To me it was a good mental toolkit for improving your life.
Is that ‘religious’?

        Very astute. It’s very difficult not to end up with a religion of some kind, as pretty much everyone has to take certain things on faith. The problem is when you fail to see it. What today’s progressives fail to see is what they see as innovative and new when it comes to morality and values is virtually always an old heresy come back to life.

        “The fact that no one ever mentions the similarities says something, I suspect, about our increasingly hostile relationship with the past.”I’m  not sure about that.  I think EST and its competitors pretty much dropped off the cultural radar by the late 90s.  I also think that the attendant vocabulary (“Getting” it, etc.) became diffused into the general culture about the same. I suspect there is enough reference material about than someone could  put together a similar venue without having to re-invent the wheel.Those trainings offered a take on things that, for me at least, had a great amount of “value”. (Another vocab term.)  And yes, there is a strong strain of it  in churches I have attended, so I’m sure there was cross-over. I’m also pretty sure that just siting and listening to the verbiage is not enough to make any of it truly stick, much like being saved takes more that listening to a sermon. Staying with either it takes conscious daily effort.
