        Related, but interesting: Real Nazis vs. Hive NazisNazi resurgence: Bizarre clog-wearing Hitler cult on rise in rural Germany“The group, calling themselves “nationalist settlers”, are ultra-right Hitler worshippers but they have traded skinhead boots for clogs and traditional materials and work as organic farmers, midwives and craftsmen.Despite appearing bonkers however their rise is being taken very seriously.A human rights watchdog group funded by the German interior ministry produced a study called ‘Nationalist Settlers in Rural Areas’.Researchers concluded they believe wholeheartedly in the whole Nazi racist superman claptrap and are worming their way into local positions of power as councillors, volunteer firemen, teachers and festival organisers.Anne Schmidt, author of the study for the Amadeu Antonio Foundation said: “This is a very scary movement to observe. These extremely nationalist right wing people are settling specifically in little-populated areas, far away from cities to live and raise their children in a backward ideology.”http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/618425/nazi-clog-wearing-Hitler-cult-popular-on-rise-Germany

        Nedd Ludd: any truth to the rumor that Heisenberg was deliberately leading the German program down a blind alley?

        Nobel Prize Winning Einstein Deniers &amp; Aryan Physics:“Many of Heisenberg’s actions appear difficult to comprehend with the advantage of hindsight…Cassidy puts them in perspective with what Heisenberg had to suffer at the hands of not only the regime, but also the German clique (led by Nobel Laureates Stark &amp; Lenard) who promoted “Aryan Physics”. Specifically, they tried to eliminate all references to Einstein and relativity, and, just for good measure, quantum mechanics as well. Heisenberg’s work was inextricably tied into both concepts, and he was vigorously attacked. Cleared in 1937 by the personnel intervention of Heinrich Himmler (whose mother knew Heisenberg’s), Heisenberg was greatly relieved, and came to have confidence in his judgment about the regime. He was terribly mistaken.”Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.ContentsEntire review:Review by: G. H. Landeron September 20, 2010Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the BombDavid C. CassidyBellevue Literary Press, NY, 2009David Cassidy has written what surely must be the definitive work on Werner Heisenberg. He clearly likes the subject, as this is his second book on the same person! The previous one: “Uncertainty: The life and science of Werner Heisenberg” appeared in 1991. The present book draws on more material, has a wider scope, and at least on the subject of the German nuclear-weapon program draws conclusions that would appear to this reviewer as beyond contention.After a brilliant career, the Nobel Prize in physics at the age of 31 (in 1932), Heisenberg was faced with the onset of the Nazi regime. His love of his country and culture meant that he refused to leave Germany. He never joined the Nazi party, but was faced with living, and working, with the regime. Cassidy finds this the most fascinating aspect of Heisenberg, and it is difficult to disagree.Many of Heisenberg’s actions appear difficult to comprehend with the advantage of hindsight; for example, the famous visit to Niels Bohr in 1941 (the subject of Michael Frayn’s wonderful play) is covered in length. We also (since 2002) have the advantage of the Bohr archives to set the record straight on this visit. Cassidy puts them in perspective with what Heisenberg had to suffer at the hands of not only the regime, but also the German clique (led by Nobel Laureates Stark &amp; Lenard) who promoted “Aryan Physics”. Specifically, they tried to eliminate all references to Einstein and relativity, and, just for good measure, quantum mechanics as well. Heisenberg’s work was inextricably tied into both concepts, and he was vigorously attacked. Cleared in 1937 by the personnel intervention of Heinrich Himmler (whose mother knew Heisenberg’s), Heisenberg was greatly relieved, and came to have confidence in his judgment about the regime. He was terribly mistaken.With the discovery of fission at the end of 1938, Heisenberg, like most other physicists, became involved. He went on to head the main German effort to develop a nuclear threat. As explained by Cassidy, this was not successful due to competing efforts sponsored by different parts of the regime, as well as a lack of leadership and clear scientific, and technical, drive. Conditions in war-time Germany, especially after the start of Allied bombing, were, of course, much more difficult than in the US, but there were no great moral discussions. The notion (the infamous “lesart”) that the Germans did not develop the bomb because they did not want to is nonsense. Cassidy destroys this myth, as others have before, especially the Farm Hall tapes (edited by Bernstein and published in 1996). The German program was blighted by mistakes, both in physics and technology, and they never even got a reactor operating, which Fermi did for the Allies in Chicago in 1942.After the war Heisenberg used his considerable prestige to help rebuild both Germany and physics. In this, he deserves praise. Physics, as expected, had moved on, and he never made any lasting contribution after the war, but his legacy in physics is assured.Heisenberg was a brilliant physicist, and a man who knew right from wrong. Of all the senior German physicists who stayed in Germany during this dreadful time, only Max von Laue seems to have steered a path through the rocks – he chose not to collaborate at all with the regime. Heisenberg’s great error was to believe that he could somehow steer between the moral conflicts of the Nazi regime. He was to learn, to his cost, that if one sups with the devil, take a long spoon. Heisenberg’s was not nearly long enough. David Cassidy has captured this conflict in a brilliant book and I do not expect him to produce a third biography.http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Uncertainty-Heisenberg-Quantum-Physics/product-reviews/B00JBELAZU/ref=cm_cr_if?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;tag=audiblecom0f-20#R2XHAZAVNWSKE0

        Here is aplain text versionof the mentioned “Fascist Ecology: The “Green wing” of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents” in case you want to quote from it.
* an antecedent is a preceding event, condition or cause
And part two is:“Ecology and the Modernization of Fascism in the German Ultra-right“

        Manohman, ZM, you DO have a way with words! I was headed off to vacuum and instead of just “glancing” here, as I often do, or seemingly lurking as I open you up and move on to whatever momentary distraction demands my immediate attention, I sat down and read the entire posting.  “It’s a pretty short trip…” Yep. BNtNG. Perfect!  And ties in nicely with your recent post on what most definitely should be required reading for every man, woman and child; as well, the video of Ben Shapiro and Piers Morgan should be required viewing. Back to today’s post… It was musical to read! And exactly what I needed to ignite some energy to go vacuum on a rainy cold dreary Monday morning.  BT
