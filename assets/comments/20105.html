        Speaking of magic box, the computer software used to predict the coronavirus spread is based on undocumented code written in C 13 years ago.  It has never been peer reviewed and the guy refuses to open source it.https://twitter.com/neil_ferguson/status/1241835454707699713Had a conversation with a nurse who was praising Gretchen for shutting down Michigan.  She is one of the nurses on a team to estimate how many people the hospital she works in should expect from the virus. I asked where the evidence was for the 70% infected rate cited, and she linked me a f&amp;^*(ing NowThis video and chided me for refusing to believe the CDC.Stupidity is far more unpredictable than cool calculation, and the current level of stupidity shown is so unpredictable that thinking even a month down the road is a fool‚Äôs game.  The best strategy is to ruthlessly exploit weaknesses wherever you find them at the moment for your own team‚Äôs benefit.

            I know someone who works in the medical field.  They said the doctors at their facility have gone nuts.  One, who passed out at work because he came into work with a high fever and the normal flu, now doesn‚Äôt want to come into work.  The others are in various states of panic.  This is the point where in an old film the level headed male lead would slap someone while telling them to get a grip.

                    Lol at the dividend income/pensioned beneficiaries of the (((multiracial, global))) economy wargaming the coronavirus on this website! Isn‚Äôt the ability to obtain insured medical care and self-isolate via telecommuting or out in the countryside grand? Must be due to all that high intelligence, hard work, and decisive leadership ability!  Amirite?At the end of the day our rulers and their truckling dependents (including the faux ‚Äúdissidents‚Äù found on this website) regard ordinary Americans as buffers to keep the lights on and absorb the blow. That is the reality. Everything else is propaganda that rationalizes political failure and serves indolence, cowardice, and greed.Can‚Äôt help but note the number of upvotes Z receives with every written fart. What an obsequious lot!

                If I passed out at work from the flu  I wouldn‚Äôt come in either, I could kill my patients.
Also its just possible that the panic is justified. Maybe Corona Chan  is nasty enough to inflict lingering lung  damage n a fair measure of infected people or deadlier than we think. There is talk of both.
Deadly or not assuming medical  people are other first responders are obliged to work no matter what in a society like ours is risible. We show them so little care (c.f 9-11) logic dictates its every man or women for themselves.

                    Nice to see the Z Man climbing down from his high horse and conceding his own wishful thinking. Some genies are out of the bottle and won‚Äôt go back in. The current response, though, is not a panic. It is calculated. There was some panic buying, but the governments, presidents, and governors who are in the room where decisions are made with me there are doing as I tell them. Whereas Z Man is entirely excluded at this time.  Z Man is straw manning here with the notion that people like me in favor of serious measures (not extreme ones) say damn the consequences and ‚Äúthe economy is not important and that will fix itself.‚Äù That‚Äôs really cheap and false. We can chew gum and walk at the same time: deal with a health crisis and an economic one.

            Highly institutionalized nations like ours won‚Äôt change as rapidly as we‚Äôd like.  But the more crises and the more rapidly they come  their increased  frequency will steadily chip away at those foundations.  Clown World is in a perpetual state of war with reality. The further down the Wonderland rabbit hole we go the more goofy we become.  Look at that Dem emergency response bill. They are running out of runway their long-game is kaput.  It‚Äôs not just something to put on the table in opposition to Orange Man.  If in power they would absolutely go for it.  Our thing would grow faster than the heroin the Fed is feeding the markets.  Volatility will always work in our favor even if the FBI goes full Stasi.The Chinese are now seen by nonZogged nations are having handled this crisis better and they are turning to China for supplies and leadership.  There is growing evidence that it was US service personnel engaged in an international military exercise near Wuhan that may have introduced the virus to China.  The Europeans are beginning to push back against the Fagin ratcheting up of draconian measures towards Iran in a time of crisis. There are a lot of things in the works that have become magnified by the virus and the reaction to it.  Throwing it all into the lap of the American ruling elite will be great fun for our side. ‚ÄúWe have to do something‚Äù should yield a lot of dividends‚Ä¶.Vice President Abrams‚Ä¶we should be so lucky.

                Forgive me for being Captain Obvious here, but YV‚Äôs comment (not to pick on you) observation about the Chinese brings to mind an interesting pattern I‚Äôve noticed about this panic, first in articles on mainstream news sites and then comments in various forums, about how the ‚Äòcompentent‚Äô Chinese (and the Russians, too!) are taking up the slack for things like manufacturing medical equipment and sending personell in planeloads to other nations because the Americans ‚Äòcan‚Äôt handle it‚Äô.  It has the same flavor as how the Chinese as of late are paying to be portrayed in the Hollywood movies they‚Äôve been financially backing.The pattern of articles seems carefully distrubuted to elicit comments such as this ‚Äì an attitude coming sideways at you in a familiar forum from a familiar commenter (again, not picking on you YV).  In some cases on various message boards ‚Äì even here in Z‚Äôs comment section ‚Äì I‚Äôve read some comments that just seem very out of place ‚Äì not robotic but odd enough to trip my Authenticiy Alarm.It is interesting to observe in real time the propaganda distribution channels at work.

                    Agree 100%. The ccp has alot more media and politicians in their pocket than we realize.
They also ramped up their propaganda now that the USA has a somewhat nationalist pres. All other presidents were chicom puppets.
That said, the west is also insane and incompetent. Ultimately all they have to do is wait and eventually we will collapse.

                                UFO-society has forgotten by way of being completely indoctrinated with the idea that all people are individual blank, equal slates. From that perverted viewpoint, it‚Äôs irrelevant how many Chinese people come here because once they step on the magic dirt they have no more ties to China than anyone-else. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time talking to normies and reading their comments on political issues and they just do not get race realism, tribalism, race differences at all. Even normies who show signs of hope by disliking muslims (which is common around my area), don‚Äôt really get it at all besides seeing that one group as a problem. That tweet Trump sent out about not having anything against the Chinese or other Asians and protecting them around the world, and only having a problem with their commie govt. was met with the usual Pavlovian response. I commented that the Chinese Govt. is made up of Chinese people! Most just don‚Äôt see the connection‚Ä¶One thing I believe though is that virtually everyone on the right side of the political spectrum-as well as some others, would follow a nationalist platform if that‚Äôs what they were told to do. It would come mostly natural to them imo. If this theory is true, it would make the republi-frauds the most evil of all because it is they who have the ear of that group of people that is salvageable but they keep them firmly on the reservation. The Leftists are what they are, and everyone on the right (and some others) already hate them. It‚Äôs really the republi-frauds that are blocking any real conservativism or nationalism‚Ä¶

                    I‚Äôm not saying the Chinese are competent but how nonZogged nations are beginning to see them.  A good many countries would like to not have to depend on the US.  If China is working the propaganda well enough to start peeling away dependence on the US it will accelerate our problems. Unz.com has a lot  on this subject.  A lot seems farfetched but international sentiment is moving in that direction. If the origins of this does turn out to be US troops then that drift will only accelerate.This is something that‚Äôs been going on for a decade or more largely because of all the arm twisting we do in every corner of the globe on behalf of the Fagins.https://www.unz.com/article/last-man-standing/

        Pattern recognition time.
Look at this!https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/
Almost exactly one-half of the registered coronavirus cases are in NY.  I suspect mostly NYC.  It makes sense, actually.  NYC is full of crowded restaurants and bars where people eat and drink almost on top of each other.  Also, the subway system is a filthy breading crowd for all sorts of evil things.
Could this at partially explain the extent of the current hysteria with much of news media centered in NYC?

                    And yet he is dismissing upstate.  New York City, like Washington DC, is a nearly recession-proof city.  Upstate is very far from so, especially when our economy has been knee-capped for decades by a combination of globalism and Albany capriciousness (think of the fracking ban).  I‚Äôm already seeing/hearing of small businesses and manufacturers that are screwed.  Jobs lost, business down for the surviving businesses, fear and desperation.  And yet, Andy thinks every square inch of New York State has to respond to this the same way, and to sell this he‚Äôs daily spouting utter rubbish on TV.  Very few people have covered themselves in glory this month, but Cuomo‚Äôs been bottom of the barrel.  If Trump decides to promote a return to normalcy, you can bet Cuomo will dig his heels in all the harder.  He doesn‚Äôt give a toss about upstaters, never did.  He knows nothing of us.

            There are some studies that suggest that Chinese and Jews have some kinda molecule (or lack of one) that doesn‚Äôt bind to Vitamin C, so they are more susceptible to the Chinese Flu. On top of that, Italians are handsy, overly social, and great disease vectors (just ask my deceased English grandmother). Guess which American megapolis has these three ethnic groups in abundance? So by those theories, I‚Äôm not surprised NY got it bad. Also, if the American media were all headquartered in, say, Oklahoma City, would the hysteria be there? I don‚Äôt know, but probably.

                Definitely Asian and Jews are 2 groups greatly, if not mostly, affected.Hassidic Jews in NYS have enormous rate of infection. Israeli cases grow up exponentially and presently Mossad directs the operations of ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù, including but not limited to shutting down all public transportation and employing terrorist tracking  technologies.Italy is another curios case: besides being one of the oldest populations in Europe they had an enormous influx of Jewish genes 2000 years ago when Emperor Titus brought 2mils of Judean slaves to Rome. Most of them assimilated into surrounding population no doubt.And then there is an amazing phenomenon of only 2 Muslim countries being significantly affected: Iran and Indonesia, whose population‚Äôs genetics are definitely different from Arab and African muslims.Curiouser and curiouser.

            It certainly explains the rapidity of it‚Äôs spread there. Also explains why the people who run things are especially fearful. As you said, most of them live there. Frankly I don‚Äôt know how they could possibly prefer it. I would feel like a sardine in a tin. Perhaps the psychological effects of living like this is the cause of some of their madness.

        One thing we‚Äôve definitely learned from all of this.When you lose a presidential election and somebody you don‚Äôt like wins, the best, most effective, most patriotic course of action is‚Ä¶‚Äî deny he is the president at all, declare the election phony, negate the people‚Äôs will, and accuse the winner of treason;‚Äî announce your intention to impeach the victor and nullify the vote before he even takes office;‚Äî publicly negate, contradict and defy every single word the new president says;‚Äî destabilize the new administration by relentless legal harrassment, violent threats and arrests of all the president‚Äôs associates, so that quality staff will be afraid to work with him;‚Äî organize your press puppets to speak in one voice on all matters, thus making all issues binary and impervious to discussion;‚Äî make up ridiculous conspiracy theories and use them to constantly harass and investigate the president at every turn, so the administration can never think straight or function properly;‚Äî when a giant real crisis DOES finally loom on the horizon, that is the right moment to impeach the president over the silliest nonsense you can dig up!A man who is beaten down, shouted down, deprived of the best available advisors, mocked and contradicted every waking moment and then subjected to a Theater of the Absurd impeachment is the perfect guy to act with clarity, effectiveness and foresight when the real crisis comes to town.

Just ask the gun grabbing politicos in Virginia.There‚Äôs no magic inside that box. It‚Äôs just people agreeing on what they want, and coming up with ways to achieve it. We no longer agree on any of that and now we have to start parting the road between us. This panic will probably do that nicely if things keep going the way they are. Any road we take will have pot holes, bridges out, and dangers. But‚Ä¶ we all know where the one we‚Äôre on will go.Best of luck to ya, folks.

                In the short cycle, civil unrest accelerates the need to invite and quarter federal troops and exta-constitutional laws to keep order and more importantly the ‚Äúsocial-distancing‚Äù needed to prevent the china syndrome.
Luckily, as Meme notes, their psyop advance has primed the sheeple to self-police so the actual heavy lifting has been done already. The rest is procedural.
Cue Dennis Prager, et al. ‚ÄúReal patriots stay inside their homes!‚Äù
If they come for our guns, otoh, the long cycle is underway and then God help us all.

        Disorder in the existing system is a necessary condition for change but not sufficient.  Without dissatisfaction, there is no social change.There‚Äôs a lot of stray social voltage in the air right now but it‚Äôs undirected.  We don‚Äôt yet have the organization and infrastructure to make anything but local, ad hoc use of this energy.  Our first major disruption event has happened well before we‚Äôre ready.On the white-pill side, this means we‚Äôre probably right in assuming that system shock is going to be a regular feature of late-stage Clown World as its ambitions exceed its abilities.Bad Gaia is not going to beat the Bad Guests for us.  We‚Äôre just starting to build the networks and infrastructure it‚Äôs going to take to win in the future.  It‚Äôs a grassroots level brick-by-brick project right now.I‚Äôm optimistic on a longer timeline ‚Äì that hasn‚Äôt changed.  We‚Äôre in the pre-history phase of post-liberal democracy-America, building the critical mass of dissidents it will take to make widespread positive gains possible down the road.  Our revolution is still at the angry guys talking in bars stage ‚Äì we haven‚Äôt had our Tea Party, much less Lexington &amp; Concord.That said, our critiques and predictions are proving more accurate and useful than Big Other‚Äôs so far.  A lot of our guys were already prepped and it‚Äôs nice to see some mannerbunds stepping up and functioning as we‚Äôd hoped in crisis.

This. It is hard to see how the federal bureaucracy hasn‚Äôt been so discredited by this panic and debacle that Big Other doesn‚Äôt try to co-opt some elements, such as bringing back domestic production of pharmaceuticals. This will be a fig leaf.
But your larger point is spot on. We are still gestating.

            Given our small numbers and limited capacity for organization (if for no other reason, because Facebook and Google will track us down and bust us up), a coexistence model looks like what we are headed for.  This is the Brazil/Argentina model.  There are three major groups in their cultures, as far as I can tell.  The dirt people who live mostly away from the big cities; the poor and violent, who live in the big city favelas; and the cloud/cloud wannabes, who live across the system and the landscape, but work the others for sustenance and protection.  Everyone has his role to play, and the greater system lurches along, as the poor get some level of gibs, the clouds get to try to engineer the society through government involvement in everything, and the dirts find their own way, working the edges of the system and staying mostly out of the way of all the rest.  Meanwhile, over time, the currency gets devalued, the average level of well being, however one wants to measure it, slides slowly and inexorably lower, and ambitious people, not content to work the system for their modest piece of the action, pack up and emigrate.We are travelling down a similar path now, but we are just not as far along.  Recall that, a century ago, Argentina and Brazil were numbered among the most wealthy countries of all. They did not disappate through revolution and a clearing of the ground for something new, as some here expect our culture to do.  Instead the competing factions called a sort of a truce, and learned to work around the edges of each other, in a sort of pact to avoid mutual assured destruction.  We are still in the mental state of all sides against all, with the idea that either the dirts, the clouds, or the poor recipients of the gibs will prevail over the others.C-virus, crashing markets, mental exhaustion and PTSD on everyone‚Äôs part, suggest instead that the three sides will make eventual, grudging peace with each other.  Everyone will get some of what they want.  We get our own communities, largely free of totalitarian local oversight, in exchange for allowing the clouds to exercise all of their Capitol City schemes on mostly other people, and the poor will get bunches of gibs from money printing, which everyone will pay for in a perpetually falling currency.  But from our end of things, land, a home, a community, a full larder, healthy families, survival skills, and mutual community protection will be the parts of things that work for us.  In exchange, we leave the others alone to do their thing.  Not a permanently stable set of circumstances, but probably the best we will get.  The alternative is all-against-all, a variation of the WW1/WW2 state of affairs.  And we don‚Äôt come out of that one very well.  Are China or Russia going to give us a Marshall Plan and the space to recover?  Hell, no.

                Dutch, in this generation‚Äôs timeline, that‚Äôs pretty much how I see it.We‚Äôll have to maintain a sort of binocular focus to see the future with proper ‚Äúdepth perception‚Äù ‚Äì what we can practically accomplish on one hand vs. our ideal society.When I refer to apartheid White America, it‚Äôs generations down the road after we first accomplish something similar to what you describe.A lot of our current infighting now comes from conflicting visions of a future that will never be realized unless practical steps are first taken.There‚Äôs no reason why Groypers. Nazis etc‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt form a caravan of dissent until their respective paths start to actually diverge.  The majority of necessary practical steps are common to all of us for a long stretch of road yet.

                    The petty divisions probably matter a lot less than you think. If and when a strong horse emerges, they will all flock to it. I don‚Äôt think change would necessarily take generations either. History has been moving at a greatly accelerated pace these days. If their side can go from normalizing gays to normalizing trannys in a span of less than a decade, imagine how fast we could go if things tilt our way. Chaos levels are increasing with unrivaled rapidity.

                Why do the elites want to create this?Life was better for both elites and dirt people in the old America. Yet they are still importing millions of non whites and destroying the nation‚Äôs social fabric.It‚Äôs also not clear that we wouldn‚Äôt be better off in a poorer place like Argentina, left alone on the plains or the mountains. The Feds intrude into every place in the USA.We are going to see the brain drain patterns change, though. From rural to large cities, to rural to smaller, more local cities. Frankly there‚Äôs no benefit to moving to NYC anymore for a young white guy. Female driven jobs, hordes of non-whites, impossible to save. I definitely see the appeal of a big city but that life has just about been wiped out by mass immigration.

                    I think you‚Äôre actually ascribing more predictive capabilities to the elite than they had (and have).  This whole shitshow started generations ago with each step being profitable to at least some of them at the time.  Weakening national borders means cheaper labor and even some of the socially revolutionary craziness makes sense if you think in terms of markets.  The old business elite was pro-natalist while the new one is feminist, pro-gay, and anti-natalist.  That‚Äôs because they‚Äôve seen the business case for women as independent consumer and worker units instead of as the creators of new consumers and workers through raising families.Each step in the creation of Pozamerica made sense in the light of the prior ones. That‚Äôs all that was necessary to drive the whole progressivism train forward.  I don‚Äôt think that our elite really had a grand plan.  It‚Äôs just that at some point they decided to take our society down a ‚Äúcatabolic‚Äù path, shoveling social capital into their economic furnaces to be turned into larger profits for themselves.  Now there certainly are certain (((elements))) who do seem to have been following a playbook, specifically the ones written by Alinsky and his fellow travelers.  They certainly have benefited from the chaos, maintaining cohesiveness as the society around them collapsed.  It‚Äôs a chicken and egg problem though.  At this point the treasonous schemes of the WASP elite and (((eskimos))) pretty much always dovetail nicely.

                        The Great Replacement was top down.The WASP natalists were largely toppled in the revolution of 1913; this is why fobs and knobs like Empire Teddy, Puppet Wilson, HSBC Taft, and ‚Äòthe Butcher of Haiti‚Äô, FDR, were cultivated.Coolidge struck back with the immigration reforms of 1924, which bought our culture time.Note that the banksters struck back-back in 1929-1930, first with the crash of the Euro wheat markets and the English pound in January ‚Äô29, the shock wave of which hit ‚Äòour‚Äô overleveraged speculators in Black September.There was a dead cat bounce buying the dip in ‚Äô30, but the base of agriculture, commodity,  and equipment lenders and producers were already wrecked.A repeat of the restrictive Immigration Act might do the trick, of bringing the termites and rats out into the light.

                Have they though? I mean if you are referring to global warming that‚Äôs not really an imminent apocalypse like this thing is, more of an abstract chronologically indefinite religious narrative about our sins against gaia and another reason why we first world white people are bad and why we should live more like the sainted natives. They are certainly hyping things up, but I think that‚Äôs just a short sighted attack against trump. They never seem to contemplate the long term effects of their actions. I don‚Äôt think this will work out in their favor. To people who benefit from the status quo, creating chaos is rarely beneficial.

            Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like the race argument: We‚Äôre unable to precisely define boundaries; therefore, race doesn‚Äôt exist or small racial differences don‚Äôt matter.Yet race exists and racial differences matter.We‚Äôre unable to precisely define the boundary betwixt the mountain over yonder or the valley below; therefore, the mountain doesn‚Äôt exist and elevation differences don‚Äôt matter.Yet mountains exist and elevation differences matter.There are many other examples.Math is a template for decoding reality, nothing more. Has it been correctly applied?Sometimes yes, other times no.We know a few important things about Ms. Corona.I no longer care about debating  these with willfully blinded ideologues, led by the likes of Chump and Rush Blimpbaugh, who ridicule legitimate concerns because they intend to use my loved ones as buffers to protect their interests.Let me be clear: If you‚Äôre not with me, then you‚Äôre against me. And vice versa, of course.If that means anarchy, then so be it. If anarchy destroys us all, then so be it. Unlike the ‚Äúdissidents‚Äù on the fake Right , I am absolutely willing to face that possibility.  Call it my juju.I am done here. Have at it.

                        If it is any consolation, in northern NJ the weather today is beautiful and area (except for the shutdown of restaurants) looks superficially normal.  We see people actually working.  It gives some hope that things might at least partially rebound.  Sanity will need to return from the ground up.
As a relatively moderate ‚Äúnormie‚Äù, I must thank Z Man for providing a platform for views and insights on this current hysteria not found anywhere else.  It gives a feeling of not being totally alone.
Either we are crazy or they are crazy.

                    The effects were so profound that I stopped taking them a decade ago. Fellow trekkers have since told me their experience with malaria was no worse than the flu. I haven‚Äôt contracted it yet or at least appear asymptomatic.A form of chloroquine for Asia was the least bizarre, and the first anti-malarial I was prescribed, although I took it more frequently than weekly this was spread over about six weeks. Lariam turned me into an original gangster. Malarone for Africa, from what of it I can remember, was the one that converted me into The Shining character.The primary aspect of these meds was inability to sleep at all for days on end. Not a wink. The absence of sleep certainly contributed, but I began experiencing other negative effects as I was ramping up taking the meds before leaving home, so it wasn‚Äôt just the sleep aspect. The travel clinic switched meds and varied dosages but I‚Äôm done with them altogether.

                        Dog, that really depends of the flavor of malaria. There are four species that routinely infect humans, with P. falciparum being the absolute worst. Other forms are usually milder, although some can lay dormant in the liver and re-infect.
Still, no human body is in better shape after an infection than before it.

            Its disgusting and demoralizing. But I don‚Äôt know if anyone outside the dissident wire even notice or care. In the crescendo of panic, a return to the status quo is intoxicating.As long as people feel that they are gonna get a slice, the black box Is working just fine thanks.I don‚Äôt see how they come through this without ending up with 75% of the dem platform in place.College loans are gonna go away. All those laid off waitresses with masters degrees?Feels like a compromise for the ages.

        It is impossible to know what the resolutions will be, and that assumes there are some. Magic Box, indeed. Nonetheless, we can all say the following have taken a huge hit:1. China2. Globalism3. Living in dense urban areas4. The federal government in generalI may not like how this winds down, and suspect totalitarianism will win the day, but those things bode very ill for those I hate. It will be interesting and so unpredictable it tempers both my hopes and my fears.We don‚Äôt know. Tough to admit and it is why people consult the Magic Box.

        Observations of late.Flying back to California to work I recognized a pattern I‚Äôd only seen before in elevators.If I say X people are in an elevator, and none of them is with another, you can diagram for me where they will be standing, how they will be spaced. They will automatically adjust their positions whenever someone is added or subtracted.They maximize space out of courtesy in this instance.Watching the (few) people in line at security at the airport, and in the fast-food ordering/pickup areas, and in seating areas, they all showed this same sort of positioning, shifting effortlessly like a flock of birds in flight with arrivals and departures.In this case, they are doing so out of some combination of courtesy and fear. I pray the balance will stay to the courtesy side.In terms of the patients I‚Äôm seeing, it‚Äôs still the worried well and those lamentable psychic frailties already suffering from whatever the upgraded version of PTSD that inevitably comes out of this is going to be called. A future growth industry. You read it here first.I feel the need to talk about tests and evaluating the results thereof. This is the kind of stuff they used to teach in college. I think it got elbowed out by Auto-ethnographic Feeling Studies.What does it mean when they tally ‚Äúconfirmed cases‚Äù? It means the number of positive tests. There‚Äôs no other way to confirm it as there are no definitive physical findings, even on autopsy.In order to have any confidence at all in any test you have to know the rate at which it is false-positive and at which it is false-negative.A screening test, one meant to be applied to those without symptoms, should be very sensitive ‚Äì not missing any real cases ‚Äì which comes at the unavoidable price of increasing the rate of false positives.With every other test that has serious implications what happens next with a positive result is that a more specific confirmatory test is run, one that is more rigorous, often a ‚Äòhigher‚Äô technology test-wise, more expensive and generally less widely available.After this the doctor considers the results: what are the odds that this positive test actually represents the presence of disease? At this point Bayes Theorem comes into play. It‚Äôs like a mathematical lens to focus the data better, weighing the evidence for you as it were. All we need to know about it here is that it critically depends on the pre-test probability in the population being tested of whatever it is you are looking for.All of this is to be able rationally to judge whether a positive test, any positive test, is significant in the first instance.  Results, especially in critical cases, demand to be viewed with a critical eye.Here‚Äôs the deal with Covid-19 testing. It makes a shambles of all I‚Äôve just outlined, fulfills none of the criteria.There are variety of vendors for the tests, thank God and capitalism, and their methods are not all the same. None can tell us anything about their rates of false-positives and -negatives. How could they? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve been running control groups.,Our screening tests therefor are of uncertain provenance.But that‚Äôs okay: if someone comes up positive we go to the more specific confirmatory test, right?Nope, this is it. Judge, jury, executioner.Well, then at least we can use logic, apply Bayes Theorem to the results, salvage some utility from this thing.No, we don‚Äôt know the likelihood of a positive test in the normal host population because the prevalence has never been measured.The conscientious scientists and companies are producing these as screening tests. They are exquisitely sensitive so as not to miss a thing, but again at the mandatory cost of producing more false positives.Here‚Äôs my point: the disease counts are necessarily being elevated by overly-sensitive testing methodologies.Otherwise, if these are all real the way the numbers are growing it‚Äôs gonna get grim. Ten-thousand new US cases yesterday (March 23). It was 500 on March 15 when I started following that particular stat.Free stock tip to close the show: from where we are now, it‚Äôs hard to see anything but upside for Chinese mail-order brides and Asian massage parlors.

        One magic box thinking you continuously see is ‚ÄúWe need to product X, now!!!  It needs to be just like we did in WWII‚Äù
The funny thing is they have no inkling of how X is made.  They fail to realize the disaster that global trade has been for our industries.  You know where we can‚Äôt even make aspirin now.  But hey, we can just magically conjure up production.

        Boeing 737-Max had the magic box whose sole job was to make the plane fly like previous models despite major airframe changes.  We still don‚Äôt know if / when the 737-max will be approved to fly again.

            K (Whatever);Boeing 737 Max is an outstanding illustration of how H1B Tech Globalization = Business Death, sooner or later.  Boeing outsourced the control software to Bangalore to save a few bucks.  Anybody who has ever had contact with Subcontinent students knows that brazen cheating is their entitled norm, both there and here.  Competence tests unfairly strand in the way of Pajit (and his loudmouth sister) assuming the rightful places due them on account of being born into their cast, after all.  But this mind set would never carry over into hard-to-check, black-box type code, right_?Boeing‚Äôs big, possibly insoluble, problem is that, having been exposed for fatal corner cutting on essential control software, to get re-certified, they‚Äôd have to find and fix all the other corners that all the Pajits also cut.  (And without admitting to any of it because tort lawyers.)  Being a brazen cheater, Pajit-1 cannot admit to this and Pajit-2 actually isn‚Äôt competent to find them all but will say he did.  Everybody knows both Pajits are lying but can‚Äôt say so and start over sans Pajits because rayysiss (not to mention costly).737 Max may never fly and Boeing itself may crash, despite OrangeMan‚Äôs  presser pleading.

        Good points all.  The real black swan for me is the current Fed exercise of blowing up the currency they‚Äôre in charge of by buying all the garbage financial assets in the entire economy.  There‚Äôs not one, but two magic boxes.This probably would have happened no matter what though the virus-panic sped up the process.  It was a bit of luck (*ahem*) that the virus-panic coincided with their financial panic so that people who get their news from half-informed coworkers will be none the wiser, though I‚Äôm not sure how much it will matter when they wake up and find themselves in Don ‚ÄúPeron‚Äù Trump‚Äôs vision for Argentinian America.

            Not necessarily. Donald Trump is a man of the marketplace ‚Äúas it exists‚Äù (especially in NYC). He‚Äôs not a socialist, and his instincts aren‚Äôt that bad (read: tax cuts, anti-globalism, secure borders, right-wing judges and justices, America First, wiping out regulations, resisting new wars, etc.). Nor is he a denizen of the Deep State; the multiple media/political hoaxes show they‚Äôve been desperate to get rid of him. So now the panic is showcasing Trump as a leader and (along with help from the feckless Democrats) may be ensuring his reelection. Can the Empire be saved? No, nor should it be, we all agree. But with 4 more years of Trump it may be possible to bring something out of the mess that‚Äôs not catastrophically awful. As Zman says, we just don‚Äôt know at this point. (And I do apologize for my incongruously hopeful thoughts, lol.)

                Trump is a man who zigs and zags, who appears to change his opinion based on new information.  We are so fortunate for that.  Way too many people in politics are set in their ways, and no evidence will move them from their positions and beliefs.  Not only that, but it is all about the ‚Äúskim‚Äù they can generate for themselves, and crisis is simply something to be used to increase the skim, the rest of us be damned.  Things could be a lot worse.

I call that adapting to and dealing with reality as it stands.
That is how effective leadership is supposed to function.
I totally agree that we have a lot of ideologically rigid deadwood in our politics. Just look at the stupid surprises in the Dem stimulus bill that are the same old ‚Äúwoke‚Äù giveaways and set asides.

        My observation is if it spins back up and 401k balances rise again? Not many lessons are going to be learned and the tech giants just grabbed more power. The Kennedy Center gets its gay art financed and tranny week celebrations continue.Us boomers still live and watch our 401k balance daily.It will take the great collapse to change anything and we may or may not be close to that?The Federal Reserve has just been spinning along fine since 1913.The music is gonna stopBut whether that is now or 10 or 20 years from now who knows?

        As a project manager I‚Äôve done more process mapping sessions with teams than I can remember.  Only one of those maps ever had a ‚Äúmagic box‚Äù.  I was asked to lead a one-day event for a bunch of people from Marketing.  They had some new electronic targeting product they bought and were sure it really was magic.  So we ended up with a ridiculous map of crap flowing into the box and ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù sales leads flying out the other end.  Since I would have nothing to do with implementation of this nonsense, I didn‚Äôt care.  Never would have allowed it on one of my projects.

                You are both correct. That‚Äôs because ( i think ) Zman misremembered the magic box joke. It‚Äôs a way of poking fun at wishful thinking.
A black box is inserted into a technical process by the knowledgable engineer as a response to a manager who is asking for an impossible result.
Clearly the inputs shown can‚Äôt add up to the result desired. The engineer displays the diagram and then points to the box in the middle and tells the manager ‚ÄúAnd here, a miracle occurs‚Äù.
Because (duh!) a miracle would be required to get what the manager wants.

        Radical change is unlikely to spring forth (https://theamericansun.com/2020/03/23/a-premature-celebration/) . The system is more resilient than many realize. Underlying it all are self-propagating systems.
Yourself and others are keen to say we are dooming the economy.
Yet the argument never seems to be brought up that following economic bounceback will be large.
This is in fact the historical pattern. West German, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam.
All were crushed and economies destroyed and bounced back.

            I agree with that ‚Äì if the fallout from this affair doesn‚Äôt involve long-term legal changes to the economy.  But‚Ä¶ West Germany, Japan, and South Korea were pretty unpleasant places to live in the late 40‚Äôs into the 50‚Äôs.  Not what I want for myself or my kid.

            The other day, I suggested the rulers would begin bombing cities if the virus did not yield to social distancing. Your examples are all places reduced to rubble by American air power. Not just their cities, but their cultures were turned to dust as well. Not exactly the models most people favor. Further, it took decades to recover. Into the late 1970‚Äôs Korea was a poor country. The economic miracle started after the reforms of the early 1980‚Äôs. Thirty years of poverty is not a great example to sell people. Germany did not recover until the 1970‚Äôs.There‚Äôs also the fact that none of this happened in isolation. Rich Uncle Sam made it possible for Germany, Japan and Korea to build first world economies after being smashed to bits. Who is the rich uncle now?

                Glad you made the destruction analogy because we don‚Äôt have that problem now.There are no rubble or ruins we need to rebuild.Instead we have QE and unlimited QE to funnel in. Modern monetary policy has been decided upon since 08.(The GOP are however squandering their chance for election. Make UBI happen and give people money‚Ä¶)What exactly do you think is going to happen when restrictions lift?Suddenly American‚Äôs won‚Äôt want to go get haircuts, nails done, eat out?These are the jobs being most lost during this.When they bail out the airlines do you suddenly think hordes of families will never return to Disney? (And you don‚Äôt think the prices will be low to drive the traffic?)

                    Hey, you brought up the comparison. I just rejected it. A better comparison would be 2008. That was tepid compared to this and we had about a decade of stagnation. The Fed never was able to unwind much of what they did to halt the credit freeze following the mortgage collapse.I‚Äôll caution you that even on the internet, the choice are never the two most extreme positions. Most of life happens in the vast middle. False dichotomies always lead to false conclusions.Speaking of UBI, I‚Äôve explained in the past why that may be the dumbest idea in the history of economics. It‚Äôs why college debt is at 1.5 trillion.

                        Regarding 08 ‚Äòstagnation‚Äô the perpetual growth meme is an interesting one to bring up. Are the main economic problems of‚Äô today‚Äô from the decade of stagnation? Does a massive illegal workforce stem from 08 and the stagnation?I don‚Äôt think so. You yourself have blogged about the corrupt elite taking money and jobs out of the country ‚Äì this was the trend long before 08. 08 was and is a blip.Again I ask do you think that barbers who are furloughed now are not going to go immediately back to work as barbers to cut peoples hair? This is largely a services ‚Äòrecession‚Äô which will reset itself quickly.I stand by the comparison because the very fact we have an absence of the hardship and physical destruction will in fact make the bounce back quicker, by a lot.There are no restaurants that have to be physically rebuilt. The ovens and cook equipment haven‚Äôt been bombed. We don‚Äôt have to rebuild roads for people to commute. etc.

                            To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure what point you are making. Will the economy recover eventually? Sure. I‚Äôve never said otherwise. In thelong run, all sorts of things will happen. You made the comparison to the wrecked economies of Japan, Germany and Korea. I pointed out that between the wrecking and the recovery, there was a) a lot of misery and b) a super power minimizing the misery.
Your assumption that we will recover quickly from this is without basis. You are hoping the magic in the magic box is good magic.

                                I think this has been illustrating to me to realize that people like yourself, ostensibly fellow travelers, are in fact committed to the current order deep down.Without an 08 recession the economy would be stronger. What comes with that? More Wokeness, more anti-white propaganda and actions.The Cathedral was stunted in 08. That was a good thing. If it gets stunted again and we don‚Äôt have the time of decadence for Drag Queen Story Hour anymore ‚Äì I consider that a benefit.Or as you would say; it‚Äôs a tradeoff. I‚Äôll trade a recessed economy for less Woke Capitalism.Ultimately this is likely an age thing ‚Äì and a life of comfort thing I expect.Be well.

Yes, because everyone knows once you put the economy in the magic box, out pops rainbows and puppies!
Ultimately this is likely an age thing ‚Äì and a life of comfort thing I expect.
Sort of. I‚Äôve spent 30 years solving really hard problems for a living. I know my limitations. More important. I know your limitations. I was young once too.

                        UBI is something I tactically support because it helps hollow out the Empire. I‚Äôd like our communities to be economically-based on something less ‚Äúmeta.‚ÄùThe worst part of our present system isn‚Äôt the market aspects.  The elite capture, usury and cross-generational accumulation of debt are worse.This shitshow is exposing major flaws and hypocrisy in the present system and a UBI critique is good for pointing those out, but in itself UBI is not a solution for anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs just another form of cross-generational can-kicking.I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúpay your own way‚Äù lolbert but soaking future generations for more than they are literally worth is not a workable strategy, and that‚Äôs what happens whenever you write IOU‚Äôs on the grandkids.

                            UBI normalizes welfare and will backstop the modern day robber barons who populate our upper 1/10 of 1% elite.  It has no other purpose than to establish a minimum wage for slaves.

                        Its also probably  inevitable as modernity cannot tolerate high levels of unemployment.As I‚Äôve said before, we don‚Äôt need AI to wreck everything. We just need small incremental increases in the quality of software and robots , enough to make wages to low to buy enough to keep the lights on or for a disruption to create seriously unemployment.Hell an increase in ‚Äúworking at home‚Äù will nuke hundreds of restaurants and other businesses that cater to the lunch crowd causing massive spill over effects much as the transition to online media has for music, books and a lot of other jobs.In the end, either we allow the economy to collapse to a much less complex model , more ‚Äúgrow your own food, buy only what you need, only one person works outside the house‚Äù or we prop it up with massive amounts of printed money.And note you can‚Äôt tax this, not enough revenue in the system and seizing all the cash at say Apple is a one time thing and highly counter productive.As for the price inflation, this is of course spot on but the end result is the economy will be managed to some level of stagnation.Too bad our managers are crap but I suppose the upside is that with such low fertility, there really isn‚Äôt a logical model for growth over the long haul anyway,

                            A few years ago, I asked a very wise retired hedge fund manager friend what will people do in a world with massive unemployment.  ‚ÄúA convenient epidemic‚Äù was her reply.  I don‚Äôt think that the epidemic is the coronavirus, but what do we do when technology is so advanced that half of the adult population is permanently redundant?
I think that there will be a return to the land because as long as you can eat and sell or barter your surplus food, you‚Äôll survive.  You may be poor, but you will survive.

                    Hudson is a Communist.
The debt-jubilee is not proposed in good faith.  It is twirled like a magic wand to appeal to loan-burdened liberal arts graduates and the catladies at Naked Capitalism.  The real objective is to remove the gravity that binds the entire system together, thereby destroying it and resetting to Year Zero.
The other, better, way, is to simply begin first intimidating and then liquidating the creditors, and expropriating the property of those who flee to Tel Aviv.

                        Hudson sells ‚Äúpractical Marxistism‚Äù, true, the State is always his ultimate savior.
But!  The aryan Babylonians introduced Jubilee, and used it to great effect.
The neoAssyrian rulers of Egypt used jubilee to break Joseph‚Äôs ruinous taxation of grain and cattle, and drove the Hyksos back into razed Canaan/Old Babylon, where the potentate ‚ÄúK‚Äù built his temple to Ra-Amen, what we call the First Temple of Solomon.
Hyksos priest Set-Moses, ‚ÄòChild of Set‚Äô, fled, leading his tribe of welfare workers through the Sea of Reeds delta, where they witnessed the tidal wave from Thera‚Äôs eruption that shattered the Israeli coastline.

                            I ponder if the Thera eruption (there were several), what Plato called ‚ÄúAtlantis‚Äù in his political fantasy novel, was the main trigger for the Greek Dark Age, the Bronze Age Collapse, of which Homer‚Äôs Illiad and Odyssey are the only records.Solomon came later, even trusting the Habiru lunar calender; he probably refurbished an empty Temple, as have people been rebuilding the ruins of HarMegiddo, which has been twenty cities, piled on top of each other.  The sturdy stones were simple to reuse.I also thought that the 9 tribes of the Sea Peoples might be Habiru Semites, but the Sea Peoples came from the west, whereas the Sons of Heaven came earlier from lost Sumer, the east.

                    Having the US military provide defense not only against foreign foes, but internal ones, is one hell of a subsidy. People forget that we meddled in their politics all along the way. I take a backseat to no man in my criticism of the current economic system. That said, setting the world on fire, hoping for a miracle, is probably not a great idea. Maybe it is inevitable. Could be.

                    I suspect debt forgiveness for student loans of some type is inevitable.  The loans are a bad debt as it is now.  Defaults are building and simply too many to pursue.  Also all these indebted youth are not contributing to our consumerist economy, i.e., the can‚Äôt get out there and buy shit they don‚Äôt need.
And in support of such students, society sold them a bunch a goods under false pretenses‚Äîlike a college degree is your ticket to a good life and then let colleges offer them phoney degrees in worthless disciplines.

                                Of course colleges should be more picky, but no one will accept such.  Minorities would go back to their traditional position of back ground noise, or magic 10%.  And for Whites, half the population won‚Äôt accept that their darlings just are not college material.
Best we can do is to establish national merit testing and have the Fed‚Äôs pay full ride while limiting such to certain numbers of majors.  Everyone else gets squat and pays their own way.

                    Debt jubilee, on the books, is a tool by which lenders do not get too carried away with lending, because the reckoning is built into the system as an agent to limit things, and everyone understands it.A random debt jubilee, in response to overloaded lending books, is simply a destructive reset to the system, that obliterates everything so something new can be built in its place.A properly wielded debt jubilee is something put in place now, to be triggered at a stated and specific date in the far future, so the lenders can shape up their act over time.  But that‚Äôs not how it would be wielded, in this day and age.

                        grey, that will certainly keep the average person away from a lot of debt‚Ä¶which is not a bad thing in the long run.  I get that credit jumpstarts a lifestyle, but how much effort and money is spent by the average household just paying interest?  If you do a jubilee every ten years, for example, debt will be taken out that pays off when the jubilee hits.
Which goes to my point, which is the economy can be structured around future, planned jubilees.  To throw a jubilee out there in response to overdebtedness is simply setting the economy on fire.

                            In the Fertile Crescent jubilees happened about once every generation or two, coinciding with a change of monarch or the like.
It‚Äôs primarily just a means of clearing multi-generational debt to prevent the usurers from hoarding all the capital over time. It‚Äôs too blunt a weapon for needs-based debt relief.
When lending is causing macro problems in your society, the lenders should take a haircut.
The ‚Äútrickle down‚Äù idea that taxpayers will be rewarded for suffering to save the banksters has been disproven by the rapacious buybacks &amp; self-dealing our present generation of elites has indulged in.

                    Hudson did a good job in his book about debt jubilees to differentiate between commercial debt (no jubilee) and private loan debts (occasional jubilees).The former had long term value, the latter could accumulate to the point where individuals and their families could literally never escape debt, which helps no one in the longer term.I have no faith in any US politician to structure a debt jubilee in any form.  They seem to do the opposite:  protect commercial stupidites at all costs; force stupid loans taken by less sophisticated borrowers for dumb crap (like phones, or useless degrees) to drive them further into debt.

                    Brazil or Argentina is likely the mean on this sort of thing, and reversion to the mean is powerful indeed.  The trick is to carve out your own life and community amidst the squalor of the larger thing.  Many Brazilians and Argentinians do just that.

                    A liberated marketplace will just end up an Oligarchy worse than what we have. Our tech overlords will see to that.
The options that might work  Distributism, Nationalist Populism  Socialist Nationalism or some combination thereof.
Alternately we just take care of our own people and let modernity continue its catabolic collapse cycle .

            A lifetime of doom-mongering media has made it really hard to say that everything will be all right. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right. Yet it almost always is. Hole in the Ozone, ice age, AIDS, rising seas, peak oil, Y2K, 9/11, SARS, Ebola, GFC, and now this. Admittedly they‚Äôve gone all in. They want a literal depression, I think. No sports, movies, shopping, church, birthdays, anniversaries, weddings. Good thing about going all in, is all that‚Äôs left to do is show your cards. Well I say read ‚Äòem and weep. America isn‚Äôt going to knuckle under to a bunch of commies.

        We know the status quo, pre-virus, isn‚Äôt reachable; we know that the system rebooted and why.   We know China is responsible.  We know Europe responded like the syphilitic beggars they are.  We know the people of PRC look at their leaders very differently now.  We know globalism is a death trap; and that some industries and products have strategic value.  To me, it looks like the old system just threw a rod and gakked itself.  And everyone saw it happen.There has been pressure for real change (here in the  US) for decades, and this societal disruption might grease the skids so to speak.   So any determined effort by an organized group ‚Äî even a small group ‚Äî could push things a lot farther than would be the norm.   You can see the Dems going for it already, by rejecting the relief money.  Wait until Trump gets on TV and starts hammering nancy and chuck about keeping money pout of literally every American‚Äôs hands ‚Äî and doxxes them live on tv?!.    There will be mobs outside their houses with torches and guillotines.The more the Dems screw around, the more radicalized the voting populace becomes.  Eventually you end up with helicopter justice for all the left wing shit stains.

        I love how India is shutting down entirely for this.  A country where people swim in raw sewage and dead bodies of a ‚Äúholy‚Äù river and the plague still sweeps villages.  Getting Coronavirus doesn‚Äôt even move the needle there.  Of course this is about an Indian economy that was already failing and now the leadership can blame ‚Äúthe virus‚Äù for that.  And in another year start a nuke war with Pakistan as another deflection.  This is a silly silly world.  The kind of era that historically existed just before the outbreak of major wars.

        ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people on this side that are cheering the lock down. They think it will forever discredit the things they don‚Äôt like.‚ÄùTime and time again, people on our side imagine that because to them an observable phenomenon constitutes incontrovertible validation, every one else will be compelled to admit that they were right all along.Forgetting in the process that the same reality can be grist to many mills.The Yellow Vests in the winter of 2018/2019 was a case in point. Our side‚Äôs coverage was an orgasm of wishful thinking and self-delusion: the neoliberal world order in trouble, european nations rediscovering themselves, national consciousness rising, populism coming of age, etc. Meanwhile every other ideological persuasion was busy making it fall neatly into their own worldview.In the present case, while our own are giddy proclaiming Global Supply Chain BTFO‚Äôed and borders good, European Leftists (of the old school) are all over the dearth of medical supplies, claiming it proves that taxes are too low and hospitals are underfunded. Everyone is ready with their own I told you so‚Äôs.Seeing as since the beginning of the quarantine, the air has never been cleaner, the skies have never been clearer and the pigeon problem has virtually disappeared, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see environmentalists making a come back as well.We‚Äôve never really moved past the ‚ÄúDetroit is proof of DR2, enough said‚Äù mentality. And while we cross our arms and simper with self-contentment like Mussolini on his balcony smugly but vainly expecting cries of ‚ÄúHow could we have been so blind?‚Äù, we lose an opportunity to press home our narrative.

            Anon, I like your thinking. Pressing home the narrative is of course essential, but it‚Äôs nice to have a series of events play out which logically supports the narrative.  I agree all the grifters will spin events to support their world view.  Most of my audience I doubt is at the level of even concluding any narrative connecting such events at all.  I‚Äôll provide them my version/vision.  Find a vacuum, fill it.  Easier than changing an already established perception.

                Last night, as I am checking into the Hampton Inn, the female desk clerk tells me that she ‚Äúwould do as she is told‚Äù and that she ‚Äúwill go where she is told to be.‚ÄùThis after I had taken several minutes to engage her with corona chat, asking her whether she had considered the costs of cratering the economy and whether she had any confidence in Dr. Anthony ‚Äúchicken little‚Äù Fauci (she did not know who he is).You are right that it is easier to find a vacuum and fill it than trying to change an already established perception.

        Few outside of our cognitive class and higher functionaries in the clerisy can or will absorb and integrate into their belief system things presented in the straightforward, dry prose formats.  If anything is to come of these many idea-forgers, theoreticians, analysts and presenters of our camp who have cropped up over the past decades on this or other media, then we have to make the terrific jump to terrain now fully owned and occupied by our opponents ‚Äî to the creative arena. We can make no further headway if we are unable to do this.(NOTE: Not claiming this myself as an original thought; I‚Äôve seen this mentioned on this site and others several times in the past by various commenters.But we need to start looking seriously at this issue.)I am myself a member myself of the great unwashed. I was elevated over my professional life into the mid and upper reaches of the caste that toils to support the plans and lifestyles of those who aspire to run our lives, and that also maintains the system protecting the rulers.  In retirement, and my post-60 years, I‚Äôm once again immersed in a younger, working class environment.In the particular group I interact with now, there is great awareness that something is terribly wrong. Most of them are aged from 18 through 26. They are all highly techno-competent, though they are all working class. About 1/3 are fresh from a hitch in the military ‚Äî predominately Marine Corps ‚Äî junior enlisted to E-5 max. They get most info and entertainment through their smart phones ‚Äî streaming ‚ÄúTV‚Äù series, or YouTube news updates etc.  they are a rough, crude, tough and surprisingly thoughtful lot. ALL MALE. They are also deeply historically and culturally illiterate. And they are tremendously cynical about almost everything, and broadly accepting of the fact that bad things are a‚Äôcoming.To move things forward with this sort, we are going to have to carve out space in the area now held for our elites and rulers by the (ideologues and lunatics of the) creative class.‚Äî&gt; more to follow; kid chores call ‚Ä¶.

        This is a little off topic, but I‚Äôm surprised that there‚Äôs been no discussion about what a backstabbing pair of t**ds Mittens Rombleycare and his mini me Mumbai Mike Lee are being right now.

        We now know that the mainstream Media is inimical to civic life. We know that they profit by spreading panic, suspicion, and demographic discord. Most of all, with the arrival of COVID, we have learned of their capacity to inflict profound social harm.Over the past few weeks, the media has brazenly reaffirmed its status as a cancerous institution. And if our economic displacement proves sufficiently dire in proportion to the severity of the virus, that they are the ones who should be held accountable.‚ÄúThey‚Äôll just finger point.‚Äù  Right. But when the actual deaths don‚Äôt add up as badly as the bread lines, then we can finger point. To the data. And we should keep pointing with a smile.The media is responsible for rendering millions subservient to Fauci‚Äôs squeaky edicts. For weeks, they waited on the word of the media ‚Äî CNN, MSNBC, FOX, etc. ‚Äî  and adjusted their lives accordingly, with the good faith they were being led by a coalition of erudite scientists and competent Journalists. Well, as we will probably see, that‚Äôs not what happened. Us just getting screwed and them just skating, well, how the hell can that happen?

            But how many times can they do this before a real reaction occurs? It‚Äôs only been about a decade since the last one. And before that one another decade. Their mistakes are piling up fast and this one could bear consequences that outweigh the previous 2 by a substantial margin.

        I really doubt that they will be able to fix this by just printing money, but then again it seems to have worked for today. Guess we‚Äôll see. You know who certainly has no way of arising by the same vector. Civic life is dead in America, replaced by a curated, censored and artificially manipulated digitized public space. The reason Spencer is allowed to remain in this space is that the man is a joke and therefore serves as a convenient foil for them. No, this situation is entirely novel, no nation has ever existed quite like this one. The scale of it, the heterogeneous nature of it‚Äôs population, the extent to which technological and sociological ‚Äúprogress‚Äù has altered it‚Äôs social dynamics. There is no road map. Any plans made have little applicability if they are based off lessons learned from the 30s. The continued and rapdily accelerating erosion of public trust in a system led by a clearly clueless leadership class will however continue to open doors to dissident ideas and movements.

        What ties us together as a country?  It‚Äôs not really ethnicities.  We‚Äôre now a buffet of ethnicities.  It‚Äôs not culture.  The elites think they‚Äôre strengthening the country by doing this.  They think it‚Äôs a magic box full of social capital.  They‚Äôre looking for this WW2 era moment when everyone supported the leaders and gladly took their ration cards, etc.  What they don‚Äôt understand, is that thanks to a half century of their policies the only thing tying us together is the dollar, or what will be left of it after we have unlimited ‚Äúeasing‚Äù and many rounds of stimulus (You think this‚Äôll be the only one?)  The first fight will be between states that went full retard (shut down) vs the ones that at least kept the doors opened.  The full retard states will naturally be the hardest hit and want a bigger cut of the loot.  The other states will say ‚ÄúHey Cuomo, no one put a gun to your head on this.‚Äù  Bickering will ensue as the lid blows off the deficit.  But no one will really have to pay for this until we see it in the inflation figures (Act III).  We‚Äôll wait another year for that.  The only vote I have is to shift more money out of dollar denominated assets while the dollar is riding high in a panic driven scramble.

        We‚Äôre seeing a real path for a return to quasi-normalcy by sometime in the fall.  I‚Äôm skeptical about a vaccine, even for next year, but I find credible an estimate that we should have an antigen test by May-June (this would be like a pregnancy test, i.e. specialized, cheap, and fast, unlike the versatile and expensive PCR).  Widespread testing would allow relaxing a lot of the social distancing rules.  We‚Äôre also seeing the private sector react well.  Musk supposedly already delivered his promised 1000 ventilators to LA (hopefully he built them, rather than bought them).  Wars are periods of extraordinary innovation (think of synthetic rubber, airplanes, and nuclear power as examples), so it‚Äôs not magical thinking to expect something similar now.  There are a thousand ways we can still screw this up, but a path to quasi-normalcy is starting to take shape.  And then we can deal with China, the swamp, and various other problems this crisis has exposed.  Because there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre going back to the status quo ante.

        Real/good engineering does not actually work as a magic boxYou have input parameters, you have calculations, you have testing and and you have the final assessment based on these + sound engineering judgmentIf you lock the whole world for a significant amount of time you know what is going to happen even if that particular case never happened beforeGoing back to engineering analogy that would be like designing a beam for 250 kips of load and loading it with 1000 kips and saying let us see what is going to happenWe know what is going to happen, it is going to collapseAs for sudden waking up of  people to the globalist domination and the new revolution in the minds of people, based on every single indication that I saw that is a pipe dreamWhat I see is a collective looting be it stores  or government funds ( which is your moneyand money of your children) Should this prolong and an inevitable depression come the looting will take a form of literal braking into your homes by diversity of all kinds and some desperate people as wellIt is already  and will be much more each man for himself therefore hoping for some kind of collective awakening and solidarity is an illusion born in the heads of the people who sees themselves as leaders of this new revolutionThey motives are for the most part selfish as as they have always been (minus a few exceptions)When times like this come you should fear most those that have nothing lose.Breakdown of the society is nothing but an unexpected opportunity for them

There was absolutely no need to bring up RamZ or Z at all ‚Äì it added nothing to his point.  No need to speculate on their motives.
Gratuitous call-outs and needless counter-signalling are just as harmful as deliberate subversion.

Bars, restaurants , train stations all plastered with huge flat screen TVs.The good news with the ongoing bogus pandemic lots of people out walking getting fresh air . Mostly old people, but still . . . . . Would be great to see their little economic reset come back and bite them in the ass !

        &gt;It‚Äôs possible that some of those things Greg Johnson lists will come true. It‚Äôs also possible that none of them will happen.  People are remarkably resilient to reality, as we see with the panic. If your first response to the prospects of a pandemic are to fill your basement with toilet paper, you are unlikely to draw the best lessons from this panic and its results. The ruling class, the people who triggered this panic, are also unlikely to abandon all the things that allow them to be in power.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-The argument is, if things have been going against white America for the past century, with no end in sight, then  major disruption opens the possibly for change. It is no guarantee obviously. But we know that if things keep going they way they have, things will not change. It is like a mulligan after getting a bad hand. The problem with this argument and white nationalism in general  is it assumes white america is some homogeneous entity united by a shared interest. Successful whites who have family and businesses may not want to see everything torn down.

        What we are doing is setting maniacs with machetes on the magic box.  We are throwing sand onto the gears of a very complicated machine nobody understands just to see what will happen. But we have been doing it for years and years. No matter how many idiot lights are glowing red or alarms shrieking, people look at the engine, see that it hasn‚Äôt stopped and just assume the lights and alarms are faulty.I am guilty of seeing the magic box and assuming unimaginable evil will come out.

        There was this blogger I like, calls himself Z-man I think, who posted about people messing with big, complicated systems. It is almost impossible to tell what might happen if you just blindly screw with the system. Even small adjustments can have huge effects on the system. Could break it even. You might not be able to put it back right if you are not careful.This is what we have done to the US economy as well as the world economy. There will be no ‚Äúfast return to normalcy‚Äù. You heard it right here Z-man my friend. We are really screwed.Now don/‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not predicting the end of life on planet earth. I am not Paul Ehrlich. I am predicting the Greatest Depression in history. This coming depression will make the ‚Äô30s look like boom times. I don‚Äôt see how people in the cities (and I am in one) are going to survive.On the other hand, just maybe God will lead us on a great revival and good will come from the suffering ahead. That I can not possibly predict.I pray for the young that they may survive the coming times.

        Nice piece of writing!  Question:  how much faith do I/we have that those who have the power to define the magic box posess motives that serve the public good?  What record exists historically of results that would confirm they have historically acted in the interests of the public good?  If they are not doing so now,  what checks and balances operate, (if any), to help ensure a positive outcome for that public good?

                Exactly this. I‚Äôve been meaning to write a comment detailing why China is going to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever and the US is going to exposed as a paper tiger, but work deadlines have prevented it. The globalist talking heads who are screeching that this virus puts an end to the Chinese Century have it precisely backwards.China can survive quite nicely without the US. This crisis has exposed the fact that the US is utterly and completely dependent on the manufacturing capacity that we so stupidly off-shored to China over the past 30 years. We lack the capacity to make simple items such as masks and surgical gowns, much less more complex technology like respirators and chemical precursors for pharmaceuticals.The real take-away point from this crisis for China is that it is now free to operate as a global force on its own terms. The US is no longer in a position to interfere with China in any significant way.

                    If there is no money for their goods?  Pharma and others might be the exception because of inelasticity of demand, but other stuff seems doubtful.  If we suffer a recession, so does China.  We are their biggest trading partner. And of course there is hope that we wise up and restrict/limit trade in strategic items, which obviously includes Pharma.

Howard Bloom, a shieking lefty (came up with ‚Äúzero-sum‚Äù, smart), said China was buying time til they became an internal domestic market- with all the world eyeing those low renminbi prices.
Plus, the 82nd airborne won‚Äôt be bringing democracy and purple fingers, instead the Chinese will be making the local rulers rich- just as they did with the Clintons in Arkansas.

France just made being out of the house without permission a minor crime; 3,000-Euro fine, 6-months in jail. Better start leaving your cell phone at home if you want to go out to avoid being tracked.

        Its all a magic box. What comes out this magic box will be the inputs to the next magic box. There‚Äôs so little we can imagine. Its possible that we get more totalitarian on the elite output, but its possible we get more awareness in the populist output. And those feed into the next Magic Box.The hope is we can shift things without a lot of strife or too much break in civilization. That‚Äôs the best case scenario and this magic box seems like a well placed one to get that. But it is a best case. Worst case is Argentina. Reality is far more likely to be in between. Question is, how will these outputs be changed in the next magic box?

        Appropos of nothing, but telling in that it illustrates how much the Magic Box is a clutched straw and how all this plays out is uncertain. My local Fox affiliate this morning aired a segment about how Wuhan has bounced back and is up and running. Yet yesterday it emerged there were cases starting to pop up there and in provinces adjoining Hubei. The ayatollahs of Globohomo knows this will bite them in the ass at least to some degree, so their propaganda whores are having to put on a Big Show that would make Chairman Kim blush.  They will concede, and only when push comes to shove, that maybe having all your antibiotics produced in the Magic Middle Kingdom wasn‚Äôt such a grand idea. So Globohomo‚Äôs Magic Box is limited reduction in Chinese production. Maybe it will be, maybe not, but that straw shows quite a bit of stretching.
