        It’s all a junk show now. Shrillary will not be the nominee. Neither will Jeb. The negatives for both keep piling up. Yeah, it makes sense that the Deep State is looking for a Repub this time around, but the whole thing is up in the air at this point. Never count the black swan out. Did anyone predict Obama? It wasn’t possible because he was very obviously a plant.

        I have a tough time putting “Lindsey Graham” and “straight man” in the same sentence.

        “the GOP is an open book because they are essentially the straight man”
How about Lindsey Graham? He said he represents “Mainstream Conservatism”.

        Years ago, when talk of unseating Boehner started rumbling in the comments sections of conservative blogs across the fruited plain, I asserted that Boehner would never be unseated because Pelosi and the Democrats would save his bacon.  I was, of course, laughed at.  Now, I am only surprised that this is being openly discussed.  But perhaps not.  I think the whole point to this is to disillusion conservatives and convince them to stay home in 2016.What needs to be understood is that the Democrat wing of the Caste does not want to win the White House in the next cycle or two. They need a hawk, and the Democrats don’t do hawk anymore; it’s not part of the brand.  Obama is off the reservation on Iran and the Middle East, and the Caste will want a Republican to fix things.  Also, Obamacare is designed to collapse, which needs to happen on the other side’s watch, and entitlements need to be gutted.  Maybe a bit more focus on the economy as well, all things best left to the GOP.That’s where Jeb Bush comes in.  He entered the race declaring war on his base.  That is by design.  Hillary is a hawkish centrist but she’s inept and, more importantly, a loose cannon who can’t be trusted.  The Caste doesn’t want her, any more than they wanted her in ’08.  She’ll run, but so damaged by revelations engineered by her own party that she can’t win.  If all goes according to plan Jeb will be in place to pick up the pieces with his newfangled Compassionate Conservatism, but he can only get out of the primary if dispirited conservatives give up and stay home.Think this is ridiculous?  Where’s Ted Cruz been lately.  Quiet as a door mouse, snug and warm in a nest of Sheldon Adelson’s money.  Mike Lee’s been taken to the Mormon woodshed, and is also out of commission.  Rand Paul is busy in Guate handing out designer contact lenses to future Democrat voters, while sending Facebook updates to Mitch McConnell.  A couple of fire breathers in the House and a drunken Ann Coulter weeping at midnight on Mitt Romney’s lawn are not going to make much of a difference.It’s going to be a hell of an election.

        The third party gambit, while emotionally attractive, would be a lot tougher than taking over the Republican party. The party structure is there, the founding principles are there, it just takes a lot of grinding work. The question is, what is needed to bump 20-30 million or so people off the dime and into full angry hornet mode?
A nuke on Savannah harbor, or Port of L.A.? Forced homosexual indoctrination in elementary school? A massive bank run? Some other kind of economic collapse?

        I think that the only hope that the Tea Partiers have is to go full Cortez, burn their boats, and start a third party.  Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe that the third party gambit only worked once and it had the unfortunate second order effect of kicking off the American Civil War.

            This old story from Sean Trendepoints out that millions of voters dropped from the turnout in 2012. The Haven Monahan community, as Steve Sailer would put it, is staying home more and more each election. In mid-terms, the vibrant don’t vote so the GOP is competing with the Lib-Dems for the responsible, thus making it a wipe out for the GOP. In presidential elections, the trend is reversed. despite it being their turn, the GOP should not be favored in 2016 for this reason.At some point, someone is going to figure out how to tap those boycotting the system.
