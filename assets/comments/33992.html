        A small cadre of truly evil power-players in the West has engineered the slaughter and maiming of millions of white guys in Ukraine over the past 3 years. And now a lot of average Ivans are dead because they allowed themselves to be duped into fighting a war for Western exploitation of their resources. We must not make that same mistake here. The enemy is within. If we must fight, it must therefore be with the correct focus.

            Those evil power-players hate Russians and Ukrainians equally. They wanted to kill two birds with one stone. Ukraine with a depleted population means more non-European immigrants, a Soros wet dream. They’ll destroy Ukraine, but Russia has been the roadrunner and the neocons the coyote, with everything blowing up in their faces. They can’t beat Russia but at least they destroyed Ukraine.

                Those evil “power-players” are hell-bent on recreating ancient Khazaria.
They fully believe it to be their ancient ancestral home.

                    Wiley must’ve had one hell of a line of credit! The proto-Amazon company, Acme, was always sending the latest gizmos and weaponry to a mangy beast out in the desert who apparently had no means of support! Doesn’t seem like a good business model to me.Edit: By the way, It’s obvious Wiley lived in a less litigious age. All the stuff Acme sent him either blew up or sent him over a cliff. If even one of those things happened today, he’d be the world’s richest coyote. He could order his roadrunner from Uber Eats.

            For the life of me, I can’t understand why Putin has been playing paddy cake with the Americans, especially granting the real estate lawyer (Witkoff) a court with him on several occasions.  It makes me question if he’s even a Slav.  As a Slav myself, there is NO WAY I’d be treating the US with such courtesy.  We are a brutish, hot-headed and stubborn people with a long history of suffering at the hands of Western nations…and now they want to get back in bed with them for ‘economic cooperation’?  Why would Putin want to help the US in any way, especially when this rapprochement is only being pursued so the US can focus on Russia’s most important ally, China?  Does Trump really think he can separate Russia and China?  It just doesn’t make any sense unless Putin thinks they can use the four Trump years to gain some breathing room and get their affairs in order for the post-Trump world.  I would prefer Russia act more like China has wrt the tariffs.  China basically laughed at Trump, stood their ground and wouldn’t you know it, the tariffs are pretty much off now.  If anybody can offer a reason why they think Putin/Russia is being so conciliatory to the US, please let me know!

                Putin doesn’t want this all to go nuclear. Simple as. Even whomever was running Bidet knew if the French sent troops to Ukraine officially, before long the frogs would escalate, so got them to back down.

                Putin is a scorned zapadnik at heart and always has been. He built a system which primary purpose was to stabilize Russia after thesmutaperiod of Yeltsin, nothing more, nothing less. His entire presidency in terms of relationship with the West consists of demands to be treated as a peer with recognized sphere of influence in the post-USSR area. He was never the Great Hope as some dissidents in the West are painting him to be. If it wasn’t for the American imperial arrogance and constant desire for asset plunder, the Obama Reset would’ve continued unabated and everyone would have been happy. It was Putin’s endless attempts to obtain the deal, that emboldened the West in trying to strike at the geopolitical weak point of Russia- Ukraine. Before then, Russia never went on a major offensive to regain its standing, restricting herself to firefighting like in 2008 Georgia.Most Eurasian initiatives undertaken by Russia were done half-heartedly and only as a leverage against the West which remains the object of aspiration for the elites since the 90s. In a country where oligarchs send their kids to Europe, where European imports and economic partnerhips has been always desired, politics is dominated by the people who still prefer to play hard-to-get with the West and diversify only when they need to. Fortunately for the Russians, the world is changing and no matter how much the Petersburg class is longing for the western bling, they will need to accommodate the new realities instead of being stuck in the 2007dolce vitanostalgia.Then there’s the uncomfortable truth that Russia is simply weak for her size and resources. Ukraine has been a badly bungled mess where Putin kept dragging his feet unable to secure the country in his sphere of influence, despite how important Ukraine is geopolitically for Russian power. Then came the 2014 humiliation and the war in Donbas which was another firefighting done to obtain the ultimately worthless Minsk Agreements. Objectively the legacy of Putin’s westward diplomacy has been a failure so far: no recognition for Russia’s sphere of influence, no prohibition on further NATO extension into former USSR.Now that this mess of war is going on, the most optimistic perspective is to capture the East-bank Ukraine with Odessa. For a country that aspires to regain a great power status, it’s humiliating, Ukrainian resilience, bravery and western backing notwithstanding. We’re talking about a doorstep country which provides a crtical postion to easily launch attacks deep into Russian western interior. The silver lining is that the military was forced to re-learn how to fight and actually begin transforming into a XXI-st century army.

                There’s also the fact the Russia needs some potential leverage against China as it cannot measure economically with them. This is not about eastern Sibieria or other western-spouted nonsense. It’s about China gaining advantageous position on Russian markets due to a decreased competition. This war has also allowed the Chinese to purchase gas and oil at far better prices, prioritizng the pipelines like WSTO.Regarding the Slav thing. Yes, we’re stubborn and obstinate, but also very slow in adopting new ways and moving on from the old ones. Russians in particular have always had the tendency to develop rapidly and chaotically, only to fall into a period of lethargy afterwards until a new wave of reformism comes. Beyond that Putin is old, I doubt that he is personally able to move on from his cunctatorial/Fabian way of doing things which may be why in the last year we’ve seen some young appointments in the administration. The SMO myth will also provide a justification to involve veterans in the cadres.

                    Thank you sir, very enlightening!  I always knew of Putin’s ties with the West and desire be accepted as a peer/partner and I suspected he’s getting leaned on hard by the oligarchs (The St. Petersburg class, I assume) to begin economic normalization with the US.  I know Russians with Attitude usually talk derisively about boomers in Russia, I imagine this is why.  Putin really is a moderate liberal at heart, the western media just makes he seem much more badass then he actually is.

                        Indeed, Putin is both the creator and the product of systems. He curbed the excesses of the oligarchs, but couldn’t eliminate them as this would require raising a new class in its stead which could spark further unrest and extend thesmutafor an even longer period.Ivan the Terrible did something similar when employing thedvoryannobility against the boyars in Muscovy and Peter the Great tried to raise a new elite with the Table of Ranks.As a compromise a quasi-feudal system exists where various power centers (oligarchs, security services, army, federal administration) vie for power with the President being the arbiter with his own court favorites and power base.I always liked the analogy with Empress Elizabeth I Romanov, the daughter of Peter who curbed the power of Courland German aristocracy in Petersburg court and almost sundered the ascendant Prussia.

                Surprisingly, Zelensky resisted the West’s demand that that the entire breeding-age male population of Ukraine be killed (and its women shipped to brothels).Aspro-war propaganda, mind you, the NYT recently “reported”—relayed the official story—that the Biden admin had threatened to condition aid to Ukraine on a full draft of student-aged men. That would leave Z with no nation to rule after the war, he objected.It suggests he’s been offered no exile. I’d assumed he was fully in on the plan, and London had assured him aninternationalfuture. Apparently not. Maybe that’s why he’s so erratic. No one will let him see the script, so he’s improvising the part of President of Ukraine based on an outsider’s idea of what that means.He doesn’t want to save “his” people, obviously, but thought he’d get tokeepsome.

        “Everyone assumes Trump lacks the resolve to walk away from this situation and leave the Europeans to work it out with the Russians.”Does it need resolve? He hasn’t got ego or reputation invested in this. All he has to do is to say he tried but found the Ukrainians recalcitrant and incorrigible and that he has bigger fish to fry (which incidentally is true). He’s already called it “Biden’s war.” Why does he have to invest further time and effort in Biden’s mess? Let the European faggots flounder and drown in the mess they helped create. And somewhere along the line he might also decide to withdraw from NATO (one can hope).

            Frankly, I think he should have said this as soon as the election was over. Shift from the secret plan for peace to blaming the whole mess on Biden and the Europeans. For some reason Trump wanted to make a deal. That is why the Europeans and the Ukrainians think he is bluffing about cutting off aid. They called his bluff after he booted Zelensky from the White House and he bent the knee, so they are not wrong this assume he will do it again.

                Or it could simply be he recognizes reality for what it is? Ukraine will fall. That’s easy to pin on Bidet, and maybe on the neocons. But if he makes the right noises and talks about a deal, maybe he gets credit for the “inevitable” coming to pass?

                    No, the press will go into manic mode with universal talking points that Ukraine was on the verge of victory, and Trump fumbled at the goal line.  Thus, all the ensuing chaos is his fault.  Half the country will believe it.

                        True. That half wasn’t voting for him anyway, so I’m not sure that makes any difference. And those who did vote for him will discount what MSM says as leftist talking points. The question I’m pondering is whether his base can or will accept it as a “win”. You can’t undo the millions of dead, but maybe just stopping the killing would be a “win”?

                            I agree.  Recently, 60 minutes has run several segments that were so over the top with propaganda they were amusing.

            Oh but he has the ego and reputation invested in it. Just like Nixon inherited the Vietnam, he inherited Ukraine and he is responsible for how USA ends up on the finish line. Why would he keep flip-flopping between calling this the Biden’s war and bragging about how much stuff he gave to Ukraine? No matter how much blame he will pin on the predecessors, the conclusion will be pinned on him as was the Afghanistan on Biden.The Euro leaders can see this and like Macron (who reportedly has good personal relations with Trump and knows how to charm him) are exploiting this weakness by trying to become the local security leaders, potentially with US blessing. This is why there’s probably no threat to NATO or Europe creating a competitive bloc, it’s all part of a bid in the new order and after initial blustering, Trump appears to be playing a weak hand after failing to capitalize on the initial talks with the Russians. As theZman said, his bluff was called and he’s back to square one with this foul egg of a war.

        Trump holds the reins of the most important horse. Is he the one with the will to sit high and gallop to the other side?Doubtful. The past week I have been filled with a heavy, sinking feeling. Many drastic things have been done to destroy Our civilization. It has been surrendered in just a few decades. It isn’t razed to ashes yet, but that is coming. That is what the Managers are biding their time for. They only have to wait and the forces they have unleashed will leave everything in ashes as they flit about in Netjets and live in drone guarded fortresses.A countervailing something drastic is going to have to happen to turn the tide.

            Trump has accomplished more in his first 100 days than I thought possible. Anything good he does from here on is gravy. And there will be some more wins. He has a relatively better team this time and good chunk of the tech sector is behind him.Like the old French elite Zman mentioned, many of the tech bro ruling class pay closer attention, and they know our country is in trouble, but I’m not sure they have the resolve to fix it. Many of them seem bent on flipping back to the old script and (to rift the girlboss post from yesterday) the potential of an AOC or Kamala regime looks increasingly possible as the days go on. We know they can rig our elections. That’s not even a question anymore.Last thing, I just want to hat-tip Zman for the careful approval of JD Vance last year. I know a lot of people on our side don’t like him, and I was overly harsh on him too, but he’s still young and learning just how dirty the other side plays. He has made some good calls and been a steady hand for Trump. Wish POTUS had a few more like him, rather than the Bondi/Patel clowns Trump generally surrounds himself with.

                Agreed, Trump really did not take it slow as the wishcasters were predicting (I think this shows failure of theory of mind of a person you tried to assassinate). Even his more botched initiatives have created a lot of edifying acrimony. The idea of U.S. taking over Gaza was so bonkers that the “normal peace process” industry has been damaged by proximity to it

            Same here. It does not appear that the folks at the top of this administration either have the power, intellect, or will to do what is necessary. The Supreme Court decision was a kick to the solar plexus, in that we already know that Trump is by his own particular political nature unlikely to understand what must be done. The younger members of his staff playing around on X with cute memes are deeply unserious people, simply by virtue of that very activity. I wonder if there are more than a handful of people with the historical and political knowledge to have an accurate sense of where we are, and what the traditional solutions are to these “crises,” with any kind of power at all in the federal government. The remainder of those in DC will, as you say, bide their time.I expect that we are about to enter another week or two of idiots like Linda McMahon going after universities to work up the WWE/MMA crowd that is most vocally pro-Trump. Trump knows from Nixon that kicking the bums around on campus is always good PR. If you were to give Trump a button that would permanently end all Ivy League schools in the US, however, he wouldn’t push it. It’s just noise for nitwits.

            So this is counterpoint to Zman’s hypothesis?“The modern managerial elite is populated by mediocrities skilled only in the sort of scheming that is the basis of drama. They also possess a stunning lack of self-awareness. The people thinking they just need to wait out Trump also think they are loved and adored by the masses.”does not map well into an hypothesis that they areubermenschen,that the mess we find ourselves in is some willful design.

                It isn’t an either or. The true believers and flunkies are legion. However, there are cold, calculating and highly competent operators too.Mayorkas is one of them. The people who orchestrated the growth of BLM and the Summer of Floyd are among them. To assume this is all incompetence is to underestimate what we are up against. This is a willful project of creative destruction executed by very powerful people who don’t care how eggs are broken. In fact, every broken egg is an opportunity to seize more ground.The mass dispersal of tens of millions of invaders throughout our entire country is not an act of incompetence. It is the careful execution of a long standing plan by highly competent and sinister people. The goofs flying to El Salvador to and preaching to save an MS-13 gangster only help matters because engaging with them burns up time and energy chasing after the rodeo clown. Meanwhile Mayorkas and others continue with planning and execution.They may turn out to work hand in hand.

                    I’m not saying this is the product of incompetence and neither is @Zman. Solid midwits are more than sufficient. It does not take a Dr. Evil to figure out how to dilute voter pools with illegals. It’s nothing more than knowing which precincts are run by their loyalists, who will do what is required to make sure the vote comes out right.
Meanwhile, those same red areas become impoverished through diversion of local moneys to alien relief, market distortions of the local economy because of all the FedBux, and, eventually, increased property taxes.

            Same feeling. Z comparing Trump to Gorbachev strikes me as wishful thinking. It’s true that both men emerged in the convulsions of dying empires, with a similar ambition: to save the system. However, what worries me is that Trump isn’t our Gorbachev, but our Khruschev. The latter’s de-Stalinization and “thaw” proved a false dawn; the system bore down and replaced him with Brezhnev, who, while not the sadistic bastard Stalin was, rolled back K’s mild reforms and made the KGB great again. My point being, the “system” still has teeth, the ranks of the enemy haven’t been thinned, and all its institutional advantages are still in place.

        With regards to time, I was under the impression that I would be long gone before things got kinetic with regards to an improvement of the political situation in the U.S.
Recent events are dissuading me from that notion, (The Tesla vandal not facing charges), the DOJ taking their sweet time to arrest obvious criminals in the government.
I know that there are many on this site that think that the damn won’t break, but my thoughts are otherwise.
I pray for my kids and grandkids.

            The establishment-approved terrorists of “the sixties” (mostly the ’70s) were similarly lightly prosecuted. Check out the disposition of cases against the Weather Underground, for example.
Our guys have taken to citing the Church Committee as a lost model of government transparency or a blow against the past “deep state,” a purification ritual we need to remember and repeat. Its actual effect and probable purpose was to undermine the prosecution of terrorist groups infiltrated/run by intelligence—but not “right-wing” ones, of course. No cops in there!
Anyway, don’t despair. Too late was a long time ago.

You gotta know when it’s time for new material. His schtick has gotten old.I love helicopter Trump the most. I just loved the impromptu press conferences he gave on the White House lawn on the way to the helicopter. We need to see that Trump at least 50% of the time.I like the mean tweets Trump, too. The tweet against the Supreme Court last weekend was a good reminder how satisfying it is when he calls people out and mocks them for the mediocrities they are.

                How is an act of vandalism in Minnesota a federal crime? Do we really want the AG to “come up with some federal charges” (i.e., “Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime”)? Dissidents and even orthodox conservatives are reckoned to be against federal over-reach.
What would Merrick Garland do? Well,that’swhat he would do. We shouldn’t be modeling ourselves on him.
I say this reluctantly, because I know the villain will probably get a light dusting in Minnesota. But the principle of federalism is more important than punishing an agent of mild property damage.

        “If they cannot shape reality to their liking now, then they just need to wait until reality comes to its senses”Alas, that is very true. Today’s column is a good companion piece to yesterday’s on girl bosses. Women and feminized men are especially prone to not letting an ugly fact get in the way of a beautiful idea (Huxley).I spent years consulting to executives (both male and female) in Eastern Asia who had to deal with executives in either the US or EU. The Asians, including the women, were mystified that every time they would try and explain that a corporate process or program would either not work or would be illegal in their country, they were told “that is a can’t do attitude. We need people with can do attitudes!”The Asians were also confused as to why everyone in America or the EU had to act like they were super duper excited about the current thing. Getting super duper excited just doesn’t seem to come to Asians as easily as Westerner Whites.Both the need to never say something won’t work (you are saying no) and the need to be super duper excited are both characteristics of corporate culture that white women have dramatically taken to the limit.Regarding the Ukraine debacle, what we saw with the Biden administration and the current EU is this same feminized behavior as found in corporations. I get the impression that the Trump administration (like the Eastern Asian) people don’t quite know how to deal with it because it isn’t natural to them.

Yes exactly.  A brittle, semi-hysterical culture of white women, who think they are powerful and awesome, but are totally propped up and failure-proofed.
Cannot, must not, ever tell them no.  About anything.  Corporations, schools, colleges, media, government, entertainment, even the churches — all ruled by white female culture.

                Yes, you can’t tell white women no in a female dominated culture.
I worked for a little while in one and even the man who was the Chief Compliance Officer had to champion projects he knew would put the company out of compliance. If he didn’t, women would team up to destroy him with the 365 degree feedback – it was mandatory to do well on it. Men learned that you said yes, waited for the stupid project to fail and then, when they asked you what to do, you could be honest. But only then.

        History is the integral of all these daily “news cycles” that Management types try to manage. The problem is that you can optimize the news cycle while have abject failure as a long-run result. Since we’ve seen no consequences from failure – Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan and now Ukraine – we’re going to keep getting more failure. There’s no feedback loop: everyone associated with these recent debacles gets promoted, or a Board seat with Lockheed or an NGO gig. We can only conclude that we are headed for a Cannae-scale disaster that will force a reckoning for the Managerial class.

            You’ll know a full reckoning is underway when the firing squads get started. The criminals who planned and carried out the actions that resulted in regime change in Kiev back in 2014 need to be stood against a wall.

                Yeah, the Trump Admin is toothless without consequences and a reckoning.  Prosecutions, jailings, seizure of assets, exile. Doesn’t have to be that many, just the right ones.
I haven’t forgotten J6, lawfare, 3 a.m. perpwalks of political enemies, and ever so much more.  Whose side are you on, Donald?  Ours or theirs?
I do not think Blondie Bondi has what it takes, and Donald has shown no inclination towards restoration of order either.  What’s lacking is some good old-fashioned Old Testament justice.

                    ray:I haven’t forgotten J6, lawfare, 3 a.m. perpwalks of political enemies, and ever so much more. Whose side are you on, Donald? Ours or theirs?Last night, the internet got rather excited, because RFKjr walked across a street in Georgetown, carrying a “Saratoga” bottle in his hand:https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1914498206811001270It was a great photo op, but it’s now the next day, and I’m still sitting here, wondering why Albert Bourla &amp; Robert Langer &amp; Bill Gates &amp; Anthony Fauci &amp; Klaus Rothschild Schwab &amp; Rochelle Walensky haven’t yet been frog-marched off to Guantanamo, for their respective firing squads, to remove each &amp; every one of them from this mortal coil.At this point, the V@xxpocalypse is all that matters.And my instincts are informing me that RFKjr likely cut a deal with the Council of the Sanhedrin, after several billion dollars were placed in a Swiss bank account for RFKjr’s retirement fund.tl;dr == I’m very very very worried that RFKjr went full Leprechaun on us.

                    I don’t have much regard for Bondi, but she is just carrying out Trump’s directives.  If he wanted arrests, there would be arrests.  It’s a long shot to hope they must first replace a lot of prosecutors, and are biding their time.  A real long shot.

                        Yep, she’s his employee.  And emblematic of the failure so far to punish evil done during prior administrations.  And of Donald’s weakness for blondies.
When the Left is in power, me and mine get threatened and called Public Enemy #1.  When the Right gets in . . . nobody backs me up.  Suddenly it’s Can’t We All Get Along?
I wanted a fire-breathing, patriotic, pissed-off AG who is looking for Beltway traitors and criminals. A man, a badass. Not a well-coiffed AG looking for her nail remover and the next photo op.

                    I think you are probably right. What we tend to call “cuckservatives” and the like is them just following their “principles”.  Frog marches are not in the cards because they believe that the judiciary should be used against those who violate clearly defined laws. Being a political opponent is not enough.
Indeed, the name itself identifies an ideology — a normative vision of what should be.  The realist should have long ago realized “that’s not who they are”. Regardless of what they should be to fit our model of the world.

                Even without a revolution.  They will never stop doing what they are doing without consequences.  Why are all the neocons not sitting in prison or waiting tables in a diner?  Without the consequences which should naturally occur after such horrendous failures, they will continue to do it.  It also sends a message to those with bright ideas that if your obviously dumb idea doesn’t work as you claim it will, there will be consequences.

                “Both the wogs it imports and the deplorables they replace worship the money it prints.”Ha, you ain’t kidding.  Even get readers here who can’t understand that their stock market gains are only thru theft.  If you lower interest rates to 0% to reflate the stock market, you are stealing.  The only people in real life anyone would ever lend to at 0% is family.  Funny, did rates on credit cards go to 0% during that time period?  Of course not, but banks were able to rebuild their balance sheets leading to friends low and banking that small amount of interest on large amounts.

                    Those types are far less common here than you supopose, @Mr House. Most people still have not grokked the connection between interest rates and stocks, particularly when even those who understand that much have no explanation for why the bond market has stubbornly refused to do what it should have done.
The types you are going to have much more problems with are those who want their student loans to remain low (or forgiven) or who want low home mortgage rates.

                    You have it backwards, as usual. People with assets would much rather have high interest rates. If I could just walk into the bank and get a guaranteed 7% interest on savings, damn straight I’d take that. It’s the decades of low rates that have forced people into the stock market if they want any assets at all to show for their time on the planet.

Of course, bernake state that was the plan with 0% rates.  Not much different then attempting to force people to take their experimental injection.  Still theft, and if rates go to 7% or higher, your assets are going to be worth a lot less.  Only worth what people will bid on them.  Assets and interest rates are like a seesaw.

How is the taxpayer at all affected by stock valuations? Plot out tax rates v. stock market performance, just once, rather than going on with your stupid talking points.
Brainwashed people piss me off, if you couldn’t tell. Particularly when they are obviously smart enough to see through it. Morons I tend to cut a lot of slack.

His online banking statements were not showing, it was an internal issue and the IT team was looking into it, which i explained to him.  He was rude.  So i went out of my way just playing around to figure out how to get his statements.  Took me about an hour but i figured it out.  While trying to explain to him how he could get his statements (which he felt was too much work for him) he blurted out he pays more in taxes then i make in year.  You remind me of that.  You want your cake and to eat it too.

                                “You are a dolt If I were offered a button to reduce government spending 95% across the board”And you think stocks would stay where they are?  If stocks can stand on their own two feet, why bailouts, why low rates?  They’ve been low since the dot com crash. You must be objective, are you doing that right now? Have you not been paying attention to the heart attack they’re having with tariffs?  Not even cutting government spending.  You’re a stock welfare queen but you can’t admit it.  The first step to recovery is to admit you have a problem 😉

I’m absolutely certain I’ve never in my whole life said anything remotely like that. If anything, I’ve been a doomer about the decoupling of price to earnings.

When the market was still allowed to discover price, so 2008!  They’ll fall, job losses need to happen first.

                            If they’re productive, why do they need bailouts?  If you and i run a company in the same field, and you’ve been buying out competitors and investing big time in chinese production of cheap parts (lets say we’re in auto parts) and i’ve been doing it slow and steady, competing on the value i offer the customer (via better parts and better service) and the debt markets have a problem because they’ve been mismanaged for decades.  Why do you deserve a bailout?  If you are so productive, why do you need a bailout?

All I’m saying is IF we refuse to do anything about the spending, it’s a whole lot better if the inflation manifests in stock prices rather than consumer goods. It would be even better if it only manifested in small private islands and Gulfstream jets and mega-yachts, things that have absolutely no impact on the prices you pay.
If you want to slam that 95% across-the-board spending cut button, I’ll gladly make room. It’s pretty lonely out here.

                        Correct, Steve.  For most people, their largest asset is their house.  Once they lock in a 30 year fixed-rate mortgage, higher interest rates raise income more than their expenses.

                            Yeah, agreed. Which is why I’m having a really tough time understanding what I’m seeing. Particularly after Covid Work From Home. I know lots of people who bought a $20k lot, paid for a $10k slab, and tipped up a $30k house. They are living on 5-10 acres. If most people can telecommute, at least 3 or 4 days a week, why isn’t this much more common?

                            Do you have the faintest clue how corporate taxation and preferential individual income taxation for capital gains over dividends affect these decisions?
You want to reward production? Give preferential treatment to dividends. You want corporate big wigs to make up numbers for things like “Good Will” and distort everything just to make their stock options better? Then keep doing what you are doing.

                                    If a corporation is considering expanding, taxation leaves them few choices that make any sense. If they save for 5 years to buy the equipment, they face 28% taxation on the savings they set aside all 5 years. They will have to save at least an extra couple years to make up for it.
But if they instead borrow, they get the expansion as soon as the equipment shows up and gets installed, without paying the 28%. Plus they get to expense the finance charges.
Do you really have no inkling how that might affect debt financing?

                        Cheap debt and bailouts are like steroids in baseball.  Brady Anderson went from hitting seven a year to 50 something.  Did he earn that?  Barry Bonds went from a scrawny good all around player to a neck the size of two legs.  Did he earn that?  Cheating is cheating.

                    Ordinary people should not be in the stock market in any event.  It is only the inflation that kind of forces people to go into something they not only don’t understand, but literally know nothing about.The stock market existed so wealthy knowledgeable people who understood the risks could own a piece of a productive asset.  The return on capital was based on the profits of the company through dividend payments.  Now, few stocks pay dividends and valuations are based on hocus pocus and good feelings.  I’d be willing to bet that under 2% of ordinary (general public) “investors” in the stock market know anything about how any of their stock’s companies are run or what they even do. To them, these stocks are just an abstraction printed on a piece of paper they get quarterly.

                        I agree 100%, 401ks were invented to hold the populace hostage in my opinion.  If you bailout, then no risk exists.  The losses have to be taken by someone, hence 0% rates for a decade.  The losses were forced on those who didn’t participate.  You would think people here would be against bailouts and corporate welfare, but you can lead a horse to water and all.

                            This is crazy. Check out the “bailouts” from 2008. Paulson made the banks take the checks regardless of whether they wanted them or not. In the real world, those who did not need the money used it instead to buy up their own stocks. Everyone else in the market who could not afford to ride it out took it in the shorts. Particularly those over 73 years old (note: no Boomers) who had Required Minimum Distributions, and would face penalties if they did not sell in the down market. All these loans were paid back. Every one. But Joe the Plumber did not get any of this “bailout” money.The rest of the “bailouts” were even worse for Joe. Even so, most of the corps paid back the bailouts. The ones who didn’t? Mostly the green boondoggles and United Auto Workers. Even GM paid it back after it got out of bankruptcy. The mom&amp;pop bondholders, who, legally, should have been first in line? Obango removed them entirely, and put UAW at front of the line, when legally, they should have been after common stock. Oh, and of course, government bondholders like Canadian pension funds, got their money, though right after UAW.Your “taxpayer” paid jack shit of the bailouts, other than the boondoggles and union sops. You can look it up. Though I expect you won’t.

                                So why the bailouts of even larger size in 2020?  Jesus christ you just won’t quit.  Why the 0% rates again oh wise one?  Why more QE in 2023 when those banks failed?  Because they all paid it back and don’t need more bailouts?  Are you that dense for real?  Or are you just a troll like i suspect?

                                None of them would have been able to pay it back if not for the 2nd bailout, the trillions of Dollars in QE, most of which is still sitting out there.What percentage of the GM bondholders were mom and pop? Let’s not forget the sector wide auto bailout called Cash for Clunkers.  Nothing so stupid since FDR burning food in the depression had ever been done.The taxpayer (and everyone else) paid 100% for the bailouts in the form of inflation.  You would think an ideological libertarian would understand this.  When the government spends money, someone is paying.Finally, even if all the money was paid back, this is like a degenerate gambler using money entrusted to him to place bets.  If the bets overall don’t lose any money, no harm no foul, huh?  FFS, cry me a river about the banks allegedly forced to take these loans.

                                    Sorry, @Tars, that’s simply not true. By the time the inflation “trickled” down, it had already been mostly sequestered in the stock market. You know that flat out because wages did not keep pace. Had that truly “trickled” down per populist economic theories, you would have seen wage hikes. So you are at least implicitly supporting Cantillon Effects, though not the implications.
I do agree with the gambler thing, and I hated on Paulson at the time. I have never once, in my whole life, been in favor of bailouts. So why the strawman, dude?

                        Agreed. It’s crazy that we’ve allowed ourselves to be boxed into this. In my great-granddad’s day, it was easy enough to drop a silver dollar into a mason jar, and trade up into double sawbucks. Deflation made saving for the future easy. In my granddads and dad’s day, they could choose blue-chips paying dividends, which could not be scammed. It’s only in my day and beyond that we have to put up with trying to play the game or retire in squalor.
Why?

                            We didn’t have deflation, we had increased productivity which drove down prices.  Deflation is destructive.  The general price level can fall because of it, but these are different things.  While I am not throwing shade on the man, if your grandfather was an average guy, he shouldn’t have been in the stock market.It’s funny, all the regular people who got caught up in the stock market before 1929 all learned their lesson and never touched the stock market again.  But a couple of generations pass, 10% inflatation is happening and all of the sudden, the children of the great depression are putting money in stocks again.  Now we are at the point of instead of 7 years or so of the stock bubble, we have multiple decades.

                                True deflation is never destructive. Why would anyone in his right mind object to paying less for anything? Worst case, he could always pay the asking price and use what remains to kindle a fire in his back yard fire ring.I do agree granddad wasn’t in the market. After my dad died, I found a ledger that showed granddad named every one of the livestock he acquired.I agree betting in the market should not be required. They should be able to live out their lives on their savings, particularly with the increased value their savings should have accrued,Point is, though, reality is. Give me a reasonable way of getting there, I’m in like Flynn.

        The Ukraine war was pure stupidity. Just examining the sizes of the militaries involved would show that, barring strategic and tactical incompetence, the Russians would ultimately prevail in any conflict.The Russians have to be commended for not retaliating against NATO, who is obviously a combatant at worst and a shadow ally at best.It took me years to break the conditioning about the truthfulness of what we read and watch in the Western “media,” which are nothing more than lazy, biased stenographers who gleefully parrot whatever BS the regime hands them with no scrutiny.Mask up!30 days to stop the spread!The vaccine is safe and effective!The climate is changing, so we need stupid electric vehicles that weigh as much as a tank and go as far on a battery charge as those gas-guzzling beasts of war!Russia is nothing but a gas station with nukes!Fast charging for EVs! (more like 30 minutes for 80%)WMDs in Iraq!The lies just go on and on and there’s never an apology or even an acknowledgement of their role in the menticide of a population.

        I know it would personally affect myself and my family, but part of me wants Trump and the US to stop any support in this conflict so the EU can get a harsh reality check.For far too long the US has been paying the bills, despite a number of military base closures and  troop reductions over the past 40-years or so. And while this has the expected results of financial impacts to the local communities that’s just how things go and people adjusted to the changes or moved on.I’m sick to the teeth of German and EU political elites thinking they can go it alone when in fact they are completely unprepared and have no plans whatsoever. I would love to watch Trump turn his back on the peace talks for good and expose the monumental stupidity of EU political elites to there’s no question in anyone’s mind what utter fools they all are.

        “This is what gives the West the same feel as pre-revolutionary France.”It’s infuriating that Biden can open the floodgates of illegal immigration without any recourse on our part, yet “Muh, due process” when we try to get something done. Likewise with gay marriage which was invented out of thin air. We don’t have people with enough gumption to invent anything that benefits us out of thin air. And they wonder why so many people are absolutely disgusted with the Republicans supposedly on their side.I continue to call them cucks because that’s how little respect I have for them. Lately, I’ve been calling them Uncle Toms. They are the house knee grows siding with the slave masters rather than the people they supposedly represent. Our house knee grows side with Israel, the military industrial complex and oligarchs. They don’t do a damn thing for us. (I say that having just written my premium check for my worthless Obamacare bronze insurance that they were going to repeal and replace 10 years ago.)The only thing they are good at is condescension and wagging their finger at us while scolding us. “Muh, that’s not who we are.”Maybe if a couple of Luigis started going off on them, they would get the message. But then again, a Luigi did go off on Scalise and things remain business as usual.

        The woman you wrote about, the new representative from New Hampshire who is married to Jake Sullivan, is an exemplar of this. She thinks because she taps a screen with her fingers that reality bends to her will at that moment.It’s amusing to me on a dark level, but the fact is, I have to spend my declining years in a country that has been leveled by these fools and will continue to be. The thought of being in one’s 60s or 70s with the US in 1990s Russia-shape keeps me awake at night.Watching the Dan Caldwell interview on Tucker Carlson might be worth a gander. Caldwell goes right back to spring 1992 and starts his history lesson from there. (He was fired from the Pentagon last week.)

        Trump does just need to walk away from Ukraine, sooner rather than later.  Of course the legacy media tards and democrats will denounce him as Putin’s puppet, but what else is new and who gives a F.  Further, he and his administration should cut off the msm from any and ALL interviews or press events.    What’ll Margret Brennan do when she can no longer primp, simp or argue disingenuously with leading Trump officials?

        As Z-man astutely points out, wars, especially long wars, break governments and societies…The Russian revolution was largely successful because the Czar entered WW1, with predictably disastrous results for everyone…his top advisor had predicted such involvement would destroy the Romanovs   but was ignored…The Ukraine war is already threatening the stability of the EU and its feminized leadership, and may well lead to its breakup….and if Trump vacillates, the Ukraine and Israel’s demands for an attack on Iran can seriously damage and even destroy the US as an entity…

Not one-man rule, or rule of aristocracy or plutocracy, but of small groups elevated to positions of absolute power by random pressures and subject to political and economic factors that leave little room for decision.They are representatives of abstract forces who have reached power through surrender of self. The iron-willed dictator is a thing of the past.There will be no more Stalins, no more Hitlers.The rulers of this most insecure of all worlds are rulers by accident.  Inept, frightened pilots at the controls of a vast machine they cannot understand, calling in experts to tell them which buttons to push.”W.S. Burroughs.

        Isn’t stalling a viable solution?  Every year they import more low IQ animals into this country, and every year people breed themselves stupider and stupider.  The basic premise behind “control information control the people” is that people are too stupid to figure out propaganda.

        There is never any pressure to do anything in this world, so there is no need to worry about time. There can always be another meeting to discuss the things discussed at the last meeting.

            Back in my corporate days, I started to log the time I was in meetings versus doing my job. The point was to go to my boss and ask for some relief on the meetings, but then a funny happened. One week it was all meetings. I literally did nothing but sit in meetings, few with anything related to my work, or I spent the time travelling to the meetings. I abandoned the idea of getting relief from meetings.Instead, I stopped showing up. I would attend some that might have value, but the rest I skipped. Eventually my boss asked me about one of them and I played dumb, acting like I did not think I was supposed to attend. I would rely on that for the remainder of my time. I applied this to “action items” that turned up in my inbox too. Most of those were pointless time wasters.

                An employee’s value to a company is inversely related to their love of meetings.  When I was a corporate director, I had the worst of both worlds.  I had to attend all the meetings the VPs loved so much, but then go back and run my department while they all went home early.  There is a definite skillset to sitting in meetings and describing problems and processes very well, but never actually taking responsibility for anything.

        If the Hispanic vote were really as critical to national political success as the myth claims, immigration control would indeed be a political loser (assuming all Hispanics favor immigration, which is by no means entirely true). No serious politician would support reducing immigration or controlling the borders if those positions meant defeat, and that’s precisely what the Open Borders crowd harped on in the past.But if the Hispanic vote is not so important and the white vote is, then the party’s strategy needs to adjust to that reality. It needs to think hard about how to win and keep the white vote — far more than it does now.In 2000, George W. Bush won the white vote—- but only by 54 percent. In 1972 and 1984 Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan won a whopping 67 and 64 percent respectively — support that translated into a national landslide. In the 1990s, weaker candidates like George Bush Sr. and Mr. Dole carried only 40 and 46 percent of whites — which translated into defeat.Sam Francis 2004

        Does Trump “walking away” and suspending US military support lead to a Russian victory? (seems like the central question). The answer doesn’t seem clear. I’ve been hearing for over 3 years now that such a Russian military victory is imminent, but clearly the “west” is capable of waging a successful defensive campaign(whether or not this is dependent on direct US support). Can Europe, sans US support, pool enough resources to more or less hold the line? My guess is yes. Thus they would claim victory and trumpet the dawn of a new era of Euro military cooperation. Assuming Trump doesn’t just cave to globohomo and keep the support going anyway, which I would lay 70/30 odds he does.The empire that never ended chose Sodom on the Potomac as its base of operations because of its military invulnerability, 2 oceans etc, and failure in foreign wars isn’t going to topple it. It appears that only a broad and deep economic failure has a chance to do so, of such a magnitude that destroys its ability to print free money (and/or makes that money worthless). Which is the true wellspring of its power.

            The trouble with the hold the line idea is they have been doing this for three years and the line has steadily moved form right to left on your map. Over the last year the line has moved at an accelerating pace. Wars of attrition, which is what we have in Ukraine, rest on the assumption by both sides that they can outlast the other. By all objective measures, the Russians have time on their side and we see this on the map.

                    Russia historically is very good at playing rope-a-dope. Just like Ali, on the ropes, crouched in a defensive position, letting his opponent wear himself out.

            “I’ve been hearing for over 3 years now that such a Russian military victory is imminent”Who was saying this?  Not the mainstream, i’ve heard all kinds of bullshit the past three years, but not what you’re stating.  You have to give the Ukraine credit, they’ve managed to last a lot longer then realistic people expected.  They wouldn’t have been able to do this without US material and monetary support.  We’ve been essentially paying for their entire war the past three years.  Can Europe step into that gap?  I don’t think so.  Lots of people forget that another thing that occurred right before covid, was lots of talk about another european banking crisis.  Europe is in a much weaker position then the United States.  When woke first went mainstream in 2020, i thought it was the Chinese.  Now i think it was the europeans pulling that shit.  They have nothing resource wise and if the world is going to split into blocks again like the cold war, they need to leech off someone.

                No, it definitely wasn’t the MSM saying it, it was dissident media saying it. And rather loudly in my recollection. Nor has that completely stopped. It appears to be primarily drones that have prevented a rapid Russian advance, and I’m guessing Europe can maintain a supply of them. As long as enough human bodies can be found. I don’t know who is going to pay to keep the Ukrainian regime running if the US doesn’t.

                    I recall dissident media saying Russian victory was inevitable, but only maybe a few saying it was imminent.  Most as I recall saw it as a long grinding methodical slog – in fact, criticizing Russia/Putin for taking that approach.
I also recall MSM taking Russia’s slow approach as a sign of weakness rather than a deliberate strategy.

                        People tend to forget that NATO spent 8 years between 2014-2022 building Ukraine into the largest army in Europe and Russia (despite all the problems early in the war) still managed to destroy that army by summer 2022. After Russia’s retreat from Kherson and Kharkov in fall 2022, Ukraine/NATO built another army that was destroyed in the failed counteroffensive in Zaporizhzhia in summer 2023. Same thing happened in Kursk last year. Point is, if Russia wanted to handle this the way the US or Israel would, they would be an international pariah. It’s a delicate balance and I don’t envy the people who have to make these decisions.

                            Truth.
“After Russia’s retreat from Kherson…” That really should have been on more people’s radar. Russia had range cards filled out on pretty much everything, and executed a more or less textbook shoot-n-scoot, but realized NATO/Ukraine brought along NO counter-battery, so it morphed into a “shoot-n-shoot” with batteries only having to move to keep the Ukes in range.
What a cluster…

                    I don’t think Russia fully understood what would be required of them in the war, just like most in the North and South thought the war would be over in weeks.  They do now and they’re devoted to doing it right it would appear.  The ukraine is like Steve’s precious stock market, he’s earned it, pay no attention to the trillions of bailouts and interest rate tailwinds!  When its gone, reality will assert itself.

                    You are correct, and to be specific it is outlets like: The Duran, Col. MacGregor, Judge Nap, Pepe Escobar, Simplicius and worst of all, Scott Ritter. I stopped listening to them because of the now 3 year record of predicting immanent Russian victory and being wrong every time.There is another dark theory out there put forth by the Russian right wing. That is that Putin is deliberately ruining Russia from within with wars he has no intention of ‘winning’ (i.e. forever wars), and with mass non-Russian immigration (sound familiar?).  He (Putin) shuts down and even jails Russians who voice this view. I don’t know if this Russian right wing view correct or not, but I am starting to consider it a damn depressing possibility.

                    Macgregor is someone you have to parse pretty carefully. Ritter, too. Most people think they said things they did not. In this case, they are confident that Russia could have wrapped things up, and are somewhat surprised that they have not. Not surprise at Russia’s inability to do so, but rather at the restraint.
﻿The US sure as hell didn’t do that in Iraq. MacGregor figured Russia would have at least studied 73 Easting, and they surely did, but they have not emulated it, content with a slower grind that gives the West time to reconsider.
As if, right?

This has been my realization, too. The City of London and Basel constituting the centers of gravity. All roads lead there.
“America is too valuable to allow Americans to make its decisions,” said a British aristocrat to me once. I experienced a bad feeling when he said this during a world event. I think he was acknowledging something he knew as private fact.

        “One possible explanation for this is that a key pillar of the managerial state is the assumption that people respond to information, so if one controls the information, one controls the people. Since another pillar of the managerial state is that reality is made by people, it follows that one can control reality, or at least the perception of reality, by controlling the people through control of the information. The old expression, perception is reality, has become an article of faith among the elites.”
Ah, the exceedingly rare triple tautology. Rarely spotted in the wild.

        To “walk away” effectively, Trump will need to end 5-eyes intelligence sharing, cut off funding, and he’s going to have to put someone in charge of putting the CIA in a box.  Otherwise, they’ll continue covert funding.  Trump will need to criminalize this.  And probably put DOD in charge of delaying, disrupting, and denying CIA access to Ukraine.
It is important to remember that this is Washington’s war.  Trump can’t walk away until he destroys Washington’s ability to fight.

I don’t think this is true. They just think they can herd cats, if they had to. Something like that. They used to call it “Nudge”. Yeah, no, not gonna work. And they have been in a panic ever since they realized ‘nudge’ was generally BS, while trying to pretend they have everything under control.

                I think so but I’m not sure. I remember reading Charles Murray’s book “coming apart” where he mentions belmont vs fishtown. I think even if you control for race, the college educated do better (and are interestingly enough more likely to go to church)

                Suspect its probably still true. If one thinks income has some influence on outcomes, obviously a double income is better.

        The war in Ukraine is testing the American patience. For the longest time the Ukrainians have behaved like the princess in the Donkey Kong video game universe, waiting for their Super Mario (read: Europe) to come along and rescue them. The Europeans have obliged because it suits their egotism and sense of self-grandeur. The Americans are a different kettle of fish. Being mostly a practical people, with America money talks and bullshit walks. Now we are seeing strength in the form of the American fist ✊ come down on the side of a strictly rational, non-dreamy solution to the sorry mess. The Ukrainians, prompted by Europe to dream, are being dragged back down to Earth by the nasty Americans. As Ukraine marches inevitably toward ceding the Donbass territory to Russia, expect bitter looks of recrimination behind the Ukrainian back at the U.S. it was ever thus with losers.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)
