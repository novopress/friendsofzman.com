        Whatever changes the steroid era brought to lineups it is a fact that, by percentage,  more pitchers were roiding than hitters. That’s a wash.The greatest changes in baseball both came in 1969, after Yaz won the batting title barely above .300 and Gibson the ERA title at 1.16. It was decreed that offense was in: the mound was cut from “18 to “12, the strike zone shrunk from the letters down to near the belt. Pitching became enormously more taxing. The first thing you see suddenly is all five man rotations, the workhorse no longer a pitcher doing 300 innings, but 200.  Relief pitching necessarily became a much greater part of the game.Video changed the game for hitters as well. Their swings are much more sophisticated than forty years ago. There is no comparison.As for home plate umpires, the time cannot come soon enough when balls and strikes are called electronically.

        Pitching when the batter isn’t ready is a safety issue.  You’ll never see that.When the batter is intentionally delaying the game, a strike needs to be called.  When the pitcher does it, a ball.  But both of these require the umps to do work, and the umps hate to do work.  So forget about that.You need the umps to call the high strike, but the umps can’t be told what to do.That leaves rule changes.  But while hockey and football will gladly make (major) rule changes to improve the game, baseball stubbornly resists.  “Tradition” and/or union greed prevail every time.  The easiest solution would be to play 7 innings, but forget about that.So, the game will spiral ever-toiletward.  Ratings will be at soccer levels for our grandkids.  Little League participation has cratered in my town, down 50% in the last five years.But some people will make enough money to keep MLB going, so it will keep going.

            Baseball is the most financially healthy of all the sports. They have labor peace that has moved toward genuine cooperation. Their franchises make model and have sustainable business models. No other sport can make that claim.

        Speed up the game?Those folks promising 2.5 hours of “eye time”, on every available surface of the stadia, to advertisers-at an ASTONISHING rate, may have some concerns about that.Especially on the advertising spaces directly behind the Kabuki theater acting “stages”.Also see: Sideline advertising areas behind zones on soccer fields where players are most likely to “dramatically” flop. .

        Now that beards, ‘staches, and bathmat sideburns are back in style in the Bigs, can a repeat of the glory days of the ’70s be far behind?

        Problem is, the damn umpires cannot be forced to call the strike zone as it is in the rule books. You can’t fire them, so they do whatever the hell they want. Which is, call strikes from the ankles to the crotch. Inside and outside vary as the ump likes, too. Guys like Glavin and Maddux were getting called strikes six inches off the damn plate when they were hot.
