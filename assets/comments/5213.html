        I’ve been going to the same 7-11 each day for many years  to get my $1 coffee refill. It’s my real life non-internet continuing education, especially since they began accepting EBT cards. I know the clerks pretty well. They see it all, but they don’t talk about it. It’s like working for the NSA and signing the Official Secrets Act.  You hardly even see an eye roll. They’re stoic, even to the regulars.This morning I put my buck on the counter and my clerk, a long timer, said it. “I hate niggers.” I don’t think he meant it though. He meant to say he loathed them. I heard the event that precipitated this outburst ahead of me, but multiply this dozens of times each day. The clerk isn’t white. None of them are, currently. The last white man to work there was an eighty year old Cuban who refused to show fear to three armed chimps. They beat him to death, or so they thought. Roberto survived, barely. I guess he’s seen worse.Section 8 EBT behavior is unsustainable–because by it’s nature there is no bottom to it. The people who always get up on time, do split shifts, and make ten dollars an hour detest the user class and everything they represent.This is all an explosive mix waiting for a spark. I don’t think it will happen but it would be better if it did.

        Most people, at least in my experience of life in the west, usually show that we can get along reasonably well providing the other people around us more or less fit into the generally accepted framework of society. When I was at school there were, as it happened, no black kids but there were handful of Jewish boys and girls. No one cared much about that because while the Jews didn’t attend the daily assembly (or at least the religious part) they fitted in perfectly well with the rest of us. Their skin tones may have have been marginally darker but they spoke English and acted as if they were English. No one cared that they didn’t worship Jesus; in fact we were pretty envious they didn’t have to sing hymns each morning and instead went in the school dining room to finish their homework. One Jewish lad was a friend of mine and while he irritated me in lessons by constantly drumming on the edge of the desk behind me, it was (largely) a good natured irritation.At this point I could say there was no racism because there was no difference to notice. Gradually I began to see more and more brown and black people in the UK (we are going back nearly 60 years) and slowly became aware of increasing differences. At about this time I began — and this was the shock — to grasp that some of the people who looked different were utterly different. Their looks were immaterial, but the fact they didn’t like the society they lived in and who made it clear they didn’t want to comply with what I thought were reasonable conditions of acceptance into society began to worry me. I had no trouble with people who didn’t like England, but I thought as England was beginning to bend over backwards to try and make them feel welcome — though it was apparent soon enough  that it was never going to be enough — they ought to make an effort. or, failing that, leave for where they would be happier.But at the same time I began to be told by the great and good I had to accept them. I had to act as if they were okay when some of them were manifestly not okay. Forty years ago it was possible to say “I don’t like what I am seeing and hearing” but another twenty years on and there were frowns that you had such a view. Then laws were passed by people I had mistakenly voted for, who said that my thoughts could be punished, and at the same time the lawmakers opened the nation’s boundaries to more and more people who didn’t like the society they arrived in.Men with shaggy beards and dressing as they would be happier in the desert thundered loudly that we British had to change, or else there would be trouble. Meanwhile, more laws were drafted to make sure I never said anything about this or if I dared think an ‘unapproved’ thought I better keep my mouth shut. As for the lad who drummed on the desk behind me, his life went in a different direction to mine and we lost touch. I can’t help wondering if he is still with us whether his Jewish background may yet be a problem for him and his family.But on reflection he was too much like the rest of us, and though he was being English in a time when it wasn’t a penalty, he will no doubt be as aware as me that times they do indeed a-change.

        &gt;One of the great, unspoken truths about life here is that we really all get along pretty darn well.I beg to disagree, just illegal aliens account for nearly 37 percent of federal sentences, that isn’t what i call getting along… Hell, the black on white casualty rate dwarfs even Americas loses in Vietnam, the Viet Cong could only dream of a daily body count that high. Statistically it’s safer for a White person to serve a tour of duty overseas, patrol the streets of Kabul, than it is to walk his dog in Philadelphia. Just going by numbers makes the current black on white race-war Americas deadliest conflict since WW2!

            That’s the great difference between the US and the UK. We have a large population of people with outlandishly high crime rates. That changes the math of diversity. Immigrants to the UK are at the top of their crime problem, but they have nothing like Detroit.

            I’m talking about Los Angeles, CA. Of course there are no-go neighborhoods, gangs, individual assholes, and all the crap that goes along with urban life. My point is that by and large people *here in LA* get along pretty well. I am no kumbaya chanting moonbat. I live here. I know whereof I speak.

                A town with no-go areas counts as ‘getting along pretty darn well’? Sounds more like a state of tension just short of open conflict.

                        Fine, everyone gets along–provided certain people remember to never enter the Forbidden Zone.
Perhaps you’re not so much getting along, as you are accommodating yourself to challenging conditions?
Good luck to you in any case.

                        Rule #1 of internet arguments: Nothing you can say will prove your point to my satisfaction. Now please tell me why you think you are right. You win. It’s a war zone here. Don’t get within a hundred miles of the joint.

                        I spotted a small contradiction between asserting that people got along well with each other, and the existence of no-go areas.
This dead horse sure looks dead to me.

        The corruption of language is part of the trainwreck. Racism has been conflated with bigotry. This destroys any possibility of a frank discussion on the matter in the public square. Racism is the second hand smoke of human evil. Out and out Bigotry is (from my experience in 60 some odd years) really pretty rare. For the record, I live in the Los Angeles area. You can’t live here happily if you try to bean-count all your friends, acquaintances, and co-workers by race. One of the great, unspoken truths about life here is that we really all get along pretty darn well.JWM

        Something either is or isn’t true. The idea that something shouldn’t be true, and won’t be true if we pretend it’s not, doesn’t stand up to logical examination. But the very fact that you would put it up to logical examination, means you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be doing, which is pretending something is true, to make it true.
There’s really no dodge around the concept of racism. If you are not willing something to be true, rather than trying to establish objective reality, then you are evil.
