        Our political class is like the mobsters in Goodfellas with the Bamboo Lounge.
” And, finally, when there’s nothing left, when you can’t borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze, you bust the joint out.”
Right now, our uniparty is getting ready to light the match.

            I’ve been using that movie scene to describe those who run the U.S. for going on a decade now.  This country has or had a great deal more to loot than the Bamboo Lounge.

        There’s no doubt that the sales pitch to Wall Street was that after a successful war, they’d get to rape Ukraine like they raped Russia in the 1990s. And if this went really well and Putin was deposed and replaced with a Yeltsin-like leader, Wall Street would get to rape Russia again.The lunatic neocons really believed that this war was their best chance to bring Russia to its knees and make it a vassal state, maybe even break it up, which would ensure that it could never rise again and make it easier to exploit.They believed this insanity and pitched it to Wall Street. Hard to say what Wall Street really believed but given that there was little risk since the govt would guarantee their investments anyway, they went along with it.

            Speaking of exploitation, big agribusiness companies, hedge funds and oligarchs have purchased a lot of Ukraine’s fertile farmland–Some say as much as 28% of the country’s arable land. (“Some say” means “for what it’s worth”). Google Earth shows the heavily fought-over territory is pretty much all agricultural land, much of which is now full of bomb craters, shrapnel, unexploded ordnance and minefields.
So, some very rich people have incurred some serious losses and are intent on getting compensation and probably hot for revenge. We will probably never learn how this plays out.

            Agreed that it seems like the desired end goal of this war, and why the GAE started it in 2014 and then doubled down on it in 2022, was to try to get Davos/Goldman Sachs-friendly regimes in both Ukraine and Russia.Local and Western Jews ran Russia in 1991-1999, and were of course able to completely economically rape its vast resources during those “happy times”. Local Jews also ran the Soviet Union in 1917-1930, and were able to do what they wanted, including genociding tens of millions and destroying the nation’s Christianity.Those two experiences were enough for Jews feel like the righteous order of things, what they deserve, is to own and syphon wealth from Russia and Ukraine forever. Having returned Russia to the Russians is why the GAE hates Putin so much, and why in the modern West there is open criticism of Stalin as a dictator but not much of Lenin.In general, once Jews own something, they feel like they deserve to own it forever. See, Israelis using ancient history to justify occupying Israel now. See, Jews (and Jewish values) running the Obama admin behind the scenes and preparing to do so with Hillary too, and then seeing the Trump administration as a crime and illegitimate, and then them feeling it legitimate to trash all laws and rules to steal the executive branch back, because having it for eight years had them grow to feel that they deserve to own it forever. And it’s why the 2% in modern America believe that they deserve to continue to rule over the other 98%, and won’t give it up without the fight that we have just started to be seeing.

            The accelerated looting seems to signal a desire to get as much cash as possible and turn it into hard assets. It doesn’t bode well for American citizens and their wallets, but who the hell cares about them? They can and are being replaced with people who have different expectations about what a dollar can buy.

        I spent some years in DC years ago and this is how it really works. The lies are for the rubes to believe. The plan seems to be to get the war beyond the election, then blame it on Biden. If he loses the election, that’s easy. If he wins,  they’re going to substitute someone for him anyway, and move beyond the whole mess as they did after the Afghan withdrawal.

        I don’t even think DC cares about finding someone to blame anymore. Nobody paid any price for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria – I can go on National Review or Bill Kristol’s X account and they say how great all these operations were. The warmonger walrus John Bolton is on MSNBC like he is some sort of foreign policy sage. The same people who engineered those disasters are setting policy as we speak. Nobody in DC has ever suffered for proposing or agitating for more war. They are totally insulated from failure. When the Ukraine operation finally comes to a close, everyone will just pack up and move on to the next war. And this is a dynamic that will continue until it can no longer continue, either due to a totally humiliating defeat (a la the Russo-Japanese War) or full-blown collapse. We have also seemingly entered a new phase where they don’t even pretend or hide that they are doing anything but mindlessly supporting Israel and doing whatever AIPAC and the ADL tell them to do.

        As someone noted, the Palestinians are coming to The West. Fink and Kushner probably already have a lock on the seaside resorts in whatever new Hebrew name it will be given. The disputes over the offshore gas deposits will end and Israel will have a lock on those with Blackrock also probably holding title/rights to it. It goes on and on.Meanwhile, for the GAE this loss is not some minor thing where business will just go on as usual. This accelerates the GAE decline. Europe was told to endure the pipelines being blown up, and take on the economic hardships of the war in order to stay aligned and benefit long term from the greatness of the GAE. I think that ends up shattered as German industry and intellect parachutes out to America. Maybe China woos them.In any case, it could well be that slowly but ever more quickly the next periphery of the GAE crumbles as Europeans disenchanted with trannies, POCs, POC colonization and countless other humiliations start pivoting to vassalage as part of the Eurasian alliance. I pray that Europe is able to pass usury laws and/or negotiate some sort of debt jubilee. This madness of forfeiting their homelands in order to sit in rest homes and die off under the, “care”, of Africans and Middle Easterners who will assume occupancy of what was once the domain of Europeans must end. Massive economic dislocation is preferable to the end of your race and the forfeiture of an entire continent to foreign hordes.As for the GAE, it will saunter on, but losing sway over Europe will be something that emerges. Remember that The Regime has a huge number of tigers by the tail. Our job is to be the strongest of them and play the long game.

            For the GAE and its European vassals, nothing, repeat nothing, is more feared than economic dislocation. The loldollars are priority one, value #1. Everything will be sacrificed for them. Is already being sacrificed for them.

                As I said to a normie the other day when they were bleating out the talking points about the Israel-Palestine conflict: “I don’t give a damn about the Israelis. Or Palestinians. Or Ukrainians. Or Russians. Or Syrians. Or Chinese. Or Koreans. Or Taiwanese. I want them to stay in their countries and I want our money to stay in ours. That’s it.”My wife and I watched Team America: World Police and that film is even more prescient now.“See, there are three kinds of people: dicks, pussies and assholes. Pussies think everyone can get along and dicks just want to fuck all the time without thinking it through. But then you got your assholes. And all the assholes want is to shit all over everything. So pussies may get mad at dicks once in a while because, pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes! And if they didn’t fuck the assholes, you know what you’d get? You’d get your dick and your pussy all covered in shit!”

        “This is all speculation based on the available data, but the facts on the ground are making it clear to everyone that Ukraine is finished. The text of this spending bill and the announced weapons transfers that are part of it all point to a rush for the exits rather than a new commitment to the project. The smart money just jumped out the window, carrying your tax dollars with them. That means the next phase is finding someone in Washington to blame for the failure of the enterprise.”It’s more than speculation. You’re mostly correct. The only minor quibble I have is with the search for a scapegoat — I think the administration will just equivocate, fudge, and obfuscate, as is its wont. As far as I remember, no scapegoat was ever found for the Afghanistan fiasco. I suppose one advantage Ukraine has over Afghanistan is the former has been a proxy war rather than direct involvement. Easier here to blame the Ukrainians themselves if scapegoat there must be.

                It seems to one of their, um… innovations. Previous administrations would dissemble and obfuscate and scapegoat. The Bidenbots’ genius lays in realizing that this isn’t necessary. They know that all they need to do is stop talking about something and the loyal regime media does likewise. Then the typical Murrikan with his 10 microsecond attention span goes back to his pr0n.

            That’s the problem I see, since those retards in Congress made such a spectacular show of waving those Ukrainian flags like giddy children after passing the bill. That image might come back to haunt them when their little boy in Keeeeeeve gets the Mussolini or Diem Special, if he’s lucky.

            I blame the deep state and military for the Afghanistan debacle.  Trump ordered them out twice and twice they refused to do anything to make it happen.  They figured they could run out the clock on Trump and that Biden would support them staying there. Then they did the same thing to Biden, but Biden put his foot down and said I don’t care if you’re not ready and ordered the withdrawal.  They had a good 3 years notice that Afghanistan was over.How they managed to screw up so monumentally with no repercussions really shouldn’t surprise anyone.  Failure never seems to have any consequences in DC.

                        I sometimes wonder if they were actually thinking of doing such a chaotic withdrawal deliberately so they can later sell the idea of re-invading (at huge and profitable cost of course) because of the “humanitarian crisis” that resulted.

            Yep, the regime simply banned reporters from asking about those 13 dead US Marines.  The reporters were happy to obey.
It’s the same with COVID.  Nobody’s allowed to ask about it now.  Vaccine deaths are ignored.  The destruction of American kids is also off limits.
The problem they have when they do this is they legitimize people ignoring the government.  The next COVID will be interesting because the last COVID was a combination of fraud, graft, and overthrowing Trump.

        As many will note, the bill funds the emigration of the Palestinians to America and points West; that may be what the pier is for.  Investment and development money will flow to Israel as it has for depopulated Ukraine, so our “investor class” should come out okay.
One web commenter asked: is the bill also funding the next pandemic?Instead of just a canal in Israel, those biolabs in Ukraine need a bit of capital too.

            An announcement has been made that the “Biden” Administration is preparing to start bringing Palestinians here soon–only those with the right papers, wink, wink. You know, so the Israelis don’t have to fight them over there, we have to suffer them over here or something. If there has ever been a more corrupt and despicable government in human history, there is no historic record of it. The transition from terrorists to model citizens happened in a matter of months, all in the name of the Benjamins, as Ilhan Omar rightly noted.

            Check out the What’s Up With Shipping channel on YouTube. The rust-buckets we sent to support construction of the pier either broke down mid-Atlantic, or just made it across the ocean and limped into Cypress for repairs. I think it was 1 ship that made the crossing on schedule.

        Off topic, but –University anti-war sit-ins and protests were one of the main tools that Jews used in the sixties to wrest command of and power in the US away from the old WASP elites.  Fitting somehow that they now are using the power that they gained then to crush university anti-war sit-ins and protests in a way that WASPs were too genteel back then to do with them.

        Today must be hard truth Wednesday.Yes to everything. The Deep State and its backers were counting on raping Ukraine’s resources in order to keep the plating spinning here in the US. They still have not fully given up on that project, and the reason is that they do not have a feasible Plan B for what to do when Russia wins. They have been running up the credit card by printing fake money, hoping on-the-come that Ukraine would produce a revenue stream that could at least make the minimum payments on that debt. But the real disaster is in the coming demise of the petro-dollar. Once Russia wins, the EU will have no choice but to restart purchasing cheap pipeline natural gas from them and then the dollar dies as the world’s reserve currency. When those chickens come home to roost, Western standard of living will decline hugely and a lot of pent up anger is going to get released.If we are smart, that anger will be focused on the root of the problem and not our neighbors.

I understand the Biden admin wants to fund Ukraine $80/billion a year for “reconstruction” for the next 10 years.  The funds will be set up in such a way that future presidents can’t alter it.  Almost a trillion allocated to the most corrupt country in Ukraine.

            One small bit of hope is that the 2020 election fraud will become exposed for all and sundry to grasp. That could lead to activating for the public the Trump executive orders that were put in place and ignored by the media. Some pretext or rationale for showing that the election was null and void, and so is Biden’s admin and any actions.

                A friend in the whore business tells me that Ukraine’s unaccompanied women have been delivered to “the Turks,” a trade euphemism for a Middle Eastern (approximately) coalition—Turks, Pakistanis, Israelis, and miscellaneous Soviets—that administers much of European (and nearby) sex slavery.Typical case: girl flees to an EU capital, hops on Tinder, meets an irresistible local rich man who informs her that she is no longer allowed to date freelance. She agrees or…she doesn’t.The long-stewing plot to destroy the Ukrainians is finally succeeding. They’re a soon-to-be mythical people, like the Circassians, remembered for nothing but having supplied the world with pretty girls, for a while.

        The left will learn something from last night, be assured, unlike conservatives. The Portland Oregon DA, who let antifa run the city for six months in 2020, is already preparing indictments.
For years, conservatives warned lefties, “what they do to us, they’ll do to you, too.” That day is now here.
We will see how they react. I have a feeling it will have a bit more vim and vigor than online rightists.

            Exactly right, Bob. Leftists to their credit to not operate under delusions about the beneficence of their rulers. They get most things wrong but that they don’t. Their problem is impulsiveness, and it may get them gunned down, which could be win-win. The ZOG PROGs will kill the PALI PROGS with gusto, and the clapping seals of Con, Inc., will celebrate the Portland police who kill them.

        “All this calls to mind one of the writers whose work has been central to my blogging since its earliest days, English historian Arnold Toynbee. As my regular readers will doubtless remember, Toynbee lived in Britain in the twentieth century, and so he was understandably interested in the reasons why empires fall. He devoted most of his working life to a sprawling twelve-volume study of that question, which he titled simplyA Study of History.His explanation for the decline and fall of civilizations was subtle but straightforward. He noted that most fallen empires could have recovered from the crises that destroyed them, but reliably failed to take the steps that could have saved them or at least prolonged their existence. In his phrasing, if civilizations had death certificates, the cause of death listed wouldn’t be accident or murder, it would be suicide. A close examination of the politics of failing societies led him to see a crucial change in their leadership as the deciding factor. Societies grow and thrive when their governing classes are able to come up with new and effective responses to the crises history throws at them. Toynbee called such a governing class a creative minority, and talked about the way that its successes inspired the loyalty and trust of the rest of the population.Societies decay and die, in turn, when a formerly creative minority loses its willingness to respond to a changing world, and becomes more interested in shielding its members from the consequences of failure than in finding new ways to succeed. Such a class becomes a dominant minority, in Toynbee’s terms. Since it can no longer inspire loyalty and trust, it turns to bribery, coercion, and sheer institutional inertia to maintain its control over the society it once led and now merely exploits. Once a dominant minority has stopped coming up with effective solutions to the problems its society faces, of course, those problems go unsolved, and eventually bring the society crashing down.”

        I’ve always thought that Trump should propose a series of Brexit style votes to put this stuff to bed once and for all. The first and most important would be about immigration, but I would also include other hot button issues like these stupid foreign wars. Of course, there is no constitutional mechanism for having a national vote of this type, but a non-binding vote would send a message.

        The blackrock investment confuses me, surely they know how this will end so I guess that means russia is just going to let them rebuild the country and, if their operations here in the US is anything to go by, effectively own the place?

        Someone else (my namesake I think) already touched on the elephant in the room. The threatened end of U.S. dollar hegemony. I believe this explains everything. It is existential for the monied interests, those so-called “citizens of the world” who may hold a U.S. passport but aren’t Americans. The American nation isn’t threatened — it’s already been destroyed — only the GAE is.I have to quibble over the notion that the dollar will plummet immediately however if Russia prevails. It will just be an important marker in its decline. It will take a while longer for all the derivative commitments denoted in U.S. dollars to unwind. With the probability that Russia will win in the Ukraine this Summer, the fragility of our financial system, and the looming trainwreck of the U.S. presidential election, expect a very bumpy ride in 2024 and early 2025.

            This is THE whole issue, to which Ukraine and Gaza are just painful side notes. The GAE is heading for the trashcan of history, like all previous empires. The question is whether it can be sent there peacefully or whether it will take us all down with it.

        I wonder if any of the funding shenanigans involving Ukraine violate the Anti-Deficiency Act.  That statute makes it a criminal offense for an executive branch official to obligate the government to pay money in the absence of an authorization or appropriation by Congress.  If Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election (I’m skeptical) his Department of Justice could launch multiple criminal investigations into the arrangements that Department of Defense officials entered into with contractors to provide weapons and supplies to Ukraine.

        Observation: judging by the number of comments today relative to daily, I get the sense that people are both beyond outraged but also fatalistic about Ukraine.
The whole mess illustrates that our government has already collapsed.  We’re just in the looting phase now.
The weird pro Hamas college protests are an indication that this war is also losing steam.  We’re at max burn.

            Not really resigned as such. For me November won’t change a thing because we are way beyond the point where it could do so. DC is done. The only real hope for the US is some kind of split. I don’t want this but I don’t see how it can be avoided. Only after then, and if the damage isn’t too bad, can we have a hope of rebuilding.

        The only way this war ends soon is if Trump wins in November and withdraws US support, or if Putin dies. The US government is trying to foreclose that option by negotiating a ten-year support deal with Ukraine, on the theory that Trump will comply with the terms of the deal. It will be fascinating to see whether the Supreme Court will order President Trump to comply with the terms of a deal executed by the Biden regime.There’s too much opportunity for grift on the NATO side of the equation to stop the war. On the Russian side, a limited, protracted war is in the strategic interests of Russia. This war is driving a wedge between the US and Europe, as European citizens bear the economic brunt of the war. It is also driving the BRICS countries closer together and forging a stronger alliance between Russia and China. There’s no reason whatsoever for Putin to end this war.European countries are already agreeing to deport Ukrainian men who left the country back to Ukraine to be drafted. Next, I suspect the US will lean on central European countries and Baltic countries to draft soldiers for Ukraine. Western European countries and the US will provide materiel and war-planning capacity.

            There is one very good reason for Putin to end it: the future is unknowable. Everything seems to be going along just great for Russia right now but a black swan that reverses Russia’s fortunes could be lurking just over yon horizon. It is hubris to think you’ve got everything, including the future, all figured out. And Fate tends to punish such hubris savagely.

                But what is the end? Russia “winning” in Ukraine, whatever that means, is not the end of anything. It’s not as if the GAE is going to just stand down and give up because the Zelensky regime is forced into exile and Russia captures Kiev or even Lvov. This war will continue on beyond that, with that part of the future very much unknowable.
And that’s why Putin is in no hurry

            The US tried that model with Vietnam. It failed. It failed because the US could not escalate to total war like WWII because Russia and China backed North Vietnam with nukes. Elites and would be elites like Bill Clinton at the time revolted at fighting.Russia has nukes. Thus there is a hard limit before nuclear war with how much the US can escalate. If the elites were not willing to fight and die in South Vietnam in 1967, how are ordinary White men going to be willing to fight and die on the Russian Front to defend Ukraine’s holy, sacred borders when their own nation has none and they are treated like dirt. Without a civilian draft (already floated in UK trial balloons like every bad Regime idea) there is not even enough workers to replace what has been sent to Ukraine for years.

            It will be interesting to see how the Russians approach this. Ukraine is not Moldova. It has a special place in the Slavic identity, especially the Russo-Slavic identity. Russians, including the leadership, look at this war a brother war. I suspect that in the end, the Russians install a sane government, demilitarize the place and make sure it is economically viable. That is in everyone’s interest.

        “It takes time to draft and train men to fight this sort of war. According to Ukraine sources, they need two hundred thousand men right now to be made whole.”..Seems that *might* change. I saw a couple of bordering country’s leaders saying they would send Ukrainian refugees back to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been asking for this for months now. Zelenskyy has been saying for that those refugees include military aged men suitable for mobilization. It has been rumored that Ukrainian impressment gangs have grabbed men off the street and had them at the front line in 3 weeks. I suspect there might be the number of men needed within those refugees and of course, these men will be simple cannon fodder. If I were a military aged man, I’d be moving further West via the EU open travel loophole. Time to leave the camps and go underground.

        No, Ukraine is just getting started. The phase where actual Ukrainians fight is coming to an end. But .. the US and France already have substantial troops in Odessa according to reports. Macron has called for a Europe Wide draft, and Ukraine is joining NATO. Which means US troops on a wide scale deployment are coming, very soon.With Trump about to be disposed of by Judge Meacham by late June, you can look forward to:A. Widespread deployment of US troops to fight Russia in Ukraine.B. A draft (straight White males only) to fight on the Russian front to replace the likely appalling casualties.C. A “work draft” again of straight White older men to work in labor camps for defense industries, the Uighur Solution that elites love so much.All this stuff has been trial-ballooned by Macron, UK retired Defense Secretaries, retired Brit Generals, and various CIA affiliated think tanks like Bellingcat.The people running things can’t and won’t back down. They cannot write it off. They have something pushing them on Ukraine so its escalation all the way.

            If the elites institute a draft (military or civilian) of only straight white male, they’ll quickly have millions of soldiers under arms alright.  Only they won’t be marching on Moscow.  They’ll be marching on London, Paris, Berlin, and Washington, D.C.

                Likely, but they don’t figure that. They figure they still have legitimacy, enough boot-kickers, all those “migrant” military age young men under payroll, and CBDC as a virtual gulag to make things happen. Its why you have Hillary! blithely stating we need “re-education camps” for Trump supporters and Klaus Schwab’s motivating slogan: “you will own nothing, have no privacy, live in the pod, use the pronouns, eat the bugz.”Bug eating is the key. Sadism plays a BIG role in elites, look at RFK Jr.’s statements from the early 2000’s where he blasts Red State Americans as evil and requiring punishment. Elites see themselves as Dracula making their Renfields eat bugz.Don’t underestimate their sadistic urges.

                    Also, don’t underestimate our elite’s fear of their own mortality. If they were willing to grant some concessions to the Dirt People and/or boiled the frog, their schemes might stand a better chance of being realized. The Cloud People certainly wouldn’t face as much resistance if they took the gradualist route and played the long game. However, Hillary Clinton, Klaus Schwab and George Soros are not long for this world. They don’t want their children or grandchildren to immanentize the eschaton. They want their totally controlled Brave New Woke World dystopia realized by 2030 at the latest and if they have to raze what remains of Western civilization to the ground, then that’s what will be done.

                        Even if they agree to sign up, how long will it take to train them, arm them and transport them to 404? A good infantryman takes at least a year to train – assuming he already speaks the language.

            TPTB can wish all they want, but between flying the wings off the existing aircraft fleet, DIE-flavored maintenance, and a lack of replacement production, they are going to find their rapid airlift capabilities are severely degraded.
