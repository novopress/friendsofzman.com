        The mask coming off is the theme. A little push back forces our rulers to reveal themselves.Trump unmasked the GOP as nothing but the Washington Generals of politics. The Oct. 7 protest unmasked American Jewish control of academia and politics. The war in Gaza unmasked the Israelis. The pushback in Europe is unmasking their leadership as nothing more than shills for GAE.The world is waking up to the reality of the West. It‚Äôs why most of the world wants to break away. Now, you‚Äôre seeing that same feeling inside the West. And once the mask comes off, it‚Äôs hard to put it back on and pretend.

            All true, but they aren‚Äôt even bothering with the mask at this point. Americans fully realize they live in a garbage tier dictatorship now, for example, and the Regime just ignores their awareness and continues to go on as before. Material comfort is staving off any actual resistance, so why be worried?

                True. The make-up of the Biden cabinet was the coming out party. Now, we have Harris, who literally nobody believes would be in charge. No one is hiding anything anymore.

                Yes, sadly, it appears only a massive market crash will get the fatass suburban normies off their couches.

                    If the problem is the ‚Äúfatass suburban normies‚Äù, a market crash won‚Äôt faze them. For the most part, their net worth is entirely equity in their homes. Why should they care if Berkshire-Hathaway takes a dive?

                        The more likely scenario is going to be property confiscation, not a crash.  ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôve got 5 acres just outside city limits.  Here‚Äôs 37 Haitians you must allow to homestead on your land.‚Äù  If you fight back, they arrest you and take the land and auction it to Blackrock.
Taxing ‚Äúunrealized capital gains‚Äù is just another way to confiscate property based on some bureaucrat‚Äôs definition of value.  Not far behind:  massive government over valuation of real estate to steal more money.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre as far from property confiscation ‚Äì targeting bad-thinkers especially ‚Äì as people might think.

                                    Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but in Bracken‚Äôs world, diverse people of all races come together to fight for ‚Äúfreedom,‚Äù right?
If so, that is silly.  Only a subset of white men are stirred by talk of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and almost no one else.

                                        Bracken seems to be slowly coming around to race realism.  But yes, there seems to be a deep civnat vein in many former military writers and preppers.

In 2012, he wrote of the upcoming spiciness, ‚ÄúSome locales will divide upon religious or political lines, but they will not be the dominant factors contributing to conflict. In the American context, the divisions will primarily have an ethnic or racial context.‚Äù
True, he considered that unfortunate, but ‚Äúreality is reality‚Äù.

                    Interacted with 3 of these Fine New Muricans just this morning on a short trip. One young male F.N.M. was walking loconically, wrong side of narrow road ‚Ä¶ another F.N.M. comes screaming around curve, older car, out of state plates‚Ä¶ #1 leaps out of the way at the last moment, up onto a steep roadside bank. #2 motors on, no sign of slowing down.Less than a mile later, same curvy road, another F.N.M. comes over a blind, curvy hill, big pickup towing the now ubiquitous lawnmower on trailer. Half in my lane, I swerve, then juke back onto road, to miss raised storm sewer curb, would have taken out my front end or worse.F.N.M. #3 just wheels by, no apparent notice of my existence.

I also saw a local White woman with her mulatto daughter.  It disgusts me, but it‚Äôs literally everywhere now.

                They are brought here to push whites into minority status. Simple as that. That‚Äôs the entire plan. Always was from our real rulers.

The fact that the Biden administration broke the law in granting TPS does not make the declaration ‚Äúlegal‚Äù.

            The mask coming off is the theme ‚Ä¶ The world is waking up to the reality of the West ‚Ä¶ And once the mask comes off, it‚Äôs hard to put it back on and pretend.I have thought over the past four years that the media, security services, color revolutionaries, and voter fraudsters massively overplaying their hand in the 2020 election, and then the Democratic party showing for four years of the Biden regime that the only things that they are good at are lies, hatred, and violence (i.e. not economics and actual governance), that one silver lining to it would be that the 2024 election will be a blowout for Trump. But it looks like there are tens of millions of Americans that hate the chuds so much that they are backing the GAE with its mask off just as much as they did with it on.

                    I have heard it said that the politicians of both the Democratic and Republicans are to the left of their voters, and, from many of the Dem voters that I know, that does seem to me to be the case.

        The voting shenanigans will work as long as the various green/socislist/globalist parties command 50-60% of the electorate. That majority allowed France to slow dow LePen. But that majority is shrinking in terms of the locals‚Ä¶propped up mainly by the immigrants they‚Äôre rushing to import.Here at home, Ohio is too red, so 15,000 Haitians get dumped in a small city. Their only purpose? To terrorize the locals and create a new base from which to launch vote fraud.The solution to a collapse in popular support is to import a controllable minority. So far, the importers are winning. But Sweden is an example of the problem of the savages, best summed up by Mr. Spock in that famous ‚ÄúSpock with a beard‚Äù episode after Kirk asks him how he so easily spotted the evil Kirk doppleganger.‚ÄúIt was far easier for you as civilized men to act like savages, than for the savages to act like civilized men.‚ÄùOhio is now learning this.

            Ultimately, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many locals ‚Äòwake up‚Äô to the reality of replacement immigration.  The only numbers that matter are demographics.  Fully 1/3 of Swedish residents have at least one parent born abroad.  None of the third-world immigrants are willing to accept a generous payment to leave ‚Äì  White women and life-long welfare are powerful inducements to stay.  Europe‚Äôs White birthrate is even more abysmal than AINO‚Äôs.  If 51% of a native White population of even 70% becomes even moderately anti-immigration, it will still be outnumbered (and out armed) by the immigrants and the White globalist traitors.  AINO‚Äôs numbers are the worst, of course, with Whites just above 50% of the population.

                    Precisely. Romeistan wasn‚Äôt burnt in a day. It is totally unrealistic to expect the Swedes to rise up and slaughter or even forcibly expel the savages overnight. The fact that their hearts are hardening against the invaders cannot but be interpreted as a positive development, except by those whose mind and soul have already been burnt to a crisp.

                    You must, at least, apply ‚Äúcarrot and stick‚Äù.  Here we used to call it, ‚Äúsouring the milk‚Äù.  You must make life unbearable to those ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù that do not conform to the norms of the prevailing society.So for example, you cut off welfare immediately for those who are non-citizens.  You immediately deport all noncitizens who are convicted of a crime, or for that matter simple ‚Äúvagrancy‚Äù.  So on and so forth.The voluntary deportation payments are not made to such people, so they run a risk with staying.  You can also use a schedule of diminishing payments to further encourage self deportation.This used to be the norm here in the States after the war when my father immigrated.  You didn‚Äôt even get a resident VISA without a job offer *prior* to arrival. All ‚Äúresident aliens‚Äù had to reregister *every single year*.  Any criminal conviction risked deportation. There was no welfare given‚Äîthat‚Äôs why you have a sponsor, either a relative or an organization.

                        Indeed. The Overton window, until very recently a minute aperture, now looks like the Grand Canyon. And in the most unlikely of places at that. I can well imagine that, if one mooted the idea of paying the savages to go home 10 years ago in Sweden, one would have been subject to litigation. Now it‚Äôs a government program, by gawd! That is nothing short of remarkable.

                            I suspect the ‚ÄúOverton Window‚Äù is why we are seeing the adoption and increase of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù prohibition laws/regulations on social media platforms.  The EU and especially GB are ahead of us (USA), but we are catching up. A Harris term in the White House should allow us to codify what we‚Äôve lost (censorship) through voluntary coercion recently.

                    Likely. Most likely. The litmus test is the next set of rapes and murders against the Europeans. The Europeans need to get organized and do some disciplined mass gatherings. The invaders have effectively conquered the territory since only they mass gather, which is a threat of political violence.The Europeans need to mass gather and prepare the posters, digital reels and placcards that show all of the rape, murder and drug addict victims and the criminal elements responsible. I think another propaganda they should ready and deploy are signs that show the conquered territory they inhabit. This includes their cities and towns where they are the minority and the ‚ÄúNoGo Zones‚Äù that are effectively fully conquered and colonized territory.The accuracy of the words used in the propaganda needs to increase. The JQ can be addressed but it is a lower priority than a mass promotion of the truth of colonization/loss-of-territory/habitat and predation, (2 of the 4 factors of species extinction). This propaganda shows the total failure of the Ruling Regime and the scale and levels of malevolence of we should henceforth call The Great Crime.I saw footage last week of a young and absolutely gorgeous Norwegian woman. She walked through her town and saw, ‚ÄúKill The Whites‚Äù, graffiti on a gorgeuous classic Norwegian building. She complained to the authorities who would not arrest the perpetrators for incitement and hate crimes. They charged a misdemeanor. She was livid and researched the relevant legal statutes. She found out that Norwegians are second class citizens who are liable for ‚Äúhate crimes‚Äù and harsh punishment while the invading colonists are legally privileged and treated as mere petty vandals.Of course that revelation sparked in her the perfectly normal and healthy rage one feels when they find these things out. She is a ‚Äúnormie‚Äù who is now making the rounds on more widely viewed streams.This is going to happen all over Europe. The crisis is existential and the crime is as evil as a crime can be.We are in a worse situation in America. For now, MAGA and the well meaning but empty patriotic gestures of pre-MAGA GAE are a relief valve. No matter the outcome of the election, the crime against us is farther along in its perpetration.The periphery is feeing shockwaves. At the same time, right at the very heart of the Nation that built the empire before being cast aside once their use was not wanted more shockwaves are building up.All across The West a storm is gathering. We must use our minds and long term planning and organizational skills to harness and focus its energies.

            Sweden is omitting an essential step. Paying them to leave cost nothing, quite the contrary, it‚Äôs a large saving because they are already paying them to stay just as we are supporting illegals here, plus you are no longer paying for their future population explosion. So you tell them their next check will only be available when they board the airplane out of country and will continue for a time only so long as they are back in their holes.

        What‚Äôs most interesting about the AfD‚Äôs recent success is its strength among the youth, especially young men. This bodes well for the future. That said, German politics is in utter turmoil. What‚Äôs shocking is that the SPD‚Äôs careful cultivation of Russian relations ‚Äì a hallmark of the SPD since Willy Brandt, continued all the way through reunification and Gerhard Schroder ‚Äì has been chucked in favor of Globohomo. We‚Äôre watching decades happen in years in Germany. Its chaos will have profound impact on the rest of Europe.

        One other factor that might be influencing opinion in Europe is the fact that Russia is winning in Ukraine and Israel isn‚Äôt winning in the Levant.  The vaunted American military technological superiority is being proved to be illusory, although it is still dangerous.  The Russians, Hamas, and Hezbollah are showing that resistance is not futile and even the elites in Europe are starting to take note; the elites in countries such as China and India have been aware of it for a while.  Russia has also proved that it is possible to withstand US and European financnail sanctions‚Äìthe West has sanctioned Russia into prosperity!

The political cordon sanitaire-strategy was pioneered by the Swedes, with their (publicly announced) ‚ÄúDecember Agreement‚Äù of 2014, when all the other parties in the Swedish parliament agreed to never vote with the Sweden Democrats in a vote of no confidence, effectively giving the government dictatorial powers.

            One way to manage the anti-immigrant voting block, is to fracture your managed oppositions into several parties, like AfD/PSW. If AfD gets too big, their voters are going to expect delivery on the promises, but if you‚Äôve got two or three ‚Äúanti‚Äù-immigration parties, none of them will be big enough to be held to account.In 2015, the Danish People‚Äôs Party became the biggest party in the winning coalition, a position that traditionally gives you the pick of the prime minister in a coalition government.Did the DPP do that? Lol, they chivalrously declined, not only the PMO, but cabinet seat entirely! They‚Äôd rather be outside the government pissing in, they explained to their voters, because they‚Äôd have more influence that way.They were decimated at the next election, losing 2/3 of their vote, and today there are 3 upstart clown parties vying for the anti-immigration vote and each are too small for their voters to expect them to have any influence.Meanwhile, the chairman of DPP stepped down after the electoral defeat, got a sinecure job as a director of a big port in Jutland.

                Classic re DPP. Thanks. I don‚Äôt know if you are familiar with Three-Card Monty, and it is rare to see it here any longer, but it obviously served as the model for the fraudulent political systems. As I mentioned elsewhere, they really aren‚Äôt bothered at all that the fraud is increasingly recognized, which indicates a great deal of confidence, warranted or otherwise. I suspect warranted as long as the prosperity continues.

                I think right now the regime parties are doing the outsiders a big favor by doing shenanigans to keep them out of power. Right now, for example, Le Pen is free to criticize the government, without having to offer anything to the disaffected. If she had gained the majority in the National Assembly, Macron would have blamed her for his problems. As it stands, the regime is crippled and is responsible for the ongoing decline in French life.In Germany, I think the bigger concern for AfD is actually winning too fast. They are a bizarre party right now. Every other week they are disavowing one of their leaders. They did this to their top EU parliament candidate, who won anyway. They are nowhere near ready to run a lemonade stand, much less become the majority party. They need to mature and weather the storm. This will attract genuine organizational talent if they can avoid stepping on too many rakes.I think politics in Europe right now are like a forest with lots of dry underbrush. A charismatic, but organizationally sound figure could be the spark that leads to the great fire that consumes European politics. There is no one like this right now, but demand has a funny way of producing the man for the job. Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

                    But at some point, you need to step up to the plate. If you never participate in government, your guys will never get the experience needed to wield real power.The clown aspect is common to all European natpop parties, it was the same with Farage: he ran UKIP as his own personal press agency, staffing it with cronies, incompetents and Tory infiltrators.Farage also habitually violated rules #1 and #2 in public relations: never let the camera catch you with a cigarette in your and never let them catch you holding an alcoholic beverage.DPP sent their top vote-magnet,Morten Messerschmidt (!),to Brussels six months before the election in 2015, and never spoke about mass immigration on the campaign trail. Back then, I thought it was a clever strategy to get moderates on board, but then they pulled the stunt i described above.Only a few weeks later, roaming bands of Merkel‚Äôs guests of honor, started pouring over the Danish border to Germany, an migrate up the motorways, with Danish police stopping taxpayers from using them, and giving the invaders sandwiches and water and so forth.The Danish People‚Äôs Party, who were supposed to piss in, never uttered a peep, they‚Äôd all dived for the air raid shelters.I have a lot of names in my little book, but Kristian Dahl, the former DPP chairman, is right in top, it‚Äôs no competition.

I hope this is correct but I imagine the European security services will simply murder or falsely imprison such a man before he can become too dangerous.  The whole system is rigged to defend the worst aspects of itself at any cost.
Commentors here recently pointed me to materials covering the Dutroux Affair ‚Äì that horrific story made it clear just how vile and ruthless the real rulers are.

                Hasn‚Äôt the governing Social Democratic party been able to undermine the anti-immigration parties by becoming much less immigration friendly itself?  Did the success of the DPP have a role in that?  Germany recently announced ‚Äúborder controls,‚Äù (mostly useless, I know) because of the success of the AfD and BSW.  Can anti-immigrant parties at least influenced other parties in the direction of greater immigration restrictions, even if they are not in the government?

        Ukraine is the bellwether. Winter is coming and it won‚Äôt take much to bring down the rest of its utility infrastructure. That means another flood of emigrants into the EU and the double whammy of high energy prices and social welfare costs. Servicing sovereign debt is at the breaking point and de-industrialization means there is no way to produce your way out of financial disaster. Without a major war, the only option left is to unleash the illegals and foment civil conflict. Then hope the plebs demand tyranny to save themselves. Better for everyone is the lamppost solution sooner rather than later. Less death and mayhem.

        Hungary and Poland have been the wild cards in all this. They have basically told the EU to ‚Äúpound sand‚Äù with the immigration issue despite the threats of fines by the EU. Bottom line is Germany has become too expensive to maintain it‚Äôs industry and had been moving their production lines to both of their neighbors for decades. Hungary is quite happy to start bussing migrants to Brussels and Poland recently passed a law granting soldiers immunity when using deadly force at the Belarus border.Audi, Raytheon, Borg Warner, BASF and dozens of other major industrial sites and pharmaceutical companies have been popping up in both countries. The idiotic decision to shut down of their nuclear power plants followed by the Nordstream disaster were devastating to the cost of energy. VW, Germany‚Äôs largest company and private employeer, is looking at retracting it‚Äôs job security bledge and could let go between 15,000 to 30,000 employees.  This will obviously have a ripple effect across their supply chain and possibly galvanize union workers to side with the AfD in protest if the other parties are unable to influence the VW decision.‚ÄúThe European Commission has triggered a special procedure to deduct the ‚Ç¨200 million fine that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has imposed on Hungary over the country‚Äôs long-standing restrictions on the right to asylum.‚Äùhttps://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/brussels-moves-to-deduct-200-million-fine-from-hungarys-eu-funds-as-country-refuses-to-pay‚ÄúGerman industry is set to pay about 40% more for energy in 2023 than in 2021, before the energy crisis triggered by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, a study by Allianz Trade said on Monday, citing contract expiries and delayed wholesale pricing effects‚Äùhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/german-industry-pay-40-more-energy-than-pre-crisis-study-says-2023-01-30/‚ÄúThe Polish parliament has passed legislation that removes criminal liability from uniformed personnel who use firearms when defending Poland‚Äôs eastern border.

                    This reminds me of how a large part of America‚Äôs ‚Äòmulti-culturalism‚Äô used to be because of our soldier‚Äôs marrying women from where they were based or where they were fighting wars and then having kids and those kids made up our second-generation diversity, and how that became frowned upon because Muslims/tribals/whatever and the military started discouraging it. We went wrong somewhere back when that changed.

            Poland is currently led by a Eurocrat, Donald Tusk, and has around 10,000 GAE troops stationed there at 8 permanent bases.   The US will gladly use Poland‚Äôs seething hatred of Russia to further entrench themselves.  Anyone claiming Poland is going to remain some bastion of anti-migration, traditional culture has another thing coming.  Have you not seen the precipitous decline in religiosity within the country?  It‚Äôs only a matter of time until you see their once devout, Catholic women celebrating abortion just like in Ireland and Argentina.

        I swear, everything in the west all about the F‚Äôing money ‚Äì let them eat cake ‚Äì as long as I got mine, F the clodhoppers‚Ä¶. One problem is, there‚Äôs too much cake around for everyone, at least for the moment.  However, if the tards in charge keep enthusiastically importing millions of swarthy turds from various s***holes, that‚Äôll change and then things could get spicier.

        It is impossible for Europe to revolt politically. We rightly like to complain about the rigged uniparty system in AINO, but when it comes to channeling popular sentiment into ruling class prerogatives,we‚Äôve really got nothing on Europe‚Äôs parliamentary systems, created and refined for this very purpose. Any European revolt must be by other means, and I‚Äôm just not seeing it. Would like to be wrong.

            In my experience, the lunacy of the open society never really took hold in Europe. You see some of it with middle-aged women, for sure, but they are just aping what they see in American media. As a result, I think it will be much easier for their local political class to abandon immigration. Brussels is another matter, but at some point someone will paraphrase Stalin and ask how many divisions does Ursula von der Leyen control?

                how many divisions does Ursula von der Leyen controlAll of those in the Empire, to use ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù a bit loosely. D.C. is not about to allow, say, the Netherlands to ever go rogue without aping the Soviet response to the Gdansk Shipyards. It already goes full Color Revolution on even a mild dissident like Orban in a relatively unimportant country on the periphery. It is the ugly reality of an Empire in rapid and steep decline. If the murder of Daria Dugin didn‚Äôt make you sick to your stomach, tanks rolling in the streets of Amsterdam to put down parents outraged over the rape of their children will.

                        Agreed, obviously. Reality cannot be dismissed as a black pill. There won‚Äôt be adeus ex machina. Opportunities very well may present in the interim, but otherwise it is long-term struggle against bad odds. That‚Äôs far less attractive than LARPing as a Centurion but a necessary reality check.

                    If that‚Äôs the case, the EU is more independent than the Congress. I doubt it would be allowed to do anything substantive about the invasion unless for some unlikely reason its actual bosses made the decision to allow it.

                        Fair point, I was talking about the official, not actual system. And there the EU commission certainly is more independent from voters than Congress is. But then there‚Äôs the real world. And there are peoply in places like New York, London (not 10 downing street) and Schweitzerland whose call they always take.

            The catalyst could be the fall of Ukraine. All the Azov types would have to flee westwards to avoid falling into Russian hands (similar to their Ukrainian SS grandfathers).

        Black pill time. Unfortunately I think all this hoping and awakening is moot. Europe is lost. Immigrants (I don‚Äôt call them ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù because they were invited in) are more fecund, more resourceful, and more chauvinistic than the native populations. The few and proud native Europeans (God bless them) are not enough, and even if they got the spirit of Arminius en masse, they would have to do something that even the most hard-hearted dissident shitposter can‚Äôt do: locate all the brown and black skinned people, and force them into vans and trains and planes and get them out.The immigrants like white society so much that even Swedish remigrationbux aren‚Äôt changing their minds. The only way to preserve the continent‚Äôs demographics as it was pre-1970s is to commit to horrible house-to-house evictions. And that would require absolute determination and resolve and a complete lack of sympathy for those involved in doing it. Even the most racist country on the planet, Israel, has a hard time finishing the job.There is no solution beyond encouraging whites to have babies and inculcating the next generation about the terrible regimes that wrecked their homelands.

                    And as for crypto, if the grid stays up, they will just shut down all the online exchanges and force the ISPs to block all packets with signatures that show characteristics close to the major crypto currencies. High profile examples will be made of resisters.
The same thing will happen with the bullion crowd. You‚Äôll see a few high-profile examples made of resisters that end in 50 year prison sentences or violent death.
The controlled media will smear the examples every which way and insist they could still be living happy lives if they‚Äôd swapped their bullion for CBDC.

                This is perhaps the only real reason for hope. Most Western nations are too gutless to do the brutal work that needs to be done (at least so far). They might, however, be willing to pull the plug on the gibs and make it difficult for the migrants to find work. Once that happens, Sweden, Germany, most of the US, even France, are just places to freeze and starve to death in. The migrants also know their home terrain. They know how to scrape by in poverty there, and above all, they know they won‚Äôt freeze to death.A lot of our migrant problems will self deport once the system doesn‚Äôt reward their behavior. Once they start leaving it also becomes easier to get rid of the remaining ones.

            I completely agree. To be fair, I realize hope, far off like a distant horn, motivates our fine host, Z. I appreciate his content (I am a Green Door lurid voyeur), and I recognize that optimism generally motivates more than pessimism (Schopenhauer excepted), so I try to avoid posting blackpills every day. But our youth just do not have this in them. Not even close. And, they have been corrupted by the influx more than I believe most realize. The future is dark (literally and figuratively).

                        Not just a shit sandwich, just a few days ago a guy applied to 100 jobs.  Once as a man and once as a women.  He was asked in for an interview 9 times more as a women.  From my own corporate working exp. i will say that about matches my exp.  The guy yesterday who asked ‚ÄúAwww shucks why you so down on women?‚Äù  Because they know they‚Äôre being given unjustified advantages, know its wrong, and lap it up and drown in you in man hate in the process.  Ten years ago i‚Äôd say it was a fair bet they‚Äôre unaware, they know they have that advantage now and they exploit it to its full potential.

                            Not denying your anecdote, but what was the job qualifications being asked for?  For example, a woman applying for an engineering job is rare as can be expected and I‚Äôd suspect normally would garner more interviews.
Also interviews are not offers.  Back when I interviewed folk, we were tasked by HR to explain why we had not interviewed more of the traditional ‚Äúunderserved‚Äù (read Minority) population.  We were less beat up about rejections however as that was still left to our judgement as content experts in the field.

White-owned firms, yes. The Indians are only interested in placing their own and need to have natives like me in their database as cover for their shenanigans.

                                                Try what?  What are you getting at?  Continue to bang your head against a brick wall expecting it to fall?  You can lead a horse to water, but you can‚Äôt force it to drink.‚ÄúFaced as we are with this destiny, there is only one world outlook that is worthy of us, that which has already been mentioned as the Choice of Achilles ‚Äî better a short life, full of deeds and glory, than a long life without content. Already the danger is so great, for every individual, every class, every people, that to cherish any illusion whatever is deplorable. Time does not suffer itself to be halted; there is no question of prudent retreat or wise renunciation. Only dreamers believe that there is a way out.¬†Optimism iscowardice.We are born into this time and must bravely follow the path to the destined end. There is no other way. Our duty is to hold on to the lost position, without hope, without rescue, like that Roman soldier whose bones were found in front of a door in Pompeii, who, during the eruption of Vesuvius, died at his post because they forgot to relieve him. That is greatness. That is what it means to be a thoroughbred. The honourable end is the one thing that cannotbe taken from a man.‚Äù‚Äî Oswald Spengler,Man and Technics,Knopf, 1932

                                        My beef with HR was never the composition of the staff, but of the knowledge of the organization. It was almost an instant adversarial relationship as I recall.One example: HR was fond of redoing job descriptions every few years‚Äîexcept they knew little of the positions they were describing/redoing. Anything beyond a menial employee position, i.e., a professional employee, seemed beyond their understanding. However, the university insisted everyone assume some officially described HR position to be employed/hired.One year‚Äîthis was very long ago‚Äîthey passed by me a revised description of their *new* family of Computer Programmers, or Software Engineers, if you prefer that title. Well, the minimal experience required was a BS in Computer Science, *and* 10 years previous work experience.I got the (female) Head of HR on the phone to discuss such a new employment ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. Basically I asked her what she knew about Computer Science and formal degrees in that area and that the university *itself* had no Computer Science department 10 years or so ago!In short, HR had devised a job description that the majority of the candidate population could not meet and perhaps even those currently employed by the university.  The fix was easy however, as we simply changed the experience/education requirements to ‚Äú‚Ä¶any combination of education and work experience deemed acceptable‚Ä¶‚ÄùBut really, how did HR ever help me fill a position? Can‚Äôt think of a single instance.

                            I‚Äôve been tempted to try this. Just submit the exact same resume for the same type of jobs with my name and a female name. After over 1000 applications I‚Äôve given up hope of finding an actual job. This is the tech industry which suffers from a perfect storm of mass layoffs and a cultish pursuit of diversity at all costs. The empty headed xirls and browns they hire don‚Äôt do a good job but I really despise the whole industry now and wish it every possible calamity.

                                Tech is now a mature industry.  I think the only reason its grown to the extent it has, is because its existed in an environment of low interest rates and money printing.  We had 5% interest rates for a freaking year, and look at all the layoffs in tech!  As rates go down pozymandias (which i think is the exact opposite of what should be happening) you‚Äôll have better luck finding a job.  I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that any industry that relies on government money will be woke, and any industry that relies on cheap loans (also due to the government) will be woke.  Back in the 90‚Äôs when i got into computers, the majority of the progamming and games were made by people who really wanted to create a good product.  Now it feels like all the rejects from the art institute with graphic design degrees were given jobs because the government said so and ruin everything.

Be tested by women who couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to their grandmothers and listen to their stupid political views, which would be the same as listening to Rachael maddow. Talking to you about dating is like talking to my boomer dad who‚Äôs been with the same women since junior high. Women haven‚Äôt changed per se, just the rules we make them abide by.

                        Women have been traitorous whores for millennia. This isn‚Äôt the first time a nation has been conquered with the help of its women and male traitors.

                I generally like to point out silver linings myself, and to despair is a sin. But if all the European nationalists win big in the next 5 years, do they take their platform to the ugly logical conclusion? Or do they do what the abortion-obsessed do in this country, keeping a moral issue from actually being solved just so they can get donorbux and a chance to be righteous on TV?

            Blacks and browns are not built by evolution to survive the brutally cold winters of our ancestors. Take down the national infrastructure for electricity/heating and they will either leave or die. Yes, its a harsh solution, but effective nonetheless. And if they choose to stay and fight, they will soon learn that winter warfare favors the Slav. The White Death is a real thing.

                I did not consider that. That is an excellent idea. To assure victory, without being inhumane, I would also put forth legislation declaring all non-Euro foods HARAM so if the immigrants wanted to stay, they‚Äôd have to bundle up AND be forced to eat pork cutlets, pirogies, cabbages and sausages WITHOUT anything more than pepper and salt.
That would at least drive them down to the Mediterranean. Then the Italians/Greeks/Spaniards would have think of their own repellents.

Good. Makes it easier to figure out who goes on the list. Thinking about it, maybe move them to the front of the line of whatever solution is chosen. The fewer social justice harridans, the better.

                Based on my own observations of blacks and browns in Chicago, Michigan and Alaska, I must respectfully disagree. They are quite capable of surviving cold, harsh winters without much infrastructure or the aid of whites. Unfortunately. They may chop up the furniture or rooms, perhaps yours or mine, but most will find a way to stick around and torment us.

                    This is true. So I suspect that what keeps the immigrant around is 1) language help and 2) access to their foodways. Force English-only and bland food upon them, and they will have no choice but to leave white society for access to their Asian apps and street slop.

        DIE initiatives strike again as the sole oiler (resupply ship) for theAbraham Lincolncarrier group runs aground:
https://www.zerohedge.com/military/us-navy-oiler-runs-aground-forcing-carrier-strike-group-scramble-fuel
Basically, this carrier group is now out of action. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the tough talk about refitting and crewing a commercial tanker.
The refit operation would take years to complete. Crewing is already an issue, as shown by the 17 support vessels the Navy is already mothballing due to a total inability to find crewmen.

            Nowhere in the article does it make any mention of who was captaining/piloting the oiler when it ‚Äòran aground.‚Äô  We shouldn‚Äôt be in the Middle East anyhow, but AINO and its military are a joke.
