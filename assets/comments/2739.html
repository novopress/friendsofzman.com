        If this clown had been writing about de-evolution I would give him more credit. Our increasing reliance on technology has, if anything, produced weaker, more timorous creatures, incapable of simple problem solving and unresistant to disease.  If a harsh, cold, rocky environment selects for higher intelligence, a soft, technologically advanced environment will select for limp, craven, and stupid.  I suspect your average Midwestern farm boy from the last century had more sense than the today’s average Art Major at Feminist U.  A society in which a smart tranny considers herself an evolutionary peak is ripe for destruction.
