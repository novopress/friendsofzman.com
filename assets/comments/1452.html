        The majority of blacks live in neighborhoods with severe quality of life deficits.  You can address those deficits and repair them in large measure but not completely.  Doing so means you have to look social reality in the face, and that is something black politicians and the education and social services apprat refuse to do.  The rest of the community also has to be willing to pay for an address to those deficits.  It’s not that expensive, but in so asking, you run up against the resentments of a certain type of suburban bourgeois.  So, we are in an equilibrium of sorts, where everyone’s amour propre demands we stay right where we are.
