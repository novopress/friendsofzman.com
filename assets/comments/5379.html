        Its too little, too late. After the last presidential election, I am convinced that there are too few thinking Americans pulling that voting lever.

        When this stuff started happening in the LA metro area in the ’70s and ’80s, the reponse of the managerial elite was to move their corporate HQs (and by extension, their homes) elsewhere. Kind of hard to do in the case of DC. Still, rather than move the capital, I think that the elites would just carve out a loophole for the Emerald City and its environs in their beloved 14th amendment.
Truly corrupt elites have never had a problem with rank hypocrisy.

        I favor a policy whereby conviction of a violent crime or any act that deprives a citizen – real, American citizen – of life, liberty, or property on the part of a person in the US illegally automatically becomes eligible for execution by hanging upon conviction.

        If only a hispanic gang would slash the tires and leave their tag on cars in the executive section of the Washington Post parking lot. Here and there, a bulb might blink on. For most of the WaPo guardians of public thought, it would just indicate the need for better assimilation of our vibrant new population.

        Yes, indeed, unfettered immigration is an existential threat to the survival of a nation that wishes to remain sovereign and also maintain a distinct culture. The majority of the people in this country get this instinctively, even if many cannot articulate the reasons why.

        I wouldn’t be surprised to see every alphabet agency plus dog leap on this group now that it may effect ‘the managers’.
I’ve always maintained that the best way to fix a problem in the work place is to make it effect a manager, either subtly or directly. The political class isn’t any different really.

        Having lived around the DC area for 20 years plus, I believe that it will take more than this to change the minds of the open border people to change. This stuff has been happening for a while. The MSM is still full of “puppy dog eyed” migrants who remain on top of political correctness.
