        The other advantage of the victor is the ability to frame their victory as inevitable, natural and right. Once this is assumed, all opposition–even when it is mere defense of the status quo–can be framed as aggression against the natural order.Thus, the right is perpetually portrayed as the aggressors in the culture wars even though, most of the time, they’re just fighting to maintain the status quo or be left alone. E.g., when the Catholic Church resists the novel attempt by Obamacare to force it to pay for birth control, it’s accused of trying “take away” your rights or birth control. The left says you have a right to have the Church pay for your birth control, so the status quo is now out of line with the natural order and maintenance of the status quo is aggression.Brooks advice is based on the same characterization of the culture wars as an act of aggression on the part of the right: “Your resistance to your natural betters is tacky and losing you friends. If you would just be quiet and do what we say, maybe you can do some social good and rebuild your reputation.”Of course, it’s an ignorant insult and a ruse. Culture war stuff actually isn’t a big part of what consumes most churches’ energy; charitable works usually outrank it. The problem is that our enemies get to control what our “defining face” is, not us. And, in any case, giving up on the culture war battle of the day won’t protect us from being the bogeymen in the the next battle. Nor is the left too keen on letting us keep what’s left of the distinctive culture that Brooks says we should employ in service of others, much less allowing us to let that culture in any way shape the way we serve.

        A while ago, your theme was cyclical progressive “great awakenings”, wasnt it?  I think you meant by this that reality eventually catches up to progressive excess every generation or so, to be followed by another awakening.But lately you seem worried that the progressive victory is permanent.If I am correctly representing  two views you have, do you see them as compatible?  I hope so.

        If there is one thing where conservatives of a type kept stepping on their dicks from local elections on up it was (is) abortion, which is not even entirely a religious issue. Roe vs, Wade was the worst emanation and penumbra ever to make it out of a slippery mind until  Obamacare and all it’s aftershocks, but abortion was always going to be the way of the land in time due to federalism. Traveling across state lines for an abortion is not the challenge that flying to Puerto Rico was back in the day.What I see is that so many different layers of progressive thought have found their way into the new normal that it is usually impossible to defend a conservative position without defending a progressive inheritance. A practiced manipulator knows this provides a gold mine of advantages. The Pledge of Allegiance is the perfect example.

        The insanity has spread to this side of the Atlantic, too.I have a relative through marriage who is black. Nice woman, but I have to say somewhat lazy; when there is work to be done around the home she somehow finds a paper to read with her sour-faced hero Kanye West featured and somehow misses on the helping out. No matter, she is what she is and accepted for it and is surrounded by people who while they aren’t of her ‘pure’ dark colour they are good people (yes, including me) who have unreservedly welcomed her into their pasty-faced lives. The black lady is regarded highly despite her reluctance to chip in the way everyone else does.The other day this lady posted yet another Facebook post whining about how hard it is to be a ‘person of colour’ and how white privilege is destroying her life. To support her claims she seeks out dreadful articles in the paper the lefties love, The Guardian (better known here for its many typos as Teh Grauniad) which — while usually, though not always, written by palefaces — rattle on about how terrible it must be for the blacks to have to put up with western society.My ‘relative of colour’ never looks round and sees what she has but instead gripes in a sort of psuedo-intellectual way that she isn’t happy either. In her world too there is ‘much more to be done’ and the struggle can never end.I could surrender and join the endless moaners and continual strugglers, but for all their sage advice and no doubt welcoming hugs, I won’t.

        God is not mocked. Or, if you will, the God of nature, or nature is not mocked.America is insane. I mean, really insane. The only place I have been where the feeling of fear and oppression is similar was Qatar. Latin America is violent and poor, and the people are crazy in their own way, but the are not insane. I get off the plane there and I feel a huge weight lifted off my chest.America has peaked. America is not victorious. The insanity of progressive thought control can’t last, won’t last and is ending as America becomes more irrelevant to the problems of the world.
