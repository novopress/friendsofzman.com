        Merrick Garland coordinated the government’s prosecutions in the OK City cases. Most recently, as AG he coordinated the attacks on Trump and put the J6 protesters in the D.C. gulag. Harvard’s finest.

            And don’t leave out Ukraine, the other head of the beast.
A bunch of criminals, operating in secret, risking nuclear war – all because the Czar was mean to their ancestors?
Ridiculous – but it happened.

        Froma post on /pol:Terrance Yeakey was a Sergeant with the Oklahoma City police force. He was the first officer on the scene on April 19, 1995, when multiple explosions tore the north face off of the Alfred P. Murrah building, killing 149 adults and 19 children. Sergeant Yeakey dug through the rubble for hours that day, saving the lives of 8 people.Over the course of the rescue operations however, he saw things which troubled him. Things like undetonated bars of C4 attached to support beams and evidence that a large bomb had detonated directly underneath the children’s nursery on the second floor.More anomalies began piling up. It was learned that none of the ATF officers who worked in the building had gone in that day. And even though dozens of witnesses reported multiple explosions from INSIDE the building, the FBI declared that only one bomb was used, and it was detonated OUTSIDE the building’s north entrance. But how could a single bomb detonated in FRONT of the building, blow the entire face of the building OUTWARDS?Sergeant Yeakey began investigating the matter for himself. Over the course of a year, he collected copious amounts of evidence which contradicted the government’s official story. Before he could go public with his findings however, Sergeant Yeakey died.On May 8, 1996, Yeakey’s car was found abandoned along a dirt road. The interior of the vehicle was covered in blood. Witnesses said there was so much blood one would think a hog had been butchered on the front seat. There was a bloody razor on the dashboard and a bloody knife in the glove compartment. Sergeant Yeakey was not at the scene.His body was eventually found in a field over a mile away. He had been savagely beaten, his wrists were cut, his throat was slit, and he had been shot in the head. No gun was found at the scene. There were ligature marks on his neck and hand-cuff marks on his wrists. No autopsy was performed and the death was immediately labeled a suicide, case closed.

                    I agree – Wikipedia is like Reddit in that both have tons of useful information on them – *except* for anything relevant to modern political power and conflict, for which they are bizarrely slanted.
I think that Jeffrey Zoars point however is that he agrees with you – he was saying that, if even Wikipedia, as corrupted as it is, admits that Yeakey’s death was suspicious, then that shows how unbelievable a suicide designation for him is.

                    In the eighties I worked in a building that was described in an Italian news magazine as a CIA facility (It wasn’t, we were a different three letter agency). That was something that definitely caught my eye, along with the seminude advertisements. With no visible security and outside the facility’s perimeter, truck bombs were suddenly something I thought about when arriving at work.

                And for the 30th anniversary, the National Geographic channel has been programming a so-called documentary on the event. How very convenient to point at the supposed issue of “Right Wing Extremism” while leftists are trying to assassinate Trump, burn Tesla dealerships, and God only knows what else is being cued up in the coming months and years. Oklahoma City is the gift that keeps on giving, repurposed for today.

        To attempt to answer Z-man’s question about whether it is too late:  yes it is.  The last chance for any meaningful fiscal reform (e.g., Social Security or Medicare) was during the Clinton Administration.  Bill Clinton chose to use his political talent for self-indulgence rather than the hard work of reforming the entitlement programs.  Insofar as the FBI and CIA are concerned, the last chance to reform the FBI was when J. Edgar Hoover died and L. Patrick Grey became FBI director.  Mark Feld’s manipulation of Woodward and Bernstein to end Nixon’s presidency meant the FBI became unreformable.  The CIA might have been reformable after John Kennedy fired Alan Dulles (JFK was contemplating a major reform after the Bay of Pigs fiasco), but we know how that turned out!

            Agreed. Demographically, culturally, economically, the Blob, you name it, the 1990s was when we still had a chance to avoid going over the cliff.
But that would have taken serious leadership from a true patriot like Buchanan. Instead, we got the biggest sleaze bag to ever hold office.

                Perot and Buchanan were unable to reach a consensus in the 1990s and consolidate their movements under one candidate or coalition. This was due to Perot’s personality and Buchanan’s own lack of personal wealth at the time (he needed to continue writing and appearing on television, rather than organizing a political party).Perot was impossible to work for and could not attract high-quality political staff (he didn’t want them anyway) and Buchanan wasn’t sure whether he was ever a serious candidate for president and actually wanted eight years in the job. He did not see himself as an historical personage or even public figure, which is why he went completely silent after his medical diagnosis several years ago, and his family remains mute as well.The sadness of it is that we didn’t need Perot in the presidency. He would’ve been an awful president. We needed him to bankroll someone who would’ve implemented his ideas. He didn’t need to be a political candidate; he was a terrible one. He refused to listen to this advice, thought he was the only one who saw the future, and from many accounts, died an unhappy man as it came to fruition.

                SSI is the easiest to “reform”—even now.  The problem is that the first party to take a stab at it, gives the other party a “scare issue” by telling folk you’re gonna lose your benefits, or grandma will starve, etc.  The issue then becomes a no win situation for either party to reform.In any event there’s little reason to do anything since by current law, the benefits take a haircut—across the board—by whatever shortfall percentage occurs after the “trust fund” runs out.  Currently estimated at about 25% in 2030, but that changes frequently.If Trump was serious, he’d grab this issue however.  He’d begin by promoting a rework of the law to *assure* full benefit payment regardless of revenue shortfall in the program in 2030.  Give it a catchy name for the rubes.  Then dump in the appropriate corrections for a reform that should last through the “baby boomer” cohort.Boomers are currently the rat passing through the snake.  Once we are gone, SSI is reasonable sound as currently written.

                    Truth. Though I suspect there’s enough and more if one just turned the dial on disability and minor survivor benefits down. I know of people who adopted only those who were getting those checks, and who kicked the kids out the door when they turned 18 and the checks stopped coming in.

                        Bingo!  That ‘s where SSI really became insolvent, the excessive extensions to survivors and disabled—without adjustment of the program.  For example, I believe I read years ago that when Obama took office during the advent of the Great Recession, within a few years people on SSI disability doubled!  Typical government BS.
(P.S. I’ve not confirmed the above.  As my major prof used to say regarding math proofs,  I leave such for the student…)

        While most of the government is going through at least some level of manpower reductions, contract cancelations, and other RIFs, which two are conspicuously not?FBIDOJAnd I’ll throw CIA in there as a bonus.DoD has been limp d*ck about it, but even they are trimming at the edges.As fast as Trump moved early on, he got talked out of firing hundreds of thousands of probationary employees on Day 1.  Since failing to do that, the permanent government had a chance to dig in for the long war in the courts.Frog marching FBI and DOJ officials involved in the various coup d’etat plots and fraudulent criminal trials would go a long way toward showing his supporters what is needed.  But they’re too worried about what Democrats and bureaucrats will say on TV.  And by not doing this, he’s leaving a fully armed enemy army run loose inside the government.It’s only a matter of time until they entrap Patel in some sort of scandal, probably involving misuse of govt money.  That’s a popular one.  Then we’ll get a Company Man at FBI.  Game on.  Same at DOJ with Blondi.  But she’s a moron, so they’ll just work around her.

                Yes, and we will be terrorized under the guise of “cracking down on anti-semitism.” They started with green card holders and are moving to naturalized citizens and will find a way to go after native born Americans of European descent who criticize the tribe a little too much. And if Trump’s administration doesn’t get us, then President Ocasio-Cortez will take the tools that Trump’s team developed and apply them to “racism” and “transphobia” and whatever, in the exact same way Obama took Dubya’s domestic GWOT strategy and unleashed it on White people.

                    “Yes, and we will be terrorized under the guise of “cracking down on anti-semitism.””
Definitely. So I see no reason to give them any additional ammo to take out Zman. You may see the distinction between antizionism and antisemitism, but I guarantee you, they do not. And they are not amused. Nor are they particularly merciful or forgiving…

One could at least be white enough to not take Zman down with him. Z tends to use very oblique references, when he does so at all.

                                I can go read the news and see the Trump administration brag about what they are doing to “fight antisemitism”.  Trump’s actions on this are unprecedented and they have purposely picked targets who committed no crimes, and they’ve talked about that.Does one need to be oblique when discussing the same things the Trump administration is talking about? Does one need to avoid talking about this stuff when it is one of the top things the Trump administration is talking about?

                This is not a an unreasonable approach. In a multi-ethnic empire internal security forces are the backbone of the public order. Even if FBI was to be abolished, something else would’ve to replace it and take over the Praetorian duties.One of the major features of post-communist transformation in Eastern Europe was the near-immunity of the state secret services to any institutional purges. Even if the names were abolished, most of the higher officers simply transitioned into the new intelligence/counter-intelligence/security apparatus.Personnel verifications were applied mostly to the members of the police and internal security members with proven criminal acts (operations illegal under the “communist” law) and not even all of them as lots of evidence regarding the death squad activities was destroyed.The lustrations were either partial or non-existent as the emerging mafia cartels were filled with former collaborators of the secret services and maintained strong influence in the “new” politics.

                        East Germany dissolved and was essentially incorporated into the West. Unlike in other Warsaw Pact republics, the security apparatus was in no way indispensable for the new regime that came with its own institutions handling those matters (BfV and BND). Joachim Gauck didn’t need to watch his back when penetrating the Stasi archives.I don’t consider Angela Merkel to be particularly affected by her past unless there was an ex-KGB blackmail we don’t know about, that could’ve shaped her policy.What we DO know however, is that theBundesrepublikregime has no qualms about hiring ex-Stasi workers like Anetta Kahane to monitor “extremists” on the web. There is no such thing as “disgraced” agents, only the ones who are useful or not. Keep that in mind when getting excited about another drama in the police state. In South America there’s a thin line between the criminal underworld and the security services. As Mexicans are filling the postions of police officers in the LA for example, I imagine that the skillset for handling the cartel activities (like police corruption) will become highly sought after.

            Bondi seems to be emblematic of Trump’s choices. Too many feckless girlbosses. She means well but is out of her depth. For example she could fire on her own authority James Comey’s daughter Maurene Comey, working for the SDNY. Comey is neck deep in the Epstein case coverup. After Bondi stepped on a rake mishandling the “release” of documents, she needed to rectify her mess. She’s done nothing significant to punish those stonewalling her. Outside of USAID it looks like most of the Swamp has little to fear.

                    He fired the 94 US attorneys representing each district of the federal system. These are Senate-level appointments. He couldn’t fire the assistant US staff attorneys in each of those 94 districts named by Biden (and Obama, they’re still there) without firing thousands of attorneys, among whom Comey is one.I mean, he could, but it would’ve frozen federal district court activity for a year, maybe more. It would effectively be killing it. Given the critical importance of the work done by those offices on actual criminal matters (rather than politically-charged ones), such a move would be unthinkable. The legal system would collapse.

Line attorneys in US federal districts do a lot of heavy work on some really bad people. Do you have any idea the kind of shit that ordinary people get up to every day? Probably not. If it weren’t for these attorneys jailing them you’d be meeting them in your Dunkin Donuts once and that’s all. Thankless job, as the response to this comment indicates.

                                    Those are not federal actions. Since the Administrative Procedures Act (1947?) the agencies themselves get first crack at violations of agency regulations, using judges hired by the agency itself, clearly a conflict of interest.
That bankrupts most people, so they never get their chance on either an Article III court or even a district court created under Article I powers.

                                        Yes. And executioner was added to judge and jury once the individual agencies got SWAT teams who were at the disposal of the administrative courts. If I recall correctly, even the USDA has a SWAT team. EPA certainly does.

                The entire thing has been a joke that anyone with a room temp IQ saw coming.  Nothing gets released that would implicate anyone in government.  They would never allow the rubes to see that.  Also, for all of her tough talk Bondi has been emblematic of the left wing girl boss type who can accomplish nothing.  No one of significance has been arrested or punished in any way.  Nothing has really changed much.  Even the DEI crap that has been normalized has gone unchanged.  It’s still alive and well in the private sector and in the public sector it is just being secretly run and changed to a different name.  But we did force government workers to go back to their offices.  The reason for all of this is that there are no real consequences for any of this.  Washington is business as usual.In 2029 you’ll see a leftist installed and Whites will be further persecuted for electing the bad orange Hitler.

I’m still scratching my head about this one. The boards have a fiduciary duty to the stockholders to maximize value, i.e., not piss money away on worthless DIE crap. So where are the class action suits? Normally at least a few ambulance chasers could be trusted to skim their share. Why not this time?

                        It’d mean attacking collective female power. So DEI — which is just a subset of feminism — remains firmly in place. Wasn’t even shaken.
Women don’t want DEI destroyed and men aren’t up to it.

                        When an obvious market gap goes unfilled, or a seemingly necessary function is left undone, that means it’s forbidden in some non-obvious way.
“The bar”—in the old sense:the profession—decides what lawyers can and can’t do. We’ve seen many punished for representing Republican defendants, fired for arguing from the Constitution, disbarred for being “Trump lawyers,” etc.
It’sthe law(actual).
More broadly, no American institution is anti-“DEI.” Some of them should be, right? Most, if they were representative/market entities. But they’re not.None.

                            True. The bar itself is the problem. They are the ones who are going after John Eastman for offering an opinion to and defending a client. The bar used to (and still does) defend nogs and head-choppers caught on friggin’ camera raping and murdering, but someone who disagrees with the “revealed wisdom” of Lefthood, is anathema…
Feminist? Meh. Doesn’t explain the head-choppers or the dots, does it?

Guys like Trump think the more baksheesh you drop on lawyers, the higher performance received. East Coast  and Beltway lawyers and firms are remarkably unreliable despite their bills. Poor Rudy Giuliani.

                To me, Bondi seems like another Bill Barr, but with long blonde hair, and not carrying around too many pounds; i.e., looking to preserve the institution, regardless of the incredible damage that institution has in the past done, or its potential to do untold damage in the future. Or maybe she’s just wary of harming her career arc by antagonizing the deep state by taking her oath to defend the Constitution seriously. Either way, it’s not a good look. We are still in the time of weak men (or women) making hard times, and not yet in the undeniably hard times that draw forth strong men (or women).

            I used this metaphor as a throwaway elsewhere, but the more I thought about it, it makes good sense.Trump 2.0 is like the football coach who used the prep time leading up to the big game to come up with a really dynamite set of scripted plays for the first couple of drives, and found themselves up a couple of scores while the other team was on its heels. But now they’ve reached the end of the scripted plays and are just floundering about having to make calls in real time because they don’t really know what they are doing. Even worse, Trump’s loyalty to his people, while admirable by itself, is leading to him using distinctly minor league talent in a major league game.Bondi is shaping up to be an even bigger train wreck than Sessions was in Trump 1.0. I really hopes she’s gets pushed out to go to that Fox News job she is angling for sooner rather than later.It is the same problem in both cases. What the Trump administration really needs in AG is someone with the stones to go after rich and powerful people and put them in prison. Being imprisoned sucks even worse for rich people, so it’s not an idle punishment, and a lot of this crime has been so blatant and in the open that DOJ doesnt even really need the FBI to do anything to make cases. They just need someone who is ballsy enough to make big names hurt.

                If Trump hadn’t had those Project 2025 folks to script the first month for him, he’d have started looking feckless a lot sooner. Right now it’s looking an awful lot like his first administration.

                    Yep. I don’t really expect much more from Trump 2.0 at this point unless he radically changes the people around him, but even then, his picks on advisors have been pretty middling across now 2 administrations.

                I know this sounds like “if only the tsar knew” (which is anti-Russian propaganda but bear with me), but Trump once again is not going with his instincts. His instincts on tariffs are correct, but he’s listening to bad people who are giving him contradictory advice. And, needless to say, he is listening to the Zionists who are telling him to focus less on illegal immigration and more on people protesting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. This is insane and burning up all his political capital with everyone outside of 65 year old Hannity watchers. .

            “Perestroika” (“restructuring” of the economic and political system) didn’t work in the USSR and it won’t work here for the same reasons.
A staggering percentage of the Soviet population was plugged into and directly/indirectly skimming off the top.  Coupled with a leadership that looked like a hospice ward for ancient people.
Economic reform: impossible. Secure elections: impossible. State police forces: barely contained but plotting their comeback.

        has the US govt ever told the truth about anything?   USS Liberty, JFK, Mena, Iran Contra, Pentagon Papers, etc etc etc.  to me this is an unsolvable problem as it is rooted in human nature and group dynamics.  is it better at the state level (honest question)?  if so, maybe the answer is to disband all federal agencies not enumerated in the constitution, and let them reform at the state level.  imagine sending your sons off to fight and die for such a mendacious and unworthy system.

            As I was theorizing the other day re: the Boeing Starliner cover up, that is, why couldn’t they just say it was broke on day 1, instead of spending 9 months lying about it and then admitting it after the astronauts returned (and having that buried in the busy news cycle)…. I believe it’s because they are in a “business” (MICOM/intel, of which Boeing/NASA is a part) in which lying is frequently legitimately required, and after a long period of time of such lying, they kind of forget how to tell the truth. After so much lying, eventually lying becomes SOP. About anything. About everything. It becomes first principles to lie. If they were going to issue a press release, it was to lie. Because that’s what they do. They no longer know how to do anything else. Something similar happened at the DOJ/FBI, but for even less pure reasons.

                I have a two relatives who were in Intelligence, one military, one Federal; the military one is a stalwart Christian churchgoer, and could not talk without telling a lie for decades. (The Federal one was just a snake.) Something they did to his head messed that boy up.The CIA guy on youtube said they look for someone with trauma in their childhood; that person is hungry for external validation, and suspicious of other people. Once they find a someone or an institution that accepts and validates them, that institution becomes the sole authority from whom they will accept direction and validation. They become true believers, loyal to the cause.(The CIA wants people who are social, sympathetic, and feel deeply.The FBI screens for people who are cold and empirical.)

Mendacity is genetic; it is determined at conception by the particular spermatozoon which mates with the particular ovum.
There’s nothing you can do about it, short of sending the liars to the gallows [or spaying/castrating them so that they cannot reproduce].
BTW, apparently (((Albert Bourla)))’s recipe for culling the herd depends upon a slow multi-generational genetic destruction of the gonads [particularly the ovaries].

        The Kash Patel directorship is past the point of no return evidence in a second sense. It is widely known that Garfinkle and his boys at the FBI were embedding in churches and information gathering and even persecuting Regime apostates. The right thing to do in a reform that should also be seeking to preserve/reform a Christian nation, would be to put a Christian in charge. It should be a Christian whose church was directly targeted. That Christian should then immediately call Garfinkle and his agency up for a non-show trial.What did they do instead? They installed a, “new American”, who is not in any way American. In the ultimate insult, he took and swore his oath, not on a Bible, but on the Gita. Was that an intended piece of symbolism that we are past reform and America is gone, or was it just an oversight by uncultured businessmen hopelessly underwater trying to run a civilization? In the end, it doesn’t matter. Intentional or not, it symbolizes the completion of our dispossession.There are other aspects of the FBI to consider. One, it is trained in anti-hate by the ADL – essentially an agency of a foreign power. You mention AMGreatness the other day. Before they closed their comments section, people were mentioning this and moderators were chasing those commenters off. The concept of, “hate”, as a crime is antithetical to Anglo-Saxon civilization; Greco-Roman too I believe. Yet the top domestic law enforcement internalizes a doctrine and a mission that stands in direct opposition to our civilization and enforces the notion of thought and speech crime.A real bake your noodle thing to consider is that Steinlighter proposed in 2001 that the solution to mass immigration threatening to dissolve the ruling people’s power was not ending mass immigration. It was to form an alliance with Asians in order to, “divide and conquer.” Makes the ADL-FBI relationship and the appointment even more interesting. I doubt things are that elaborate, but then again it is right there in front of you begging questions.This thing is hopelessly corrupt: spiritually; ideologically; financially; morally. Just go out to dinner in a middle class area and look at the ethnically disfigured, aesthetically bedraggled diners. They are dining and the wait staff is mumbling in ten different languages and nobody bats an eye. Do you think those people give the first crap about reform? Do you think they think beyond the momentary pleasure and the banal conversations and probably the high from the gummy or vape they are enjoying?This isn’t said to demoralize. It is always the organized minority that through diligence, discipline, sacrifice, patience and faith can take the upper hand. If we resolve to be that organized minority and do what it takes, those with too many tigers by the tail will eventually fall away exhausted. Opportunity will arise.

A few days from now, the Son of Man who had no human father will be hanging out on his cross. (Latinos love to reenact this. It’s considered a great honor to be the one, I hear.) He’ll be hanging and in a bad way. Then he’ll cry out in despair, “OMG, why have you [who is one in being with me] abandoned me?!”
Assisted suicide is forever, or until rebirth, presumably in a lower state than during the life which ended with self-murder.

                This is typical of Indians (with a dot).  “Cash” Patel’s full given name is Kashyap Pramod Patel.When I say typical, I speak from experience with the people.  Indian names are impossible for typical Anglos to pronounce.  We butcher them without experience in the language.  Hell, any foreign language.  😉Indians I’ve encountered don’t get upset, they simply change their name slightly to something Anglos can pronounce and happily use them.  Call it a nickname if you will.  They honor their parents and their tradition by retaining their given name, but use the bastardized version in the USA.  Not entirely different from monikers issued at Elis Island immigration in the 1920’s.I sympathize.  My given name, albeit of Northern European heritage, on my birth certificate is not, and was never, used throughout my life.  It honors my foreign born grandfather, but that’s as far as it goes for this *American*!

                    Ellis Island did not ‘issue’ monikers.  They wrote down what they heard as best they could, and transcribed what was written by the boat agents at the departure (i.e. non USA) point.  Some people chose to change their names at that point, but it is yet another lie that refuses to die that US immigration agents blithely changed immigrants’ names.

                        Dunno about Ellis Island, but my ancestors had the “Gj” trimmed from the start of their name. Dropped to just “J”. A friend’s ancestors had “Gafkjen” changed to “Guffien”, which I know was Ellis, and I know was that’s because of how it was pronounced. I also have a friend with similar spelling where it was retained. Again, through Ellis.
My conclusion: some immigration officials were less that scrupulous in preserving the original spelling.
Which should hardly be surprising, nor anything at which to take offense.

                            Like I said- they wrote what they heard and rendered the sound in English as best they could.  That’s a lot different than ‘assigning’ new names. These immigration officials were not rocket scientists, and all the languages probably sounded equally alien to them.

                Yes. Steinlighter proposed the alliance in 2001 as a way to build a coalition that, since he didn’t mention ethnic Europeans, excludes us. The Empire probably didn’t care since it salivates at a market of 1.4 billion and takes them in as a part of the horsetrading empires do to “win” in geo-political games. Align with us against the Soviets! Why? Well, we’ll give away our hotel industry and our gas station industry. Here take these subsidies and grants designed for the negro and give them to a colonizer class. Now we are here.It is one more set of kegs on the pile.They will a part of the alien satraps who will help to manage the decline. It will be one more alien group resorting to rapine that will only hasten it rather than reasonably manage it. I foresee a day where those of us aware of existential issues will create zones through clear and hold. Here, we own it all. We are a long way from that, but it will come as those with the will and the resolve and the forces of reality reawaken that in us.As for the coalition. As the goodies dwindle and what guilts one group doesn’t another, a lot of infighting will ensue. Out in the hinterlands a million Alerics must be nurtured.

            Anyone who seriously thought it was a good idea to appoint a Subcon to head the FBI was a rank idiot. Patel probably is working on a way to embezzle civil forfeiture money at this point. And, yes, the ADL is a foreign asset and represents a group that openly bribes members of Congress, and using it as any type of moral template is ludicrous, which means it probably has a great relationship with ol’ Kash. I’ll go one step further: Patel and Co. probably aremorelikely to arrest dissidents than was Garland/Garfinkel, who wanted to turn the USA into Gaza. Patel’s goal is replacement, not reform.

                I have faith it won’t be too late. We have to understand that the betrayal we have undergone is probably without precedent. If 30% make it that is a good number. That is my prediction. Then another 15% or so will come late but they will come. The early birds will have to decide if the gates are opened and to whom.We must not despair. We must see that a good number will remain and forged by necessity rise again to greatness. I wholly believe that will happen. Will it be the what it once was. At a smaller scale it can very well be. Perhaps it will be better that way. A small scale of 90 – 120 million connected to a Pan European Imperium of 350 – 400 million can and will be formidable. We must trust in our innate greatness and that it will be re-awakened. It will take a long time but it will happen someday.

        What a change in worlds. A point of no return, indeed. I was interviewing for a job at a top liberal university’s international relations school on the East Coast that day. Hundreds of people, many of them former top government officials, in several large connected buildings. There was a television showing the news coverage in the dining hall to maybe 80, 90 people at a time, watching in silence.No police presence, no sudden “emergency alerts” over the PA, no “beefed-up security out of an abundance of caution” — people sat stunned, or crying, or whispering, some of them leaving for the day or going back to their offices. Sitting or standing: no fidgeting, no outbursts, no need for pills or gummies, aware that one was an adult and expected not to act out in public like a homeless person shouting on the subway.There was no security theater at all. Nothing. Just adults, behaving like adults do when confronted with something hard to comprehend. Nobody thought Muslims were about to storm the campus. No bollards needed to shoot out of the ground like punji sticks. If there were cops, they were watching the tv, rather than running around in yellow vests shouting about “protocols” and locking down the school.I got on an Amtrak train car that night — at a train station with no security, paying cash for a ticket on the train — and went home to watch “Nightline.”This must sound unimaginable to a young man starting out today, as I was then. America is now a giant mental asylum for the rest of the world. All of these behavioral constraints must sound Victorian compared to what young people have grown up witnessing and being told to permit if not emulate.

        The FBI has done some incredibly egregious shit, including entrapping clinically mentally ill people and conducting show trials for propaganda purposes.Couple of examples: in Upstate New York, they took a homeless street Negro who had a borderline retarded IQ, suicidal tendencies, and had been previously committed to a mental institution and convicted him for being an “ISIL terrorist” by encouraging him to stab people. He had no weapons and no money to buy one, so the FBI actually took him to Walmart, bought him a knife, and then arrested him.Hochul’s husband put him away for 20 years:FBI wanted terror suspect Emanuel Lutchman as informant, grandmother saysIn another case, they took a white kid who was a diagnosed, full-blown paranoid schizophrenic on disability for mental illness, with previous commitments to a mental hospital, and entrapped him as a “white supremacist” who supposedly wanted to bomb Oklahoma City:Family: FBI knew Oklahoma bomb plot suspect is schizophrenic – CBS NewsThere’s actually a LOT of manufactured cases like this — arguably a majority of them, if you pay attention to what is actually going on. Most people don’t. They buy the “back the blue” bullshit and swallow the propaganda whole.

            In addition to the certified crazies, they must celebrate with scotch and cigars when they find somebody like Thomas Crooks. There are committed fanatics by the shipload who will attend a rally or even an antifa riot, and then there are the Thomas Crookses.

            The guy who shot up the Muhammad art exhibition did it with his FBI handlerstanding behind him.
The sheer mass of public fedposting since the Luigi thing, cops trying to get right-wingers to worship him or one-up him out of envy, is overwhelming. Imagine what Discord is like. Or Signal.

                Yeah. There’s a LOT of these cases. There was a moron in Schenectady some years back who, over a few pitchers of beer, said he was going to build a “death ray” like “Hiroshima on a light switch” and put it in the back of his truck.They labeled him a “Klansman” (LOL) and gave him 25 years for “attempting to create a weapon of mass destruction.”I’m convinced that the 18-year old retard who shot the Negroes in Buffalo was put up to it by the FBI. He apparently invited a “retired” agent to watch the shootings on livestream. That fact was conveniently memory-holed…Feds probing if retired agent had notice of alleged Buffalo shooter: report

        Everything is probabilistic…and tail risk is getting “fatter”.  McVeigh’s unwillingness to defend himself always struck me as odd, unless there was a threat out there to do something far worse to his family. The blob is embedded and the whole USAID fiasco demonstrated (to my surprise) just how big and complex  a self licking ice cream cone they’d managed to construct. Soon Patel and Bongino may be lauding “the good and dedicated FBI agents” they’ve found out in the field. Love or hate Musk, he has a decent track record of “seeing the future” and he thinks this fight is existential.  I expect we’ll be in for an interesting summer. Prepare.

            And then there are people who swear that McVeigh “moved” after he was executed. I can’t recall the specifics, but there was a strong suspicion that the execution was a sham. (No doubt this has been scrubbed from the internet.) And look at Epstein. Was that really his corpse that they wheeled out for everyone to see? Call me skeptical, but would any of us be surprised to discover that he’s living it up in a foreign country? These people lie about everything — and then vilify anyone who questions it.

                    This. I always thought the McVeigh stuff was a little too convenient. Militias turning him away because they thought he was a plant. I figured he was just given a sedative and put into witness protection. Then a month later or so, I realize those… things would have no qualms about silencing their own asset permanently.

                Ain’t nobody gonna change my mind. I was parked on some shoulder on the I-40, and watched the original 5 pm news broadcast that showed a team carrying out what they reported was a bomb, on a stretcher. The reporter said they believed four more were in the parking garage underneath, strapped to pillars.That broadcast and clip was never repeated, and is scrubbed as far as I know from all media. (I was watching on a tiny battery-powered b&amp;w TV.)One close relative was a state medical provider living not too far away, and on one of the response teams. He verified the scuttlebutt; it wasn’t til later they cooked up the changing story about manure in a Ryder truck this time in jugs, that time in a pile, this time with this kind of fuse, that time with another as being the sole cause of the explosion.And the “sudden emergency breakfast meeting” for all FBI/ATF personnel next door? And making sure there was no warning to the kid’s childcare center in the building? These demons are beyond evil.McVeigh racing along at 90 mph with no plates, showing the officer his unregistered gun in his jacket and asking if it was okay to carry? Terry Nichols’ dozens of phone calls to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed’s nephew and having met his Filipina wife in the same small Philippine town where “al-Qaeda’s” top IED bombmaker was teaching a class?Traversing Oklahoma weekly, I caught a radio show where the OK governor hosted governors of several states in an on-air talk show. Even they didn’t buy the official story, and mentioned the woman reporter having boxes of evidence and documents rejected by the FBI as being “one day past the filing date.”My previous boss and half the crew were from Oklahoma City, I was registered out of OKC, and have been there or through there a million times. Nah. This one’s kinda personal.

                That was reported along eye movement – i.e. he was still alive long after he was “executed” it was “death twitch” type stuff….The best part is though that the Hearse carrying his body to be buried after the “execution” got in a crash – it was found there was NO body in it, nada, no McVeigh – LOL – then it was quickly stated when this came out somehow that the Hearse was a “decoy” Hearse – all this was quickly buried soon thereafter and never mentioned again- and it’s hard to find now but it 100% happened.McVeigh wasn’t executed at all and was in on an op as some Military SF Intel type “super soldier” (he told his sister he was by the way and there are photos of him in the Military at a time long after he was supposedly out….) to shut down the Militias in the USA that were booming at that time for the Clintons/ADL/Globalists who wanted them gone – Whether the actual bombing theFeds didgot out of hand or not is another question (No Feds were in the Building when it was blown up, a near impossibility given the number of them stationed in it)- it was definitely a Fed Op

        For the various criminal organizations fundedby the American taxpayer,either directly (DoD and the three-letter agencies) or indirectly (the Mossad, Pakistani ISI, etc.), failure isn’t a screw-up, it’s a business plan.Take the Afghan War, a 20-year effort in which neither the Russians, the Chinese, nor any other potential adversary were available to back America’s enemies. In other words, America had to fund both sides in that conflict. This was accomplished through its ally Pakistan or via “taxes” paid by local U.S. contractors. Given the circumstances, you’d suppose the U.S. would have been able to pull off at least a stalemate there. But the U.S.-backed puppets skedaddled on the day of its withdrawal. There were no consequences for any of the Americans involved.So what about the current project in Ukraine? This has been overtly funded by the U.S. and its allies, while covertly run by the DoD and CIA. You might think its denouement would lead to a reassessment of U.S. spending priorities, but you’d be wrong. Failure there demands even greater expenditures on overpriced and ineffectual weaponry. Of course, none of the U.S. general officers directing the conflict will suffer any consequences.And its most public advocate, Victoria Nuland, has failed up to a comfortable sinecure in academia, probably better paid than the prior public service she made such a hash of.You see, as Trump is about to find out, the only ones to pay a price in America’s mafia state are those suspected by the blob of working onwinning.

        What’s up with the blackpilling all of a sudden?We got the best possible timeline: a bullet misses Trump, he chooses JD and Tulsi, hangs with Rogan and Elon, wins the popular vote, and is making the Democrats look completely out of touch and feckless. By the way, Israel is losing support among the rabble. I am not a MAGAtard, but what more could you reasonably want here?We might be a cursed country, but we are certainly NOT the UK or Canada, France or Germany, which are far, far deeper into the pit than we are. There is hope in the US. Trump and his team won’t do everything we want him to do, and he will lose some battles with the ex-Regime. Nothing is perfect, and it is often far from perfect. But let’s see who wins the 2028 election before we start acting like Morgoth’s Review.

            because trump is reverting to the mean established in his first term.  tons of announcements and precious little accomplished.  for all the supposed DOGE savings, the budget for this year is unchanged.  deporting a handful of miscreants trumpeted as a major accomplishment.  unending whining about judges, but no push back.  0 arrests for major crimes by officials and politicians.  and worst of all, the GOP is still absolutely useless and inactive.  in short, nothing has changed; this is the J J Abrams version of Trump 1.0

                DOGE was BS from the start.  When they announced they were going to save 1 trillion dollars i knew it was BS.  You know how?  Because i could save 2 trillion just by reverting back to the budget at the end of 2019.  A “pandemic” caused .gov spending to spike by 2 trillion, we have nothing to show for it except for many questionable “causalities” during covid and its been three years since covid ended.  A commentor yesterday talked about confidence being the basis for economics, and i replied that its the basis for fraudulent economics.  Look at covid, an economic crisis that had to be covered up with a subject the common man has no expertise in.  These people are the definition of evil.

                    Cost-cutting never was the ultimate goal of DOGE. The purpose was to eliminate a patronage system, and that has been largely successful. Even I am somewhat shocked by the inability to get astro-turfed protestors in the aftermath of the defunding. Whether that matters, of course, is another issue.

                    Agree, but the economic “crisis” of 2020 was nothing of the kind. Other than for gov’t supremacists, I mean. Someone earlier commented that a bunch of people making a living and building real self-esteem through accomplishment, possibly seeing a better future in the offing for their kids doesn’t want or need an all-encompassing govt.
Gov’t supremacists must smash that, and make everyone dependent. That’s what covid was all about. Demoralization. Churches deemed non-essential, casinos, liquor stores, strip joints, tattoo parlors were essential. Heck, in Michigan, gardens were non-essential. It was all about destroying traditional values.

                “tons of announcements and precious little accomplished.“
What are you talking about? Outside of the fringes, trust in gov’t, particularly the courts has been stubbornly remaining high. Trump is making a mockery of the “impartial” judiciary, judges are having to double down on stupid, and, at long last, people are seeing it.
In 2020, heck, even as recently as early 2024, it was still widely thought the Deep State was just a conspiracy theory believed by a few kooks in tin-foil hats. Now…

                Now hol’ on, here’s a verbatim comment from a substack. Trump may be on to bigger game, that is, the Reset of the global economy first, which empowers the connected Deep States of the Western world.Related to yesterday’s, and a bonus- this is from a stack bitchslapping an old enemy, Nathan Cofnas.Whitepill, incoming:The UK, Canada and EU threw everything they had the U.S. markets since Trump announced Liberation Day for the U.S. on April 2, 2025. They drove down stocks, bonds, gold and silver. It failed. And it also flushed out all the usual suspects who have been manipulating our markets for decades.When Trump announced the market was a buy on the morning of April 9, 2025, it also flushed out the American politicians who were short the market—Schiff, Schumer, Warren et al. Trump then increased tariffs on China, and started negotiating with the 70 countries willing to deal and imposed 10% tariffs on most of the countries. Huge win.As Big Tech stocks took it on the chin the next three trading days, in the last hour of trading on Friday the tech stocks mysteriously popped up a bit. The icing on the cake is that after the markets closed on Friday, Trump announced a pause on tariffs for tech, chips, etc. For the first time in 32 years, a president told the manipulators that two can play at this game, I have much more financial power than you, and have fun covering your tech shorts on Monday morning when the market opens.Trump has already won the tariff war, LIBOR is dead as of 3/31/2025, SOFR is under the control of the Federal Reserve, and thus the U.S. has control over the U.S. Treasury yield curve and which banks get favored SOFR rates with or without collateral. (Hint: U.S. banks and Italian, Greek and Hungarian banks get nice rates, no collateral needed; the French, Germans and Brits? Meh.)The EU and BOE have little liquidity and less collateral. Gold and silver rallied (good luck making deliveries, London!) and their currencies rallied, i.e., they were scrambling for pounds and euros thus making their exports prohibitively expensive. Ouch! The U.S. Treasury can re-finance the $8 trillion debt over the next few months that the traitor Yellen issued with short maturities. Mark Carney is going to strip the Canadian people of their wealth to try to save the BOE and ECB and the Davos globalists.The Orange Julius Caesar is winning big for America, and you hate it. …Why do you hate good news? Why do you hate winning so much?—https://librarianofcelaeno.substack.com/p/letters-from-a-stupid-american/commentsBonus bonus: Trump didn’t hide any of this. He told Joe Sixpack to jump in the pool and play too. There’s a youtube short about how Trump told us, using Robinhood and such for $1000 in far out-of-the-money calls on QQQ’s would’ve netted a possible $1.2 million in payout…and has anybody been looking at fotm calls on NVidia today?It’s a 90s Boomer mindset. Stop kvetching, jump in and play, it’s the American roughhouse! Go grab some!

                        I’m not sold on the “big wins” either, but I accept that the alternative was “big losses”. Even not losing a whole lot of ground is “winning”, relatively speaking.Meanwhile, gold was, what, $1200 a decade ago? $120 for a 1/10th ounce coin? A month worth of Starbucks. Two-ish of cable. Maybe 3 of your cell. I get that Gen Z missed out, sure, but Millennials or X? They had the chance to almost triple their money in a friggin’ decade! Boomers only had that one, singular chance, too. Mostly you were doing pretty damn good if you could just double your money in a decade, i.e., 7% RoI. Well, except for real estate or other heavily leveraged assets.But, c’mon, all this doomer crap is, well, crap.

Otherwise, why are you in the game? I’ll black pill when all is lost, not before.

                Good insight! Hadn’t thought about it in those terms, but that is the difference in entrepreneurs, too. The number of men who are willing to break even or even lose over 2, 5, 7 years, maybe a decade are swamped by those who can’t or won’t live below their means until the next paycheck.
That’s all short time horizon, isn’t it?

            As a Brit, there is indeed far more hope your side of the pond. The Brits are pathetic in their subservience and apathy. And don’t get me started on the Germans! However, while I would have shared your emotions a month ago, I now find them complacent. Trump 2.0 is morphing into Trump 1.0. Elon saving 150m bucks is fine – until you see that asshat Hesgeth blow a trillion on the armed forces. Trump could stop the Gaza genocide and Ukraine stuff in 24 hours by cutting funding and military intel. but he won’t do it. He’s doing a good job of smashing parts of the Deep state, but only the ephemeral parts. The REAL SoBs like the FBI, DoJ, upper echelons of the military, etc. are still fully intact. I agree it’s early days, but the red lights are starting to flash. If Trump doesn’t do the job he was elected to do, the USA will start to look a lot like Europe, or worse.

        The 95 OKC bombing revived Bill Clinton’s political fortunes. After Democrats lost the House for the time in 40 years, and Clinton being forced to admit in the SOTU that “the era of big government is over”, the national conversation instantly changed to shadowy militias and the Republicans who enabled them. It set the stage for the “Gingrich” government shutdown later that year, which was blamed on Congress despite the fact that it was Clinton who vetoed the budget. That, in turn, facilitated Clinton’s reelection the following year, defeating longtime Senate factotum Bob Dole.McVeigh did Clinton a solid. Just say’n.

            Hot on the heels of the Waco massacre, for which Clinton was taking a ton of political flak. Then – out of the blue – the OK City bombing, and now those evil militia are the true threat! Amazing timing. Like 9-11 happening not long after Wolfowitz’s Pearl Harbor speech to West Point.

            During the post-debate analysis, they determined that Dole said, “I agree with the president.” almost 46% of the time, nearly half. There were a number of people interviewed after the final debate in a town hall forum who all pretty much said the same thing, “Dole agreed with Clinton so often, why is he even running?” I have the utmost respect for Dole’s service during WW II, but he was a lousy candidate and that accounted for a lot.

        Yeah, if we never see actual well known government liars and traitors being tried and convicted, the fix is obviously in.  If they’re worried about what the demoncraps and leftard media are going to say (as if that’d be any freaking surprise) about these things, we really are screwed.  As one myself, I’m further sick of these old grey haired boomer goats chanting about their dammed social security, Medicare, being nice to illegal aliens, not rooting out government waste and fraud, etc, etc.  Maybe when they’re all gone, s*** can actually get done…

                    It’s why I don’t buy the standard 1946-64 Boomer range. Strauss and Howe were more on track with 1943-60 but I like to keep it simple and say that Boomers were born in the 1940’s-50’s. Look at the list of performers at Woodstock, a majority of whom were born in the early 1940’s. Does it really make sense to consider them of the Silent Generation?

Where I live, there were a few women maybe 40-ish, in addition, though it’s always hard to tell with women and their Clairol and Maybelliene, but definitely not a lot of the younger generations helping. In fact, most of them were gatekeeping.

            More pain is necessary for change. We will get Sulla or Caesar after a serious crisis. In this regard, Trump is a “radical Centrist”. Beyond the rhetoric, he is a guy still wedded to the System. I admire his courage, but he simply lacks the will to cross the Rubicon. Most of us here would, ahem, lack the restraint he has shown thus far had we endured what Trump has endured.

                Did anyone hear the leaked audio between Musk and Trump from the Oval Office, in which Musk is despairing over Tesla and its future (as well as his own?). Trump has to talk him off the ledge by saying, “it’ll all be fine, it’ll all come out in the wash, as they say,” like an uncle taking a late-night call from his nephew and wanting to get off the line as soon as he can.
Definitely not the warriors we need.

        The system is really too far gone and entrenched to save/reform. It works too well for the people in it.
Yes, everything is a scam. Z’s post reminded me of one by Simplicus about the new German tanks. genuine technical marvels that are great at parades but not at war. But since the purpose of the tanks were to make money for the German blob and for politicians to talk tough, making them good at war would have just gotten in the way.https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/bombshell-reports-german-weapons?utm_source=post-banner&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=posts-open-in-app&amp;triedRedirect=true

        I am positive that awareness of this kind of thing is a lot larger than it used to be. Which has implications for the legitimacy of the system. Less fraud and more force, I guess.Granted, not everyone is as aware of the mendacity (which seems too kind a word for it) as we are. A lot of people remain stupidly and/or willfully oblivious. I try not to overestimate how much our dissident view is becoming predominant. But even recognizing that, awareness of regime lawlessness is still growing. And growing. I’m not so much wondering whether the Trump admin will bring “justice” (it probably won’t), but more considering the implications of it not doing so. Because if it doesn’t, then nobody will, and people are aware of that. A lot of people.

            Yes. But amazingly, the legitimacy of the system has declined in direct proportion to the increase in people’s need for help from it and its size/power. It’s one thing for independent people to challenge a small illegitimate government. It’s quite another for broke, helpless people to challenge a huge beast.

                As the economy has shrank, and it has been for some time, we had a fork in the road.  Pain and economic restructuring or the government prints more money and creates fake jobs.  Which did we “decide” on?  Its funny, as the legitimacy of the government declines, they make more and more people dependent on it as a first line of defense in my opinion.

That’s the case now. It may have tamped down some, but it will get worse due to necessity. The police state apparatus that runs things will increase in power until the Banana Empire implodes, whenever that it.

        I always had a bit of contempt for the Chinese and their obsession about ‘face’. They would rather eat a mile of shite then admit they were wrong. I see this now with Federal Law Enforcement. It’s not out of pride however. Local PD, county sheriffs, state police, the Feds. None will admit guilt. It’s the Gretchen Whitmer defense. If I can’t see you, you cannot see me and therefore anything that happens in this mutual darkness cannot be held to account. If I do not admit guilt, therefore I am guiltless and am beyond reproach.

        Day two of our host’s Holy Week of Doom…
I struggle with my faith.  I’ve lost family and friends.  I see a future for my children and legions of unborn grandchildren which will be much, much harder than anything I have had to endure.
Yet, this is Holy Week (all Christians agree on that this year).
Our trials and tribulations are ephemeral.  Our souls belong to a loving and just God and shall endure long past the flesh we are walking around in.

        Tucker’s latest interview with former congressman and 911 information guy Curt Wheldon is timely to this. Everyone should watch for more incisive examination and history of how effed we all are by the powerful  lying and treasonous deep state we have.

            Tucker complains about symptoms of (i) human nature and (ii) an empire of lies established through lies and brutality. He’s a useful pressure relief valve. The way out begins mentally and emotionally by rejecting the USA entirely. Meanwhile learn to breathe through the nose, not the mouth like most of the Columbians, esp. the Caucasians and Slavs. Cultivate awareness of respiration. No meteor is needed, and no deity will help.

        The FBI needs to be completely dismantled and every single employee, past or present, barred from working in any law enforcement agency or contractor anywhere in the country.Corruption is from people, not abstractions like “FBI” or some other agency.  The examples we all know are not isolated incidents.  If they were isolated, everyone would be afraid of exposing their willingness to do corrupt things to other agents.  This kind of corruption can only exist in a culture of corruption where corruption is normal and not out of the ordinary.Any agency that would replace the FBI would have to rules to prevent the corruption.  First thing I can think of is forcing the new agency to record all interviews both audio and video.  Right now, they will not allow themselves to be recorded under any circumstances and it is crime to record them without their knowledge.  They take 50 pages of scribbled notes and then force you to sign it under penalty of perjury.  Martha Stewart can tell you all about it.

        Given what has been revealed just in the last ten years, the political class should be united in their desire to disband the FBI. There is no appetite for even mild reforms, as we see happening now.It isn’t a matter of “won’t.” It is a matter of “can’t.” It doesn’t matter whether the public face of the government wants to disband the FBI. The Help and Ho’s in Congress and the White House can’t dissolve the secret police. The US is run by a massive police state apparatus, and any attempt to change the situation will cause unmanageable resistance and possible death for the wannabe-reformers. The difference between the FBI/other federal police agencies and the KGB and the Gestapo of old is the latter two did not seek the elimination of their nations’ historic populations. This is the primary mission of today’s police state.The only possible reform, if that even is how to describe it, will happen with the collapse of the Banana Empire, whenever that occurs. The United States is the most lawless, evil empire in world history. There is nothing the people put forward in elections can do to change the situation, even the few who would.

        One of the more disturbing aspect of the Oklahoma City bombing is that some group in the FBI helped blow up a Federal office building. They killed fellow members of the blob and no one in the blob cared enough to blow the whistle on them?  Murdering people they despise like Randy Weaver’s wife and the Waco group are bad enough, but this is incredibly diabolical. Even the mob had a code.

        As I recall, the actual targets of the OK City bomb (the BATF guys) just happened to be out of the office that day. I was puzzled at the time as to why anybody would set off a bomb in the daytime, with the place loaded with civilians. A night time bomb would have destroyed the building and the BATF offices with no or minimal civilian casualties. Once you read up on the actual details of the matter, you get the same fetid odor that the details of 9-11 create. The official story is BS.

        When the OKC bombing happened I couldn’t believe that it was a govt. set-up. My cynicism was growing even then, yet I remained incredibly naive. But I still was not able to accept the wilder “conspiracy theories” about “what really happened.” Now I do accept those things. Or at least I accept the U.S. government is capable of such things.As far as believing that so many people could be complicit in such a horrendous act, there are ways the intel comm operates so as to limit understanding in such matters, to limit blowback and to repair damage to loyalty structures or squelch concerns after the fact. But to address the more specific criticisms, those near the tip of the spear operate on strict need-to-know rules. They are fed a manufactured reality to keep them in the dark as to their mission. After the dust settles those who complain are either threatened or permanently silenced if they become too pushy, it’s that simple. Over all, the sentiment that it’s for the “good of the cause” permeates all thinking esp. at the top levels. This atmosphere creates many suicides, many wrecked lives, many broken souls. Who would want to spend one’s life in such a system? Well, only the worst rise to the top in such a system so — as a people — we get what we deserve let’s not lie to ourselves.

            It was at least plausible. Crime, particularly among blacks, had been coming down over the decades. For whatever reason, NYC crime plummeted under Giuliani. It does not seem far-fetched that people respond to incentives, particularly since pretty much the entire animal kingdom does.
Where conservatism really screwed the pooch was in accepting that the reigning incentive structure by the mid 2000s (especially compassionate conservatism and magic dirt and magic negros) had anything to do with the earlier incentive structures.

                Giuliani subscribed to the sociological theory of “broken window”. Basically, he enforced penalties for “minor” crimes such as “turnstile jumping” to avoid fares, public drinking, and he used stop and frisk” vigorously to get firearms off the street.  This got those budding criminals into the system as quickly as possible, and when they were caught doing violent crime, their criminal history was such that it indicated incarceration rather than parole.  It worked.  Gang members took to leaving their guns at home due to random stop and frisk for example.Heck, when I was there during Giuliani’s tenure, you could go into a train station and along the wall was a built-in cage to lock up the turnstile jumpers caught.  There were just too many to immediately transport to jail, so they’d fill the cage and then call for transport.Works for me….

        “Under Obama, the FBI helped sell weapons to the Mexican drug cartels, who used those weapons to kill Americans.”Minor quibble here, but it continues to come up regularly in my readings.Elaboration.Operation Fast and Furiouswas part of a broader ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) program calledProject Gunrunner.  Project Gunrunner began during the George W. Bush administration in 2006, aiming to stop illegal gun trafficking to Mexican cartels by tracing weapons back to buyers and suppliers. But Operation Fast and Furious, the most controversial part of that effort, was specifically launched under the Obama administration in late 2009.Point?  Both admin’s were involved in this effort, and it did not begin under Obama.  This I know by being somewhat of a “gunny” myself and personally knowing those dealers here who were contacted by the ATF and were told to *allow* such purchases as part of their “investigation”.  These saleswere“caught” or flagged if you will via the process then—and still—in effect to counter such.  The legal firearms dealers were caught up in this operation and forced to *illegally* sell firearms to those who would smuggle them.Obama, two-faced as all Dem’s, was forcing illegal sales while simultaneously ordering ATF to audit and revoke firearm dealer licenses.  Basically, there were 10’s of thousands of licensed dealers who operated from home.  Their sales were minor and mostly of convenience to themselves for personal purchases.  I know several of these. ATF agents basically were told to “shut down” all non brick and mortar (home) vendors.  It worked quite well.Currently the Mexican government is suing US manufactures for sales forced by the ATF on their vendors.  Of course, the American anti-gun lobby loves this as it makes the business of manufacturing and selling firearms just that much more expensive and gives them yet another chance to bankrupt manufacturers through lawfare and therefore dry up public supply.

        I see the comments about blackpilling. I don’t see it that way. I think we have to do what we can to push for and encourage reforms and to push harder when they are not far enough in our direction. That is really the best we can do in terms of the system, unless we have a huge number of insiders that we are not aware of.What is important is to be realistic and try to understand as best we can likely outcomes. In the end, Trump in there doing what he is doing is a far more positive situation even if he fails. At the least it causes the legitimacy of the system to wane even faster. The attacks on the patronage networks has shown benefits. I wish they were doing it much more organized in terms of a systematic from-the-White-House direct information campaign. I wish they were naming names and going even deeper into the networks.This is about will. Do the leaders of the counter revolution have the will to go as far and as hard as is needed? That comes down to belief. Do they believe they must do this and that some other system or arrangement must be erected? Probably not. They are children of winter and thoroughly bought into the sacraments as man as an economic unit and using prosperity as the sole means of “unifying” a “people”. Rather, they create happiness by preventing as much privation and creating as much prosperity as possible. That is their ethos. It is entrenched in every fiber of their being. None buys it more than the, we-are-all-organistic-meat-sacks, ethos of Musk. They aren’t bad people. They just haven’t been near the bottom to have their world view shattered whereas we have.This means that every reform they make is really just trying to re-assemble the very system and ethos that led to its breaking. American liberal democracy Managerialism is the problem and the best of them are well intended managers. The problem is, they are not citizens or a part of a people in a deep and meaningful sense.Our job is not to whine but to deepen and strengthen our ties to each other and do it by being there for each other as the central force succumbs to centrifugal forces, sometimes slowly sometimes quickly. Thank God Trump is in there and not Harris. Use the time wisely and pray for Vance in ’28. He isn’t ideal but the alternative must be avoided at all costs. In the meantime, build.

            Yes, great comment. I do think the blackpilling over the pace of reforms, or feints that way, indicates why they usually lead to collapse or other throws or simply don’t work. By the time of attempts at reform, things have deteriorated so badly generally nothing can be done in a timely enough way. The accelerated looting indicates our tormentors think it is drawing to a close.

Yes. This is a blind spot with Trump and the political elite. Few or none from the working class, and none who actually have been homeless, impoverished, etc.
It puts the bark on you or you don’t survive.
While those who rule over us live in whitewashed bubble-worlds. Ivy-League prep academies before taking vows to Harvard and Columbia.  I can know Donald Trump, but he cannot know me.

        When I was young and ignorant, I was a patriotic, flag-waving American who believed while there were often bad actors, the system itself was good. As I started to learn, the bad actors are there because the system is rotten to the core.Reminds me of a story about a Taco Bell that was so overrun with vermin that it was better that the company tear the building down and start anew. I think we’re at this point now. I don’t think you can reform something so corrupt.The FBI had a purpose in the Bonnie and Clyde days as violent gangs used jurisdictional issues to flee law enforcement, but now, it’s one of those self-licking ice cream cones that make its own work. Whenever I see a story about the FBI busting a plot here or there, my first thought is “how dumb are the poor bastards they entrapped online.”

            “The FBI had a purpose in the Bonnie and Clyde days”True, and it’s basically the same purpose for every police department, including those departments found in bootlicker territories. That purpose is to drain away motive and enthusiasm for private, unpaid action by men and older boys. Some people are keen to subvert social capital, and to prevent its buildup where there is little.There’s also another morbid fear, esp. among fags, females, financiers, Phonecians, and the friends of Zion. An empire of bourgeois indulgence and atomist collectivism won’t remain this way for long if numerous men—always the primary source of ascetical movements—lose their appetites for excess, much less if they lose their loyalty to secularism.

                Just to be clear, there are other necessary conditions for such an empire to be subverted by men who lose their faith in secularism: They must get to know each other. They must form a meeting of the minds, so that there can be harmony among the them. They must learn how to coöperate like members of a winning team, or teams. They must act.Fyi, believing on some powerful god is not necessary, nor is it a sufficient condition of losing faith in secularism. A faithful theistic priest, for instance, who drinks and enjoys feasts and watches sports with the boys is a secularist.

        America has been cryptocratic at least since the JFK hit, and likely back to J. Edgar Hoover(men).  Intel has stage-managed Hollywood and the media since forever.Careful study of John Kennedy’s archaic-style ritual assassination makes clear that the U.S. government is in the hands of intel operatives, not politicians.  Skull-and-Bones (Bush Sr., Bush Jr., John Kerry etc.) WAS the CIA, back in the old days of Dulles Bros. Enterprises.  Power at intel and Atlantic old money often intersect.Not unrelated, JFK promised to annihilate the CIA just before he abruptly departed the planet.  That was the real coup, and the woke-fem Left direction taken by America since ’63 reveals intel still in charge and the war still religious.

        Government doesn’t get much help from the Gospels. Don’t resist evil. Don’t fret about tomorrow. Trust your Father in heaven. The truth will make you free. He who takes up the sword will die by the sword. This is not advice our own Caesars are apt to take.


Jesus did exalt the publican, or tax collector, who prayed, “Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner.” Today’s publicans, of course, are called “public servants,” and they deny any wrongdoing. Or they have their lawyers deny it for them. Maybe they also let their lawyers handle their carefully worded orisons.

Obviously false. Shromans 13:1-2.

            I need to look up Vizzini’s biblical passage from yesterday.  If that doesn’t prove the Bible is a political tome, I don’t know what does.  I’d like to know the chapter/verses.
p.s.  I just realized what Christianity teaches:  Stoicism.
A grounded Greek philosophy, not the Talmud’s scheming to get around the rules nor the Kabbalah’s alchemical sex-magic.

        I followed the closest thing we had to alt media back at the time of the OKC bombing.it was clear that the BATF and FBI were both had informants galore at a place called Eholhim city in oklahoma where there was a groum of badthinkers living . their bungling and infighting let mcVeigh get the material to do the job. He did it to avenge Ruby Ridge and the Waco massacre.Strangly enough , the feds dialed back the we’ll shoot and burn your kids program after it happened .

        I can get behind the fbi baiting people, and then swooping in to save the day or whatever. I’m still having trouble believing that thousands or even only hundreds of men and women planned and executed mass murder of children and innocents. It would imply an entire class of people are sociopaths. To plan and execute the murder of children is an act so extreme not many people are psychologically strong enough to do it. Now Gaza is different . There is a spiritual element behind those people that give them religious (demonic) internal psychological cover.maybe I’m naive but it just seems like a misreading of human nature to think that 50k men and women lightly and casually planned  murder of who they thought were their fellow citizens even if they thought them better than those others by their position.I don’t know. I guess it’s not such a far step from Dresden to Oklahoma city if you begin to be so cut off from your own people that you see them as the enemy. It’s just that no one denied bombing Germany. There was an announcement of “enemy” and a mindset of “enemy” that I just don’t see transferring to the twin towers of the Murray federal building.but I could be wrong . End times perhaps

            If the allies had lost WW2, they would have been put on trial for war crimes, just like the axis players.  Robert Mcnamara admitted as much in the documentary The Fog of War (great watch by the way) he also insinuated other sinister going ons that he couldn’t talk about at the end.

                Yes!  Fog of War is indeed a great documentary if for nothing else seeing one of the main architects of a major war gone bad present a mea culpa near the end of his life.  Can anyone imagine that happening now?Also, I think your line about the allies being tried for war crimes if they had lost was actually attributed to Curtis LeMay who commanded the carpet bombing of German cities and even small towns     resulting in the wholesale slaughter of hundreds of thousands of German civilians at a time when the war was essentially over.  No slow-death torture chamber would’ve been too brutal for him IMO.

                    When they ran out of cities to bomb, they started machine gunning individual Germans walking along roads. Chuck Yeager was a fighter pilot at the time and when he saw this stuff going on, he commented that “we’d better win this war” (or we would be the ones in the dock).

                    A look at where pre-war architecture survives in Tokyo (Imperial Palace, Kasumigaseki, Hibiya, Ginza, etc.) makes it clear that the intent was always to BBQ civilians and leave a surviving government/elite superstructure to negotiate with.

            a link to the trailer:https://youtu.be/VgA98V1Ubk8Another good documentory to watch is the act of killing, here is a trailer for thathttps://youtu.be/n_cXCOBcH5cIt is about the killing fields in Indonesia, interviews people who actually took part.  My takeaway is that under pressure most people can be convinced to do anything (they don’t believe in anything really and just go along with whatever they believe is popular).  Think about it with regards to covid, half the country wanted to lock up people and remove them from society for refusing to take an untested concoction from an industry with a proven track record of shitty products.  All because the TV and thought leaders told them that.

                There’s something about traditional Asian societies with strong normative codes of politeness and decorum when they finally lose their shit: when they go they really go to town.
What’s really infesting is that per-capita the supposedly gentle and otherworldly Balinese were the most bloodthirsty during that period of cathartic violence. And in Java itself, it was the supposedly less fanatical more syncretic Abangan Muslims of East Java who killed the most.

It would imply an entire class of people are sociopaths.It’s hard to believe because you’re not an evil/insane person.  I suggest reading up on MKUltra – even the ‘mainstream’ stuff will curl your hair.  The feds involved were doing stuff even to each other – co-workers.  Then read as much as you can stomach from Gulag Archipelago.  Then about the US willfully starving Germans to death after WW2.  Or how American GIs raped their way across France and Germany while “liberating” them.  The ability of FedGov to turn men into monsters is quite remarkable.For me the last straw was Tower 7 and the inescapable implications.  I’ve been fairly cynical my adult life, but I wasn’t anywhere near cynical enough.  Now I’m getting closer, but I’m sure many more horrific revelations lay ahead.

        Soon after the bombing, PBS show Nightline provided a timeline or something they called a McVeigh chronology of the events that happened with the bombing in Kansas City. You can read the timeline and see over a period of days, different witnesses at different locations on different times and dates testified that they saw McVeigh in the company of men that were described at the time as looking dark skinned Mexican, Hawaiian, or Middle Eastern. There has been no identification of any of these men. Also all of the body parts that were found at the bomb site were identified and matched up with other body parts and bodies, except for a leg that, even after DNA testin,g no one has been able to determine who it belonged to and it was found near Ground Zero of the blast site.Here is a link to PBS Nightline chronology for the Kansas City bombing with McVeighhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/documents/mcveigh/mcveigh3.html

        “Anything damaging to the government was destroyed long ago”That habit is why it’s so important not to become ensnared by debates about particulars (who shot JFK? did McVeigh do it? etc.) but to call attention also to shady origins of the USA and her obviously fake “supreme Law of the Land”. Nobody at CNN wants to black pill the public with a reminder of the skulduggery of 1775 through 1789. Yet some important material has to be kept in plain sight, which makes it vulnerable to skepticism.The DoI is a dogpile of creationist, “Englightenment” agitprop. The Constitution begins with a big lie and pretends in Article VII that part of it is law before its own ratification and establishment. Well, faith in that stuff must be attacked regularly. Without widespread blind faith in the founding myths and documents, this mendacious Novus Ordo Seclorum must crumble. Then also the capitalist globohomo system.“There are 38,000 people employed by the FBIand most of them are probably on social media trying to bait people into going along with a plot that the FBI can then solve.”There are legions of resume builders among those 38,000. (If you help one on a project, you can get a participation medal as your reward, like a roommate of mine once did.) Therein lies much of the motive for entrapment. Such people, if they are allowed bureaucracies in which to flourish, will be troublemakers in any type of system, including systems which follow the demise the USA and her so-called “States”, which are just provinces.It’s btw that many of the provinces have unnatural frontiers, and all lack a healthy common culture to hold their inhabitants together. Jesus, having been just another failed wannabe mashiach, won’t be any help here. We are in deep trouble, and clinging emotionally to habit and tradition is not the answer.
