        For today’s outside reading assignment, I recommend:https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/american-exodus-angelo-codevilla-oligarchyThe passing (tragically unexpected) of the author of this piece is a profoundly unhelpful occurrence.  A great voice from our side of the political/social chasm has been lost.

        It is easy to see that America has a culture problem, but it is not what people think of when they hear the term. It is much deeper than the bourgeois degeneracy we see in the mass media. It is the structure of the ruling class.It’s a lot worse than that.As you allude to it goes back to the beginning.People immigrated to the US for one of two reasons.Religious zealots came here to build their heaven on earth.And everyone else came here to get rich and quick.Those two founding cultures have reverberated through the centuries. With the zealots pushing one damn thing or another until the exhausted themselves and went into hibernation for a while.   And everyone ignored them as much as possible and kept focusing on grabbing stuff and getting rich with little thought for the future.

        One of the corollary disadvantages of freelancing your way into the future is that confirmation bias always paints an overly rosy picture, e.g. never-ending goods &amp; services for as far as the eye can see. In addition, the Comfort First Imperative prevents everyone from ever imagining just how bad things might get in a worst case scenario, e.g. the social safety net is perceived as being not only super reliable but a pretty cushy high bottom if you happen to hit it. We’ve reached the stage where whistling-past-the-graveyard is the default response to every problem.And yet, a collapse is desperately needed, and it needs to hurt and hurt pretty bad. Nature mandates regular culling in order to maintain the health of the forest. Human affairs are no different. And every other remedy is just a poor attempt at slowing the roll into the ditch before veering off the cliff.

                Joe Normie lives in a nice 4 bedroom, 3 bath suburban home, 2 autos (SUV for the misses), 54 inch flat screen TV with surround sound, bass boat, 2 kids, and a dog. He earns low 6 figures, has a 401k, golfs several times a month, and spends about $5k each year on the family vacation, He simply cannot allow himself to believe that it could all evaporate in the span of a few weeks, He desperately needs to believe in voting harder because he knows that he would be utterly worthless to his family in a truly chaotic collapse scenario. And that thought is too much to bear.

I’m telling you, that steadfast refusal to ponder the imponderable is a failure of an existential darwinian sh!t-test.
It absolutely boggles my mind that in this day &amp; age, ostensible adults could live as psychological ostriches with their heads thrust so deep into the sand of The Narrative that they won’t even realize when their necks have been machete’ed.
tl;dr = Chicken Little got a bad rap.

            Eschatologically we all start and end up in the same place, alive then not alive.
Politically we all started out around the same edenic place. Young, immature, trusting, naive, gullible, patriotic. Now we find ourselves in a distant place. Mature, cynical, aware. Enlightenment.
When you reach enlightenment, that level of awareness, knowledge of good &amp; evil, after having progressed at your own pace, that is when you begin to prepare. Prepare now. A reckoning is coming. Talking, writing, voting, hoping won’t fix things. We are leaderless. We have no Pericles. Make like the squirrel, collect acorns.

        “Some problems don’t have a solution”.  Does anyone believe enough Caucasians are going to move back to Chicago to elect white leadership again?  Detroit?  At first I couldn’t understand how George Floyd and Michael Brown could become cultural icons.   But speaking of culture, I finally realized these thugs are perfectly appropriate cultural icons of the 13%.

            Actually, Detroit finally wised up and elected a white dude who was a former prosecutor to the mayorship.
He, and the chief of police there, were the main reasons there wasn’t much BLM activity in Detroit last summer.

“Women who are active in church” sounds like a nightmare. Paul himself warned about such a thing. What would happen is that the church would, sooner or later, have lesbian priests and bishops.
And how many times have we seen this exact thing?

            “And how many times have we seen this exact thing?”I like John Knox’s 1550 or so “First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women”, preceded by 1800 years or so by Aristophanes’ Ecclesiazusae.

        “Their understanding of reality is rooted in a world that no longer exists.”
A blinding statement of the obvious, but this is true to the 1000th power for the “conservative movement” with its worship of Lincoln and “equality” which invariably reduces humanity to an anthill of indistinguishable ants — who, however, each possess their Lockean natural rights. You simply cannot talk to or reason with those people. Their brains are imprisoned by Enlightenment anthropological and teleological fantasies.  Perhaps they’ll get some Afghan neighbors. That might provide a wake-up but then again, probably not.

            Even their picture of an anthill is wrong.  If you want the ultimate in classism and racism, look to the ants.

        I agree with everything here.  And the degeneracy is a feature not a bug.   It’s going to be quite something when this crisis does hit.  One thing I’ve noticed with the older crowd, mostly recent retirees, is that regardless of politics, and regardless of education level, from top to bottom, they’re not even hard wired to conceive of a Soviet like failure of the country.  If you find an old person who cares about this they’re quite an outlier and probably a dissident.  The younger you get, the less shocked everyone will be.  I’ve had many conversations with these people, both in their last five years before retirement (they think) and recently retired.  I know an 85 year old woman whose all in the Nasdaq.  Almost universally, when I bring up the structural problems I’m a “downer” and hear “they’ve been saying this since the 80’s.”  I don’t get upset over it anymore.  It is what it is.  I just never considered that the people with the most to lose financially, with no hope of earning their way back,  would be the most blind to reality that’s coming like a freight train.

                    They would probably ask who we lost a war against, or who we got invaded by. It looks like we got invaded by India, here anyways. In California it might appear as if it was invaded by China or Mexico.
In a way we did, but it wasn’t by the typical war mechanisms. More like subversion from within, as well as spiritual weakness caused by prosperity.
The true invasions and wars haven’t even started yet.

            I’ve noticed the total inability to grok a Soviet-style failure of the US among the Silent and Boomer generations.
I was shooting the shit with a typical Boomer at a bar a few weeks ago, and we dipped our toe into the political waters a bit.
His main point was, “Maaan, in the ’60s we all used to work together!”
I was on vacation, so I didn’t bring up the demographics of the US then versus now.

                Lol, in the ’60s people worked together the way Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn and Cathy Boudin worked together to murder people and blow them up! The murder victims did their cooperative part by dying. Teamwork!

            When you hit 75 the brain usually gets a little less plasticBeyond that nothing much matters since you could die of the usual things for any reason at any time.Also the Boomers in particular caveat the Vietnam veterans really mostly had easy lives and have serious normalcy bias.There are exceptions but as you noted   its only outliers, dissidents and outlaws.,As a generation the Boomers don’t matter much any way. If things get bad, we’ll gladly accept the help  of the clued in ones but the generations day is done and its not their fight now. Its ours.

            People with a big fat wad in their 401K or IRAs are the most blind. They think the party will never end. See they were fed a massive lie by the MSM and Wall Street since the 80’s that the stock Market will go up forever. And those who embraced it back then made out like bandits.So with 40 years of market growth they cannot conceive of a bad ending.BTW they are also oblivious to the massive collapse of society and the country being invaded by human cockroaches. IOW they don’t notice all the ‘tells’ that the party bus is ready to go off the cliff.

        Everybody is living in the past.I keep seeing white liberals complaining about how “drivers are so bad these days! i keep almost getting hit on my bike!” or “wow, how can men be rapists? just don’t rape, ok”. As if it’s white bread, normal guys parking in the bike lane and drugging women for date rape. They don’t seem to be capable of distinguishing between “our” people and “other” people. They’re living in the summer of love and there’s only poor black people and white oppressors.Conservatives keep blaming “urban libtards” for voting leftist. There are some of those people, sure. But San Francisco is only 39% white. NYC is 30% “white”, mostly Jewish. It’s not “white people” voting for any mayor in any major urban center anymore. Trump probably was cheated out of the election. Other than the Trump aberration it’s now demographically impossible for anybody “conservative” to win federally, because “conservative” IS “white”.The ruling class is quite naive. For instance, all the well meaning white libs who get attacked by AOC and Omar. Turns out the anti white POC hate white liberals (this includes Jews) just as much as they hate those mean racist whites. They probably hate white liberals more because they sense weakness and will attack a weaker enemy first. The ruling class also thinks that Brazil can win a war against China.

                We’ve hit the Catch-22. Racing is safer (or at least a driver will have a longer career with less change of death), but innovation has been legislated out of the sport. As with IndyCar, the days of a front-wheel drive, all-wheel drive, jet powered, Turbo 4 cylinder, Turbo 8 cylinder idea from out of the blue showing up to compete, maybe failing, maybe winning, but at least pissing off other teams is long gone.

                    The increasing money to be had in high-level racing (beginning in the second half of the 60s) meant that specs had to be put into place to try to prevent the richest owners/teams from dominating totally. But with specs, and admittedly, more competitive racing, came a numbing sameness, and, as you say, a lack of innovation. And that goes for drivers, too, corporate shills selected for willingness to never say anything taboo rather than for their talent. Then again, when the cars effectively drive themselves, talent is unnecessary. You sure don’t have to be  Jim Clark or AJ Foyt to succeed in F1 and Indy Car these days.

        “It is why the system violently vomited up Donald Trump and continues to dry heave over the memory of him.”Good one! It was the dry heaving that made the joke!But seriously, this is a great point about why the vast system (govement, media, etc) is so out of touch. They are in operating on an outdated system.Its interesting thinking about whether our problems are the products of a small group of brilliant, and psychologically advanced megalomaniacs, and incompetence. I do think there are people that hate whites and work toward our destruction, but its hard to believe they are like the gods of the past adn we are just at their mercy. No, I think there is a system that just keeps running and the people in it can’t conceive of anything different!

        Holy smokin’ smokes.  I found a real life example of dangerous fossilized culture, right here, late yesterday’s comments.  This. Means. War.The Tale of Vizzini’s Daughter:“So, my daughter’s religious exemption at her hospital has been given it’s final denial and she’s on her way out. However, she also related to me very shocking story.A fellow tech has a variety of medical issues that make her ineligible for the vaccine, yet she was denied a medical exemption. Wait, it gets worse. The girl felt trapped. She couldn’t afford to give up her job, so she went to get the vaccine there at the hospital. When they pulled up her medical records, they refused to give her the vax — she was clearly prohibited from it by clear language in the vaccine risks and restrictions.But they still wouldn’t grant her exemption. They told her she just had to go get the vaccine elsewhere. So she went and got it at Walgreens, where they don’t give a damn about your actual medical risks.Let me reemphasize that — the hospital insisted that if she wanted to keep her job she had to get a vaccine that the hospital itself thought was too risky to give her.My daughter says the tech isn’t particularly bright or forceful or brave and let herself be browbeat into it.This is way beyond simply stupid. This sort of coercion of the weak is straight-up evil. Like, actually demonic, Satanic evil.***Because she’s going to stand up for what she believes in and not hide it.It hass caused a lot of good conversations around the hospital, opened some eyes.If nobody’s willing to stand up and say “I’m Spartacus” nothing ever happens.***We’re not going to lawyer our way out of this any more than we’re going to vote our way out of it.***Just found out that every religious exemption at her hospital was denied … except the Muslim.”

            I have a good friend who was offered a gig with AT&amp;T yesterday.  The pay is quite good but they’re mandating a jab.  He just had a bout of the Wuhan flu in August so there’s no need at all for it, but the only exceptions they’re granting are religion-based.  Of course we know those are a farce as they’ll just pick apart his case until he has no choice left.  He’s shown me the questions on the exception form and they’re all open to follow up questions along the lines of “If this is a concern of yours, why didn’t you do or not do X, Y, and Z in the past?”  I’ve told him that, joking or not, his only hope is to say he’s a recent convert to Islam and that his mosque has to remain secretive because it allows homosexuals, trannies, and women to worship together.  The other interesting bit about it is that should his somehow miraculously get his exemption they’re going to pay him less, to the tune of $4 an hour.  Not that it matters with the state of the judiciary, but surely that’s can’t be legal, can it?

                As an aside, the Bishop of our Catholic diocese recently instructed priests to *not* sign off on religious exemptions to the Covid vaccine as there were none under Catholic teaching.

                        The current Pope is openly an antichrist and as said so himself.
Given the dire conditions in the church  , just revert to Matthew 18:20
Maybe someday a new church can be formed. A true Catholic Church even with the inevitable corruption  could become the greatest source of good in the world. Well so long as they actually understood and heeded the Bible anyway.

                vivabarneslaw dot locals doc com has a free sample religious exemption request letter authored by Attorney Robert Barnes, well known for fighting mandates and other injustices. He also offers free advice in his livestreams sometimes about the religious exemption. Just my opinion but from his livestreams he would probably tell your friend that the company has zero right to question your friend about the legitimacy of his “faith” in any way, they are not his pastor, etc. They may keep bluffing, but your friend should win if the company is stubborn enough even to go to court. And Barnes has said docking part of an unvaxxed worker’s pay is a no-go in his opinion either. He’s supposed to have a livestream tonight at 7pm est., but there’s always a replay. You can watch and see the questions if you join for free but you have to be a contributor to ask questions.

                All he needed to do is walk into the interview wearing a Muslim beanie and carrying a Koran..It would also help if he knew some Islamic greetings, etc. to help make him look legit.
Then he could tell the ATT goon that his Iman  forbades the jab at this time.
No white boss is going to contradict him because of what HR will do to him. A lot of companies are just terrified of offending Muslims because they know the EEOC and other groups will come down on them like a ton of bricks.

        I’m reminded of the “jump to conclusions” guy fromOffice Space,explaining to the Two Bobs that he takes the specs from the customer and delivers them to the engineers, he’s a people person, damn it, why the hell can’t you see that?!?One thing I noticed in my time in the corporate salt mines — which, admittedly, was a long time ago — was that “management” really is a people job… but because of stuff like Affirmative Action, “managers” have to prove that they, you know, actually DO stuff, so they’re forced to quantify it. A good manager really doesn’t actually DO all that much, because if they’re any good, they’re on top of what’s going on with the people under them. They only have to act at their level of authority, which is in one of those crises.To switch metaphors for a second, the  company commander isn’t out there doing rifle inspections and checking for trench foot, because that’s a corporal’s job… and if there’s a problem with that, it’s the sergeant’s job, and if there’s a problem withthat,it’s the lieutenant’s job. The company commander shouldknowthat there’s a lot of trench foot in 3rd platoon, but he shouldn’t be out there pulling guys’ boots off. His job is to figure out who in the group isn’t pulling their weight, and why, then let the nearest level of authority implement the solution.Throw AA into the mix with the entropy that affects any big organization, and pretty soon you’ve got COs out there pulling guys’ boots off, because how else are they going to generate the paperwork necessary to prove to the Diversity bureaucracy that they’re actually doing something? And since this quickly becomes the fastest route to promotion, now you’ve got quite senior management out there standing over line workers’ shoulders, “supervising,” because that’s the only thing that generates paper.Forget immanentizing the eschaton. If we could get back to “not attempting to quantify the qualitative,” we’d go a long way towards solving a lot of problems.

            Reminds me of Qualtrics, that Google property that provides surveys to quantify the qualitative and does meta analysis on the surveys themselves. E.g., “it took customers on average five more seconds to answer question 4 than question 3.” These days any interaction with any level of a corporation might result in one of these surveys landing in your inbox. Are the results actually useful for the company? Perhaps the real purpose is to “generate papers” for the manager who ordered them.

                For 90% of processes these days, the only point of the process is to measure compliance with the process. Z Man did a bit on it a while ago, but I remember in my time the fad was TQM — Total Quality Management. I went to all the meetings, got all the training, and all I could conclude at the end of it was TQM means “do exactly what you were doing before, but document the shit out of every single thing, and then measure the amount of documentation, such that you can document the documentation.” Those managers whose department were most in line with the ever-evolving “standards” — based on the documentation of the documentation, of course — “won” that quarter.

                    TQM — Total Quality Management.I remember that. I worked at a credit card company back then, and everybody in my department knew what our biggest problem was  – credit cards were embossed with the name on the contract, not the name that the customer wanted on his card, i.e. “Ebenezer Prudentia Jones” rather than “E.P. Jones.”And everybody knew how to fix it, a simple and obvious change of procedure for the keyboard coolies, one that we’d been pressing for six months to no avail.It took us two hours to get to the nub of the problem, because the Karen that ran the show insisted on dragging us through the whole gamut point-by-point of “identifying the problem”, “come up with possible solutions” and “debate every suggestion” and “identify the best solution.”First thing, some guy told her what the problem was and how to fix it in two sentences and can we please go back to work now? He was told to STFU until we got to the “identifying the solution”-item on her agenda.The problem is that a lot of people love this shit, and not just the jerks who run it either. For Karen-types such marathon meetings are mother’s milk.

        I’ve been aware for some time now that we are stultifying, smart phones are not really innovating, just adding more pretty apps, we actually haven’t made any great strides in EXPLORING space, just marking time with the same old same old, American ingenuity and innovation on any meaningful level is so hamstrung by rules, permits, patent infringement (beat the innovator to the patent office or steal it, buy them out and sit on the patent), no innovative solutions to housing because the county and city planning and zoning departments are all staffed by either good ole boys who won’t make a move unless they get their cut, or by vibrant do nothing hires exercising petty tyranny. Even medical innovations are ruled by the “how much money can we make” attitudes. I think it will take a crushing blow to us in the form of a major die off of the powers that be, so that new ideas and inventions can rise up like “Renaissance” seeds in the fields after the black plague has killed 2/3 of the populations.

            This. Especially in re: the medical bureaucracy. India has their covid thing essentially beat thanks to the pioneering work of that famous Dutch microbiologist, Eye VerMecten. But that doesn’t make any money for Big Pharma, so… how many “boosters” are we up to now? Five?What a wonderfully, amazingly stupid time to be alive. If you’re amused by suicidal human folly, as I am, you’re constantly at risk of developing a hernia from all the gut-busting laughter. Hey, remember whenthe Leftwas always going on and on about how Big Pharma never cures anything, because if they find a cure then their stock price drops and those eeeevil capitalists would never tolerate that? I swear, it happened. I was hearing about it on Jan 19, 2021, in fact… but now they’re all standing in line to get their sixth “booster” shot. Hilarious.

                Well, they’re certainly conflicted—even now on “big” pharma.  Everyone needs a shot, they are our salvation, perfectly safe and efficacious…yada, yada.
Yet, in another presentation, Biden talks about legislation to reign in drug prices and make pharmaceuticals “affordable” to people.  Legislation now in Congress regarding mandated generics and purchasing/reimport into from other countries.

                    The AW Left is transitioning from socialism to the free market, but still has one foot in the former camp. And for many of them, particularly their Boomers, the transition is very painful. It’s not easy to jettison what you’ve believed all of your life and to adopt what you’ve always vilified.
The DR, interestingly enough, is composed of former conservatives who’ve become deeply skeptical of capitalism, and while hardly socialists, readily countenance extensive regulation of the market.
Strange times, to put it mildly.

I often see in the Covid-19 underground, the observation — accurate so far as I know — that the Democrats were highly opposed to the Trump Vaccine until, as you note, November 4, 2020 or perhaps Jan. 21, 2021 — now it’s the solution to all problems plaguing civilization! 😀If Trump had proposed slavery reparations, the summary executions of all possessors of Confederate insignia, the welcoming of any foreigner, with all expenses paid and an instant Green Card, the abolition of all private property or free legalized drugs for all, the Dems would have opposed it because — Trump.

            I’ve been saying for several years that all the low, mid, and even some of the high-hanging technological fruit has been picked.We are bumping up against the physical limits of current semiconductor/transistor technology.I don’t see any breakthroughs coming in AI, fusion, or similar potentially game changing tech.A lot of the claimed advances in AI are simply due to how powerful and how cheap computing hardware has become, thus permitting the algos to run that much faster. We are living in a Golden Age of how much CPU, GPU, memory, and storage one can buy per dollar.Then again, everything depends on fossil fuel availability and use.Alice Friedmann has written a pretty interesting sounding book called, “Life after Fossil Fuels.”I listened to an interview about it, and she makes the excellent, seemingly obvious point that, without diesel-powered trucks modern industrial civilization dies.

                I am obviously NOT a STEM guy, but I’ve been wondering about those algorithms for quite a while. For instance, I listen to the streaming music services – Pandora, Spotify, I’m sure I’m forgetting a few. And… their algorithms are terrible, and while I’m willing to bet that for mainstream music it’s all payola, the stuff I’m looking for doesn’t make anyone a dime. It’s just that they still have humans tagging things for the algorithms, and those tags are things minimum wage H1B drones come up with.Example: So you hear some composer and you think “gosh, that’s an interesting thing he’s doing with the cello there, let’s get more like that.” So you try to build a “station” around it, and you get… Mozart, Beethoven, etc., because instead of tagging that piece “interesting cello work” or something, it just gets tagged “classical,” same as it ever was, despite all the “classical” stuff being separated by 300 years or so.It runs FAST, I’ll grant you, but there really are more than four “classical” composers out there. I can find every piece of music ever put to wax on Spotify, but I get those same three guys, over and over.

                    What made the catalogs of old so glorious was the curation.  Everything had a flow, product placement and groupings made sense, etc.  This is something every online retailer has done a crap job of.  Amazon’s whole algorithm seems to be #1) “Here’s a list of stuff we’re paid to list” and then #2) “If you don’t like that, then here’s a non-sensical, unordered list of 4000 things that also meet your description”

                        Evil Sandmich:  God yes.  I can’t search for something escapist to read by specifying male authors only, or no heroines of color, or pro-White fiction.  If I search TEOTWAKI fiction, or time travel fiction, I get nothing but strong womyn, usually brown, or same-sex couples.  Whether Amazon or my damned grocery store, I can choose categories to include, but never exclude (such as show me coupons for everything except pet food or baby items).  And try to compare some home appliance – looking at Amazon and various big box store websites.  Or mattresses.  No two items at any two places have the same model number; each retailer has his own variants.  No genuine differences exception confusion and higher prices.But we has consumer choice.

                    The early Pandora algorithm was the best. Its deductions about what you wanted to hear were based on actual musical qualities of the music you’d favored—often qualities you didn’t consciously recognize. For a while you could even look at what it had decided about your taste and tell it to ignore any mistaken inferences.Then, supposedly at the request of “advertisers” (always a lie) and “partners” (hmm…), the system was changed in a thousand ways that add up to merely favoring more popular music. So your station that was based on *repetitive dissonant Nick Cave-influenced small-group non-coastal American rock from the ’90s* and was full of forgotten midwestern bands that sounded like the Jesus Lizard is now a Red Hot Chili Peppers greatest hits album.Real reason, same as every other site: When suggestion algorithms gave you the kinds of results you wanted, Trump won.

                Part of this too is the limits of human understanding.  The guys who started HP could be generalized engineering geniuses, but their descendants now have to train for years, if not decades, to get a breadth of understanding required to advance their field a tiny bit.  And it of course doesn’t help that we’re producing less and less of the people who can even do such a thing.
And we see our limits with stuff like the Hadron Collider and Quantum Computing: enough brains to put the thing together, but not enough to apply it to anything.

                Everytime I hear some dipshit mention “Fossil fuels” I ask the dipshit when the big bad oil companies shipped all the dinosaurs, trees and cow fart to Saturn’s moon Titan to it could have hydrocarbon seas and Methane rain. If they ever give me an answer we can address the inter-galactic space travel that got them all to the Horse Head Nebula.Oil is abiotic.I like the story that Stalin, after the unpleasantness with Adold realized the importance of energy, and especially oil and sent a couple of scientists in the v late 40’s. They came back (I guess he had their families) and told him the trees and dinosaur bullshit that was being peddled in the West and he laughed so much he forgot to have them killed.

            We have made giant leaps in space exploration the last twenty years. The Hubble telescope alone has taught us more about the universe than all the Apollo missions put together.I don’t understand why going back to the moon is such a big thing with people. The era were human astronauts made sense ended about the same time Armstrong stepped off the lander and we’ll not see serious manned flight again until the prices allow for mass tourism.There’s not unlimited cash for space exploration and wasting them on ISS has been the biggest disaster for us desktop space cadets, I’m sorry to say. For the price of one ISS, we could’ve gotten 60 (sixty!) Hubble telescopes.Also, if we were to go all in and send a man to Mars for absolutely no reason, you just know that man would be named Tyrone.

        What we are seeing is a complex society which has reached that point in its evolution such that continued investment in complexity as a problem-solving strategy yields a declining marginal return.  All of the facile ‘solutions’ our increasingly bloated hierarchy of heterodoxy puts forth are flimsy sops that do nothing but, at best, maintain the status quo.  “When this point is reached,” when a system faced with diminishing marginal returns addresses [ineffectually]  stresses to the system out of the social or economic operating budget, “society enters the phase where it becomes increasingly vulnerable to collapse….When marginal returns decline, the advantages to complexity become ultimately no greater [for society as a whole] than for less costly social forms….Under such conditions, the option to decompose [that is to sever the ties that link localized groups to a regional entity] becomes attractive to certain components….Many of the social units…perceive increased advantage to a strategy of independence…And so, [such societies] face a downward spiral from problems that seem unsurmountable.”Excerpts from Jos Tainter, The Collapse of Complex Societies, pp.119-122We are at that point on the curve.

            Someone really ought to do one of those Reader’s Digest Condensed Books out ofThe Collapse of Complex Societies.It’s technical academic archaeology, so lots of it is dry, and I imagine few of us are qualified to judge the details… but the stuff that isn’t should be required reading (and when I’m dictator, everyone entering government service will have it tattooed on them, like in that goofy recent Mad Max movie).

                I’ve felt that Jared Diamond’sCollapsewas the sort of book you’re describing relative to Tainter.
I’ve read both. I found Diamond’s book decent. I wasn’t as impressed by Tainter’s as people said I should be.

                        My problem with Tainter was simply that it’s an academic book. Agoodacademic book, butbecauseit’s a good academic book, it’s aimed at a specialist audience, and unless you’re in the intended audience — I’m not — a lot of it will seem boring and forced. Same deal with James C. Scott’sSeeing Like a State,which I’d consider required reading if there were a Reader’s Digest Condensed Book version of it out there. Also Shafarevich’sThe Socialist Phenomenon,etc. (though Shafarevich, being both a mathematician and a guy used to writing samizdat, put summary sections in at the end and urged everyone to skip most of his examples. Thoughtful guy, Igor).Were it not for copyright — or if one had a bit of the skills possessed by freelance mariners from the Age of Sail — a lot of good, profitable work could be done, condensing academic works like that into dissident pamphlets.

                There actually IS a “condensed book” version ofThe Decline of the Westout there, but… still pretty tough. I never managed to slog through it, myself.Spengler has to be right up at the top of the list of guys much better readaboutthan actually read. E.g. Kant and all the rest — unless you’re a professional academic philosopher, you don’t really need anything more than the “for dummies” version. (You just don’t need to readThe Critique of Pure Reason.Not in translation, and certainly not in the original. You just don’t. Life’s too short. Read the “for dummies” version, then go have a beer).

                    One, perhaps the only purely valid (?) philospohical truth I learnt from Nietzsche is his valid (based on my quick fact-checking) denunciation of Kant’s claim that synthetic a priori knowledge is possible. Now don’t be scared off by these terms. The meanings are relatively simple: If Kant’s assertion were true, it would mean that a mind could know from first principles (a priori) a “synthetic” fact ( = requires additional knowledge not implicit in the statement — as would be “analytical” knowledge), without having to recur to the real world (empirical) for the missing information!  Restated: Kant is claiming that man has the power to intuit facts about the external world, without having to recur to that external world, because he has a “faculty.” As I (scarcely) grasp it*, Kant devised the claim as a convoluted support for claims to prop up metaphysical claims, including to support religious truths. If his claim is false, as Nietzsche claims it to be, all metaphysics collapses.The other Kantian biggie I browsed was his “universal imperative.” As best I can understand, this means something everybody must choose to do in all times and places. Perhaps I miss Kant’s argument, but if a choice exists, I can choose to do it — or not. So bye, bye “imperative.”Kant may be one of the great philosophers, but I think I’ll skip reading his wordy books.*If learned men, studying this stuff for all their lives, dispute and argue about it for centuries, then why can’t I have my own opinion too? 😀

        Most management in large companies are now following the same modeling for legitimacy that we see in our government.  Instead of a general edict of a leader who will succeed or fall on his sword, a consensus model is created.  The purpose of the consensus model isn’t to find the best ideas from the companies talent, but to manipulate the process through putting one’s finger on the scale and using mass propaganda directed at the employees.Most workers will see where the wind is blowing, roll their eyes, and assent to whatever management clearly wants to do.  As long as the paycheck comes in, who cares?  The actually innovative who have doubts or better ideas are crushed by the consensus architecture that is telling them 75% agree with this path, so why aren’t you being a team player?Then, if the plan goes awry, they can point to the consensus and say “See?  We all agreed to this,” and avoid taking the fall for any bad decision.Not a fan of Nietzsche, but he nailed the idea of slave moralities banding together to crush the strong.  Note the more corporations talk about leadership. the less actually happens in terms of taking personal responsibility,

            Let’s speak in plain language and call this what it is. This ‘management by consensus and mass propaganda’. This is feminine natured faggotry. Full stop. This is how women lead and crisis solve. Check with the ‘group’ to see which way all the dim vacuous other herd animals are about to bolt, which is generally AWAY from danger. Hence why every company is also so risk averse and ‘conservative’ (read: fearful) even though they preach how ‘progressive’ they are.When companies were run by men, real men, of which there are a vanishingly small minority anywhere near upper management that is how you got life altering technologies, cutting edge ideas, etc. The best you are going to get from a gaggle of hens pecking around in the ‘safe zone’ is a few more decades (years if we are lucky) on autopilot before impact.

                        That trough and incipient collapse of the  economy is part of why we have the issues we have now.When DJT came along he figured he could get a larger middle class which would benefit them and his family interests as well. Poor people aren’t buying the Trump brand after all.No way were the parasites going for that. They way they see it its a near zero sum game and if workers get anything, they don’t .This happens when your economy gets fake and fiance driven,The solution is of course regulation (or extermination but we’d rather pass on that)Upside to that is its easy to tell who is on your side. If he is socially conservative and favors industry over finance as well as limited trade and immigration he is on our side,If he doesn’t and spews the usual deregulation  bosh even he  has an R by his name he’s either too stupid to pass or actively on team Globohomo

                Apex:  Spot on.  This tension between individual risk-taking and innovation versus group-think/being a team player is ever present.  And while I used to be fully on board for the individual over the group, as I’ve grown ever more genuinely conservative, I’ve come to appreciate the benefits of the community.But it’s still a delicate balance, because while a particular population group can maintain traditions and stability (and infrastructure), only a risk-taking individual can conceive of new strategies or technologies or ways to solve emerging problems.  What works in small business won’t work in a multinational corporation, and what works in a village won’t work in a nation.  Outside of timeless moral truths, most things don’t scale up well.Today we have an aging multiracial empire being run like the unified nation that emerged triumphant from a war that left everyone else in ruins.  That triumphant nation was gutted from within, demographically and economically, and was never a long-term economic or political model (unless the rest of the world remained in penury and servitude).  Now we lurch from crisis to growing crisis .  . . and there is no one in the official pipeline who has the ability to conceive of its scope, let alone how to resolve it.Heard from contact in El Paso – people who own an apartment or two as rental units are being swamped with illegals and Afghan squatters.  Local officials won’t evict them and the local press refuse to report on this.  But since it hasn’t hit Joe Normal’s town yet, he’s still more concerned with sportsball.  And his wife is more concerned with how horribly we’re treating those poor Haitians at the border.  And the blue-haired lesbian teacher at the public school continues to drip poison into young minds.  Meanwhile, prices for everything continue to rise and the world continues to stream over our border.Hey, have you read the latest about poor, free-spirited Gabby Petito?  And did you catch the game last Sunday?  And did you notice that awful reactionary that was out maskless the other day?

                    If these people had to drive through the “bad” part of town even once it might disabuse of them of the notions that they carry*.  Instead they hid behind their walls and devices so that their delusion cannot be interrupted.
*(And even that might not be enough.  When I was in Portland once I went to a Catholic religious shrine of some sort and right outside of it was a Vietnamese “ghetto”.  I mentioned this to some locals and they remarked about how that was the “bad” part of town.  Obviously these people have never seen Detroit).

                        Yeah, I bet a Vietnamese ghetto is the height of danger to a White. Why, they might sell you a bowl of spicy noodles or some other assault.
On a more serious note, I grew up in the suburbs of DC. We got plenty of the “boat people” 1975 and later. While you’d occasionally read about a Vietnamese gang incident in the local papers, that was pretty rare.
I can assert first-hand that they were damned good soccer players despite their short stature. 😀

                You think businesses are badly run by women try volunteer organizations.  Groups of women are good at getting things done, eventually, but woe unto you if you’re not inclined towards micro-management, incessant second  guessing, and pettiness. And all this without even getting a paycheck for your efforts.

                Your post caused me to contemplate something…In current American corporate culture, would it be possible for a clone of Lee Iacocca to rise to the top?You know, a working-class white boy from Allentown, PA that would actually be admitted into Princeton for graduate school?  A manager that would push big, audacious risks like “56 for ’56” or the Mustang or winning LeMans or the Minivan?  A white man who would move up the ranks based on ability, aggressiveness, and merit?  A manager who would have the self-awareness to not pay himself a salary while his company was receiving government loans (I recognize he still had incentive pay)?  An alpha who would stake his entire personal reputation as the face of his company and state, “if you can find a better car, buy it”?My answer is no, it would not be possible for a Lee Iacocca clone to rise to the top in the current culture and system.  And that suggests the culture and system are FUBAR.

“As of today Karen is no longer an employee of GloboCorp”. The English translation means she got fired.
But she didn’t get fired. She just happens to longer be employed by GloboCorp. The same way that shots were fired after an altercation started between two groups of youths.

            What you describe, and this excerpt in particular: “…assent to whatever management clearly wants to do..”-is happening at the ultra-professional level on the response to COVID.The syndicates that own the hospitals (my local hospital is now one of many spanning a geographical area of hundreds of miles-its own borg) give the talking points to the freshly minted and early career doctors. These professionals were captured by debt and influenced by the lowered integrity standards of the Higher Ed Borg that hatched them. They are going to say whatever they have to say or stand around in faux solidarity as MD/MBA’s blabber in front of them for the cameras.

        It’s probably worse than people think. The Boomers who run the system are from a bygone era — one where the country was overwhelmingly Caucasian and had high social trust, competence and a common culture. But the Millennials waiting to take over are also from a bygone era — the 1990s where America was still majority White and desperately wanted to shed all traces of racial differences.“Wouldn’t it be boring if everybody were the same?” — that’s a line I heard endlessly in middle school back in the 90s. The diversity dogma was strong back then, and those kids indoctrinated into it are the people who are about to take over. Only the demographics have changed and all the nu-Americans have no interest in giving up their privileged identities. They definitely see color, and they hate you for it.The 90s Millennials who’ll end up running things are stuck repeating their ingrained dogma in a world that has already passed them by. They’ll end up berating poor Whites into “not seeing color” while every other group does until the whole thing collapses or Whites end up legally discriminated against. This won’t turn out well.P.S. If anyone’s curious, here’s a couple of links to early 90s Nickelodeon kids television shows. Millennials grew up on this stuff. It will inform how they govern. Basically, “wouldn’t the world be boring if we were all the same?”Roundhouse, ~1993:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOC2HCnfw8Space Cases ~1994:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO0JBFlof90All That ~1994:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqI5p5pqSn4Nick News 1993: [search “episode 44” because I can’t link it due to spam filter]There are many others.

            A side note on this subject:As a Millennial myself, one of the more fascinating things about talking to Boomers, no offense intended, is noticing how much of the culture they missed back in the day. They were adults when I was just a kid. So, they didn’t see what their children were being taught; they’re often shocked when I bring it up.Take the stuff I listed above. It’s heavily multicultural, even moreso than some modern television shows. Sometimes older Americans comment on how diverse commercials have become, but the programs your kids and grandkids grew up watching were diverse long before you even noticed it. That’s the world Millennials know.Perhaps the one difference between multicultural programs then and now is the open hostility of diversity programing in the present. It’s designed to offend, because there’s no profit or goodwill in what they’re doing. Characters are race swapped, always in one direction; there is never an attempt to create new non-White characters; everything is filled with hateful messaging — “you need to do better, white man.”The 90s ethos of “not seeing color” was different. Basically, it’s what upper-middle class Whites imagined the future of diversity would look like: “One of those. And one of those. That one, too.” Nice and happy and bizarrely — unnaturally — diverse. Blacks, “Native Americans”, White Males, Indians, girls … all happily sharing the spotlight as one, no mention of race. You see that in essentially every Nickelodeon show from the early to mid 90s, along with lots of other television shows from the era (Star Trek: a black captain, a female captain … a retconned gay captain). But everything is harmonious.The programs I linked to, and there are many others, were generally welcoming. There’s nothing about “white privilege” and everyone of every race is friendly and just there to have a good time. That’s what White Millennials will think of when they think of diversity. They won’t understand when you try broaching the darker side of it with them because all they know are the Nick shows were racism didn’t exist and everyone got along. They’ll assume any manifestation of racial differences in current society must have some explanation like outside agitators or a systemic conspiracy because they know that diversity naturally produces happy people; that’s what they saw on television, anyway.It’s a fantasy that will turn out horribly wrong. Like the Boomers of yesteryear, Millennials are no longer tuned into the culture the way younger kids are, so they don’t see the hostility. All they remember are their childhoods back in the 90s when everyone got along and no one “saw color.”The new Star Trek, for example, is basically a minority and woman only club. The new, diverse cast are the best at everything. White men are deliberately cast to be the villains. The writers insert jokes ribbing the male audience and the old shows while the leaders of nearly every world in this universe are women. The producers even racially discriminated against White directors, refusing to hire them. Compare that with any of the series from the 1990s. And many kids television shows these days are teaching racist conspiracy theories like CRT. Nickelodeon didn’t do that back in the 90s.Caucasian Millennials don’t know this new world of racial hostility against them, so they aren’t going to be able to navigate it successfully. They thought a world of diversity was going to be hip and cool, not some nightmare where their favorite franchise says they aren’t welcome anymore because they were born the wrong way.

                Worse than the destruction of old franchises, is the lack of talent in creating new franchises that can capture the imagination of the general U.S. population.The last one was Game of Thrones, which predictably fell apart once they lost material from the author and now is probably permanently ruined.The rise of mass cable use created a renaissance of smart shows that one could watch if you could ignore the other filth those services were serving, but they seemed to have petered out within a decade.There’s a cultural void now, and the strategy seems to be to fill media with so much garbage nothing can rise from the wasteland.

                    I don’t see much of anything truly new or original these days. Even Game of Thrones was based on a book series started in the 1990s … by a White male, obviously. Everything is a reboot, a remake, or a Westernized version of a Japanese property.People create things that interest them personally — characters, concepts, settings — and the most creative demographic by a huge margin is the Caucasian male. That demographic is not longer free to create things that intrest them, or even associated groups like White females.Like British period pieces? Well, now all the male characters are black. Like science fiction? Now everything is melodrama, feminism, and science fantasy with poor writing because that’s what Twitter wants. Like attractive women in spy thrillers? Lol. James Bond is about to be replaced by black woman who can do everything better than him.If you’re a White guy, are you really going to do your best job writing something about people who don’t interest you? Are you going to create new things only to have them race and gender swap all of your White characters? Do you want to make something only to have it appropriated by racists who hate your people and will use it against them? Nope. You’ll probably do the bare minimum just to get by. That’s what’s going on due to these diversity mandates.Hollywood can’t create anymore due to diversity quotas and discrimination, among other things* (bloated budgets, corporate greed, audience demographic change, etc.). White males have been told to hit the road and they have. The result is a declining industry.The world sees that. Increasingly, Japanese products encroach on Western territory while the Europeans work with Chinese financiers to bypass the American industry and it’s odious focus on political correctness. I expect the US to lose much of its cultural soft power over the next generation.*Hollywood is discovering how difficult it is to make things for diverse audiences. Few things have cross demographic appeal, so they are stuck with broad brush, low brow superhero movies and things they can market to non-Whites along racial solidarity lines: Black Panther &amp; Shang-Chi, to name a few. Add in a growing Hispanic demographic that will see anything as long as it has ‘splosions in it, and you’ve got a recipe for lowest common denominator, retread, and remake trash.Hollywood Doesn’t Want WHITE DUDES Anymore, Say Movie Execs.Jul 11, 2020“Several Hollywood executives, actors and writers spoke to the Daily Mail UK this week (anonymously) and said that Hollywood is in FULL ON PANIC MODE over “cancel culture” right now. The mandate from many studios is that middle-aged white dudes (called “menemies”) are now persona non grata, as studios are TERRIFIED of social media backlash for not being progressive enough. Between this and the pandemic, some white folks in Hollywood are even selling their houses and moving out of state because they know their careers are effectively OVER.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfVrcC39R84

                Good comment.To them, and all Goodwhites, “diversity” is a place with a solid 70% white majority – all with liberal values. 30% of the population are happy, smiling, people of colour. So much spicy food and so many tasty restaurants! Lots of colourful dresses, and wise old men with beards and turbans – always happy to share their advice with young people.Most importantly, these “diverse” people will be eternally grateful to the moral white liberals, making them feel like Good People. And will especially prove that they are Not Racist.Obviously they don’t think it through to the end result of ever increasing “diversity”. It’s basically a sickening, condescending world buffet for them to make them feel good and give them new experiences without actually travelling to India. Well, they will get the real India here soon, that’s for sure 🙂

                Banana Boat:  Astute comment.  My sons used to complain that my strict limiting of their tv, movie watching, online content, etc. left them at a social disadvantage at times.  They were never the first to learn of the latest fad or get a cell phone (they thank me now).  Even at their Christian schools there were mothers whose kids saw every new ‘kids’ movie, regardless of content, and many of them were concerned that my boys played with toy guns.Boomers were lousy parents and raised their kids via tv while they were busy ‘finding themselves.’   Millennials raised their kids based on the diverse fantasy they watched endlessly on the screen.  Those White children are now massively psychologically damaged – witness all the White girls protesting for blacks or when their favorite homo teacher gets dismissed.  If there’s any hope (and that’s highly questionable), it’s with that small core of White boys who didn’t crumble under the unrelenting assault on their manhood and race, and who are not willing to go quietly into the servitude and death the elites and the envious and greedy other races have decreed for their future.

                    You let then play with toy guns?  Softie. How are they supposed to learn without practical application?On a serious note, white millenials’s kids are by and large in the teens at latest right now. There are still millenials that cant buy their own beer, folks. If you were born 1981 and had your first at 26 (current avg age of female’s first birth) he would be 14 now.  But, most millenials had to delay kids bc debt jobs etc. Most millenials’ kids are preteen or younger.

                Banana Boat, that’s a broad brush stroke.  As the father of two millennials, I can tell you that it’s not 100% across the board.One child in medicine, other engineering.  Both have become much more aware of race differences and resulting AA in their own way and manifestations as pertain to their areas of employment.  But the one thing in common is that such discovery came upon interacting with such “diversity” on the job.I still maintain this must and will win out in the end—and I maintain it will be even worse (more apparent) for follow-on generations.  Whether this enlightenment can turn things around, is another story given demographic trends now in motion.In short, whatever “happy” thoughts about diversity’s “strength” and equality/equity “dreams” was soon dispelled by having to work with such people on a daily basis.  Boomers will die off soon, but in their place will be generations of race realists, not naive dreamers.

It’s only after all these years that I can appreciate why my parents used to forbid my siblings and I from watching many of the musical acts, especially if it was hip hop or rap acts. They were adamant about protecting us from nog-culture.

            Millennials are of two types. You have the bubble boys who grew up under the shadow of their hover parents, and the patient sufferers who spent the last 20 years fighting Hajji and getting blown up for the entertainment and profit of the folks back home.When things fall apart the bubble boys will have a psychotic break, the sufferers will endure and do what they need to do to survive.  Some bubble boys will harden up, some sufferers will be swept away. At the end of the tragedy will be a fit and hardened remnant capable of overcoming the challenges of the next world, whatever it ends up looking like.

            This reminds me of a radio spot I used to hear quite a bit, around 20 years ago.  It was yet another of those Ad Council* spots that were intended to pump up vibrants at the expense of heritage Americans.  The gist of it was that a young white girl came home after spending time at her friend Maria’s house and began grousing to her mom that at Maria’s house it was so lively.  Everyone was always talking and laughing and sharing meals together.  Why couldn’t their family be more…vibrant, like those Hispanics, who are surely more American than any white family?  I kept waiting for the companion ad, where Maria comes home after going to YT’s house and tells her mom that at her friend’s house they don’t have roach traps all over the kitchen; that her friend’s yard is well-maintained and has no automotive parts lying around; that her friend’s father lives at home and provides for his family.  Alas, I must have missed that spot.* The Ad Council is one of the quasi-governmental agencies that has been promoting deviancy and anti-white ideologies for a long time.  Its staff needs to be up against the wall.

            Banana Boat: your timing is off.  Most millenials (81-99) were toddlers or not yet born when those shows were aired in the early 90s. Im an older millenial, and have never heard of them.The formative adult experiences of millenials are the opposite.  In college and entering the job market (98 at earliest for entering college, 2002-2022 for job market entry).  By then the mask was off, and we knew the deck was stacked against us non-diverse for every college and job application.  Most if not all white male millenials in a white collar or professional role have a personal “Shaqwanda got hired instead of me” story.  There is a lot of fertile ground for redpills there; you can only tell someone “up” is “down” so many times before they understand the real deal. The problem is that most of their economic survival depends on not mentioning that, ever, in any context.

“Most”. A huge cohort were. I’m one of them, so obviously the timing isn’t off. I speak from experience. And those were only representative examples anyway. All of those shows ran in reruns for years and were seceded by similar shows. Nick News is still on the air all these years later.

                    Millenials got the we’re all one race – the human race kumbahyah shtick, but that’s not new.  Every cohort has had that pressed on them, e.g. Uncle Tom’s Cabin. But Millenials both faced the results in a uniquely personal way with ever-increasing AA etc., and got to experience the narrative shift from equality and tolerance to “bake the cake, bigot.”  There is a wellspring of resentment that the boomer cohort overlays. Call it the Woodstock caldera. Once the “Image” ge-ge-generation moves on, the white position on race in politics should see huge changes.

        Many take comfort in the notion that the Elites have some sense of self-preservation and won’t obliterate themselves. One need only remember World War I and the self-immolation of the old aristocratic order. It can happen again.The three foundations of the modern order – social, democratic welfare systems, fiat money and Us military hegemony – are all under threat now, having been exposed as unsustainable. An entire class of Elites will defend all three to the death it seems, taking a lot of us with them.What comes next is anyone’s guess, but the old Elites aren’t going to bring the new system into being.

            The reason I love the Great War as an area of study is it reveals how mental structures are what guide human action. In the narrow context, the old mental structures had to be mowed down with machine gun fire. In the broader sense, they had to be obliterated along with the system that produced them.

                Ernst Junger said something similar, about his time in the trenches. Nowthere’sa guy we all should read, if he weren’t so… Teutonic… about everything. (Meaning: Not an easy read, at least in translation… and, I suspect, in the original too). My impression (on limited reading) is that he’s what you would’ve gotten if Nietzsche had actually gone to the front.(Another reason Junger is such a tough read is: He’s all in on the idea of war as the great cleanser and uplifter of the human race. And yet, hehasto know how random and pointless it all is, charging machine guns, since he did it so many times himself… see what I mean?He actually did it,getting wounded 19 times in the process. If anyone knows a thing or two about war, it’s Ernst Junger. And yet, he justcan’tbe right….)

                    Like many things, the poison is in the dose (the French in WWI), and also, the medicine will not work if the dose is too low (without some grand existential threat a standing army is little more than a grift operation).

                    Both world wars, especially the 1st, were examples of Darwinian evolution in reverse.  The best and brightest of the generations fighting were destroyed.  In the WWI your officer corp was composed of the highly educated, elites and they were expected to take the lead in all actions.  They were wiped out in higher proportions than the common “grunt” soldier.WWII was not much different.  Veteran’s in the Pacific will tell of losing officers until the platoon was directed by a Sargent.  Americans, being fairly independent and prone to take the initiative faired fairly well.  But when the Japanese lost their officers, they we easily mopped up.

        I hear it said — even Tucker says it — that the ruling class is looking to import a new demographic to gradually replace the old and to ensure the dominance of the Dems. I’m not so sure.I’m inclined to see the new arrivals as the tip of the Trojan Horse (to mix a metaphor) whose occupants will turn on their benefactors and, to further their own ambition to rise in status and power, will seek to attack what they perceive to be the weakest identity. Right now, that’s white America but should a collapse come, that may change as white America isn’t the identity most dependent on government largesse once the tap closes an the faucet stops running.I say “white” America. There are other identities beside racial ones but the powers that be seem to be spoiling for a race war, so that particular division of the American people, rooted or just now transplanted, may prove to be foremost.

                I don’t see it. Looks like the Regency is all in on all 33 Million Haitians coming here just to start. Latinos don’t like it, they have issues with Salvadorans coming over (if they are Mexican and particularly Nortenos) and being ruled by Haitians was not their goal. They don’t like it …But the power of voting fraud means the Regency and Hereditary Ruling Class can do what they want when they want without any issues. Even if some Dem Congresscritters don’t have great fraud operations and get wiped out, the Regency will make the Special Assistant to the Undersecretary of Diversity. The media is in a tizzy about flying reins of a Latino Border Patrol officer being “whipping innocent fleeing Black people” in Del Rio Texas. This is directed. The mostly female and gay Ruling Elite want and need lots of Haitians and other Africans. Particularly given the preference for fatties and such.Agreed that the lower ranks are getting hammered by diversity in places like Yale and Harvard and the feeder prep schools, but those don’t count. The alliance of the Hi-Lo country just got higher and lower: the Upper Ranks of the Ruling Class and the African Third World. That is after all the mindset. It takes the structure and form of the Hi-Lo Country alliance, upper class Whites and immigrants, to its functional extreme — the Ruling Elite getting willing warriors to destroy the people they hate: the now mostly White/Latino working and middle class people.

                    And I’ll raise you some optimism: white flight is unsustainable, society will have to retreat to the cities, and that means the cities will have to be made liveable again. No more real estate Ponzi schemes.I think Kunstler (yeah, yeah) is right. None of this garbage (and admittedly a lot of good things) would be possible without cheap oil. Especially the part about saving the world.As for the high tech overlords, how would they power that tech? Wind farms and solar panels, portable fusion generators? Nope, they’ll be burning American coal. Carbon is king, and without the spoils of empire, the fake American Dream goes out the window.

            The ruling class doesn’t have that much foresight. If they did, then we wouldn’t be in this mess. They definitely see the short term benefits of importing a new, so far compliant, demographic who’ll ensure their absolute power. These people are so without honor, so without loyalty that’d they’d happily live in comfort in the present even if they knew their policies would ultimately destroy the country generations from now. What’s it to them? They’ll be long dead. That’s the kind of people you’re dealing with.

                The problem isn’t just the ruling class but the contagion of their culture that has permeated even the ranks of the dissidents. The elite culture is THE culture that effectively drives all the cows into the milking barn, then on to smithfield. Thinking about the future is a lot to ask of a culture that has no heritage – or at least one that exists for anything other than a generator of perpetual sin that must be cleansed by progress.By the time the unmarried childless 30-something strong independent womyn holding the “refugees welcome” sign learns any number of the lessons on offer from the dusky reality that actually orders the universe outside her sushi and yoga zip code it is far too late to be talking about “common sense immigration policy”.All great wars demand a sacrificial generation or three. Our culture war is no different.

                    100% agree. I’ve heard that sentiment from friends and family for decades. “I’ll be long gone.” “That’ll be your generation’s problem to solve.” “Why didn’t you didn’t you get a Master’s and a career at X corp like your friends?” Not so much these days, though!
As for the sacrificial generation(s), there’s a love of the cross but an unwillingness to take it up. That’s what kids are for, apparently.

            I think that at some point it’s inevitable. We see this with the Muslims in Europe. They don’t “assimilate” nor do they contribute anything financially to society. They create powerful enough enclaves that are scary enough so that the weak liberal ruling class leaves them alone.They now have no-go zones. It happens slowly, then all at once, but one day we will wake up and find out that one of these zones has been declared part of a caliphate and no longer part of Europe. The same situation will happen with Mexicans in the Southwest, and Chinese on the coasts. They are already de facto foreign countries.There’s also a similar situation in Canada. We seem to be importing millions and millions of low wage indian and other 3rd world workers from every corner of the globe. Canada basically runs fraudulent ad campaigns overseas. They’re promised riches, but in reality they are living 15 to a house, and working minimum wage, in debt from their “degree”. For now, they’re compliant. But for how long will they be content living in hidden suburban slums, serving white people at McDonald’s for peanut wages? It’s not 1990 and it’s hard to get ahead.

            imbroglio: As far as “gradually replace the old,” that’s already an established fact.  Whites of European, Christian descent are perhaps 54% of America’s population.  For children under ten, it’s officially 50%, but official stats always lie and they also count Jews, Persians, and various others as White, so it’s realistically more like 45%.If you truly consider those “just now transplanted” to be Americans, I’m not surprised you think it’s “the powers that be seem to be spoiling for a race war.”  Do you also post comments saying that “they are trying to divide us”?  Certainly the elite will use and exacerbate whatever conflict exists, but that existence is basic and primal and very, very real regardless of official policy.Of course the imports will turn on their masters.  AOC and the squad have constantly challenged face-lift Peolsi’s hold on congress.  At times that benefits us (such as refusing to fund Israel’s Iron Dome) but that is merely an unintended side effect.  The reason we are falling apart is precisely because of all the squabbling and rival races and ethnicities, each seeking turf and power and influence and money.  And the White elites are clinging to their positions, but don’t realize the faux reality they remain rooted in is crumbling beneath them, and what awaits them (but first all us dirt people) is free-fall from the precipice they’ve brought us to.

        Angelo Codevilla died yesterday. He was one of the first intellectuals to spot the corruption of our ruling class and to describe it in detail. Just before he died, he wrote, “…the ‘War on Terror’ advanced the ruling class’ perennial objective to limit the freedoms of Americans outside its orbit, and perhaps shut down domestic opposition. ”Precisely right.Z’s instincts have corroborated and expanded upon what professor Codevilla has been writing about for several decades now. Here is Codevilla’s last article…https://amgreatness.com/2021/09/21/angelo-privilege/Z Man is the latest iteration in a line of thinkers beginning with Sam Francis and Angelo Codevilla.

        Not a comforting thought, realizing our ruling elite are wishing on a star to get through the latest crises.  I don’t know if rigor mortis has officially set in, but we have to be close to everything locking up.  At any rate, I agree with glenfilthie that it all needs to be burned to the ground.

        I wonder if we’re in the 1970’s American Motors mode of crisis culture:– We need new money for new products / we need new ideas to solve problems– We can’t get new money for new products / we won’t accept or allow new ideas– We refresh our existing models around the edges with what money we have and hope they generate money for new product / we restate old ideas as new with hope they solve the problem– Refreshed product doesn’t generate more money / old ideas expressed as new fail to solve issue– Return to step 1) until there’s no money coming in / no ideas work and the enterprise collapses.Or the US gets bought out by the French, like AMC got bought by Renault. And then AMC got bought by Chrysler to get Jeep, and Chrysler with Jeep got bought by Mercedes-Benz, and then got bought by Fiat, who got bought by (checks notes), Peugeot.Man, we’re gonna be changing hands a lot if this is our lot in life.

                AMC was originally a merger to survive. Post WW2 the “Independent” car makers (Not Ford, GM, or Chrysler) were completely unable to go toe to toe with the Big Three. They just didn’t have the volume. Originally AMC was to be Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard. Studebaker and Packard thought they knew better, merged, and then read each other’s balance sheets. The best analogy would be a man with two broken arms partnering with a man with two broken legs aiming to make one healthy man. Hence why you can’t buy a new Studebaker or Packard.AMC focused on small, affordable cars (any of you who’ve heard of the Rambler, that was AMC) and actually shook up The Big Three when Rambler made it up to #3 in sales behind Ford and Chevrolet. Then they went stupid and tried to go toe-to-toe with The Big Three in the 1960s and started bleeding cash. By 1970 what would end up being the last viable cars for AMC, the Hornet and the Gremlin appeared. Then the following happened:– The two seat AMX failed to sell enough to recoup costs– The four seat AMX, the Javelin, failed to sell enough to recoup costs– The Ambassador/Matador sedan failed to sell in numbers to raise enough profit, being the first example of the “change the taillights, change the grille, stick a new name on it, call it new” strategy.– The swoopy Matador coupe: Bomb– The infamous Pacer: BombSo by the late 1970s AMC is stuck with the Gremlin, which gets called the Spirit, and the Hornet, which gets christened the Concord, and has to nip, tuck, and freshen cars that are a decade old. So the cycle is:– We need capital investment, banks won’t lend– Freshen what we have with some new names and trim, hope that adds to the bottom line– People catch on said cars are old wine, new bottles.– Sales drop– Back to step 2 in hopes of getting to step 1Lather, rinse, repeat.Until the French show up with cash. And build cars that make AMC designs look like Toyotas. The French lose their shirt in the US, Chrysler swoops in to buy Jeep. Chrysler has good times until Der Germans in the form of Daimler-Benz appear. Der Germans buy out Chrysler under the Americans noses. Der Germans make a go of it, but no. Then Chrysler enters the AMC cycle of looking for a dance partner with enough cash to support them crashing on the couch and adding a few bucks for rent every month.So how much of it is merge to survive and how much is money laundering is “speculative”. But how long until Uncle Sam follows the same trajectory and shows up on China’s doorstep at 2 AM with a six pack of light beer and a duffel bag?

“Their understanding of reality is rooted in a world that no longer exists.”
Also, the best case for a turnover of that class, who no longer deserve the appellation “elite”

                The “they” is contextual.  The private, the major, and the general all have a common cause, but have different goals in mind for the outcome of a battle.  The Nuleft and the entrenched imperial Elite may have common cause in defeating Heritage America, but the enemy JV members individually and sub-collectively want to make varsity, and they want it yesterday not tomorrow.  Napoleon started the Revolution as a lieutenant, not as emperor.

            Apple is a good (not perfect) example. Steve Jobs, pain in the ass that he was, got products produced that changed our way of working and interfacing with technology (cell phones and tablets without buttons, iPods, Macs), and built the “aura” of Apple.
Tim Cook hasn’t really added any new products like Jobs had. Apple has moved from innovator to establishment.
Another company that reflects it’s owner’s personality: FaceBorg.

                Steve Jobs was the first to monetize managerial culture. Apple came close to bankruptcy trying to be a tech innovator. When they switched to being a lifestyle brand company focusing on urban managerial strivers, they became a colossus. Technically, the iPod was not great shakes. What was new was the marketing. It was a display item and positional good in one. Everything since then has been the same, a devise for the user to show the world they are one of the smart set.
Depending upon your focus, Apple is either a leading or lagging indicator of managerial decline.

                    Apple is brilliant. We all should study how they managed to make it happen, turning products into identities like that. It happened ad hoc with sportsball — I’m old enough to remember when team logo baseball caps first became widely available, and whoever created the first “replica” jersey deserves some kind of Mad Men medal — but Jobs did it consciously.We could all seriously benefit from creating a distinctive (but, of course, plausibly deniable) “dissident” aesthetic. Have the Minter and Richter guys come up with a discreet, yet flashy, “Z” pendant or something. 90% of movement-building is showing others that you’re in the movement. Steve Jobs got that. Let us go and do likewise.(Yeah, I know, I’m a Fed, which is why this will never happen. May that bring us all great comfort at night in the camps — yeah, we’re all being worked to death, but at least we could spot the shit out of a “glowie”).

                        Jobs became the Silicon Valley version of L. Ron Hubbard. Those shows where he would be on stage with the turtleneck both affirming the audience’s sense of identity and promising a brilliant future was right out of science fiction. Leni Riefenstahl Sergei Eisenstein would have instantly recognized what he was doing with those shows.

                    Expanding on mmack’s point a bit, I think the key insight Apple had upon Jobs’ return was that they could reach a wider demographic by appealing to them via improved product designs, warmer user experiences (UX), and simpler user interfaces (UI).The first real example of improved product design I can remember were the pod-shaped iMac G3s:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3Young women absolutely loved those things because they were simple to set up and use, they looked, “cute,” and they didn’t look nerdy.You couldn’t get them to acknowledge the existence of any other computing device when those things hit the market, and they were the must have device of those days.

                        L. Ron Hubbard was the man, too. That’s another thing Jobs doesn’t get enough credit for — creating his own lexicon. Slapping an “i” in front of everything makes for cheap and easy jokes, but those jokes are also hellacious brand reinforcement. Reifenstahl et al wish they’d come up with something that good (although the Nazisdidhave a distinct lingo, of course). Hubbard gets a lot of grief for the “thetan” business, but everything before that is master-class manipulation. Let us learn from the master.

                    They’ll probably have been the last large corporation ever to succeed by making and selling anything, by finding and exploiting a real “gap in the market,” rather than via financial manipulation or collusion with (or secretly being) the state.
What you describe is at least as much how Apple’s competition advertised itself to you as how Jobs-Apple actually behaved. Ugliness is a display of degeneracy, not utility.
At the peak of their “lifestyle” phase, Apple forced Unix into every non-nerd’s home. Enjoy that, at least.

                    Oh no no. The iPod was a genuine game changer for portable media, much the same the Sony Walkman and to a lesser extent, the Discman, were. Frankly, pretty much all MP3 players before that sucked.

                        That’s what the marketing said, but in reality the technology was all there. Jobs wrapped it up in a design that appealed to trend setters and they did the rest. The iPod was nothing more than a display item to tell the world you were smart, which was another way of saying you were a member of the elect.
If Apple never existed, no one would have noticed. If Oracle never existed, our world would be very different.

                        @Zman – Sure, Apple did a brilliant job at both presenting and establishing their stuff as “premium”, but with the classic iPod line the marketing also did deliver a superior product. Build, studiness, usability, actually-good quality DACs; the whole thing was simply better than what came before it. I know I’m right about this because sound fidelity noticeably depreciated in models post-5g (not the “Classic” series of crap that came after). Apple switched to an inferior DAC and I didn’t bother with the line after that. You’re not completely wrong here – Apple made being a douchebag cool, but there was a span of time when the product matched the marketing claims. As for Oracle, who cares? Their products are transparent to most people. Though, Larry Ellison is a character to rival Jobs.

                        Exact same argument with the Macintosh. Apple was a moderately successful PC maker from the late 1970s with their Apple II. But they really took off in 1984 (?) with the Mac. Little innovation, except the software. Microsoft, for all its success, did not have anything comparable until Windows 3.1, 7 years later.Apple also donated or sold cheap their PCs to schools — a brilliant marketing move I’d say.At least for the rest of the 20th century, Apple had a better rep for software than Microsoft and based on my limited experience, I would say that is a truism.

                    Somewhat disagree on that one. Apple was the early leader with the II in computers for business, and being user programmable. But it let MS get most of its business while pushing the Macintosh. Which was ground breaking — the first with actual usable fonts, a WYSIWYG interface, the ability to do desktop publishing which let them survive in that niche into the 1990s. People forget how revolutionary that machine was. Yes Xerox PARC did it first, but Apple was the first to make a (very expensive) consumer machine Joe Average (if he saved up) could buy. Then you had stagnation, until Jobs was brought back to rescue the place from Sculley and Gasee, and brought in the BSD basis of NEXT computing to once again usable machines for Joe Average. The Ipod was the first usable mp3 player for Joe Average. It just worked. Same with the Iphone, there were other and better smart phones first but this was the most easy to use. That has been Apple’s selling point since the Mac: more expensive, easier to use. Now of course with their FBI spying built in, that’s negative. But their sales have slowed to a crawl and they are built for 30% margins not 4%, and with court rulings getting rid of the 30% margin in their app store they must spy on their users to make money.
