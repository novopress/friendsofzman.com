        When the money runs out sometime over the next decade, our Womb to Tomb style of government will thankfully be over. Until then our country will lurch from crisis to crisis, while the Left will maintain its perfect record of undermining every institution in the country, either denying its prominent role in this, or having a convenient case of amnesia.

I have a problem with that, we should be able to do better, and you shouldn’t be offering up any excuses.
