        Because in NH, Shaheen has already lost to Brown,(pre actual vote counting, or “discovery” of “lost” votes-not including military of course, anyway).It’s ALWAYS been entertaining to watch Dem women dig themselves deeper with big puppy dog eyes welling up with tears, ever since Ms. Clinton figured out her actual chances here, and decided to take the consolation gift from Team Obama.Think of the Steph “monitored” debate, (in spite of many well respected “neutral” moderators actually FROM NH)as a charitable “Swan Song” for Dem. “ideas” for “Governance” and legislation.

        It’s a typo but also true that a Republican things this time thinks will be different.
More broadly, as I am fond of saying because it sounds glib, Republicans are like the bike messengers of New York City, they thirst for death.

        Yeah, I confess that I just don’t get it. It’s like Lucy and Charlie Brown with the football. Really? You’re going to fall for it again?

        The only thing I can figure is that they don’t think they’ll get ANY coverage otherwise, and their “people” are still working on the principle of there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Thinking about Clinton, Inc., they could be right.
