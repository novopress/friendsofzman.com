        “Trump must become the sort of dictator his opponents claim”Of course that is exactly what FDR did. He threatened to pack the Supreme Court, outlawed the possession of gold and forced people to exchange it for fiat money, broke Washington’s tradition and was elected four times, got the Constitution amended to get inaugurated in January, passed the first national gun control law, dictated commodity prices, created a massive new tax called “Social Security,” took the nation in the biggest war in human history and created the Military-Industrial Complex, and nationalized the economy for the war.He served the exact same years (1933-45) as You-Know-Who, who was also elected in a democracy. Yet Mustache Man is derided as a “dictator” while FDR is lauded today…

            Around election time, do you recall the Left screaming endlessly about Donald actually getting tough with them?They squeaked and screeched about what a horrible dictatorial monster he was, an Abuser and a Felon as everybody knows . . . how the Great Orange Pussygrabber would come after them all, hunt them down like pier rats . . . . (gasp, gasp won’t somebody come and rescue these poor at-risk girls?).This, of course, was a defusing tactic of psychological manipulation. They claim Trump is out for blood — even though it’s been baby-pat with them so far — in order to maneuver Donald away from the position they most fear: locking all their traitorous punk asses up after 3 a.m. swat visits.Forty percent of America hates me and wants me dead. No character evaluation, but just because I exist and won’t roll with the new religion. I remind them of something they never can be, and the envy rages.  Leaves me little alternative.

                With respect to Leftist screams of existential angst.  I always refer back to the psychological concept of “projection”.  In interpreting the Left’s true motivations, it has never let me down.

                Envy is the most ridiculous of sins. You don’t get to feel good or get some fancy material possession or power. You just seethe, boiling in your rage.The only way to deal with this is to eject these people from our nation. If they won’t live in peace and will live only marinating in a state of envy and hatred, they don’t need to be among us. There isn’t a right to live in white civilization or among the people who built it.The white man presents an image of superiority even when he isn’t conscious of it. And, superiority excites envy. Destroying white civilization is the inmost desire of the league of designated victims we call ‘minorities.’-Joe Sobran

            Ran to keep us out of war, while escalating an economic war with Japan into a military conflict where the Japanese attacked “uprovoked.”
Suffered from cancer for 3 of his elections, kept secret from the American people.
Populist opponent Huey Long assasinated, no connection to FDR.
Gave away millions of lives, to live under the yoke of the USSR, while FDR could not step away in fading health.

                    Makes me think of when my Silent gen relatives wish for ‘the old days’ … and reminisce about ‘the good war’ … of their early childhoods.
It was a long con, all the way back.
Jusst pulled that book up on Amazon and will be reading it in the next couple of weeks — many thanks.
FDR sacrificed hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions of other human beings on the altar of his hubris. My old WW2 vet neighbor, to the day he died, HATED FDR.

            Mustache man never won an election in his life.  He ran for president in 32 and lost.  He was later appointed by the man who defeated him.
The party members in the Reichstag , OTOH, were elected and played a big role in his appointment.  Hitler had better numbers than any modern president or prime minister probably anywhere in the Occident.  He enjoyed like 90% approval ratings.

                “Mustache man never won an election in his life.”
A technicality. Yes, its true he was appointed Chancellor, but only because he was the leader of the NSDAP, which won enough seats in the Reichstag to form a (minority) government. But the NSDAP deputies were elected.
It’s kind of like saying that the people never voted for Roosevelt because the electors of the states did, which is technically true, but when the people cast those indirect ballots in both Germany and in the U.S. they knew exactly who the head of state was going to be.

Only Roosevelt actually got more votes than his opponent, whereas Hitler got fewer votes than his opponent and lost.  The NSDAP did not have enough seats to form a government.  There were several snap elections between the loss of the presidential election and Hitler’s appointment and the NSDAP lost seats in that time.  Plus, he was only appointed to chancellor, not to the presidency.

                        I dunno about this take. When I think of Parliamentary governments, the usual is a coalition that governs, as few parties ever seem to get over 50% of the popular vote.So whether Schick got ‘elected’ or not is somewhat besides the point — European politics IMO is all about the badckroom deals, parties cooperating to ‘govern’ (loot, start wars and avoid prosecution).He had von Papen on the Knives’ kill list, later gave him a job. Got close with von Hiondeburg, earlier had the hero of the Eastern Front of World War 1, von Ludendorff doing his bidding.How else does one get ‘lected’ in modern times? Like Biden?

                            You are missing the point.  Hitler wasn’t elected.  People can twist the facts into what they want all they want.  He ran in 1932 for President of Germany and got millions fewer votes than von Hindenburg.  This is the one and only election he ran in. He lost. Get over it.Notice I pointed out in my first post that he had vastly more support than anyone anywhere in the Occident today and probably since.  Once they were running the country, they enjoyed immense popularity and support for the party and for him.  I’m not sperging about mustache man bad.Besides, this was a one time thing that will never be repeated.  There were unique weaknesses in the system they exploited and they no longer exist.  The neoliberals are on guard.Admittedly, I’m not a fan.  I think he was the 2nd worst (at least) leader Germany ever had, behind (probably) only Merkel. They did some good things, but the whole ‘wrecking Germany’ thing takes them out of the running for the “best government” award.Germany had depression when they took over. It was in total ruins when they lost control. MILLIONS of Germany’s young men dead or severely wounded or being tortured for years in soviet prison camps.  MILLIONS of German women raped, many to death.  Every city in ruins. Large parts of the country lost to communists for 45 years.

                                That is a stupid comment, I expected better. “Get over it…”Sure, you just convinced me to voot for Hillary in the mid terrms.Even AI understoold my point:“The Nazi Party’s share of votes in German parliamentary elections varied significantly over time. For example, in theJuly 1932 elections, they received37.3% of the vote, making them the largest party in the Reichstag. However, they never achieved an outright majority in free elections. ByMarch 1933, their vote share increased to43.9%, but this election was marred by intimidation and suppression of opposition.”A vote for the NSDAP was a vote for Mr. Schick. Now perhaps a deep breath, before you take me to task … with such a stupid comment.

            Aristotle and other ancient philosophers were well aware that democracy and its successor oligarchy, were always going to create a mess and eventually a collapse of the State…Therefore, they would have to be straightened out by a dictator, with the corrupt oligarchs either exiled or executed…America’s Founding Fathers therefore created a limited franchise republic that dispersed power to the States and state legislatures…But as Franklin wryly suggested, we couldn’t keep it…Only two ways this can end…breakup into smaller, more cohesive groups (Armstrong’s AI predicts that) or collapse, probably triggered by hyperinflation….

        Well said!   Unfortunately Trump is not made of the stuff to cross the Rubicon.   He is losing on his trade initiatives, his cost cutting initiatives and immigration.   If he is serious he has to take drastic action or he should just go home and retire.   At least we aren’t in a major war at the moment.The key IMHO to his seriousness is that regarding immigration:He has not required all employers to use e-verify system.He has not prosecuted anyone for aiding and abetting illegal aliens, save a couple of judges he is using as examples, presumably.  This statute could be used against Mayorkas, right down to the Border Patrol Agents who obeyed the illegal orders as well as all of the NGOs and the UN.   Not to mention employers.He is not blocking funds aliens send back to their countries.He is not auditing the banks regarding their money laundering operations in drugs, alien smuggling or their ties to the cartels.

                Please. EVERY day the same contractors come to my town, pick up the same illegals .. while the local cops run their usual speed traps and ignore the blatant law-breaking under their noses.
How are we supposed to see a situation like this except in its true light?
The moment they began trumpeting … “Tren De whateverthefuck” you KNEW the fix was in. No matter how many TV talking heads are added to ‘the administration. … there ain’t gonna be any Operation Wetback 2.

                        SD isn’t exactly a political power, though. There are only 5 other states that only have one Representative. He might have chosen Wyoming’s Gordon, I suppose, but I’m pretty sure Kristi looks better in a dress, which seems to be one of the major criteria for nomination…

            All four are low-hanging fruit, too. Of course, neither party wants any of it. If two assassination attempts are not enough reason to cross the Rubicon*, it is hard to imagine what would be. Someone as invested in the system as Trump operates under an assumption, which actually is a delusion, that reform is possible.
*Crossing the Rubicon is somewhat of an overstatement, too, in that much of what needs to be corrected is rank lawlessness. The United States has been lawless a long, long time.

                Well said.It appears that he is a man of another age. One thing that I don’t see covered in the analysis of Caesar is that he grew out of the Civil Wars between Marius and Sulla. His father and his family were on the losing side.At some point, Caesar understood what he was dealing with because of his own family’s history. Trump is an American Businessman – of the kind of the post-war, post-moder to boo. That is, his empire is based on financialization. It worked for him. It made America great. For him, all he has to do is get America back in business. He isn’t a civilizational thinker.Well, all that said, he does have posterity. However, they may not survive the counter reaction if he doesn’t go all the way. I hope he has civilizational thinkers around him who have whispered those very real possibilities in his ear.It all comes down to Mass Deportation. He has to radically increase the numbers – via soft removal of taking benefits away and hard removal of physical arrest and removal of the squatters.

                Under Biden we probably had about 20 to 30 million illegals come here.  IMHO we need about 500,000 per month. That would be mass deportations.
That won’t happen as long as Trump continues on his current path.

                    That sounds right at a minimum. We need to get rid of all 50 million legal or not. For those legally here working in remotable jobs, tax their earnings straight from the paycheck. There is a lot of work to do.The tech oligarchy will never stand for it. Perhaps they could be the Jugurtha’s and be bribed to start training up Americans. We have all the talent we need right here.Take away the money and get very tough on crime. Death penalty without due process for illegals. Just set it up in Gauntanamo and start getting it done. They’ll be begging their shitlib sponsors to allow them to be sent to Bukele.

                        “I agree, though probably for different reasons.“Not exactly.All but a few exits ought to be blocked, to force fleeing immivaders into corridors where they can be better managed. Now, why would they want to flee?Nodes of domestic collaborators need to be broken. (This will entail the destruction of most domestic Abrahamist congregations, btw.)EveryD pol ought to have been disappeared by now, in accord with the D’s own wartime morals. We ought to be watching the understudies crapping and urinating in their pants about what they would know is foreshadowing their end, too.Somewhere along this course of events the anchor business of the immivaders would need to be destroyed, for obvious reasons. All gibs terminated without waiting for new fake laws to be declared against the old fake laws. All immivaders are declared outlaws, i.e. unprotected by the state (which we need to abolish and replace anyway.) And then, and then the panicking invaders, their logistics tail eliminated and finding theirselves drawing punches and fire,…Immigration problem solved forever after, or for a very long, whichever comes first. But no. D. Judeophile Trump is a golfing, reactionary property developer who works for Israel. MAGAmorons were played again.

                Forced deportation will never work at the numbers needed and certainly will cause waay to much blowback when the supply of criminal aliens dries up. Voluntary deportation is the only way out of this mess.What *might* work is to expand the number of immigration judges to hear all current claims of asylum within a year in order to void current “temporary” asylum stays in this country (issue removal orders)—thereby IA’s right to stay. This followed by a true *enforced* citizens-only employment law, which would punish employers of said illegals with meaningful sanctions.  E-verify can work if you truly want it too.  Right now, it is only meaningful for government agencies.In short, sour the milk and encourage voluntary self-deportation. We can then add programs as necessary to incentivize such. You could for example, pay a $1000 and transportation to each adult who signs up to leave. A thousand times a million is one billion. 20M IA’s leaving is therefore peanuts wrt cost.

            It’s very disappointing that Trump has drawn a line at removing only gang members and violent illegals because that has 80% popularity.  So what.  His approval rating will always be below 50% no matter what he does.  I would rather put the violent illegals in prison, and deport everyone else.

            I confess I did not think the tariff ploy would work to get other nations to drop their barriers, but it is working, even though he suspended most of them. Cost cutting, he’s kind of limited. Since Nixon, the executive can only not spend appropriated funds if the courts back him. Which gets us to immigration.E-verify? What happens when Judge Huntington E. Rimshott III says he can’t do that?Prosecutions? This whole essay has been about the courts deliberately setting aside laws for politics.Remittances? He could. Then what? The money stays here? They no longer stay 7 to an apartment, but rather go 2 or 3 per apartment, bidding up housing prices? They switch from menudo to burger or even steak?I’m skeptical about bank audits. Those with lots of money can afford lots of attorneys and accountants to make things look good. Possible, I suppose, but I doubt your run-of-the-mill public servant has the chops to unravel that mess.Schumer pointed out the other day that he believed the 235 (?) judges they managed to get confirmed in the last session would be enough to stop Trump. Added to the Obango nominees and the finks from the “right”, I have no doubt.You gotta solve the problem of the courts before you can hope to make changes in the rest of the blob.

                    What does that even mean? Trump wouldn’t be leading his legions into DC. The more apt is probably Alexander and the Gordian Knot. In short, DoGE. Can he get away with that? Maybe, but probably not. As someone opined earlier, he’s never getting to 50% support.
Why would he toss away the middle to appease a few malcontents who won’t be happy anyway?

                        In order to defy the system he must have enough support from inside the blob, especially the military.  He has some support but is it enough? There is no point in crossing the Rubicon if the Legions are not with you.
However at this time in which we find ourselves it is the only possible way to bring the blob under control without a national conflagration.

                            I don’t know. I think “conflagration” is a little overdramatic. The Blob is pretty big, sure, but almost all are followers. They wouldn’t be there if they had the drive to lead. There are probably around 1000 leaders, 10k at the outside. Of those, there are probably only around 100 or so who are essential to the perpetuation of The Blob.
If the pointy end were to stand down, we could have the America of our grandfathers, but with all the high-tech whiz-bangs that would make that order easier to build and maintain than it was in their day.

                            Trump’s support in the military is so near zero that when they were ordered to occupy Washington and aim their guns out at the people to secure the installation of Trump’s false successor, literallynonerefused.
That’s not the only or most extreme example, but it was on TV, so we all saw it—and instantly forgot it.

            Dont kid yourself, if he did those things federal judges would issue injunctions before the evening news the same day.  It’s not as if law is even a consideration for them at this point.  Then what is Amy Barret to do, deport all her adorable housepets?  Of course notDont get me wrong Trumo absolutely SHOULD do all that and more, if nothing else if will show how legal means are not available and build more support for sweeping the whole “democratic” order away.  But at the heart of it remains this – legal means are NOT available.  The constitution means only and exactly whatever jewish lawyers/funders/NGOs say it does.Have you seen what they did to GOD’S OWN LAW in the talmud?  Turns out it means exactly the opposite of everything God seemed to be trying to restrict.  If that didnt stop them they certainly aren’t troubled about the laws of a bunch of old gentiles.

        Years ago, I had to attend a meeting of one of the many federal commissions due to a matter that affected some land I owned.The meeting was entirely pointless, with groups coming up to either kiss their butts or complain about issues and the commission telling them “sorry pal, nothing we can do to help you.”I read more about this august body and found it was entirely pointless. It had no power to do anything because the way the commission’s rules were drawn up on voting on agenda items were precisely designed to keep it from altering the status quo.And mind you, the members of the commission were appointed by the president and they received huge salaries, travel allowances and other perks.That’s mangeralism in a nutshell. It’s designed to perpetuate itself and prevent the status quo from being altered.We need to treat the Blob like the cancer it is. We either eliminate it and take away its power or it destroys the host.

            Exactly. I’ve been to many of similar commissions. Completely pointless.
Thing is, we all saw what happened when Trump tried to do some tweaking around the edges. The judiciary jumped in with both feet (in some cases, all four feet) putting Trump in a pickle. Maybe those judges could be impeached, maybe, but they would never be removed. He’d be facing an even more hostile judiciary.
And he does not have the authority to just shut down seats, like Congress does.

        We’re still in the lead up to a powerful leader or cabal. Trump isn’t Sulla, but he is exposing the system as corrupt, irredeemable and unstoppable using the rules created by the Blob. Therefore, any one person or group that wants real power will need to ignore the system’s rules and play hardball.Trump is teaching a valuable lesson to whoever comes next. The next wave of power-hungry men or groups won’t have Trump’s nostalgia for American civic nationalism. They will recognize the Blob as just another mob wanting power and will fight it with mob tactics. South American-style government is coming our way.

                The Blob leaves them no choice. If the Blog controls and manipulates the system, there’s simply no way to play by the rules if you want to run things.
The Blob is an unnatural ruler. Sure, it has the FBI and other law enforcement, but the members of the Blob are weak, often even women. They rule by narrative and law but no muscle truly loyal to them. The FBI is loyal to its pension but if that is threatened, they couldn’t care less about the managerial class. The Blob can’t last, and Trump is showing the way.

                    Don’t kid yourself. The pointy end of the spear is the problem, as it always is. The existence of them gives most people comfort that there is some legitimate, legal means of redress of grievances, and simultaneously, discourages vigilance committees from more direct redress.
Without the pointy end, this all resolves itself in months, if not weeks.

        Based on Donald Trump’s inability to simply walk away from the Ukraine situation and his transactional orientation, I do not deem it likely that he can undertake the steps necessary to confront the Blob.  As other commentators have noted, he appears incapable of defying the courts.  Thus a Biden Administration can admit people by the millions, but deportations must be done one by one–an impossible situation.

        The courts are the last line of defense.  Trump is going to give SCOTUS a chance to prevent institutional collapse of the legal system.  The Blob is more than happy to defile themselves and the courts.  Whatever it takes to “stop” Trump.  Ultimately, I think he’ll give the court a chance to prevent collapse, like what he’s doing in Ukraine.All he has to do is resume deportation flights in violation of the court orders. As a coequal branch of government, he can tell the court that THEY, not he, are operating outside the law. The law says what it says.The other thing that needs to happen is that Cash and Blondie need to put up or shut up.  That means grand juries targeting Lawfare. Use the system against them.  Bankrupt them.  You don’t have to put them in prison to stop their behaviors.  (Though it would be nice, any DC jury would acquit.). Punish using the process.

            “That means grand juries targeting Lawfare.”
How do you target the lawfare types in a venue where the judge won’t just toss it out? It’s not much of a punishment if the process doesn’t even reach the cost of a jaywalking ticket, or the tip on an after-work drink.

                Judges of the leftist variety aren’t physically courageous.   Only a handful need suffer Arkansas-style suicides before the tone changes.  Their side murders witnesses to their crimes with impunity – like that Epstein victim last week – this is known to all.  So, regardless of what the law might say, I won’t condemn whoever might bring such things about.  Indeed, jury nullification is probably the ‘civic duty’ of the future…
If the right-wing death squads mentioned by others were to become active I would, for the first time in years, feel some real hope for America’s future.

        Been saying just this.  It’s like we’re on the Titanic and the captain and passengers have very clearly seen there is an iceberg directly ahead.  The captain is giving the order to turn, the steerage passengers are screaming that we must turn, midlevel ship functionaries are rushing to hold the wheel in position because any turn could disrupt the orderliness of the tea service in the first class cabins.The passengers are screaming louder and the captain is shouting orders and profanities while the functionaries desperately hold the wheel in place, the few first class passengers are not overly bothered either way as they are listening to a delightful chamber orchestra and are only hearing little snatches of an argument decks away.  Where IS that tea!?!

        The results we see and hate are the point of the system, so the system must change.People are warm and fed, which makes this difficult but not insurmountable. Additionally, Trump is very invested in the system and wants to reform it within its self-perpetuating rules and confines. He could start to give regular addresses on the blatant lawlessness of the courts and the tremendous danger posed by 30 or 40 million illegal aliens and their legal counterparts, and how that threatens full stomachs and heated houses in the near future. That might bring public opinion around to dismantling the Borg and throwing out the invaders. I’m certainly not holding my breath, but the current year certainly has been full of surprises. It is no small irony that the system thwarting him as he plays by its ever-shifting rules will eat him alive unless he destroys it.

            Trump (as usual by accident) is showing the next guy (or group) what needs to be done to defeat the Blob. And it’s not by playing by the rules.
He’s also showing that the Blog can be beat – by someone willing to do what it takes.

                I suspect even Trump knows what it takes to defeat the Blob–ignoring its rules and so-called “laws,” which it also routinely ignores. He also probably is too invested in the system to do the obvious. What follows will not be hesitant. Let’s just hope it is either one of ours or adjacent and prepare in the event it is not.

                    disagree.  trump strikes me as having a few things he is genuinely interested in (and so fairly well informed on them) but is very dependent on others to feed him summaries (for everything else).  e.g. he was completely unaware of all the controversy surrounding the vaxx.  look at how he let mitch pick all his judges?!

Might as well concede it will never happen, then. When people are cold and hungry, they have much more pressing concerns than an unaccountable bureaucracy thousands of miles away.
Rare is the revolution that starts with starvation. People tend to seek change when they can afford the luxury of looking past the needs of today. Why the heck do you think governments have always sought to reduce the middle class?

                    Steve is wrong. Hunger often sparks revolution. The recent Arab Spring started with an increase in bread prices. The 1848 revolutions started with the potato famine (it was not just in Ireland). The French revolution ditto. Hunger is the last straw.

                        If it’s not hunger, it is often a generalized sense of oppression or exploitation by the lower orders, which generates anger toward the elites. Examples: Spartacus slave rebellion, Wat Tyler and John Ball, the Jacquerie, revolts in Russia led by Bulavin, Bolotnikov, Pugachev and Razin. You could even include the Hungarian Uprising (1956) and the Prague Spring (1968).
Naturally, these revolts and rebellions require leaders, and the leaders tend to be wealthier and better educated than the followers, but without the restive masses, there is nothing to lead. You’d might as well lob a match into the Pacific.

        As painful as it would be, Trump ultimately won’t get a whole hell of a lot permanently done unless he goes hard core.  The system will continue to jam him up at the very least.  I guess we’ll see if he’s got the gumption for it.  “I say we lift off and nuke the site from orbit – it’s the only way to be sure.”

        It may not technically be a dictatorship, but from where I sit, The Blob functions like one. A somewhat benevolent one, especially toward its favored groups. And to defeat it (if that’s possible) a dictatorship will be required. So that going forward, it’s dictatorship (or the functional equivalent) either way it shakes out.
Although I suspect The Blob is closer to an actual dictatorship than most people would believe. But that’s another topic.

        “Trump must become the sort of dictator his opponents claim, to restore republican rule.”
Perhaps another apt comparison is with Alexander the Great and his encounter with the “Gordian Knot”. All others had tried to work “within the system” to untie the knot and therefore lay claim to “rule the world”. Alexander understood the futility of such and the myriad attempts previously made to fulfill the prophecy. He therefore drew his sword and cut the knot in half and moved on to conquer the known world.
Is Trump as smart as Alexander?

        But if Trump fails, there must be a backup plan. Another civil war is the obvious option, but that is not optimum. Too much death and destruction. The core weakness of the managerial system is cowardice. They rule behind a phalanx of LEOs and the illusion of strength, but they will not stand and fight when death is the consequence. They will flee or cave utterly when so motivated. And it doesn’t take many examples to start the stampede. Drones matter.

        Rome at that time was not in a period of spiraling decline. The USA of today is closer to the Rome of the third, fourth, and fifth centuries. It’s the US-centric system, with the USA as the central node, that’s in crisis mode. And for this Trump is offering no real alternative. As you pointed out a while back Trump is likely to be a cross between Gorbachev and Yeltsin — i.e., an ineffectual reformer to an ossified system. The latest misstep has been the maladroit attempt to make the rest of the word bend the knee on the terms of trade. It has failed. Even a loyal vassal like Japan has been adament that the new tariffs have to be annulled before it will even talk. And on reducing the tentacles of the deep state, it’s all quiet on the DOGE front as Musk has returned to running his companies.

            DOGE demonstrates that Trump’s attempts at reform are only as good as the people around him (his handlers, I believe). That’s the signature achievement of his 100 days, and he never would have come up with it on his own.

        I understand the urgency of “NOW” and the 100 days milestone is psychologically impactful.  But I still want to see what’s up a year from now.  There’s a long road ahead, even before mid terms.  At what point will the frustration with the roadblocks cause rash actions to take place?  Will we find all of Trump’s team are standard limp wristed GoP pukes?  Maybe yes, but what if no?  What happens if Trump, in a typical moment of online loudmouthing, says “Will no one rid me of these troublesome judges?”?What opportunities will emerge from the economic disruptions that are incoming?  What if some enemy, foreign or domestic, does something rash?  I feel like we’re just waiting for some kind of “accident” to spark a fire.I think we’re headed for strange times.

Accepting Vance as VP and the “tech bros” as financiers/guidance was accepting the regime’s insurance against himself. He did submit. In exchange for that, he gotsomething. (Maybe just some real estate for Jared, maybe more.) But the deal didn’t change his nature. Being elected—being endorsed by and representing so many tens of millions—grants him some freedom to act, he thinks. And if he acts, those actions maymultiply.
I’m guessing. It’s how I would behave, having been not quite fatally shot.

            Bitter reactionary:The Covid disaster broke “normal” and amped up the crazy.COVID is all that matters anymore.No offense intended to any Bros or Sisters chez Z, who experienced the catastrophic misfortune of submitting to the depopulationist V@xxines, but, at this point, you’re either Pureblooded, or else you’re headed into extinction.Circa 2035 to 2040, this will become abundantly obvious to the survivors.But getting from 2025 to 2035 will be horrifying.That decade,2025 to 2035, as the V@xxies continue to pretend that nothing is wrong with themselves; that decade will comprise the greatest delusional psychosis in all of human history.By 2040, even the moast ardent V@xxies won’t be able to deny it anymore, and their psychologies will be utterly destroyed as a result.My guess is that there will be mass suicides [on the part of the V@xxies] rather than mass assassinations of the globalist depopulationists who poisoned the V@xxies.I.e. my guess isthat the V@xxies will choose notpsychological rage &amp; fury &amp; explosion, but rather that the V@xxies will choose totalpsychological collapse, to include mass suicide.My guess is that when Cluster-B loses its Mojo, circa 2035 to 2040, there won’t be any psychological or spiritual energy remaining for the Cluster-Bs to tap into, and their Cluster-B will betray them, and leave them with nothing. And when the Cluster-Bs realize that there is indeed nothing remaining for them in this life, they will choose mass suicide.Just my guess.PS: I suppose it’s theoretically possible that some super genius of a biochemist could find a recipe for repairing all of the damage caused by the Lipid Nano Particles and their MRNA payloads and the Agilent Plasmid DNA and what not, but I suspect it’s highly unlikely that such asuper genius biochemist  will actually arrive to save the day.My sense is thatAlea iacta est.On the other hand, if I’m wrong, and the V@xxies lash out in a furious implacable homicidal rage, then it won’t be fun to be a Pureblood; if the V@xxies go thermonukular, then they will seek to annihilate the Pureblooded.Either way, 2025 through 2035 is gonna be like nothing any hominid has experienced in maybe the last 100,000 years.Stay tuned, next decade, Same Bat Time, Same Bat Channel…

                I don’t know whether there’s a 21st Century Mohammed lurking in the shadows right now, but the V@xxpocalypse could very well come to mirror the Plague of Justinian, which allowed the nascent Islamic religion to burst out suddenly from Arabia, and seize control of much of the Mediterranean [because so many Occidentals had perished in the plague]; the Occident just barely managed to defeat the Arabs in Southern Europe, courtesy of Charles Martel.

It seems to me that the V@xxpocalypse could easily lead to the emergence of figures similar to Mohammed &amp; Charles Martel.

                “Stay tuned, next decade, Same Bat Time, Same Bat Channel…”I like it!Wish I were anywhere near as optimistic. I think the depopulationists have been dropping the less virulent variants on us the whole time. The failures of the “gain of function” research. Some day, they will release one of the successes — 25%+ lethality, but which can just be blamed on another coronavirus mutation. (That’s why coronavirus, BTW.)The jabbed will be going extinct, sure, but over decades. We Purebloods will, in disproportionate numbers, get to experience the joy of death by severe respiratory infection, and will be mocked for having doubted “The Science”. Those who survive will be increasingly wondering about their own decision, when their jabbed friends got by with minimal deaths.They will just keep upping the lethality until they get down to the 500k or whatever population they want.

I hadn’t thought about them upping the lethality &amp; accelerating the process.
I was thinking more in terms of them killing us slowly with (((their song))):

Apparently that’s how Albert Bourla’s livestock experiments proceeded; each new generation of the livestock was inoculated to be slightly less fertile than the preceding generation, until, after several iterations of generations, all of the ewes &amp; the rams were effectively sterile.

        What is going to destroy Trump once and for all is his support of that rogue state in the Levant. The bombing campaign against the Houthis is not going well – apparently a F-16 “fell off” an aircraft carrier as it was taking evasive manuevers (obviously I don’t believe this story). Support for the rogue state is going down with every passing day – even boomers are starting to see the light. He’s busy torching the first amendment and wasting political energy by trying to deport legal residents who committed the crime of criticizing the rogue state. In doing this he is laying the groundwork for President Ocasio-Cortez to drag us all into camps. This is to say nothing of the Epstein files which was bungled spectacularly by Fox News Correspondent Pam Bondi, and we all know that it was bungled because it so deeply and heavily involves the rogue state.It’s really tiresome to bring up the rogue state consistently, since there are so many other things going on. But I bring it up to point out that this is THE central issue of our time and the Trump administration has not only failed on this but it is dragging down his entire adminstration and wasting energy that could be going into other things. As can clearly be seen, his calculation that supporting these people would give him a freer hand to solve issues is totally wrong.

You’re right that he’s burning his capital while serving his master, the master nation. His calculated support however was all about installing DJT in the White House. He’s the consummate vain collaborator, and his descendants need to be dealt with accordingly to teach an appropriate lesson. Their end ought to be so shocking that their destruction will remain politically relevant until the expiration date of talmudism, which I gather is about 215 years from now.

            Been thinking a lot about those Epstein binders. It was obviously a message, but to whom? And what was the intended message?My initial thought was just scrubbing everything that could taint a jury pool, so as to allow the possibility of prison time. But barring extraordinary circumstances, there is no fixing the problems with the judiciary this term, or even the next couple terms.My current working hypothesis is a major release about a year from now, maybe a month later. This would be a serious takedown of as many Dems as possible, as well as the worst of the Repugs, including the truly abominable John Roberts. Trump will, obviously, have a new Chief Justice nominee waiting in the wings, hopefully to get confirmed before the election.Then if the election goes south, if Independents decide to support kiddie diddlers instead of stringing them up, and Trump will spend the whole rest of the term like he spent his first term — go full scorched earth. Julian Assange, Glenn Greenwald, Tucker Carlson, Charlie Kirk, Matt Tiabbi, Seymour Hirsch, hell, dig up Gary Webb so he can get in on the action. Replace some of the documents that are classified simply because they are embarrassing with copies of same, but with some big boobie watermarks, so there’s no doubt that Kilroy was here. The originals are sequestered somewhere secure, and copies go to the journalists who will see to the release.Like someone said earlier, The Deep State will exact its punishment on Trump. So he might as well be the chaos agent he was born to be.Is this in the cards? Dunno. If I had the ‘nads to be in the Oval Office, I think that’s how I’d play it.

        Trump needs to defy the courts, but explain that the courts are basically making up rules and defying the laws as they are written.
The court can make up crap like gay marriage because there is no law that says marriage is between a man and woman.  They and steal an old lady’s home, like they did in Kelo, because taxes can be interpreted as a public need, as perverted as such a thing is.
But to stop the executive from performing executive functions is contrary to the written law.

            The early Russian Federation science establishment had to be cut drastically. I think (educated guess based on their recovery, haven’t seen any hard numbers on funding) that they preferred to support engineering when things were tightest. There were literally highly qualified PhD physicists driving cabs and they were making more money doing so than the physicists who were lucky enough to not get laid off.
It will happen here, too. The only uncertainty is just how long down the road can they kick the can.

        Astute analyze by Z. Alas, Trump is not a cross the Rubicon type of guy. In some ways, shown in his often good instincts, Trump is a rebel from Republican conformity. Republicans pride themselves in playing by the rules Democrats establish for Republicans.Trump will dip his toe in the Sula water but the minute he gets push back he prioritizes playing by the rules over winning even though if he doesn’t win, he will likely go to jail.Trump and all Republicans don’t have it in them to be a Jugurth unless it is to safeguard Israel. It is the Democrats who have Sula’s approach to achieving their goals. That is why they will win in the end.

        For an interesting take on the Jugurtha, Sulla and Marius narrative, I highly recommend Colleen McCullough’s novel “The First Man in Rome”. The level of detail is Tolkienesque. Apparently she was something of a classics scholar before she hit it big with “The Thorn Birds”.
Sulla as a charming, murderous theater kid may be a bit much, but she does illuminate the fractured politics that made the Roman Republic (and ours) ungovernable.
Trump, unfortunately, is more Crassus than Sulla, when what we really need is another Augustus.

                Allegedly, Crassus was captured by the Parthians and forced to drink molten gold, which they believed was the object of his expedition.
No doubt many of his enemies would consider that fate appropriate for Trump.

        A bit more recently, the Soviet blob imploded under its own weight, admittedly an oversimplification.But the European, Japanese and South American blobs continue to grow and usurp.Which result will it be? We’re the only polity with high personal firearms ownership and semi-automatic weaponry. Seeing Trump fail as the borg assimilates him may inspire a field general among us.More likely, our distributed architecture will enable the blob to reaasemble itself. Once it achieved sentience and self-awareness as a united thing, and as it survives attacks, the blob could only become increasingly clever and resilient. Only the blob can destroy itself. If this scenario plays out, expect severe pain and dystopia.

Don’t fight the last war. Why do you think the Blob put the crosshairs on the special forces vets? Sure, to some extent, they fear the warfighting abilities, but by far, the biggest threat they pose is their training in how to create an effective guerilla force.

            There won’t be a field general rising from the populace to lead the rebellion.  The only chance is a split among the States—as in the Civil War.  From this nucleus there may be pockets of civilian organization and rebellion, but as we saw in Kansas it won’t be pretty, and not really effective toward the goal of separation and independence.

        double check me, but i’m rather sure it was Marius who defeated Jagurtha, later a civil war broke out between Marius faction and Sullas, which Sulla won and then named himself dictator.  Marius also reformed the army, making it professional as opposed to civic duty.

                That i hadn’t heard before but it wouldn’t surprise me.  I know he wanted a generalship for a campaign in the east after the war and that he and Marius were also competing for that.  Which is what caused the civil war.

        De Republica, advocates the cause of justice against injustice with great force and keenness. The pleading for injustice against justice was first heard, and it was asserted that without injustice a republic could neither increase nor even subsist, for it was laid down as an absolutely unassailable position that it is unjust for some men to rule and some to serve; and yet the imperial city to which the republic belongs cannot rule her provinces without having recourse to this injustice. It was replied in behalf of justice, that this ruling of the provinces is just, because servitude may be advantageous to the provincials, and is so when rightly administered —that is to say, when lawless men are prevented from doing harm. And further, as they became worse and worse so long as they were free, they will improve by subjection. To confirm this reasoning, there is added an eminent example drawn from nature: for “why,” it is asked, “does God rule man, the soul the body, the reason the passions and other vicious parts of the soul?” This example leaves no doubt that, to some, servitude is useful; and, indeed, to serve God is useful to all. And it is when the soul serves God that it exercises a right control over the body; and in the soul itself the reason must be subject to God if it is to govern as it ought the passions and other vices. Hence, when a man does not serve God, what justice can we ascribe to him, since in this case his soul cannot exercise a just control over the body, nor his reason over his vices? And if there is no justice in such an individual, certainly there can be none in a community composed of such persons. Here, therefore, there is not that common acknowledgment of right which makes an assemblage of men a people whose affairs we call a republic.
