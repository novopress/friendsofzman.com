            What if everyday you woke up and knew you were the problem?That is what they do every day.There was a time when  American blacks did not obsess of skin. Up into the 40’s, most prominent blacks held two opinions. One was they had to fit in with the white world in order to have a chance. The other is they had to control the portion of their people who could not behave. That was the Booker T. Washington wing.The minority opinion was the W.E.B. Dubois view. That was a focus on being black and being separate. Instead of joining in with the whites, blacks had to carve out their own space, from white America. The “keepsing it realz” faction came to dominate the Civil Rights movement with the help of the Left.

        I suspect this became a thing when LBJ put the nails in the coffin of the black american family.  Holding onto the blackness of one’s being for dear life is a desperate attempt to connect the ancestral dots.  Books have taken the placeof the stories of actual family members whose existence was precluded by the welfare state.  The Great Society is peopled with psychological orphans struggling to find a home.

        Their happiness lies in their unhappiness, and they will never be happy with what they are and what they have.I have a (distant) relative who is African. I see many qualities in her. She can be witty and friendly, but yes, her focus is on her ‘heritage’ even though she lives and moves — by choice — in a world where this does not matter to others. She is accepted for  the person she is, not for her skin colour. No one is against her and the family she married in to, from what I can see, accept her fully even though they are white. Her Facebook posts however are frequent and rarely about anything but being black.I have no doubt this is for her audience ‘back home’ and therein lies the problem. As far as I can see she still sees where she comes from as home and gives the impression that what she has here — as I say, all by choice — is less important to her. Temporary perhaps and maybe just a stepping stone to returning to what she knows and loves more.

        Being obsessed with skin color and racial solidarity does not necessarily impede progress and innovation (Nazis for example); it’s low math aptitude that does. Too many Blacks of West African ancestry cannot complete the necessary education to advance in society. I’m sure there is a mix of cultural an biological explanations for this I’m leaning towards biology but, as the link below mentions, desegregation probably didn’t helphttp://www.theliberatedmind.com/2013/06/did-integration-hurt-black-america.html

        Not only obsessed with skin color, this man is an apologist for Islam. At least it seems that way to me. He plays the typical Leftist role of equating Islam with other religions, when nothing could be further from the truth. But then, his anonymity is a blessing. No one reads him who hasn’t stumbled across him by accident.
