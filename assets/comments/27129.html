        I liked how the author of this article carefully describes  the generational succession that goes from A to Z in a matter of (a few) years, relatively speaking. The tragedy is that we haven’t been able or willing to fix that entitlement button that lies dormant in all of us.  The author gives hope in that after this latest paroxysm of chaos concludes,  that the new generation will begin again.  I fail to see anything like that happening when A.I. intends to render the human being extinct. If A.I. is successful there won’t be any biological humans left to start again by 2050.  It’s not a good thing.

        There are basic differences in the teachings of Catholicism vs. Protestantism that tie directly into the “robber baron” label for the “captains of industry” in the 1800s.  The old “robber baron” scenario where the “captains of industry” made massive wealth while paying their employees a pittance comes to mind.Under Protestant teachings, this trait is to be admired and encouraged, unlike Roman Catholic teachings which demand “fair pay for fair work”.Under Catholic doctrine, “good works” (which Protestants eschew and ignore) are a requirement.  Catholic employers ARE responsible for the well-being of their employees.Of course, there are exceptions.  Protestant Henry Ford paid his employees well above market wages (at the time) and saw his business succeed immensely.  The eight-hour workday also contributed to Ford’s success.  Of course, Ford’s reasons were not entirely altruistic as labor turnover was extremely high as assembly line work was monotonous, to say the least.  Henry Ford’s writings did showed his desire to uplift the common man and allow him to “enjoy the fruits of his labor”–traditional Roman Catholic principles to say the least.This treatise is not meant to denigrate the millions of good Protestant believers, but merely to show the doctrinal differences that (used to) exist between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.  The “judification” of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism is a poison that must be removed.One could safely argue that The Third Reich government and labor policies were more akin to Roman Catholic doctrine than to judaic-influenced Protestantism.  Under the Third Reich, labor was “monetized” and given true value, unlike the judeo-Protestant influenced “robber baron” attitudes of the day where paying your employees as little as possible while amassing great fortunes for yourself was sacrosanct.As an aside, Protestant teachings put the blame on ordinary people who could not amass wealth on themselves—not on the “robber barons”.

            There was a reason for the Reformation. Your comments demonstrate you can’t see religious totalitarianism I. e. Romanism for what it is and would like to blame everything evil in the world  on the prots. Good luck with that.

        Wall street sees “labor” as being a necessary evil, its true value to be minimized at all cost while valuing the CEOs and “stockholders” above and beyond their true worth.This even applies to CEOs, that run their corporations into the ground while still receiving massive “rewards” for their “expertise”.Let’s not forget the corporate vultures (a la Mitt Romney) that specialize in parting out viable businesses in order to maximize their “profits”Henry Ford “got it right” when he CREATED a market for his cars by making them inexpensive while paying his workforce a decent wage. He realized that a well-paid workforce would be able to buy his products, among other things. It could be safely argued that Ford, CREATED the middle class. Automobiles, once “playthings for the rich” were made affordable for the “ordinary common man”.Henry Ford KNEW who the banksters and vulture capitalists were and made no bones about calling them out and naming them, Father Charles Coughlin did the same thing and was ostracized by the Catholic Church for pointing out the TRUTH about our vulture capitalist society.“Vulture capitalism” can be defined as the owners of businesses and industries that collude with each other, also in collusion with the “money types” (banksters) depressing wages solely to increase their stockholder “profits” at the top while impoverishing those who actually WORK, producing their products.All one has to do is look at today’s CEOs, even in failing companies, being paid exorbitant salaries, along with stock options and other “perks” while pleading poverty, pushing down wages for their employees.Today’s capitalist “mantra” is that labor costs must be as cheap as possible while the “value” (profit) to the stockholder must be as great as possible. Sacrificing labor on the altar of “maximum profits” NEVER works in the long term.Of course, in the short term, with cheap Chinese goods flooding the market, the economy looks, good, but without CONSUMERS who hold jobs that pay reasonably well, all bets are off. There needs to be a balance between profits and labor.Presently, labor is looked upon as a “necessary evil” to be minimized at all costs. The problem arises-without labor there are no consumers. As I previously stated, a “balance” must be maintained. Labor is not evil, but a necessary component of capitalism and it has value, something that is not taught in business schools.Pre-WW2 Germany’s economic successes and the rapid rise of the German economy was predicated on labor being assigned “value”and monetized-something that is (and has been) missing in capitalist societies today.If labor costs need to be trimmed to assure “profit” at the top, something is seriously wrong. In fact, in the well-paid American automobile industry, labor costs account only for approximately 10% of total costs.Offshoring production results in consumers (customers) being “lost”.  Employees are also consumers and customers .As to “tariffs”, the American country ran on tariffs from its inception until 1913, when the “income tax” and “federal reserve” was established.The American economy is being propped up by the “social safety net” which obscures the TRUE economic situation in the U S .

        It’s a good plot for a movie or if you’re trying to keep the brainwashed masses propagandized and blind to the brutal bitter end. The truth is it’s the same lineage with the same nation-destroying scheme for millennia. Most can’t piece it together because the history we’re given is largely fiction. They’ll just continue to follow the image of the beast because if you don’t know who you are or who your enemy is, you will lose every battle.

            Good essay agree.  However no one will ever build back a free country,  instead everyone will be under a globalist tyranny (World Economic Forum agenda 2030) where no one will own anything,  and the slaves under a digital currancy soon.  ( 90% Americans lack critical thinking skills) who also condone socialism taught for generations in public schools and colleges indoctrination.  We have no statesmen,  just traitors.  We quit voting decades ago, learning about globalism, chose to be child free also. he is 80, me 77.  Lived  during the best years.  pity the young.

        “When the Boomer politicians took over in the 1980’s and 1990’s they started to auction off their inheritance. The first step was the financialization of politics.”Charles Hugh Smith also sees a big note of optimism, as contained in yesterday’s “Bretton Woods ll.”The peg of gold to rubles heralds a return to resource-based values, aka reality, and a multipolar world.  The J**ish Century will collapse under the weight of its own debt, and the Yankee Question with it.When financialization becomes as worthless as its scrip, the Landfill Economy of reckless growth, consumer trash, and unfettered speculation will return to values of thrift and real value.The frantic pace will slow, the fantasies evaporate.  The spoiled kids in the high chairs will at last be constrained by real risk.  And, hopefully, a high degree of personal physical danger.Maybe Murray will be repudiated, and they’ll have to start sharing campgrounds with Joe Normie again.Then we’ll see who can outrun the bear!

            While things seem dark, remember the power of a single man to inspire courage. Think how the British must have felt after Dunkirk. Nazism over-running Europe in a race against communism. London facing nightly bombing a few months later. Then Churchill railed a nation.

        Joe Kennedy (the patriarch) left three quite famous sons, the politicians. But less known and scarcely mentioned at all in his Wikipedia entry, was son Joseph Jr. (Who oddly lacks his own Wiki entry) This son was killed in 1944 when he was piloting a plane that was in essence an early prototype of a cruise missile. A human pilot would take off in a bomb-laden plane. The idea was for him to parachute out and then the plane would be flown via remote control into its target. Alas, in Joe Jr.s case, something went wrong and the plane exploded before he could bail out.I mention this story because it squares well with Z’s story today. The Kennedy’s were a family of privilege even by WW II; that the eldest son died in a high-risk experimental wartime operation speaks volumes about the times. By the 1960s, a safe assignment at HQ or at the Pentagon would be more likely.  Today, well they probably wouldn’t have anything to do with the military at all.

        Maybe it is a distinction without a difference, but what you describe as a “tantrum” I see as a cynical, calculated move to try to keep the party going a little while longer. To wit, the point of the war was to divorce Russia from Europe and let the Empire still be the big man on campus after his hair started to fall out. That they screwed the pooch in the process and likely have accelerated the economic collapse of the West is more or less a whoopsie. The WEF proved to be quite retarded. I hope Schwab and Gates and Soros get ground up into Chinese dog food sold at Walmart to Dirt People.We’ll be lucky to escape a nuclear war because these selfish children want to take everyone else out if they don’t continue to get the biggest piece of cake. The same happened with the JudeoPuritans and the Southerners, of course, but they didn’t have nukes.

        Falconry is a hobby among Mideastern potentates.   The bird returns the prey to the owner.  The bird doesn’t know why, it’s simply trained.  Trained to hand over the prize,  receiving a stipend.On the back of the continually atrophying dollar, see the two circles, that’s font and back of the Seal Seal of the United States.  Notice the eagle, such a mighty raptor. And above the eagle, see the six sided Seal of Solomon.   Solomon’s Seal was placed there in honor of Chaim Solomon, an investor in the American Revolutionary war.The eagle flaps about the world, raptoring, but the bird doesn’t keep anything.  The star is about the eagle in the food chain.  Until Eagle frees itself from the diminished position in the food chain, it’s all about nothing.

                As an extremely fake eagle, what chafes my ass is running around trying to jumpstart my glorious future as a hardscrabble Depression-era turnip grower.
Mom, a married woman in 1931, once told me “Boy, you’re a fool.  I’ve seen the banks fail before.”

                In the European freedom theater, 93 year Ursula Haverbeck is back in prison for telling the truth about alleged events of last century.  Heroic, she is free in a cage, the chickens flap about outside.Eagle is generally used as a metaphor in US for the USA.   Some entertain thoughts about an American Empire, and it’s symbol, the Bald Eagle, mightily traversing the globe.The American landmass is a colony of the International Bankster Empire. From time to time the focal point of their empire shifts. The American People deliver the products that our colony produces.  From mercantilist agricultural to engineering a  technology revolution to corn-fed muscle for the mobsters.When the mental grip of the mobsters is slipped, then things can be begun to be made right.  When enough have had enough and can express that enoughness.   When the courage of Ursala snowballs and enough realize that there are a few of them and they are simply using us to repress us, then we can begin to make it right.

        JFK was keen to address the generational thing in his famous Inaugural Address.“The torch has been passed, to a new generation, born in this century…”That was a mean little crack at Ike, sitting right behind him, who was born in 1895.Gary Wills pointed that out, I think in his book Nixon Agonistes. He was amused to point out that JFK, the youngest President, was talking about a “new generation” that included Reagan, born in 1911, who became the oldest president (at that time). Yet because of Dallas, everyone still thought of JFK as young and full of “viggah,” and Reagan as a doddering old fool.Now, of course, we have the doddering old Biden.

            Interesting to think of how Bidenesque he would have become, if JFK the New Frontier prez had survived his objectively disastrous 1st term. Of course Jack had far worse health problems even in his “prime.” I think Reagan was probably continuing the Kennedy legacy, i.e. old-fashioned urban ward-heeling. On culture war stuff RR was relatively reliable after he left Sacramento. However, fIscally/managerially he hocked the economy to the MIC, much as JFK hocked the federal government to newly minted “unions.” RR had a lot of assistance there from Dixiecrats, Wall Street, and Scoop-brained pols who all wanted to be the next JFK (“Always Be Close-to-nuclear-war” -old Georgetown proverb).

        LBJ did not serve.  His “service” was a total sham.
Read the Caro novels if possible.  They’re long as hell, but it shows who LBJ really was and that we’re still living in his world.
Welfare, blacks, open borders, media and financial graft,  pointless wars, stolen elections, vindictiveness that leads to public assassination. . .it’s all LBJ.

            But if LBJ’s “service” was a sham—and it was—Z-man seems to have slighted JFK.  His service was real, and costly.  Oldest brother Joe was a fighter pilot and killed in WWII.  JFK’s PT boat was sunk and he was severely injured, which affected him throughout life.
Kennedy’s were a mixed bag.  There was Joe and John, then there was Teddy.  Sigh….

                Joe Jr. was killed piloting a heavy bomber intended as an unpiloted bomb drone after crew bailed out — secret weapon. Not much came of the program, but he certainly was heavily invested, knowingly risked his life and lost it to mischance.JFK put his life on the line, yes, serving in a high risk mission. But I’n not sure he was “heroic”.  I understand his well connected father lobbied heavily for his award of the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for Valor.Not that I begrudge him that. If he kept his crew together and alive in hostile conditions, after allowing his boat to get rammed by a Japanese destroyer, well then, perhaps some recognition was warranted. There have certainly been countless more egregious cases of politicking for awards (or just writing them for yourself — John Kerry, reportedly). I’ve seen worse than the JFK award myself.But while he may have not been heroic, he certainly endured risk for the cause.

                    Heroic is meant to me as putting one’s life on the line in the war effort—as in undertaking a *real* chance of injury.  How that distinguishes one from any other casualty is another story.
I point out a couple of examples to distinguish one from those notables who “volunteered/served” with the understanding they’d never be put in harm’s way.  There were many of those.  LBJ was one good example.  Nixon less so, but he mostly played poker on a rear echelon ship (IIRC).

                Ted Kennedy was a different generation, the Silent Generation.  The boomers get a lot of grief, and they are terrible, but this was by far the worst generation.  The first wave of the pyramid scheme.  And nearly all of them will have checked out before seeing their handiwork in full iteration.   Does anyone really know of anyone born in the 1930’s who didn’t end up being terrible, selfish person?   Really vapid, even mean spirited  people in that crowd.  But they received the pinnacle of American power, education, etc.  They really did live at the top before destroying it all.

                    I take a little of that back.  Some of the smartest professors I had were from that generation.  Offices so filled with books you had to walk in sideways.

                The Kennedys have by turns been blessed and shat upon by Lady Fate, beyond all doubt. There’s even a relatively obscure pop song from 1985, Shona Laing’s “(Glad I’m Not) A Kennedy.” 🙁

        The big difference today is that the generation banging the rattle in the high chair has control over nuclear weapons.  Other generations had them, but also had some measure of self-restraint.  It’s hard to rebuild if your civilisation has been reduced to smoldering radioactive rubble.

        You can see this clearly on a small scale if you went to high school where half the kids went to Europe and the other half to Hawaii over the Summer…scratching your head that Tommy’s parents  bought him a third Acura after he crashed the first two.  As human beings, we have this need to feel struggle.  If this is taken away something is missing, and that person will go about creating their own struggles in life…drugs etc. (see Hunter).  The smarter parents would know that aspirational items are meant to be achieved.  This is where so much anarchy comes from.  If you meet anarchists, a huge bunch come from well off families.  If you have an elite (so called) that’s been coddled from day one (Pelosi was an entitled political mafia princess) they’ll do this to the whole country.  Their inner souls enjoy recklessly tearing down what others built.  They were born to consume and destroy.  All people are born to eventually die and all nations follow the same arc.  It’s those moments (exactly like this decade) that future generations study and hopefully glean insight as to the inner workings of human nature and its fallen state.  The French Revolution certainly had an impact on the 19th Century, and what exactly happens when elites don’t live up to their roles.

        It really is true that pretty much everyone who was born post WW2 hasn’t known much, if any privation – and has had all the luxuries that previous generations could only dream about – ubiquitous electricity, central heating/cooling, indoor plumbing, cars, air travel, tv, radio, computers, smart phones etc., etc.  And as someone has already mentioned, WAY too many have too much time to ponder and complain (let alone be outraged) about things that matter nothing in the long term scheme of things.  The unseriousness of our leadership and too many fellow citizens is there for all to see, if they wish.  Hard times, at least relatively speaking, look to be coming and it’ll most certainly separate the wheat from the chaff.

        I hope that someone has pointed out that Ronald Reagan did serve in the US Army. He was in the Reserves before the War and was an officer during the War. He served only in a motion picture unit, but that was perhaps where he was best suited to serve. Listen to some of those Army Pictorial Service home front propaganda pieces: Quite often it’s Ronald Reagan doing the narration.

            No argument here…but I’d add that some famous actors fought to get into the service.  Clark Gable insisted on being in combat and was a bomber door gunner.  Jimmy Steward was that years Best Actor, and when first rejected—too thin—went home and worked out the meet the minimum standards to be accepted.  He rose to Colonel and squadron commander in the Air Force—and still hopped on bombing missions when possible.
These were men of another generation.  We are all so gay today.

                    Yes, one should not forget some of our best, like Pat Tillman—who (IIRC) was making $7M per year at the time of 9/11 and simply gave it all up.
But I’d say it’s a game of numbers and those numbers seem less today, than in the past.  That may be a product of a corrupt leadership, or a soft life, or demographic change.

                        Tillman enlisted with high intentions. He was fatally shot by his own troops while shagging a female officer (a superior) in the bush. The event was publicly described to fit the hero narrative. The actual initial field records established an uglier, truer depiction but were, of course, suppressed and only partly disclosed because the shooters were subject to disciplinary measeures and their lawyers investigated the incident and aftermath. Tillman allegedly was hated by his fellow troopers as a prima donna who routinely violated orders, rules and regs such as fraternization prohibitions cavalierly. I’m not trying to throw shade on a dead guy who cannot defend himself. Tillman served and I merely almost did (preliminarily accepted USN OCS for flight training, rejected MEPS modest eyesight defect during glut of candidates, refused power school as subs antithetical to flight). But Tillman was not admired by those who served with him In fact, there is evidence he was set up to be “fragged” by his unit, which would be remarkable, indicative and exemplary of the b.s. aspect of conflict.

                Retired as a Brigadier and flew every heavy bomber from the B-17 to the B-52.John Ford has always been my favorite WWII.  Watch “Midway” sometime.  He spent most of the air raids outside the bunkers directing a terrified Navy film crew whilst every other person with common sense was burrowed in.  To the point where the command staff was dependending on him for sitreps since he was one of the few out and about the whole time.  Ended up full of shrapnel.  Later took footage at D-Day that was so horrific the general staff suppressed it from public view.  Impressive for a 50 year old Hollywood celebrity that had every excuse not to be there.

        A thought:  The numbers on Covid (if they’re believable which i don’t think they are) for the United States is awful.  We have the highest death toll of any country in the world if i remember correctly.  That alone should stop everything, bring a full investigation of the healthcare industry and .gov, which politicians do you here even mentioning this?  I don’t care if you’re “out of power” or whatever someone should be pounding the table day and night calling for an investigation of Healthcare due to placing last in the we won’t let our citizens die contest.

            We have the highest death toll because those in power wanted us to have the highest death toll. Those who died “with” covid (or with a positive test) far outnumber those who died from covid.  Juiced-up covid death totals fuel the mask-forever Karens and ensure perpetual cycles of lockdown, vaccines, and mail-in voting.  Meanwhile, China has had far less covid deaths than England.  Is that because Chinese health care is so superior, or because the party is suppressing the numbers by a factor of 1000?

                China and India each have over a billion people yet nowhere near as many deaths as us.  Now granted i don’t believe their numbers either.  Its been two years and i don’t know personally a single person who has died.  I had it back in August, it was funky, but never felt the need to go to the hospital.  And you’re going to fire me for not taking your experimental jab?  Which is by itself a long and strange story.  Sometimes i think the “News” is a non existent reality that i have no contact with, like watching the days of our lives.

        One of the unique twists to the situation we are faced with is that the rulers have convinced young White women (and some men) that the ruling class has a moral responsibility to dramatically lower the standard of living of the masses so that we don’t all die from climate change or the flu. Plus most uni educated  young White women think it is morally right for whites to be despised and discriminated against.So this economic downturn will be supported by most of the young Whites even though they will be angry that it is happening because they also feel entitled.What a mess. While the West is hampered by white women, the rest of the world will just go about their lives. There will be ups and downs for them but they won’t be intentionally creating the downs

            I know a particular white woman, not young, but a boomer, who is on Facebook nonstop advocating for BLM unbridled and mass immigration. She’s a retired “public servant” and lives in a city that’s 90-plus percent white.
Funny thing though. When the city made noises about putting up a low-income housing complex on the outskirts of her city, she was first in line to rally opposition against it.
All this to say, virtue-signaling may take a hit when it impacts these women directly.

                Many of us are familiar with people like that. I lost an older friend of thirty years because I publicly called out his progressive Juice wife who went apoplectic when the elite school their children attended announced vouchers for urban youths to enroll there. She took every measure conceivable to roll back the vouchers, including dirty tricks. A week prior, this woman had publicy unbraided non-Juice for merely questioning whether introducing urban youths to their own schools was intelligent.

                    There’s a special place in hell for these women.
I do have some sympathy for younger women though. Some of them don’t know any better. Thanks to the fiction peddled by news media, entertainment, and even our education system, far too many young women believe what they’ve been told regarding the joys of diversity.
It’s the experienced ones who deserve no mercy, the virtue-signaling loudmouths who know enough to realize they don’t want cultural enrichment for themselves but will gleefully force it on others, especially the kids of working-class whites.

Holy schmidt.  Now there was a guy watching the schmidt hit the fan.
Remember, in 1910, no one could imagine such a thing as a World War.  He was a young man in the effervescent optimism of the Gilded Age, when all the future seemed bright.

        I’d place the birth of the American Empire at the Spanish American War. The first generation would be those born post-Civil War during the period of the country’s great industrial and geographic expansion. The post-WW II generation would then be the fourth, possibly mimicking Strauss &amp; Howe’s Fourth Turning. Who’d be the eminence grise to lead the post-millenials into a new First Turning? Viktor Orban? Sandy Ocasio? Some woke figure from the metaverse? Or the long-awaited Apocalypse to put an end to that dreadful Francis Fukayama?

        “That last bit is what distinguishes the third imperial generation. They have no attachment to the system they inherited. It is just something that they were born into so they take it for granted.”I think the attachment, or perhaps interest, is why we go shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations. I’ve seen sports (NASCAR) literally do that (truly in three generations), and businesses do that in one or two. Heck, my best friend didn’t want to take over his father’s restaurant. Worked in it as a cook and said “nope, not for me”. The thing is you need the passion, interest, and drive to keep things running, and if you’re pampered and have cash coming in, what’s to concern yourself about?Until of course the cash stops coming in, and the family silverware ends up on eBay.It also doesn’t help that people want “glamorous, important” lives, and running a restaurant, even one that makes money hand over fist, puh-lease!The problem with corporations is they pass from the vision of the founder or founders to the financial guys and gals, who only know spreadsheets and how cheap can we make this to maximize profit?TL/DR, if you’re not invested in it, “it” withers on the vine as you chase your interests

            Readers Digest is a perfect case in point. Thirty years ago it was in the top five of the fortune 500 companies to work for in the U.S.. Good salaries, a beautiful campus to work at, great benefits, the staff in the cafeteria were all graduates of the Culinary Institute. employees had a choice at Christmas time; a bonus, or a turkey for dinner on Christmas Day. The owners wife was big into flowers and gardens and every May 1st, the employees were given the day off and encouraged to picnic on the grounds, which were loaded with flowers and trees that she brought in from all over the world. Then the founders died and less than five years later the money changers decided to take the company public and once they did, the party was over.Every thing I mentioned above was scrapped to keep the company from going into the red, to no avail. They even had to sell off the 300 million dollar collection of art the founders spent their life collecting. I don’t even think the company exists anymore.

                    You are most likely correct. To my dying day, that will be my favorite job. I make more now and have better benefits where I am, but the quality of the crew that I worked with was pretty special; it was like we knew each other all our lives, starting and finishing each others sentences, nobody tried to get over/backstab anyone else, we’d cover for each other if need be.and then one spring day it all came crashing down. They made cuts in our department which resulted in two of us being let go (I was one of them) and the rest were scattered to the four winds. Oh well, the good times don’t last forever. I’ll always cherish my memories there.

            To some extent I speak from experience. To a large degree, I am one of those pampered drones. I was born with, if you will, a silver-plated spoon in my mouth, although the spoon had turned to stainless steel by perhaps age 7.My full time working years numbered just about twenty. Both parents dead by the time  I turned 38, they left a small legacy but enough that I was able to retire in my early 40s. My Dad especially tried to interest me in some enterprises: rental real estate for example I was not interested, nor did I have the aptitude. Always having been on the idle side, and having no wife or children, nor especially desiring any, I asked myself why I would want to continue in a lackluster profession when I could enjoy life and basically do what I wanted? And so I did.None of the above is to brag, but just a statement of facts: I had most things handed to me. Not on a silver platter perhaps but I never lacked for any important thing, either. It probably takes a special type of offspring to carry on a family business, perhaps not just a go-getter, but a person who has to work to earn his bread. But even that presupposes having one to carry forward. And frankly, when all one’s needs are provided for, where’s the incentive to strive? Is it really any surprise that the children of the rich or successful usually are at best so-so, the next generation even more nondescript?I’m not a Kennedy-phile, but they are a textbook example of the law of entropy applied to a family dynasty. From a super-sucesessful patriarch, two two war heroes, two so-so career politicians, leaving a gaggle of third and forth generations now, with perhaps the most notable being an attorney advocating environmental and vaccine safety and such. With the odd rapist, murderer or drug addict along the way.

                That clan has “shot it’s wad” so to speak. I was reading something about the current generation of them, all in their 20’s and they have no class, or charm. Locals routinely complain about the fact that these kids walk into anywhere, go straight to the front of the line and pull the “Do you know who I am?” bit if they aren’t given immediate service. The article went on to state how during the summer months the locals can’t navigate the harbor due to the fact that a dozen or so of them will get loaded at the local pubs and then crash their boats into each other in the bay.

        The funny thing is our rulers don’t even sense how irrelevant they are becoming. They of course see themselves as the be all and do all of the country. This business in Ukraine is exactly on point. The U.S. has been left out of most of the negotiations that are going on. The Europeans are talking with the Russians solely about their interests, and Turkey, and Israel appear to be heavily involved with the ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine. The bottom line is once the provinces realize the Imperial Capitol is not needed, the final acts of the play are near.

        It has to get worse before it can get better.There has to be genuine pain and deprivation among the dirt people before Joe Normie will get his fat ass off the couch. And the faster we get to the bottom, the faster we can begin the rebirth. But here is the hardest truth. Talking does not make up stronger. Nor does voting. Nor does whining. Only a hardship gauntlet in the real world can force the sore muscles necessary to rebuild robustness. And not everyone will survive this gauntlet.That’s the big picture, but it does no good to head to the gym and pump weights if you’re sick with disease. You’ve got to rid yourself of the disease first and heal the body before starting down the gauntlet trail. That is where we find ourselves today. The disease is festering and metastasizing. DC is Hell bent on killing us financially, culturally, and very soon, genocidally. It will become do or die, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Time to get serious.

                Yes, your first obligation is to survive the collapse, and the best way to do that is to get out of the city. Trying to persuade others is wasted effort; they won’t wake up until reality forces them to do so. Lead by example, and if they follow, great, but don’t get your hopes up. Most folks are ruled by the Comfort First Imperative and this habit will not be broken easily. There is an important role for the canon fodder that takes to the streets in wild-eyed protest and wailing. They will keep the LEOs fully occupied and exhausted. And the best camouflage is the maddening crowd. Do not focus on negatives. Rather, find the positives and exploit them.

        It’s a matter of perspective.  My dad, his brother and an uncle were all Korea vets.  ALL my great uncles and one grandfather were WWII vets (the other grandfather was WWI—it wasn’t until I saw “They Shall Not Grow Old” that I viscerally understood why he never spoke of it). But what they all had from that experience was not simply “the war”, but a perspective  of what was existential and what wasn’t.  There wasn’t much hysteria in any of them over shit that didn’t matter.  They were serious people.  Now you see utter meltdowns over someone using the wrong pronoun or that a 6’3” guy who was male until a year ago is now the womens NCAA swimming champion.

            Agreed. Getting shot at (my father, my uncle) or having truly hard times (my mother’s family) focuses one’s mind on the things that are truly important in life.My mother’s side of the family was hit hard by The Great Depression. My grandfather lost his job, and being they lived in a little mining town out in the Eastern US, there was no work. You worked in the mine, or you sold things to miners and their families. No mine workers, no work. So her family bounced around from the East to the Midwest with my grandfather looking for work, where my grandmother would work as a maid or seamstress to bring cash in. My grandfather actually found steady work in Chicago in the late 1930s and could scrimp and save to buy a house. But it was tight times for them, and for a long while the little extra cash grandma could bring in was the difference between having some meat with their soup and bread for dinner and going without.My father’s family had it a little easier in that my grandfather kept his job through the Depression, but various family members lost their jobs and had to come crash with them, and bring their families, while pounding the pavement looking for a job. Granddad had enough cash to buy a two-flat so that having a renter added to  his income. But my father would admit times were tight with family dropping by looking for a roof over their heads. He told me there were times his father couldn’t spare a nickel for a candy bar or a quarter for the movies since he had to ration his money to cover extra family expenses.And then the war came, and my maternal uncle and my father got all expense paid trips to the UK, and continental Europe, care of Uncle Sam. Of course the Germans occupying continental Europe were none too happy my father and uncle showed up, and welcomed them with tank, artillery, and small arms fire.Dad got a Purple Heart, my Uncle was a POW.So yeah, a life like that and you don’t trifle them with “What Pronoun do I use today?”

                mmack:  I’m going to offer a slightly different perspective – not just in response to you, but after reading a number of previous comments about the seriousness of people who endured combat and/or hardship.  Yes, these people boiled things down to basics of survival (if you have a roof over your head, clothes to wear, and food in your belly then you have nothing to complain about) but, at the same time, focused almost exclusively on those things and so lost the bigger picture of what makes life worth living, as opposed to merely surviving.  Obviously I’m painting with a broad brush here, but I certainly remember that attitude from my silent parents – what on earth could I possibly have to complain about, given that I lived in what they considered material abundance.Again obviously, it’s futile to discuss philosophical issues with people who need to be fed, but I think they dismissed concerns about overall cultural values and a sense of purpose in life.  This is partially because they benefited from that solid White culture (many of them and their parents were formed under benevolent pressure to fully ‘assimilate’) and organized religion.  When the usual elements began to gnaw away and then openly oppose these things, they either claimed they were merely spoiled children, or that any concern about life when the fundamentals were fulfilled was merely entitled whining.I’m getting verbose here and I’m not sure I’m getting my point across clearly, but many of us here have noted we’d rather pay more for ‘x’ if it was manufactured in America by genuine Americans.   There needs to be a balance beyond the material minimum.  If that minimum is truly threatened here (genuine hardship and hunger as opposed to one’s favorite frozen latte unavailable) we may see some changes.  If things merely gradually erode and people’s expectations are reduced simultaneously, then it’s the Brazil route rather than the crash/war route.

                One of the few things he kept was a regimental picture taken in early 1918 before they left for France.  Keep it hung over my desk. In an example of how “small” history can be, it’s taken at Camp Forrest in Chickamauga Park.  Training camp was named after the Confederate general that captured his paternal grandfather at Thompson’s Station in early ‘63 and they are formed up 200 yards from where his maternal grandfather’s regiment was posted under Gen. Thomas during the battle of Chickamauga.

        “A new generation of builders will rise up, create a new civilization and the cycle will begin anew.”I sure as hell hope so, but I’m not terribly sanguine when I see some of the Generation Z kids.I realize that older generations have been bitching about young kids practically forever, but sometimes it really IS warranted. A little over ten years ago, roughly coinciding with the Obama years, I noticed a palpable change in college students. There have always been bad or indifferent students, of course, but the ones who grew up with cell phones and single moms were a different animal altogether — disinterested, unmotivated, surly, fat, entitled, radically egalitarian on racial and sexual matters, and literally unable to go thirty seconds without finger-fucking a smartphone. In the past, students were at least willing to wing it with the “old college try” and at least fake being interested or take some notes. Not any more. Try lecturing on James Madison to a 20-year-old 300-lb girl with purple hair dressed in pajamas clutching a cell phone who showed up 30 minutes late to a 50-minute class at community college sometime and let me know how it goes. And when you fail her because she has a 50% attendance rate and because the highest of her four exam grades was a 48 and even the curve couldn’t give her a D, she’ll go the chair and bitch that you weren’t “fair” or you didn’t give extra credit. Oh, and by the way, she has ADD and is “learning disabled” and was given special help and extra time to take the exams.And God help you if she is black or bisexual or transgender.Maybe I have just become an old crank, but I don’t see the up-and-coming lumpenproletariat rebuilding anything any time soon.

                Doesn’t make a difference. I’m familiar with State flagship U’s and about the same thing. Admissions for the most part has abandoned standardized testings.
It is admission people with similiar thinking as Ketanji Brown Jackson fabricating the holistic context to justify placing the brown overweight tranny before the accomplished white or asian.

                It’s because there are too many students in college/university!  There are perhaps at most 20% of the cohort (18-25) with the intellect to make good use of the institution—at least the institution as I went through.
These students are unmotivated because they are majoring in soft/pseudo disciplines and simply waiting to be “credentialed” so they can claim access to white collar jobs, hence we have AOC types that get “degrees” in economics and are employed as baristas.

                    Below Ground Solar StillA below ground solar still is a modified version of the same concept shown above.We are using the sun to extract water from non-toxic plants. Dig a bowl-shaped hole in a sunny spot. Create a sump, a reservoir or receptacle for liquids, in the center of the hole that is large enough to hold the container you want to use to capture the water. Place clean, non-toxic, green plant material in the pit.Cover the entire pit with a sheet of clear plastic and secure the edges to prevent the plastic from moving. Indent the center of the plastic by placing a rock or heavy object in the center just above the container in the bottom of the pit.Condensation will soon begin to build up on the plastic. The shape of the still forces the condensation to collect in the container at the base of the pit.

                    Wild Geese:  A lot of freeze-dried stuff is the equivalent of starch-heavy casseroles.  Although more expensive,   I would suggest looking into freezedrywholesalers.com.  They make LRP meals and midrats for the military, and sell both cooked and uncooked actual meat (steak, pork chops, sea food, etc.) and various vegetables.  Prices recently went up and many things may be sold out.Haven’t tasted what I’ve got but the meat looks like the real thing, and I’ve read it tastes that way too.Supplement that with cheap beans and rice, rather than buying the overpriced packaged meals.

                    Water shortages shouldn’t be the limiting factor. Farms run out of water long before homes do. I keep about 30 gallons stored only because I live in urban earthquake country.
Depending on your needs, a couple jerry cans plus a hiking filter is a very reasonable water supply.

                I’m from farm people so have always kept well more than we need on hand, but last couple years have been more structured about it.  Tier 1–rotational stock of things you use frequently in normal consumption and accumulating gradually means you are not tossing expired items.  But basically a month+ supply Tier  2-longer storage staples with 3+ year shelf life-grains, canned meats, dried vegetables (the Apocalypse will feature a lot of stew) Tier 3– freeze dried shit that I may have to will to my children.  But very compact and portable.  I know enough about farming to know this fertilizer/fuel + fields out of production problem could turn into a slow rolling snowball.

                    I regularly monitor the auction sites in my area, and for the last 6 months or so, several large key players in my area have given up farming, mostly because they are priced out regarding seed, fuel, and fertilizer, or because the old man died of covid and the wife cannot continue alone, or they just decided it wasn’t worth the aggro and want to retire while they still can. They have auctioned off all their farm equipment which means no one else will be taking over and farming on that land so that land is now out of production. These are alfalfa hay farms, cattle ranches, dairy cows, potato, onion, sugar beet, and cow corn farmers. This ain’t gonna end well folks..I am buying frozen turkeys now while they are on sale for Easter dinner making, because this Thanksgiving there may not be any available.

                    SamlAdams:  One of my husband’s old customers had stocked up for Y2K – a lot of his provisions really did time out and need to be tossed.  And although he bought land and restarted farming in addition to his other businesses, his financially comfortable children and grandchildren have pretty much abandoned that.  There’ve been a number of divorces and most choose not to home school, either.  Really nice people, but sad to see such a change in one – two generations.  Come to think of it, they almost epitomize what Zman describes.Your 3 tier comment is a succinct analysis of the best general system.  I read of people packing away 200 pounds of rice or buying flat after flat of spam.  The goal, at least as I perceive it, is not to store food for everyone for years on end.  It’s to ensure you have enough not to have to run to the store in an emergency, or to feed your family in a time of shortages (6-18 months).  If such shortages look to persist, the cost and space of trying to store sufficient provisions becomes prohibitive.  The point then is to start growing your own.

I am married with two kids, work as a software developer, bought a farm in a rural area, teach my children hard work, homeschool and the christian faith.There are barely any other children they can relate to.  I might see a few components of what we believe in other children, but thats about it.  We have contemplated moving as I have no idea how they can connect to others and build friendships and marry.On another note, why spend money on these pre-prepared foods? Buy rice and beans or whatever you might regularly eat that can be stockpiled.  I have seen a few people blow money on preps only to not be able to pay bills.

            They might be young, but you’re looking at dinosaurs, and I’d guess they won’t be around to build jack.
With that said, many of us had bad attitudes. I still do lol. The hope with them— and it’s a long shot— is that accelerationism is the new youth rebellion.
I’d still bet you’re looking at dinosaurs, though.

                Young people today are so screwed up, I think most of them don’t even have the foundation to sort out right and wrong for themselves. So much of this woke crap, I suspect, is them lashing out helplessly. They have a sense that it shouldn’t be this way, but they don’t know why or what to do about it. The zombie apocalypse meme is dead on.

            Y’know, I admire the dissidents but we sit here and point fingers. We point them at the boomers, the zoomers, the neolibs, the degenerates and perverts…and we very, very carefully avoid looking at ourselves in all this.You were a teacher, X. It was YOUR job to lecture that student – and you let her get away with it when she gets up on her high horse and lectures YOU. Not to rag on you – if you had stood up and actually did something about it, you’d have no support from your peers. I get it. But until you are willing to stand up – how can you ask the kids to? Chit like this is not on YOU… but it very much is on US. All of us.

                This seems like the right wing version of “a climate of hate killed JFK”I get the sentiment but Im not sure how anyone proposed to influence the larger situation in any way.If I was E Musk or Putin or some other world historical figure MAYBE I could influence things a bit, although theyre trying damned hard to bring even them to heel.  If youre a regular person and somehow even raising your kids right and not joining the Moloch parades youre doing about all you can.  People here lost friends, family, and jobs over the shot or not supporting the current current thing.  What do you propose people who are not professional political operatives do to “stand up” beyond all this?

        “That last bit is what distinguishes the third imperial generation. They have no attachment to the system they inherited.”I’d argue that they’re plenty attached to power over the system, if not the system itself. The system has been hollowed out and exploited; the rules have been tossed to the wind. The problem for the 3rd Imperial Generation is maintaining the farce.The Romans of old gave the mob bread, circuses, public works and the spectacle of their enemies dragged behind chariots. They at least pretended to serve the glory of Rome. The 3rd Generation blatantly serves itself, destroys the very concept of a polity by importing barbarians, wages war in distant lands for no reason and drags white guys behind its chariots.

            It is striking how different our ruling class is to Rome’s in her decline.  The degeneracy and fecklessness are still there, but at least Romans didn’t apologize for being Roman.I suspect a number of factors are at play here, including, but not limited to, the formation of early America from an amalgam of many different NW European ethnic groups who conquered ‘virgin’ territory (rather than Rome’s emergence in an already crowded European context), the pressures of incomplete assimilation from the second wave of immigration in the late 1800s and early 1900s, a tendency toward egalitarianism and an almost insatiable appetite for novelty and exploration that became stifled once the West was won. And then there is good old-fashioned Yankee monomaniacal virtue-signaling.  God save us.

                The utopian ethic of the north was incompatible with the multiracial reality of the south. North conquered south but the south got their revenge as diversity demoralized the north. Thus weakened, America has, at least in spirit and in reality I’d argue, been reconquered. Little more than colonies once again imo.

            Our host and the latch-key, Gen-X generation will accept the slings and arrows from the Boomer’s grandchildren.We have spent our whole working career preparing for:1.  Social security benefits: $0.002.  Medicare benefits: $0.003.  Pension : $0.00; and,4.  Being blamed for everything.Gen-X’ers are vastly outnumbered, so we can’t vote our way out of things.When I take stock of my savings and liabilities, I laugh when I tack on all of the six-figure teacher/ police/ firefighter/ dog catcher and IRS pensions (&amp; health benefits) I’ll also be expected to pay.  I wish them well.

                Gen  X is the last half-sane generation; not coincidentally the last to have any memories of an analog world.
Most Gen Xers are pretty solid people, but it was the WOMEN that were the problem.  This the generation where the white women went full resting bitch face/careerist/liberal.
The brittle bitches were cold and unapproachable.  GenX is where the incel was born.
So many problems solved/averted if women just stayed home and had kids.

And why it is thought to be a generational problem, which is ain’t, rather than a cultural problem, which it is.

                    Look, man. The decisions the Boomers made and the reasons behind those decisions have been a complete catastrophe for the American people. Just own it.
Not that shifting blame for literally everything is a Boomer stereotype.

            Z is 56, I believe.   I am not sure when his birthday is but he was born no later than 1966, perhaps even 1965.   I have seen the Boomer generation defined as 1946 to 1965 or maybe 64.  Not a lot of difference.I am a late age boomer.  As discussed before, very little in common with the classic boomer.  Came of age in the 70s and remember the oil shocks and ensuing recessions of the mid to late 70s.  Carter’s stagflation and all that.  It was a pessimistic time with crappy music and crappy looking people with long shaggy hair.  Nothing in common with the Woodstock people.  Generational hate can be fun but it’s also kind of silly.

When the little coffee cup icon on the lower right of the screen changes to a birthday cake icon and he asks for $10 instead of $5, you’ll know. 😉

            Dont really get the generational hate either.  An awful lot of people were badly raised, misinformed, and powerless.  A significant number resisted the (((culture))) even so.
If generation n is bad then generation n-1 screwed up raising them if nothing more.  Since childrearing is the most important function of society this means generation n-2 screwed up too… etc

        Many years ago I witnessed one of my great aunts (greatest/ lost generation) smack down her boomer daughter. The daughter was a classic boomer liberal that had been radicalized at college in the 60’s. The boomer made the statement that poverty was the cause of crime. My  great aunt, that, in her youth, had taught in a rural “one room” schoolhouse, explained that her White sharecropper kids that came to school in the winter with no shoes, not only never committed crimes, but went on to lead fairly successful lives despite the poverty of their youth.The boomer daughter didn’t get it. She’d never seen it.

            Boy that is spot on.  Can’t tell you how many arguments I’ve gotten into around here over that one.  My family is old “Midwest/Appalachian”—that’s the KY/southern Ohio/Indiana belt, with a few TN/KY hill people thrown in.  None (that I know of) felt compelled to become criminals.  Remember visiting the one room schoolhouse built after the Civil War where my g-grandfather and grandfather went (still have some of their schoolbooks).  Somehow they managed to avoid being criminals and were successful farmers despite little formal education.

            I’m at least partially siding with the Boomer. Where she makes the mistake is messing up cause and effect.  The same thing that makes people poor makes them criminals and violent. Your great aunt didn’t have to deal with violent kids who didn’t want to be there.  You could drop out of school in the 6th grade.   The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.  Though there is a reversion to the mean which means that some children of poor people will find success in their life.We shouldn’t forget that “education” has become a magical fix for everything.  There is so much magical thinking going on in “education” that we have essentially destroyed it by handing out diplomas like they are a magical talisman which fixes all problems. We even send retarded people to school. We even have memes about how wrong-thinkers just need more “education.”

        I like the “green shoots” and “white pills,” (and think they’re merited and not Pollyannaish), but how do you rebuild Western civilization with the global south not only rushing for the north, but large portions of it already entrenched here?Chomsky is a nut, but he is correct that East and West are far less relevant than northern hemisphere versus southern hemisphere.Repatriation for nonnatives and natal incentives for natives would be a good start, but it can only start after the people in charge either die of old age, retire, or are forced out or killed (not advocating or fedposting, just listing the hypotheticals). And that only takes care of the “will” portion. Then the “way” has to be cleared, and, if those in need of expulsion refuse to go, you’ll have something like a mix of German cleansing of Byelorussia and house-to-house clearing operations in Iraq.That’s a lot of work, and a lot of bloodshed, but I suppose it’s just the kind of winnowing fire that would leave only those who “pack the gear to live in my beloved America,” to paraphrase R. Lee Ermy.I still think that leftism is a much bigger problem than minorities. No left, and then Hispanics and even (American) blacks become manageable. We have a couple centuries’ worth of evidence to prove it.

            “No left, and then Hispanics and even (American) blacks become manageable.”No chance.  The genie is out of the bottle and there is no putting it back in.  You may have had hope for older black groups stations, but the newer ones are raised to believe their plight is solely based in “racism” and has nothing to do with their genetic makeup or culture.  Do not underestimate the power of embraced victimhood.Even so, removing the left is a pipe dream that will never be realized.  It’s pie in the sky.  Throughout American history the country has moved further and further left all the while Americans are being bread out.The only real possibility I see for the USA is a Balkanized land mass with regional governments and separate cultures.  Possibly ruled by China.  It is interesting, yet depressing, to ponder.

Alas, I can’t even blame my typos on a phone, so you’re far ahead of me. Plus, it’s nice to see commenters able to laugh at these little foibles.
It’s just one more reason why this comment section is among the best on the internet.

Blacks are easy to control. The problem today is that the PTB lack the will, and those who have the will lack the opportunity b/c the PTB have withdrawn the opportunity.
Remove the PTB and you will see.

                    Yup, the “Red Dawn” scenario is possible, but I say it largely tongue-in-cheek.
We have had 1 to 3 million fighting age males per year coming, to the point they now mix with the “general population.”
The invaders won’t be Chinese.  The Contras are already here, being organized on a political level, and now facing stiff competition from the Ghurkas.

            Leftism is a problem, but it can’t be faced with the demographic nightmare we have now. As for cleansing house-to-house, come on. You establish that immigrants with fewer than x generations born in the US are not Americans at all, and can’t vote or own property. You provide financial incentives for them to re-patriate and financial disincentives for them to remain in the US.

            Wild Geese: I mentioned, I think last week, that my electricity costs were project for a 54% increase. This is doubly concerning because our entire house is run on electric – no gas.I don’t know whatexactlyis causing this, perhaps the Ukraine situation, maybe something else, but it’s worth noting that:1) Electricity is subject to VAT.2) The energy companies pay various ‘green’ taxes which subsidise various government sham schemes.3) Whilst these taxes are levied on the companies, they can be – like all tax – transferred to the customer.In the end, it does not matter. The fact is my bill is going to be vastly more expensive.Of course, petrol has gone up. Now, the statecouldhelp here, seeing that the bulk of the petrol price is a duty paid to it. But with our debt and deficits, they need all the cash they can get… Nice to dream though!

                I would expect a further 50% in the autumn at least.
The goal is an obvious de-industrialization of Europe and then somehow manage (offer a new solution) for the collapse.
Coal is not just energy. It will also halt the European steel industry (mainly German) which then acts as yet another downstream shortage for all derivatives of this.

                    They don’t use coal anymore to create steel. They make it with oil.  I forget what it’s (the oil-made replacement) called, but most steel  is made without anthracite these days. Anthracite is expensive and no longer plentiful.

                        Seems the world coal and steel site sees coke is still a major component.
http://www.worldcoal.org/coal-facts/coal-steel/
And euro-coal:
euracoal.eu/info/country-profiles/germany/
“In 2018, the German hard coal market amounted to 48.7 Mtce, of which 27.2 Mtce were used for power and heat generation, while 20.4 Mtce were consumed by the steel industry.  The remaining 1.1 Mtce were sold to the residential heating market.”
So it looks like 45% is used for steel production.

I was specifically talking about Germany.
So losing 20  Mtce of input is going to end the industry.
Loss of 70k direct jobs, then all the downstream jobs and items from no German steel across Europe.

The market was trying to reset but the powers that be intervened.  Some of us have been watching for the crack up boom since then.  Which led to very strong initial skepticism about covid.  Remember every economic problem since 2020 is “because” covid, so deflecting from responsibility as usual, but they’re also using covid to front run the dissolution of the system.  Nothing currently is being blamed on asshat (politicians, CEOS) managers that we have, it was all covid and now Ukraine.  And when the final bell tolls for our fake economy they’ll say who  could have seen it coming and will force a new system on everyone in which they will remain in charge.  Power, the power to dictate to others is all that matters.  Look at everything thru that lens and many things begin to make sense.

Its one thing to wish for some kind of reform or restructuring or that different people get in charge or even a lot of people get expropriated or even executed…but a lot of this wishful talk ablut collapse is simply madness or delusion.

                I’m not convinced Bucha is emotionally-loaded enough to get the Karens shrieking for official declaration of WW3.
They needed something on the level of the Turkish child on the beach and this was not that.
My hypothesis is that the plotters were so lazy and incompetent they thought this would do the trick. They may have also misread the mood of the US.
The alternative is that the Russians had intelligence about their main horror op and stomped it, forcing them to go with this B-team effort.

                    I agree it was either or this or the chmical false flag.
They ran both side by side for a while to prep the field.
I suppose we should be thankful they did not do plan A quite yet.
I expect them to ramp this up with a couple of more staged events.
Russia seemed to think that if they were careful in how they waged war, it would cause fewer issues.
The reality seems to be that the longer they are careful, the more fake BS is created for the frame up.

                        I think Russia has correctly determined that the hellmouth is going to say whatever it wishes and that reality does not limit it in any way anymore.The whole world just stopped in place for years because the hellmouth told us about a deadly pandemic that every humab being could easily see was fiction.Do we really think they cant launch an economic or kinetic war over completely whole cloth incidents?Remember that we were supposed to believe Russia is our enemy because they stole the 2016 election with pee blackmail or whatever.That was before the 81 million votes.Russia is pursuing its own material interests and just accepts the shrieking.  If their hard power deterrent doesnt preserve their security nothing else will matter.

        “They at least understood the enormous cost to their ancestors and appreciated it.”Yes, I’d be inclined to agree here. And appreciating the cost seems to become even harder for the current generation when they are not justtemporallyremoved from their ancestors, but materially as well.My great grandmother died in the early 2000s and was born when Queen Victoria was still on the throne: what an incredible change she would have witness in her lifetime. My childhood and hers, completely different – mainly in the material way.Could such a material gap have existed between us if she had been born in 1699 and died in 1701? I don’t think so. Whilst the temporal gap between us is the same, the type of life we led, the material comforts we were born into perhaps had a greater likelihood of being the same.I think this helps the entitled attitude of so many modern people along. That, and the way our culture dumps on our ancestors.

            I assume you meant 1699 to 1801 and no, the world changed much less for the average person in that period than it did between 1899 and 2000.  Even going from 1799 to 1901 the big change would have been railroad travel.  Your local community in most outside some cities like New York still would have been made up of the descendants of the people you grew up with.

                    True, some homes would have had electricity and most would have had indoor plumbing by 1901.  Those changes would have seemed normal and natural life improvements.  There is no comparison to say someone born in 1919 and dying in 2020 wondering why everyone stares at screens all day and healthy people were terrified of Covid.  They would still recognize the countries and communities they lived in though.

No. The rural population did not drop below 50% until 1920 (Census, so *around* 1920). So “most” homes did not have indoor plumbing in 1901.
The REA was passed only in 1936, and many rural areas were still not electrified in 1950.

            A man born in 1699 could have handed down all of his tools (collected across the course of his life) to his great grand children in 1801.  Very little changed for average folks between those 2 dates.  The man born in 1699 would have learned to read the Bible by candlelight in the evening, or maybe the summer when it was light later.  The great grandson born in 1799 would also learn to read the Bible by candlelight or maybe in the summer.  When I was a boy, my father still had a lot of hand tools no longer in use today, like manual drills and saws. (OK, you can still find hand saws around, but not those push or spin drills and wooden tape measures) He also had a slide rule he used in college. If you handed me a slide-rule, I wouldn’t know what it was. We were only born 33 years apart.

                “We were only born 33 years apart.”Ditto every single word, except that I do know what a slide rule is. (And so do you.) And my father was 30 when I was born.He was a bombardier on a B24 in the Pacific, and he used his slide rule for calculations in that. And he never missed a single target, whether in training or in combat.In the late 90s, somebody–a brewery as I recall–took a B24 around the country as a PR stunt. When my father and mother and my sister and I went to see it when it came to our town, I saw my father shed tears for the first and only time in my life. Not boo-hooing, but shining eyes and a profound silence.The only things he ever spoke about were his buddies and where they were from and what they were like, and the city of Nagasaki as it appeared when he passed through it in September 1945.

My dad was in high school in the early 50s and college in the late 50s.When I was in junior high the watches with calculators were just starting to become widespread (fad) and cheap enough for 12 year olds to have them.  I still have my scientific calculator from college.  I recently saw a calculator with most of the functions of this one in a dollar store.

                    I graduated high school in 1980. My parents gave me a Texas Instruments Model 59 programmable calculator to replace the slide rule I’d received from a great uncle. The calculator cost about what cheap laptop would today. Learning to program it was actually more difficult than using the slide rule; so I quickly grew bored with the TI.

                    That was my year, also.  I used a slide rule my first 2 years (I think) of college.  I believe I got a TI calculator my sophomore or junior year, though I remember all the real nerds got an HP.  Seems as if I paid about $120.  I still use a TI Business Analyst.  They last forever.

                “He also had a slide rule he used in college. If you handed me a slide-rule, I wouldn’t know what it was.”
Getting my Pilot’s License in the 1990s I was handed an E6B Calculator, which is a “circular slide rule” used for wind correction angles, fuel consumption, etc. I still have it in my long unused flight bag. And I am sure there’s an app for your phone that replaced it.

        “ That last bit is what distinguishes the third imperial generation. They have no attachment to the system they inherited. It is just something that they were born into so they take it for granted. ”
To be fair to the outliers in that generation, the problem is not just entitlement and profligacy.
The ones doing the damage claim a kind of moral superiority and attack the few remaining builders.

Yeah, that might be one way to put it.
I think that they think (or did before they got old and rich from graft) that they are the generation that has made–or will make–America “fulfill her true promise,” or something equally juvenile and unrealistic.
But, yeah, you could say that in that sense they think they are the builders–at least the “true” builders.

            The same thing is happening in Turkey though. The Turks are being outbred by the Kurds and other darker, less intelligent groups. They also have millions of Arab refugees.
All around the globe, the productive/semi productive people are being outbred by the parasites. It’s more pronounced in the West because of mass immigration speeding up the process.

                Well, the reason that the Turks are able to have a fairly competitive international economy is due to the segment of their population that is of European descent. I guess it’s a bit like Brazil.
I’ve known a few and they are pretty sharp people. Unfortunately, they tend to buy into all the Western woke junk.

            Yep. The West existed because of the biology of its people. The West – as known for 1,000 years – will not exist in North America or much of Europe in 50 years.
Brazil is not the West. Turkey is not the West.
If the West is to survive, it will require one or several groups of whites to separate from or carve out a place within the coming multi-everything societies that will emerge.

                Citizen:  Spot on as usual.  Turkey is fascinating, Istanbul is beautiful, and both the ancient Christian and Muslim architecture is incredible, but it is a profoundly un-western society.  I’ve never been to Brazil, but German immigrant pockets regardless, it’s still majority mestizo.  Again, not the White Christian west.
Everything I love and value is of the west.  Please God may it and its White creators survive and thrive somewhere, somehow.  And may I help that be achieved in any small way possible.

            Here’s a slight white pill for all you spouting the inevitability of white demographic decline because of being outbred by the Southern Hemisphere. There’s a factor you’re all not considering. The enormous migration and population growth, specifically in Africa, is an entirely artificial creation of the west. The west allowing migrants to immigrate into their countries, as well as untold billions/trillions in monetary and food aide to those countries has allowed the population growth. Without these factors, those countries would have plateaued many millions ago. Thus, when SHTF, and that aide dries up, and populations start protecting their lands, you’ll see stabilization. Not to mention the fact that when the free money gravy train dries up, many of these people will move on to their next mark or go home.

                Thank you, Greek. I often make exactly that point here and elsewhere. Of course mass migration is a factor, but even if it weren’t, few people realize the enormous dependence of much of the Turd World, especially basket case like Africa, to not only technology but the continual support of money, resources and other inputs. I suspect that long term the continuing support, let alone the population booms in these fertile lands, is supportable, except perhaps absent some miracle of technology akin the the Green Revolution. Perhaps it’s inevitable that there will be “Peak People” and then a die-off. It may not be humanity’s end, but surely it will be a horror on a scale never seen in history. I suspect in the more dire scenarios, hitting the Georgia Guidestones target of 500,000 global population is entirely a reasonable target.

        Yep.  Ukraine lost the war weeks ago.  Now they suffer because the western puppet refuses to do the adult thing and negotiate a stop to the war.
I still go by John Glubb’s 10-generation cycle and mark the beginning as the end of the Revolution – which means we are at the end.  We are so far into the age of decadence, dreed, and frivolity that Glubb’s essay written 45 years ago sounds almost like prophesy, not just astute historical observation.

The collapse is well advanced. It’s what some people call “a slow-motion train wreck.”
But by whatever name, it is well advanced.

                    Rome, Golden Age Arabia or Ancient Greece never got to the ‘a girl can be a real man’ phase or the radical hatred of their own civilization. This suggests our collapse should have happened around yr 2000 and we are in new territory. Because we have more affluence than ever before and financial wizards keeping the money flowing in the face of debt like never seen before. We’re long overdue for collapse, it’s happening slow-mo. And all the while the demographic situation is deteriorating.

                        The shift from hard war (weapons) to soft war (psychological) may have altered the pattern here.  The presence of nuclear weapons makes  full scale hard war seem daunting to all but our maniacal leaders.  Instead, our people are crushed psychologically, which yields the desired results.

        I see green shoots here and there among the ashes. The home schooling movement is rapidly growing, which signals profound unease over public institutions. In fact, alternative systems are rising up in the midst of our medical/industrial complex. It’s happening with websites like this one. And, except for the elderly stuck in legacy media, attitudes about who or what to trust are also undergoing swift change. Keep your eye on the adventures of the US dollar for more indications.

            “Keep your eye on the adventures of the US dollar for more indications.”Heh. If you ever want to know the real measure of the government, then monitoring it’s monetary and taxation policies are good ways to discern the (rough) truth.I upvoted you for the white pill. I too, see green shoots. Starting with this website as an example, I have referred a small number of people over the years I’ve been reading here. Small, but the message is spreading.Again with this site, the commentariat are the best that I’ve seen on any forum; mainly because we seem to keep large amounts of swearing and crudity at bay, and people know how to turn caps-lock off. Further, when you read these comments, there’s a lot of insight: yesterday’s Bretton Woods piece was an education for me. We’ve got programmers, engineers, military men, medical people… loads. Funny thing is, Z’s site is ‘hate speech’; but I’ve paraphrased comments from here to tonnes of folks, and they at least have a think over the statement.In the real world the price hikes are going to force people to look at reality a bit more carefully. People concerned about electricity prices are mentioning wood-burning stoves to me. A fellow will listen if I tell him that he ought to prepare by cutting down on luxuries. Many folksdoseem to get that what they took for granted just half a decade ago isn’t coming back.Of course, the Legacy MSM are pumping out their propaganda – but it is important to understand that when we say “It’s hopeless, they control everything related to the media.”, whilst true, doesn’t mean many are listening. They’re certainly not where I am; well, amongst certain age groups.The future is going to be hard, but our types aren’t the sort that sit back swilling lattes and getting angry that our Liberal Arts degree didn’t get a job. We’ve got a premium on practical skills… and people are going to need those now and in the future.

            As I said in the post, you can get bogged down in the definitions. The better way to think of generations in this context is as phases. The building phase could be several generations. The maintenance phase could be centuries in the case of the Roman empire. Ditto the decline phase. The current generations of rulers spans the current generations. AOC is a product of decline, yet she is a fetus.

            Keep in mind that the dumbest people go into politics and media these days. There’s still a truly smart set, they’re just in finance, IT, and some sciences. The USA will go down a few rungs in the traditional sense of world-bestriding empire, but as we’ve talked about it in these pages, the centers of power will shift elsewhere.

                The people who go into politics are not dumb.  They may not be smart in traditional subjects, but have a very peculiar social cunning.  They are experts at being popular and manipulating others.
It reminds me of a few individuals in High school who were neither good at sports, nor particularly good looking, or had any other special talent other than the ability make friends with all the other popular kids.
Politics is the perfect playground for the intellectually vacuous hard core social climbers.
