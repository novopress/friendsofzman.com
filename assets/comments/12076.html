        At some point Mr Z, it might be helpful to compare what you think are meaningful generational criteria compared to the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù categories.
If you look at the pre-20th C trusts and estates, they often didn‚Äôt settle on the beneficiary until they reached the age of 23-25, when reason and sensible agency could be assumed.- very different from today.

        Hope you come back in good spirits.  Keep in mind that a vital element of your blog is to set the table for a good discussion among the commenters, and on that score, you have been hitting it out of the park lately.
I don‚Äôt know how much moderating you do on the discussions, but if you are doing so, it is invisible to me.  That‚Äôs a good thing.

        Z-
I just want to say what a pleasure it‚Äôs been being an observer of, and unpaid consumer of, your burgeoning media empire. You are a light among us, and I appreciate all you do.
Have a spectacular time off, and a world-class Thanksgiving, because, like you (from what I gather) I too believe there is much to work towards,  and be thankful for, in this great land, and, like you, I sense we still have a shot.
Keep it up, brother.

        I think the reason people put up with the economic backstabbiness of the Republicans was that relative to their cultural interests the other choice was somewhat more offensive to them. And the economy was still good enough that as long as they were comfortable, they were willing to get screwed by the lesser of the evils. But those comfortable days have gone away and it‚Äôs about needing work, shelter and food and the Republicans are just incapable of handling these much more serious issues. And the more they dither and delay the angrier their constituency gets. Corker was one of the smarter ones, pressed the stop button on the bus and got off it.I sense that Bannon thinks they can be reformed. I disagree with that opinion, and I‚Äôm done with either party and perhaps with voting altogether.

            The only reason I will vote GOP this time is the Democrats have let the mask slip, and are an open radical Left party. Their voters are crazy, individually and collectively, and they will try to punish their opponents any way they can if they regain majorities.
Have a good Thanksgiving, Z Man.

        Well glad to hear you‚Äôre going to stop picking on the Finns or at least give them a break. üôÇ  Being a second cousin to the  Suomalainen Heimo ( Finland Tribe  ) I would best describe Finland as ‚Äù Planet Vulcan ‚Äú.Cold , stoic, calculating, logic . . . . Until alcohol is introduced hence the beer pong study üòâAs always enjoy your intellectual approach to the PC madness around us, our dwindling numbers, the call to arms and a sense of humor as well.Happy Thanksgiving and enjoy that much-needed time off.All the best to you and yours.

        Sorry to be late to the show but I have been mulling over the podcast. When it comes to the convoluted reasoning for boys attraction to the same types as their mother there is surely a simpler reason. At least on average, their fathers were strongly attracted to their mothers type. Surely boys are likely to inherit this attraction. Of course this is an anathema to ‚Äòblank slate‚Äô lefties.
