        You wrote “..someone in the administration sees the problem and the risk of such an approach. ….it appears Obama never actually signed an executive order, …. Instead, he ordered DHS to issue a memorandum.”But I would remind everyone that the Judiciary is not part of any administration, it’s a co-equal branch of the government. I doubt anyone in this administration sees Obama’s actions as risky or irresponsible.It should also be obvious that, although Executive Orders have become a legal means of enacting policy, it is not legitimate for DHS to issue memorandums .. that would be expropriating and usurping Congress’s sole authority to create law.

        It is all too obvious  teh won is not the architect of his schemes.  He is an intellectual lightweight and certainly no legal scholar. Who is really running this show?  I’m sure ValJar has huge influence but who are the nuts and bolts guys/gals giving him the ammunition?  Do we have names? It seems he is only interested in pushing boundaries, not playing within the lines. He can’t compromise or reach out to the opposition even to make headway for his own agenda. It just seems odd that a President would want to be remembered as one who could not follow the course prescribed by the Constitution and rather be remembered as ineffective and an abuser of the process.  I guess that’s one of many reasons I’m not President
