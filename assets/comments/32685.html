        It is funny to compare media now with how they used to be. Had this happened 30 years ago, Sam Donaldson, who was a total liberal hack, would have been chasing the city manager of Springfield to his car, demanding to know what he was going to do about citizens concerns.  Now, they just repeat what the politicians tell them, without even consider the possibility they are lying.  The media as still terrible then, but wouldn’t have been able to resist a story like this.  Now they are just lazy stenographers for the regime.

        I like Derb and he’s been fighting the good fight for decades.But he also demonstrates the rot at the heart of tradcons.  The belief that if they are erudite enough the media will be persuaded.  Or at least acknowledge their intelligence.Theyre all trying to emulate Buckley. Or their impression of Buckley.  It seams they crave validation from the beautiful people.The reality is they’re never going to get it.  Best case is they’ll be ignored. More likely they’ll get mocked no matter what.Trump grasps that in a way the tradcons never will.  He talks past or through the media and beautiful people.  His outrageous buffoonery triggers the media into covering what he wants against their own inclinations.You’d think smart guys like Derb and other tradcons would get it through dispassionate analysis.  “I don’t like this tactic but it works”, but they just can’t get there.

            50% of the boomer brain isCaddyshack.You’d think they’d be funnier.In the media that parented our elders, the conservatives were partisans of “business” and “policy.” They represented and more importantlypresented asmanagement—a tested-in class of corporate nerd commissars, controlling you overemotional dummies via time card, dress code, and spreadsheet.Trump is their nemesis. He’s the vulgarest, lowest thing, an object of pure disgust: an owner, a boss.Trump is their goose-stealing Haitian.Commies and CEOs agree (as ever) and conservatives run behind them, little-dog-like (as ever).No amount of reality defeats an axiom. If conservatism is real (maybe it isn’t) then to its adherents, rank is axiomatic. The lowest HR blue-hair or Guardian columnist outranks Trump, whobarelyoutranks you. If the office ladies want Haitians, your objections are irrelevant. They’reugly.You’retalking about eating cats! I don’t know what the Haitians are doing, but I can see howyou peopleare. Etc.Or—1980 was a pretty good year, better than all the ones since. When grandpa gets confused and thinks we’re still in it, put your hand on his shoulder and hum that Kenny Loggins thing. It’s a brilliant song.

Huh. Something has worked? There’s somewhere that some tactic has resulted in Whitopia?
Do tell.

            This is interesting. I didn’t listen to the whole thing but his big mistake he says is not encouraging young men to get into politics the past 10 years he has been doing the YouTube.https://youtu.be/Iw3f8tesz-Q?si=IwRVoi4kPZsmvG9l

        I wish no-one harm. If, however, I were to find myself in a room with Alejandro Mayorkas and some large, heavy, sharp-cornered, throwable object, I don’t think I’d be able to restrain myself.i get this sentiment. But if all men are created equal and American are “a people” who have a special love of freedom. Then being brought into America and given a piece of paper that says you are an American is just a formality if you feel that special love.maybe these stories will get people to see multicultural is evil, but the principle is still the same and if what unites Americans is human nature than I don’t see a way to argue against this.this plus the belief in muh raysissm sinks any conservative argument against the extinction of whites in our former homelands.I talk to conservatives and they say once the blacks/yellows/browns are physically here, there is no moral way to remove them.i say, isn’t the survival of our people a justification of force?they say if force is used that people is not worthy of survival.its incredible. Conservatives really think a good lecture about being an American or an Irish or an English is enough, oh and kindness.

        To be fair to Trump, he’s never been all that great in debate.  He is far better when speaking off the cuff in front of his admiring fans.

        Four years ago Springfield’s population was 40,000. Today it’s nudging 60,000 — a fifty percent increase. Well-nigh all those 20,000 are from Haiti,
i can’t believe this. Must be an exaggeration . Is this true?

            If this is true, there is no conservative defense against welcoming the erasure of our people. Because there is no our people, it’s just people.the most you will hear is “I’m not racist but…” or “the numbers are too great and the time span too short, they need time to assimilate and learn our ways.”but why? Why not all at once? The conservative has no principled answer to this. I’ve heard them. They say a people, let’s say Springfields whites, are not worth saving if they use force to put out these purple people.even now they say this . I talk to them. There is no moral defense to muster will. Only a moral outrage against people like me who says force is the only way to stop our erasure.our people want to see their children swallowed up.

                I don’t get this defeatism.
We homeschooled. Once our kids grasped the number line (preschool) we added an orthogonal number line. While you can’t add apples and oranges, you can represent the sum. This segues easily into algebra, where x=apples and y=oranges. Vectors. Geometry and trigonometry. Imaginary numbers. Differential calc. It’s all the same damned thing. By the time they were 2nd or 3rd grade, my wife (also an engineer) decided she was outclassed, and switched to teaching science and chem and biology.
Do you really have so little to offer that you can’t do better than a friggin’ Haitian?

                        For all people here claim to treasure their progeny, it sure seems not a whole lot cared enough about them to keep them out of the schools. They were pretty bad in the ’80s. There’s no excuse for not knowing.

                My best friend inspired me a few years back by replying to the accusation, “You sound like a racist.” by saying, “Yes, I am. Why aren’t you?”I’ve used this dozens of times since and I’ve never had any reaction worse than the person walking away.Come to think of it, that’s the best possible reaction.And as lagniappe, they subsequently avoid me. This includes my next-door neighbor. I love to wave at and greet him as he studiously avoids acknowledging my existence.One day I almost literally ran into him in the grocery store – neither of us had seen the other.I greeted him effusively and stuck out my hand. He reflexively shook it.The look on his face will sustain me for quite a while.

                    I’ve been having an extended email discussion with this guy:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Pearcehe was the editor of this newspaper for the national front in England:https://archive.org/details/bulldog_ynf_03/page/n6/mode/1upHis story is fascinating . I’ve tried talking to patriotic alternatives guy (forget his name) about Pearce but he’s not as interested in him. Pearce was one of us. Back in the 70s but “converted” from being a muh raysiss by reading the great books. Who knows what the truth is. It must have been a time when the multiracial thing SEEMED to be a possibility because he was in prison twice for hate speechanywho now he’s a minor celebrity in the conservative novus ordo world.i pressed him on the definition of racism, the definition of neonazi, what it means to be an American/english/japanese and to his credit he answers my emails.but his answers are incoherent. If he wasn’t a public figure I would be doing this but part of his brand is being a convert from neonazi to anti racist conservative .he says England is no longer a white country and there is nothing moral to do about it. You must accept it. I asked if you replace the people is it still England. Then he tries to sell me his book about what it means to be English.and he writes something like this to me:we need to convince/convert these black Muslims into being English. That’s why I wrote the book. if you have a cultural, historic a d spiritual communion with englands past you are EnglishSo I ask if I had a cultural/spritiual/historic communion with Japan would I become Japanese.no, he says. If I moved to Japan, married a Japanese the. My children would feel the communion and be Japanesei says , then what’s the point of your book? And is encouraging migrants to breed with natives moral?then he got offended cause that’s what he did. He moved to America , married an American. “What, I shouldn’t have married my wife!?!?”it doesn’t take much to point out the woefully bad arguments these people have. I never got emotional but kept pressing. Take a look at the bulldog. Everything they were talking about in the seventies has come to pass. Except the ira thing. Now the migrant problem supersedes that.i wouldnt pick on Pearce if he didn’t make himself a public concert from neonaziism whatever that means (he can’t define it) and he wrote a horribly defamatory article for the national Catholic register about James fields and charlittesville to plug his anti racist book.maybe the Haitians will soon spiritually commune with American history and they will become little Sam Adams!

                        Was the name you forgot Mark Collett?Without looking into it further, IMO this other guy was either always a grifter or possibly got the offer he couldn’t refuse.I think the only way you really fall out of being a Based Red Pill once you get there is being given that offer, or possibly blackpilling over Whites being hopeless.Perhaps he came to the conclusion they weren’t worth saving or were too corrupt so he now (sincerely) thinks Nigerians and Hindus are the only way to pass the torch of “British civilizational excellence” or whatever.In almost any other case I’d just say they were never really Red Pilled to begin with, even if that comes dangerously close toNo True Scotsmanetc.

                            Yes collett. That’s the PA guy. I find Pearce fascinating because if you look at the bulldog in the late 70s they saw everything that is happening now. Ty e black gangs , the police arresting you for protesting, the housing costs for whites because of immigration, separating from the rest of the European market, repatriation of the migrantsall this is before the world now. I didn’t know there were people, like the young pearce and his father who saw all this back then , almost 50 years ago. And there was a fight. It got swallowed up.my guess is that he was a descent writer, and liked being a public man with his writing, and after two terms in prison FOR WRITING !!!! not as I originally thought for fighting or vandalism or harassment or anything like that, he just couldn’t keep it up and quit. In a way I don’t have a problem with that. But he wanted to keep a public life as a writer and intellectual. So he had to come up with a story to tell so he could be a public figure.he wrote that “I never said I was justly imprisoned “ well jeepers joe that’s a heck of a thing to leave out of the dozens of interviews you gave saying you were converted from being a sinner to being a good man. That’s a huge thing to leave out of your story. He implies that he was a bad man and thrown i in prison for being a bad man.so, he knew if he wanted to write and lecture abd not work at the Home Depot, he had to be “converted” and make public apologies and claim to be a former neo Nazi turned good conservatives. He did it. He created a whole new life . New family new adopted country, the us. And a career as a conservative novus ordo.. Well he has his plate of lentils now.

                            you got me thinking; I thinks it’s the former reason: he never was red pilled. Part of his story is his age. He was a 14 or 15 year old when he became politically active and his last prison sentence was when he was in his early or mid twenties.
what that may say is that it was all social. Or he simply was not mature enough to understand and just went along with a crowd and was swept up in the movement. Then the prison was too much

Have you seen Devon Stack’s streams? He’s said how it looks like almost everything the militia movements said has come about.

        If you are right, we are going to lose on the immigration thing, aren’t we? If Carl is the best out of your stack of books on immigration, we got nothin’.
FWIW, Denninger has a plausible plan that would not involve imputing characteristics not in evidence to “elites”, but rather make Dems to reveal themselves by forcing them to repeal popular legislation.
Yes, it involves getting “our” guy elected, but it couldn’t be a flim-flammer who on election night pivots away from acting on the promises that got him elected.

        I sometimes wonder if Derb’s longevity is due mostly to his (apparently) IDGAF attitude when it comes to podcasting monetization.
I respect the grift.  Including Zman (I’m a paid subscriber. Except when he took a dump on my employer for a couple months.  Trashing airlines is like shooting fish in a barrel.)
Maybe it’s the British accent.
Derb rocks.  I’d send him a bottle of Old Crow bourbon if I knew the address.

        Unlimited Third World immigration means genocide against Whites. There is simply no way to avoid it — the “best” outcome would be putting all Whites in camps and putting the Third World in their homes. They have to live somewhere.Given that each immigrant is a huge loss for the managerial elite, in terms of tax revenue going to support each immigrant (I think about $750,000 lifetime minimum) that is not available for other things: defense spending, green boondoggles that relatives of managers can grift off, other spending directed by managers, something is up.It costs money to fly them in from Haiti (around 40,000 or so), it costs even more money to support them (they won’t be creating wealth, just destroying it), and creates a fight with Whites who they plan to draft. The only thing I can think of is that the managerial elite has decided to eliminate White people entirely. That seems the plan.What are the people of Springfield going to do? They can’t move. Haitians are above the law, They can eat their pets, and their kids. Anything they have, the Haitians can and will take with the full backing of the law. This is being repeated everywhere: Aurora Colorado with Tren de Agua, Small towns across the nation. The scope and size of this plus the economy eliminates White flight.What remains is obvious to everyone but the elite. The elite are powerful but stupid. Look at Marvel. They have a $1.3 billion gross hit in Deadpool and Wolverine, and their follow up is quite literally a show inspired by, and aiming for “drag queen brunches to watch Wandavision.” Per the show-runner. [There is not going to be a sequel since it was an outside project Marvel head Feige tried to kill. It makes him look bad]. Marvel is following Star Wars into being solely for black lesbians.FYI there was an attempt to kill Trump again, this time with an AK-47. The FBI is not sending their very best.

        Oh, and obviously Daily Wire is pushing a point of view. 2000% sounds a whole lot bigger of an issue than 2000 illegals. (Nope, sorry, the politicians breaking the law to grant them Temporary Protected Status does not make them legal.)
Maybe the point would have gotten through to knuckleheads like Eric Adams had it been made clear that was equivalent to NYC having to make room for 4 million illegals instead of the 200,000 he says is breaking “his” city.

            My best guess is that the funders of the politicians and the Daily Wire *want* crushing immigration.  It makes them smile and feel hopeful about the future.  The politicians, like Eric Adams, are taking orders and their feelings about it don’t matter.
