        The sociologist Digby Baltzell once offered Grace Kelly as an example of white ethnic achievement.  R.S. McCain has offered that atThe Atlantic, ‘diversity’ has meant adding Megan McArdle to the line-up.  You see, she attended Penn and the University of Chicago rather than Harvard.Then you have Ta-Nehisi Coates, who’s a college dropout.  Nothing wrong with that, but it must occur to him sometime that his position there requires a dispensation from the usual hiring rules in effect.  I suspect some of what you read is an effort on his part to process that.Sorry to be repetitive on this point, but the man grew up in the Baltimore slums.  I was living in Baltimore at the time.  Not a pleasant place in many respects, even in the agreeable neighborhoods (though I remain fond of it).  The thing is, actually acknowledging what the problems are in Baltimore would fry TNC’s circuits (as it does Baltimore’s political class).  Some of this verbiage is just rationalization.One other point: BO really is not ‘their guy’.  BO’s connection to the black community is that he married into it.  What Gov. Blagojevic said (“I’m blacker than Obama”) remains ever true.  Eric Holder, a mulattish 2d generation American whose family is from Barbados, is certainly atypical within the black community as well (though he did grow up around American blacks, which BO did not).

            I’ve had the same thoughts about Coates maybe struggling to square observable reality with what he would like to believe. Maybe he is smart enough to know he is not the smartest guy in the room, but he really wants to believe he is the smartest guys in the room. I must admit that it is this puzzle that fascinates me. Nothing that he writes is all that interesting but his place at the Atlantic has a turtle on a fence post feel to it.
