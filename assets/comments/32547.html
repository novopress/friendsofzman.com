        Are the Army and Navy teams full of girls and trannies? Why not? I’ve been told girls can fight in combat, so I want to see a hundred pound girl named Kayden play offensive line against Shitavious- because that’s equity.

            The service academies relaxed admission standards for student athletes around 10-15 years ago to improve their teams.  Navy is playing guys named DaShaun, Daba and Rayuan.

                I attended the Academy forty years ago.  Even back then it was obvious the jocks, especially the swarthier ones, were let in on lower standards.  Same with the broads.
Has it gotten worse in the last fifteen years?  What hasn’t?

                    I should clarify that from everything we have seen the service academies have lowered standards across the board.  The standards for general cadets, midshipmen, etc. may not be any higher than they are for football and basketball players, they are much lower than they were 40 years ago.  The big shift at Navy happened when they hired a Samoan named Ken Niumatalolo as coach in 2008.  Army lost to them badly for a few years before they were able to catch up.

                It was still a great essay. Perhaps the Shitaviazation of college football will be next in a series on the subject.

            Many like to think of sports as the last bastion of meritocracy, but wokism is seeping into it’s pores nonetheless. Female reporters in the locker room, then female refs, kneeling about slavery, probably soon rainbow stickers on their helmets, armbands for trans kids, rainbow uniforms, pro-abortion bowl games. Is there a Pfizer®Bowl yet? Maybe no end to wokery’s infiltration?

                I would have no clue. I’ve not watched any sports in nearly a decade. But given how this crap is in everything else entertainment related, no doubt the spectacle you describe is typical today.

                There is a relatively new tradition of football teams wearing pink as a means of pledging fealty to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. I suppose it’s just a matter of team until the players are required to wear the sort of fake tah-tahs worn by Secretary Buttplug when he’s nursing his poor, godforsaken child.

                    Being in procession of  authentic tah-tahs, I hate the pink ribbon thing. I believe the Komen foundation was started by the usual suspects, meant to capitalize in every way possible the death of a sister.I’m also guessing that breast cancer mostly runs only certain ethnic groups, which is why all of female America is supposed to run get their tah-tahs Xrayed??? at 40 to screen for cancer. But it’s free! (kind of)No word on if the fake tah-tahs are supposed to get X-rayed regularly.

                    That came out when I was a young petty officer second class and naive as can be about that type. Why the hell does my supervisor come up behind me and want to rub my shoulders all the time?  No idea, he’s just weird that way.  A lot of it makes sense now, but I never thought about homosexuals ever back then.Later in life as a traditionalist Episcopal priest in a very liberal diocese I was a target for some of the extremely progressive older “straight “ clergy and gay activist laity.  One of the high ranking gays in the chancery once said to me accusingly “You’re actually gay behind that facade— you spent six years in the Navy and every body knows that’s the gayest branch of the military.”  I was stunned but I had the presence of mind to reply “Yeah, I was a sailor and you know what? I’m also a membri of the Santa Monica YMCA, for what that’s worth.”  I should have added “Bless you my son” but I’m pretty sure under my breath I used a good old Anglo-Saxon four letter word.Thanks for the Village People memory. “Another One Bites the Dust” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” are better songs.

        I could go on and on about the before times when bowl games did not have corporate sponsors and it was a fun water cooler chat about what team was ‘the best’. Those days are long gone. I think, and maybe I mentioned it before, the Republic reminds me of when you watch a hunting show on the outdoor channel when they shoot a big buck and the deer runs around/away. It’s dead, but the buck does not know this. It’s the Republic, running about although it’s dead.

        What drives me up the wall about football and sports, college or professional, are what those in my house call “The ‘We’ People”. You ask a friend how the game of their favorite team went over the weekend and they respond:“Yeah, we lost, we’re having a rough season; our new coach doesn’t know what he’s doing and our starter is out with an injury.”Wait a minute, who is ‘we’? Were you there, on the team, on the field? The team in question played in Colorado on Saturday, and I know for a fact you were sat on your couch in Michigan, drinking beer and eating a barrel of Cheez Ballz.Everyone knows a “We” person, where they speak about their sportsball team like they are an honorary member. This is really strange when they have no attachement to the team in any form. I have a “We” People friend that somehow is a die-hard fan of Chicago teams: the Bears, the Bulls, White Sox, and Blackhawks. He knows their entire history back-to-front, all the players, all the stats, wins, loses, follows every game, and whenever asked about a victory, defeat, or decision, answers “WE won”, “WE lost”, “WE drafted Jaquarius Shondel the 3rd in the second round”, so on, so forth. But he has ZERO attachement to the city of Chicago. Hehas lived in Michigan his entire life, his entire extended family has lived in Michigan for at least 4 generations. He has never lived in Chicago or Illinois, none of his relatives live there, he doesn’t have a girlfriend that lives or is from there, none of his relatives were nor are on any of the teams, he was never on any of the teams, and he doesn’t even gamble on the games. It is as if he spun a wheel at 10/12 years old, it landed on ‘Chicago’, and he has spent the ensuing 20+ years obsessively committing to that decision.I don’t know the root cause of “The ‘We’ People” but I guess that it is a lack of a culture, or community, or a desire to have comraderie, or join in shared experiences; or all of them at once, I suppose. It could be that, as our communities and cultures are fractured and diluted, drying up and blowing away, The We People latch onto whatever is left to feel, even if tangentially, part of something. And I have brought this up with my Chicago-crazed friend, with him agreeing that he needs to find something else more fulfilling in his life to spend his time on. But trying to get a lifetime We Person to delete their ESPN app is like prying a fifth of whisky from an alcoholic’s hands. I hope professional sports, and college sports as well, continues to lose relevance and cultural sway; drying up and blowing away. Then, finally, The We People and my friend can begin living their lives on their own, rather than vicariously through sportsballers.

            I think the “We People” phenomenon is down to TV. Before TV kids would support the local team. Now you have kids from New York being Miami fans, and vice versa, because they saw a game on TV as a kid and took a shine to them then.
If anything, spectator sport should be about local community.

            Forgot to mention, the “We People” friend obsessed with Chicago sports, is also a (somehow) even more fanatical University of Michigan football fan. No one in his family has ever attended a class there, never lived on that half of the state… no connection to it except he and the university are both in Michigan. He’s been one of my best friends for 25 years and I still do not understand this side to him.

                Grew up as a Chicago sports fan (long ago).  Given the content of all the pro (semi-pro in the case of White Sox) Chicago sports teams, why someone would actually want to be part of the ‘We’ crowd is difficult to understand.

            YES! Agree 100%. The synthetic, artificial “team” shit is pathetic. “We’re gonna make the playoffs! We’re goin’ ALL DA WAY, baby!”
Who the fuck is “we”? You’re an obese 300 lb 50-year old white slob sitting in front of a television wearing the jersey of some 22-year-old illiterate Negro sports mercenary making $20 million a year and you think you’re actually part of something other than a scam to lighten your wallet?

                    I used to watch sports 30 years ago, I don’t have any problem with it as harmless entertainment…but in my ‘burg the white retards are utterly OBSESSED with it as if it were the end-all and be-all of the fucking universe. And the politicians know it and can lead them down the garden path like the Pied Piper. Take your money and give it to Israel, enact gun control, raise taxes, enact ridiculous regulations and draconian laws, line their own pockets with corrupt scams and graft — the retards will happily go along with ALL of it so long as they get their sportsball.Yes, when a Negro catches a kickoff in his own end zone and goes juking down the field for a 100-yard touchdown return with two minutes left, it’s exciting. Clap, clap. Hoo-rah. Nice.But that’s it. It has no bearing on your life whatsoever. But these people act as if it’s the very meaning of their existence. I swear to God, they’d vote for Barabbas over Christ every single time if he was wearing a football jersey.Panem et fucking circenses…

        I see high school kids signing “letters of intent” every spring at the local high school to play college this or that and I’m pretty sure this year there was a sophomore who signed to play baseball with a state school 2.5 years down the line. These kids have their own profiles on multiple web sites, travel teams, go after school to “academies” run by former sportos who cracked the Cape Cod League once…it’s truly sad to see the priorities and know there’s nothing you can do to stop it. Once it’s in the parents — and it has been, since the 1990s — nothing gets rid of it except when the kid’s career flames out summer before sophomore year after a small injury sidelines them, and the 40,000 hours spent chasing a ball turn into nothing.

            American parents will invest tens of thousands a year in their mediocre kid’s sporting “career” (I’ve seen it repeatedly) rather than push for them to study for medical school or a physics scholarship.

                It’s an artificial community for parents to be sure their kids hang out with respectable kids while the parents build rapport and get to travel and party like they were younger. Kids can’t get in trouble with the school stoners if they are travelling every weekend.

                    Absolutely true. We spent thousands to keep our kids in swimming year-round, Kept them busy, disciplined physically and academically and around a “good group of kids.” Got them onto high school teams and even water polo.

                        Water sports are the best! And the physical specimens they become! Occasional ear infections but my hockey son did the occasional broken bones routine. Still, all told, both my lads went into the trades and are doing great, and once Hockey Son switched to surfing both to this day are huge into physical fitness even after their long work days. Cannot recommend swim, surfing and water polo enough for your kids or grandkids!

                    Truth. I encouraged my boys, and sacrificed much sleep and fuel to keep them participating in team sports. I give two shits about sportsball but approved of the challenge, physical fitness, and better class of friends H.S. sports provided. The friends they hung around with worth it alone (Hockey and Water Polo for the win; extremely lilly cadre so no gangster garbage friends!)
I don’t recall any partying like when I was young with the other parents.. too tired driving between long work shifts, assistant coaching… dear Lord we have three weeks of away games… etc.

                    This may be true but the academic side will probably suffer and the youngster will likely opt for some “cinch major” at the elite college. Probably better to do some decent STEM degree at a state university.

                    Our nephew is low thirties and successful. He was stud center lineman on Princeton’s football team. Bid and inducted Cannon-Dial-Elm eating club, the culmination of the top now.
He’s about to become father his first child with a beautiful, smart and jocular lady from Maine. They are fellow dissidents. They recently moved to a restored home in Maine. I bought them Japanese toilets/bidets for housewarming.
You have a point. Academics are from a practical viewpount devalued considerably. You need business acumen or something unique in order to get by as a young white male today.

                        Do the toilets have the mini-basin on top that allows one to rinse his hands using the water that’s filling the tank?  When I first went to Japan in 1995, I couldn’t believe that such a simple concept for water conservation hadn’t been adopted by the West.  And 30 years later it’s even more surprising that it still hasn’t caught on, even in other East Asian countries.

            My stepsons’ son, [my Wife’s grandson] is starting his junior year in high school.  He is an elite athlete, with all the investment you speak of from his father.  I am told colleges will start making him offers on September 1 this year.  He’s a JUNIOR for cristsake!  He has two more years of high school.  What are these vultures doing around this kid?If I was his dad, I would tell them “Piss-off, we’ll keep his options open until his senior year”.  But I guess this is how business is done nowadays.  It’s for the benefit of the college coaches, not the kids.

        In my hometown’s league, a collection of small po-dunk farming communities, you’re starting to see the same thing. Schools with graduating classes of 70 people or so are recruiting local talent and finding creative ways for them to go to their school. This has created powerful dynasties that win state championships time and time again, largely through the talent of people who don’t even have roots in the community.There’s more than greed going on, and a lot of obsession with being “the winner”, no matter how hollow that victory is. The stars of the team will pack up and leave town without a second thought the minute they get a better offer, but a least the school gets a trophy. Then everyone wonders why none of their kids want to settle back in town.

            One of the most egregious pro examples I have seen of late is Rea Madrid.  Their nickname is “Los Blancos” because of the white home uniform.  Watched a recent game of theirs and of 11 players on the field only three were White.  Should be called “Los Negros.”

            You nailed it. The twin corrosives of sports in AINO are rank greed and the win-at-all-cost mindset.

            “There’s more than greed going on, and a lot of obsession with being “the winner”, no matter how hollow that victory is. The stars of the team will pack up and leave town without a second thought the minute they get a better offer, but a least the school gets a trophy. Then everyone wonders why none of their kids want to settle back in town.”Worth repeating. Yes, greed is part of why the French soccer team is filled with French speaking Africans. The other part is want to “win” regardless of what that win means exactly. It’s the same reason 2nd rate athletics men compete in women’s sports. All the two men who won those women’s gold medal will care about is “having won”.

        The post about baseball was about the trivialization and socialization of technology. This one is about the transition of industrial capitalism to financialism.Technology was supposed to be about developing new materials to make light-weight super-strong cars and airplanes, for example. Instead, it is used for computer-based management of a baseball game. I was expecting an aircar and I got 140 character text instead.Likewise, free market capitalism was supposed to be about bringing new technologies, new products, and new services to the marketplace (automated kitchens, for example?). Instead, we got the leveraged buyout of the whole frigging economy by private equity fueled by preferential access to cheap money from the FED.I’m sick of this shit.

            Instead of getting useful technological developments by training actual scientists and engineers, this country decided to waste an incredible amount of human capital training financial engineers to degrade everything and enrich the parasitical overlords.

            “free market capitalism was supposed to be about bringing new technologies”Insofar as the “free market” exists at all, the only thing it will reliably produce is great wealth for whomever is best at manipulating markets and production. It’s a lot like evolution. It’s tautological. Survival of the fittest makes for more of those are, well, “fit”. What is fitness? It’s whatever survives at any given moment. People like to think that the free market is about this or that, but it’s only about what the market and government environment allow it to be about. A corrupt government and greed obsessed business elite produces just what you see in the US today. It doesn’t help that the US now a nation with little industry and few people who hope to become wealthy through invention or innovation. Most people today dream of making it big running some sort of scam or Ponzi scheme.

        If you need a good example of how college football was corrupted, take Alabama as an example. You can compare Bear Bryant with Nick Saban and clearly see the evolution from tribalism to financialization from the death of the former to the retirement of the latter.I’m sure there are other examples during this period. Not picking on Alabama.

                Apparently NIL was the bridge too far, even for Saban. Recruiting is now, or soon will be, just a green paper chase. Add into that the corrosive effect of gambling, which destroys everything it touches, and it becomes too much to manage for any old school coach. It’s moneyball all the way down.
I Am slightly interested to see how the 12 team playoff works, however.

                    Saban doesn’t like NIL because it removes almost all the advantages he had running a semi-pro team at Alabama while the NCAA looked the other way and imposed their rules on every other college team
Brcause of this, every record Saban, “achieved,” in his Alabama run should have an asterisk next to it, just like the records for obvious PED user Serena Williams.

They all eventually played in the nfl and some people recognize their names today when I tell the story.

                        I think even worse than NIL (to some extent you can hand that off to a collective) is the transfer portal. The top coaches spent years building a pipeline of elite talent and these days, that guy goes in with his scumbag dad and says if he doesn’t play day one he’s entering the portal. There are guys whose college career consisted of stops at 3 different schools, maybe even 4. I just don’t see how you can build a program like that.

A mid-major program trying to build that one special team to make a memorable run in the Big Dance gets players they developed pillaged right when they’re on the verge of stardom. There is no loyalty and gratitude whatsoever. Only selfishness and greed.

                Bags of money sold out from back doors of churches (Clemson) is a southern tradition. Saban was good, but not that good. Nobody has a run like he did without some outside help. See: Pete Carrol at USC. With all of that Southern California talent, they haven’t had the same kind of run since.
Fun fact: Pete Carroll, Saban and Bill Belichick are all part Croatian. Croatians like to genocide Serbs. Perhaps there also adept at cheating in football.

                        In fact, the founder of the Ustache, the Croatian Nazi paramilitary responsible for genociding Serbs, was a Catholic priest. (This is true, but it takes some effort to look it up.) I forgot the guy’s name.
Regardless of all that, it was just a joke, like people make jokes about Germans and they’re propensity to send people to the ovens.

            Alabama? No, the greatest example was Penn State and Jerry Sandusky. The man was literally raping children on campus, and the university, including the sainted Joe Paterno, tried to cover it up to protect the precious football program. When it finally broke, Normie, of course, cared more about the sportsball and Paterno’s reputation than anything else.

There is more to that story.
A local DA that was investigating Sandusky disappeared around 2005 or so.
They found his laptop in a local creek, sans hard drives.

            I sometimes look at estate sales online, and occasionally go to one.  Aside from ugly mahogany furniture and decorative junk, the most common spiritual symbol is the Bear Bryant memorabilia.  Sometimes Saban, but not often.  I often think that if our Alabama civilization, as exemplified in estate detritus, is studied by archeologists or space visitors of the future, they will definitely conclude that the Bear was our god.  These are Boomers, of course.  I don’t criticize – I’m a Boomer too, and was a childhood Bama fan.  I had a huge Johnny Musso poster on my bedroom wall.  I didn’t have a poster of Kenny Stabler, but he was definitely a hero.  Others, too.I haven’t watched an Alabama game in decades because it isn’t about any of that anymore.  Musso went to my brother’s high school.  We all went down to the “Redneck Riviera” a la Stabler for our vacations.The mania is still there, and people still watch the games, but I can feel it waning.  When all of us Boomer’s are gone, the shrines to the Bear will be gone as well.  Hopefully, the interest in the horrible TV games, as well, but my son-in-law still watches them, so who knows?  There’s no tradition I can see on the horizon that can unite us.

        You briefly touched on it here, but to me, the aspect of modern college football that made me tune out was dispelling the “student athlete” mythology. When you watch your favorite team or Alma-mater, those kids have an experience nothing like what you experienced. There’s no shared bond. Back when cnn occasionally did some investigative journalism, they had a great piece (you can still find it, circa 2014 I believe) on how dismal the reading comprehension was for the athletes of the large D1 basketball and football teams were. Close to 10% of the athletes were fully illiterate. An enormous amount were below 5th grade reading level. The amount that were actually at level, in elite institutions like UNC, was the vast minority, because demographics.When it was just legitimate students testing their skills against other schools, that was, and still would be really cool. What it is now is little more than the equivalent of minor league baseball and they throw on the logo of your school.

            Hey, Jimmy, nice to see ya’. (-;
It wasn’t so long ago that academic ineligibility was a specter that haunted college sports. Coaches, players and fans all dreaded grade reports because there was always a pretty good chance the hot-shot point guard or the lock-down cornerback flunked out and wouldn’t be able to play. Academic ineligibility is a thing of the past. Haven’t seen an instant of it in probably 20 years or more.

                Fake major fields are set up for them, too. The sad thing is, profs are allowing themselves to be suborned into this fraud. I guess an extra 20K per annum is an effective conscience blotter.

            I worked at a community college that actually recruited football players! I was shocked. The white quarterback, from out of state, was actually a decent student.The black athletes, however — both football and basketball — usually failed to show up for class, were unprepared and completely disengaged if they did, and failed most or all of their exams.  When the season ended they would simply vanish and and withdraw from the class, or quit college entirely.I think a fair number of them never expected or planned to get a degree, they were there to play ball for as long as they could, and nothing else.

                Back when I was a TA, one of my “students” was a certain KD, hot-shot freshman on the college basketball team. He started the semester okay, but pretty soon stopped attending altogether and his grades naturally suffered. Along about this time I started getting visits from Athletic Department “advisers” wondering what could be done to help get KD’s grades up. I told ’em he could start attending class, doing the work, and earning the grades. This seemed to leave them disgruntled. Anyway, I was slightly concerned pressure would be applied to me to artificially elevate his grade. I told the prof I was working for about this and said not to worry about it. If anything happened, he’d back me up. Dooling failed the class but had a fairly long and undoubtedly lucrative career in the NBA. And I wouldn’t be surpised if he’s living under an overpass in his native Ft. Lauderdale right now.

                    Looks like he was sentenced to prison in 2023 for fraudulent healthcare reimbursement schemes, so you’re not far off. Did not investigate much further beyond a single article but looks like that basketball program really made a difference in the life of another young scholar!

        I cannot hear of college football without thinking of photo ModernHeretic3000 posted of the LSU squad taking the field, a score of coal black faces, captioned “Diversity”.
I think the continued grip college football has on white men is even more offensive than that of rhe NFL.

        It’s a professional sport now insofar as top players are paid. The starting athletes have nothing in common with the actual students.I haven’t watched television for thirty years with exception of alma mater’s Wolverines, football, hockey and wrestling only. I had stopped watching but resumed last year because football was on a successful quest to win a national championship. I started on an intercollegiate team that was ranked #2 nationally and seldom had opportunity to attend the other sports back then, so I was making up for the past, I suppose.It’s such a time sink even when working through a game, and the nature of the athletes and games have changed, that I’m out for good now. Especially in view how much the experience has been politicized.

            I will still watch college football and hockey, but it is in the background while I do other things. There’s just too much nonsense woven into a football game now for me to see and watch it. Hockey is not too bad, but college football is a three hour commercial/sermon with some game play thrown in.

                It still boggles my mind how people can stand the commercials and constant interruptions, and don’t get me started on the commentary. There’s no reason a football game should last more than 2 and a quarter hours and zero reason for anyone to give a play-by-play of what you can see right in front of you.

                    I believe that is slowly killing the popularity of the game. But it takes a while, because allegiance to their team (moreso in some regions of the country than others) has a religious importance to the fans, so they endure the commercials and whatnot. However, it makes the game less attractive to new fans, who have many more other entertainment options now.

Like when the only ads you would see before a movie were for other movies?  Gambling was legalized in many states after 08, many states also moved into the illicit drug trade.  They’re desperate for money.  They refuse to allow deflation to happen because if would cause a revolution.  Even if you didn’t have a revolution due to deflation, those in charge would still lose power because they have the most to lose from it.

                    We don’t watch commercial TV any more, but on rare occasions we’ll turn it in.  This happened a few weeks ago with the Olympics.  My wife turned on NBC prime time coverage at 6pm local.  20 minutes into the broadcast we had seen THREE “human interest” stories and dozens of commercials…and absolutely zero sports.
She turned off the TV and we didn’t bother with the Olympics again.

                The top contending schools might play a total of 4-5 competitive games all season.  It’s rare that I even put a game on, but when I do, it’s background noise because it’ll probably be a 44-3 final score.I realized a few years back that I was mainly listening out of feelings of nostalgia.  College football sounds a certain way that my brain immediately associates with Fall and cooler weather.  I think for a lot of people, that is all it is: nostalgia.  They put on their hoodie and down a few beers and pretend they’re 22 and back in college for a few hours.I trace a lot of today’s cultural atomization to the 1990’s and the heroin shots injected into college football at the time. By the early 2000’s I had largely stopped watching and my friends no longer had parties centered on big games.

            “Especially in view how much the experience has been politicized.”
This has killed my desire to go to the movie theater.  It’s almost like hollywood decided to punish the populace after 2016 for voting for the wrong person.  But even the stuff that isn’t “political” is usually a rehash of something you’ve already seen 900 times.  Much cheaper to repackage the same stuff over and over then take a risk on something new.  Like i said yesterday about the zmans failing bank analogy, every year things get a wee bit worse.

                “It’s almost like hollywood decided to punish the populace after 2016 for voting for the wrong person.”You nailed it – that’s the truth right there. I’m in the biz; I hear the rants all the time. These people are unhinged. + the explosion of people with MBA’s in the business is what has caused – IMHO – the total &amp; complete degradation of the product into the repackaging/endless franchise/reboots. No one wants to take a risk &amp; filmmaking is inherently risky; there’s no “sure fire formula” to guarantee a hit so they try to repackage films &amp; market them to an already “built-in” audience. See all the Marvel franchises/reboots. They’re trying to wring the last drop out of the dishrag.What does an MBA from some Ivy League institution (that’s another problem) have to do with filmmaking? Does it teach/explain scriptwriting &amp; story lines? How to work with actors? No – it has nothing to do with any of it.And therein lies the problem.

                    And its not just Hollywood, its every industry.  That is why they all keep merging, the market can’t support even a few super large corporations, so one eats the other until only one remains.  Not like the government will ever enforce anti trust laws except asking for a cut by charging fines.  Deflation is the answer to all our problems.“Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people.”

                    Marvel isn’t coming back.
The Infinity Gauntletsaga is their most epic story arc. I knew that reading the comics as a little kid. They literally have nowhere left to go.
Bringing back RDJ is a mistake because it craps on the entire Iron Man arc. I’m also surprised he came back for Dr. Doom, a character that is always in a mask.
Also, no one cares about the Fantastic Four. Heck, no one cared about them in the 80s and the 90s because the world had already passed them by.

        The corruption of the various institutions of our society will allow for our rebirth. You can see it everywhere as institution after institution loses its moral authority. No one trusts the govt or the media. Now, the top educational institutions are losing their shine as people witness the insanity coming from “top” universities.College football is simply another institution losing its sway over people.The first step is people rejecting the authority of the institution. We’re in that process now. The next step is creating new institutions that match the values (and, likely, the demographics) of your people. That’s what will come next.

            Shine and sway losses are reflected in alienation of the older alumni, too. Read current alumni magazines and compare those to prior years. The Woke aspect is only one of the problems. The editors, or their puppet masters, go out of their way to tell older alumni to never donate again.Combine that with the depersonalization, idiotic league changes and rampant cheating for admission and grades on so-called university level coursework. There you have indicators of the decline of tertiary education. Smarter kids avoided the nonsense and debt to learn productive, portable skills rather than exiting with $250,000+ for a worthless degree in BS Studies.Room for creamreplaced the oldPaper or Plasticas the phrase to master post-matriculation.

                A lot I agree with there, Mr. F’d Up.  I throw my alumni magazine straight into the trash to avoid the degradation and degeneracy display in its pages.  The alumni associate is trying to get me to donate to the school to purchase some trinket for the campus.  No sale.  And apparently 43% of my class agree the place doesn’t deserve a penny from us, given how it has allowed gay marriages in the chapel, full bore diversity admissions, and a defacto anti-white male agenda.And, in appreciation for being a loyal alumnus, you get the honor of getting wanded after passing through a metal detector at the homecoming game.

                    I used to give a 50 bucks for some scholarship fund until the Uni I graduated from renamed my particular college because the guy it was named after – who donated the all land the uni is built on – owned some slaves back in the days it was legal. Now when they call I just say my college doesn’t exist anymore.

                    I had my undergrad and grad schools remove my name from alumni mailing lists.  Haven’t gotten anything from either in almost 25 years.  A letter from a classmate guilted me into sending a minimal donation in 2000, for the 20th reunion, but I haven’t been back to either  school and don’t plan on it in my lifetime.

        Academia is one of the primary sources of rot and decay in the US.  Supporting them in any way is supporting the enemy.  Some compromises have to be made if your kid wants to enter a profession requiring a degree, but supporting college sportsball is entirely unnecessary.80 years ago, college sports was far more about the athleticism of the students. Today, the teams are loaded up with dummies who are gifted useless degrees in order to have a winning team. Of course, they are all being paid, so it’s not really even amateur. It’s fake and gay like most other things in the empire.

            80 years ago, college sports was far more about the athleticism of the students.Way back in 1932 The Marx Brothers were making fun of the obsession over college football in their movieHorse Feathers:“The film revolves around college football and a game between the fictional Darwin and Huxley Colleges. Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, the new president of Huxley College, is convinced by his son Frank, a student at the school, to recruit professional football players to help Huxley’s losing football team. Baravelli is an “iceman”, who delivers ice and bootleg liquor from a local speakeasy. Pinky is also an “iceman” and a part-time dogcatcher. Through a series of misunderstandings, Baravelli and Pinky are accidentally recruited to play for Huxley instead of the actual professional players.”Professor Wagstaff: And I say to you gentlemen that this college is a failure. The trouble is we’re neglecting football for education.Professor Wagstaff: Tomorrow we start tearing down the college.Professor in Wagstaff’s Study, Professor in Wagstaff’s Study: But, Professor, where will the students sleep?Professor Wagstaff: Where they always sleep: in the classroom.And remember, the password is Swordfish.  😉

                    Mostly white gullibility for a clever enemy who is a gifted storyteller. This enemy reinterpretted the history of the whites to turn the white urges towards compassion and universalism against the whites themselves.
The end result is the media telling whites everday to hate themselves and everyone thinks this is normal.
A strain of the whites have always been utopian and they were happy to assist the enemy in subduing their own people.

                        Jeffrey:  Ostei likes to insist the western part of the state is still Texas.  Well, take away at least 50-75 miles along the border.  Take away El Paso, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, and all city environs.  Take away places like Celina and Princeton.  Texas is only Texas in people’s imagination, not reality.

                            DFW and El Paso are still Texas. Dallas is a shithole, but is still undeniably Texas, and Ft. Worth and EP are about as Texas as it gets. The presence of Messkins doesn’t undercut that. Like it or not, they’ve been a part of Texas as long as it’s existed. Real Texas exists. Your imaginary Texas never has.

                                Disagree.  DFW is NY and Chicago and California and China and Mumbai.  It is rare to meet anyone there who is Texas born and bred (and White).  We spent the past 29 years there.  Fort Worth is a bit more Texas, and also a lot more Mexican.  And like it or not, most Mexicans are NOT those with roots in Texas going back 100 years – they are almost all 1st and 2nd generation by birth, and still 100% Mexican by genetics and culture.   Husband grew up in El Paso when it was 70% White; it is now Juarez writ larger.

                                    I’ve lived in Texas 50 years and lived in Princeton, New Jersey two years. Although Texas has changed–and demographics are a major part of that–it still feels much more like the Texas I remember from 1974 than it does New Jersey. It’s all a matter of perspective. Just because something changes, doesn’t mean it has vanished. The Texas spirit is alive and fairly well. You just have to know where to look.

        It’s not just college football: look abroad and the same thing has happened with soccer. Money has absolutely ruined local (i.e. national) leagues. Don’t get me started… (OK, just a few points!)1) Star cult: super damaging to the game. Players like Ronaldo and Messi have been past their sell-by date for years but are still fielded because they draw in TV viewers, sell stadium tickets, sponsored sports gear. See Copa America final recently: when Messi came off through injury, Argentina improved drastically and went on to win. The Star Cult also means that big players get LeBron-type calls rather than being punished. Also cultivates this superstar mentality among kids rather than the unselfish teamwork needed to win consistently.2) Big money: huge amounts of cash are now concentrated in about 20 major European teams, the majority of them English and Spanish. This impoverishes other national leagues (e.g. Brazil, Netherlands, Belgium used to be strong when I was a kid, now they’re basically minor leagues feeding top players into England, Spain and top clubs from other leagues like Bayern Munich, PSG). Rich clubs also have massive squads, with many great players rarely seeing action: they’re paid way more somewhere like Chelsea, but they should be on the field entertaining fans somewhere else.3) Historic stadia demolished in favor of larger, soulless venues: Wembley, Highbury, White Hart Lane…Soccer is becoming NFL-ized and this leads to…4) Loss of atmosphere as most fans at games are tourists. Someone I know went to Real Madrid vs Dortmund in the 2024 European final in London: basically wouldn’t have known Madrid had won, fans trooped out silently, no singing, mostly rich Asian/Arab/North Americans. Now you see that at major clubs everywhere – which is why Messi fanboys from Qatar love the idea of an NFL-style European Super League. Why Saudi Arabia (guys with the biggest checkbook) are splashing out for their own Super League.Old-style community is still their lower down, but the major clubs and tournaments have been contaminated – and they all play the same dull style because the same players and coaches rotate among top clubs. It’s rare to see a homegrown hero like Steven Gerrard spend his career in one place.OK – rant over! Just making the point that it’s not just in America that financialization is ruining spectator sport.

            You’d think some kind of western financial collapse could cure a lot of what’s wrong with the (exceedingly boring) sport that’s called soccer. Since hypothetically the money would no longer be concentrated in the UK. It’s kind of baffling that it still is, frankly.

            It’s why a middling, throwback club like Millwall receives outsized attention.  There remains a residual amount of whites who still crave the tribalism.
If you want to be really depressed, go read the message boards on websites devoted to the major English clubs.  Thread after thread decrying this racist incident, that drunken punch up, or this “offensive” chant.  It was barely one generation ago that these clubs’ supporters were testosterone-filled men.  They’re all sissies now.

                Millwall used to be kind of a BNP redoubt in the midst of a sea of diversity (South London). Their fans have always had a tough reputation. I don’t know if that’s still the case, been many, many years since I was in that area.

                Every field has a version of this.There’s an old Aerosmith album that despite having no hits had an outsized influence on popular ’80s metal and the “grunge” that followed it. Music guys know the one. Recently I heard an academic musicological symposium about it, including two of the biggest names in our biz. The panel discussion was about how the lyrics are “gross” and how strange it is thattrans ally Kurt Cobain—it’s been decided that that’s the way history will remember him—was such a big fan, because Aerosmith is so “gross.”The questions from the audience were requests that the panelists repeat their condemnations of the album as sexist, low-class—and racist, because it put its white low-class sexism inblack forms, basically demonically possessing the blues.In real life Aerosmith were fans, promoters, and exponents of the “dirty blues,” old white guys’ favorite black genre, one of my specialties, lately being recast as “poetic” and “circumspect” (it wasn’t) compared to the RAPE CULTURE (it’s back!) of ’70s rock.Everything must be made fake and gay—and not merely homosexual, but the kind of gay that’sfor girls.

        Sorry to be a curmudgeon, but I’ve alwaysloathedcollege athletics simply because I can’t nod and wink along to someone lying to my face.  I’m sure it’s been the case since I’ve been old enough to watch it that colleges are recruiting half-wits to attend school that can barely write their own names and paying them under the table in violation of the rules.  Then they lie to our face about what they’re doing and pretend that everyone on the field is a “scholar” and they’re all “amateurs” playing for the love of the game.  The lying extends even further as they also lie about accounting for the programs and graduation rates and funding sources and everything else associated with the athletic department.  I’m fairly certain too that the colleges that field the most successful teams are those that are able to lie and cheat to a greater extent than any of the others – often with the co-operation of state and local governments – so I’ve never been the least bit interested in following any of them.  I even loathe myalma mater‘s program.  My most vivid memory of it is how one of the football team’s starting centers beat a man to death in a bar fight and walked away with nothing buy probation so he could play out the rest of the season.

                NFL Films were great, but nothing happens in football games.Televising that raw material was a primitive “reality TV”: self-scripting (almost), low-production-cost filler that’s visually boring enough to make the commercials seem thrilling in comparison.I haven’t seen a game this century, but the trend was toward making the parts between commercials too noisy and referential (to celebrity, politics, products, and other shows) to work as proper filler. If men are turning the Sunday show off, that’s why. It’snagging.In a similar irony to Foucault generating the rhetoric of “wokeness,” McLuhan et al.influencedmedia experts—who unsurprisingly end upworking in media—into making TV a continuous stream of homogenous propaganda, by convincingly positing that as its ideal state (full self-awareness). As predicted, it sucks.

            You might do alright with Georgia Tech and Florida State fans who have enough money to travel to Ireland.  The schools turn this into a big vacation package for fans and donors.  They spend a week hitting the usual tourist spots before the game.

                They will all be packed into Temple Bar Friday and Saturday. They hold one of these games every year in Dublin so it is well planned. It is a great time, even if you are not interested in the game.

No debt forgiveness, let it go back to bankruptcy. President potato head is the one who made it illegal to discharge student debt in the early 2000’s. Almost like they knew it was a problem even back then and didn’t want to stop the gravy train. Private lenders got out of the market in 08 and its been .gov financed ever since.

        The Globalist mindset abhors localism and particular places, which is reflected with the addition of Oregon, Washington, USC and UCLA joing the Midwest Big Ten, along with Eastern schools Rutgers, Maryland and Penn State.Last year I looked at the rosters of the football teams of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin just out of curiosity to see where the players are from.  Their players come from everywhere, such as Florida, New Jersey, California, etc.It used to be that those teams would consist of mostly in-state players, supplemented with many from neighboring states and a just a few from far away.While the fans have State Pride the players they cheer for, not so much.

                True.

                    The fake localism of sportsball has always turned me off.  There is not a single team in all of sportsball made up of only locals.  If “my town’s” team is made up of whoever they could buy from anywhere in the country (or the world in some cases) and is owned by someone not even from the area, it’s not my town’s local team.  It’s just a globohomo clownshow.
High school sportsball is far more authentic.  Even that is changing.

        Looking at history it seems that sporting spectacles of some kind are an integral part of civilization; it’s just a question of which sport is popular at which time and place. When college football is no longer the circus, something else will be. From an evolutional perspective, what I find more disturbing is the negrofication of it, and how that has infected the white fans. Especially the younger more impressionable ones.

        American football is catching on here in Germany in a big way. Fun fact, no German team is allowed to have more than two American players. Evidently Germany still has a long way to go to play up to US standards. I think partly because sports is not part of school here, it’s always an after school thing with mostly private clubs. No such thing as school or university rivalry or the level of competitiveness your kids have growing up.

                Germany and Japan are satrapies of the GAE, so they need to be enculturated with the imperial ethos, at least until the Morgenthau’ing is complete.

        Doing a check of ticket prices for some top 25 teams shows you can get ones to games against cream puff opponents Labor Day weekend for dirt cheap, but the Clemson-Georgia game in Atlanta is still over $100 for the worst seats.  Colleges have still managed to have some success pulling people in for the environment around the game.  Tailgating is still a big deal and like the NFL they have had success getting businesses to buy tickets. Going to a game is usually a fun time, especially if the weather is nice, but hardcore fandom seems to be dropping off like it has for the NFL.  A lot of the interest is gambling based now, I think eventually the model has to collapse.

            I wonder how long gambling props up sports. In the days when Jimmy “The Knife” was setting odds and you could find an edge by studying the sports pages, gambling made some sense. Now it is robots setting the lines to maximize the take. Even if you use your own robots, the opportunities are increasingly small.

                There have been some recent articles about what a problem online sports betting has become already.  College football fans have always been dumber than most about how they bet. Brain dead allegiance to the alma mater without any thought as to how likely they are to cover the spread.  I saw a post this week that said one of the books reported taking a $10k bet on Colorado to win the Big XII, they will be lucky to finish in the top half of the league and have no chance of winning it.  There is zero political will to even restrict sports betting, the impact on people will have to get to the point it can’t be ignored before the pendulum starts to swing back.

                    I am of two minds on the sports betting issue. Making it easy for people to place bets from their mobile device is going to create more social pathology and inevitably result in the rigging of games. This is a huge problem with European soccer. On the other hand, the proliferation of casinos has been bad for casinos. Once the novelty wears off, they were left with the degenerates who would find a way to piss away their money on something.Sports betting has another issue and that is technology. My guess is the old fashioned schemes like point spreads and parlays give way to weird prop bets tied to fantasy leagues. Those are hard to rig with robots.

                        So there’s a new market for convoluted financial instruments, the product is morally injurious, every transaction is integrally rigged against the customer, and “demand” has been generated by successful lobbying for changes in the law, not by traditional economic means.
Sounds likeexactlythe kind of thing that just happens and nobody did it.

        Something else I dislike is the renaming of sports facilities from their traditional names to those of corporate sponsors. I first noticed this driving up the 101 from SFO into the city when I saw that Candlestick Park had been renamed 3Com Stadium about 20 years ago.
In my area, the Rose Quarter has been renamed ModaCenter. I despise this trend.

        I used to be a huge college football fan. In the Southeast, you watch SEC football on Saturday and go to church on Sunday.But now, I just don’t give a damn. In the past decade, the someone logical regional conferences have been replaced by gerrymandered hoovering machines designed to maximize TV money. Players are now paid in shady deals by boosters that are now LEGAL and the playoffs have expanded to 12 teams like the NFL. Cripes, they’re even going to have a two-minute warning like the NFL.When the U.S. Supreme Court decided that 1982 case against the NCAA and allowed conferences to independently sell their TV rights, that was the end of the sport many of us loved.As for Flaw-duh State and Jawja Tech playing a football game in Ireland, read how the staffs of these programs are having to pack for the useless trip. Why play in Eire? What is the point of this, other than the novelty?https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/40943664/florida-state-georgia-tech-week-0-ireland-logisticsIt’s just all insanity. It’s like the supposed sequel to Spaceballs because it’s always the search for more money.The people writing the big checks don’t give a damn about the fans and their wants. Ancient rivalries that brought people joy have been kicked to the curb. One reason for lower attendance is the clarity of modern flat screen TVs, along with exorbitant ticket prices.One of the nation’s oldest conferences was shivved and killed by their friends in the Big Ten. No more Rose Bowl.The non-revenue sports are screwed because it’s one thing for the multi-million dollar football team to fly across the entirety of the country for a game against Rutgers, but what about the women’s basketball and softball teams? So much for “academics.”It’s out of control and something should’ve been done years before to put a stop to it.

        While it’s true that people hold onto traditions I think that really only applies if they both grew up with it &amp; had a positive experience. If you grow up &amp; all you’ve seen is people clinging to a husk you’re probably not going to cling to it.I’m reminded of a fishing spot that my family had gone to generations, when it was my time it was already in the beginning stages of diversity decay. Every year I went it was worse off &amp; eventually I stopped going. Admittedly I have a very low tolerance for diversity &amp; especially seeing nature being destroyed by littering.When I see professional sports that’s all I can think of, I see spoiled termites who despise my race playing a game, I can’t not see that. The dissonance of seeing these people destroy our neighborhoods &amp; turn pristine nature into a landfill &amp; hating them for it but then turning around &amp; cheering them on in sports is completely foreign to me. It gets even more ridiculous when those same people complain about the state building new stadiums when the old ones are still perfectly functional, funded with our tax dollars no less.Years ago I thought for sure the kneeling negro phenomenon would’ve put a massive dent in the people who support this stuff. I was completely wrong, they just bitched about it while continuing to tune in every Sunday &amp; buy season tickets.I do wonder if younger people are dropping off though. All the people I just described have the excuse that football wasn’t a completely anti White negro fest during their youth whereas that’s all it ever was for young people growing up today.I keep seeing articles about how the American dream for people coming up now is now to leave the country, would seem to suggest they have no attachment to anything here. I can’t blame them, unlike me they don’t have any memory of America that wasn’t completely destroyed. It’s no wonder people are increasingly moving to Mexico &amp; South America. Now Russia has opened their door for people who are fleeing the West, I expect that sort of thing to become more widespread as we continue to spiral the drain. And why not? The White man is the West’s greatest resource, any country that’s not run by utter morons will naturally want to poach our White population for themselves.

        America is home to hundreds of millions of personally-owned firearms and a gazillion rounds of ammunition. Most of this sits in dusky vaults and is rarely used except for a few token trips to the shooting range or the annual hunting week in the woods. During the Olympics, a middle-aged white guy from Turkey took the silver in pistol shooting and become an international sensation. Since financialization has destroyed sports, why can’t the reverse also be true?

        I have not watched any sports in nearly a decade. The last time I watched football was the year Seattle won the Superbowl (I think it was ’14). College ball is no longer what it was because the players will now actually get paid starting, I think, next year.You are correct that the Pac12 no longer exists. Most of the schools that were in it are now a part of the Big12, which is now probably the big24 or something like that. The transition of college ball actually started 25 years ago when they went to a true play-off system.I think the last time NFL had any commonality with the general public was the 1970’s. Its all been moneyball ever since.

        “For most families, primary school is a function of where they live. Your kids go to the local public schools whether you like it or not. It is why in the current age it has become common to ask the realtor showing you houses about the local basketball team. Parents understand that they are not just buying a house, but they are committing their children to the schools that come with the community in which the house is located.”Questions about the quality of the school district are really questions about the extent of “diversity”, which is itself an euphemism for the percentage of noggers.

                Go to Schooldigger.  Grades only tell you how many Asians have moved in, or subcons who check the “white” box on the census records.  Check local elementary school racial demographics over the past decade.  Compare to high school racial demographics.  Then you know who has moved in and who is having kids, and you delete those places from where you are looking.  It’s quite simple; don’t know why people make it so complicated or ask the realtor.

        I am finally making some headway with “normies” on how they’ve been systematically robbed.I show them a quarter from 1963 which was 90% silver and has a value of $5 based on its silver content. Versus its $0.25 face value. The difference is 20 to 1 (as an aside, I believe the latest ratio in fractional banking was a bank could loan out 20 times the actual holdings in its vault).So I say that difference of $4.75 is what the government has essentially stolen from you. And why the price of eggs should really be about $0.20 if that quarter was still 90% silver.Even my mom, God bless her, I could see the wheels turning in her head.Moral of the story: people are starting to get it and using a silver quarter to make a point is effective.

        Went to grad school at USC. It was fun to watch tne big time football program.  Now that it’s pro football with free agents and all, and the Pac-10 is dead – I’ve lost all interest.

        its kinda cool here today. Feels like fall, but I know I’ll get tricked with another 90+ humid day between now and real fall.i think the collapse of everything I remember and love from growing up in the 80s had increased what would also be a nostalgic age anyway, but I have been  especially nostalgic in the last few years.college football was a big part of fall. But it was going to the games in middle school and high school that was so fun. not the games. Sometimes. My family would watch a game on tv.  It was Tailgating, sitting in the lawn not the bleachers, sneaking a beer.my best friends father was the president of the university so we had all this great food and the presidents box. Haha! Jesse Jackson’s son played for the team and one game, Jackson was in the boothwith us. My friend dared me to go say something to him. I was probably 13 or 14 and stupid . Jackson was with his body guard who was massive. I remember Jackson being pretty big too, but maybe it’s just a trick of the mind. I  walked up behind Jackson, clapped him on the back, Hey, Mr Jackson!he whipped around! And I just walked away with a preppy smirk on my face! Oh  golly those were greatI could care less about college fiotbll now. It could disappear and I wouldn’t notice./

        Chatting with an old gentleman at the Heysham station in the UK, he asked me who my team was.  He seemed fairly amazed and dismayed when I told him I didn’t have one, that we just had college teams that I didn’t follow.

        College football in the South has always been an important social get together, often with major players taking part in a generally friendly rivalry..i.e. the Texas-Arkansas game attracting a lot of oil and gas executives…I know of at least one major contract (in 8 figures) being signed by friendly rivals…Texas won that game, but Arkansas got the better of the oil and gas deal….

        Many years ago, when Moon Man was a threat so great to the power and rent-seeking opportunities enjoyed by The Jew Thing that they proscribed the entire genre, a bright young thoughtcriminal channelled his college experience into something called  “Chimps in Suits” which speaks directly to the darker side of all this.  It can still be found, if one knows where to look.

        The mega conferences, the transfer portal, and NIL are going to ruin college football. Schools like USC and UCLA have no business being in the Big 10, and give it a year or two and they’re going to figure out it’s a poor fit for them. I don’t know how long the contract lasts, but there’s some kind of term, and probably a penalty for dropping out early. I think there will be an effort to put back together some kind of Pacific coast conference. It never made sense to me that Utah and Colorado were Pac 12 members, so maybe a resurrected Pacific conference could include the original Pac 8 schools, plus maybe San Diego State and Fresno State.

        College football was the only sport I actively followed. It has been ruined and is now NFL Lite. It will continue to be successful in the short run due loyalty of old fans, curiosity seekers and NFL fans looking to watch something on Saturday afternoons attracted to it becoming more like the NFL.

        I watched a video the other day about a new NFL player refusing to sign up with the PA for licensing rights, and it goes back to what happened to him in college. Basically, after the whole NIL stuff came out, Fanatics.com, a giant sports merchandise company that is run by Michael Rubin, started going to college athletes and offering them a bit of upfront money in exchange for restrictive and burdensome deals that are now limiting the top guys’ ability to maximize revenue now that they made it to the pros. If that reminds you of the deals that record companies used to, quite frankly, steal from the artists they signed, it should because it’s exactly the same thing. Surprise surprise, they blew up the entire college sports operation with this NIL thing, talking in some high-minded way about how people can now earn money in college playing sports, but it turned out to be yet another grift for the moneychangers.

        I’ve mostly lost interest in pro and college football. I still follow the local high school teams (I still live in the district I and my children attended) The boys play for fun and they are mostly local (although charter and religious schools have become prominent). There are still local rivalries that are actually local (not Oregon and Rutgers). It is what sports should be but no longer is above the high school level.

        I enjoyed your article and agree, generally with the premise.
However, you would agree that the group of schools in the south eastern part of the United States have been more successful in  maintaining the traditions you spoke of rather than being a façade. And to my relief, it doesn’t appear like they’re going to be changing in the near future.

        This article needs a little more development on a few points.1. First of all, universities are not necessarily running big time sports and entertainment by choice. They do it because it is one of the best ways to promote your school. College administrators also say that a successful football program is the number one driver of enrollment and can lift a school’s academic profile. One example is the University of Southern California, which used football to raise its academic profile. (They were a bit of a backwater school back in the old days.) In fact, the blue bloods of the PCC like Stanford resented them back in the old days for this.2. The PAC schools simply couldn’t make the kind of money staying in their conference that they could make in the Big 10. They just don’t have a critical mass of schools with the kind of fan engagement you find in the Big Ten and the SEC. That means they can’t make $90 million dollars a year like they’re going to be making in the Big Ten.3. There’s also the issue of exposure. Being buried in the Pacific time zone means that nobody sees your games and the rest of the country.4. Football does indeed drive enrollment and name recognition. I know my own nephew when he was touring universities actually went to see Rutgers. He never would have done that if they weren’t a member of the Big Ten. I was talking to a guy who went to Alabama. He said about 70% of the people he interacted in college with came from the Northeast.5. I look at football as not much different than performance arts taught at the university level. At the end of the day, it’s not really that much different than theater or music. You practice to learn your craft and you perform in front of an audience.6. If you doubt any of the above, read this excellent article and you begin to understand the ancillary benefits that come from running a successful sports program.“How Big Ten changed Rutgers beyond athletics”https://www.nj.com/rutgers/2022/11/how-big-ten-changed-rutgers-beyond-athletics.html7. Ohio State has gone from being a football drinking school back in my day to a school that is a top 20 public institution and maybe just a step behind the likes of Michigan. It is one of the top 10 research institutions in this country. Of course, they had to have a commitment to academics, but successful college football was also a piece of the puzzle.Ohio State was always good on the research and academic side, but not very selective when it came to their student body. Now they’ve up their game from good to maybe a step behind great. They rode the coattails of a successful sports program to get to this point.8.https://youtu.be/p060LdJodXQ?feature=shared9. I’m not a big sports guy myself, but I do understand the bigger picture and why this is all important. Now let’s see how many downvotes I can get from you all.

                I got the point of the article, but it’s popular to bash college athletics when people don’t understand the bigger picture. Without athletics, a university campus is just a glorified office park. Athletics also keeps alums, some of whom are incredibly wealthy, connected to their school. When was the last time you cared about your high school and how it does in sports competition? Awareness of your university is a lifelong endeavor for many people.

                                    And my point is that for people to love something, it doesn’t have to have money attached to it. I think what zman was saying is things start out just because people like it, then parasites realize you can make money from it, then the industry matures and becomes corrupt. The cycle starts again. What did you think he said?
(Also correct me if i’m putting words into your mouth zman)

And this fits into what myself and Mr. Tarkas are discussing below.  In a debt based system the debt must always grow (the spice must always flow!)  So must continue to monitizie things to continue to grow the economy and create “jobs”.

                    We have far too many kids in colleges.  The kids who don’t belong in college the most (on average, I know there are exceptions) are the “student athletes,” especially football.
These programs likely attract generic students.  Someone thinking about being a geologist is going to pick the school with the best geology program.  “I was going to pick school X, which has a great Y dept, but I chose Z school because it had a better team” said virtually nobody ever.

                        Again, DEFLATION is the answer.  When you get to the root of deflation its rather frightening and you understand why they fear it so much.  If the Economy was an Eco System (good way to think of it) Deflation is the environment telling you that you’re above carrying capacity.

                            But the root cause of deflation being such a problem is the way our economies are structured.  It’s a self-caused problem.  It has bee set up in such a way that it needs perpetual growth, even if the growth is just nominal.  We very likely have not had real growth in decades.

                                Exactly, it(deflation: the bad form, good deflation does exist also but that isn’t relevant to our conversation) shows that they’re incompetent and structural changes need to happen. If you’re running the show, do you want to relinquish power? Is it any wonder they have everyone fighting about genders and nonsense?  Or trying to start wars overseas?

                                    What deflation is good in our economic system?  Keep in mind that I am using the term deflation to mean the contraction of the supply of money and credit.   But I really know very little about the subject, so there be deflation I am unaware of.If you mean falling prices, usually prices fall for different reasons and really don’t have much deflationary force.Like if something used to be made really well, but now is plastic junk, it likely has a lower price, but is not deflationary.  Or if some new process makes an improvement and lowers price, this would be in the same category as above.  Or if a fad falls out of favor, this could lead to lower prices.

                                        Good deflation would be when you become efficient at making a product and can then sell it for a lower price. People generally use the computer industry as an example. The cost was very high when the industry started but was lowered over time due to becoming more efficient in production. Then again that deflation could also because we shipped our manufacturing industry to SE asia.“Like if something used to be made really well, but now is plastic junk, it likely has a lower price, but is not deflationary.”I wouldn’t call that deflation. If something costs me 100 but last a life time and something else costs me 10 but has to be replaced every year, over time its going to cost you more. You see another example where deflation would be useful in the software industry or tech in general. I think the heads of those industries understand this and that is why they are trying to force everyone into a subscription model.We would view something that becomes automated and creates products at a cheaper price as “good deflation”. Have you ever heard about the luddites or what was refered to as cottage industries in england? They view the loss of their jobs to automation as bad, but the products were made much cheaper and the consumer didn’t see it that way.  We had “good deflation” when our overlords crushed manufacturing in our country and moved it all to asia.  Slave labor is cheap eh?

                                            From my understanding, deflation is damaging not because the general price levels fall, but because debt is destroyed.  One man’s debt is another man’s asset.  You default on your debt, the person holding that debt has to write off that asset.  He’s now broke and so his debtors have to write off his debt and so on.  They call this a “deflationary spiral”  Lots of layoffs and business failures reduce demand even further and may lead to additional business failures, layoffs and closures.But if prices are falling because of increased productivity, poorer build quality or a fad going out of style or something, this can lead to higher profits and a growing economy.  Though I do take your point about lower quality leading to more frequent purchases to replace the item 8 times in the time the original would have lasted.This is why I separate the contraction of the supply of money and credit into deflation and why I don’t necessarily see falling prices as deflation.  The only way I would see falling prices as deflation is if prices were falling due to low consumer demand due to an actual “deflationary spiral,” which is possible in my understanding.

That only happens when your currancy is debt and debt is your currancy.  The gold standard existed for a reason.  You can only inflate so much if you have a hard anchor (and honest people who enforce the rules fairly).

                                    AFAIK, we have never been on a “real” gold standard and there have been deflationary recessions in the 19th century.
At some point in the 1880s or 1890s there was a major boom bust cycle ending in a huge deflation.
From what I know, the Dollar was backed by both “commercial paper” and gold.  Presumably this “commercial paper” was what fueled the boom.

                                        Yes you still had deflationary depressions, but they generally didn’t last as long. They also let the deflation happen back then. Everything we’ve done since 08 and even 01 was to prevent deflation. Its why they drop rates to 1% (2001) and then in 08 to 0% plus QE. QE is just buying bad debts and putting them on the feds balance sheet and giving the holder of the debt cash. And a lot of what they’ve been buying have been treasuries, so what does that say about treasuries. Capitalism needs to destroy itself from time to time, if you don’t let the bad debt clear it becomes cancer, which is where we are now.  You should google john exters pyramid of wealth.  They may have used commercial paper along with gold, but silver was also money until the 1960’s i believe.?fit=940%2C627

                                            Warren Buffett recently increased his holdings of US treasuries to about $200 billion worth. So that’s one person, who ought to know, who still has some faith (in treasuries). But not in stocks, to which his exposure is correspondingly reduced.

                                                JefferyDo you think the stock market going from slightly above 20kish in 2019 to above 40k in 2024 is due to economic progress, or because we printed more money in 2020 then we created from the founding of our country? Perhaps Warren knows is a huge bubble and is getting nervous. If the economy is truly growing, the price of oil would be much higher. Though i think we’re (the US) attempting to keep the price low because its better for our economy and it punishes russia. The price crashed from around 100$ a barrel in 2014 and has hovered in that area until present day. What happened in 2014? Did we get super efficient cars? No? Russia took Crimea perhaps? In an economy that relies on oil, you can think of oil as natures interest rates. (and you can’t print oil as far as i know, fracking might be the nearest equivalent to it) The only way to put off nature for a brief period is living in fantasy land aka expanding credit and using it to force prices where you want them, either buy providing alot of credit to certain industries to cause prices to go up or denying credit to certain industries and prices go down. I think our overlords realize we are going to lose control of the oil markets in the near future and that is why they’re going on and on about switching everything to electric and “green”. Credit to the economy is like a drug or booze, its why they used to say the fed was taking the punchbowl away from the party when they raised rates.Also without the bailouts in 08 uncle warren would’ve went bust.
