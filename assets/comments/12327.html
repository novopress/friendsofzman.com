        Very, very interesting. The levels of nepotism and logrolling hidden below the surface gloss of normie media must be staggering. Recall the occasional stories about how so many media personalities re married to or related to apparatchiks in government. Also, this recalls other hidden aspects of favoritism that would otherwise demolish certain political pieties, such as “immigrants are better entrepreneurs than natives.”  There’s some kind of special bonuses for non-whites and non-males bakes in there. Tax deferrals or incentives from Uncle Sugar for SBA loans if you can show your business is minority. One scam is since the tax break lasts for only so many years, and when the break runs out you sell the business to your non-white relative and he sells his to you. Then the tax deal renews all over again.

        I would imagine as a denizen of Baltimore you’ve seen The Wire.  Detective Freaman’s observation is a pro po, “You follow drugs, you get drug addicts and drug dealers. But you start to follow the money, and you don’t know where the fuck it’s gonna take you.”

        I’d argue immigration DID cost the GOP the 2016 election. It’s why we elected Trump, who has been at war with and stymied by the GOP ever since.

            Trump may be a Black Swan. His impact is that of pulling the curtain back on the wizard. What is seen cannot be unseen.

        I feel like I have been thrown in the wayback machine. I subscribed to the American Spectator and National Review in the 80s. Emmett Tyrell’s pathetic Buckley imitation with his five dollar words. It was fun for a while though, Tom Bethell, Ben Stein were good reads.
It is really hard to fathom doing that again, either I have changed or they have. Look at all the positive changes brought by these conservatives, heartening isn’t it?

            That is a really good point. The GOP/Conservative Inc. keeps acting as if all they have to do is scrape off the populists, immigration patriots and social conservatives and they can go back to way it as in the 90’s. Maybe they are right, but I don’t think so. I’m not going back.

            I was about to say the same thing. Tyrell is a cuckservative without the Buckley flair. I got bored and stopped buying the rag. What did American Spectator ever conserve?

        I notice that a lot of people that post make what I consider a mistake in their worldview. It is the concept of “rich people”. Since most of us are not “rich people”, we don’t see ourselves as one, but someone else might. I never considered myself rich, not being a millionaire, but I live in a “gated community”. It is a neighborhood that has gates on all the entrances and has a homeowner’s association. Would Trayvon Martin consider me rich if he were not taking a dirt nap? Maybe. Someone made an issue out of a rich person spending less for their Guatemalan maid so naturally they are for “open borders”. But, the truly rich don’t have Guatemalan maids and could care less if they saved $2000 a year. Zman made a comment about how for “rich people” universalism and altruism have become a civic religion and that “these people literally get weepy when they see non-whites behaving like whites. It is a source of validation they get nowhere else. They truly believe they are making the world a better place with open borders.” The truly rich, those that buy and sell countries and make the decisions about flooding White countries with the dregs of the 3rd world, are too narcissistic and selfish to get weepy about anything concerning anyone besides themselves. They don’t care about making the world a better place and they don’t need validation for their desires. They have decided that there will always be people of a certain level of intelligence available to maintain their compound and provide food and energy for their homes and vehicles. It doesn’t matter to them if the majority of the population is low IQ and lazy. Everyone has a low IQ and is lazy in comparison to them. If 90% of humanity deserve to be killed, there will always be the “talented tenth” to provide the engineering, technical expertise, maintenance for their possessions, and the ability to kill the other 90% if they get out of control.With the pernicious poison of debt, what used to be rich is no longer rich. It is upper middle class. Being a millionaire is barely enough to retire on, especially if you live too long. With cars you would actually consider owning approaching and exceeding $50,000 (I am actually old enough to remember when a $50,000 house was posh) and homes in neighborhoods you would live in more than half a mill (even much more in California or other blue States), with food and hardware costs increasing daily, so called “rich people” are spending the majority of their income just treading water. Maybe they get a fancy vacation with their family every year, but then they spend a few months paying for it. No, the real rich you have never met. They don’t even consider Bill Gates rich because he pays taxes on his income. The real rich have power. They don’t necessarily “own” things. They control them. They are descendents of families that have always acted behind the scenes. They don’t care if the policies they promote make life better for the little man or if they exterminate him. They are neither liberal nor conservative. They are pragmatic materialists. They just learned a long time ago that it is better to be unknown than known by the masses. If you are known, you can have a target attached to your back. They hire the people you think are the decision makers. They seek out slightly above average intelligences for these positions but they are also chosen because they are corrupted and will do what they are told.The mistake that most of us make is to believe these people are well meaning and just confused about certain things. They are not. They have a view of things that would be chilling to you. They can make the decision to exterminate millions of individuals with no more concern than you would have if you crushed a flea. What do you call people like this? Well, ruthless for one thing. Sociopathic is a good one. Cruel. Inhuman. But, I think the best word for their ilk is evil.

            Very true. They tend to treat life as a series of transactions, as that is how their part of the world is defined.  Everything is transactional, and the 99% have no basis for transacting with them, other than as their servants to meet their needs, wants, and preferences.  So the 99% don’t really exist, in their world.You can see it, in action, in some of the ways that Donald Trump relates to the people in his immediate orbit.  Some can’t handle the transactional elements of the relationship, and others are OK with it.  Here’s the big question: Is Trump’s relationship with the rest of us, MAGA and all that, strictly transactional?  Is the reaching out and trying to connect with the rest of us strictly the means to an end (our political support) and an act he puts on to transact with us?  Or is there more to it than that?

            The maids were an example to illustrate a basic, generalized worldview common amongst a certain type of people that are often referred to as “rich people.” Scott Locklin (correctly) refers to this group as “upper middle class”, even should they become substantially wealthy as Gates and Bezos have done. They are representative of a striving aspirational group as opposed to old money families like you’re describing. I’m quite familiar with how these people think because I grew up among them.I assume the readers of this site can draw the distinction between a Louis-Dreyfus or Rothschild and an orthodontist bringing in $300k/year. But most people can’t. That’s why Bernie Sanders’ supporters wanted to raise taxes on “the rich”, with the top bracket starting at around $200k iirc. They don’t understand that the true rich don’t have an earned income to tax.Wherever you decide to draw your personal distinction of what you consider “rich”, the point remains that these people share a willingness to throw entire countries to the wolves for their personal gain.If you thought the point was an attack on people that make six figures and live in gated communities, then you missed the point entirely.

        Is there any conservative news site that is self supported, that is, true to its readers? Your post this morning is more in the form of investagative journalism than your typical work, and it would be nice to see the whole Conservative Inc get a financial look-see. The Federalist is one such site I’ve always been suspicious of, I think with reason. Thanks for the work that went into this post. Tim

            The problem is that the enlightened conservatives consider everything and question everything.  The Libs and the brainwashed normies work from a list of talking points, which makes for a very consistent worldview and story line.  Even at this site, look at the variety of viewpoints on things, from people who largely agree on the big picture.

            The Foundation Centerhas a good database of IRS Form 990s.  Search for your favorite racket, er charitable foundation then see how much they pay for managers, marketeers, fund-raisers, travel, vice how much actually goes to charity (often listed as “programs).  Most cut a check to a smaller charity at the end of the year (most states allow charities to maintain an overhead of 85%), which probably does the same 85% skim as the big name charity.  It is all just a jobs program for managerial class blowhards writing paeans for the cloud or extolling the civil religion (almost the same thing I’m starting to think).

        Yes.  There was a deliberate campaign to get Robert Mercer, a hedge fund guy who supported Trump and Bannon.  Multiple stories on the front page of the WSJ (important to that kind of person) suggesting he was a racist who hated black people etc and supported the kkk.
It was all total libel, hidden in the way they do it now.  “Mercer funds x, who many accuse of supporting white supremacy and racism.”  Or ending and starting a sentence like this: “… White Supremist.  Mercer…”

            The one upside of 3rd world and even some less organized  countries like Italy in the 70’s is sometimes even the rich can’t buy security with even with guards and gunsA few years ago in Venezuela I think ultra rich , think local versions of Kardeassians and the like were being snatched out of cars, kidnapped robbed and attacked even when they traveled with armed guards. They couldn’t trust the guards to die for themThey were all weepy and begging for outside help and all that.Now I like the Venezuelan people I’ve met but I kind of got a bit of Schandefruede when the government went Commie all over the region . Still lead to ruin now almost everyone including most the rich were screwed.Sow , Reap and for once no opting out of the consequences of policy choices for most rich/Perversely  order is the biggest problems the US faces, the Right is often  bad at political organizing without  beclowning themselves like the Bundies or being subverted by .Corp, The Left good at it but has terrible raw material and the .Gov  and .Corp out performs them allThis is changing, the .Gov and .Corp  is becoming the .Dumb and both groups will learn to shore up weaknesses, well maybe not the Left as much bad source material is hard to fix but this will allow a long overdo shift of power hopefully back to people and statesI think Judge Moore’s unwillingness to conceded, to make his foes pay for every inch is a good startFuture USA model should be “Give them nothing, take from them everything.”

        I usually learn more from the comments section than from articles on the internet. The fact is journalists, and liberal arts majors in general, are not very smart. They lean left because they’re “well educated” but don’t earn much money, so taxes don’t bother them. The worst are ivy league liberal arts majors (and lawyers) who think they’re smart, but possess no wisdom whatsoever. Morons like Obama and the Clintons probably couldn’t change a tire, or operate a circular saw if their lives depended on it.

        I’ve wondered myself about why political magazines are almost always shoestring affairs. Back when I was on the Left (the 1980s) I read The Nation. It was on cheap newsprint, almost no color printing, and they were always begging for donations above and beyond subscription prices. I also read many years ago that National Review, all things considered, didn’t have a very wide readership, despite WFB’s TV celebrity status. I guess despite how important political power is, there just aren’t very many people interested in the middlebrow commentary that such magazines offer.This post clarifies the money structure. The writers get their income from think tank fellowships, then publish at these magazines for pittance-level payments. I’ve also read that even the staff at many of these magazines come from money (or are married to money). They live in Manhattan, but their salary as “associate editor” is maybe $35,000 (just making that number up) at a rinky dink political magazine. No working-class person could afford to come live in NYC and make a living in such a position, so it is self-limiting to connected, well-off candidates for the job.ZMan has mentioned before that he is puzzled by people like Mike Cernovich. Who are they and where do they come from? I’ve wondered the same thing about many of the alt-Right YouTube personalities who seem to always be traveling to wherever there is a protest, or just sitting around making several videos per day commenting on politics. No sign of a day job or other obligations, but also the budget for international travel. I suspect either trust-fund kids (or adults) or secret funding from think tanks.

            Cerno has written about how he comes from poor white stock.  He graduated from law school, but the rumor is that he had some troubles passing the bar. Further gossip has it that his attorney wife did not have that difficulty, and after her options at a silicon valley start up came in the money, she and Cerno divorced. Cerno is rumored to have gotten a healthy six-figure settlement out of the deal.
He also wrote a couple of cheesy e-books with lots of typos, one of which is entitled “Gorilla Mindset.”

        My God, I had this flashback of when I used to read George Will on the last page of “Newsweek” when it came in the mail.My first real inkling that the media deck was stacked in favor of the Government Party was the 1992 election.  The “pro Bush” columns in Newsweek would trash Bush, but tell people they should do their conservative duty and vote for him.  The “anti Bush” columns were mainly just screeds by harpy leftists.It would take a few years for me to come to the realization that this was all a Government Party sham, and that the Bush’s weren’t really all that far removed from the editors at Newsweek…and that all of them went knocking on the same doors for money.You don’t become a billionaire without understanding the importance of cheap, expendable, labor, and the Thornton Mellon (“Back to School”) summary of how Big Business and Politics intersect.Therefore the uber rich will all, almost universally, be open borders absolutists.  And they will all kneel at the altar of Diversity…because even billionaires get tired of paying off $2.3M sexual harassment / discrimination lawsuits.  They have to get in bed with the Government Party because it’s basically running an organized crime protection racket.  (This is something Trump helpfully discusses quite a bit, such as his brilliant put-down of Gillbrand the other day…reminding everybody that she used to beg him for money not long ago.)So, in short, it’ll be tougher to get wealthy people to hide beyond 501c3’s to air alt righty sorts of ideas.  Not impossible, but tougher.  The path of least resistence, the path that doesn’t get you “outed” as a wrong-thinker and sued into oblivion by the Guardians of Approved Thought, is the path on the Left.

        Tyrell’s thing started out as an off campus college newspaper called The Alternative, which then added An American Spectator to the name, which then became The American Spectator. They were the guys who came up with the Nuke the Whales bumper sticker, combining hits on both the No Nukes and Save the Whales campaigns.
Those were fun days. Then with age, the fact of money and survival came in to spoil things.

        Interesting how much political orthodoxy dovetails with reactionary and evolian themes of anti-demos and ideological transcendence. Reaction views all signaling of the elite as abominable, but it is perfectly clear they have no intention of harming that which they view to be superlative. At bottom it is just another hierarchical order with more obfuscation than before.I think this sheds some light on how appeals to power are made and how progressive power can be undermined. Take that which the elite do not want from their signaling and amplify it. Take that which they do want and derive superior means to achieve it. The work of the rebel is to discover those broad categories and exploit them.

        Want to fix the schools?Start by abolishing Schools of Education. Graduates of these schools are immersed in total bullshit pedagogy and oft times have limited to non-existent knowledge of the subject material they are to teach.Wanna teach?Then require a real major in college and not a major specifically for “education majors.”(I have met some “education ” college students, and they are total morons; absolutely clueless and ignorant.Also bring back vocational training in schools; not everyone is interested in academic fields.Finally, allow all students to have access to “school choice” programs. Note that 1000% of those opposed to school choice do not have to send their kids to the crappiest of crappy inner city schools, but have no qualms about forcing black inner city kids to attend the worst schools on earth.Note that college professors (those not in the schools of Ed) do not take any training whatsoever in “teaching skills.”For what it’s worth, I was a TA in college (an engineering course). After the first semester of teaching the course, my preparation time for each class was about 5 minutes; no joke.After all, after one semester of teaching the same course, there is no way you do not know how to present the material in an effective manner to the students.(I was rated by the students every semester and the results went directly to my major professor. I was, literally, a straight “A” TA. )So, when you hear about teachers requiring hours for class prep. time, that is total bullshit or they are totally incompetent, in which case they should be fired.But then again, if they are ed. school grads, they most likely are incompetent.

            re: JohnTyler’s “Want to fix the schools?”
A bit off topic but welcome.
The actual way to fix Higher Education is IQ test every one who wants to go to college. If the score is 120 or higher the individual gets in. Most colleges and universities will shrink or close. Also, no government money allowed to support education is necessary as well.
To fix primary and secondary education abolish all school attendance laws, minimum age to work laws, and free public schools.

                    re: SAT/ACTs are IQ tests (hokkoda)Not really any longer. It was true pre 1970 but the test have been revised to eliminate the IQ components such as the Analogies. MENSA stopped using SAT scores for entry in the 1990s. Only the GREs verbal and math correlate with IQ as an 800 verbal snd 800 math give a 163 to 165 IQ, My sister, a retired medical school professor, who was on the admission committee for over 20 years told me the MCAT also was IQ loaded but the test ha been continually changed since the 1960s as the college boards have been to accommodate blacks and browns.Dan Kurt

        Some issues I have with all that, Z – perhaps you can clarify the fuzzy thinking:Flooding the nation with violent third world scum isn’t good for anyone – particualrly the rich white people you claim are responsible. Am I missing something there? (Not trying to be a dink – that just doesn’t make sense to me).And as far as rackets go – if I had money the last place I would invest it would be the media. As you and us fan boys demonstrate – the jig is up, nobody trusts them and a growing majority of us hold the media in utter contempt. Ratings are diving everywhere, and as far as pushing their interests – welp, Donald Trump WON AN ELECTION by giving the media and their handlers the finger.I think there is more in play here. You are obviously right about some of it but there are some annoying gaps in all this.

            The rich white people fear the people like you and me, and see the violent third world scum as being deployed against us, not them.
As to the media, we see it as worse than useless and actually a liability. They see it as the instrument of Soma and the way to perpetuate the brainwashing of the normies.  So far, it has worked fairly well for them.

            Zman has covered the reasoning behind the wealthy elite’s obsession with bringing the 3rd world into the West, from their civic religious fanaticism to the financial benefits they reap by driving wages lower and creating a nameless/faceless servile class.
The donors who pile money into these non-profit organizations have money to burn.  It’s not strictly about ‘investing’ in this case.  They can give a sizable donation to these foundations generating a nice tax break for themselves while at the same time financing the propaganda machine that helps keep them and their agenda in power.

            Rich people are human like the rest of us. When they are cut, they bleed. Granted, their blood is green and highly acidic, but the principle remains. Seriously, I think it is a combination of things. On the one hand, universalism and altruism have become a civic religion. These people literally get weepy when they see non-whites behaving like whites. It is a source of validation they get nowhere else. They truly believe they are making the world a better place with open borders.There’s also an ignorance factor. Walk through Bethesda Maryland, a plutocrat enclave outside DC, and you see something like a paradise. The people in these places, in these government jobs, running major corporations, they are sheltered from the consequences of their policy choices. They don’t see the little brown guys loitering by the Home Depot or outside the 7-11. They don’t know where we live or how we live. We are strangers to them.

                Did you read through those texts that the FBI clown, Strzok, was sending?  One of them was this:
Strzok/Page texts obtained by Fox’s @JakeBGibson – August 2016”PS – Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support…LP – Yep. Out to lunch with (redacted) We both hate everyone and everything.”
That’s very useful insight into the mind of your average D.C. bureaucrat.

                Drive south out of Frederick MD toward the Beltway, after hours of weary travel through the dying towns of western NY and PA, and see – especially after dark – the Oz-like opulence of Tyson’s Corners, and you know that you’ve crossed the border into an alt-world, a land of the Stepford Wives.

                    I tell my Tyson’s II Mall story a lot this time of year.  In 2009, as the recession was peaking, mall stores back home were boarded up, people looking for jobs, etc. I was in D.C. on business in Tyson’s Corner.  I decided to pick up something for my wife for Christmas at Tyson’s II.  It was a Friday, and the mall was packed.  Everyone had bags of goodies, the restaurants all had lines for seating.  It was another world.  I went back home and wrote on facebook, “There is no recession in Government.”

            “As you and us fan boys demonstrate – the jig is up, nobody trusts them and a growing majority of us hold the media in utter contempt.”I think those of us in the TRUE resistance overlook the fact that we, as well as libtards and neocons, exist in an echo chamber vacuum. I bet if we looked at the source of most of our information, we would find we tend to visit sites that circulate the same themes and information. Yes, there is a difference, and I think that our friends tend to be like minded as well. So, we miss things that we would see if we had other forms of information. Have you noticed the Roy Moore issue? It is already disappearing from conservative and alt-right sources. But, the left is still flogging the dead horse of “Russian hacking” and can’t let go of the fact Trump won. If you are reality oriented, you realize things like “don’t cry over spilled milk” or “sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me!” The left and the “respectable” cucks never forget, never ignore, and never give up as long as there are still echo chambers they can retreat to. I noticed that Disney is purchasing Fox now. Fox has been cucked since before Murdoch retired, but it will now be full blown social warrior. And what percentage of the nominally conservative viewers will notice? I continue to be impressed by Trump’s effortless triggering of snowflakes, but I have to admit that buying out the opposition is just as good a strategy, if you have a rich uncle to do it for you.

                Remember the great ‘autopsy’ after Romney’s 2012 loss?  Conservatism Inc. is STILL fixated on their “Brownify to Victory” theory.  I think they’re trying to engineer losses just so they can justify going back and forcing everyone to implement their cockamamie plan.  Because their credo is “We are always right”, no matter what.

            Imagine a rich guy living in a gated community in a town with a rapidly growing Hispanic population. He’s pleased to learn that the Guatemalan maids will work for less than the blacks or prole whites he used to employ, and they actually do a better job. His standard of living is going up, so what’s everybody bitching about? And if they don’t like it, why don’t they just get rich and move to the gated community?Now imagine the rich guy’s “gated community” is Manhattan or northern Virginia or Malibu.You think the rich people have more to lose because they have a larger economic stake in America (or the West in general), but Western economies are becoming increasingly extractive. You like your nation, it’s your home, and you want to see it continue to do well. But rich white people, especially (((rich white people))), don’t see themselves as citizens of a nation. They’ve transcended that. When we complain about manufacturing jobs being offshored or illegals undercutting wages, they’re disgusted. Why are we trying to wreck their good thing? Why don’t we just become billionaires and start going to Davos?As for the media, well Slim and Bezos don’t invest in floundering newspapers because they think it will directly make them money. That’s what their monopolies are for. They just want to hold the megaphone.Third world immigrants are politically powerless, and generally uninterested in civic participation anyways. Re-racinated wypipo though? That’s a real problem.

        I remember coming across a rumor online during the 2012 election to the effect that Mittens had set up a bunch of phony “Excellence in Journalism” foundations to funnel money to outlets like National Review to buy positive coverage.  I really have no evidence that something like this happened, but given what The Z-man has found it certainly seems to be a possibility.  That year in fact was when I lost nearly all my respect for NR because they were being such obsequious rump swabbing lickspittles when it came to Rombleycare.  If they were actually bought and paid for at the time, it would certainly explain their otherwise inexplicable decision to pretend that Mitt was the most conservative man in the race.
