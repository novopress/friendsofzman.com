        Casting Denzel Washington in the role Edward Woodward created was silly and unserious in any case.

        The last verified lynchings in the US took place in Duluth, Minnesota in 1920–a fact that gets trotted out by Duluth media in an annual display of self-flagellation.

        Washington hasn’t fallen under my bar, which, being an actors bar, is set on a curve, making it very, very low bar. The Romans got this one right, putting slaves, gladiators, and actors in the same social class. Gladiators and actors enjoyed their celebrity and renumeration while accepting their place.A good actor is a good liar and manipulator, and we tend to do the things that we are exceptionally good at.Washington is an above average fellow, given the genre. We have a duty to not take actors for more than the scum they are, and that failure is entirely ours.

        Whiskey does a great take-down of the new EQUALIZER over at his blog.  Looks like a real stinker, so Washington is probably trying to gin up some fake controversy to attract some attention.  Odd that this tough guy actor is promoting his tough guy movie by portraying himself as a nervous Nellie and timorous weakling.I was going to check the flick out, but not now.  Denzel just alienated the few white people who may have been inclined to purchase a ticket.  Boston is an odd choice of venue to insult white people.  Washington hedges his bet by insulting working class whites who live in Dorchester, but that won’t fly.  You can get away with this kind of crap in the South, but not in Boston.I don’t get it.  Washington is usually smarter than this.  While not a great actor, he is unquestionably a great star, a stoic masculine figure, sort of a black Clint Eastwood.  Like Tom Cruise before he went insane, Washington has been careful not to alienate any part of his potential audience.  He’s not Spike Lee. He’s a Christian, unashamedly devout, and still married to his first wife, with whom he has 4 kids.  He doesn’t need to pull this kind of crap.  Has he lost it?  Mid life crisis?  Is this his Mel Gibson moment?  Probably not; denigrating working class whites won’t get you blacklisted.  But still, the bloom may be off the rose.

            Something seems to go wrong with aging stars leading them to say and do insanely stupid things. I’ve always suspected that the huge amounts of money they get for doing nothing useful warps their thinking. Maybe by late middle age it blooms into full blown insanity. Danny Glover went crazy around this age. Mel Gibson. I think Woody started raping his kids around his fifties.I do like Denzel as an actor, but this pity party stuff frosts me no end. There’s no better place to be black than America. Denzel is proof of that and should be proud of it. Instead he insults his countrymen for no good reason.
