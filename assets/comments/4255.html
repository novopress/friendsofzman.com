        British elections aren’t a fixed term, though they cannot exceed five years. It is possible for a government to ask the Monarch to dissolve parliament before the term is up. Disastrously for the Tories in 1974, Edward Heath misjudged the timing for an election and let Labour in to run a minority government. Cameron clearly decided he wouldn’t make that mistake and has taken the current term to the limit.Anyhow, be that as it may, we may well here be faced with yet another coalition government when the shambles is sorted out. The general feeling is that UKIP despite their popular appeal won’t get enough seats to replace the Limp Dumbs in a coalition and anyway they are too toxic for the ‘I’m almost a socialist Dave’ to link up with.Miliband, often referred to here as Beaker for his unfortunate resemblance to one of the Muppets, is desperate for power (aren’t they all?) and is apparently wooing the SNP largely as the the vote on which Labour traditionally relies in Scotland is likely to go Ms Sturgeon’s way. Beaker would happily sacrifice the UK’s small nuclear defence ability by shooing the vital submarines out of some Scottish loch, because that’s what Sturgeon wants and the strange man needs her in a coalition. The Limp Dumbs by the way would almost certainly flock to Liebore’s side as socialism is their natural bent. It’s been hard for them cosying up to an almost-left-of-centre Tory party. Meanwhile Wales rumbles on about wanting to be independent and a swing to the Grok-speakers would ruin Liebore’s traditional vote in the vallies.The Toadies would find themselves without any friends other than what Norn Iron can rustle up.I don’t know whether the SNP really want independence. Whitehall coughs up a lot of cash to keep them happy and now that oil is not the gold it once was then Sturgeon needs the hated English money to realise her vision of Venezuela-On-The-Clyde.In the meantime while there have been the odd muzzie trouble north of the border I am not sure the Scots have any great feelings towards immigrants. The Scots, as one of them once said to me, only care about money and London has it for the moment.UKIP wants us out of Europe, but every other party wants us in. That means that even if UKIP managed to get enough seats to prop up Cam’s probably minority government he and the rest of the Eurofans won’t want to split from Brussels. That leaves little for UKIP to build a deal around, and promised referendums come and go without ever seeing the light of day. Mind you, it could be like the Paddys who had to vote again because they inadvertently pressed the ‘leave the EU’ button a few too many times in their referendum. Bizarrely I recall one Liebore politician insisting the original vote for no in Eire was actually a cry for more EU rule and was merely dissatisfaction of the slim rule coming from Brussels. More was better, she said, and that was what they got. Funny how our leaders see things…You are right the Toadies have run out of reasons to exist. The other day Dave weirdly announced a plan for businesses to grant paid leave to workers wishing to do ‘community work’ and other socially joyful things instead of their job. Business, once the cornerstone of the Cons, wanted to know who pays for this largesse (councils would embrace it because, hey, who cares about the people they serve?) but business — who might want to make a profit to carry on — would have to stump up the cash. The Toadies also didn’t know how this could be enforced. No doubt the police will be told to go round and arrest bosses refusing to allow their workers to slope off and pick litter for a few days.All this makes it hard to vote for any of the parties come election time. The tragedy of politics now is that it has become a sort of lumpen blob of fuzzy feelings and sparkly unicorn wishes. They all love us, all have plans for us to be happy and wealthy and none of them have any real idea what makes the world tick. Money is just numbers to be bounced round and so what if the proles don’t like mass immigration and all the huge costs involved?When UKIP’s Farage said in a TV debate that the majority of the HIV treatment in the UK was for health tourists, not UK residents, there were horrified gasps from the gathered lefties. So what in our feel-good world if we aren’t treating diseased people from all over? UKIP’s argument it is a national health service and not an international one has fallen on disbelieving ears.Just as sadly so will all the promises in this coming general election fall on deaf ears because they are all vague promises and unreal dreams. Unless you think one lot will give your bit of the rabble more than another lot will, there is little point in voting. My interest in this election will be just how many people think it is actually worth getting out of their armchairs and trying to have a say in the tumbling collapse of the nation. It will be interesting.

            One of the benefits of Americans watching BBC coverage of the UK elections is we see that we are not the only people who have lost their minds. Your elections are just as tedious and inane as our elections. I just snapped on the tube and the BBC was yakking with some American nobodies about Hillary Clinton’s campaign. I’m getting rid of TV for the next 18 months. There’s simply no way I can stand watching election coverage for a year and a half.
