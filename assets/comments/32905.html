        I was just out of college when the Iraq war started.  It has been surreal to see people who went on foaming at the mouth rants about the Bush Administration support a candidate who touts her endorsement from Dick Cheney.  All war was bad to them back then, now they can’t wait for the start of World War 3.

            I have an old friend with terminal TDS, bad enough that I’m pretty sure she would have cast me out as a friend if we saw each other regularly, but she lives across the country so contact is rare. She was always a lefty, but that used not to matter in personal relationships. 15 years ago she thought Bush/Cheney were Satan incarnate, was a member of Code Pink if I’m not mistaken, and then during the J6 hearings she told me Liz ought to be president. I have made no attempt to reason with her, believing that futile. For other unrelated reasons, I am pretty sure she is insane, but she married my oldest friend who I’ve known since I was 4. He has become a horribly TDS infected militantly pro jab bugman soycuck. At least together they produced 4 white kids, two of whom have also reproduced, so it hasn’t been a total waste.

                    Don’t give up. It is possible that the 4 kids and the grandkids could return the favor and be traitors to the parents and the cause they serve. In fact, there is probably a huge pool of White youth in whose faces are smacked constantly by the reality that they inhabit the world as second class citizens and minorities. They are now and are going to be extremely angry at their parents and grandparents for what they have done.No doubt, many will capitulate and go the route that Walz is offering. They are unhealthy and dead ends. There are many who are healthy and will arrive on the healthy side of the divide.

                        AFAIC, this is all just supposition. We really have no idea what will happen to the children and grandchildren of white Leftists. What we do know is that for most white Leftists, no slap of reality, no matter how clear and painful, will dislodge them from their treasonous madness.

                            If you are a die hard hereditarian and tend to subscribe to the “spiteful mutants” theory of Dutton and Woodley, then you’d have to predict a greater than even odds that these children *will* take on the adverse aspects of their bat shit crazy parents.

                                Yep. But its also true of die-hard nurture fans. After a couple beers and a talk that goes into the wee hours, I can see the light coming on a bit in some of my nephews as they reconsider what they had been told were axiomatic truths, but by the next morning, their mental defenses spring shut, protecting them from wrongthink.
Either way…

                            Read Matt Bracken’s third book (blue cover) called “Foreign Enemies and Traitors.”
I just finished it up, and it paints a realistic picture of the balkanization of the U.S., after a major natural disaster (two major back-to-back earthquakes along the New Madrid fault, in southeastern Missouri).
The kneegrows get shot on sight, because it didn’t take long for people to understand &amp; see how quickly they go feral.
Other sub-plots are really interesting and prescient. It was published in 2009.

                            Hey there OK. I appreciate all of your comments here. Very good posts consistently.For the young people who are on the right side, I have no supposition. I know many who are. I know of none who are traitors, though I know many exist.Sadly, a significant number will capitulate and not make the selection. They will avoid the struggle and this is precisely why they will capitulate. Still, many, and I know many already, embrace the struggle because they refuse to capitulate. Mostly this is because they are properly spirited and a few just understand how dire it will be after capitulation.There is a lot of reason for optimism. We just have to focus on those reasons and the people who are more reason for optimism. Good things are happening and many young people are up for the long and difficult road ahead.

                        Indeed, it is unknown how the kids will turn out, regardless of what they are now. When I was their age I was a colorblind civnat. What I do know is that for our purposes, it is better for white leftists to have kids than not to have them.

                        Correct. It’s not just the kids. I am 60 years old and my shitlib parents and in laws drove me nuts with their entitled bullshit. How old is Z? He’s an old fart too.
The problem we face is we have to stop pissing and moaning and noticing and griping. We have to ACT. We have to unify. We need to quit with the defeatism and doom and gloom.
I am confident at some point we will, and the casualties on both sides are going to be horrendous… but hopefully our grandkids will have a world worth living in afterward.

                            This is absolutely correct Filthie. On a very positive note, the difference between a year ago and today in terms of people having acted and continuing to act in forming real communities and real projects is tremendous. Seeds that I sewed a few years ago now have the first site of buds at the base of a couple of branches.We are acting and we will continue to do so. Our job is to act and think in 10, 50 and 500 year time frames. We act to build something or buy something that will be here for Our folk 500 years from now. We act to build that mindset so that 500 years from a large number of Our posterity still hold that mindset. We act to get some immediate and meaningful progress in the realm of network building, skill and wealth development, spiritual and physical virility and strength. We are prepared for calamity and disaster, but we act with the confidence and belief that this well contemplated and righteous action with and for Our people will lead to success and glory.Things are moving in a positive direction for those who started moving a few years ago. In 5 years things will be even better for those who started a while ago, and for those who start today.As much despair and darkness as there is and that is coming, the first test is to take action that is in defiance to it. We will never submit.

                    I got kicked off of a Facebook page for the area I grew up in for making one of my typical off color jokes.Our high school sports teams suck these days as the ghetto has slowly moved in, whereas they were pretty decent back in the old days when we were a farm school. All I said was, “You’d think with all the ghetto kids moving there, that we’d be tops in sports … We must have gotten all the black kids who suck at sports.”… You’re a racist!!! Blah blah blah …Oh yeah, it was a white woman chastising me.

                    I just can’t abide with these people. They’re damaged and broken. It’d be one thing if they kept to themselves, but they can’t stop wanting to either convert you to their satanic “faith” or have you killed because you are a racist/sexist/bigot/homophobe. Disagreement with the progressive project makes you an unperson to them, scary, because we all know where that leads.It’s a balm to your sanity not to have to deal with these people. Kudos to you for having the courage to cast out evil.Like Kyle Reese said in the original Terminator that definitely applies to progressives:It can’t be bargained with. It can’t be reasoned with. It doesn’t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop… ever, until you are dead!Progressives are like that. When they’re plugged into the Progressive collective consciousness, they cease to be individuals. To them, resistance is futile.

                        I disagree in small part: they do feel fear. They know they have crossed lines. That doesn’t meant for a picosecond that they are openly acknowledging any wrongdoing or error, just that events are not going according to expectations. There is no repentance and they aren’t going to change, so the end game is the same: separation/partition or knockdown/dragout to see who gets to continue to exist.The same kind of thing happened after the European working class rejected communism after World War 1. The communists luminaries were ASTONISHED. “But we are the vanguard of the proletariat! Damn the proletarians for rejecting us!” They went through a several year period of what can be called a movement-wide ‘after action report’. They changed tactics from preparation for violent revolution to seizing control from within, cultural degradation of both working and rule class institutions, etc. The Coudenhove-Kalergi miscegenation lunacy comes from this era.

                        Yes.  This has been my experience with my former Leftie friends.  It was brutal dumping them because some of them are kind, generous people with many good qualities.They are however staunchly and rabidly dialectic, and the response to my disagreement with them on any issue elicits You can’t possibly be on the side of Reagan!  (Ford! Bush! Trump! etc.)  To me, this is willful cowardice in the face of a complex world.  I also resented and despised their coercive bullying attempts.  That’ll get my blood running hot.I am a Christian, of the Church Militant.  My fealty is to the truth, because my God is the embodiment of ultimate Truth, including offensive and hard truths that the world hates to hear.Lefties differ from Righties in that Lefties LIVE their politics; it is indistinguishable from the balance of their entire lives.  They go to Affinity Group meetings religiously.  They march, they opine publicly, they canvass neighborhoods, they bleed blue.  However, they are willing to go blind to obvious truths in service of ideo-political hegemony, and they are most comfortable blending-in with The Herd.  I hate this.To Righties, politics is ancillary and rarely integrated with the balance of their lives.  Righties are not all-in and passionate about ideology and politics, divorcing it from day-to-day exigencies, and so they lose.  And lose.  Part-time dabblers inevitably get run over by full-time professionals.A good example: the massively attended Pussy Hat marches and rallies.  Progressivism/feminism suffuses the lives of these persons; it is the core of their identity.  Measured arguments by trads and conservatives are drowned-out and wilt — and fail — in the face of that.Live your convictions, no matter the cost.

                    I appreciate the sentiment, but it seems pointless to “dump” someone who lives over a thousand miles away and I see maybe once every other year at most. They provide me the service of a window into the madness, which I might otherwise lack.

                    I had them right in my family and I did the same. It got to the point where we hated each other and were skating around the truth of it, not wanting to admit it… but at some point ya gotta be you and live your life and have your own morality and ethics just like they do.I got thrown out the airlock and spent most of the last ten years on my own… but there are signs breaking that maybe some kind of co-existence might be possible. My shit lib parents and in-laws are speaking to me again and letting me help them in their old age – and those assholes are being respectful for the most part.My kidult gay hipster daughter is still in the winds and after 10 years of ghosting us… I just don’t care anymore. If she wants to repent and straighten out, fine. Otherwise she is just someone I used to know.

                        Yes. This is one of the absurdities of the age, and probably one that always accompanies mass democracy and is greatly exacerbated by a multi-ethnic democracy where power is left up for grabs after being abandoned by the majority.I had a case where the wife’s best friend’s fiancee is a massive shitlib. He is very belligerent too. I had a situation where I got hot over the looming forced vaccination and this toad’s promotion of it, and lost my cool. After a cooling out period, I became the bigger man and led with an apology and offered the peace pipe. That offer was in the form of, “Let’s never discuss politics again.” No sooner than that was accepted this Trotskyite said, “America is no longer a White Christian country.” Then to vomit on that s*** sandwhich said, “I am now an ardent Zionist. I will do everything for Israel from now on.”Needless to say, I swallowed a ‘decapitation after a long and arduous crucifixion’ level rage and led a toast to everyone and their homeland. I think I was the only one who got it.Nonetheless the tension exists. Everyone is miffed by it, and some raise it at times. I finally at least got many to understand by each time someone came and said something I said something like:“Do you recall that brunch at so-and-so’s house? Do you understand what so-and-so was really saying? No? Okay. Well, flip the names. What if Israel was 500 years old? What if I came to Israel as an immigrant and was raised on its welfare state? Then I spent my entire life acting against America and Americans as a radical leftist. Then, I told an Israeli whose family goes back 300+ years to the formation of that country and fought in all its wars and survived and contributed to its well being through all of its crisis – ‘This is no longer a Jewish and Judaeic country. Btw, I am now an ardent Sino-ist! I am going to do everything I can to vote for Israel’s resources to support China!’ That effectively is what so-and-so did that day after I offered him the peace pipe.So. You see, this is the net effect of life in a multi-ethnic democracy. You have something in common with him besides politics so you can put aside political differences. Me, well, he told me to my face after using my country’s resources his entire life that this is no longer the country of my people and our religion. We don’t belong sitting politely across the dinner table together. We belong kitted up standing across the battlefield from each other locked in mortal combat over the existence of my people and our homeland. That democracy forces mortal enemies to politely exchange votes and to sideline turn issues that can only be settled by combat into ballot box competition is beyond absurd. That absurdity is breaking. Trump/Woke, Red/Blue is only just the beginning of where we are headed. Everyone is lucky that I swallow my rage and still hold a polite countenance and manner when we do all meet up. He is the luckiest of all of you on that account.”I have to say, that every person who I told this to, agreed with me. Now, when I have to hold that rage, they are on my side. I think they are all gulping and realizing the future that is looming for their children and grandchildren. These issues aren’t going away and they know it.If I can offer any advice here to anyone who either has to end their marriage and/or renounce your family or swallow these sorts of issues with a smile it is this. Number one, if you love your family, don’t do it. Number two, realize that these are existential conflicts over things that most likely require mortal combat to settle and so debates and voting are absurdities that the system is forcing the lid upon. Lose no sleep once you accept this reality. In your daily prayers/rituals pray for the opportunity to end this system and get kitted up and face these enemies on the field of battle and resolve yourself to be the winner.Pray for temperance and wisdom so that when you meet these people at the table that you understand that this situation is absurd and just let that anger go. It isn’t the other person’s fault that we are in this situation that is beyond absurd. They are all caught up in it and just as unconscious of the nature of the conflict and how absurd debate and voting are in trying to resolve it. Know that if the proper method were in play, there would likely be a surrender on their side long before you had to do the needful. Pray for your preparations to be adequate and blessed, and pray for the will to do the needful should that terrible day ever arise.Then, do everything you can in every moment of every day, to be in a position of optimal strength as we continue the descent into the Kali Yuga. This will steel you. It will also end the need to engage in debates much less win them. Disengagement from this game knowing it is absurd and the wrong game for settling the issues at hand is healthy. Thinking of this as disengaging from the game will help you not disengage from friends and family when most are good and just want to get on with life.It may be that once you have built a castle or a humble redoubt, you may attract some family to your cause. Perhaps they will come over when in a time of need you are the one able to help them. Then you will be in a position to say yes or no based on their ability to deliver what you need from them to be a part of it. Maintaining that noble countenance in the face of the healthy and understandable rage will go a long way toward your health, your sanity, your ability to take constructive action while not making any unnecessary enemies.Democracy is a tragedy. All of these dining table conflicts are a symptom of it. It is very very difficult to do, but the noble way is to rise above it with the proper mindset.

                        Yes, brutal indifference toward family who have succumbed to the mind virus is necessary and healthy, a kind of N-95 mask for the souI. I have three brothers, two of whom morphed into shitlibs in middle age and are now insufferable pricks. At gatherings, the rest of us finesse conversation into safe channels, steering talk away from politics, to avoid scenes. But these two, they can’t help themselves. After two or three glasses of boxed wine, the shitlibbery oozes out, as from a festering buboe, usually with some passive-aggressive snark, starting with stuff like “Well, I get that you Trump people hate gays, but…” Yeah, sure, Merry Christmas to you too, asshole…*Anyway, it’s a mystery:  We all grew up in the same house, same parents, same town, similar IQ profiles, paid our taxes, earned our retirements, and yet here we are, all in the autumn of life, split 2-2 on the most fundamental issues of our time. Thing is, they couldn’t say what these fundamental issues are. All they know is that WE MUST DEFEAT TRUMP!!*Of course “we Trump people” could play their game, and start a chat with “So, what is it with you Harris people that you are so into killing babies?” But we don’t. We’re too nice, dammit…

                            Yes this has been my experience also. If I disagree that mass-immigration is healthy and feminism is liberatingly wonderful, then I must be on the side of (fill in name of leading rightie figure).  It is kneejerk dialecticism.  Either I agree, or I am of the Enemy.
However, I left nice behind a long time ago, and do not suffer fools.

                                Yep. America 2024:If you aren’t on the side of the angels, you are Hitler.It wasn’t like this forty years ago. The attitude was, to quote Dave Mason,there ain’t no good guy,they’re ain’t no bad guy,there’s only you and me and we just disagree.Adults differed on issues, but not on the fundamentals of a healthy society. No garden variety liberal in 1980, or even 1990, supported infanticide, open borders, suppression of free speech, the sexual mutilation of children, global warfare, big Pharma, homosexual triumphalism, lawless chaos in cities, rampant police-state antics from Federal three-letter agencies, or repeated assassination attempts on federally unapproved candidates for office. Heck, I am so old that I remember whenthey were against all this stuff.**In fairness, shitlibs typically don’t know they are for these things; they really only know one thing:Orange Man Bad. I kind of envy them; they don’t lose sleep over the future of their society. All they “know” is that, by subscribing to the New YorkTimes, listening to NPR, building their pension funds, and enrolling their kids in “good schools”, they are in facton the side of the angels. And that defeating theOrange Hitleris a grim but essential task…

                    This.  How can you call someone a ‘friend’ who wants you dead and your children raped and thinks it’s funny?  And for everyone here who says he used to be a civnat, I guarantee there are quadruple the number who became shitlibs in college.  And they stay that way, and so do their kids.  Everyone my husband and I used to know in the fedgov – all at least moderately ‘conservative’ and many former military – has become a civnat at best, and their kids are all flaming globalists.  Lots of girlbosses, careerists, a few sexual degenerates, and almost zero grandchildren.Cut them all loose.  They are  nothing but dead weight.

                    As previously stated, cutting them out of my life would change very little, as they are already far away. We haven’t even texted in 2 months, which is normal. And it wouldn’t cause any realizations or reflections on anybody’s part… “Our old friend cut us off over politics, so sad, blah blah” you hear those stories all the time, and nobody really cares. Big deal. But, if someday they need me, and I’m not there for them, that could leave a mark. Not exactly revenge, but served cold. If and when I “disown” them, I will make it count for something. I’m a patient man.

            I hope Zman writes the companion piece to today’s essay about the disappearance of the old Left, which is almost as weird. I was against W/Cheyney’s Iraq War and I thought I would go to the protest. The train to the City was full of pink-haired Woodstock types and assorted freaks who obviously hated America. I would rather be dead than march with these fools. So I went to Belmont instead. It is impossible for me to believe that these same freaks would support Liz Cheney and more wars. But in America today, anything is possible it seems.

                Yes. While the power of propaganda media is greatly diminished, it is still very powerful even if no longer a monopoly. These leftists, who tend to be older now, formulate their opinions based on what they see and are told through neocon mouthpieces. A green shoot is many younger people, primarily but not exclusively men, consume different information sources and come to correct and apposite conclusions.

            And the flip side of this is that many of us who supported the Sand Wars of the 90s and 00s are now borderline isolationists if not pacifists. The transition from America to AINO occasioned a polar reversal in politics

                The sand wars were proof to rational thinking folk of the futility of the assumption that “everyone” can be an American and will assume American values if only allowed to.  Boomers came about their thinking in the after effects of WWII, Korea, and the stalemate of the Cold War.  Very little evidence to the contrary in those formative years.  Indeed, we could have prosperity at home and continuous war abroad for all we saw. (War is the health of the State? As Bourne said waay back when.)The (endless) sand wars were a boon to rational thinking Boomers—albeit toward the end of life and influence for our cohort.  Millennials and Z’s should not be under such delusion—especially since they are now experiencing the inevitable poverty that endless wars bring.  Gen X’ers I have no opinion on.

                    True.  I felt an odd thrill at the sight of the purple thumbs on Iraqis who had voted after their “liberation”.  But ultimately it was a great lesson on the futility of extreme egalitarianism, a lesson that the Cold War couldn’t have so easily imparted.On a side note, does anyone remember the blogger “Chrenkoff”, back in the mid 2000’s?  He was allegedly a Polish immigrant living in Australia, who used to post often-massive summaries on a daily basis of all the wonderful things the GAE was doing to rebuild Iraq.  Until suddenly one day he was gone and had apparently landed a government position Down Under.  Looking back on him, he was quite clearly an asset and was wittingly or unwittingly serving as stenographer for someone in the Neocon Project.

                        No, but there was an interesting website populated with stories by returning vet’s from Iraq. (I forget the name) To be part of the process on the ground (winning hearts and minds) is like seeing the old movie, “Catch 22”. I learned more about racial inequity from that blog than anywhere else.

                        I used to read him. Thanks for the jolt to the memory — really takes me back. Back ca. 2003/4/5 when blogging was this new and amazing thing, I was really into: American Digest (how I found my way here, eventually IIRC), Chrenkoff, Neo Neocon (I was young and stupid), and Samizdata.net (a nest of City of London Finance assholes and Ziolovers into Austrian Economics).In other words used to be a clueless idiot. These days more a clued-in idiot.Chrenkoff is on X posting under his own name. Can pretty much predict his angle on anything without going there. Not much has changed. Never saw a Russian he didn’t want to send a tank round downrange at. Loves the Special People, picture of Reagan at the top of his twitter feed, etc., etc.Probably wasn’t an asset so much as an Australian Liberal (== the supposed conservatives.. it is to laugh of course) Party staffer who having put in his grunt work years got offered some ministerial advisory position and had to stop blogging for the duration.

                Yes. I supported the sand wars because I believed the lie that they were about our national security. Turned out that was completely false. Who let the 9/11 hijackers into the country and allowed them to take flight lessons? The government did. Who let the Boston Marathon bombers into the country — and gave them welfare? The government did. No need to invade Iraq when you can simply deny visas to Saudis and Chechens, right?How many “terror” attacks were committed in the U.S. by the Taliban? ZERO. Yet “Mad Dog” Mattis, who was hired by Trump, said it was “fun” to shoot them because of how they treated their women.The greatest threats to our national security are in D.C., Tel-Aviv, Manhattan and San Francisco.

                As someone who unfortunately hauled a lot of flag-draped caskets out of Iraq in a C-130, I admit I supported what Borat correctly termed “your war of terror.” I was like much of our officer corps in the 1990s, a Republican normie who didn’t know any better.Now, we need to leave everyone alone and be left alone. No more “invade the world and invite the world.”I don’t give a damn about Israel. Or Iraq. Or Iran. Or Ukraine. Or Russia. Or China. Or wherever the neocon warmongers tell you to affix your attention. Let’s sweep behind our own back step before we go out and try to remake the world in our twisted image.

                    Ditto.  I was another lifelong GOP voter who enthusiastically supported the Sand Wars because I bought into the largely unexamined assumption that the GAE needed to maintain its “global influence” because, uh…uhmm…reasons.  Looking back, it was like being on autopilot from the Cold War.Watching the war effort sputter and unravel made it obvious that the policy (the entire GAE worldview, really) was built on a foundation of false assumptions and hidden agendas. At the same time, I became increasingly disgusted by my community being flooded with foreigners, the official policy of Hate Whitey, and the normalization of Woke degeneracy.  I may be slow on the uptake, but you’d have to be in a coma not to be red-pilled.

            I am totally baffled by it and I suspect a lot of people are. Dick Cheney is one of the worst Americans to ever live and Liz is committed to living up to his legacy. She is so committed to it that she holds up one of the most stunning congressional defeats in history as a badge of honor. As long as the USA protests and elevates these people, the future is less bright. Even if I had total TDS, I would say that the Dick Cheney endorsement is a total deal breaker for Kamala.

        Even Putin is baffled by all this. In a recent interview, Putin basically said that elections here don’t matter because of the entrenched neocon bureaucracy. That said, I think there’s an important distinction to be made. Trump is pro-Israel, but he’s not a Globalist. The neocons are Globalists. This is their main beef with Trump and why they’ve found a new home in the Globohomo left. They won’t be happy until Moldova, Georgia and other places we can’t find on a map have pride parades and African immigrants.

            Is Moldova really a country?  I’m skeptical.  It sounds more like a yeasty genital condition of the skanky white women that actually do rule all your institutions.  :O)
‘Neocons’ may dominate the Forever Wars apparatus, DOD/Pentagon and whatnot.  But they don’t run your institutions, and neither does Israel.  Look closer to home.  Moldova runs those.

                    Most EE women are, comparatively speaking. They are poor so don’t have the benefit of gorging themselves to obesity on high fructose corn syrup derivatives. So, by definition, they are usually thin &amp; fit. They also are largely on the prowl to escape said poverty so put careful thought into their appearance unlike these fat little entitled American piglets running around in Ugg boots and their pajamas faces full of metal and virtue signaling neon ‘danger hair’ dyes.And the two Moldovans I met in DC, back in the day, were also above average and pretty hot, respectively.Sadly, in a week I am back in the sewer for a bit so am taking in the sights right now while I am still able. God willing, my next foray back to southern &amp; eastern Europe will be at a much longer interval.

                        Edward Dutton has a theory (he’s got a lot of them) that the reason Soviet and Ukrainian women are so hot is because of WWII male casualties.  For example, the male cohort born in 1920 in Russia were almost all killed during the war.  Dutton’s theory (perhaps only tongue-in-cheek) is that the few surviving males had their pick of the young and good looking females left, while the ugly ones could not find husbands.There is a bit to support this theory as I’ve read old Soviet newspapers spreading the *then* government propaganda line that the newly married men should not “forget” the unmarried women who are husbandless—a not so subtle plea for single motherhood for the good of Mother Russia.   😉

He is thrilled to be away from the ‘new military’ Prog indoctrinations and strictures that weighed him down in the States.  A happy chappie now.

                No, but their close cousins – the neoliberals – DO run the institutions. Predictably, they are starting to fail.That is something we have to remember in all this chit and doom poasting… the Israelies – or jews – are rapidly uniting their enemies against them. If Iran cuts loose on Israel – they are done. Others will be drawn into the fray and once they’re gone… a lot of world problems go with them. Any way you cut it none of this bodes well for the jews. We will HAVE to break ties with them at some point or those ties will be broken for us. I think we’re smarter than that – in the long run. In the short term… there’s a lot of very stupid people that need killing, and Darwin, Murphy and God are going to have their day with them.

        The GAE/ZOG has always been a totalitarian, global, Zionist, Trotskyite undertaking, which is why it commenced the Cold War against its former Bolshevik ally.There is no place in the world where GAE/ZOG does not feel morally entitled to intervene with military, economic, or political interference, all for the promotion of radical egalitarianism, hedonism, consumerism, pornography, feminism, homosexuality, and abortion. “Multiculturalism” is a farce — GAE/ZOG will make war on any culture that challenges it.The claim that GAE/ZOG does this for “democracy” and the “will of the people” is patently fraudulent. If you are a Hitler, Mossadegh, Yanukovich, or Hamas and you were democratically elected, GAE/ZOG will make war on you and kill you. It will not hesitate to kill your five-year-old children by carpet-bombing them to death with nuclear weapons if need be.Properly understood, GAE/ZOG is an anti-Christian, global communist empire. The Iranians are right — it really is the Great Satan.

                Why not, though? I have no truck with the Iranians. Sure, I remember 1979, but they did that because of the Zionist influence on the U.S. Just like the Saudi oil embargo.Look, Iran is a theocracy and I have no interest in living under Shia Islam, but they are no threat to me here if we leave them alone over there. Do Iranians have queers in bondage leather marching down the street waving dildoes? Are they the worlds’ leading distributor of pornography? Are their daughters tattooed, pierced whores fucking dozens of random dudes and having abortions? Is half their country stoned and/or obese? Are their young men paying money to jerk off to Jewish-created OnlyFans? Is their economy based on money-printing, usury, inflation, debt, and offshoring jobs to China? How many fentanyl addicts are living on their streets?Seems that I have less disagreement with Iran than I do with ZOG…

        I’m a lifelong conservative and remember this well. In the late 1970s, the neocons were welcomed into the movement because they became strong anti-communists at a critical time when Jimmy Carter was “soft on communism.” We welcomed them because we conservatives, real type, needed allies. The Soviet were on the march in Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua. It helped Irving Kristol and others at The Public Interest wrote trenchant, data-laden critiques of the Great Society. And as “ex-“Trotskyites they knew communism from the inside. After they gained major posts in the Reagan administration, and the funding spigots at the major foundations, they took over Buckley conservatism. Then the Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia, as Joe Sobran put it at the time, went back to being Russia. But the neocons stayed, until c. 2015, as you noted. The conservatism they left behind is but a rotting husk.

            The original neocons were smart and clever. Their analysis of contemporary society and the people we call the left was often compelling, which is why it was easy to overlook their defects. Norman Podhoretz, for example, was an open society proponent who fully embraced the civil right revolution, but he couched it in civic nationalist and liberal sentimentality.https://www.lukeford.net/Images/photos/out.pdfThe second generation were not so smart or clever. They are proof that institutional power and control of the flow of money counts infinitely more than intelligence. Bill Kristol is a legendary screwup. John Podhoretz is a slovenly, bad-tempered simpleton. yet, they persist along with the rest.

                What lightly amuses me are Jews like David  Horowitz who really seems sincere in his transition and is now a man “without a country”.  Scott Miller is the only contemporary I can think of in the vein.

                        Difficult to know for sure. However, I will always respect Horowitz’s willingness to venture into the belly of the beast (academia) and do battle with the campus nutbags on their home turf. Sure, he got paid for those appearances, but it still takes some sand to take the fight to the freaks on hostile ground.

                    Horowitz is “causy.” When he leaves or joins a thing he means it—or hecomes to mean itvia leaving or joining. I don’t know if that’s a Jewish characteristic, but it’s vulgar and desperate in a way I associate with them. My mother was in every political cult of the ’70s.Are any late-in-life reverts to the rightreal? Maybe not. The conversions of “Of course I was a liberal in school, I was a smart kid!” assholes like the Babylon Bee guy, Academic Agent, Vance, [insert your favorite podcast with loud radio ads in it] are always false—not that they always mean to lie, per se, but we all have our natures, “breeding tells,” etc. They don’ttalk right. Teenage libertarianism, for example, always comes back, especially Randianism (as Moldbug/”PayPal mafia” fanboyism, lately). Gen X conservatives still want to grow up to be Alex P. Keaton. Dissidents who came up in “the movement” default in every pinch to mere Reaganism. Trumpisa Clinton-era New Democrat. Etc.“Stop right there. Ifnobody changes, how doeseverybodychange in a way that, for example, sees Trump move from winning friend-to-the-negro awards to being Double Hitler? Staying in place is the abberation.”Right. It’s why they not only hate him but hate him insanely. It’s why they hate normal lower-middle-class white people. Narcissistic injury. Stage hypnotists spot people who “can’t be hypnotized” (don’t play along) and avoid them. The guynot doing the chicken dancehumiliates everyone who does it and ruins the show.How mad are right-wing media guys right now atTHE FUCKING RACIST LOSERSwho have no respect for the men of Trumpism Without Trump? Actual spitting mad—at people who persist in rejecting managerialism after a manager shows up.

                That linked piece is quite a piece of writing.  The mind of the progressive never ceases to amaze me.  He refuses to believe his own (alleged) eyes and the side of his head over James Baldwin and the “psychologists,” who blames all of it on “projection”Though, to be fair, I do think there is projection going on, just not the projection the psychologist believes is happening.  People project themselves on others in the most basic sense.  He believes deep down inside, the other is just like him.  What motivates him or at least could motivate him is what motivates others.  He cannot imagine what would make the “other” behave as they do, so they attribute it to some societal ill or other imagined hidden cause.  But there is no hidden cause other than genetics.  This is the real source of their guilt.  The “problem” is that it cannot be fixed and they know it, they just cannot accept it.

                No question having the smart Jews on the side of conservatism help bring Reagan into office and ten years of renewal and the end of the Soviet Union.  I doubt it could have been done without them.

                    No, it’s not. Jews’ greatest ability isn’t being clever; it’s subversion. It’s why they do best. Once you let them into your organization (or country), they will be at best a never-ending source of trouble and at worst will take over and destroy you and everything your organization (or country) was started to achieve.
Bringing in Jews to win a short-term goal is like making a deal with the devil. It never works out.

                        The collapse of a nation, a government that deeply entrenched in power, is no small matter.  To have occured in Russia, and across eastern Europe, with such rapidity was unnatural and suggests that pressure from the outside played a sizeable role.

                I couldn’t read the Jewish Inside post you linked (paywall) but I wonder if it mentioned why Irving Kristol abandoned Trostkyism as a young adult.
It was because he was drafted into the Army during WW2 and went through basic with a position where half the guys were from Cicero, Illinois. As Kristol later recalled “it was then when I realized that the worker’s paradise was not going to come into bring with the human capital which actually existed.”

            After the Soviet collapse, the neocons shifted to another enemy, Islam, which the conservative movement went along with, which led to war, and eventually the Patriot Act, and here we are, with white patriotic Americans now seen as an enemy.
Those paleocons like Buchanan, Sam Francis, Joe Sobran, et al were correct by warning that there was nothing to stop the regime from using the Patriot Act on US citizens.
It turns out that the neocons, all along, have had three major enemies: Russia, Islam and White people.

                So will you be able to see Islam as a threat before your dhimmitude? At some point, shouldn’t one take their “Death to the Infidel!” riots seriously? Maybe after they finish shooting up a community center or 20, or setting off bombs at marathon finish lines, or driving trucks through crowds, or going on machete slashing sprees?
There’s no harm in saying neocons got that one right, but that that does not make them allies.

                That was Stephen Tonsor a prof at the university of michigan. He gave that speech in 1986 in Chicago and it was published in National Review later. I was there when he gave that speech to the Philly Society at the Drake Hotel. In 1988 Russell Kirk gave a speech at the Heritage foundation where he statedd that many neocons mistake Tel Aviv for the capital of the USA.  These paleo versus neon wars would restult in the Pat Buchanan runs for president after which the paleos faded until Paul Gottfried’s call for an alternative right.  I would add that the Neocons were not really big backers of Reagan in 1980.  They moved in after he won.

                    I was an EE major but bonded with Tonsor as my spiritual mentor at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Long story how we were introduced. I was eating lunch at his house when he would write, for better or for worse, under the influence. A truly good man.

        “Of course, this raises the oldest critique of America’s two-party political system, that it is just a show put on for the masses. The real decisions are made outside of public view by the powerful interests who control the system.” That, of course, is the purpose of party systems and “democracy”. They channel public dissatisfaction away from fundamental change. I remember in my naive younger days my great joy when Reagan was elected and then my realization years later that his presidency didn’t really change anything; it was as if it never happened.

                There are two TDS syndromes: the leftist one where Trump is the new Hitler and the rightist version that Trump is the new savior (my Christian Zionist family members favor this one). The best we can hope for from Trump is that he staves off the deluge a little longer.

                    Neither my husband nor I plan to vote.  We don’t hate Trump – and we both voted for him in 2016.  But we’re done with politics.  My husband believes that a Trump win (which neither of us believe will happen/be allowed) would benefit our family short term (financial and security) so we would prefer to see a Trump presidency.  But we no longer have any faith or hope in the system or faux-nation of AINO.

                Rather than “nothing changed”, I think it’s more fair to say none of his changes had much staying power. While the “two regulations repealed for every one added” had that effect, the Deep State kept the text of those repealed regulations in their desk drawers to re-implement as soon as Biden was sworn in.

                        GOP opposition to Obamacare (as with so many social issues) was  all about flogging the issue to solicit donations and energize the vote.  Utterly cynical–and totally useless in terms of serving their voters’ interests.
Mitch McConnell, Liz Cheney, and George Will wouldbe revolted if the party actually did anything to benefit the average white person.

                The “Reagan Revolution” was really just the advent of the financialization that comes at the end of empire, and in the fullness of time, nothing more. In the long run, we’d have been just as well off skipping it. Maybe better off, as perhaps it would have retarded the GR if it hadn’t happened. But in the short run, I guess all the fake prosperity was nice and I shouldn’t complain too much about it, as a person could grow up under worse circumstances.

        If Netanyahoo is stupid enough to throw the kitchen sink at Iran, I expect them to counter launch wave-after-wave of hypersonic ballistic missiles and destroy Israel’s power and water supply systems. The exodus that will follow will be the death knell of Zionism in the Middle East and the world will cheer. And if the US is stupid enough to step in, Russia will prove how impotent our military has become. Our decline is accelerating. We have to hit bottom before we can rebound.

            I expect them to counter launch wave-after-wave of hypersonic ballistic missiles and destroy Israel’s power and water supply systems.“Press X to doubt…”I think this would be great but it is quite unrealistic. The Persians have responded rather toothlessly thus far toinsaneaggression from da Joos! Including killing someone on Iranian soil, killing people -on the grounds of foreign embassies-, etc.Imagine for a minuteanyother country on Earth doing these things to the US, as an example. Pretend a foreign head of state was killed in NYC, a NATO ally country’s embassy was attacked to kill a diplomat friendly to the US. Whether these actions were by Russia, North Korea, whoever.What would be happening as a response? It would be highly kinetic I can tell you that. No, the Iranians talk a big game but I don’t see them taking the gloves off even after larger strikes because the reality is that they would have done something by now if they were going to.

                Part of me agrees with you.  The other part thinks that Iran is not as bloodthirsty, evil, reckless (pick your adjective) as the US and its ZOG overlords.  So it will react the way it reacts, not the way the ZOG would or thinks Iran should/would.

            I have a somewhat darker take on the delayed Israeli response to Iran.Based on the information that has surfaced, I think the Israelis and the US have realized they don’t have nearly the conventional offensive and defensive military power they thought they did. This is the reality that the LTC/Colonel level officers have passed up the chain of command.Due to this potential reality, the more extreme elements in Israel are trying to convince their countrymen and extreme elements in the US to go nuclear on Iran.Obviously, I hope my conjecture is incorrect, but this is what the bits of information that recently came out indicate to me.

        Excellent article, Z.  I was a plank subscriber to the then new American Conservative mag in 2002, as I was big fan of Buchanan and stayed a subscriber well into the Obama years until PJB was essentially purged from his own magazine.  I clearly remember the famous cover from early 2003 during the run up to the Iraq war titled “Whose War?”  His article pulled no punches as to ((who)) was behind this war. Of course, the neocons and even most normie cons went apesh**.  Ron Paul was another almost lone voice in the GOP anti-war wilderness back then.  In 2008 Paul was the last guy I voted for POTUS until Trump in 2016.  None since and certainly no one is on the horizon, not that voting matters anymore.

            As a result of the American Conservative stance, along with Chronicles and a few others, such as Ron Paul’s crowd, National Review ran the cover story by neocon and Bush speechwriter David Frum titled “Unpatriotic Conservatives.”

                Frum’s essay was in March 2003 in the National Hebrew (Review) and was of course full of lies. What is interesting is that Bill Buckley was alive and well at the time but David Frum was in charge at National Hebrew.  And Now Frum is an open leftist at the Atlantic and the importance of National Hebrew Review has disappeared… gone with the wind.

        One of Trump’s chief failings, in my point of view, is that he is so strongly and reflexively pro-Israel. Far more than Harris. But he’d be pro-Israel on his own terms, promoting peace. What Kristol really means, but is not quite saying, is that Trump is a threat to the neocons, whereas Harris is a compliant puppet.

        That article is really revealing.  Not a word about anything these supposed “conservatives” were supposed to believe in.  The fiscal health of the country, our national interests and debt, freedom…
And the total assumption that war with Russia and Iran are positive outcomes.  (If we even processed the power to win such those wars).  No mention of their track record from Vietnam through Afghanistan.

        Without a trace of irony, they accuse Trump fans of disloyalty for not supporting the Ukraine war or the Israel wars.In my case that is a double edged sword. When the term neocon started kicking around I had no idea what it meant. The closest thing to a dissident in my circle were cuck conservatives and neocons. They had no idea what the word meant either.Like them I was all in on the sand box wars, 100% behind (((Our Greatest Allies And Friends))). I liked some of the noise coming out of the NRx and Alt Right – but was put off by fags and clowns like Milo and Vox Day.Then I stumbled across this place and slowly began to learn. Now I’m sitting on this pile of information and don’t know what to do with it. The jews are a murderous pack of rat faced liars taken as a group.All this noticing and the failure of neoliberalism and neoconservatism is fine… but what are we going to DO…? If this keeps up we are going to have to start killing people or they will kill us…

        Former Bush aides make a conservative Jewish case for Kamala Harris (archive.is)Archived link if you don’t wish to have to enter your email to read the article as it required me to.As AINO becomes more tribal, the members of the various tribes become more open about their interests and about who they represent. The latter a product of the former, it’s not that they are becoming more honest per se, it’s that the increasingly contentious nature of the tribal competition requires it. Because in this environment, all the tribes justifiably feel threatened. Desperate people do desperate things, such as tell the truth. If we had very many people willing to fight this would be dangerous, but since we don’t, you can follow this burgeoning trend to its logical conclusion and understand why I feel optimistic about relatively peaceful secession becoming a reality sooner or later. Certainly no tribe will be large or strong enough to dominate AINO in its entirety by force. For now, through rigged elections and a functional money printer, the regime is able to both maintain control and keep everyone somewhat placated, but nothing lasts forever.

        What the alien overclass has to fear is what happens when the people calling themselves Democrats who genuinely did oppose all those wars drop out of the system. The alien over-class system relies on a thin patina of legitimacy afforded by partially-fraudulent elections.The vote isn’t rigged everywhere in the same way. Ballot box stuffing happens in the close districts, but other forms of fraud and rigging happen in safe districts. See also: Mayor Adam’s in NYC, “indicted” for impure thoughts about illegals. Rigging takes on many flavors. Trump had fun at the Al Smith Dinner skewering the uniparty over that indictment. It can now be spoken of OUT LOUD, and that is a big step forward.But most rigging is underpinned by legitimate voter participation. What happens when 60-70% of the country flips and drops out? I don’t know that anyone has an answer to a government that loses popular legitimacy. The usual path is legitimacy by shotgun…hence the FBI’s recent evolution from a quiet Gestapo to a very public one.While sad to be left with only “We told you so” victories, there is in those victories a nugget of future success: these people are no longer affiliated with us. The purge is working, and we need to accelerate it.Trump could accelerate this even faster with one simple salvo of political ads and messaging: we are now in three wars on our way to five wars in 4 years.Instead of running ads about trannies he should be running ads about the three new neocon wars, and asking the legitimately anti-war Democrats just how many more wars are they going to tolerate and choke down in the name of party unity?  The message?  “We are purging these people from our party.  Unfortunately, they have set up camp in yours.  The only way for you to purge them is to either vote for me or stay home and don’t vote.  If you want an end to endless wars, you have to purge them.  I know that sucks, but your principle are worth it.”It’s irrelevant how they vote. What he needs to do is accelerate the split and undermine the alien class’ veneer of popular legitimacy.

        I often wonder what would’ve happened if McCain or Clinton would’ve won instead of Obama, not too many remember that Bush was pushing for Ukraine to join NATO at the end of his presidency. His admin successfully got a puppet regime installed in Georgia which caused the same exact thing that happened with Ukraine minus the infinite military support so Russia quickly decimated them. Had a typical neocon gotten into office the Ukraine timeline would’ve happened a lot sooner.I’m not sure if they only did a coup instead of pushing for NATO membership because Obama was still in his “Russian reset” phase or if they learned from the Russo-Georgian War that there needed to be a lot more prep. Either way Obama &amp; then especially Trump certainly delayed the time line of their plans. Their idiotic &amp; rapid destruction of the country in response to the latter winning made kicking off aggression towards Russia an existential goal for the empire’s survival.Well never know for sure what what would’ve happened but its probably for the best that this got delayed, the empire was much more militarily formidable back in the aughts compared to now. That’s no doubt a big reason why the neocons were constantly foaming at the mouth about Obama during his first term.

McCain is a given. He never saw a scrap he wanted America to sit out. Heck, yes, he’d have been all over Ukraine. Don’t know if he could have gotten the job done, either. First thing he’d have done is amp up Affy and Iraq and burn through all materiel we had on hand. Then maybe attack Syria. Or France. Or some other vital American interest…

Now that I think about it pretty much everyone in the neocon wing was still fully committed to the ME at that time while the Russian angle was still sort of a side project. On that same note of forgetfulness, Romney with his, at the time, strange obsession with Russia on the campaign trail completely slipped my mind.I was remembering just a little sliver there without the wider context so you’re definitely right. If not for Obama slowing things down they would’ve certainly continued stampeding down that path.

            What’s terrifying about the 1990s is that the push to hem in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union with NATO countriesseemed like a good idea at the time, That Russian policy – let alone Soviet policy – had long been to maintain buffer states along its western border with mainland Europe, struck us Francis Fukuyama kool-aid drinkers as retrograde. We were like, dude, you guys can drink coke, eat at McDonalds, see Elton John in concert… You’ve thrown off your chains and you can be like us!That Russians didn’t want to be like us, never occurred to anyone. That Russia has legitimate national interests of its own, that do not coincide with the interests of western pirate companies, politicians, and entrepreneurs, does not compute in the minds of our deracinated masters.

It was ridiculous before but at least back then they could at least argue the system was prosperous but now the ugly face of neoliberalism is on full display for the world to see.I have to bring up China, such an obvious example, they played their hand perfectly getting all the benefits of our elites destroying the West while simultaneously refusing to imbibe the destructive ideology. It seems like an obvious strategy for them to employ on it face but then again its really easy to be detached from reality when you never have to face consequences for it. That’s obviously not going to last though &amp; as per usual people like you &amp; me are going to pay the highest price for these chickens coming home to roost.

        “Long forgotten is the fact that the label “neoconservative” was a smear coined by a socialist named Michael Harrington.”Not relevant to the thrust of your post but Harrington came out with a book titled “The Other America” back in 1961 (I think). He explained how a sizable chunk of Americans — in the richest country in the world — was living in squalor. It had quite an impact in the country and was probably one of the impulses behind Johnson’s “Great Society” program a few years later. The Democrats of the last thirty years have nothing to do with any of this and the party has become a place where “progressive movements go to die.” Lance Selfa’s book on the party explains what sellouts they really are. The kind of party where Clinton, Obama, and Biden feel perfectly at home.

        The libertarians are rightly criticized and mocked. However, the LewRockwell/RonPaul crowd that is paleocon adjacent rightly, accurately and completely criticized them. I suspect this is why so many come over to the Traditionalist side of the divide because of that priming. They did serve a useful purpose.
As for the label, at some point before they were Trotskyites were they Muranos? I am willing to bet that is the case with Mayorkas.

            I have defended Ron Paul on here many times (though, frankly, he doesn’t need it – you never really hear him badmouthed here). He allowed me, as a young man in high school, to step back and recognize that the two parties are the same. When he questioned the Civil Rights revolution, I understood just how limited the discourse is, and just how much of the existing structure is a “given.” Much like the paleocons, Paul allowed me to see just how restricted the traditional system is.

                Yes. It is interesting to watch videos of RP from the 80s and early 90s. He was at the height of his powers and his fire burned its brightest. He was always racially aware. You can see that aside from the ideological battle he provides the subtext that there is also a tribal/ethnic component that is just nature at work.He softened later on and became a one issue person investing everything in End The Fed. I suspect he thought the money printer reliance was weak and going to falter and went after it. Looks like its lifespan while not eternal has a lot more legs. It was the right thing to do, since it is the great enabler of the rest of the project.I ramble. Yes. RP was a great American and he probably did as much or more for the emergent Traditionalist American or Heritage American cause to get us to this point as anything. Now the biggest recruiter is The Regime itself. It is unmasked and RP is no longer necessary as a bridging catalyst.

                I didn’t know he questioned the Civil Right revolution; yet, when shoehorned into a black district in Texas, he fixed the roads, dropped the crime, kept the streetlights on and the water running.  He was a public servant, who served his constituents faithfully instead of poking his snout in the trough.  That tells you the kind of man he was, and why they kept re-electing him.

                        Opposition to discrimination “law” in private businesses is not the same as opposing “civil rights”. Ron Paul was and is a huge proponent of property rights, but that government should be neutral.

            I found this interesting article using the search term “marranos” via DuckDuckGo:https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/marrano-diasporait supplies a history (one-sided, but to be expected in consideration of the source) of the Marranos and their spread, activities in their diaspora, and impact. It is worthy of a read, but there are other articles that can also be found that may supply parallax views and information, also.I have heard it voiced that LBJ came from a Marrano background. His actions surrounding the attack on the USS Liberty might be better understood with this possibility in mind (beyond the compelling danger of alienating the jewish community as a power center in US politics).Given the widespread diaspora of Marranos, Mayorkas could certainly have emerged from their ranks through his family’s Cuban origins. Working for HIAS as he did makes it clear that he had an axe to grind.

                That’s why I keep insisting the majority of the tribes of Israel leaned Aryan; the implacable percentage were Marranos then, just as they are Marranos now. Their race is their religion, as with any black or Indian.
Mayorkas, like Castro and Castro’s bastard son, is of Sephardi descent.Communism (and Feminism) is evangelical Judaism, as was Islam, thus the Red-Green ummah (supertribe).
The problem for us this moment is that Biden was the trojan horse to bring in a hard Communist, Kamala, to complete Obama’s Revolution under Emhoff’s handling. She was made border Czar along with Mayorkas for a reason.

Thus, the fat tail’s push towards messianism, universalism (globalism), and monotheism.

        I think yourself and most of the commenters here are wrong, missing the “revolution in political fundraising affairs” that Obama created in 2009. [to borrow from Rumsfeld].It was not just the money and amount from Iran that came in, but who it went to: the rising non-White elite in the Party, bureaucracies, NGOs, and so on that form the power basis for the Party. It was an even bigger revolution than the Clinton’s China grift (who can forget the immortal poetry of Al Gore’s “no controlling legal authority” over the Buddhist Temple millions of donations).Thus the Democratic Party up to Oct 7 2023 was balanced between the Obama ascendancy being pro-Iran and raking in the money from Iran, and the legacy pro-Zionist Jewish lobby. Who is more powerful and ascendant, the 78 year old Schumer or the under 40 AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Pramilla Jayapal? The latter are the future of the party and have a near unlimited amount of Iranian funds coming to them.Israel just arrested seven members of an Iranian Spy ring operating in Israel providing Iran targeting information, for money and also it would seem anti-Zionist ideology (provided detailed targeting instructions to Israeli military bases and installations per arrest documents). The Biden Admin has leaked the assessed (by the US) Israeli attack plan, certainly by the pro-Iran faction that is dominant (Obama in his third term).Meanwhile people like Bill Ackman, Jaime Dimon, Ray Dalio, etc. are crossing over to the Republican Party; while the neo-cons (some not Jewish like Cheney, Bolton, etc) are crossing to the Democrats.Neo-cons dream of “restoration” as per your accurate comment, their Trotskyite ancestors were purged and fled, ruling Russia. They find alliance with Dems dreaming of making Russia 100% gay and trans, and filled with extra vibrancy.The issue of Iran is thus both a unifier and splitter. Unifier in that it gives the anti-White faction of Dems unlimited money, and has allowed for them to chase Jews out of the Ivies (Bill Ackman knows that today’s activists who chased his kids out of Harvard are tomorrow’s SEC enforcers seizing his company, so to speak). This unifies the Dems. However the neo-cons hate hate hate Russia, and with a defacto alliance with Iran, they will seek to hit Iran as well. Because Russia, not Israel. [If they cared about Israel more than they hated Russia, they’d have stayed Republican].Thus Republicans are more unified. Opposed to Iran, supportive of Israel (both within limits), and with significant elements of the military industrial complex aligned with retrench/reform. The neo-cons leaving removes the fractures inherent in forever wars against perceived Russian proxies or Russia itself.Democrats are now trying to square the circle, retaining legacy Jewish support while being Pro-Iran, and keeping the neo-cons onboard with that by promising ever greater Russia escalation sure to provoke elements of the military into shutting things down.A side effect is Jewish organization and intellect into Democratic Campaigns is being replaced by vibrant and diverse up and comers who are both anti- and non- White. With the results you’d expect. Trump goes to McDonalds and Harris responds with Walz jazz hands.

        In the fullness of time 9/11 will be seen as the US entry into WW2.   The regime wanted it and did what they needed to get it.    Goad an enemy, cross their red lines and box them in, then ignore obvious warnings of a ‘surprise’ attack, propagandize and profit.   10/7 will likely be the same.

        Vladimir Putin was also vindicated. One time he is said to have said that at its base level the Soviet Union operated no differently than the United States operates. They had a one-party state, we have a uniparty. Elections mean nothing.
It doesn’t get more Republican than the Taft family and yesterday former Ohio governor Bob Taft endorsed the Democrat incumbent Sherrod Brown in the election. So much for Ronald Reagan’s 11th commandment. (I also found it funny that this news blurb came across on Channel 6 here which was once controlled by the Taft family.)
Uniparty sticks together.

Not, of course, mutually exclusive.

            And you can throw in Trotsky for the trifecta. No mystery, it’s all three.The proof is just two words: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. For the founders of neoconservatism he was revered. After Ivan Denisovitch and especially Gulag Archipelago he was made word famous by the anti communist establishment and conservatives, paleo and neo alike, but especially neo. A brilliant writer. Noble Prize for Literature 1970, for once well deserved. Brutal critic of Stalinism.But – did not emigrate. Was unwillingly expelled in 1974, stripped of his citizenship and flown to West Germany.  Lived in seclusion in remote Vermont.Thereafter? Utterly unpersoned in the West. His once canonical books now ignored if not suppressed. Cancelled before the internet was even a gleam in DARPA’s eye.Everyone knows why. It turned out that he really loved Russia. He just hated the Bolsheviks, and he knew who they were.Happy ending however. He left the West in disgust and returned to Russia in 1994 to great acclaim. Was elected to the Russian Academy of Arts and Sciences and won the Russia State Prize. Wrote extensively on many subjects until his death in Moscow in 2008. Nobody in the West heard anything about that unless they searched it out.I am absolutely certain that no new translations of any of his later works will ever be allowed to appear in any Anglo-European language in my lifetime except (oh the irony) in Samizdat form (as some of them do already). The usual suspects will see to that.Side note – it’s situations like this that make my blood boil at the “banned books” hypocrites. Let’s see them bring out ” Two Hundred Years Together”, put it on Kindle and flood the libraries and bookstores with it. Then we can talk.

        I like Jim kunstler’s writing, but, you know, I can’t be a true blue believer because….  It’s like Candace Owens, when the rubber meets the road, or real push comes to shove, are they going to team up with side jew and black?  Most likely so.  They’re not my people.
On another note, Unz has a complimentary article today.

        The political Left has always harbored strange bedfellows. Certain men of a bullying nature have found their way to the left of the aisle. In Russia, there was Joseph Stalin. In America, there was Lyndon Johnson. These men ruled with an iron fist while mouthing soft-hearted platitudes.They came to the Left because it gave them a vehicle to achieve power. Johnson used to give opponents the “Johnson Treatment” where he would loom over them, dominating their personal space. Stalin was Stalin — paranoid, insecure, prone to shifty-eyed suspicion of associates and the commitment of them to the Cause. They believed — they fooled themselves — because life is just easier when an act becomes real.The true liberal is a soft-eyed doe like Jimmy Carter — classic — or Mr. Hope ‘n Change himself, the willowy Barack Obama. These men would sooner cry themselves to sleep than get in a fistfight on the street.Gradually, the Johnsons and Stalins have been purged from the Democratic party. If that is whom the neocons resemble most, they will find it uncomfortable living under the Big Tent of the Left.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            In that light, then, the Trot wolves have scented a new flock of sheep- a flock of catamites, women, and nonwhites eager for spoils.
