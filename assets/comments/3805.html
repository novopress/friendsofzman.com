        Yep.  The threat of impeachment is far more frightening than the reality.  Obama really does think he was elected king.  Why shouldn’t he?

        We have a saying in the UK that when the US catches a cold, we sneeze. What is happening in the States is sure to happen here sooner or later. Oh, sure, there are occasional hiccups in the smooth running of a ‘democracy’ like the recent kerfuffle over long-standing MPs Jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind being in trouble regarding a ‘cash for questions’ scandal (you pay me, I ask a loaded question aimed at the right minister on your behalf in the Commons) but the penalties are ineffective because such antics keep re-appearing. There is an ongoing dismay over MPs expenses here (highlighted when one MP put in expenses for the purchase of a chocolate bar) but they still keep doing it.Parliament here is a gravy train that never runs dry. No wonder people are so eager to be elected to ‘serve the people’ when money and chocolate is so easily available.If the likes of Cameron or whoever Labour can dredge up courtesy of the Union block vote or even the feeble Clegg hear of what the Clintons are doing I imagine they will try it too at some point. After all, who’s going to say anything? The lefty press? Al-Beeb? They will fear far more the EU dictators than the British public.

            We have the same things here. Congress is exempt from insider trader laws. So, they get to cash in on their legislation by having their financial managers direct their money and their family’s money into investments that will prosper from pending legislation. Of course, those seeking to buy favors will pass along information, rather than cash, as that would be bribery.Harry Reid, the man formerly head of the Senate, has never had a job in the private sector. He has cashed a government check his whole life. He was born into extreme poverty. He has a net worth of $6.8 million.As to where it starts. on this side we tend to think the crackpot ideas start in Europe and come our way. But, the only thing we are good at exporting is culture so I’m sure we give you guys plenty of crackpot ideas along with it. We gave the Nazis eugenics, for example.

        The elites still rely on the legislative process to get money and disburse it.  They are still investing enormous amounts in harvesting votes, both through subsidies and campaign spending.  Once they figure a way to game or bypass the legislatively regulated revenue gathering and distribution system, the game shifts along the Clausewitzian spectrum from non-violent to violent politics.  Google Tax anyone?

            They rely on the old customs as a legitimizing act. Congress has not had a serious budget debate in ten years, maybe longer. They simply increase everything by 7% and add on whatever goodies they need to keep their patronage operations going.
But, Team Obama is hard at work to get around this. They are casting about for some ways to “close loopholes” in the tax code without having to go to Congress.http://tinyurl.com/o6ko543

                The magic 7%.  I still remember back in 95-96 when the huge battle between the Repubs and Dems was going on over Medicare.  When all of the “the republicans are cutting Medicare and killing grandpa” BS was stripped away, it turned out the the debate was really over whether to increase spending 7% or 10% per year.  Put in language that intelligent people would understand, whether to double spending every eleven years or every seven and a half years.  The political debate was like a debate between morons and imbeciles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moron_%28psychology%29).  What’s amazing is that the bankers and fixers have been able to keep it going for this long.  The canny few who get all of this have all asked me some variant on “when does someone reach for the reset button?”  in other words, when does someone or some group decide that the risk of abolishing the present order is less than the cost of continuing on with it.  My gut tells me that would be around the time that three or four doubling cycles have passed (absolutely nothing historical or in economics to support this… I just figure that when you approach 16x, even imbeciles start to catch on).  If 1995 is our start time, then sometime between 2025 and 2035.

        The clintons are merely the stain left on the under ware of the American political system.  Hope for our once great country is dwindling rapidly.  Consider a ruling class that will not enforce our borders and redistributes the hard earned income of it diminishing working class to illegals in the form of free education, anchor babies, welfare, food stamps and the list  goes on and on.  Consider a  ruling class that does not think it is important to have voter ID to cast a ballot in our elections. Consider a ruling class that flaunts the Constitution at every opportunity, conducts the nations business in secrecy, rails against racism to a white country that elected a “black” man president.  Universities, courtrooms denying the flag, the military paying for sex change operations for traitors in uniform,  homosexual marriage,  a treasury secretary that doesn’t pay taxes, and attorney general who only represents his “own people”,  a press that is so in the tank for the ruling party that true journalism is all but dead,  an education system crumbling due to pie-in-the sky programs intended to make up for the fact that blacks cannot and will not behave and learn , a president who releases foreign combatants so they may rejoin the battle against America, is all hope lost? — sorry, rant off.
