        Very insightful. This is exactly it. It is a checklist of slights. It is indicative of a fragile, narcissistic psyche. It is also indicative of someone trying to win an argument, not actually accomplish anything. Obama is a playing a game, and it’s Eric Berne’s I Got You Now You Son of a Bitch.I felt after the Reagan years that pretty much any honest person would have left the Democratic Party. All the smart people said how awful he was, and he was both very popular and events proved him correct. That was the insult they couldn’t tolerate, and never have been able to tolerate. Those who remained liberal have spent 25 years rewriting history. The rest of us moved right.To liberals, governing (or ruling) is a birthright. They are the smart people. They know what they are doing. Conservatives need to get out of the way. If conservatives are proven correct, too, that just can’t be.Part of the problem was the Great Society not only didn’t work, it destroyed communities. The liberals blinked during the Cold War, with Carter ridiculing “the inordinate fear of communism.” Jimmy Carter was supposed to be a brilliant president. He was a failure.So you rewrite history.

        That’s a very good insight. I posted on Belmont Club a couple of years ago that the administration’s executive orders web page was almost empty.  It either had not been updated in months or all of the exec orders the admin was always threatening to issue were simply not being signed. Another data point in support of your hypothesis. The page now seems to be up to date.

        I have not seen this interpretation of Obama’s actions before.  Intriguing.  Basically a focus on Reagan and an attempt to obliterate every facet and achievement of Reagan’s tenure as President.  It actually fits with the various elements of Obama’s policies, and meshes with the Progressives’ opinion that Reagan is the embodiment of all evil in this country.Note that Obama, early on, singled out the “transformational” element of Reagan’s presidency as something to be noted.  Reagan was ultimately the champion of white, suburban, middle class, married-with-children America.  He helped reestablish an economy that would provide many good middle class jobs, and he reinvigorated the U.S. Military.  He demonstrated a skill at taking provocative and aggressive international negotiating positions to beat down our enemies and lift up our allies.Now turn each of Reagan’s accomplishments on its head.  Beat down white, middle class, suburban, traditional families with a wife, a husband, and children. Destroy middle class jobs with international trade treaties and unfettered illegal immigration.  Spit on the military, reward our enemies, and insult our allies.It goes on and on.  Reagan indirectly lifted up the idea of a Christian-based nation.  Obama lifts up Islam and basically pisses all over our Judeo-Christian culture every chance he gets.  I could go on and on with examples.It is assumed these days, that Obama has some sort of psychological tic that explains why he acts in the ways he does.  After all these years, you, Zman, have hit on the thing that actually makes sense of all the specific actions this man takes, large and small, and places them in a context that makes them both understandable and predictable, and in a specific sort of way rather than a general one.

            It’s a simple explanation that accounts for so much, but, for most, it’s difficult to come to grips with the idea that someone that powerful can be so petty.

                I think this explanation of Obama’s motives and actions is brilliant; it explains why we see the lightning but never hear the thunder.I live on the North Shore of metropolitan Chicago and frequently do business in the city. It’s one big can of progressive concentrate. The lib-lefties I meet with behave exactly the same way as Obama when it comes to politics; after the victory parade you get high and forget about it. No follow up, no interest in examining the results.Zman, you are a very perceptive individual. The left is a state of mind, and that’s all. Because that’s all that matters to them. It’s about them. Everything is just all about them.I agree with the previous poster; it is hard to believe that their motives are so small, so squalid. But they are. Believe me.

        I would think Obama believes that history will look at his “achievements” while he is office and praise him for doing so much in the face of such terrible opposition. Naturally, it goes without saying the present media circus will praise him whatever he does, and so perhaps he thinks that the leader writers of the major ‘newspapers’ and media commentators are destined to be historians. I mean, no historian has even done anything but look at old pages of newspapers. right?Or of course, he doesn’t care about anything but having good time with destroying as much as he can while he can. Who cares about the future when only now matters?

            Obama reminds me of South Asians I’ve met. Indian tend to be sequential thinkers and very narrow. Give them step by step driving instructions and they will follow them to the letter, even if they drive off a cliff. There’s an inability to see the bigger picture at work that is inscrutable to the Western mind.That’s what I see with Obama. getting a deal with Iran is on his list. The deal itself and what it means in a broader context is of no interest. He is just focused on ticking the item off the list. That’s why he reacted as he did when a reporter pointed out that he left four Americans rotting in a Persian jail. That was probably the first time he even noticed it.Obama is our first foreign ruler. Therefore he has little respect for American customs and traditions. At some level I do think he holds those things in contempt.

            “…no historian has even done anything but look at old pages of newspapers. right?” In recent years, a couple of them who are on TV a lot have lifted others’ recounts of history and called it their own. And they’re still on TV a lot.
