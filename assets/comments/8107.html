        Just an outsider’s observation of the American work ethic with regards to women in the work place – one of the reasons I believe American women are in the work place is because the American society is so consumer driven. You can’t have that big house, a SUV, a big screen TV, a boat, and two jet-skis in the garage without that second income. Something about keeping up with the Jones’.I think if Americans were just a bit more modest, they could live on a single income just like they did in the 50’s and early 60’s. Yes, I know…housing prices are much higher in some areas. But my years in Silicon Valley was a real eye-opener and the standing joke was that Americans “Are people who buy things with money they don’t have, to own things they don’t need, to impress people they don’t know.” Even in this blog a few comments were directed to me that Europeans are “poor” compared to Americans because we have a lower median income, live in old houses, don’t go out to eat very often and don’t have much “stuff”.Sorry, but I had to laugh at that one. Especially when I think about all the American garages and storage units full of “stuff”. The average American debt on credit cards is $15k, auto loans $27k, student loans $48k. Living a lifestyle based on debt is no way to live, and certainly not something to teach our children.In the 1950’s one in three American women were in the workplace, now, it’s around three in five. In Europe, the number of working women is lower than in the US, (not counting single mothers), and probably closer to 1960’s levels. But Europeans (especially Germans) typically live more modest lifestyles, avoid debt and are not willing to work a second job just to have a leased BMW 7-series in the driveway.The argument of “women are under represented in the workforce” is based on the premise they should be there in the first place. I would argue living a more modest lifestyle, saving your money and raising your children is ultimately better for society than an indebted family with a working mother who leaves her children to be raised in a daycare.

                $300 in 2016 = $25 in 1955.  Or,  just see how many 1950’s silver, half-dollars your $300 will buy today.Just keeping it apples to apples.

        “…..the men in charge of the company decided to pack the HR departments with women ……”
About the time you were undergoing re-education, I was working for a defense contractor.  Heavy on the engineering and technical science.
How else are you going to pad your employment stats?  TPTB looks at you with furrowed brow if 75% of your staff is from the Pale Penis People tribe, and another 15-20% or so is Indian and East Asian male.
You start with HR, then move of to marketing and then finance and accounting.  After that you’re out of bullets.

        I’ve always called HR “down the hall and around the corner”.  A staff position no one in their right mind wants unless he/she is a power hungry little tyrant who loves OSHA and codes and diversity and AA and keeping the doers smacked down and in their place.I was headed through the glass ceiling before the women’s libbers got their seatbelts fastened, so they have always annoyed me.  As have office girl types who dress like hookers and flirt outrageously, then cry “harrassment” at the drop of an innuendo.   I worked because I had to support my children and flipping hamburgers was not an option.  An attractive woman, I dressed appropriately for business – even on Casual Friday – and I acted like a professional.  A problem solver, a good no-nonsense manager, I moved up, hampered only by those of both sexes (we only had two then)  who were weak achievers and really put off by anyone with a brain who worked smart.  The one old goat VP who tried to come on to me was dismissed by me and never approached me again.  I did not report him to anyone.Offered HR at one time, I turned it down – for reasons that should be obvious.Like another commenter, I’m not big on broad brush misogyny.Ailes set up his Fox brand with the kind of women who were bound to turn on him at some point.  He has groomed and dressed them to look a certain way.  And he looks very much like the kind of really unattractive guy who has only power to offer – so he gives it a try.  It was only a matter of time.

            I’ll agree with you and Saml Adams.  HR, along with Compliance and Legal, are domains of the politically correct / non-productive staffers.  I try to avoid at all costs as they will actively block my projects if I draw their attention.

        “We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: ‘I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.’”That’s the quote that concludes the first chapter of the 1963 book that launched the war on the American family – The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. I was just finishing up high school. But I missed the memo that women should want more. I knew what I wanted – a husband, kids and a home.Raising my kids in the seventies and eighties, I did triple duty filling in for the women who were ‘finding‘ themselves by filing papers and answering the phone for someone else. I volunteered at the school and Cub Scouts and Camp Fire Girls where there were precious few SAHMs to organize the fund-raisers and the character building activities so I did it, along with the handful of others who attended a dozen meetings a month.I clearly did not get paid with money but my recompense was definitely legal tender. Over time I became so good at volunteerism I was often asked to present to new potential volunteer recruits for different children’s groups and charities. I always concluded by spiel by saying, “There is no greater reward than hearing your grown children reminisce about the time we did this or that. I just didn’t want to ever hear about the time Mrs. so-n-so did this or that with my kids who will always remember it was ME. And all those kids who were in my care and teaching remember too.”A tall good looking young man came up to me in a mall once. He said, “Hey! Remember me? Jason – Cub Scouts?” He remembered me in the best of ways – great memories of mentoring.Therefore my legacy has nothing to do with money or material things or credentials.By making my own choice, without influence of books and articles in women’s mags, I found myself and my worth very well and who I am is about as valuable as it gets in the real world. I ignored the naysayers who argued that I ought to ‘DO something” with my life and talents and I just did it anyway.The irony is all the experience I earned in the SAHM years qualified me for even better things as my kids grew up and launched. Among other things I have owned three businesses.Time is the great equalizer and the worm turns. I see signs that more and more young women are finally deciding that staying home with the kids is, in fact, a real job and one of the most challenging, skill-testing positions of authority ever created.This topic gets me steaming.http://bagsallpacked.blogspot.com/2016/06/faith-does.html

                Thank you, sir! I am indeed blessed.
And just a note to vent that I am so sick and tired of the movies and tv shows starring skinny female bad a$$ detectives who can wrestle down a tattooed thug with one hand while sweeping their long golden locks off their face and whipping out the cuffs.
I am a strong woman because I know what that really means and who believes that men are meant to be the stronger gender physically.. Feminism has destroyed the natural balance. Tired tired tired of men being feminized. Tired I say!/rant

        “That made no difference. I was told I had to write him up, which I refused to do. That got me in some trouble and forever on the HR hit list, but it was the shape of things to come. My policy was going to be zero tolerance for this sort of terrorism.”
And if there were more men like you we wouldn’t be in this mess now.  Every male nowadays cave-in to every form of leftist intellectual (and physical) terrorism imaginable.  So we get more of it.
There is nothing to be gained by cooperating with HR.

        My husband was hiring and had a woman interview for the position. She mentioned that she’d filed a sexual harassment suit against her previous employer. He didn’t say anything to her, but threw away her resume afterwards.
I don’t know how we change things but yes, I’m in favor of fewer women in the work place.

            I’m in favor of fewer women in the workplace so women can go back to being women. Almost all women like being mothers, staying at home raising their kids. But, the people in charge have other ideas.

                Being a stay-at-home (SAHM) mother is difficult but would be less so if there were more SAHMs.  Nowadays, hardly any women SAHM so the ones who do are forced to distract their kids all day while the rest of the neighborhood kids – if any – are at daycare.  Our society is in its death throes as mothering and child rearing is a lost art only Latin American nannies understand.That said, SAHMs at least have something to show for all of the extreme difficulty of mothering.  Working women have higher taxes and bills and meaningless jobs pushing paper and/or harassing men at work.

                    This is the one thing I find hard about being a SAHM. In my neighborhood, the women like me all have their kids a decade later and work FT, and the other SAHMs are immigrant ladies whose complete lack of English skills makes it worthless for them to work. I love being home with the little one, and she’s clearly thriving, but it’s lonely.

It is a shame that women have  made such a mess of things.That being said, you guys let things get a bit out of control.

        An old colleague once gave a sage piece of advice about HR..”they are all socialists at heart” and went on to explain his theory that leftists from his era (Vietnam) who couldn’t get professorships and wanted to make a real living went into the Human Resources racket.  Have yet to encounter any evidence to the contrary.

        “For reasons I’ll never understand, the men in charge of the company decided to pack the HR departments with women who immediately started making mischief.”
This is a simple one. Companies were under pressure to hire more women, and they had nowhere useful to put them where they wouldn’t be a drag on the bottom line. Ergo, stuff them in HR to bring up the numbers.

        Reminds me of the old joke: “What does a woman, a hurricane, a flood, and an earthquake all have in common?
ANSWER:  Sooner or later they’ll get your house.
But seriously, the reason why women will never rule the world is because they have no balls and they can’t get along with each other.

        FNC may be reaching a tipping point with the fake blond thing. Does the network not realize how ridiculous they look? Even poor Greta is a fake blond. These women have all sold a piece of themselves, their dignity to be more precise, to be on television. There will be gnashing of teeth in the wig, hairpiece and hair dye business when the channel crashes, which looks imminent now that the sexual harassment dragon has taken flight.

        This is scary.  Women are terrifying now.  False rape allegations ,  sexual harassment …on and on.   What is terrifying is that this Megyn Kelly ( megan spelled with a “y”no less) is either 1)making this shit up i.e. false witness or 2) she actually believes what happened to her was a sexual harassment and /or misconduct i.e. she’s delusional ( the Michelle Fields effect ) …

        I feel the same way about reporterettes and slavery reparations (and Universal Basic Income, for that matter): Fine, and after this we’re DONE.  Take your check, go in peace, but now any iteration of the words “discrimination,” “racism,” “misogyny,” etc. are jail-time offenses.  There will always be “harassment” in the office – hormones being what they are, someone will always have the hots for someone who doesn’t have the hots back.  Lots of men in the office don’t have game; lots of women in the office get guys to do stuff for them by batting their eyelashes (and in rare cases, vice versa).  Sexual dimorphism’s a bitch.  From now on, a Hot or Not rating is a job requirement for all media bobbleheads.  Rate below X, don’t get hired; fall below Y, get fired for cause.

        Without hating women, they do get bored easily and boredom makes them do all sorts of things. They are also more prone to subjective and not objective judgements, and acting irrationally on them. It is always interesting to hear women who do work who do say they much prefer to work with men as an office full of women in like an extension of a world war.As much as I dislike islam and its posturing, they do tend to keep women away from the work place (some would say though as they tend not to do that much work generally it is a moot point why).

            Feminism and Islam are the bookends of  civilizational dysfunction. One rushes a great civilization into decay, the other smothers it’s flowering. In the war between the sexes it’s best that neither side wins out.

            Sure – watch them read the news.  But it is beyond me why anyone would actually want to hear Megyn Kelly’s opinion on anything.  It’s not like she’s Thomas Sowell or even Katherine Timpf – or anyone who can string together words into a coherent article with a thesis.  She’s bimbo who pretends to ask tough questions while wearing a tight blouse.

        Back when I was working at IBM we had a girl who liked to wear really short skirts.  She would sit on the edge of your desk with her legs apart daring you to look up her skirt.  She spent a lot of time trolling for sexual harassment. Many of us, including our manager, were very happy when she took one of the buyouts and left the company.
