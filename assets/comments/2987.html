        You cannot fight and defeat an enemy if you cannot name him. Jihad is not a noble concept but a Get into Heaven Free card, courtesy of Allah. Ignoring the stated goals of jihadists is not only the height of ignorance and stupidity, but is a good way to lose your head. The Islamists mean business, at the point of a sword if necessary, and our feckless State department thinks itâ€™s job is to manage perceptions about Islam. Professional dhimmies.
