        It was reasonable for the crazies to demand that normal people tolerate the guy in the dress.No, it wasn’t. It was a terrible decision based on a radical reimagining of Christian ethics.Tolerance has deep roots in Christian ethics to the point where it is a habit of mind for Western people.What the crazies and too many modern Christians call “tolerance” is an entirely modern phenomenon. It wasn’t long ago at all that Christians were still burning heretics. It turns out they were right to do so.Humans have tremendous recency bias. My grandparents were born into a world without the federal income tax or women’s suffrage. My dad was born into a world without Social Security or federal gun control. I was born into a world without Medicare, the Civil Rights Act, the Immigration Act of 1965, “Terry Stops” or the Gun Control Act of 1968.Yet all these things are accepted as virtually unchangeable facts of life by most people living.They’re all just the blink of an eye in the span of human history and most of them will disappear just as quickly as they arrived.

            Yeah, the concept of “fraternal correction” is a foundation of Roman Catholic teaching. It works hand in glove with “tolerance”. So I mind my own business until there are dudes in the Ladies’ Room bothering my wife.

                Old-fashioned “tolerance” kept most homosexuals in the closet, i.e., it was a strictly limited sort of tolerance. Keep out of my face and I will ignore your perversion. Flaunt it and you will regret it.

I don’t know whether we’ve yet hit “Peak Dyke”, but there an helluva lotta females out there who are completely screwed up psycho-sexually [thanks to the Frankfurt School &amp; the Council of the Sanhedrin].

            Correct.
christianity does NOT tell you not to judge people; it tells you to use judgement. Any ideology that goes against this basic truth of the human condition is bound to fail.

            So true. Especially about what Christianity has been turned into. I mean, Nancy Pelosi truly believes that she is an authentic Christian. Changing the world for the better. Will go to heaven. All of it.
There is a LOT of this out there.
Their pseudo-Christianity won’t abide. Dross burned off as the cultural forge heats up.

            “Tolerance” is not a Christian virtue. The shitlibs love to talk about how Jesus interacted with the dregs of society, prostitutes and usurers and the like, but never talk about what he told them. Which was not to sin anymore. We are to love the homosexual as a fallen human being like all of us while refusing to accept their sinful and destructive behavior.

                Yes. Christ was intolerant of the Pharisees and their Jewish temple-coin swindle. He was intolerant of their hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and moral preening. He was intolerant of how they used picayune interpretations of the Jewish law to screw people over. He was enraged by them and called them “vipers” who would burn in hell.
The idea that Christianity requires “tolerance” of sin and perversion is bunk. It requires patience that people will eventually “see the light” and renounce sin.

            All real science is based on logic applied to what evidence exists…HBD is based on mounds of evidence, both genetic DNA and practical, and no contrary evidence..Whereas Covid and the mRNA “vaccine” which has wreaked so much havoc, were articles of faith, not evidence.No affirmative evidence existed…Indeed, the real and very negative evidence was doctored and/or suppressed…Their victims died or were crippled because of an implicit faith in government and Pharma…Some referred to them, cruelly but accurately, as Darwin Award winners..Did some HBD supporters fall for this?  Absolutely..But it was ever thus…British men flocked to the enlistment stations in 1914, because newspapers and clowns like Churchill told them that the war would be over by Christmas…against what some have termed the greatest Field Army in history…

            Agreed. To the extent that “tolerance” is a Christian virtue it signals Christian subjugation to postmodern Leftism. In other words, tolerance is not the essence of Christ’s teachings, let alone the Old Testament fire-breathers; it is a cynical point of ideology for the New Left. And it is cynical because it is disengenous. Leftists have no interest in tolerance. Far from it. They simply demand that white people embrace all that is loathesome and pernicious, while exhorting non-whites to condemn whites and all forms of normalcy. To the extent that Christianity abandoned Christ and replaced him with Saint Lacan and Saint Althusser, it began promulgating this warped form of “tolerance.” God is not dead, but Christianity is on life support.

                    I always found that those who screech intolerance are indeed the most intolerant. I have the sad privilege of working with lefties and liberals and often bait them with loaded questions to test their tolerance. It’s very interesting to drop in statements like “People from the southern states of America actually have a lot of qualities” and see the reaction from the folks who have the “Hate has no home here!” signs on their front lawns.

“Anal Pete” Buttgeig and all of Hollywood would disagree. Given the chance, they would happily conceive or “conceive” all kinds of genetic mutants and horrors to inflict upon the world so they can get likes on social media. They already mutilate perfectly healthy children.

                    Genetic? It can’t reproduce, thus is not passed on.
It’s a birth defect. That wiring is delicate. Twists that occur in the womb doesn’t mean genetically determined, but chemically, such as in a hormone imbalance or from psych meds, before birth.
These poor people agonizing over the fact they’ll never have grandkids can stop blaming themselves, they usually tried to do their best. A birth defect in the wiring, simple as. Still a tragedy.
Since it is externally determined, it can be…”taught”. A danger.

In some cases, no doubt, but I rather suspect that the majority of instances result from sexual abuse in early childhood.

                I doubt they will find any such single gene. There will be multiple genes associated with homosexuality and other such personality traits. I note that identical twin studies have suggested a strong environmental factor in homosexual attraction. The pre-1970s psychologists noted a frequent association with men raised without fathers or weak fathers and domineering mothers. That situation is more common today than ever.

                    I have heard–and it may sound slightly counterintuitive–that boys whose fathers express little affection for them are much more likely to become heauxmeaux than are boys whose fathers bestow affection abundantly. The theory is that, once the “unloved” boys grow up, they seek the desiderated male affection they were denied when they were children. And the seeking becomes sexual in nature.

                        Sounds quite likely. Gangbangers, as a corollary, find the “family” bonds they were missing as children. The cold callousness and excessive violence of English public schools bred how many closeted males.

                                No reproduction would be my guess, a sneaky way to reduce population. Fits with my theory that all the easy to access resources are gone and we’ve got too many people. Also creates division and fights over things that have nothing to do with correcting bad economics. If you think about it, this shit didn’t really explode onto the scene until after 08. No jobs, no kids, expensive houses, no kids…………. have some drugs instead, oh you OD’d? Sorry about that.  Just one less person to demand accountability.

                    Undoubtedly environmental factors have caused the explosion in perversion, but homo is a naturally occurring mutation observed in a minute portion of almost all mammal populations. My point is if it is identified, no matter how small of a factor, there will be a rush to prevent homo abortions. But, yeah, it didn’t explode from one or two percent to a quarter due to an accelerated natural mutation.

                            The point of the 24/7 propaganda is to produce an endless stream of victims to satiate a ravenous appetite for sadism. And, yes, you are expected to be tolerant of sadism, too. No telling how many boners are produced by Munchausen moms parading their freshly mutilated sons before the camera. That kink probably has a wider audience than sodomy, and even in a thoroughly depraved society, it stands out as disgusting, no small feat.

I’m sorry, but that sentence cracked–so to speak–me up. Perhaps it is the overtones of Orwell.

                    Ouch. There apparently aresomegenetic tendencies towards common homosexuality. Even Dads, as one of the workers building the refineries in Saudi Arabia in 1948, said Arabs (Semitics) were nothing but buggery. And crude vulgarity is a mainstay that keeps popping up in Judeosemitic culture.

            Nobody wants gay kids, even Anal Pete or Madonna. That’s why CRISPR and gene-editing is so controversial. If people could choose what their kids looked like, humanity would soon all look like the Brady Bunch. We’d be Orania writ large. Melanin would be a unwanted imperfection, like being gay. Not every parent would necessarily want blond/blue Swedemaxxing, but every parent would want a whiter kid with flowing hair.This is terribly unfair and humiliating to our fellow non-whites, and I think deep down every scientist and parent knows this.For what it’s worth, I prefer the diversity of humankind. And beauty is in the eye of the beholder, even though most eyes agree that Kirsten Dunst was hot. I don’t want to mess with God’s diversity.

                    Yes. Denmark is the world’s biggest exporter of sperm – largely due to lax regulation and definitely not because we’re the biggest wankers or anything, but the customers just want tall, blond and smart.
Henrik and Lana were terribly upset by this, they felt the nons were stealing our genes.

            I agree that women in charge are a major problem. I get that individual men are in bind about this, but the women aren’t going to spontaneously give up the power that men gave them. (Also while insisting that women who live out traditional feminine roles is to be a sad, broken low status male.) Y’all are going to have to figure out how to deal with your brothers who are all in on the “Make Women Men Again” project.

                    See also: woman who crashed her copter into a plane.  It took many months but the feds finally (kinda) told the truth about it.
As I predicted, it was a chick and essentially she ignored the advice of her flight instructor, that advice being don’t fly into the airplane you idiot.
I guess she showed everybody who’s boss!

                    Make a sentence out of “hard times” and “strong men”. That’s what is coming. And even today, if you sit down outside a bar and watch the world go by, it’s noticeable that all the REALLY important jobs that keep the world turning are still being done by men. Male truckers and farmers go on strike and the world starves.

                            Thomas Sowell echoed that. The only way to understand political events is to remember that pols are in it for their own interests. All of them. Here in Europe, excremental pols like Starmer, Macron, Merz and Von der Lying are busy destroying their nations, the EU and their own political careers so they can do the bidding of their financial masters.

                Don’t we already have them, in Cuba and now El Salvador? They just haven’t worked up the nerve to send citizens, especially heritage citizens, there. If/when the democrats get in again they will sure want to, and to use Trump as an excuse to do it. Hopefully by then people will be over their excuses, but I doubt it.

            Very interesting. I have relatives in the same grade who have a litter box in the classroom debate. I wonder if it is a common theme or we know the same people in the same situation.Fwiw, I know the youngsters in this situation have been so bombarded with pro-homo anti-White propaganda that very young people hate homos and I suspect are fomenting other “hatreds.” They are sick to death of wondering why strangers are worshiped and they are neglected. I wonder how many kids the regime has turned against it. For certain, it is the ones who are spiritually healthy who have. Hopefully, that means the right “we” will be the stronger side and win.

                That litter box thing is years old. So, that’s weird.
But anyway, they try not to tell them about actual sex, you see. So, most of them don’t even realize what homo means besides rainbows and unicorns and glitter and love and ‘standing up for civil rights’.

                    Oh my gods, Stephanie, you’re right. They aren’t even told to expect that heady swoon of puberty. They’re groomed to mistake an ugly groping for it.
As Reality says, if these kids aren’t swinging Templar broadswords in an orgy of vengeance by the time they’re 20, I’ll be surprised.The Crusades aredefinitelycoming back.

                That’s my experience in education too. It’s all counter-productive. I get it that certain groups haven’t been treated well in the past and some kind of adjustment is necessary, but it’s the constant bombardment of propaganda and ever shriller lauding of sexual perversion that is turning kids against the ideologues. They aren’t “fascists”; they are just sick and tired of it all.

            I don’t see why a girl who want’s us to pretend she is a cat is any different than a girl who wants us to pretend she is a boy.  She just wants the constant attention she gets with every little action and reaction to her make-believe.
Likewise, a boy who says he is a cat is no different that a boy who wants us to pretend he’s a girl.  He just wants the thrill of watching everyone submit to his make believe.
But, yes:  Society needs to crush this madness by not playing along.  At all.

                Indeed, and i also think we should put the breaks on hard for the women who use social media and such to wring money out of SIMPS.  Not saying we need to go back to Victorian era of modesty, but even the 40’s or 50’s would be better then now.  My four year old niece is jealous of her two year old brother.  It starts at a young age, all he wants to do is give her hugs.

        I think that guys like Steve Sailer really did believe (there’s that word!) that once the crazies saw the brilliance of his arguments and the lucidity with which he made them, they would come around. Or, if not quite come around, be so impressed with him and his overall reasonableness – after all, he’s not demanding power or any major policy changes based on the logical endpoint of his brilliant arguments – that they would begrudgingly invite him to the cool kid’s table.This is why, when push came to shove, the Sailer-types crumpled in the face of liberal power and bent the knee. Ultimately the only thing that matters is power. If you don’t agree, you just get shut out. It’s that simple. The entire construction of transgenderism is insane and totally at odds with the materialist perspective of the rest of the liberal project (“born in a different body”), but it doesn’t matter. The only way to change it is to acquire power.

                It’s not just COVID, although that was a flashpoint. It’s that he will write an article about, for example, data that shows blacks to be low IQ and violent, but will never discuss the implications of this fact or what to do about it, especially in a system that demands we all conform to this cohort. For him it’s just an intellectual exercise, trying to impress people with his clear writing and conscise arguments. If you read the comments of his blog, it always descended into trivialities as it seems he attracted people who think just like him.

                Steyn’s much smarter, even now that he’s lost a couple dozen IQ points to age and illness, but to him everything is subservient to one never quite expressed value: Jewish supremacy.
He blasts what he calls the “professional Jews” (ADL, neocons, etc.)—for good reasons,andfor not being good for the Jews—but rejects everything and everyone from which he catches a whiff of antisemitism, often imaginary. He’d reject himself for it, if he weren’t himself.
(Sailer’s like that too, but less so.)
Caring about only one thing, especially a thing you won’t talk about, is perverse.

                Steyn is more or less fully based at this point, and not due to shifting wind. He is the only mainstream sort I know who frequently points out the absurdity of claiming there are legal/constitutional restraints on anything. Not going along with that fiction assures permanent expulsion from proximity to liberal power. Also, Sailer was a Covidian and Steyn one of the very few who pointed out the farcical nature of the entire psyop.
Steyn won’t go near the JQ because (a) he is down with the Tribe and (b) tangentially part of it. Other than that, based.

        The key belief— which is true— is that men are more rational, women are more emotional. Many goods will follow. Men figure things out, women intuit them. A man who isn’t in control of his emotions is dangerous. A woman who thinks she’s in control of hers is just as dangerous, but in a different way. Etc.

        no one has ever hoped their child would grow up to be a happy, healthy homosexual
Probably true as recently as 10 or 15 years ago. Not true today. Appears to be mostly confined to white folks. Alas.
We have always been governed by belief over facts. Probably always will be. But being governed by feelings over facts is more of a 19th amendment thing.

            In fairness to the Fair Sex, we men have been in charge most of the time and that hasn’t prevented individuals, groups and entire cultures from believing in batshit-crazy stuff. Indeed, I’ll go so far as to say that virtually every human being holds at least a few batshit-crazy concepts, no matter his level of education. You or I may be smug enough to think we’re immune to that. Well, good luck with that! There were very good reasons that science and other forms of disciplined thought used to have rigorous rules of testing and proof, etc. Such intellectual tools as skepticism, the demand for proof, inquiry etc. have never been real popular and as Z notes today, they in fact get a chilly reception even where one would think they’d be tools of the trade, like in academia.In sum: it ispossibleto find the answers to some (but not all) questions. But there are terrific motivations against even asking those questions, much less doing all the heavy lifting of mounting the actual investigation. Much of the reluctance to probe too deeply is likely due to subconscious fears it might overturn cherished beliefs.

                I found Nietzsche’s view on women. He didn’t disrespect or disregard them at all; instead, he respected them as a force of Nature, raw and untamed, the urgent, amoral, driving insistence of Life itself, absent the abstract philosophizing of men’s intellectual fairy castles.

            If a biological cause for homosexuality is isolated, it will be fun to watch those who advocate for the genetic testing and abortion of the infirm (which I do) turn on a dime and declare it a moral outrage (I won’t).

            ‘But being governed by feelings over facts is more of a 19th amendment thing.’
That’s what is killing the nation, because now it’s ALL feelings. Facts and the truth exist to further the ideo-political narrative, or  they are ignored, excised or weaponized.

        Way before Galileo, the Greeks had the story of Prometheus, who stole the secret of fire from the Gods. The Gods proceeded to torment him eternally. It’s in our nature as human to probe the outer edges of our capabilities through Science. And for our hubris, the Gods mete out the condign punishments and torments: the WNBA, Rachel Levine, Fauci and CNN. We must rebuild the Temple of Apollo………

            Galileo is the story of an advocate of “science” who couldn’t mind his business. If he had lived in Islam we wouldn’t even know his name, let alone have some unnecessary apology about the whole business hundreds of years later. Copernicus, a devout Catholic had the done most of actual work before him. The more things change, the more they stay the same.Also, I’m a part time grammar Nazi (I live to serve.) Capitals on nouns make them proper, as in a specific name. Common nouns/categories are lower case.It’s “gods”, a category of supernatural beings who have some sort of control over the universe.  “God” is the name of one specific entity, what people understand to the uncreated Creator, the entity who created the gods.If I have typos or grammar problems, please feel free to make fun of them, because I’ve always needed an editor or 12.

                I capitalize words for emphasis, like Thomas Jefferson or Thomas Pynchon in Mason &amp; Dixon. You do you.I agree on Galileo. That said, there was an element of “show trial” in his story. I think the Church was just trying to make him bow to their authority. I doubt they had a big issue with his work per se.Contrast Galileo’s situation with the HBD and Charles Murray types today. I’d argue today’s “heretics” are in more danger than was Galileo.

If memory serves, the main issue was that Galileo wanted the Church to revise the Biblical account of Creation on the basis of his heliocentric theory, for which he could offer no concrete proof.

                The Greeks not only held the non-heliocentric view of the Universe, they applied their math to proving and measuring the relative size and distances of the heavenly bodies they could best observe. A lot of the Renaissance was the fall of Byzantium stimulating Europe to preserve that knowledge that they took for granted that Byzantium was safe guarding. Galileo and those guys just rediscovered this and began new inquiries.Coincidentally, the knowledge of Greco-Roman culture was taken over by the Muslims when they had the knowledge of those libraries. That accounts for their temporary spike in medical knowledge … … They gained some knowledge they didn’t have before. They didn’t prove capable of advancing it or even sustaining its preservation for very long.

                    That the Greeks determined empirically that the Earth was round, the heliocentric solar system, as well as a rough estimate for the Earth’s diameter using simple stuff like the Pythagorean calculation and and the like shows what fools the flat Earth people are as well as those who do not believe outer space exists, That the Greeks did all of this long before the birth of Christ means it cannot be a conspiracy against Christianity since the Christian religion didn’t even exist at the time.

                Gods, this insistence on the Judaic One God, One Source concept is such an errant set of blinders. One wag at Unz pointed out you can date the decline of Roman art and architecture by following the rise of Christianity.
Really, Christianity was a Roman appeal to the unradicalized, Aramaic-speaking Jewish population. Even so, I’d rather not return to the Roman virtus of pitiless cruelty. Worshipping the Healer is a tradeoff I can readily abide by.

More of a logical inevitability. Greek philosophers were promulgating the idea of a single universal source long before the birth of Christ, after all.

                    I said “uncreated Creator” for a reason. Most pagan religions have some sort of Father or Creator God that creates the gods. It’s not just the ancient Israelite or Christian version I was referring to. What made the ancient Israelites unique was refusing to add to the uncreated Creator any sort of other gods.Rome was truly well in her decline by the time of Christianity. It was an empire by then and no longer a republic. Christianity rises in a time of social disorder in a civilization much like ours and that was already in motion.I’m sure people will look back on any sincere rise in the Christian faith and blame our current chaos on it too. The reality was about society who had already abandoned virtue, like ours has. Christianity might have been the only social force keeping anything together, like ours now.

                        What made the ancient Israelites unique was refusing to add to the uncreated Creator any sort of other gods.
Lucifer and his fellow rebel angels occupy essentially the same space as the lower-case gods of pagan mythology. Uniquely, though, rather than murdering and supplanting their creator, they are instead defeated, cast out of heaven and condemned to hell.

        Two things. First, the belief habit-of-mind had to precede the invention of science because our species’ cognitive skill lagged our complex language skill development. Our ancestors needed to “believe and adopt” ancient wisdom before we could rationalize why. Second, civilization has killed natural selection and our species continues to devolve absent effective culling. In the modern era, stupidity is killing science adoption, not irrational belief per se. This will continue until colony collapse, probably via a worldwide nuclear war.

        Late comment on yesterday’s post from the mighty Z.Generational hate fests are usually stupid and counter productive. They fulfill the need of white men to find other whites to hate but are intended to pit Whites against each other and divert whites from the true problem.By the mid 60s Jews had consolidated power and were ready to completely transform America culturally, politically and demographically. Boomers got swept up in that as has every subsequent generation.The Clinton crime family was more of a symptom of this change. Clinton was the jovial smiling face on the destruction of the working class. His strongest supporters were the women the Jews unleashed on the country with feminism 2.0 which was almost entirely a Jewish project supported by the almost entirety Jewish entertainment and news media. These women are still the most ardent inforcers of our new Weimar at every level of the country.So each generation brings something unique to the table but they aren’t the ones pulling the strings. In the legislature we have silent (still!), boomer, X and Millennials. What they all have in common is they do the bidding of AIPAC and primarily Jewish donors. Most have the same worldview. They just differ on the extent and speed of the changes for their masters.

            Did you catch Hillary’s most recent psychopathic confession on camera? She openly confessed her desire for White genocide.This does dovetail with a consistent theme on Z’s blog. At the core of the Z-blog in my view is the theme of tradition.Even though rulers and leaders have been philanderers and facilitated by the female’s desire for the most powerful male, tradition put moral boundaries around it. You could not stop the philanderer, but you could make it morally wrong. This had several effects. One, in the West it allowed us to keep our genetic diversity and keep the energy of most men contributing toward the civilization as they all could have their own family and invest in it. A few guys did not get all of the women.As important is that it put a box of shame and some prohibition around the strongest and most powerful men. It told them that they were not to abandon their higher duties and succumb to lust. Even when such men did exist there was a court around them, that if they did not fall to such base living, could protect the society from a man fallen to desire. Part of this is to prevent the man from falling under Eve or Delilah or Hera’s spell.Bill Clinton is carney trash. His wife is a viper – a psychopathic Delilah figure who hates men and hates nature. That is on display in her most recent open confession that she desires the total eradication of her kind – all in the name of liberating women.Yes that tribe and its perfidy and its telluric and man-centered pseudo-religion which is really self worship of a people placed above God disguised as God placing them above the rest of man did massive damage.However, looking at that Hillary bit, it may turn out to be that Occidental man not telling Clinton to get control of his woman and put her in her place or just doing the needful and burning her at the stake in absence of his will to do so, was our undoing. The damage done since 1992 to America and The West is inestimable. Looking at the avarice of Hillary Clinton one has to say that unleashing her was unleashing demons.Fwiw, I have encountered people who are deeply connected to the Clintons. I think that Hillary is a demon come to earth who is systematically coordinating the destruction of man. Hillary Clinton is deeply connected to the systematic cultivation of the homosexual and drug/psychedelic underground that is organizing as an emergent replacement for Christianity. Think ahayuasca dens in place of China’s opium dens. I am not joking. I bet if you unearthed her and her activities one would find a coordinated and determined Satanic angel spending every day unleashing chaos and destruction. There are armies of broken women out there whose emptiness is a space that demonic energy can occupy and animate to do unspeakable evil. I have met some who spend time with Hillary Clinton.After Hillary’s latest confession, I think if society wants to fix itself it needs to have a reckoning with her and stop turning away. She isn’t just some ambitious harpy. At this point, knowing her heritage you have to think she is an unculled blood relative of those who inspired the need to take drastic measures and cast demons to the fires of hell lest they do the same to us.

                Wow great post.
Hillary is more like Jezebel than Delilah.  Essentially, the West lives under the rule of Jezebel 2.  America is command center for this global effort.
‘I bet if you unearthed her and her activities one would find a coordinated and determined Satanic angel spending every day unleashing chaos and destruction’
You would win that bet.  An angel of significant rank.

                The problem is that there are millions of would be Hilaries. Hillary only got to the top because of her husband.
Rather than think of her as a demon (which she is), I like Ed Duton’s perspective on witches. He wrote a book on how it was sane for our forebearers to tackle the witch problem and that modern feminists are simply their modern version.

                    Just from reading, i think hillary has always been a carpet muncher.  That is why she never left Bill for all his missteps.  She needed him and i think he needed her, purely political couple (evil).  I think Huma Abadin was hillarys girlfriend, followed the same playbook, marry some weirdo and but sleep with hillary.  Now she’s married to the younger soros.

                                    When it comes to evaluating the various Clinton conspiracy theories the problem is that it’s hard to ruleanyof them out. The only ones I’d think too far fetched would be something about the Clintons being Reptoid aliens or vampires. Even the latter thing could be sort of true if the adrenochrome harvesting stories have some truth to them.
Both of the Clintons seem to be in the same league as people like Elizabeth Bathory, Caligula, Jim Jones, or Manson. They are creatures of that twilight realm that spawns cult leaders and serial killers.

            Generational differences are real. The people most likely to not acknowledge them are Boomers (ironic) and older Gen Xers. Silents/Boomers as group did not have to go along with the Jewish project, as their uncles and fathers often knew better and expressed it privately. Silents/Boomers did not have to quite often throw the baby out with the bathwater when it came to what they inherited culturally/religiously.  They did not have to believe the Jews about women, did not have to believe the Jews that they were justified in abandoning their family in both directions (children/parents), and that money would solve all their problems including “no war”. (This is funny, because no one seemed more eager to do away with the Palestians than Boomers as a group) I do recall all sorts of public objections along the way of the 20th century, that all largely disappeared once the Boomers came of age.Tucker Carlson was talking recently about the sins of violence and greed, which are very real. He was asking why we talk about racism, but not those. The answer from many older people especially was that the Democrats were the real racists.*ahem*“The Jews made me do it” is no justification in this life or the next. In that a discussion of the Jewish question with multiple Peter Pan generations is probably pointless. It’s just another scapegoat.All that said, do flame wars between generations help? Probably not. But if the goal is to avoid them, the answer is not “generations do not really exist (but White does) and if they did, it’s all the Jew’s fault we’re here.” All it takes is some sympathy between the generations.

                This is a good summation of the generation issue. Each generation, given modernity and burning down of tradition, is different. But for an embattled and radically outnumbered people, dispossessed and stateless, to be infighting over such petty and stupid things is really stupid. Empathy is more what we need. We need empathy for those who won’t save themselves, and just to ignore the generation of those who are joining the fight. The friend enemy distinction is not one generation vs. another, it is those of any generation who will stand and confront and fight against our destruction vs those who fight for our destruction. Attacking those on the sidelines is really stupid. At some point some may rise in sympathy and realization of a shared fate. Best not attack them and let our enemies do the work on that front.

        There is no “science” conducted to the benefit of the people. There is plenty of science conducted to the detriment of the people.
What was once, and for Joe Q. Normie was known as “science” is now more potently deployed by what is HIDDEN, than what is REVEALED.
Jab? Autopen? Autism? Ad infinitum.
My suggestion is to stay away from the medical community as much as possible…. perhaps if a bone is sticking out of your leg. Otherwise, second guess, research…. I have way too many FIRST HAND experiences to think otherwise.

        Very pungent and pertinent essay. As you say, facts have no power against beliefs, and in particular, fantastical beliefs. Your example of homosexuality is a perfect one. To most sane heterosexuals (and even many homosexuals), the reality of homosexuality seems appalling: multiple shallow sexual relationships, terrible diseases, mental illness, addictions, a shorter life expectancy and a sexual act that involves sticking an extremity where no extremity should be stuck. Convincing people to call this lifestyle “gay” must be one of the greatest marketing successes in history. However, all around me, I see the propaganda painting this lifestyle as the absolute zenith of human existence! This kind of magical thinking only fades and fails when it confronts stone cold reality. I’m rather glad that this is what our society is facing as it hurtles towards a Fourth Turning.

        Science has been corrupted not just by ideology but also by good old-fashioned greed. The Covid debacle was an intersection of both, with the ideologues demanding submission to the crazy mandates and the Pharma corporations getting rich while their “regulators” suppressed info on the actual risk and benefits of the mRNA vaccines. Even MAHA has not been able so far to eliminate the damned things.

            mRNA medicine has been The Next Big thing for nearly 20 years, but Big Pharma could never close the deal. Then Covid came along and the perfect opportunity to use the whole global population as guinea bigs and get their chums in Big Gubmint to ban all alternative meds and any liability. It worked. Big Pharma and Eichmann Bourla are now moving on to the greatest golden egg of them all: mRNA cancer “cures”. Thanks a bunch, normies!

        What happened to Galileo is a poor example as it had very little to do with belief versus science or some sort of dogmatic opposition to heliocentrism, though that is the version of events the Enlightenment popularized. His trouble arose from using stellar parallax specifically as a basis without being able to adequately prove it, and teaching it as certitude in church-run institutions that employed him despite admonitions not toin that arena.The church’s counterarguments were based much more on Brahe than Scripture, and Galileo additionally failed to do himself any favors by publishing a tract that at minimum appeared to be personally insulting to the pope, after said pope, previously of a friendly disposition, had encouraged him to compile a comprehensive comparison of both theories. Stellar parallax was not definitively measured for another two centuries, though the church had already begun to accept heliocentrism well before then on other grounds.

        Somewhat OT, or perhaps not, the dude who went from Illinois to DC to assassinate two young Israeli Embassy workers (they were engaged, and yes straight) raises many questions.A. In Illinois, where did he get the weapon? It is very difficult for non-criminal ordinary people to get a firearm in that state.B. How did he get the money to travel there, and who funded him? He seems some Soros Left Crazy, not earning any money.C. How did he know there was an event there at the Museum, and how did he know the people he killed were Israelis?D. Will we see more of this, and will this drive away even the commited Jews sans Bernie from the Left?E. Will the DOJ use this to go after Soros and company. As Churchill once said, if Hitler invaded Hell, he’d at least work in a favorable reference to the Devil in a speech in Parliament.—It seems the crazies are just getting in the way continually. The Party (there is only one) cannot back away from them, they get an anger rush endorsing the crazy. They seem to need it like an addict. This means more and more science will be taboo, as the crazy amps up, and that’s in direct conflict with the military which needs newer and better weapons to counter act that massive Chinese scale advantage in manufacturing. Particularly in space where the US has its only signficant advantage.Over/Under of Regime Change in South Africa after the Oval Office visit? This was prepared for a reason. Moral justification to kick out the current Regime there which host Chinese bases and pursues legal action against “our greatest ally?”

                Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have restrictions on magazine fed firearms (limits, etc), and all require like Illinois a purchase to permit, some like Massachusetts or New York have strict limits on how many guns can be purchased per year and month. Others like California have a roster of approved only firearms, very limited. California used to have one gun a month, that was removed on appeal and the state chose not to further appeal it because of the 20% tax money is keeping the state finances semi-afloat (still a sizeable deficit).It is difficult for most, normal, law abiding people or those not plugged into criminal networks to get a firearm. This is because the majority of people live in hard Blue States, like NY, Maryland, Illinois, or the West Coast. For dirtbag criminals, yes no issue to get a stolen firearm etc. That’s not normal people though. The shooter was an English Major, active in BLM circles (but not black himself). Does not appear to be a dirt bag criminal, those guys don’t hang around making statements.I wonder though, will the DOJ use this as an excuse to roll up the Soros network? Charge a bunch of people? I wonder how this guy knew the event was happening, why he deliberately executed both and how he got and paid for the gun. Supposedly he was in DC for a job interview, not sure how reliable that info is, who would hire that guy?

                    Actually Oregon is trying to force us to get a permit to purchase any gun but the measure that inflicted this on us is still under injunction and will hopefully never go into effect. There are also some interesting actions in the Supreme Court which may finally void this and the magazine capacity limits that will be part of the same measure.Oregon is odd for a hard Left state in that guns are still almost as available as in a Red State. The Democrazies have consolidated their stranglehold on the state in the last few years and are looking to Californicate us as much as they can. A lot of Oregon gun control measures are a Demoncrat attempt to distract stupid woman voters from the multiplicity of disasters they’ve inflicted on the state. Gun grabbing is basically the only remaining way Oregon’s slimy politicians have of pretending to care even a tiny bit about crime or to be on the side of anyone but the criminals.

            Good find. From the small print:
“… … No prior knowledge of chemistry or African American studies is required for engagement in this course.”
No prior knowledge required!! There you have it. In only 55 years the Occidental University has been turned into a cargo cult lab.

        ‘After all, no one has ever hoped their child would grow up to be a happy, healthy homosexual’I only wish that were true.  It’s become trendy with some celebrity and UC women to do just that, wallowing in their own spite.  Raise their boys as girls, their girls as boys.  All the rage in Holly Wood these days.  Where is daddy?  Gone.  He’d only get in the way of her plans.Modern Christian tolerance is watered-down current culture, not the Scripture Christians are supposed to follow.  Aside from elements no longer in application — like Hebrew dietary laws — the Old Testament is not dead and still applies, despite the denials of many pastors and preachers.  I find the OT eminently functional and use it for many practical purposes, including as an oracle.The OT is not tolerant.  Neither is the NT, for that matter.  That’d be to confuse Christian charity with self-destructive permissiveness.  We don’t need a new scripture or religion, but just to follow seriously the one we’ve got.  There’s plenty on the plate there.‘In the end, science tells us that it is always who shall overcome whom.’This world tells us the same thing.  It’s a fight so hitch up your jeans.

        The world’s largest economy is under no illusions about equality. Ask a Chinaman if he and an African are one race, and he will explain that his ancestors were composing poetry while blacks were still swinging in the branches.In fact, China runs eugenics programs to create world class athletes. The future is about ruthless racial science that would make Eichmann recoil. Even in America. Take the most progressive love is love, in this house we believe, woman and put her in a sperm bank and you will find Himmler’s spirit physically manifesting over her shoulder.I, for one, welcome our future Chinese overlords.

        Knowing how people think is paramount to the understanding of the human condition. Who am I going to believe? Facts are facts. Acceptance is different than tolerance. That being said scientific method has a lot going for it. We are not the same, we are not equal,they are not like us. Stoicism also has a lot going for it. Derangement syndromes seem to be prevalent in a lot of folks. A bug or a feature. I say bug. Even the deepest thinkers must refresh fundamental data regularly. If nothing else to maintain a needed level of sanity. Happy Trails.

        I’ve said for years that abortion will be forever banned if it is ever proven that homosexuality is a genetic trait.  You will see people flip on that issue faster than you can say, “Mary Sue”.  And with that ban will come bans on generic testing.Trump has successfully jujitsu’d the opposition into taking the “science” and “facts/law” side of multiple issues in the country.  In contrast, Trump is making the moral arguments.  The result is the plainly obvious fact that the opposition openly supports murderous gang members, groomers, weirdos in dresses, runaway government corruption and theft, weaponized courts, and endless wars…all backed by “But…science!”

        Again somewhat OT, saw Rubio jousting against Chris Van Hollen. It was interesting. Van Hollen reminded Rubio they had been Senate Colleagues and that he voted to confirm Rubio believing that Rubio would “curb” Trump from “violating the Constitution and offending our allies.” And that he regretted that vote. Five years ago that line would have worked. Instead it did not, Rubio hit back at the guy for having Margueritas with Abel Garcia, wife beater and MS-13 gang member, and promised more visa yanking of foreign students who cause trouble.Interestingly, Van Hollen talked about the tens of thousands of starving Gaza kids, largely debunked as the videos that ran were of Yemen. Not Gaza. Blasted Rubio for not siding with Gaza, and “disrespecting our greatest Ally, Ukraine.” Van Hollen also quoted Cindy McCain blasting Israel and Trump for not “saving Gaza” and McCain also on how racist it is to take White South Africans instead of most of Sudan. No, literally.I took a couple of takeaways from this. First Rubio is all in. He was happy to blast Van Hollen back. I assume it is because he knows there is no forgiveness on the Left. He had open contempt for Van Hollen who kept interupting his response.Second, the Dems are all in Cindy McCain as a moral authority. They have under the pressure from the crazy left abandoned our traditional “greatest ally” in favor of Ukraine. They do want war with Russia over Ukraine. Dems are also all in on Gaza. And the Palestinians. Van Hollen is Establishment of the Establishment. Just look at the guy. So if that’s the Establishment just imagine how AOC or Jasmine Crockett, the Presidential and VP nominees in 2028, are going to be. These guys are stupid. They are running the 2008/2012 playbook and thinking it will work. Rubio is not a hero, he’s the tool of the Military Industrial Complex. But it seems that the MiC has turned as it inevitably would against the Baizu and wants them crushed.To bring back to the topic, could we see a repeat of Ike’s surge in science and flyover White guys against DEI just to get advances against the Chinese? The one advantage we have over them is that they have been miserable in Space launches, as that is one area where cheap and fast do not work. [Tends to explode on launch].

            All I can conclude is Rubio either didn’t have principles before, doesn’t have them now, or most likely never had them to begin with. He saw which way the wind was blowing and got on Team Trump because he has his eyes on the Big Prize after Trump is gone (as do Vance, Noem, probably Blondi too). But to his credit he is being an excellent Team Trump player. At least outwardly.

not sure if this is a scandal or a nothingburger. It seems that NGOs want yes men and not independent actors. Politicians in the 70s and 80s I feel were savvier (think Bill Clinton or Mario Cuomo)

        We can now identify maladaptive people with a very high degree of accuracy long before we have to find out the hard way through brain scans &amp; genetic sequencing. Our society currently has no environmental based genetic filter in place to weed out people who are hardwired to attempt to destroy civilization. Even before modernity the genetic detritus still built up until the majority of the population was completely incapable of maintaining itself it just took a lot longer.With the knowledge &amp; technology we have now we could do the equivalent of what islam has accomplished via constantly kneecapping intelligence &amp; thus preventing liberalization with inbreeding depression. The national socialists attempted this generally, obviously configured to their own race specifically with crude &amp; often brutal methods that are no longer necessary. At the very least we can brain scan people &amp; if they’re degenerative make it so they cannot have any influence &amp; also sterilize them.But imagine we could go even further, I assume it will never happen due to catch-22 nature of humanity ensuring the cycle will never end but in theory we could end the cycle of decline &amp; rebirth in the opposite direction of islam. Instead of preventing ascension we prevent decay, that’s a lot harder to do but we’re certainly equipped with the technology &amp; intelligence to accomplish it just not the will. We could utterly eliminate people who do not care about truth, we could even remove automaton NPCs entirely &amp; live like the jetsons with AI &amp; automation doing all the monotonous work. I’d like to note that the NPC is a collection of personality traits, one does not need a high IQ to recognize obvious realities.Its unfortunate that humanity seems to be doomed to always regress back to savagery. White people came so close to cracking the high intelligence continuity of civilization code but by the time the ingredients that made that possible were discovered the masses were already well on their way to regressing back to savage supremacy. It is fascinating how even higher intelligent people can effectively be one degree removed from the most primitive &amp; barbaric savages, its a reminder that IQ is not at all the end all be all but merely a component of a safe White civilization.A lot of people erroneously blame Christianity for our decline as if it has the power to alter the minds of men but it doesn’t. It no more makes a White person a dysgenic supremacist than it makes a nigerian into someone who can maintain a first world country. The fact that is such a common belief among the DR shows the majority of us are still trapped in this magical thinking that denies reality. Their desire is correct but their belief in the means of achieving their goal is no more detached from reality than E Michael Jones belief that holy water will transform Ben Shapiro into someone indistinguishable from a typical European. The idea that if Christianity was expunged from the West people like Jeff Metcalf would’ve been one of us is absurd on the face of it.That’s just one example, a popular one, but its not about that religion or lack thereof specifically but the underlying beliefs from the people themselves. It is true that Christianity in the anglosphere especially is now, for the most part, essentially an ideological proxy for being a dysgenic supremacist but again that’s a reflection of the people themselves. It’s not a coincidence that these people implicitly &amp; sometimes even explicitly denounce their ancestors as metaphysically evil monsters for not worshipping nons. Those people could’ve been indoctrinated into esoteric ethnocentric fascism from birth &amp; would’ve still grew up to worship savages, they would’ve figured out a way to twist or interpret the codex to fit with their innate desire for savage supremacy.Whatever is in the hearts of a particular group will manifest no matter what, in the end ideology &amp; religious belief is a product of genetics. That is the inescapable reality &amp; whatever fantastical beliefs a high functioning society is to have must acknowledge that either directly or by proxy if it is to last. It also needs to acknowledge the environmental effects of a low mortality rate &amp; the lack of danger that comes with modernity that makes people far more tolerant than they otherwise would’ve been in a pre-industrial society. Obviously there’s other things but if you get those things right you’re in a pretty damn good position to have a healthy &amp; long lasting civilization.I don’t care what ideology or religion we have so long as it is in line with reality, the continuation of people like myself is all that matters to me, everything else is secondary. If that means I have to larp as a pagan then so be it, I’d rather not discard all the European lore that has been built up through Christianity but if it means extinction to cling to it then there’s no other choice. Unfortunately the majority of self proclaimed Christians are actively &amp; willfully destroying it &amp; they’re so numerous that they may very well permanently end the religion for Europeans. Like any other unpleasant reality that’s something I have to accept much the same way I will have to accept that vast chunks of territory will be subsumed by savages within my lifetime.Every religion that has stood the test of time was on some level a proxy belief for reality &amp; adaptive behavior &amp; while some truths are eternal there’s a lot of environmental variance at play. Take the churches adoption of banning first cousin marriages, that was a reactionary adaptation to stave off inbreeding depression &amp; why? For the sake of ascension which was the trajectory of Christianity for a long time until the environment changed &amp; allowed the mass breeding degenerates. Conversely islam adopted first cousin marriages for the sake of deliberately preventing ascension because on a primordial level muslims understand it brings liberalism with it &amp; given the genetic reality of muslim demographics they’re in no position to stop that from taking hold.Getting back on topic, if the White Christian masses want to go extinct whilst transforming the religion into a degenerative savage worshipping cult there is little can do to we cannot stop them, we are an extreme minority unfortunately. We may agree on a lot of things with conservative Christians but they have so far insisted on rejecting the actual core reality that makes or breaks a White civilization. We’ll be lucky to save ourselves from their collective will &amp; there’s no guarantee the people who escape their influence will have any love for the faith. Not saying that’s what’s going to happen just that may very well be how this pans out, those Christians are certainly working very hard to bring about this outcome. You cannot be against immigration or degeneracy or whatever else while simultaneously militantly defending the very people who institute those things. It’s having like a iron clad safe with a backdoor anyone can freely access, it defeats the entire point of having the safe in the first place.We’ve been undergoing rapid changes in the environment for centuries now &amp; the thought leaders, religious or otherwise, have not been able to adapt in time. We were only just beginning to understand the implications of genetic reality &amp; by that point the demographic rot already had a strong foothold. That’s a strong argument for not rushing into new technologies though I don’t know how much more advanced we can get now, whether Whites will be around in the next age all depends on whether the lessons we learn today are accepted or rejected.God willing, if Whites make it through this period of calamity they will accept reality instead of denying it &amp; repeating this all over again, assuming they can even maintain continuity while holding these suicidal beliefs. Time will tell on that, NPCs will go with the flow only up to a certain point before the lies that animate our current culture become a matter of life or death to believe or denounce. It seems like we’re nearing the end of this cycle, the cracks are really starting to show, nothing ever happens until everything happens all at once.On a side note, one good thing about Europe proper becoming islamic is that birthrates will increase once it becomes a caliphate. We’ve seen countries like Sicily &amp; Spain ruled by muslims for centuries &amp; the people were not extinguished, not even close. Islam will destroy liberalism &amp; with it the most extreme anti natal conditions that has brought the White man to near extinction. That’s what gives me hope for Europe, that &amp; they have countries named after their race unlike the vague universal identity of America that was deliberately designed to dissolve ethnic &amp; thus racial identity in favor of an idea.Whites can survive under the thumb of hostile racial aliens instituting islamic law but it has clearly been demonstrated that nobody on this planet can survive liberalism. Liberalism is the seed of entropy &amp; decay, its a term for a collection of self destructive ideas that healthy societies reject &amp; stamp out. If nothing else that should be the lesson we learn from this cycle.

                And yet they’re loyal to the system which has an iron grip over every institution &amp; doesn’t tolerate anything except absolute submission for access.The masses are leading us to extinction &amp; it remains to be seen as to whether a meaningful number of them will break off &amp; take out side. That &amp; whether it’ll be too late by the time that even occurs.Then there’s the fact they’re predisposed to utter degeneracy, somehow people in 1930 were able to bring jewish Hollywood to its knees &amp; force them to obey Christian culture. A a generation later people were having drug filled orgies, de-segregation at gun point carried out by the masses themselves on the orders of a hostile alien race &amp; the entire media complex lionized such behavior.We went from having zero tolerance for unmarried couple who weren’t married sleeping in the same bed in a movie to this. That’s dysgenics &amp; that places a hard cap on how many &amp; how far people will be willing to go to either fix this mess or resist continuing after the evil empire fades away. Take a look at Russia, they’re far more more intolerant than we are in the West &amp; yet they refuse to touch the race issue same as the Christian masses who deliberately interpret bible verses to justify their own extinction.Call me a cynic but I’m not getting my hopes up for maintaining territory, even balkanization seems like a pipe dream given how anti ethnocentric people are. Most of the people who want to split away idolize savages &amp; of course there jews will follow &amp; use their tribalism to ascend to positions of power assuming they’re not already dug in like ticks when such an event happens.Liberal democracy has effectively checkmated the vast majority of escape routes that still allow us to keep our ancestral lands rather than fleeing &amp; letting the masses to their fate.
