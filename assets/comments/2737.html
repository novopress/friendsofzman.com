        How long before one of our elected “betters” proposes a Muslim History month to educate the unwashed on the great Islamic contributions to American society?

        Great post Z man.
re: Gonwiththewind’s major religous charity groups bring in the immigrants.
How true. Also consider the Liberals in the Ivy league as seen in their magazines. My wife and I have Ivy degrees and get the alummni mags: story after story of bringing the blacks and browns to the USA seem to never end and have been published for decades.

        Two major religious charity groups are responsible for bringing most of the muslims to this country.  I’m not sure any NGO should be involved in this process but I am very sure they should pay the costs and not the taxpayers.  To just be angry about it doesn’t work we need to create a organization that would take these NGOs and their members to court.  Civil lawsuits is a good place to start.

        Remember this from July 28th of this year?“President Barack Obama: “In the United States…Eid also reminds us of the many achievements and contributions of Muslim Americans to building the very fabric of our nation and strengthening the core of our democracy.http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/29/obama-thanks-muslims-building-very-fabric-our-nati/Remember when the geniuses in our government bureaucracy sent out flight school approvalsfor two of the already dead hijackers just six months after 9/11?These agencies are un-fixable.There’s no consequences, or accountability in any of these absurd agencies &amp; departments. Filled with endless AA hires, pc dullards and angry gyno-Americans all pulling down 6 figures plus, plus bonuses and benefits. It has only gotten worse since 9/11.“The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has also been excoriated for several spectacular gaffs – most infamously, for sending notification to a Florida flight school that two of the hijackers had been approved as students six months after their deaths.(9/11) But there has been no comparable effort to examine the failures of our immigration system. For example, all of the September 11 hijackers were issued visas, but there have been no extensive congressional hearings or investigations by the General Accounting Office or the Office of the Inspector General to determine whether the State Department, which issued the visas, erred in any way.”http://cis.org/HowTerroristsGetIn

        Yesterday’s sorrowful speech by The One clearly demonstrated the truth of your claim that some people learned absolutely nothing from 9/11.  I am torn between the alternatives that Obama is either not bright enough to have learned anything from 9/11 or else he harbors such deep sympathies for the Islamic faith he cannot acknowledge its PROFESSED threat to Western Civilization.  I’m inclined to choose the latter and say he is a CINO, a Christian in Name Only.

        Your prescription is but what Roosevelt would have done. The NSA, Fatherland Security, and a few dozen alphabet agencies are in fact making it possible, temporarily,both to import and ignore trouble. Absent the omnipotent state they would never have been encouraged to come here, quite the contrary. And of course the omnipotent state also has the advantage of controlling other citizens which the state considers a far great threat. The State has not been shy about exclaiming who they are.
