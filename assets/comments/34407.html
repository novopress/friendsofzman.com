        I’ve been reading about this Dispensationalist heresy and it’s insane that so-called Christians believe, in a very Judaic way, that they have the power to compel Almighty God to commence the End Times and bring about the Second Coming of Christ.It’s from the same Judaic tradition that holds that if you surround a city in fishing line, God won’t notice that you’re breaking the Sabbath. The Jews in NYC are constantly having to make sure the line is kept intact or else they’ll be in trouble with God.Just a simple reading of scripture debunks all of Dispensationalism. But the worst thing is how it is motivating our leaders (see Tucker’s interview with the always awful Ted Cruz) to blindly support our best little friend in the Middle East, whom they consider God’s All Stars. That and a lot of AIPAC green and blackmail material.What these zealots don’t realize is that things happen on God’s timeline, not theirs. And the present state of Israel is not the same one in the Bible.I don’t care about Israel. Or Iran. I don’t want us involved in any way. It’s not our fight. Same with Ukraine, Syria, you name it. I’m just sick of good Southern boys dying in foreign hellholes to make some oligarchs slightly richer and for religious zealotry.

            You can speak for yourself, Tobbogan. As for me and my house, we’re learning to twirl fowl around our heads, litigate G_d, rhythmically lurch, complain, strike for an even better deal at Goldblatt’s and select the correctly hued heifer.
Our tv pastor wants us to be saved!

                Very well put. Hagee is one of the worst, along with Joel Osteen and his “prosperity gospel” that is horrendous heresy. Osteen has one of the most punchable faces I’ve ever seen.

                            Both are. Striking or willing to corrodes the soul, and its relationship with Good. Being unable to strike, while lusting to, corrodes the ego, and its will-to-power.

            Postmillennial Dispensationalism, yes. Even the Catholics officially accept Dispensationalism, i.e., that post-Christ, we have a dispensation; we no longer have to comply with Abrahamic and Mosaic Covenantal Law.

                    I didn’t know why it was called ‘Dispensational’, or about the High Church / Low Church distinction, or that aspect of Shia, so thanks.
Nixon, when asked, said the Shah was the most progressive leader in the Middle East. His mistake was…
Liberating the women. And sending the students overseas. The women immediately accused him of being too conservative, and, as Whiskey once predicted, demanded their own version of The Handmaid’s Tale and revolution. The students came back radicalized and demanded socialism.
Nixon said what both got, rather than some repression of Islamists, is total repression of everyone.

                        Liberating women is rapidly and inevitably followed by the degradation of men, which is followed by the criminalization of masculinity, as in America. At that point, non-elite males essentially are second-class citizens.
Sounds like Iranian men weren’t eager for that, and didn’t want the Empowered Ones taking away their educations, jobs, children, families and freedom.
The anglo nations, by compare, all were transformed into gynarchies rather promptly, while the men pretended it didn’t happen.  Or that it was wonderful and righteous, the Muh Princess option.

                            Upon getting “liberation”, about 1% of women actually do something productive that they couldn’t have done before and become mathematicians, scientists, writers, or one of the very few heads of state that isn’t a total corrupt jackass. The other 99% become whores chasing alhpa cock by night and doing meaningless “jobs” in corporations/government (same thing really) by day. In fact, I’d say that the modern merger of corporation and state has been made possible by women acting as the “glue” that fuses both into a totalitarian whole. As many have noted – personnel is policy.The totalitarian framework of “liberal” democracy can only be broken by sending the women home, or at least throwing them out of government and corporations. Most modern women are probably too insane to attract a husband and form a healthy family but perhaps we could just admit the reality of their nature and legalize prostitution. They would have a way to support themselves at least without destroying civilization.

                                Wow great post. I agree with all your points. Yes, there is a small percentage of females capable of making contributions to society (aside from motherhood) equal to, or greater, than the contributions of men.I have no issue with their inclusion, provided they are always supervised by men. Strong and based men.‘I’d say that the modern merger of corporation and state has been made possible by women acting as the “glue” that fuses both into a totalitarian whole’Astute observation and I believe that you are correct.‘The totalitarian framework of “liberal” democracy can only be broken by sending the women home, or at least throwing them out of government and corporations’So very true.  That is why on this page and elsewhere I tell folks that continuing Western feminism/gynarchy is a civilizational dead end, and that they must choose between empowered daughters, or life.Women also must not be allowed to teach without immediate male supervision, as they have brainwashed past generations to suit their preferred ideology (which is themselves).I am a realist when it comes to male and female sexual urges. However, I’d quibble on the prostitution element and suggest a more family-oriented structure instead. This, of course, would require razing the gynarchy and its servant legal system and ‘laws’ like VAWA.Thanks for the great response.

                        “High Church / Low Church”
Most people misuse this distinction, too. The separation happened between Luther and Zwingli. Luther believed the church was allowed to make creedal anything the Bible did not proscribe, while Zwingli argued it should include in the faith only those things the Bible mandated.
Usually, the easiest way to distinguish between them is whether they have a liturgy or recite one of the creeds at services. Since these are not required in the Bible, those would be “High Church”.

                        Dispensationalist theology holds that there are different strokes for different folks as long as those folks are Jews; they are still the Chosen and their covenant is still valid, for them. Supersessionist theology, which most of the rest of Christianity including Catholicism adheres to, defines only one covenant and one chosen people: Christ’s, and Christians.

                            That’s not even the Cliff’s Notes version. Dispensationalism is just the idea that the various Covenants only applied to people in certain timeframes. Edenic Covenant was pre-apple, so applied only to Adam and Eve. It was basically Be Fruitful and Multiply, which somehow they messed up.
Adamic Covenant was the whole life of pain thing. Still applies.
Noahic Covenant was God won’t flood the world again. Also still applies.
Whenever the Covenants change, the Dispensation changes.

                                You fundamentally misunderstand both schools of thought or you’re playing word games. “Uhhhh you believe in two covenants which means you believe in dispensations, checkmate!” isn’t some kind of gotcha, it’s irrelevant semantics. Dispensationalists themselves disagree as to how many of these chapters to distinguish and whether each corresponds to a different dispensation. The key irreconcilable differences are in the view that there is still any valid pact between God and the Jews, and that He has got a separate plan and destiny for them apart from that of Christians, compounded with an additionally wackadoo interpretation of End Times prophecies that most of the rest of Christianity also rejects.

                        Exactly! Though as Shotgun points out, there is quite a little disagreement as to how many “dispensations” there have been. I’ve personally met sects who can rationally justify 13, and the 14th is the coming Christ’s Kingdom. How do they know we are living in the last one? Faith, I guess.

                    For those questioning dispensations in Catholicism, ask your priest about Papal Dispensations. Those are relaxations from (IIRC) Doctrinal Law (but not Divine Law) which the Pope grants. There’s a word for it that escapes me, but it’s closely tied to subsidiarity. Jesus granted a Divine Dispensation from the Age of Law, in a parallel manner, the Pope grants Dispensations to lesser Law, and each step down in the hierarchy has the authority to grant dispensations from even lesser law.
Darby decided to use the word itself from Catholicism to make it easier to understand.

                    Not really. They believe, as any Christian does, that we are living in the Dispensation of the new rules that Christ brought. into being. The sects squabble about what exactly the new rules are, sure, but we all agree that we live in the Gospel Dispensation, or whatever variant name a given sect uses.
I don’t know much about Mormonism, but from what I understand, they think there are a new subset of rules and promises revealed in those plates John Smith found, so they would likely be yet another dispensation.

            Dispensationalism, invented by John Nelson Darby between 1828-1830, has corrupted the belief of 70% of protestants by some estimates. The apostle Paul first warned against pastors teaching “Jewish fables” back in the first century (Titus 1:14). Dispensationalism essentially takes Jesus’ prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple which occurred in the year 70 A.D., misinterprets much of the symbolic language of the Olivet Discourse and Revelation, and claims events long past are yet in our future 1950+ years later.

                “invented by John Nelson Darby”
Invented by Darby, no. Systematized by Darby, yes.
Preterists mostly believe the collapse of the temple in 70 AD is what He is talking about in Matthew 24. Full Preterists also have no problems with the Olivet Discourses. Partial Preterists may or may not — there are all kinds of opinions about which prophesies have been fulfilled.
I get that you probably have only Catechism to rely on, and Catholics tend to portray dissident thought in an extremely negative light, but I would think someone worthy of the name dissident…

                I sure hope not, and not because I don’t loathe Israelis. The transnational Jews we have infesting America and Western Europe are WAY WAY WAY worse than nationalist Israelis.Jewish civilizational builders, flaws and all, went to Israel to build their civilization. The transnational predators slinked back back into Paris and London after WW2, and returned to their pastime of subverting and raping European civilization. If Israel falls, the nationalist Jews are going to end up mostly in America where they will quickly readapt into becoming transnationalist predators.The difference between them and those who have been feeding at America’s jugular for the last century, is that their goy hatred will be amplified by their (correctly) perceived loss of sovereignty, and they will go gangbusters getting it back by putting serf collars around our necks. I see the totalitarian evil of Karp’s Palantir in the context of my certainty in the manifestation of this process.

                    Israel is the Australia of Judaism.In America, the old-money German Jews from the Revolutionary War (who lived in Manhatten and voted Republican) didn’t want the grubby immigrant Russian shtetl-dwellers from Brooklyn (who voted Democrat) to mob their ritzy golf clubs.In Europe, the old-money industrialist oligarchs of both Germany and Britain, many of whom were Jewish, same as here, didn’t want those immigrant radicals from Russia and Poland such as the KDP German Communist Party and the Rotfront (Red Front). Antifa was pulling their usual tricks of trying to turn Bavaria into a Communist oblast (1918) and of violent street riot “protests” (where their snipers would shoot the police.)Britain wanted a colonial outpost in the crossroads of the Mideast, so they could access oil for her Majesty’s Navy. Israel is ideally situated – as it was in ancient times – and the elites wanted to get rid of a lot of trash, i.e., the superstitious underclass, the criminal gangs, and the anarchists.The mobsters were offered the job of setting up the colony. Note that countries afflicted with jihadis or Cartel do the same today – they pay their problems to go somewhere else, like conquistadors. Irgun, Hagana, and Shin Bet would deal with the inevitable resistance by the locals.The governments of Britain and Germany both cooperated in the Havarra Transfer Program, even during the war that the industrialist oligarchs funded. (Apparently other governments joined in, such as France, as the French Resistance was composed largely of Communist gangs.)The idea of settling a scrub-brush territory surrounded by hostile tribes under the Mob’s thumb was not very appealing to people raised in Europe; Germany only got about 150,000 ‘volunteers’, Britain about 45,000. They were promised they’d get to keep their money, but only if they moved.To that was added the fuel of Eastern Europe’s own inclinations, molded as they were by their harsh history. The rabbi’s messianic exhortations were supplemented by pogroms (rich Jews collaberating with the gangs and authorities, as had been most pogroms in Russia), and atrocity propaganda to further enthuse the lackluster participants (no shortage of that in Jewish culture).The founding mythology of Israel was thus formed, providing the rich spice that flavors our kosher-approved foods today.

        Hey Z. You made the point several times that at some point the Cloud people will be affected by the invasion and get some smelling salts.

Looks like Sarcone found out. Some may still be awake enough to realize that this could be random, or, like Mexico or other cartel countries, this guy could be paid by someone to do this. Was it random, or was he Sheinbaum’d?
The Clouds have invited the darkness upon themselves.
Yet, we are likely on our own. I think the 2025 corollary to Nixon’s aphorism is:
We Are All Laken Reilly Now.

                Yes. It happened to Elon’s buddy in SF at his apartment building in ’23. Likely prompted him to do what he did to back Trump.

                    The idea of Elon learning, realizing, or understanding anything is preposterous—like thinking Koko could talk—but it’s fun to imagine. He should be afraid ofeverybody.
All the “tech bros” should be terrified to make any public appearance under any circumstance. Some seem to show it, not a man’s guilty knowledge—”For what I’ve done and want to do, Ishouldbe killed”—but an animalistic knowing that they have toget usbefore we (realize we should)get them.
They may have achieved sentience.

                            I sort of disagree. Some .380s are so compact they have vicious recoil even though the cartridge is considered on the weaker side. I passed on an AMT Backup a guy offered me for sale many years ago for that reason.It all depends on the circumstances. If she’s in a force-on-force running gunfight with a dude with a .40, she’s outgunned. But that’s extremely rare to say the least. On the other hand, if some guy is trying to rape her and she manages to pull a .22 and shove it under his chin and pull the trigger, it’ll be plenty.

                                I’ve got a little .22 derringer that I can only get just under 2 fingers on the grip, and, yea, controlling muzzle rise is a bitty. The LCP, though, is probably fine. My wife carries that in 9, and she’s not very big.
It’s all about shot placement, though. I’ve put cattle down with a .22.

        Great observation that the US is now substantially populated by geezers and foreigners – and the tards in DC apparently have yet to get the memo.  The age of the government here blustering and threatening everyone else on the planet is fading fast.  Who are they going to back up the threats, lol?  This place is rapidly becoming a joke – actually it already is…

            Yep. D.C. in particular is like an older Boomer or Silent still going on about the marvel of CD’s. They don’t live in reality or understand it although they believe they are well-informed with secret knowledge. Everyone in that city is an Israel Firster, and even many Israelis have severe doubt about their country. The citizenry outside the District is clueless, too, but not to that degree.

Exactly.  Christianity is impotent because rotten with prog/feminist assumptions and persons . . . and weak men who seek to be ‘leaders of churches’.  It is utterly devoid of the real and living power of Christ — who is the summa of masculinity — and without Christ it becomes merely a cult of ianity.  Play some guitars and welcome the new pastoress.

            Christianity’s capitulation is of a piece with the surrender of the West. The very people who convinced us that whites are the cancer of the human race also conquered the Christian clericy and used it as a vehicle to further deligitimate the West and sow its destruction from within. There’s no difference between an archbishop and a provost.

        This whole episode did have a WWE-Royal Rumble vibe. The sponsor was Flomax (a prostate medication). Bibi – 75, Trump – 79 and Ayatollah – 86; a bunch of geezers settling old scores. Makes me feel young. The younger people over there in the ME will have to decide whether to chill out or build robot armies to kill each other. The only benefit to falling Testosterone levels world-wide and plastic filling our b*lls is that it may chill out the younger people and we may all be able to die in peace, or at least until immigrant savages kill us as God intended.

        Yes.  This whole thing looked like poorly executed Kabuki Theater.  Witkoff almost made a deal with Iran by accident.  Then Trump and Israel scuttled it with crazy talk.
Then, $billions of missiles later, they just called it off.
Iran’s uranium is now missing, they’ll accept an alliance with Russia next time it’s offered, and the NPT is dead.  But we won!

            It seems like Israel was genuinely surprised and alarmed at the amount of power Iran brought to the table and what they were doing to Tel Aviv, Haifa, etc. It’s also weird that Trump is declaring total victory and that Iran’s nuclear problem is “obliterated”, even though there is no evidence of that and even they admit they don’t know where the uranium is. But, I suppose they have no choice.This morning I woke up and saw Trump going off on Israel for breaking the cease-fire. To that I say, of course they did, they’ve done it every time, but it is interesting that most of his ire is directed at them. It’s clear that he is tired of these perfidious scumbags that are keeping him from doing what he wants but also has to deal with them.

Netanyahu started the damned thing, when he Pearl-Harbor’ed the Iranians on Friday June 13th [“Operation Rising Lion”].
“Rising Lion“, my ass.

We still don’t know whether Trump approved “Rising Lion” beforehand, or whether Netanyahu simply stabbed Trump in the back [without bothering to inform Trump about Rising Lion].

                    There were reports a couple of weeks ago that Trump put the kibosh on Bibi’s attack plans while the U.S. conducted negotiations.
So it’s very possible that Bibi double-crossed Trump and boxed him into a corner where he felt he had to bomb Iran, and now he’s trying to cover his own ass with bullshit about what a great victory and cease-fire he won, but the Jews keep jerking him around.

                    Talk is cheap, as has been said.  Israel is a vicious dog on an American leash. Trump needs to stop refueling the Israeli war machine.  Only that will getNetanyahu’sattention and complete cooperation. “F-bombs” won’t do it.  Trump will never have more power/control over Israel than he does today.  The country and people of Israel are exhausted financially and militarily.

                Yes, but it’s also very confusing. One day we think Trump is being tossed scraps of moldy gefiltefish in Bibi’s dungeon, then the next he’s in front of the cameras hitting Bibi’s brigades with a verbal smackdown. Look, Tradissidents are clued into reality more than anybody else, but we gotta admit that much of what we believe is indeterminate conjecture.

        After having binge-read hundreds [???] of pages about recent events concerning missiles, I can’t help but sense that the Oligarchs have decided to move away from classical kinetic warfare, in favor of a bizarre Psy-Op driven pseudo-warfare, in which psychological wins trump classical kinetic wins.And if fake [often non-existent] attacks on military facilities can make a big enough splash in the (((Media))), then the fake attacks appear to be producing a more powerful shared dopamine hit [amongst the populace] than would actual successful kinetic attacks.How addicted is the populace to the Dopamine Hits?Might the Dopamine Hits become more real [amongst the middle of the bull curve of the populace] than is Reality itself?

            This is what happens when you have a ruling class of people who believe in sorcery and magic and believe that their words are magic incantations that conjure reality. Israel’s propaganda campaign after the events of 10/7/2023 failed spectacularly – remember the forty beheaded babies! – but I think worked extremely well this time around. I was shocked at how fast so many normies got on board and were cheering for Israel and claiming the Ayotallah was the new moustache man. I think you’re right, a lot of these normies were desperate for something to cheer for as Trump’s domestic policies have been relatively slow to fall in place.

            Before 2022 there was endless gibbering about 3rd and 4th generation warfare because war was obsolete or something.  War is not obsolete. It’s peace that is unnatural and obsolete. Propaganda/narratives does not win wars.  It might be a great dopamine hit to the leadership, but that’s all it is. It does nothing to win the war.

                Zelensky has been fighting a postmodern war since the beginning. It’s all narrative for western consumption. When he needs more funding he approves some terrorist attack that can get discussed for a few days on CNN and Fox News. Then he goes back to losing soldiers, battles, and territory to Russia. I bet if you ask most people in the west they would think Ukraine is winning. Of course you make a good point, the fact that he can do this means he doesn’t have to end the war. He doesn’t have to sue for peace because nobody is going to back a losing horse anymore. It can go on indefinitely.

George Washington was 44 in 1776 and was considered a senior member of the revolution. Of course, there were older man — Franklin was 70 at the time, but most of the movers and shakers were what we consider today to be in the prime of their lives — 30s and 40s. Even Caesar Rodney, who is frequently portrayed as a frail old man, and was dying of cancer, was only 48 when he signed the declaration.

            We need to be less White. I personally would accept a harem, the Yamnaya did!  Actually, in ye good olde days, Americans often had broods of 7-15.
A little more /r, a lot less K/!Then we can outrun the Africans and Bangladeshis.
Why did Japan stop breeding? With the advent of Western corporate capitalism, the sararimen are just plain exhaused. Even the women are expected to work late daily. Nobody, especially not the bosses, gets off at 5.
The problem of overtime is so widespread people have to hire “resignation agents”, because they aren’t allowed to quit.

                They, as with most peoples, were promised a better life through use of their talents and hard work.Lies. Once they understood no material generational improvements would be bestowed unto them, they quietly quit. Resistance was accorded stigma and harsh legal treatment. In some aspects, they are worse off. And so with the destruction of close bonds people stopped breeding.

        … too old or too disinterested to get into it.
Pretty much.  I wish it would all just go away;  It is so damn pointless, this thirty five years of endless bombing of fly-blown sand holes while we import their worthless populations into our country to crap-up our neighborhoods.
Folks ask me what I think of the affair, and all I can muster is “What a sh*t show.”

        These latest happenings, w/r/t Russia and Iran, all do have a “Remember when we rocked?! Guess what…we’re still touring, and we’re coming to your city this summer!” vibe to it…like the company that manages Chicago or Blood Sweat &amp; Tears needs some hype and cash and they compel their legacy pop acts to do a few dates, and nobody under 50 cares nor knows who Chuck Mangione is. But there are a lot of Boomers and they tend to have money, so these acts will carry on until Bob and Bill can’t walk into a venue without medical devices.I see it as a white pill that even after all these schemes to start wars with people the Boomers are told to dislike, by aged and experienced men with money, nothing really happens. This is the very definition of impotent rage. They want us all to love and appreciate Chicago but fail to realize that nobody wants horns or strings in music anymore.

                I’m a fan of Chicago – well, 1970s Chicago. I like all the stuff with guitars and horns. We’ll never get there again, musically. And I say this as a Carter baby, not a Boomer.
But it’s okay to have your musical or artistic (or even sartorial) tastes stuck in another time. But intellectually you should always be evolving.

                            Could be stylistic or it could be cost.  You cannot play copyrighted music in public. Remember when the Recording jews of America went after the girlscouts for doing the macarina?  So they have to pay to do the covers.Also, why not ELO.  I think ELO is closer to their style than BS&amp;T.  Even Spinning Wheel, a big hit for them has a harder edge than anything Chicago did, at least in the 70s and 80s. But ELO is a much softer sounding music in an at least related style.  ELO is one of my favorites.They did do a Carpenters cover.  Though she (the Russian chick, who I hear is a big star in China) can sing pretty well, Karen was in a league of her own, at least in her own style.  It sounds good, but it’s hard to compare it to the original.  They Carpenters did a cover of Jambalaya by Hank Williams (a great song) and totally carpenterized it. That is why I mean by her style.

                Well, Iwasborn during the Baby Boom (but am not a “Boomer” if that refers to a certain political mindset represented by Fox News or the Democrat establishment) and I never liked Chicago or BS&amp;T.

        A marvelous and unique article, Z-Man. In a serious nation, it would lead the Op-Ed section in the “paper of record.”
As an aside, I get the same sense of Iran that you do. The Iran of 2025 is a far cry from the Iran of 1985, and far less dangerous. A nuclear-armed Iran in 1985 would have been a truly frightening thing. If you proved to me Iran had nukes right now, I’d yawn in your face.

            Me, too, but that would be because the past few months would be evidence that this level of provocation would not cause the nukes to fly. It’s why I don’t feel particularly nervous about Israel having nukes, either. Despite their 10/7 being much bigger event  per capita than our 9/11, when other nations piled on with longer range missiles, they kept it conventional.
It’s not popular to look on the positive Re: Israel, I know, but they are not the loose cannons many seem to fear, Samson Option on a hair trigger.

                The Sampson Option seems contradictory, or against self interest.  Imagine nuking “friendly” countries because they don’t come to your aid when invaded.  Perhaps *the* sure fire way to end any hope of survival and refuge for your citizens.

                Israel probably knew 10/7 was coming but regardless, killing 40,000 Gazans, many of them children, is no sign of restraint on their part .   There was zero chance they were ever going to nuke someone after 10/7 .

            The diaspora Iranians are excited and hopeful, they feel the grip of the Regime slipping.  We forget that Shahs are a tradition going back to Cyrus.  Even though the right insists on repeating Leftist tropes, Mossadegh and the Ayatollahs were the color revolutions.Thus the insistance on democracy, so criminals can bloc vote themselves into power.(Hint: the king protects his people and nationfrom the government.)I don’t see Israel openly fielding foreign militias to colonize other countries, or blocking the steets with noon prayer outside the mosques, or running brazen grooming gangs.  They keep their crime quieter, bad enough as their proxies are, since it is a political tool.

                Addendum (unable to edit):Why would I give a fig about some foreign country?
Because it weakens Israel’s hand in our country.
It’s a clear sign that the neocon policy reigning since 1963 can be reversed, and that the Noticing is becoming a common trope.
Let the sabotage be seen, let our enemies defeat each other and themselves.Might the messianic vision of catasrophe all Abrahamics teach go back to the wasteland – they are impelled to try to recreate the environment that created them.

        ‘ . . . United States is no longer a nation of people who optimistically look to the future. It is a land of old people and foreigners who fear what may lie ahead’Didn’t have children.  Had feminism instead.  Strutting, empowered, don’t-need-no man feminism.  Indeed, the openly expressed goal of the Sixties feminists was destruction of the family and alienation of the fathers.  They succeeded, almost without any fight whatsoever.That leaves a nation of spoiled-brat oldsters who must import Julio and Ngbuga to empty their bedpans and trim the hedges.  Even as you say, they have money but live in fear.Few weeks back my buddy invited me to his son’s third birthday party. I was one old white dood in a sea of brown.  He rented a bouncy castle for the numerous little ones.  The whole front yard was full of happy, squealing kids, surrounded by generally poor but content elders.I left halfway through, tired, and as my buddy helped me to the car, a girl of about nine — some relative of somebody — hugged me and kissed me on the cheek.Sucks to be you.

                                Compsci sez even tho whites can’t replace themselves (hmm why might that be?), it doesn’t mean they are childless! Dammit!I guess he’s saying because the feminist generations produced a few kids here and there, shut up. Hey, Kids are kids all over he sez! Dunno what eggzakly that pertains to, but moving on.I’m saying the problem of barren generations is empowered women and neutered men, and he says there is no problem because look, some of us here have kids. Oh and p.s. don’t get snarky about it, because out of place.I think it’s v much in place.

                                Angelina Jolie is prime example and representative of the cluster B personality disorder evident in “modern” females. She is head rat of the unstable single mothers who harm their children and poison their relationships with their estranged fathers. These children, raised by such mothers, face end up whackier than the mother. Recently, Brad Pitt appeared on a podcast, reflecting calmly and introspectively life and past experiences in his sixties, but his ex-wife just couldn’t keep her mouth shut and had to throw her poison vomit on this innocuous reflection. Life without ‘em may not have the possibility of being as rich but if you avoid them you’ll benefit from the calm.

                            My maternal grandparents had seven kids, that’s what it took to run a farm in south dakota.  NOBODY was ‘liberated’ back then; everybody was oppressed by life.
Back in those days, most everybody had extended families, usually living in the same town or at least county.
Now?  Most of the extended families are Messican, and nuclear families are dying as well.  However, we DO have lots and lots of feminism and empowered females.  Who often kill what children appear.

                        Plus homeschooling. And it was the same way it always was in the past — the older siblings had to grow up fast and help take care of their little brothers and sisters.
It really is inspiring.. They have been a model to others in their community.

                I count on the fact that people here have children and grandchildren. Also that many men here have daughters and grand-daughters.  To them I especially speak.
Sucks to be you means your nation — and many of you — chose poorly and now must face old age without grandchildren. But it was, and is, a choice. I am pointing out the consequences of that choice. If it bothers you, tough.

                    As I suggested just a moment ago in my reply to Ostei, it wasn’t my choice.  Nor was it a choice for many of my contemporaries.
As she would often say, “This isn’t something where you get to choose.  You’ll just have to live with it.”

                        I wasn’t clear.  I was not saying that childlessness was the choice, but the promotion and encouragement of feminism, liberated women, and second-class citizenship men was the errant choice.  And a choice made again and again over five decades.While their country was being taken over by empowered girls and women, men on the Right overwhelmingly either were complicit, or silently tolerant. THAT is the choice the doomed the birthrate, and the nation.What resulted from that choice was an inability of the rest of us to have wives not empowered and weaponized against us, and children that would not be stolen from us by Team Woman and her State.

                            Well, I was neither silent nor tolerant but all it got me was a no-fault divorce (which she justified as a “liberating” response to my traditionalist attitudes).
You seem to be under the mistaken impression that men on the right had much “agency” in these situations, which tells me that you probably didn’t live through it yourself.

                                I lived through false accusation on multiple occasions, and false arrest and imprisonment on one occasion.  I lived through plenty.I am not under the impression such men had agency vis a vis females and their collective power.  I am saying that many millions of Rightie men — many with daughters who would greatly benefit from institutional feminism — either embraced and furthered the gynarchy, or stood silent while women took over everything.ALL of us had the agency over the past 4 decades to speak up and out about what was going on.  Only a tiny percentage of Rightie men availed themselves of that opportunity, which is tantamount to brotherly betrayal.I cannot explain it any simpler than that and I am done with this thread.

Yes, This is why I have been saying that the West is as much an ideological communist society as the USSR was. What is different is that it’s not industrial/proletarian communism… it’s race and gender communism.

                Indeed. Just as Yuri Bezmenov noted.
The USSR ended up conquering us, it just happened to be dead when it was accomplished. And it was done via sex/gender and race — the core of Identity Politics or Progressivism.  Even as you said.

            Of course, this misses the key element of Feminism – it wasn’t like White women spontaneously thought this one up on their own.
In fact, I just heard a faded interview with a British centenarian describing the Victorian age she had grown up in: “Pfah!  Women didn’t work in those days!”

                Well you’re right about white women — or women generally — not thinking up rebellion against God and man on their own.
They had help, and powerful help it was, going right on back to the beginning.  Scripture covers it in Genesis.  We are still fighting the same fight all these millennia later.

            Yup. Iran may be Country #6, but the Clean Break people are already crowing about Turkey and Pakistan. Sisi in Egypt watches them with the gimlet eye.
I say good. Turkey and Pakistan’s armies are way too big. Saddam’s was, unfortunately a jobs program, and Iran has way too many missiles for peaceful protesting. Plus, the front lines are where all these guys get rid of their dissidents.
Ok, Israel. We pay you a lot of money – now do your damn job, start disrupting, and stop pushing them into Europe, or we’ll cast you into the fires you set.

        What i saw militarily is America has air power, and thats about it.
Excluding some small competent special forces America probably has little ability to project force on the ground nor would the American people tolerate human losses.
The scum in DC and Fox News like Mark Levin would cheer but not the people if large sacrifices on the ground were required.
We had better hope the stealth technology stays ahead of the Air Defense technology.
But perhaps nations like Iran will succomb to moderninity and be sharing pride month celebrations with Tel Aviv and New York.

                As I’ve noted on this site previously, ‘Jewish’ women were vastly overrepresented in early Twentieth-Century feminism. . . like rogue Quaker women back when the feminist movement began. After the19th, Jewish females often were movers and shakers.My personal fave back then was Hella Assbug, er I mean Bella Abzug, an odious and crisply toxic presence who softened her Inner Fuhrer look with gaily festooned hats. You know, like the festive scarves of Debbie ‘Plague Darlin’ Birx.&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=9a5e20efe6d2462b422e81bddabdd2123f8bbe7fa57a778fdfcb4ed3dd27e7d8Ah, ring me back the years . . .  anyway, women writers on ‘conservative outlets’ (looking at you gateway pundit) waxing deific about Darlin’ Debby, how she stood Tall next to Foolja Fauci, how she projected the confidence of female leadership and the empowerment of blah blah etc.I did not read any retraction articles when the truth about Little Debbie came out. Nor any prosecutions of team titan, Fauci and Birx. That encourages further criminal activity in the name of Helping People.

        By bombing the nuke sites, and then hearing the chorus immediately begin to sign “regime change”, Trump proved that it was never about the nukes.It was always about re-igniting the land war in Asia.And then he came out today and F-bombed Netanyahu and in a few words encapsulated what so many people think and feel, “They’ve been fighting so long, they don’t know what the f$$k they are doing!”  Then he look led at the shill reporter and yelled, “Do you understand, now?”People like me were worried that Israel had taken control of Trump.  He thumped them today in a way that will ripple for many years.I’ve come full circle and am back to believing Trump wants an Israel/Iran version of the Israel/Egypt peace treaty.  His goal?  To foreclose on war in that region not just for his presidency, but for generations.

        Since we’re conditioned to accept defeat and the framing of the Left, we begrudge according a victory to anyone on our side.Here’s the Treehouse’s take on what many are calling the kayfabe.Bibi, that snake, set a trap and Trump deftly sidestepped it.Even though we doubt everything we see and hear – the surrender conditioning is working – the latest kicked off when the IAEA announced Iran had exceeded enrichment guidelines.  The militaries accept the idea that what we call fake is real – that’s their job, after all – and responded accordingly.Sundance’s take:President Trump Outwitted Benjamin Netanyahu – The “12 Day War” is Over!President Trump didn’t want to escalate with Iran. Netanyahu forced President Trump into a supportive box with attacks against Iran. President Trump responded with a public hug to Bibi and eventually a U.S. bombing of the Iran nuclear sites.﻿Israel was big happy.However, Trump’s emissary Steve Witkoffnever stopped communicatingwith Iran on peace approach, and negotiated/coordinated a face-saving Iranian retaliation via a happy to oblige Qatar.Iran retaliated against the USA support for Israel with a pre-planned attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, which was easily managed. Iran saves face against evil Trump.(Easy Peasy – Iran Retaliates With Missiles Targeting Previously Evacuated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, then declares ceasefire at 3:59 a.m. to abide by the agreement.)Meanwhile, loyal friend to Israel, Trump has facilitated the request of Bibi.Diplomacy now returns sans operational nuclear sites. No regime change.Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israeli lobbyist Mark Levin are furious.

            Taking the most positive spin on this possible; If Trump does walk away from the Twelve Day War, it would be a great blueprint for walking away from the Three And A Half Years War.  Leave the fools to keep shooting at each other since “they don’t know what the f**k they are doing”, and mind our own affairs at home.
I mean good golly, there is practically a shooting war in LA between ICE and the Peasant Army.  Work on that [and no cease-fire on that one, please].

        “The cause of the war, of course, was the sneak attack by Israel” . . . so, nothing at all about Iranian behavior, all the terror-promoting Death to Israel and Death America stuff since 1979?  Not to mention the of course completely peaceful uranium processing.
“Israel is a tiny country, while Iran is a big country, so any war between the two will be lopsided.” As if population and land mass are the only determinants in a war, nothing about technology and character of the combatants. Seems perhaps a bit reductive.

            Countries are never truly defeated until they are occupied and controlled by a new population.  It may take time, but as was shown by the British occupation of India—the British, after an occupation of 100 years or so, were eventually defeated/ousted and left India to the Indians.  This is how I see the situation wrt to Israel vs Iran—Israel can never hope to control such a country as Iran.  It also takes into the account that in some respects, Iran is an older civilization/people than perhaps Israel.  They’ve succeeded in fending off destruction for millennia.Ironically, and tragically, my observation also applies to the country I was born in—the United States.  Here, however, we (White founders) *are* being replaced by a new population (Brown muds).  If/when such is accomplished the country will continue to exist in name only, but can never be what it once was.

                I know you aren’t in quite the same camp as many here, but most would point out it doesn’t really require occupation, but merely corruption of the youth, which, again based on commentariat, happens in as little as a single generation.

                Nobody will make it past the shield wall of the Zagros Mountains. Even though their armies, surprisingly, are about the same size – a bit over 400,000 each – they’d have to cross the Arab lands first.That’s why they resorted to an extensive spy network in Iran, killing the mob bosses, and used HST to clear Syrian air defenses.It’s about taking out the regime – the Islamist Lenin they put in to keep Iran from being a better free country than they were went rogue and started attacking them (by their lights) in Beirut in 1982.They’re trying to clean up the mess they helped make in ’79, with Jimmah and Bush acting at AIPAC’s direction. It started when Kissinger advised the Shah to quadruple the oil price per barrel in ’72-3 from 25 cents to $1, hoping to get a cut of that OPEC action with the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline to Iran.  This is old men rehashing their youth.

            “…all the terror-promoting Death to Israel and Death America stuff since 1979?”That’s a long time and kind of invalidates your point. I can live with Iranian mullahs screaming death to America for 45 years, I can’t live with more American soldiers coming home missing limbs, burnt beyond recognition, in coffins, or suffering PTSD while thrown out in the streets like trash, and all for nothing as these ancient conflicts never end and most of all, they really don’t want them to end. It’s what they live for but want us to die for.The character of the combatants is the same: Blood thirsty Desert-religion, sexually sadistic nutjobs.

                    Part of the “disengagement” or perhaps most, is that these wars of regime change were failures.  The concept was a failure to begin with and showed a profound misunderstanding of human nature.  Therefore, all the lives wasted and ruined, i.e., their sacrifice comes to naught.  Note that no one decries WWII and the almost 500k killed in the same vane.  The public (dirt people) that suffered the most have caught wise.

            “character of the combatants”
Like the IDF soldiers that relish in raping prisoners?  Or sniping pregnant women for the old two for one? That kind of character?
I love how you dolts think saying ‘death to america’ is grounds for war.  It’s always back to 1979.  Lets go back to 1953 if you want to play that game.  Genuinely I can’t get over how horrible your propaganda has become.  You assume you have a captured audience of Fox News watching geriatrics with room temperature IQ’s.

            Well, it gets awfully boring watching European diplomats and aid workers enrich themselves with fancy jobs and digs, while they pretend to do something. The interminable talks have done nothing to slow the aggression – nobody is calling Iran a colonizer – and actually reward the mafiosi who took over.They could be making their famous Persian wines, or fabrics, but nah. Who are we to say they can’t make missiles and pay Hezbollah to occupy Lebanon?! Or a nuclear program that we own the patents on? That’s Islamic capitalism!Besides, it gave Bibi a chance to stab his benefactor in the back, and slap those Evangelical Christians in the face.
