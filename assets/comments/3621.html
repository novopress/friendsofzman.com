        “Events simply don’t fall so neatly into their categories, which leaves room for all sides to claim they support their side.” Are “they” and “their” not the same? By rules of grammatical construction, “all sides” support “their side.” Your secondary phrase “which-side” has no place for “Events.” Good lord. I agree with much of what you say and will defend your right to sometimes piss me off, but for the sake of my blood pressure, please check out of gender correct writing. Oh, and then – “…if the state requires you and I…” The state requires I?

        This flak with the Pope would not have garnered so much attention if it were not for the Moslems doing what they do to avenge their centuries dead “prophet”. This particular Pope has said quite a few things over his tenure that many view as Leftist positions, so his comments on the limits of free speech certainly seem to be in keeping with current Leftist positions on same. Leftists always talk a good game on the merits of free speech but they’re really just referring to the speech they agree with.

        As a 71 year old life long conservative I like the concept of a public accommodation actually being open to the entire pubic.  It doesn’t seem contrary to rights of free speech and association.  I believe that what happened with the Christian baker and the gay coule was something different then what was presented publicly.  I believe that they asked for the wedding cake but also asked for a provocative statement iced onto the cake and that was the issue not the cake or their gayness.  If this issue had been treated honestly I think most people would agree that no one should be forced to write or say something provocative if it is against their will.  I doubt a black baker would be forced to make a cake for a KKK clan meeting with a provocative phrase iced onto the top.  And, ironically, recently a gay baker was asked to make a cake with a provocative anti-gay message on it.  They refused and somehow this event is not news worthy.   The speech is free and should be free but forcing others to speak against their views and beliefs shouldn’t be conflated with free speech.

            It’s why the state should have no role in private association. People can and do work these things out for themselves. I would not solicit a restaurant that refused to serve blacks. I suspect 90% of Americans would have the same attitude. That restaurant would therefore have a very small clientele from which to make a profit.There’s simply no way to let the state regulate some private associations and not others. The principle that says the state can force the baker to make cakes for people he finds abhorrent is the same that forces the Klansman to open his diner to blacks and Jews and Catholics. It’s also the same principle that lets the state force the church to pay for abortions.
