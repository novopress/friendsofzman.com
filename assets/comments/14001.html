        One other point: this is an almost perfect example of the modern progressive push toward “diversity,” and what it illustrates is, once again, that progressives lie in the most spectacular fashion imaginable. What they really mean by “diversity” is simply that everyone, no matter his origin, race, sex, shoe size, is to be assimilated. Everyone must think, speak, and act alike. Why else should anyone care whether or not blacks or women ride bicycles enough? Why else have a “commissioner” for something as trivial as this? Whenever you hear calls for “diversity,” just be aware that progressives are social and political omnivores, and you’re all on their menu.

            MtnExile: “What they really mean by “diversity” is simply that everyone, no matter his origin, race, sex, shoe size, is to be assimilated. Everyone must think, speak, and act alike.”Well said and thought.If everyone is not forced to act alike, then people will start noticing/wondering why certain groups aren’t acting alike.   Some groups will be noticed to be physically lazy, uncultured, or dumb, if they’re not doing exactly what others are doing.  Can’t have differences sprouting up.  Better get a commissioner assigned to it ASAP.Side note.  Years ago I asked on a forum what we as a society could do to get more black people interested in the great outdoors, camping &amp; hiking.   One of the responses: “fried chicken trees”.

                re: “what we as a society could do to get more black people interested in the great outdoors?”It’s an IQ thing. Blacks with a mean IQ of less than 80 and Mestizos less than 85 don’t have the mental horse power to appreciate the wonders of nature.When I was a youth I was involved in Amateur Astronomy &amp; Telescope making and also in Amateur Radio where I encountered adults of all ages, many as mentors. Never saw a Black then and the Mexican invasion had not started as it was in the 1950s. Currently I am in my mid 70s and again associated with Amateur Astronomy as a member of three clubs in a large metropolitan area in the South West. In the three clubs there is but one Black member and nary a Mexican. Virtually all members are White with a handful of Asians scattered over the three clubs of circa 500 members. Its a White thing.As to the Great Outdoors, earlier this month my wife and I spent a week visiting Utah for the first time. On the driving trip we visited two National Parks: Bryce Canyon and Zion. Even though it was not the busy Summer season yet both Parks were bulging with visitors. My impression was 95+% were Whites from America and Europe, 3 or 4% were Asians. Virtually no Blacks or Mexicans were seen and those there were conspicuous in their dearth. I asked a tour guide in Bryce who ran a Park Service three and a half hour tour by bus about visitors. The man was retired forest service and had been a tour guide for over fifteen years there. He said that each year more visitors came to Bryce and last year it was over 2.5 million visitors and virtually all were White with a small Asian contingent.Dan Kurt

They’re just not that into nature.  And that’s ok.  Not everything’s an IQ thing.

                        I’ve always viewed camping/backcamping as recreating your own version of civilization. In my experience, blacks aren’t really into it, hispanics here and there, and I’ve never seen asians camping. Blacks view it as a “white person thing”.
This article from SWPL is hilarious:https://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2009/08/14/128-camping/

            There are three simple words that a large portion of the population in Western countries needs to learn. Especially in relation to their “betters” and the people who reside in government offices.
Repeat after me:
GO FUCK YOURSELF.
Say it daily.  Say it multiple times daily.  Make sure you say it to people who really deserve to have it said to them.  Keep saying it until it sinks in.
Make sure you MEAN IT.

                What good will it do to tell members of the proglodyte overclass, “Go fuck yourself”? If they pay any attention at all, that will just confirm in their locked minds that the uncouth hayseeds don’t appreciate the necessity for their lives to be directed by Harvard intellectuals.Sure, we can’t helpfeelinga little better when we see demos and sign waving by the peasants protesting against the rule of the elite state. But it is naive to believe that anything of the sort will issue in regime change.What it will take is … honestly, I don’t want to spell it out. I’ll admit it scares me to think about it. I’m not tough enough for the future.

                    Go fuck yourself is the prelude to  We deal in lead, friend.Assuming that the elite will understand anything else or give anything that isn’t taken by force is folly at this point  They, their institutions , their quislings and helpers have to be removed from power for goodNow it can be mitigated State force and therefore “legal” as such things go which is what everyone on our side is hoping for but the elite? They’ve failed at job one, preserving society and have to go.The only caveat is our side must rule and manage a complex society and trying to recreate the 18th Century minimum state the founders wanted is follyRule or be enslaved

                    It seems I have to explain better.A) Dumb people just say ” Go fuck  yourself ” and then start coming up with Roseanne Barr level insults aimed at the target in question.B) “Smart” people in my experience have a habit of coming up with all manner of justifications to NOT tell people to go fuck themselves.When you tell a person to go fuck themselves – and then explain to them in clear concise language what they just did wrong – you KNOW what they did wrong – and why you’re going to make them pay for it and pay for it severely  – I’ve found it usually makes them shut right the hell up.Example:  Many years ago on my way to school – I took a short cut thru some narrow country roads – one of these came out right at the inside bend of road.  People would speed on that road – so you needed to look both ways very quickly – make so no traffic was coming – and pull out QUICKLY.So I went to pull out one morning – some guy was speeding around the corner, saw my car about to pull out – panicked and jammed his brakes on – and slid down the road in front of me directly into a stone wall.The thing is this – I didn’t pull out – my car jumped about 3 feet – I stopped – he could have swerved to avoid – but he was an incompetent driver – who was speeding – so he hung his car up on the stone wall.I sat there and watched the guy for a minute or two – he pulled his car off the wall – and drove off down the street.  I was late for school – it was his fault – so I left.As I’m sitting in my car waiting at a light about a mile up the road – up comes this guy behind me – speeding like a maniac once again – and pulls up behind me and starts berating me for “making him go off the road”.I looked at the guy from the driver’s seat and said something along the lines of:” Look – you were speeding on that road – the speed limit is 25 –  you were doing like 40.  I know – because I SPEED ON THAT ROAD ALL THE TIME – the corner I was trying to pull out of was a blind corner – I can’t see anything either way for more than about 100 feet – and as soon as I saw your car – I stomped on my brakes and stopped – you had more then enough space to swerve around me IF YOU KNEW HOW TO DRIVE YOUR CAR – you obviously don’t – and  you kept your foot on the brakes for good 100 feet after you passed my my car – we can go back and look at the skid marks if you like – as far as me waiting to see if you’re ok – you pulled your car off the wall and drove away – I knew you weren’t dead.  This whole thing is entirely YOUR FAULT – now you’re going to chase me all over town and try to blame me when you AND I know damn well you were speeding like crazy on that narrow road ?  Seriously dude – if I have to get out of this car I am going to beat you with extreme prejudice – walk back to your car and drive away and go learn how to drive better and maybe you won’t have these problems in the future”The guy shut the hell – turned around – walked back to his car – and drove away.You see – if you are saying FUCK YOU to people (either literally or figuratively – like the example above) – and they’re not taking it to heart – well then I don’t think you’re doing it right.Threats of violence do wonders at unlocking closed minds.  I’ve pulled the above trick multiple times in my life and in every single case – the other person simply WALKED.  No fights, no more complaining – nothing.  It even works with women – occasionally. Women often will just dig in and make it an emotional shitfest.  When they do that – the only way to take them out is to start pushing their buttons – calmly – until they completely go berserk and you can get them arrested or taken out of circulation by concerned friends or family members.In regards to the cloud class – I this dynamic probably accounts for a good part of the reason why there’s such a push for gun control.  There’s quite a bit of “they need to hang” and ” we need to shoot them” sentiment out there floating around.Somebody told me the other day that Hillary made some comment about how “if she goes down half of Washington goes with me” .  Seems to me that would imply they already KNOW what they did wrong – and they KNOW there’s a lot of people out there with firearms who think Hillary and ilk are worthwhile targets – therefore that dynamic is already in play.I think what you’re referring to is lower level “cloud” people.  These are the people who need to get reminded to their face what they did – and get told what the consequences will be.  Carry a picture of Mussolini hanging by his boot heels to drive the point home that those in power do not always escape justice.Keep practicing until you can make people walk away.  That’s when you are getting it right.

            I don’t see any pressure on foreigners to assimilate. Whites are simply expected to adjust to the differences in those around them. The fact that nobody on their street speaks English any more is “vibrant.”
They talk about more minorities biking, but the only actions they will ever take in that direction will, mark my words, express themselves as inconveniences to or costs to White people.

                “Assimilation” is a dirty word to Leftists. Assimilation is People of Color adopting white attitudes and behaviors. It is the opposite of multiculturalism, where all groups retain their distinctive attitudes and behaviors, while respecting and honoring each other.
With regard to cycling, it’s my experience that white hipsters cycle is because it’s green and anti-capitalist (auto and oil companies). Blacks cycle when they have no better mode of transport.

        your writing here perfectly exhibits two of the most common fallacies expressed by dissident right writers:1. you say that the british leaders are silly and or crazy…they are not…they are smart people who are going to get well paid by the globalist corporations after they help thwart the populist rebellion by whites…the big corporations will pay them well if they do what the corporations want…that is not silly or crazy…that’s smart…there is a difference between pretending to be silly or crazy or stupid and actually being silly or crazy or stupid …here in american the conservative pundits call the GOP the stupid party…but in actuality the GOP congress is not stupid…they are smart…they are getting access to IPOs, insider trading tips, and sweetheart contract deals…who gives these gifts? Rich people who are using immigration to prop up the ponzi economy so they can keep getting rich…getting rich by thwarting the white populist rebellion is not silly or stupid or crazy…it’s smart…2. you claim that britain is beyond hope even though they are still 80% white, implying that america, which is putatively 65% white, is not beyond. This is incorrect. America is the one beyond hope. Britain could still make a comeback. But in order to beat the elites and their foreign hordes, they would first have to understand that their treasonous leaders are not silly or stupid or crazy, but are instead venal and treasonous and corrupt….

            If the people in charge were really smart, they would be able to understand the trend of history and prepare for it better than simply buying into a gated community. Allowing your own country to collapse isn’t smart…it’s the action of a person who is either silly or crazy. There is a third possibility as well: evil. Personally, I vote for #3.

How long will those gated communities, country clubs and exclusive zip code will protect the elites when the security forces and government is composed of the very savages that they imported and now try to keep out with the gates and whatnot?
Not very long is the answer. Once the savages have the weapons the elites get a dirt nap.

            Some are pure opportunists, but many believe their own propaganda.  Their propaganda is lunacy and they are loons. This is probably more true of both British parties (3 if you bother to count the Liberals) and the American Dems, less true of the American Repubs.

In other words, what we have here is that the elites are pushing an ideology–an anti-white/pro-nonwhite ideology…and in turn there are millions of ordinary white people who adopt this ideology in order to serve their own best interests…they internalize this elite ideology and they make that ideology personal to themselves…thus, the ordinary white person internalizes, adopts and believes this elite ideology in order to get ahead in life..the elites select out of the pool of available labor those whites who have best adopted and internalized the elite ideology…so yes in a sense they do believe their own propaganda…that is a fundamental characteristic of mankind–the ability to internalize the ideas pushed by the leaders of the tribe…

                    Arizona’s tuff to figure out isn’t it? Are there any readers out there who can tell us what this McCain worship is all about? Of course I have no room to talk; my two state senators are arguably the worst ineffectual libtards ever elected.

                        I lived there for several years. McCain is not just a Senator, he’s a machine. McTammany Hall. He’s got the Chamber, developers, ASU/UA/NAU juggernaut, the courts and lawyers … in short, he’s not just a man, he’s corruption personified.
Most people in AZ, including myself, vote for him because they don’t know better — many are newbies and transients — and he’s got the magic “R” after his name. After an election cycle, or two, people figure it out, but by then, like me, they’re off to the next state.

        While the British government frets about the lack of minority bikers, would it be okay for a white British citizen to make that observation publicly? I don’t think it would, if he said it as an example of how different the immigrants are from the native population.  But he gets the green light if he points out that it’s caused by white discrimination or privilege or some type of reason you can track back to whitey.

        Oh, and I can think of one easy way to get more Asians and other minorities cycling around London: rickshaws.  Ever ridden in one?  It’s pretty awesome if you like cosplaying as Lord Curzon (and who doesn’t?).  And the Liberals could apologize to the poor coolie all the way to their destination.  The Guardian could write 5 million words of thumbsuckers about the need for unionization in the cycle-rickshaw industry.  What’s not to like?  (That one’s free, Comrade Cycling Commissar.  I’ve got lots more.  Call me!)

        I’m afraid that Mr. Derbyshire is correct. Britain is now North Korea with shopping malls. The clown people control every aspect of our society from the government, every agency of the state, the administration, the corporations, the education system, the police, the judiciary, the media, the security services, the church – everything. And their control is total.We have “Conservative” Party  in government which makes American liberal democrats look like the John Birch Society by comparison. The alternatives are EVEN WORSE, if you can believe that.No dissent is permitted.It’s like we were taken over by pod people while we slept. I am truly in despair as there is no sign of salvation or a cure nor any conceivable route through which one could emerge.That said, Britain is a mysterious country. Even with the entire weight of the media, the academy and the establishment against it, they still voted for their independence. We will not get it, of course, but it does show that there is a still a flame guttering away in the darkness somewhere.

        I think Trump is forcing the issue on the EU. I don’t think the Saudis would have withdrawn their ambassador and banned German goods without consulting with Trump. Backdoor hardball. And they respond by market manipulation when a right wing government gets elected in Italy.
Common market? A commons always ends up being enclosed. I thought peoples who had lived through the late middle ages and the enlightenment would have been smart enough to figure that one out.

            Goodwhites are implicitly white supremacist in a way that race realists are not.  How is the Sierra Club fretting about the “Unbearable Whiteness of Hiking and How to Solve It” any different from whites in the 19th century trying to turn Africans or Amerindians into whites?  The underlying assumption is that non-whites would like what goodwhites like if non-whites were not oppressed.  Isn’t it possible that Hispanics, for example, simply don’t like state parks?  Assuming that non-whites must want to be like goodwhites is white supremacist.

                Race realists can accept the observation that Sun People (Derb’s term) don’t like national or state parks, or things like hiking and skiing, etc.  Goodwhites can’t accept it.  For them, there has to be a reason and the reason cannot be that they simply have different likes and preferences, and it’s certainly not anything having to do with how their brains work.  The solution to this “problem” has to be ferreted out, and somehow whitey has to be at fault.

        Speaking to The Independent, Mr Norman, whose job it is to deliver on Sadiq Khan’s pledge to make walking and cycling safer and easier in the capital, said: “There is a problem with cycling and the way it is perceived of getting middle-aged men cycling faster around the city, which is not the objective at all.This is such an insane paragraph. While there’s nothing wrong with “safer and easier” one presumes that a lot of people cycle for very utilitarian reasons and thus “faster” is also important to quite a lot of people. In fact, I bet a lot of people directly equate “easier” to “faster” as in, if someone says it’s not easy to get from point A to point B, it means getting from point A to point B is slow, whether due to lots of stops, congestion, pedestrian and vehicle traffic in the way, or whatever.Anything that gets “middle-aged men cycling faster around the city” will do the same for all people who are not middle-aged men, so why exactly is that not the objective, and what in the worldisthe objective?

        At this point Uncle Sugar can’t do much for them.  They’ll either figure out how to fight it out for themselves or they won’t.  Certainly the Poles and Hungarians have figured it out.  But those miscellaneous Slavs never had the softness of the Pax Americana…they had the Soviet fist.

            I tremble to think what will make us the Poles and Slavs in the someday future.Hope we make it.
The Mongol/Islamic Golden Horde lorded it over Eastern Europe for 900 years…
What astonishes me, though, are the deplorables.  European society cast out it’s rubbish- orphans, convicts,  the dregs of it’s slums- and wherever they landed, these slaves built a high civilization within a hundred years.  Four generations to do something the natives could not in 10,000.

                Well, in the early days it wasn’t like you bought a discount ticket to howling wilderness on Virgin Atlantic.  Own family got here between 1629 and 1700…and just surviving the trip over and the first few years probably weeded out the lower end of the gene pool.  Think that’s how you produced two Continental Congresses and a Constitutional convention out of the equivalent population of southern Wisconsin.

        Unfortunately, we have too many children pretending to be adults here in the U.S. as well. I remember turning on the TV some years ago (back when I had TV service) and watching with dismay an Obama whitehouse spokesperson make a statement to the media. She sounded sophomoric. She sounded like a first year college student making her first presentation to class. It was actually painful to watch.
I never watched another press statement from the obama administration again. I moved and binned my TV service before the ’16 election.

                The thing about Obama is that he never really “did” anything prior to running for congress in Illinois. He had a very thin resume, and that’s putting it charitably. Of course he was way out of his depth as POTUS.

            One attractive feature of Trump on the campaign trail, was that he was the only one who consistently spoke to us as if we were functioning adults.  The condescending third grade scolding and pats on the head from Obama/Hillary (and from the rest of the candidates, too, for the most part) were insulting.

                Zman pointed out that the Cloud People despise us, the Dirt People, and hate the Deplorables.  They regard us as zoo animals.  I prefer the analogy that we are livestock to be cared for as long as we are useful.Much of what motivates the welfare state is the elitist view that the common people are too stupid and feckless to  look after themselves.  Well, they – we – did throughout most of history.  It seems to me that people have grown more stupid and feckless as the welfare state has grown and they are relieved of personally taking responsibility for themselves, their families and communities.  The British and European elite has grown more stupid and feckless since 1945 because they were relieved of personally taking responsibility for their own defense.  They’ve been hiding behind the US’ skirts, so to speak.Did the US want the British and Europeans to take responsibility for their own defense or was their perpetual dependency the price the US paid to be the boss?

                One great moment came in the third debate with Trump, when Hillary started talking in her scolding schoolmarm way, how police need to undergo training to correct their unconscious bias in dealing with minorities.

        In an earlier essay you talked about how boring it must have been to govern a western European country a few decades ago.  If everyone in the country was English or Dutch, how do you beat them over the head to be “diverse” and “multicultural”?
So they had to import a massive underclass of Third World rejects. These new peasants could be counted on the vote for evermore government while causing enough mayhem to justify bigger state surveillance and security apparatuses.  And having lots of obnoxious brown people about is a great excuse to hector the normals.

        I would argue that the European elite is implementing US policy. The policies maybe clownish but the implemetation is ,sadly, less so. .The US wants Europe to be post-white and wants to reverse the Brexit vote.The US is not protecting Europe but forcing it down the same path the US is currently on.Even the example of “Bike Tsar” is about creating a vast habitat for neo-liberal parasites and  to create the impression that the sensible citizen is a beleaguered minority. For Americans to claim the UK is a clown country is a wee bit rich considering the nature of your country and its pervasive role in promoting these awful policies.You are correct about the degenerate nature of the type of people who become UK politicians. It’s good that you are aware that they do not necessarily represent the majority of British people.I wouldn’t assume that Derbyshire knows much about the UK or that his opinion represents a fair reckoning. I remember in one of his NR articles he tried to use the example of life in Brixton as being broadly indicative of the UK experience. Anyone who claims this is either extremely ignorant or just a liar.

            I’d argue Tel’Aviv has more pull on Downing St.  than Washington most days of the week, but you may call such a thing a distinction without a diffirence. Regardless, as an outsider to both the US and Europe, I don’t see the direct lines you describe. There is an immense amount of cultural and economic exchange across the Atlantic and that includes subterfuge (eg. MI5 and the Trump camp or neocons and the Blair inner circle), but the hierarchy of the broader western empire isnt so crystal clear. It’s a lot of neoliberals who fancy themselves the top of the food chain back-biting for status and power among themselves. That they don’t snub one another directly suggests they view the project of introducing the full global monty as worth any price. I’d chock this up more to the massive windfalls they are sure to enjoy in the shirt term than anything else, but the universal class of effete urbanites reaching a conscious consensus through their many shared institutions is another.

                    Kansas has a surprising ability to draw farm money. They obviously can’t compete with AIPAC for loyalty, but I don’t know of any electable candidates from the last century who would challenge big ag. either. The problem with the regional elites of America is the same as the state (let) elites in Europe. They identify and support a raft of issues for their class and care nothing at all for their civilization. You can find the same level of disloyalty in many elite political dens of Israel too. The diffirence is that our fiercely tribal middle and lower classes are willing to be undiplomatic in response to such disloyalty and have thus cultivated a comparatively reactionary political center.

        Thanks to Tyler Cowen and his brilliant meta-econo-historical analysis, I now see that Ethiopia and China are really the same (more or less), and that Ethiopia – and by implication all the rest of Africa – is poised to transform itself into a real-life Wakanda.  And just think, all they needed was a little nudge from western globo-managerial-class experts like Tyler Cowen for this miracle to occur.  These visionary people really are as special as they think they are.

        The UK Left before they went nuts after Thatcher understood this and some of the farther Left pols floated the idea of banning Public schools (what we call Private schools) to make sure the  bullying sodomy and caning culture was broken and that the rich find it much harder to opt out of bad policy choicesIt didn’t happen and may not have been a sound idea but in a society with few races  issues making sure that some rich Lord or rich whosoever’s kid is in the same boat as a Chav has  a certain philosophical  meritFuture societies that want to live will have to either burden the rich heavily with difficult obligations to prevent them from being rabbits  or make sure they can’t escape bad policy not matter how much money they haveIts about as illiberal as you can get but often as not these days wealthy people and technology are the cause of the problem, not the solution   to it.

        Moldbug was right that modern liberalism is essentially an American thought virus that became an invasive species in other lands (including Europe), where, unlike in its homeland, it has no natural resistance to keep it in check. In America, for every Jefferson, Susan B. Anthony, and Barack Obama, there has been a Madison, a Mencken, and a Donald Trump. Yes, America has slid leftward for a hundred years, but at least here there has been *some* real resistance to it, whereas the western Europeans have succumbed to it like the Aztecs succumbing to smallpox (and for the same reason).

        It’s a question of location!  I toured the uk recently and most of the diversity appeared centered in London proper.  The outlands were mostly still English, especially wales.  The diversity was even low in Edinburgh, which is the major city in Scotland.
My point being that the situation could be contained with a correction of political philosophy and leadership.

        Speaking of Tommy Robinson,  today I notice a headline link to a NR article  – “Tommy Robinson Drew Attention to ‘Grooming Gangs.’ Britain Has Persecuted Him.”Oh ok,  I’ll bite even though its an NR article.  Of course after reading the article,  the title should have been penned  “Tommy Robinson,  Victim of His Own Belligerence”.   The meat of the article was all about pointing out everywhere that Tommy has gone wrong or did wrong since he formed the EDL.  With a sprinkling of  Grooming Gang info layered in so some credence could be given to the headline.The sort of thing that leftists here have wet dreams about doing to somebody like James O’Keefe.

        The British did what most of the world did – currying favours with Hillary Clinton as everyone expected her to become president. They were in a position to do a  lot more than others and took the opportunity. Look at the list of international donors to Clinton Foundation, lots of different countries there .Brexit is a prestige and a power issue. Britain derives its power and influence as an intermediary between us and EU (see  recent Schengen database scandal) and Brexit (departing the political union ) makes them redundant. Witness trump going straight to the core Europe – France and Germany and reducing Britain (through NATO) to a auxiliary military force

        TheZman Crushes it on Britain!Thanks for taking the time to write this piece. It is an issue I believe important and something I’ve written about on occasion.https://www.maddogslair.com/blog/the-zman-crushes-it-on-britain“This is the heart of the matter. The Pax Americana, which has guaranteed peace in Europe for the last 75 years, has done more than pacify the continent. It has turned the political classes of Europe into children. They are not real leaders in any meaningful sense, because no matter what they do, Uncle Sam is there to make sure they never get a serious boo-boo. Because they are insulated from serious consequences, they have become the Eloi, playing dress-up and pretending to be big boys and girls.”This is exactly correct. Europe and Britain have been behaving like children living in the basement of their American parents since WWII. For the first 20 years or so, this was acceptable; the continent had suffered two back to back apocalyptical wars. But after 1970, this behavior was unacceptable. The problem was the continentals had decided to shift government spending from adult tasks to the task of infantilizing their people through the expansion of the welfare state, and socialized medicine. That worked like a charm. The doubled down with the elimination of self-defense and eliminating the right to keep and bear arms.“This is why the Brexit negotiations have come to a halt. The renegotiating of Britain’s economic relationship with the Continent is difficult and complicated. No one on either side of the table is capable of doing anything other than showing up at a candlelight vigil following the latest Muslim attack. These are not serious people. Instead, they are silly people who worry about diversity on the bike path. The only way Brexit gets finalized is if Trump decides to get involved and forces the issue. Otherwise, it never happens.”This is the same reason that Obama needed to get involved and keep the yammerhead, er, leaders of Europe from allowing 1 million feral humans to invade the continent bringing crime, poverty, and terrorism in their wake.“The clownishness does not stop at the political class. The vaunted British security apparatus has also degraded into play-land. It’s obvious now that they were roped into helping that old fool John Brennan’s scheme to spy on the Trump campaign. There was a time when the Brits would have seen that for what it was and not got involved. Instead, they put on daddy’s old suits and played James Bond, causing a serious riff between the two countries. Notice Trump’s treatment of Theresa May versus Emmanuel Macron.In a better age, when the king realized the court he inherited was not up for the job, he would get a new court. On the other hand, when it was clear the new king was dangerously feeble-minded, the king fell off his horse and they got a new king. In this age, when the people realize their rulers are supercilious poseurs, incapable of doing the basics of government, they are supposed to vote for new rulers. The trouble is, this is not a political problem. It is a cultural problem. Britain is ruled by a clown culture now.There’s only one way to fix that.”Indeed. I have encouraged the Brits to take our Declaration of Independence update it and nail it to the door of Westminster Hall. I suspect that is a bridge too far for what passes as Brits today. But I can still hope!My Open Letter is below:A Short Open Letter to the Brits!https://www.maddogslair.com/blog/a-short-open-letter-to-the-britsMark Sherman

        I legitimately feel bad for not knowing what the “…one way to fix that” is. I am in suspense. That last sentence breaks your normal paragraph structure further increasing my angst.
Some possible solutions:
1) shoot the clowns.2) stop “protecting” them with US defense spending.3) #freeTommy4) play Hearts of Iron, win Battle of Britain, do operation Sea Lion.
I’m at a loss.

                The elites always do that – seal off all avenues of reform. Why? Because they are better than us and are much smarter and informed as well.
And when do people like that take advice from “dirt people”? Never. They look at some angry steel worker or engineer who is losing their job to globalization and think, ‘that’s progress’.  The same with the flooding of the West with 3rd worlder savages.
So it leaves us to implement option #1.

        Sadiq Khan, or whatever his name is, has ONE objective, and that is to get more muslims doing anything and everything, and being in charge of anything and everything, and making the rules for anything and everything, to the ultimate detriment of everyone else, as well as to London and England itself, not to mention the world.

        The REAL problem is instead the UK “Law Enforcement”, who will do WHATEVER they are told, as long as that paycheck keeps comin’ in.  Their perfidy was apparent when they enabled the murder of Alfie Evans.  Tommy Robinson is merely icing on that same cake.Eliminating any of the “leaders” in the UK will get you nothing.  They are all totally replaceable by any random person off the streets of London.  On the other hand, if UK “Law Enforcement” and their spouses were to start dying, that would tend to realign the dinner conversations about the appropriateness of a career in “Law Enforcement”.  With the plods gone, THEN touching the “leaders” would fix the problem.  Not one minute before then, however.And don’t try to give me the bull about “They’d just find more to replace the “Law Enforcement” who leave.  Your Betters are not about to give pig toys to anyone who might conceivably use same against them.   That is why, in the US, the overwhelming majority of “Law Enforcement” are Republicans.  ROVE Republicans, with all the character traits associated with same:No morals.No principles.No scruples.No honor.Your Betters are not about to give pig toys to any of Barry Sotero’s “gun-hugging, Bible-thumping veterans who believe in the Constitution”.  And the Social Justice Whores won’t get said toys either.  Most of those would go incontinent if a gun was placed in their hands.  And the rest would gladly use those weapons on the Elite.  That leaves the Blacks and the Hispanics, but while either of those would be glad to exterminate Whitey, they also fight between their tribes.  And once Whitey was gone, they would turn on the Elite.  So the “Law Enforcement” labor pool is largely already maxed out.

            If you’re talking about Management, with regards to Rove Republicans in law Enforcement, you are spot on.The rank and file are the polar opposite.It’s mind boggling how a handful of examples of police misconduct color the opinions of the commenters on this blog. Police handle hundreds of thousands of calls for service, and the few instances of police brutality, stupidity, and incompetence colors us all.Oh well, you can believe what you want, but know that most of us have already prepared to exit our current positions. A full 1/3 of the department in Chicago will exit in the next few years, leaving 6,000 police, down from 13,500, when I started.Avoid Chimpcongo at all costs. It’s sporty now, and will only get worse.….wow, that was rambling….

                That’s a very nice story you tell.  But if there were truly only a “handful of examples of police misconduct”, how come THOSE “bad apples” aren’t gone?  The barrel is rotten to its very core.

                That is a perfect response to Yak’s post.For a long time I thought jolly old England had just fallen down and was a bit dizzy, things would clear up. Then Brexit happened and I “knew” things were going to change.Nope.They ARE literal clowns now, but the ones with the sad faces. Heartbreaking really, beyond parody, watching their bobbies run amok arresting all the wrong people, twisting themselves into pretzels protecting the wrong people. Over and over and over.

Next time you see a bit in The Grauniad about “Native Americans” throw a comment in there that mentions the “Native English” and see how long it lasts before the memory hole comes for it.
