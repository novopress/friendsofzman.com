        Neither evolution nor high jew IQ is fact. In fact, both are myths. Only a low IQ person would propagate such nonsense. Or a reasonably high IQ traitor.Either way, the author is full of krap and completely ignored the facts staring him/her/it in the face.

        In general, I read that the chosen people were Christians, but the Jews somehow managed to seize power. And perhaps they are smarter because they don’t drink alcohol, but for example, people in Russia like to drink. This is exactly what the Jews took advantage of. And I also read that the Jews were originally a sect.

        The argument is that there is no large N direct measure of g that shows Ashkenazi scoring higher. You didn’t provide one, so this claim is evidently true. The hypothesis is that there are other credible explanations for Ashkenazi success in specific intellectual endeavors. You also provided no evidence to the contrary. All you did was point a finger and mock.This is a very sleazy post. You have very clearly straw-manned the argument and your excuse is that you’re ignorant of the underlying data and can’t be bothered to do any research. You do this a lot in your writing because you think you can get away with being lazy since you aren’t insane.It is also questionable that you’ve “just heard” of Neema Parvini. Charles Haywood is very familiar with Parvini’s work, and you link to Haywood’s main site in your blog roll. Again, you do this a lot in your writing. You will often claim to be unfamiliar with core arguments against your chosen point of view. To an intelligent observer this is an indication of your ignorance of mendacity.I’m not saying I think you are a subversive agent, or a bad person, or even wrong all the time. Or this time. I am just pointing out that the rhetorical argument you’ve chosen won’t work on intelligent people.

        Academic Agent is not a liberal and doesn’t deny IQ or heredity. He’s very aware of the JQ but not obsessed with them. His post doesn’t claim that they AREN’T more intelligent, just that the evidence for this official explanation is very weak. Maybe a waste of time though.I would bet that the Ashkenazim do have an IQ above 100, as stereotypes are generally true. There is evidence of selection for IQ over the last few hundred years, with them having all kinds of alleles which boost IQ at the expense of all kinds of genetic disorders and mental problems.Intelligence doesn’t come close to explaining their dominance. Their ethnocentrism is commendable, although their shamelessness in exploiting the goodwill of their hosts is not.

        I don’t buy it. I think it’s as simple as the small and extremely clannish tribe tipping the scales in their favor through underhanded tactics like bribery and coercion.“The sudden emergence of jewish figures” Lines up a bit too conveniently with “the sudden emergence of stock exchanges and large banking conglomerates”.A big part is that is due to white naivety sure… (religious prohibitions against usury and the like) but that doesn’t prove jewish intelligence, it simply proves jewish immorality. And that cheaters have a distinct advantage over non-cheaters.It doesn’t take a genius to bribe people. It also doesn’t take a genius to figure out that information is power and a good way to use one’s wealth advantage in a democracy would be to control the dissemination of information by buying up newspapers and publishing houses. Then later came hollywood with it’s emotional conditioning potential. For 100 years they have practiced the art, but what do we see now? They purged all their good white shabbos in the recent DEI push and it’s become crap. But why? Jews are still at the top positions in the industry. Observable reality does not support the high IQ theory.Scientific studies can easily be falsified and prizes are often awarded based on politics rather than merit.“Jews constituted 0.8% of Germany’s 1930s population and 24% of it’s Nobel laureates”LMAO. Just LMAO Richard Lynn. This is not objective. This was a society of war weary peasants under the thrall of a financial overlord class at the time. That class awarded itself honors, big surprise. Did germany fall into intellectual stagnation after it kicked out all of these “nobel prize winning geniuses”? Or did it almost win a war in which it was outnumbered by more than 6 to 1?Again, LMAO. If you control the money and the media then you control the official statistics. Observable reality and tangible results speak louder than words on paper. They make observably bad decisions with observably bad results, despite their access to money and power. Jews are not smart.

            Even assuming a Jewish advantage in average intelligence, the much larger Gentile population means there are many more Gentiles of high intelligence than Jews. If this advantage is not manifest in the actual social situation, than something else besides intelligence is determining that outcome. In any case, intelligence makes an enemy more dangerous, not less.

                I read the post. The point was that people who think like me have a bias based on moral principals that necessitate removing from our enemies the traits which we hold in high regard. It’s a valid argument, but I don’t buy it in 2024.The decisions they are making and have made are simply too self destructive and imprudent for me to believe that they are an intelligent race. An intelligent parasite would not kill it’s host.It would develop a somewhat mutually beneficial symbiosis. One that would benefit it more strongly, but one in which it would also be cognizant and respectful of it’s dependence on said host.Jews have done the opposite. They are not smart. I don’t think I am underestimating them. Even without wisdom controlling the lions share of the money supply and the media make them an impressively powerful force. That’s just obvious. Their problem is that they have imprudently created conditions in which their grip on dominance is becoming increasingly tenuous.Most whites don’t trust the news, are highly skeptical of “experts”, don’t want to join the army and are increasingly opting out of society. Their replacements for us, high IQ Indians and asians the like, are competent sure, but not innovative, and not loyal to anything other than money as have not been molded by decades of liberal brainwashing. They are here for the cash, and the west’s credit cards are pretty close to maxing out.The Indian CEO of google will go along with and parrot DEI and race blindness rhetoric on behalf of his paymasters, but he doesn’t believe it. Liberal whites did, but they had to go because jews gassed themselves up on the hollobunga. Jews are dumb. Not retarded though, they are attempting to walk back the situation a bit by promoting right wing thought a bit more, but it won’t work. Leftism has created a hardcore contingent of true believers and that belief is that the underdog is the undisputed moral king. Jews can no longer convince anyone of the lie that they are underdogs, they have lost the “good whites”. They could have kept parasitizing the evangelical “bad whites” in perpetuity.Their plan seems to be now to let Trump win and half heartedly whip up some degree of patriotism in an attempt to fix military recruitment numbers for the greater Israel middle east domination project. It won’t work. They appear to be somewhat successful in whipping up anti-muslim sentiment in the UK and EU but the project’s overall success looks unlikely. The west is simply too weak after this many decades of cultural and industrial rot. The Houthis just took down another ship last week. NATO has a hollowed out industrial base and the third world is increasingly going it’s own way and creating parallel institutions. BRICS just doubled in membership size.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/03/saturday-night-live-joe-biden-age/72830206007/Won’t work. A smart parasite does not kill it’s host.

                    If it’s necessary for to you to believe that a middling race of unscrupulous pawn brokers had to have been smart in order to dominate a society of naive but hardworking and moral Christians… You can think that. But I think it’s just a manifestation of another sort of biased thinking based on pride and a sense of moral superiority.I think that people who play dirty and have a morality based around subverting established ethical codes (Talmud)  wouldn’t require superior intelligence to get where they are today. Chutzpah is enough of an advantage.Playing dirty and focusing on how to effectively undermine the rules of the game doesn’t imply intelligence, it implies low moral character.Nice guys finish last. We need to accept that reality. Doesn’t mean we need to be devils, but it does mean we need to stop handicapping ourselves temporarily until things get sorted. Whites need to develop some Chutzpah and stop being so nice.Deportation isn’t a kind thing to do, but it’s not barbaric or bloodthirsty and is necessary if we want to still be around in a hundred years. That’s just obvious.

                    I would add anecdotally that I haven’t been especially impressed by the intelligence of Jews I’ve known in real life.  The perception of them being especially intelligent hinges on them talking a lot and rapidly, but if you’re fast enough to follow it you realize they aren’t saying anything particularly clever.  They’re an entire race of bullshitters and that’s why they dominate in fields that reward dissimulation and a loose attitude towards the truth.
The sad reality of life is that an aggressive pushy sociopath will get much further in life than a taciturn thoughtful introvert.

                    I think I should also say that people are often scared to oppose those who they think are inherently superior or have some secret ingenious 4d chess plan that we are simply too stupid to notice or understand.I don’t think it’s helpful or accurate to view the small hats as an 115 IQ race of ubermensches. Reality just doesn’t comport with that claim and it should be pointed out that that sort is of thinking played a big part in what led us to this situation in the first place.Trump’s trust in the Kushner clan certainly did him no favors.

            I’m similarly minded regarding the trope of “Jewish intelligence”. I bought into that for years, but no more. All we are seeing is otherworldly strong in-group preference masquerading as intelligence.

        Given that Askenazi Jews are primarily of European heritage — Germanic and Slavic — with a  mixture of Persian and some Middle Eastern (apparently less of that than one is apt to think,) what’s the magic gene that supposedly makes Jews so intelligent? And IQ is hardly the sole measure of intelligence.When a group has historically been forced into certain roles and trades — banking, finance, education, the professions — it’s no wonder the group has developed those traits  that correlate highly with what’s commonly called intelligence. Jewish Americans are intermarrying with non-Jews at a rapid clip, while Indians and Asians who used to be called Orientals are pulling ahead of the Jews on standard intelligence tests.

        “Putting the purely political, there is a larger different reason behind the IQ-denialism you see in posts like the one from Academic Agent. Intelligence as a biological fact strikes them as determinism, which contradicts their liberal conditioning. For most of human history humans knew the apple to did not fall far from the tree, so the idea of men having superior genetics would not be shocking. In fact, it is the assumption that is the foundation of inherited rule, the norm for mankind.”Of all the actors in the larger Dissident Right/Online Right space, I definitely wouldn’t consider AA to be under liberal conditioning. Of all the people you could name, it might actually be at the bottom of any such list. Just pointing that out for people here who haven’t heard of him. From that comment I’m going to assume Zman was not aware of AA to any significant degree.

                I’ll yield my spot of the penultimate contemptuous disdainer of VoxDay to no one.AA is no VoxDay.  But I don’t read his substacks and his youtube stuff just goes on and on.His books (the non Shakespeare ones) are excellent.   You could do worse than to add “The Populist Delusion” to your Essential Knowledge catalogue.  At his best, he’s the British version of Auron MacIntyre.(The need to constantly grind out and monetize new content constantly is tricky, as I’m sure you know.  AA fails at this and “trying harder” doesn’t really work.  Even a British accent only gets you so far.)

                I like putting his youtube show on and listening to it like talk radio.  My only gripe with his opinions is that he makes the common mistake of British right wingers where they look at their empire with rose-tinted glasses and claim America is the root cause of all the preversions.

                    I’m not in AA’s pay as a cheerleader, but I’d say that he does seem to have some good understanding of America’s past, and what has been lost.  Look at his video on Tennessee Ernie Ford, for example.  It’s sort of an elegy for what America used to be in some ways.  He has a lot of content that I haven’t yet watched or read, but I’ve been rewarded by much of what I have seen.You’re onto something with how some British commenters blame America for “the perversions,” but I have to agree with them:  Woke, DEI, mass-advertising/materialism,… a lot of this madness has gone eastwards across the Atlantic.  British universities and lower levels of education seemed to  generally hold out longer against PC and Woke, but now they’re undergoing the kind of transformation that they have over here, especially during the last few years.

                I really don’t see much if any similarity. Granted, I agree totally with Academic Agent’s theory about ideology as post-hoc justification for the attainment and consolidation of power*, and that colors my view of him, but he has none of the malignant monomania and rampant insecurity that haunts the other guy (who, to be fair, has some pretty brilliant insights himself from time to time).The two also have different modes of argumentation and reasoning in their writing, and that far exceeds the stylistic differences between the British and Americans. The biggest difference between the two is Agent’s absence of malice and needless drama.*Which puts me at odds with Keith Woods, who I find maybe the most important voice and figure among dissidents in many ways, but them’s the breaks.

                    Yes, Jack, I’ve gotten much more out of AA than from anything by VoxDay, who seems extremely bitter, negative, and obsessive.  I’m sure he has done some good work, but…
AA has done a lot of real scholarship, on Shakespeare, etc., and it shows.  It seems he was very well-educated, but his videos and writings mostly seem accessible, although a bit long sometimes.  He advertises his for-pay trivium classes sometimes, but it’s not as obtrusive as some people out there.

                        The similarities are there, of course, with the frequent Boomer-bashing and needling someone else prominent online to pick a public fight and so forth, but those are mildly annoying tics more than anything else. I might not have read AA enough to catch the analogy but it doesn’t seem to hold up.

            Correct. And since Darwinian evolution never occurred, all of the HBD stuff is not literally true either, since it relies upon Darwinism to provide its OS kernel.
At best, HBD is just a metaphor for something else, a deep spiritual dissonance that exists between certain races and classes. But you won’t find any HBDers admitting this. They defend Darwinism tooth and nail, because they think that rejecting it means succumbing to the dreaded blank-slatism. They destroy metaphysics just to oppose a few silly slogans of late 20th century cant—an extreme case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

                HBD depends on micro-evolution, which is an observable fact. Macro-evolution is not. Darwin’s observations of the Galapagos finches was an example of micro-evolution in action but the finches never became anything but a slightly different sort of finch.

        I think higher Ashkenazi IQ is verifiable reality and my view seems to be well represented in the comments. But how this happened is not: how this happened. As I understand Jewish tradition tended to reward the smartest Torah students with better jobs in the various businesses in the ghetto and the prettiest girls. In other words a highly eugenic culture (and that was not a criticism, quite the contrary)Meanwhile what did mainstream Europeans do? They sent many of their smartest men off to the monastery where sex was against the rules. This is extremely dysgenic.One group rewards high IQ with the cutest girls the rabbi can find. The other group sends it’s smartest lads off to no-girlie land. I could imagine eugenic vs dysgenic cultures and practices could explain a lot of the observed differences in IQ

            I think that the better explanation is that Jews, in Europe were restricted as to professions – merchants and esp money lending and the like. Numerical occupations. This was probably mostly a result of the fields that they couldn’t pursue, combined with those they were allowed to pursue (such as money lending, given the restrictions on Christians doing such). Success in these occupations translated into being more finally well off, and that, in turn meant more kids, grandchildren, etc, because they could afford more of them. Combine that with like marrying like financially, and the effect is compounded. Over half a millennium of evolutionary pressure  for better mathematical ability evolved into an increase in just that trait.

                    Entrance into the clergy in olden days was dictated more by order of birth than intelligence, nor were Jewish breeding practices particularly eugenic except in selecting for IQ above all else, as the defect-ridden Ashkenazi genome can attest (Tay-Sachs says “hi”).

            The most amusing explanation for Ashkenazi IQ that I have heard is that Jews and Gypsies are actually two sides of the same ethnic stock, The smarter ones claim to be descendants of the children of Israel while the left hand side of the bell curve claimed descent from the ancient  Egyptians. Both groups behave in a more or less similar way, the first tend towards banking, the second are notorious pickpockets. The one control the pornography business, the other will happily sell you his sister. Of course this is complete nonsense, however, if you were to combine the average IQ scores of the two groups it would probably come out pretty close to the European average, which makes you think.

        The same sentiment came up so many times, and I can’t figure out which this should be a reply to, so I’ll just put it here.IQ is a huge advantage when it comes to pushing numbers around in a spreadsheet or a general ledger. You know, the whole FIRE — Financial, Insurance, Real Estate. Now that FIRE is such a huge fraction of GDP, (and an embarrassingly large amount government or government mandated, which has many of the same rules about pushing numbers around) one cannot be surprised that even a small IQ advantage will have a disproportionate effect. There are now 4th and 5th order financial derivatives that I know of, and I’m sure the rabbit hole goes deeper.It would be relatively easy to de-emphasize FIRE in our economy, but it means we have to start making stuff again, instead of paying someone else to make it.  Or, as our current FIRE economy stands, pay someone to pay someone to pay someone to pay someone to make it.

            Yes.  This is where the brutal incompatibility hits.
The chosen are naturally more sexually perverse than we are.  Once they have power, they want to make the culture more comfortable to their proclivities.  But, even putting morality aside, what titillates them disgusts us.  Deeply.
Why is porn free?  Why is incest and interracial porn pushed so hard?  Because they like it and want it everywhere.

                The sudden “market” dominance of pseudo-incest porn is a perverse (yes) side effect of a current_year liberal obsession. In response to righties advocating various retvrns to tradition, feminists have become obsessive haters of heterosexual “age gap” relationships (of any sort). The average shitlib woman considers a forty year old man with a twenty-five year old wife a predatory pedophile—but an old gay man raping a prepubescent boy is not.What men desire in pornography, as in life, is young women. But Pornhub et al., at the “soft” direction of the American government, were forced to remove all signifiers of youth (and a few other feminist-forbidden things, e.g., drunkenness) from their material’s titles/premises. Demand for BARELY LEGAL TEENZ (etc.) is inflexible, though, so the pornographers sought a legalistic workaround. Turns out the word that most clearly signifies youth without being forbidden is “stepsister.”The usual suspects are of course to blame, but not in the expected way. Any morality- and family-destroying effects are fortuitous, this time.

                For the same reason nicotine patches do not stop the smoker, this will not work. Another big problem with your post is the reliance on an expert of addiction. Psychology is poison. Encouraging these sick creeps to role play their perversions will not redirect their energies; it will grow them. This further ignores the production of this horrendous material. Yes, I know you propose AI. Anyone with common sense, however, knows that the push is always for harder and harder stuff. This feeds that wicked, evil industry.To wit: distribute these dolls. And kill everyone who takes one.

        The blank slate is at the root of most, if not nearly all, of the problems with liberal democracy. While any society remains stuck in the blank-slate model, there’s little prospect of improvement or even a steady state. Paradoxically, most people agree that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree in their personal lives (“she looks just like her mom”), they can’t deal with it on a larger, impersonal, scale. It’s a curious disconnect that’s characteristic of the current era.

        High intelligence is not an unqualified virtue. It depends on what the environment wants. As I’ve written here before, if I’m in a jungle I want Conan by my side and not Woody Allen.High intelligence works in civilised settings, where we’re looking at the capacity to assimilate written material or integrate a function by parts or understand a balanced binary tree. In these settings Ashkenazis and East Asians triumph.Assuming a Bell curve, even a three point difference in two populations means very disproportionate numbers at the high end. I think it was either J.P. Rushton or Richard Lynn who pointed out that a three point difference will mean three or four times more people at the IQ 140+ level for the group scoring three points higher versus the group scoring lower.

            Ultimately, the difference in relative numbers at the high end is totally and completely irrelevant when they are 2% of the population. The number of Europeans will dwarf them at that end of the curve. In any case, it’s irrelevant. Intelligence alone simply does not and cannot account for the fact that 7 of the 8 Ivy League Presidents are Jewish, nor does it account for the fact that they are overrepresented in the student body of elite institutions by a factor of 10-15.Also note that the ONLY way it is acceptable to talk about IQ in polite company is to talk about how much smarter Jews are than White people. You can talk about the Jewish-White IQ gap to explain the Jewish overrepresentation in institutions or fields, even though it does not explain it. You absolutely cannot under any circumstances talk about the IQ gap between Whites and blacks to explain the same thing, though. That alone tells you that it’s not the full story.

You can’t. That opens Pandora’s Box of the IQ differences between whites and blacks.

        I really think that Jewish IQ is higher than White IQ and have no problem with that. Have you any problem knowing that there are people smarter, prettier or better than you? If you do that, you are a poor man and you have low self-esteem.But IQ is not the most relevant thing. In any given field, there are more White intelligent people than Jewish intelligent people, because, although Jew are more intelligent, there are a tiny minority in the world and in USA. This does not explain the success of Jewish people, which is almost total: in finance, in politics, in media, in business, in international organizations, etc…What makes Jews powerful is to be clannish in the only non-clannish society in the history of the world: Western society. There were the only clannish people until some decades ago. Now, we have more clannish peoples among us.This is why Indian average IQ is not that high, but Indian people are dominating tech and they had replaced Jews in the diamond business in Europe. If you are clannish, you can cooperate and “united we stand, divided we fall”. This is the common philosophy to every people in Earth: Indian, Chinese, Muslim, Latin American (where I live), African, etc. Everybody except us.We have another theory. We are proud of individualism!, as US people say. We want to compete in the market and let the best people win. We are color blind. We believe in meritocracy. Everybody is helping their own and birds of a feather fly together. Except white birds, that fly in different directions. Each one of them is alone and faces life alone.Our lack of clannishness has a long history. The Catholic church forbade cousin marriage so the tribes disappeared much earlier than in other societies. Then feudalism and capitalism destroyed the extended family. The Enlightenment produced an individualistic philosophy that guided our individualistic politics and so on.The fact is that, if you are born non-White, you have help. If you are born White, you have to face life alone. Here in El Salvador, people that want to illegally emigrate to the US are not alone. First, if they have kids, they can leave their kids with their family, sometimes for years (“arrimados” call these kids and I don’t find a good English translation). Then, when they get to the US, a family or a friend lets them live in their home until they can get their own place. You are not alone.When I was living in Dominican Republic, some decades ago, the owner of the house where I was living (a Mulatto woman) saw me suffering and she wanted to help me. She knew a man from my country (Spain, in Europe) and told him “I know a Spanish boy”, thinking that this guy was going to help me because we were from the same country. In fact, Dominican people help each other in a foreign country. His response: “There are a lot of Spanish people”, in a deprecatory manner.I have seen people helping each other but not among whites. Peruvians hire other Peruvians. Jews hire Jews. Indians hire Indians. Latin American help each other. In Spain, Chinese people don’t use banks: they lend each other. They don’t buy in Spanish shops. They buy to each other. Muslim people protect each other.Only us! We are a race of supermen, who don’t need help and are proud of flying alone. While we brag about our superiority, we are being conquered and slaved but we relish in our pride. Other people kick our ass mercilessly.And this is the cause of the Jewish success. They were the only non-Western people that lived among us for longtime. While we were flying alone, they were flying together. I have seen in this kind of blogs criticizing Jews because his first thought is always “What is good for the Jews?” But this is a virtue, not a vice. Instead of leaving your brother alone, helping each other is a virtue and everybody has it except us. And this is why we are being conquered and subjugated in our own countries, without a bullet being shot.

            The Church’s eugenics experiment in banning consanguineous marriages is an interesting story. The idea behind it was apparently to try and cut down on the amount of internecine warfare going on between the various clans and tribes of early medieval Europe, but the ultimate end-result, ironically, was to allow Europeans to create cohesive armies on a previously unimaginable scale (since the individual soldiers could extend their sense of trust beyond clan boundaries and cooperate with others who were not direct blood relatives).

            Ugh. See my comment below on selection bias. It is a categorical error to compare Askenazi (a non-randomly selected group) IQ to White (a much more randomly selected group) IQ. It’s like trying to draw some statistically meaningful conclusion by comparing a sample of apples to a sample of all other fruits.Are NFL players (a non-randomly selected group) faster than Whites? Are NFL players faster than Blacks? Than Asians? Than mammals in general?Are NBA players (a non-randomly selected group) taller than Whites? Than Blacks? Than Asians?You can’t draw any statistically significant conclusions from a comparison between a non-randomized sample group that is selected for one specific trait and a second sample group that is significantly less randomized.Everyone should read, or at least skim, the book How to Lie with Statistics.

            Excellent post. This has definitely been our biggest weakness. If there’s one thing we desperately need to change it’s our lack of identity and solidarity.
It does seem like things are finally starting to move in the right direction on that front though. Hopefully that will continue to increase exponentially and does not become “too little too late”. I think we have a decent chance, especially if economic and social conditions continue to deteriorate at the current, blindingly fast, rate.
Come on froggy, jump out of the pot! You can do it!

        I don’t think anyone was denying that Ashkenazi goblins have high average IQs, the two main points of contention were denying the claimed 15 size of the gap and that the gap proved a merit-based explanation for goblin dominance in careers that lead to wealth and power.The 15 point claim would make the gap between goblins and men as great as the gap between men and orcs, and to my understanding was based on a cherry-picked sample group of private school students.The problem with using IQ as an explanation of how goblins are successful is simply that of population size.  Even if white people are only average in intelligence (although when you separate Northern Europeans from the Catholics and Slavs you get 105 averages)  there are (were) still far more of them than Jews.  The outlier high IQ white boys should still outnumber the high IQ Jews, but that isn’t reflected in who ends up getting the competitive college admissions and careers.What the IQ fetishists like Juden Peterstein are really doing is trying to prove the myth that we live in a merit-based democracy where smart people end up in a station in life befitting their ability.  In reality the avenues to prestige and power are just as nepotistic they ever were in human history, either you’re born into a caste that hold aristocratic power or you suck a bushel of elite pee pees hoping to get let into the club.Ultimately IQ is a waste of time, the only real important component being the proportion of people you have in the 80-90 criminal zone.  Jewish verbal IQ and Chinese math IQ haven’t resulted in either group being able to create societies in which anyone would want to live.  In both cases temperament seems to be more salient: the Chinaman’s bug-like conformism producing 1984-esque dystopia and the Goblin Jew’s paranoid misanthropy and perversion producing anarcho-tyrannical societies like a Clockwork Orange.  Only the Northern European’s high social trust creates a positive environment where honest people can dance around maypoles and eat lutefisk in peace.

        The elephant in the room is that much of what makes Western Civ great is that it developed in a high-trust society, not a tribal society. Vastly larger demographics than what a tribe can deal with effectively. While large differences, like French vs. German required a smaller degree of inter-group trust, it was still massively more trust than one could extend to Africans or ME, or even Iberian peninsula natives. (Admittedly, the Iberians might be a special case — the Roman influences had been beaten out of them by centuries of Moor occupation.)Tribalism is an answer to tribal invasion, but requires a rejection of what made us the civilizational powerhouse we are, high-trust people. Seems to me a much better answer is the one that’s worked every time it’s been tried — freedom of association. You Frenchies live in France, Germans in Germany, etc. Like John Winger said, Americans are mutts, kicked out of every decent country in the world. And now with a whole bunch from the less decent countries.Most of our relationships are with our neighbors, who we can trust without reverting to tribe, and when dealing with people further removed from your culture, you afford them less trust.

            “what makes Western Civ great is that it developed in a high-trust society, not a tribal society.”The theme of Tragedy and Hope is that Western civ is in crisis and must reform and reorganize itself around its foundational principles to survive. Quigley calls them ‘inclusive diversity’ iirc. This was a man of the old left, not a DIE man. The high-trust thing, I suspect, is very similar to his idea.I generally agree with him, yet imo DIE proves we’ve gone wrong, or too far. I think we’ve reached some kind of limit that calls for some old-school conservatism.Any rate, I just found that’s pretty good, but the spam blocker is blocking. stpeter.im/journal/662.html

                Different direction than I was headed.I was just getting at how Western society is based on being able to take a man at his word, maybe a handshake if it’s something really important That may be a part of some other cultures, but strong in a Christian culture, with His own “But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.”But high-trust does not work at all in a society where cheating is acceptable, even praised when done to a member of the out-group. Even allowing those individuals to interact with your high-trust community poisons it.

                    It was a mixed blessing but widespread consanguineous marriage is a general negative for society. Unfortunately, the Church did not hold the royal families to the strict standard it held others, supposedly to help keep the peace in Europe. It actually had the opposite effect, with inbreeding not only weakening the royal lines but creating large numbers of people with plausible familial claims to thrones and titles with warfare among them the result.

        Every time this argument comes up it gives me the opportunity to refresh my mind on the numbers. Back of the envelope, generally taking the most unfavorable numbers for the majority population and most favorable for the minority of interest in US…334,900,00 x 0.58.9 ~ 197,000,000.31,000,000 above 1154,900,000 above 130295,000 above 1457,600,0002,400,000 above 115547,000 above 13053,000 above 145Basic rule of thumb is there is an order of magnitude more Ws at a given IQ cadre than  Js and therefore one can safely exclude IQ based merit arguments to explain overrepresentation in a given population of interest, like the cabinet of the current administration for example.

        If the jews are smart, good for them. It’s really beside the point.There was a time in my life when I lived around, worked with, socialized with a lot of urban ashkenazi. From that experience I can tell you that nothing about White Rural Rage is new, novel, or unusual. I heard the same sentiments from them on a very regular basis, years before the Orange Man came along. They have always feared, loathed, and othered rural whites. That’s been their bogeyman since long before I was born. And that’s the issue. Not how intelligent they are or aren’t. Their intelligence, clannishness, and ability to consolidate their ethnic power just makes their pogrom against rural whites that much more effective.

                Yeah, it was a real eye opener for me, after being raised in a very zionist southern protestantism, to see what the ashkenazi really thought of us. It was then that I realized that, owing to the color of my skin and my state of origin, there was nothing I could ever do (short of a sex change operation) to gain favor with them. Part of my journey to the DR.

                    Our experiences are different, then. I’m a white guy from West Texas, and with virtually no exception, have always been treated very well by the Finkels. I’m not making a NAXALT argument in their favor, simply relating what I have experienced and noting that when we separate from them–as we must–I will feel a touch of wistfulness.

                        It should be noted that I didn’t have this experience with them until I lived in a place where they were highly concentrated. Maybe you could say their true selves kind of come out more when they have the safety of the herd. At the same time, this didn’t preclude individual friendships

                    I suspect it’s true. My senses tell me the same thing. People of my parent’s age are very pro-Israel. People my age are more or less indifferent, at least WRT the elders. There are just more pressing matters. People my kids’ age are overwhelmingly opposed, as I witnessed recently when the church elders decided to invite in a Jewish speaker to talk about O7 (?) and probably a third of the younger (less than 30 YO roughly) people walked out, and many have not returned.

                        No, like I said, I’m more or less indifferent. Jews are not my people, neither are Gazans. Why would I walk out? To demonstrate that I care one way or the other?
I was running the livestream, so I mangled the audio beyond recognition and garbled his visuals. All there was going out was a clear vid of him speaking, but the sound was worse than Charlie Brown’s teacher.
Better than walking out, even if I were so inclined.

                        Again, indifferent. Even if I were so inclined, that would have been taking a side in something I have slightly less than no interest in. But if I were so inclined, I’d have probably done something like splice in some Hamas guy talking about why the paraglider thing was justified.

        I read the Bell Curve in 1996, and it was a solid book.  I believed it then and I believe it now.  And what did I see while I was reading that book?  The top performers in my college math classes being the Hebrews and East Asians.  There’s nothing wrong with that.  None of those people can run a 40 yard dash in five seconds like a well bred knob head.  Jimmy the Greek was vaporized from society for saying that.   And that was in the 80s!  Supposedly the pre-woke decade.  None of them would have turned the ladies heads either.  I hope they made a lot of money to compensate.One of the defining moments of my life was a class discussion, the same year, in which I brought this book up, and was immediately shouted down by harpies (why do we attempt to educate women?) for even bringing it up.  I may as well have brought a copy of The Satanic Verses into a mosque.  The professor was stony silent and just moved the class along.  Today I would probably have been turned in to some EEO politburo if that had happened.What everyone now calls “wokeness” didn’t just spring out of a box when Obama was elected.  This has been festering for decades.

        There’s an important point almost hidden in there.Back when the dread “alt right” was a thing, the handful of American leftists who are serious people, inheritors of an intellectual tradition rather than partisans of the left-branded establishment, dismissed these suddenly newsworthy nazi characters as “racist liberals.” The events of 2020-1 proved this correct. The nerd form of JQ enthusiasm proves it as well, though not I think in the way Z says. It’s conservatism, the “Burkean” liberal kind. Hierarchy is presumed innocent. Jewish dominance, if present, is a calculable error.There is a divide among the racist-lib right, though I don’t think it’s very significant.As Brexit &amp; Trump became covid &amp; coups, the WASP-nostalgia right, e.g. Spencer and Sailer, reverted to partisanship. They’re *just* Democrats now. Their take on the JQ (and everything else) is: You’re a loser. Look at this chart.As 2024 unfolds and *what the system even is* becomes increasingly unclear, the *other* racist liberals, “former libertarian” conversos and such, desperately scan the landscape for leadership, lately from the “Paypal mafia,” Elon and Thiel and Thiel’s pets like Vivek. Their take: Jewish dominance is an error. Look at this chart, Elon and Thiel, and save us from it (to whatever degree you wish). Also, you’re a loser, all other readers of this chart, especially if you doubt the immanent necessity of the Paypal Shitlib Reich, which like corporate globohomo will be ruled by Jews and pajeets—and maybe also by me, if I can get noticed early like Moldbug did.I say the difference is insignificant because what they share is fundamental: They, like the Jews on their charts, are, before and above anything else, enemies of *you*, statistically normal white person.

            RURAL is more or less “look, a squirrel!” People and tribes use the same weapons that worked until the day comes that they don’t work. Rural whites aren’t the ones conducting the ethnic cleansing of Gazans, and while most of them continue to support Our Greatest Ally, that number also is dwindling.

            It is a curious move for a super-intelligent person to make. You have Krugman piling on. At the same time, you have Michael Moore’s incredible tirade. Apparently he argued that rather than bomb the Gazans the real enemy are white Christians who have been persecuting Jews for 2000+ years. My how far he came from the champion of rust-belt America. It was quite vicious what he is proposing – and quite remarkable given where the guns they would point away from Gaza and toward us come from.When 10/7 happened it was obvious to the intelligent that a gollum was getting out of control. There was/is a choice that needs to be made. Do you continue with piling on whitey and trust that your brown coalition that you’ve raised against him sees you as another victim of whitey? Or, do you put down the grudge against whitey and cast your lot with him and then preserve and bolster that majority? That doesn’t even consider the coalition having ideas of their own and you needing to feed them ever more power and influence in your endless bargain.It seems for now, the verdict is an overwhelming vote to stay against whitey and remain in the Camp of The Saints.Perhaps that is ingenius and going to carry the day. Or, maybe it is pretty smart and whitey will continue to flounder and, the CoTS coalition will be happily subordinate; resulting in a double lucky break.In any case this book, Krugman’s constant wailing about America’s “white ethnic problem”, and Moore’s tirade are interesting developments. Whatever the case may be, whites need to wake up and tribe up or they are doomed. It is never good when every minority is permitted to demonize you, tear down all of your cultural relics and transmission mechanisms and at the same time advocate for your annihilation. Heck, the world’s most powerful company gave the entire world a glimpse of a past and a future without you. It is so remarkable I don’t think even the most astute truly can appreciate how radical and how vicious of a move that is.It seems true that non-whites see whites as a problem that must be eradicated. They say it every day. That means whites do have a problem and they better get with it and mount a viable defense.

        While the HBD discussion is interesting and important, but it is also a distraction from a another pertinent issue: identity.  The fact is that whether we like it or not identity groups exist.  Why should any identity group allow itself to be ruled by another identity group which will be suspected of being hostile?  How can two identity groups be on the same jury and met out justice for an inter-group crime that is satisfactory for both groups?  The fact is that the concept of diversity is a failure in the abstract.  You don’t even need to get into the specifics of which group is more intelligient than another, or which group more violent, impulsive, cooperative, open-minded, or any of the other dimensions of the human personality.

            “Why should any identity group allow itself to be ruled by another identity group which will be suspected of being hostile?”Because one identity group seems to have an inherent desire to be pawns in another group’s chess game.When I was in 6th grade and we were on a school trip, I played a game of battleship against an Armenian (Christian) kid. He started guessing several of my ship’s positions without getting any wrong. And that’s when I realized another friend kept looking at my ships and passing the information to the Armenian.This other friend was a Jew. And I’ve seen this dynamic play out over and over again…Christians at large just love being servants to Jews. Look at the Kardashians, another family of Armenian Christians. They’re very close friends with Joe Francis, the jewish founder of Girls Gone Wild.When you look at the PUA and manosphere, one can draw an intellectual line from jewish creeps like Neil Strauss and Robert Greene to Roosh Valizadesh (who is Armenian).I LOL’ed at Israel funding Azerbeijan’s war against Armenia. The chess king sacrifices his own pawns. Christians are such fools for their jew-cucking. Clowns worship the Jewish God and don’t mind when God’s Chosen Ones treat them like dirt.Jews derogatorily refer to Christians as goys. I find it offensive, the level of disdain so eagerly displayed. But look at the behavior of Christians, they willing behave like good little goys.Like good ole Jordan Peterson, eagerly licking the boots of his paymaster Ben Shapiro.

            And, I dare say, Finkels and heauxmeaux are the two most neurotic groups on earth. Does mental instability correlate with intelligence, or is there something else about those two groups that make them a little but nutty? (In the case of heauxmeaux, I’m certain their sexual orientation is itself a neurosis if not a psychosis.)

        Zman – Seems to me you are conflating many things here – ‘intelligence’ as produced by genetics and measured by IQ tests,  environmental factors, social mores, in-group preference, and minority-majority relations.  Many other commenters have already raised these points and more; I shall try not to repeat them in depth but perhaps summarize.  But you also start out writing about “IQ denialism” and then conclude with “immutable” human differences.  These are two very different things.I know you are wise enough not to confuse “different” with necessarily better or worse, but you have also written quite pointedly about the legitimacy of making value judgments – which is first noticing those immutable differences and then making a judgment about one thing being superior to another.  You have also written that one needn’t “justify” why one has a preference at all.  And yet here you seem to be arguing that having a preference for one’s own people, as well as adjudging other people to be “less than” (smart or creative or honest) is some sort of cope.So, where to start?  As some already noted, most studies do not clearly define “White.”  I was sharing that Rasmussen study on the 1% with my husband yesterday, and nowhere did it break out how many were Jews (or “whiter” Arabs or Mestizos or Subcons).  Simply based on student demographics at those 12 colleges he lists, I would guess a fairly substantial number.  Not to mention that how many administrators, admissions officers, professors, etc. at those colleges are also “fellow Whites”  who control the narrative and help shape the worldview of so many gullible students.  And yes, it does matter – at the very minimum to those “fellow Whites” themselves, if not yet to many Whites who remain stubbornly oblivious to group genetic differences.As also already noted, there are significant group differences between verbal dexterity, visual-spatial ability, and creativity.  And, of course, character traits (again heavily genetic) such as doggedness, and cultural values such as literacy and memorization.  Add in clannishness, a degree of paranoia, cultural alienation, etc.All that being said:  Your post immediately brought to mind a comment by Sailer’s    self-proclaimed resident expert on most things, but especially all things Jewish.  As an aside, note I have not actually read a Sailer post in years – but I do skim the comments, just as I skim comments at YT channels I don’t watch.  One finds all sorts of interesting links and information in comments.  Anyhow, yesterday from Sailer’s comments:“This is the difference between the Left and the Right – the Left hates Jews because they are white and the Right hates Jews because they are not white. However, they both agree that Jews are bad.What all types of antisemitism have in common is that the Jew is always the Other – the living antithesis of that which you cherish. What you cherish most may be different to different groups and at different times and in different places but the Jew is always the opposite of it. This is the reason that Jews are blamed for being both capitalists and communists, for being rootless cosmopolitans and excessive parochial, etc. Whatever you think of as bad, that’s what you project upon the Jews so that you and your people are without sin. This operates literally in the same way as the scapegoat did in Biblical times except that the Israelites used an actual goat and understood that casting their sins upon it was metaphorical and not to be taken literally.”Yet again – the Jews are the self-proclaimed scapegoat of the world.  I looked in vain yesterday for an English word representing that special blend of solipsism and lack of self-awareness; oblivious doesn’t come close.  Perhaps Karl Horst knows a German term that would do the job.  But again, note:  Utter lack of any fault on the Jews’ part, zero differentiation among times and nations – simply “We are blameless victims due to projection and unthinking hatred of the ‘other.’  Simultaneous with “We are special and different and to be asked to abandon our differentness is hatred and genocide (hmmn, brings to mind POX statements about race, and we know who founded and funded most POX organizations in AINO).  And, while being special and different, this Sailer commenter then whines:“The American bargain traditionally was that you would keep SOME of your culture in exchange for acceptance . . .  – a hybrid identity.”He actually, in all seriousness, uses the example of a rabbi “bending over backwards” to find a way for Coca Cola to change its formula to comport with Jewish dietary laws so Jews could drink it and yet remain special and different as Jews – something he describes as a “win-win.”  Gee, at  most 2% of the population and a major corporation has to change to suit the cultural habits of a tiny minority, and this is the “bargain” he describes as “assimilation.”  Not quite my definition, needless to say.In conclusion, this Jewish commenter mournfully intones:“The great tragedy of European history was that Jews were not accepted as a European race. Had they been, then the Holocaust would not have happened, it would not have been necessary to re-found a Jewish state in the Middle East, etc. So much tragedy and strife has resulted from the European failure to see Jews as their brothers and sisters.”There you have it in a nutshell, folks:  They are different and special and yet the same and all the problems throughout history and across the globe are solely due to White Europeans refusing to accept this contradiction as both rational and real and heaven-ordained.   The universal brotherhood of man, kumbaya, but never forget, “Is it good for the Jews?”And to conclude my very overlong post, I give you Franklin Foer at the Atlantic, mourning the end of the Jews’ “golden age” in America.https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/04/us-anti-semitism-jewish-american-safety/677469/Just like Sailer’s commenter, Foer notes just how much Jews changed America and conflated being Jewish with being American.  Then he laments how all the anti-colonialism and anti-Whiteness (heavily fomented by Jews, of course) has now redounded upon the Jews themselves.  It’s all of a piece – read it and reflect on just how much it echoes Sailer’s Jewish commenter  (hmmn again – ((())).  I know, I’m just looking for conspiracy theories when I notice patterns.America – what a country.  “The most comfortable homeland in the Jewish diaspora.”  That’s White privilege, folks.  All those evil slave-owning Southern planters, all those who stole Indian land, all those seething rural White racists – they had no culture or traditions or nation or history or people of their own.  They merely had the great luck to furnish the Jews with a “comfortable” stopping place.  A convenient way point.And somehow I’m supposed to be bothered that some people disagree about various cherry-picked data?  A few IQ points here or there totally account for Jewish success in America.  Because America, like the rest of the world, was created to provide comfort and succor to the Jews.  So never forget your prime purpose, Goyim.  As Sailer’s commenter disingenuously notes, “Goyim is just the Hebrew/Yiddish word for Gentiles and it has entered common use in America . . . (Literally speaking it means “nations”, as in the “nations of the earth”. )”

            Cattle by any other name…Great comment. I am ashamed to admit that when I read that mind-blowing exploration of Rasmussen’s poll, WHO comprised the subject one percent did not occur to me at all but that obviously is key. Liberty, justice, conservation, and even concepts such as “free speech” truly are exclusively white phenomena. Politics, government and society at large reflects biology, and they all are starting to reflect its changed nature good and hard.The Foer piece was simultaneously infuriating and hilarious. It also is a white pill of sorts, is it not? The destroyers will be part of their destruction. He’s correct there, not that we won’t live in ruins.

        We have to look at ourselves for the answers. We have the resources. From the wheel, the chariot, the superior breed of horse, to global navigation to cathedrals and fugues to philosophy and law to sattelites to sub-oceanic cables to TCP/IP networks to global scale energy, transporation, communications systems to the hubble telescope to the periodic table of elements and on and on and on  we are clearly capable.We need to look inward and summon the will to assert ourselves. We need to tribe up. Clearly other groups have avarice and are marshalling malicious intent as evidenced by our ongoing dispossession. Individual intellects no matter how towering will not succeed without strong support networks, a common good, common goals and a single or set of Sorelian myths to which we are striving.We have all we need in terms of raw material. We need a collective will and vision and to remember that we are a tribe that will rise and fall together. We’ve done it before let’s do it again. All of the other debates are just wasting time away while we lose our homelands, a clearly invaluable asset. We are a people these are our lands and we are unafraid to claim them and act morally to make good on those claims.

        A morsel to contemplate today–what happens when all the FOTB illegals realize that these nice Americans won’t do a darn thing to stop them from grabbing your little girl off the street, shoving Aunt Mary aside in the checkout line, punching little Billy on the school bus, pulling Grandad out of his car at the gas station and driving away with his vehicle etc. If there are no longer any well mannered examples to show illegals that this is how to behave here, nor to force them to behave when they step out of line, they will never learn. So we will get policemen, soldiers, street thugs etc who will behave exactly as they did in their home s–tholes.

Hint:  They will ‘never learn” because the vast majority cannot ever learn.  It’s just not in their nature to be “just like us.”  And for the rare few who might so manage – too bad so sad.  Their home sh*tholes are not due to lack of people to teach them to be better.  Genetics&gt;culture&gt;environment.   You might further reflect on cause and effect.

        I feel like parsing Jewish IQ is a distraction. The HBD/IQ crowd is very good at distractions. There are definitely a lot of intelligent Jews, who come out of the womb with an above-average IQ. Fine, but, in absolute numbers is it more than the number of above-average intelligent people of European descent? No way. So, the question is what happens after they come out of the womb. Well, they are also schooled in a rigorous legalistic environment which includes constant discussion about the superiority of their own people and the endless animosity of the subhuman cattle who are not them. As a result, Jews look out for other Jews, who help each other out. The story of the 20th century, in many ways, was Jews stepping out of the ghetto they landed in from Ellis Island, linking up with other Jews in education and professional networks, helping each other along the way, and before you know it, they’re the elites. Are all Jews like that? In my observation, yes. For most Jews, the central focus point of their lives is their Jewish – their neighborhood, their kids’ schools, their social circles, their charitable contributions, etc. They help each other out and look out for each other. And, you know what, in theory I have no problem with that. People should be able to live their lives the way they want. Except that we are outlawed from doing the exact same thing. So far, the story of the 21st century appears to be White people being actively discriminated against in hiring, in college admissions, in promotion, and simply being unable to access any sort of network that could help them along.

        My feelings toward Jews is a product of the discovery that Jews usurped the accomplishments of a heroic Founding Father, Robert Morris, attributing them instead to one of his minions – a Polish Jew named Hyam Salomon. They continue to promulgate this myth, despite it having been debunked by University of Pennsylvania historian Beth S. Wenger, herself a Jew, in her book “History Lessons: The Creation of American Jewish Heritage.” As recently as 2017, an article in Time magazine repeated the claim that Hyam Salomon left Yom Kipper services to assist George Washington in raising funds to help the starving soldiers at Valley Forge, a myth for which there is no proof. This story is contained in children’s books and other material available in the Jewish subculture, along with the claim that Salomon’s heirs were spurned by the United States government when they attempted to collect on the debt they felt they were due. To what extent this false version of history has influenced Jewish attitudes towards their host nation is unknown.https://time.com/4958652/yom-kippur-george-washington-history/

            I only vaguely alluded to it in my comment when I mentioned black inventors but seemingly every crowning achievement done by a jew has some story of fraud like this trailing it. This is a group of people well known for lying their asses off &amp; rewriting history so I naturally view all of these allegedly brilliant jews with heavy skepticism.There’s always been a thick ever present cloud of pathological deceit surrounding these people so it seems crazy to me to suddenly ignore that &amp; blindly accept mainstream sources when it comes to their intelligence &amp; achievements.Thanks for posting this by the way, I’ve encountered many examples like this but I had not heard of this particular example before.

                There was or is an article up on unz showing everything attributed to Einstein was already known and published at the time of his publishing them.  They had links to wikipedia articles of the papers that came out before his supposed discoveries. I had it bookmarked, but I cannot find it anymore.  Perhaps it was wrong and they retracted it, I don’t really know.  But he was entirely a creation of the media.  It is no accident that just about every single American knows who he was.There are many, many, many far more important men than Einstein (even if everything attributed to him is truly his discovery) who almost nobody knows that have had FAR bigger impacts on life around the planet.  There are things you touch every single day where not a Jew was to be found in the history of that thing.Jews love to write themselves into our history and make heroes of themselves and are remarkably good at it, largely through their control of the media.

        Ashkenazi jews may have a high average IQ but how much of that high IQ is derived from jewish genes? You don’t see quadroons being hailed as brilliant africans the same way these heavily Euro mixed jews routinely are, it’s a lie by omission.Its hard to take the claim seriously when so many of them are obviously morons who only got accepted to ivy league schools &amp; hold positions of power solely because of nepotism.Every facet of this claim seemingly has has an asterisk next to it the same way brilliant sub saharan africans do. Leftists always love to point out blacks invented this &amp; that yet these achievements only ever occurred outside their own countries. How many brilliant jews existed independent of European societies?Regardless of their intelligence jews were only allowed to ascend because enough of the post civil war ruling class shared similar views to them even though the underlying motivations between them were wildly different. Jews never actually believed in equality, that was just a means to an end. Meanwhile the northern liberals really wanted to make that coexist bumper sticker a reality. That’s why you don’t see these brilliant jews subverting primitive arabs into into becoming tranny loving degenerates, intelligence isn’t a factor in that at all.Jewish power in the West is a product of complicit Whites, even their vaunted intelligence is a result of Whites allowing them to exist in their societies throughout the ages. When you get down to it they’re ultimately a symptom of the White man’s maladaptive tendency to be charitable to those who don’t deserve it.

        “this is the great struggle of this age. On the one hand is the reality of the human condition and on the other is the liberal assumptions about the human condition, which are crashing into biological reality”I agree that this is the great struggle.  Rarely have I seen it put so clearly in recent years, anywhere.  We’re watching the western establishments, including governments, educational systems, and media, crashing upon those rocks of reality again and again, while they manage to drown the rest of us who warn about the rocks, and who point to where the safe harbour is.  Their ship is a large, sturdy one that was built, not by them, but by much better men, and it’s taking a while to sink.I suppose that such rigid denial of basic truths is one of the reasons for the widespread mental illness and despair that seems so prevalent now.  It’s a sufficient cause to badly mess up people’s minds.  Mix it in with the official approval and encouragement of unhealthy, evil behavior, the loss of so many steady jobs, the continual bashing of one’s race and culture and history, and the promotion of alien people and culture, the avoidance of basic law enforcement, and this mix will have a huge mental and spiritual effect.  I guess that won’t surprise many here.  I’ll also say that “clinging” to my heritage that our ancestors gave us, in books, etc., and getting out into nature, are among the things that help me the most.I’d like to put in a good word for “Academic Agent” though.  I haven’t seen the specific piece on the Ashkenazi, but I’ve seen some interesting work that seems good which he has done on the Frankfurt School and Denazification, and on the decline of western culture.  Some of his videos on topics such as Tennessee Ernie Ford, Trumpton, etc., are unforgettable.  I believe he is mixed Iranian/British.  I haven’t closely followed him all the time, but, well, we can’t be right all the time.

            AA has some brilliant takes. He had a thought-provoking piece recently that argued that all ideology is post-hoc rationalization to justify the powerful’s grip on society. That set off the Counter-Currents types who despite all the evidence to the contrary believe arguments and persuasion can effect change. It is a reminder of the line from Upton Sinclair about changing minds at the risk of a paycheck. Of course, Mao cut to the chase long ago.
I haven’t read the piece Z linked but will do so.

                Yes, I saw that there was a debate or conflict between AA and Keith Woods about the nature of ideology and power.  I didn’t follow it yet either but it might be interesting.
I enjoyed AA’s justified disdain in one video for the Iranian leftist revolutionaries, university-educated in Paris and elsewhere, who got outsmarted by the mullahs in the 1980’s.  The survivors whined that this wasn’t how the revolution was supposed to go.  AA said something like, “had they never read a history book, in all their glorified education?!”

                    I highly recommend you check out the Woods/CC podcast on the subject. It is fascinating. I shouldn’t be so cynical, to be fair, because they sound like they really believe what they say and are very sharp in their rebuttal. Still, it is nothing but a more intelligent version of conservatives with charts and grafts convinced they will show the Left the error of their ways.

                        Jack:  One of many reasons (aside from being banned) that I stopped reading Counter Currents.  Just as with people, I am fairly quick to jettison websites that ultimately waste my time.  I’m too old to engage to useless mental masturbation.  Either something works – as demonstrated by reality and history – or it doesn’t.  Talking about it isn’t going to change that.

            Academic Agent’s book “The Populist Delusion” should be required reading by anyone who reads Zman.  Fantastic take on why populism never works and why you probably don’t want it to.
“Prophets of Doom” is another great one.  Summarizes the writings of great history-is-cyclical thinkers.
His real name is Neema Parvini.  His youtube channel generally runs into the “too long” category, but his writing in the aforementioned books is fantastic.
(He’s British, but of Iranian descent.  I don’t think he’s a fan of Zionists or the GAE American rainbow dido empire, at all.)

        “If the parsimonious explanation for Jewish success is high intelligence, plus things like Jewish culture and clannishness, why are some antisemites determined to “debunk” the claim that Jews are smart?”I’m unaware of anyone who thinks they don’t have a higher IQ than White people, just that it is probably not 115 and more like 106-108.“In other words, the reason the antisemites keep attacking the Jewish IQ stuff is they associate intelligence with good things, but they cannot allow their enemy to have good qualities, so they have no choice but to strip this from their enemy.”I really don’t get this impulse in people.  IQ says absolutely nothing about the worth or moral worth of a person. It says nothing about their character or the desirability of them being your neighbor.  Half the population is below average.Instead of ranting against Jewish IQ, they should be using them as the example of why IQ nationalism and importing 3rd world PHDs is utterly retarded and bound to create an unhappy and dysfunctional society.

            If there is a more dysfunctional white society than Israel, who? Mental problems are highly correlated with higher IQs. I have suspected that Jewish society has an hysterical edge that erupts on occasion. We’re seeing this is Israel right now. These people are so smart, they’re going to get themselves destroyed.

        “Personality traits, culture and dumb luck all play a role in the success of a person. ”You forgot nepotism.How “smart” jews are is irrelevant.  It doesn’t justify their clear motivation for screwing up every single thing they set their eyes upon.  The US was doing just fine before these people started arriving by the boat load.Is the US doing better or worse since letting these people take over our institutions?The problem with IQ worshipers is they blindly believe high IQ automatically equals high morality, honesty, and or integrity as well.And if Israel is so smart they don’t need billions of dollars from us dumb goys to prop up their fake country.

            &gt; The problem with IQ worshipers is they blindly believe high IQ automatically equals high morality, honesty, and or integrity as well.
A low population group with high IQ along with extreme nepotism and neuroticism for outsiders will always wreak havoc with the host country. The only feasible solutions are to ship them to their own country or breed them out of existence. The latter is slowly but surely happening with the High IQ cohort with low birth rates and low intermarriage rates.

                Chet:  Check the number of 1/4 Jews in Hollywood and Academia who are on record as spurning their Whiteness.  Just like Mestizos such as Jessica Alba (72% White) and various mixed-race joggers.  Intermarriage and interbreeding do not, historically, produce harmony.  Ask the various groups of former Yugoslavia.
People naturally seek an identity and a home group – a tribe.  For 99% of mixed anything, their tribe is non-White.  There are a number of fairly prominent people in England with 1/8 Jewish ancestry.  They don’t tend to concern themselves with the primacy and welfare of the heritage English population.

            The US was doing just fine before these people started arriving by the boat load.For selected values of “fine”.It’s the same problem I have discussing things with right-libertarians. The Constitution of 1789 (or possibly with the Bill of Rights of 1791) is the right-libertarian wet dream. Most only want a little change here or there, and it would be “perfect”. OK, so how did it go from Libertarian Nirvana to imprisoning political prisoners (not J6 — good guess, but I’m talking the Sedition Act of 1798 and several other “Federalist” innovations), and more importantly,how do you prevent that next go around?The “flaws” of the Articles of Confederation were largely that they constrained the moneyed interests from running roughshod over the people to the extent they wanted to. Not Jewish moneyed interests, they were almost completely Anglo-Saxons. Jews may have made it worse, sure, but my reading of history is that some fraction of intelligent men are just vicious bastards, no matter what race. And smart, vicious bastards are a real challenge.

        The previous comments about blacks from the cab driver in St Louis are true.As for Jews we can learn a lot from SolzehnitznHe was neither Philo Jewish or Antisemitic.Solzehnitzn was a proud ethnic Russian willing to praise or criticize the Jew as shown in his book 200 years together. Of course some Jews criticized him no matter what Solzenitzn did or his attitude toward them, we are just going to always have that aspect of our relationship with the Jews.with us.We need to focus on building.Build our thing as this one collapses.That is what white men do best

I saw Vox Day in your line up of references and laughed – he has his hands full studying comic books. He poses as a social influencer and he has limited traction with the cellar dwelling soy boys… are the other sources you listed as credible as Vox Day? If so…we obviously won’t have the knowledge base required for an informed debate.I don’t think we are even capable of conducting statistically valid studies anymore.

            People who read comics vote.  Kids who read comics grow up to be members of society and some will be in influential or leadership positions.  There is a reason SJWs took over comics.  People like to throw shade at VD for doing the comics, but he has influence in that world now. He’s helping create culture.  There are probably hundreds of dissident books nobody reads.What is it with this silly attitude towards this stuff?  We need a 100 more Vox Days in various sub-groups influencing culture in various ways.He’s also working in the opposite end of the spectrum creating leather bound books.Admittedly, I am a fan of VD, but even if I wasn’t, that would be the last criticism I would throw at him.

I am more put off by his personalizing and monetizing everything (his own wikipedia, his own twitter, his own this and that fan club).  It’s boringly solipsistic.  And it’s legitimate to question his allegiance to White, Western culture when he constantly goes on about how unfair Whites were to his (feather) Indian ancestors.  Boo hoo.

                    I don’t think most social media is financially viable other than smaller things like social galactic or even this blog.  Yes, he has created all these projects, but they weren’t done out of vanity, they were done because he, like most dissidents was kicked off the mainstream platforms.Wikipedia is entirely run by SJWs.The publishing industry, especially in fantasy and science fiction is 100% SJW captured and run.Youtube is SJW captured and run.Twitter (was) and to a great extent still is run by SJWs.The comics industry is the worst of the SJWs which of course is symbiotic with the movie companies. This is the culture creation I mentioned.I read yesterday M2 money supply went negative.  But surely money is getting tighter.  We will see what is viable what people are willing to pay for.  Social media has only existed during the bubble and almost all of them lose vast sums of money.  Can it survive a major recession or even just normal times?  Who knows. I guess we will find out in the not too distant future.  To the extent some SM companies survive, having to pay for it is probably the only way SM will ever have anything approaching “free speech”  “The product” has no say in what is permissible.  The actual customers have that power.  Right now, we’re the product, not the customer.The only social media I would even consider paying for is youtube.  Too much good stuff.  Like if your toilet is leaking and you don’t know the first thing about plumbing (like me), there’s like a thousand videos going over every aspect of toilet repair.  Same for every topic under the sun.

            Tribal people….extremely tribal people, along with a high IQ, especially a high verbal IQ, is a formula for domination.
Whites are extremely smart, creative and innovative, which is a great starting point for gaining power in a multiracial society. The missing ingredient is high ingroup preference.  Too much naivety and niceness.  Tribal is where it’s at.

        A few days ago I watched an interview of the two men who wrote ‘White Rural Rage.’ I had to laugh because these two gentlemen would not know how to function without rural Whites fixing everything.
It seems that these IQ tests do not measure intelligence, just how good you can take a test. I’ve mention before that I know a lot of high IQ, ‘brilliant’ people who cannot screw in a lightbulb, and not just on Saturday.

        No one who is numerate or empirical questions Ashkenazi  IQ. The JQ, however, is about influence, not intelligence.
Even if that influence is arguably merited in certain respects, that does not necessarily make it desirable.
This post has the feel of CYA.

            What you don’t seem to grasp, is Jewish intelligence is a primary reason they are able to exercise so much influence.Their dominance in spheres of influence is because of their dominance of the banking system, financial markets, the media, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly “the law.” Jews practically invented big business and corporatism.The best, lawyers are almost always Jewish. If it were only a matter of hard work, or perseverance, whites mostly those of WASP descent would be just as dominant in the realm of law. The legendary “Protestant work ethic.”Jews aren’t just higher I.Q.,  “book smart.”They have exceptional social intelligence, “the gift of gab, and Machiavellian tendencies.Most of the best comedians have always been Jewish.Jews have more than just an I.Q. edge. They are “the total package.”Non Jewish whites have an edge in applying intelligence to practical things like, engineering,  invention, iniovation,building physical things, exploration, physical strength, athletic competition.Everything the Jew does is money centric. Money equals power and influence.Not that non Jewish whites haven’t been successful in areas and fields, Jews excel in.Overall the Jews are just better, and in higher proportion to non Jews.

                You forget unmitigated gall or chutzpah in your calculations, Sir. When you have that unbridled ability to sink to any low, to plumb every depth, and explore every perversion without retraint regardless to beauty, morality, ethics, truth etc… you have a natural advantage over those that do not. You do however create a world where you sit as king of a decaying, fetid and corrupted world. Cleverness juxtaposed against wisdom.Politics, justice, art and music, medicine, media, psychology and science, architecture,entertainment, philosophy, charity… the Chosen control and sit as undisputed kings of modernity.But kings of what? A modern empire where the aforementioned things are reduced and perverted into public graft, legal trickery, rap music, genital mutilation, opioids, pornography, entertainment slop, NGO grifts, racial strife, atomization and the rift Our People suffer between their God, history, and ancestors.I lay most of, if not all of this, at the feet of the Tribe. It was their chutzpah and depravity that allowed them to triumph (for now) over their more restrained opponents. These kings of the garbage heap.

            Agreed.I personally believe its clannishness and culture, coupled with an intellect that is on par with our own. The figures I have seen show jews coming in less than a couple IQ points higher than whites or yellows. And of course, black IQ’s are what they are.Neoliberalism is only working based on artificial prosperity. Whitey is lazy and stupid because he can afford to be. He’s happy if the lights and heat are on, the plumbing works and there’s a good sportzball game on TV.When times are tough, the guns and jackboots come out and the jews are fun out of town or they go to the camps … and the blacks start shining shoes and singing for their supper.

        The studies which conclude that Ashkenazi Jews have higher IQs than other races are all classic examples of selection bias in statistical studies, which renders the studies invalid. They compare a decidely non-random sample (Askenazi Jews) against a far more random sample (e.g., Whites, Americans, Asians, etc.). To use a software metaphor, these are GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) studies.Question: Why do all these studies limit the population of Jews to the Ashkenazi? Answer: IQ studies in Israel seem to show that the Oriental Jews in Israel have an IQ that is approximately 14 points lower than Ashkenazi Jews, which places the Oriental Jews below most White or Asian populations.Question: Which “Whites” are they referring to in these studies? Answer: Who knows? Are Sicilian immigrants in the US White? Are Hispanics considered White, like in FBI crime statistics? Nobody knows, because the authors of the study don’t tell you the breakdown of the “others” against whom the Askenazi are being compared.Back in the day when America was ruled by WASPs, one could easily have constructed a study that compared the IQ of Jews (including Oriental Jews) to the IQ of ruling class WASPs and then drawn the false conclusion that “Whites” are smarter than “Jews”,  but that would have been equally false. These are all good examples of How to Lie with Statistics.

            “ Why do all these studies limit the population of Jews to the Ashkenazi? ”
The Ashkenazi is the tribe that spread to Europe and then to America.  The Sephardic stayed in the Middle East.  Studies/stat’s outside Europe and America are therefore more difficult, not some sort of conspiracy.
I can’t remember any specific exclusion of the knowledge of a general lower IQ due to non-Ashkenazi presence.  Indeed, just awhile ago I was reading an article illustrating Ashkenazi background in present Israeli leadership.  The implication being that even in Israel there is a (success) bias being Ashkenazi.

                It was the Mizrahim who stayed in the Middle East. The Sephardim hailed from the Iberian Peninsula. If the latter ended up in the area ruled by moslems, it was due to their 1492 expulsion from Spain. They, together with an unknown number ofconversos, also ended up in Latin America following Columbus’ unwitting discovery of the Americas that same year.

                There has been a fascinating amount of genetic mapping of the Ashkenazim. The short version is that they dramatically inbred with Europeans, particularly central Italians initially after the Romans expelled them, and this boosted IQ from what was typical for the original desert tribe. After a point they developed ingroup preferences. It probably isn’t wrong to say this led to a distinct ethnicity/race in many senses. In a way this is similar to the interbreeding of eastern coyotes with dogs that increased their size and made them distinct from the original western version, to use a very strained analogy.Much of the political unrest in Israel over the last few years has been due to the ascendancy of the dumber but more fertile Sephardic over the Ashkenazi’s. It almost can be seen as a racial or ethnic struggle. I don’t have a handy link, but Israelis are acutely aware of the IQ differences and have studied them extensively.

                    Jack:  I mentioned the other day a case of what I mistakenly thought was an Muslim in America killing another Muslim in America.  Based on both names and physiognomy, it seemed fairly self evident.  But later I read that I was wrong – it turned out to Muslim Arab killed Jewish Arab in America.  I don’t see a great deal of genetic distance between the two.

                I’m not sure I understand your comment.
A single study comparing a non-random sample (Askenazi Jews) to a far more random sample (e.g., White, Asian, etc.) is simply a flawed experiment. Multiple, repeated studies committing the same statistical error to draw the same flawed conclusions, which are then amplified continuously through the (((media))) is perhaps the best evidence of a conspiracy I have seen in decades.

As any “intelligent” Jewish judge will tell you, the Second Amendment only gives the police and the army the right to own guns, and James Madison’s First Amendment requires that interracial hardcore pornography must be legal, just as any “intelligent” Jewish professor will tell you that gender is fluid.The “intelligence” of the Jews has been dedicated to fleecing the goyim ever since Joseph got busted out of an Egyptian prison on an attempted rape charge and bulshitted the Pharaoh into letting him have control over the grain — which he then gave to his fellow jew brothers who had sold him into slavery.Did a Jewish comedian who played piano with his penis become Ukrainian head of state and get the U.S. to give him hundreds of billions in weapons because he is “intelligent” — or because his fellow tribesmen control the U.S. government?

            You’ve hit the nail on the head. Looks like someone wants to give us a little dust up of more alt-right drama since the West/Fuentes/Jones spectacle faded out. Cue stage left so we keep paying attention to the thinly veiled neo-reactionaryism.
Ever wonder why they all promoted a god-emperor and now anti-voting?
The answer is so you don’t rebuild how your institutions functioned many decades ago. Instead, give in and submit to the Peter Thiels of the world.

        No one gets to pick their parents, so blaming a Jew for their genetics (and all that goes with it) is asinine. In life, you play the hand you’re dealt, and that includes the specific nurturing you received from your parents. So the issue of average intelligence in any genetic cohort is a reality you are born with. Jews have a little boost and blacks have a little deficit, and there are outliers in all cohorts. Whatever God gave you, you must make the best of it.The bigger issue for the Jewish ethnicity is societal parasitism, which historically has been a problem in most places on the planet where Jews have migrated. For whatever reason, they tend to infect the local adopted community is much the same way as a virus infects a biological host. They tend to aggrandize power incrementally and then, as a result of sustained affluence, become degenerate and genuinely dangerous to the overall health of the host community. Pogroms were never a unjustified evil, but rather a last ditch effort to cleanse a debilitating infection.A simple, but hard truth.

            Yep, I don’t really care why Jews do so well. I care that they always end up being trouble in the countries where they live. I also care that they aren’t my people.

1. Keep them out of your country2. If they are in your country, get as much independence from them as possible.

            I agree with the overall sentiment, but not of the parasite comparison. As I’ve said before, I’ve seen the same analogy used to “prove” unborn babies are parasites in order to “justify” abortion/murder.
The social dysfunction argument is strong enough by itself already. Kept in neutral terms, it’s often persuasive all on it’s own. But once you overplay the hand, everyone starts interpreting you as Not-Sees, and you lose anyone who was open to considering it.

        Ed Dutton’s book “Making Sense of Race” devotes a chapter to “Race and the Jews.”  The average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews in the US and other Western countries is 112, and for linguistic IQ it’s 117, while Europeans score 100.
Dutton also reports on tests that measure ethnocentrism, which Jews score extremely high.  An example he points out is Israeli infants were tested and found to be much more likely become “inconsolably upset” in reaction to strangers, compared to North German infants who had relatively minor reactions to strangers.

            There is some writing now by HBD researchers wrt IQ decline, i.e., the reverse Flynn effect.  Interestingly, the Jews are not immune from such.  For example, they looked at certain markers, like young Jews in scholastic prominence and found a decline from a generation or so ago.  I don’t have references at hand, but it’s something to look for in future writings and research.  The era of touted Jewish IQ may be coming to an end.  Of course, as Z-man said, IQ is separate from clannishness and ethnocentrism, which also helps to explain prominence.  This most likely will not go away.

        Z-man should debate Vox Day on this subject…I would note that the same private school study that found a Jewish IQ of 115, also found that Northern Europeans in the school had an even higher IQ…The computer study of Harvard admissions, looking at SAT scores and grades, found that jews were 500% overrepresented, while asians were 33% underrepresented and whites 66% underrepresented…Jews promote jews, Hindus promote Hindus, that’s the main reason for their predominance in many spheres….But almost all scientific advances have been the product of white males, except for a brief period in the 20th century, which now appears to be passing…

            Ron Unz has done a lot of work on this.   He describes all of the data sets and all of the math.    Just one finding:  A white non-Jewish male with a given IQ vs a Jewish male with the same IQ in admittance to an elite school.     Neither with any legacy connections to further the entrance chance into those schools.Result:  The non-Jewish white male has a 1000% less chance to be chosen for entry.   With IQ difference eliminated you still get this result unless you question his research.    So it seems severe nepotism in the selection process is taking place.Now of the Jewish population how many are Ashkenazi?  I would not be surprised that they have a higher average IQ.   Are there enough of those that it randomly happens that they inhabit just about all of the power centers in the West?    Because many of the powerful Jews that we see in public make the stupidest statements you can imagine.  Yellen comes to mind.In any event, if an alien race arrived in America, took over the  institutions,  and were obviously attempting to destroy the West at every turn, would it matter that they had very high IQs?   That is literally what has happened.

If that’s true, it’s fair to ask if you can smart yourself beyond them, too. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the answer is clearly No.

        To bolster your point today, Victoria Nuland is slithering away, to the degree her fat ass can slither, from the cluster she created:
https://www.state.gov/on-the-retirement-of-under-secretary-of-state-for-political-affairs-victoria-nuland/
Just a reminder that crazy doesn’t preclude high intelligence. Yes, her resignation as an example is anecdotal, but still instructive. Perfect timing like this requires a high IQ and her Tribe has perfected jumping off sinking ships. Just because a person is repellent doesn’t mean they aren’t smart. For a good example check out the blogger you linked.

            My guess is she was forced out as the admin thinks about who to blame for what lies ahead. Not having this woman around, who could be called before Congress to testify in an official capacity, is part of the scheme to lay the blame at the feet of the Republicans in Congress.

                Aid to Ukraine is just another example of the pointlessness of the GOP. The WH wants the $60 billion to keep Ukr afloat until the elections.
Any real opposition party would flat out refuse, thus allowing Ukr to fall and help their election chances. But the GOP will end up giving them the money.
So pointless.

                    While dismissing the GOP as the “Stupid Party” deflects from its garbage tier corruption, it is indeed quite stupid. Don’t be surprised if that immediately after the GOP funnels sixty billion to Ukraine and the money flows to leftwing NGO’s and politicians “Biden” announces the start of peace negotiations.
I had thought/hoped with the elimination of BOM the GOP would end this cycle, but apparently enough elected Republicans want more grift and will keep him around a bit longer, and the Regime may want him as a fall guy.
Stupid will stagger on a while longer.

                    Miley was the first to go once it was clear the offensive was a failure. He was scheduled to expire anyway, so he probably exited to avoid getting blamed for it. The thing is, Nuland will be replaced by another cult member and the cult leaders will continue to call the shots.

        I have the same feeling toward Jewish IQ as I do Asian IQ or any other groups IQ. I don’t really care outside of how it impacts my people.Basically, Jews aren’t my people so I don’t want them in my society and if we’re forced to share a larger society, I want to avoid them as much as possible and for them to have as little control over my society as possible.Autonomy should be the goal of whites (or any white sub-group).==================================Now, as to the specific question of Jewish IQ, I’m with other commenters in that I do accept that Jews have a somewhat higher IQ than whites, let’s say 106 to 110 with a particular advantage in verbal skills. However, given the number of whites with similar IQs, Jews still fight well above their weight.So, while IQ matters, I’d argue that its other behavioral attributes that are Jews “secret” power, including the following:1. ClannishnessGiving preference to your own and working as a team is a massive force multiplier and why Jews are terrified of whites doing the same.2. Mental aggressivenessJews are just pushy. It’s annoying on a personal level but works great for moving ahead in a society, especially a society of nice, high-trust whites.3. No Regard for the Law or Customs of the LocalsJews (and Indians) couldn’t care less about the law. Sure, they love to learn about our laws, but not out of respect but to evade them. Same for non-Jewish customs.4. ChutzpahJews, while being pretty neurotic and lacking in confidence in some regards, are incredibly cocky about their ability beat the other guy in business or law.So, no, it’s not Jewish intelligence that gives them such an advantage; it’s these other behavioral traits. There are way more smart whites than Jews, but most lack these attributes and thus fall far short of Jews.Heck, look at Musk. Incredibly smart, richest man in the world, but he was forced to take the knee.

                    I had the honor of working with such a rich man about 6 years ago.
If you are a nerd about conservative politics, you’d recognize his name.
His wealth was secure from being cancelled and he had written checks to white nationalists before.
But he was really old and got cancer just months after I met him.

                    I doubt $100 mil is anywhere close to enough to make a difference. Nikki Haley’s super PAC has already raised over $50 mil.On the other hand, if your focus is, “Local, local, local”, even 5 figures makes a difference.Problem is  taking it any larger than that. Anything much bigger than a county will draw attention, particularly if it holds “objectionable” views. As little as Taylor’s race realism got him unbanked and cancelled. Similar with Brimelow’s immigration. DR incorporates both of these, plus a whole lot more.A county might fly under the radar. But unless DR can somehow convince the world that  6 million of us were gassed…?

                    I also am confused about Elon. As someone who comes from a historically “aspie” family line, I always figured he really wouldn’t give a good shit about treading the straight and narrow in regard to the JQ. Males with the trait (I think of it as a genetic advantage :)) are usually less emotional, don’t pick up on, or care about, social norms or cues in order to be perceived as  “normal”. Apparently his mom schooled him well in adapting to the power centers.

                It’s far easier to have your own country or just be left alone if you also own the high ground atop a gravity well and possess the monopoly on dropping rocks and other dense objects into it.This will have occurred to Musk. Being outlier high IQ he’s got his own motivations (amongst others, dying on Mars) and it’s unlikely that he’s very interested in the dreams and aspirations of common folk… But once he gets more established Up There, heaven help anybody who gets in his way.I figure that the (very broad rubric) Woke and mystery meat undesirables will get in his way because they just can’t help themselves. Could be very entertaining viewed from a distance.

        “The most likely reason here is the need to think of politics in purely moral terms, which is what Carl Schmitt observed with the friend-enemy distinction.”I think you should fix this, Z. The friend/enemy distinction in Schmitt is absolutely *not* about morals or morality. Good and evil are the antitheses of morality, beautiful and ugly are the antitheses of aesthetics, and friend and enemy are the antitheses of politics. As these dichotomies come from a book entitled “The Concept of the Political,” we can conclude that for Schmitt, politics is not to be thought of in moral terms.How does Schmitt define “enemy,” then? “But he [the enemy] is, nevertheless, the other, the stranger; and it is sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible.” The enemy may be beautiful, the enemy may be morally good, but if the enemy is threatening your collective way of life — your political community — and by extension, your bodily integrity and safety, he is your enemy on that basis.Continuing that thought — one does not ascertain who is your friend and who is your enemy based upon the concepts of good and evil — for someone who is morally evil may not threaten your political community or safety, and thus, have nothing to do with your political life whatsoever (and is therefore not an enemy).The *political* is not defined by the opposition between good and evil or determined using morality, but upon the potential threat (or lack) that another person or collective body poses to your collective and personal *political being.*

                Perhaps, but the thing is, a reader can’t read your mind. We only have your words on the page and screen. I guess if “the need to think of politics in purely moral terms” means “I am thinking beyond good and evil” then you’ll have to explain what “moral” means to you, because to me, morality is usually attached to determinations of what is good and what is evil.

                    No doubt. Good or ill, I often leave things a bit vague or take rhetorical shortcuts, as the constraints necessitate it. That and it has been a long time since I read Schmitt, so I may be conflating my own thoughts with his. It is not the point of the post, so I am not losing sleep over it. If I were to write a post about Schmitt, then I would reread Schmitt.

                    For Z, “moral” is a uselessly capacious and imprecise term combining right and wrong, good and bad, friend and enemy, “who we are” (i.e. the Clean the Park on Third Saturday Club), plus cultural predilections and traditions. In short, it means whatever he wants it to mean, which is why he’s constantly playing Motte and Bailey with it.I’ve gone down this path here before. I have tried to explain that, strictly speaking, morality relatesonlyto questions of right and wrong and is a science about the ends of which the science of ethics is the means, and received a fusillade of downvotes for my trouble. I have tried to explain that using highly idiosyncratic and stipulative definitions of well-known terms does not make you an original thinker, only a confused thinker. That met with the same resultGood luck. Perhaps you’ll fare better.

ID, you may be right about your vision of absolute morality.  But you live in a world where most people simply lack the ability to see what you do.
Most of the people of the world are unable to reciprocate back to you the conduct that you envision.  What then?

        Since becoming a nation in 1948, Israel turned a desert into a paradise despite the West turning their backs on them and having to live in constant threat of annihilation by their neighbors. Israel exports goods and services that benefit the world. Unlike their neighbors who only export hatred and intolerance into the world.You don’t get far in life being ignorant and stupid. What the Jews lack in numbers, they more than make up for in brain power.(1) Israel, nicknamed the “Startup Nation,” was listed by the European Patent Office (EPO) as the country with the 18th most patent applications in 2022. Israel’s innovation ecosystem is one of the most attractive, dense, and productive in the world, home to 9,000 start-ups and more than 70 unicorns. These start-ups raised a record amount of more than $23 billion in 2021, more than double the amount raised in 2020, which was already a record year itself, according to the French Economy Ministry’s website.**https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/technology-science/1680011886-israel-one-of-top-20-countries-for-most-patents-in-2022

            Comparing Jews to Arab is stupid. It’s like being proud that you’re taller than a midget.You might have noticed that whites also transformed deserts into paradise all over the world – and we did it without massive aid from a country that our cousins took over.Israel is reasonably prosperous country, but it shows the limitations of Jews. Jews are a middle-man people, so they thrive best as a merchant minority in prosperous countries. Israel is trying to be a middle-man country – the Switzerland of the ME – but it can’t quite get there, probably because Jews trying to Jew each other doesn’t work so well.As to Israel’s neighbors wanting to annihilate them, well, can you blame them. Like Jews in general, Israel causes constant trouble and, understandably, demands to be the big dog in the ME. But I have no love for the Muslim nations, so let Bronze Age people do their thing.I’m not sure why a German would stick up for Jews. Since WWII (and maybe before), Jews have all but destroyed the German people. Top American Jews in the WWII and post-WWII wanted the Germany cut up and deindustrialized – and that’s after we would have starved millions. Since WWII, Jews have used their cultural power to turn Germany into one large Stockholm Syndrome nation, making Germans ashamed of who they are.I’m not saying that you should hate Jews, but I certainly wouldn’t stick up for them.

                    Jews just aren’t that impressive of a people on their own. It’s a tad harsh, but they need a host.They are the worst’s most successful parasite. Yes, that has negative connotations, but it really is what they evolved to be, and they’re extremely good at it.Their problem is that they’re damaging their current host and finding a new host isn’t going to be so easy. The Asians are way too ethnocentric to let Jews play their games. The Indians are too similar and ethnocentric. The Russians are wary. The Muslims hate them. Africa is filled with Africans.It’s stunning to me that Jews don’t recognize their situation. Sure, they hate us because of their ridiculous Holocaust story, but it’s obvious that they don’t have another landing spot.As always, Jews screw over themselves.

            “What the Jews lack in numbers, they more than make up for in brain power.”
Filling an evolutionary niche outwitting Europeans certainly required  high IQs (if little else). But their role in repopulating Europe with Third Worlders shows no interest in an IQ contest. Even in Israel, hardly a Palestinian attack passes without the sad death of a Somchai or an Anurak.

            I too used to be boggled by the number of startups in Israel, until it finally struck me that there is almost certainly a significant “pay to play” factor in finance with respect to acquiring startups from Israel.I have been involved peripherally in numerous acquisitions of startups in Israel by established US companies. Many make no sense whatsoever in terms of strategic fit, likelihood of success, and especially pricing. The first time I ascribed it to stupidity on behalf of the US executives. The second time to coincidence. But by the fifth time it is clear that something else is at work.If you want to maintain access to the (((capital markets))), then you had better take a favorable look at the startup in Israel that your (((investment banker))) is presenting you this month. Okay, maybe the technology sucks, the product is not viable, and the price is outrageous, but it’s still in the best interest of your shareholders for you to maintain access to the capital markets.

            The USA gives Israel about 4 billion/year.  If they are so successful , why do we do this?
Having said that, I want Israel’s immigration policy and I want a border wall they built with US tax dollars, on the West bank.

        I don’t know whether Jewish IQ is actually that much higher than other groups or by how much, or how much can be attributed to clannishess or tribalism— and don’t really care. But I think the whole subject is pretty tiresome.But Consider the following — who invented the automobile, internal combustion engine, steam engine, rockets, tv, turbojet engines, aircraft, radio, the concept of gravity, astronomy etc etc the list is long.  Nearly every creation that makes up modern life was invented and developed by caucasians of European origin.But Jews did invent the first atomic bomb — oh yes, they created that.

            Even though Northeast Asians have a higher IQ, Whitey is more creative and more likely to think “out of the box.”  Asians are more conformist.   I don’t know, but maybe the same is true comparing Jews and Whites.  Time to pull out Ed Dutton’s book “Making Sense of Race” to see if he writes about that….

            Werner Heisenberg did the theoretical work used to build the Jew Bomb. Most of the Jews like Oppenheimer studied at Heisenberg’s feet. Heisenberg had a quiet agreement with the Jews to not build the atomic bomb, but the Jew’s rushed to the USA to build the Jew Bomb, while Heisenberg sabotaged building the atomic bomb in the Third Reich.Jews tend to have high verbal IQ necessary to convince men like Heisenberg to trust them with the secrets of the atomic reaction. I have little inclination to revisit the subject in detail, but for those interested, Einstein was a psychological operation to spread the meme that Jews are smarter than the goyim and therefore deserve to rule over you. A good place to start is How Einstein Ruined Physics by Roger Schlafly.

        When I started reading you years ago, you had similar articles. The dreaded bell curve and all that. It’s great food for though. What I find most amusing is that I do not begrudge the Jews or the Pacific Asians for their intelligence. Me being a YT heritage American, I’m smack in the middle. Folks on the left of me do not like it however and they will move heaven and earth to not make it so.

        It may very well be that jews have a higher average iq, but their obvious clannishness is an absolute force multiplier.  I have a j friend who, after graduating college with a degree in accounting, left our western state and moved to LA – the jew capital of the west coast.  Of course he hit the jackpot.  Even blacks, with obviously lower iqs, tend to stick together as a group, despite their penchant for blasting each other six ways from Sunday, and cashing in.  Meanwhile, most deracinated Whites are looking around, asking WTF has happened?  Answer – jews and libshits…

        Ron unz has done some deep dives on this and he makes a good point. Jews do have higher intelligence but there are a lot more white men with high intelligence simply because whites are almost 30x the population. So Jews should be a higher representation in ivy league and the professions than their 2 percent but not the level they are at. Most should be white gentiles and Asians.This is where your have to get into in group preference. The ivy league is the path to the elite. Last I looked all the admissions directors are Jews. Now with the coup at Harvard all the presidents are Jews. So given their tribal nature one should not be surprised that Jews are heavily represented. Same with Wall Street, Hollywood, news media, etc

        One aspect that irritates critics of the tiny-hatters (of which I would count myself) is that we largely wouldn’t care about being ruled by a foreign caste if they weren’t you know, obsessed with killing us all.  Squaring the high-IQ with their pathological self-destruction is probably a large part of the puzzlement, but, the two can certainly coexist at the same time in the same space.

                I grew up in St. Louis (“Lagos on the Mississippi”) and I saw first-hand the wariness that blacks exhibited towards whites. Many blacks thought that no matter what they did, whitey would stop them, somehow. Divide and conquer (using the media, “Uncle Toms”, or shadowy agents), or tempt them with riches or power (sports/music/film stars), or give them handouts (gibs), to keep them docile. If only the Black Men would come together and rise up! But they never do. Whitey is indeed powerful…After getting exposed to antisemitism some years ago, I thought that the way many blacks saw whites is very similar to the way that antisemites see Jews. Except that the critiques antisemites have are a lot more incisive than what you see from blacks. The smarter blacks n o t i c e that the fault lies in themselves, and in the “whites” who produce music and own basketball teams.

                    Yes. Black midwits inadvertently betray frustrations with the limitations of their race quite often and mask it as rage. I recently watched an MSNBC clip with a Tamara host, who to roughly paraphrase, snarled, “I know what a lot of white racists are thinking, I’m saying this to please my Jewish paymasters!” It was plain on her face that she realized that was exactly what she was doing. People like Tamara also destroy the Malcolm X nationalist types because they know Africa always wins, which their brightest racial counterparts inexplicably discount.It has to be as galling as it is necessary for blacks to live among infinitely superior people.

                        I was a taxi driver based in St. Louis city, and I drove a lot of blacks around. Since I was one of the few white cabbies I got some candid discussions out of blacks…but a common theme was “n*ggas always f*cking s*it up” meaning that blacks were the reason blacks were so poor and their neighborhoods so shitty. They did think whites were racist, but that was beside the point.Also the only civilized blacks I saw on a daily basis were the Nation of Islam blacks. Yes they hated me, but they were well-dressed and comported themselves well. They were bigoted but at least the bigotry came from interesting sources, not BET. No fake “unity” or “allyship” like you see with woke blacks. I think Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X are far better role models than King or DuBois.

                        @Marko:
King and Du Bois were selected precisely because they were a specific type of role model and subservient to certain tribes and interests. A modus vivendi could be achieved with the Nation of Islam, which is why it never will be allowed to bust out. Sometimes people will quote Marcus Garvey as not seeing a black on the committee when he briefly met with the NAACP, but no one delves into who exactly the committeemen were.

        Intelligence is nice, but it helps to feel trapped — and the Jews have felt trapped in mainstream society since they arrived in Europe. Just as the Japanese — another high achieving group — are stuck on islands with almost no resources, the Jews are implanted in a social matrix that is at best indifferent to their needs. The motivation to try hard, absent in comfortably large mainstream society, takes precedence among the stuck.

            Trapped, you say. Well, that made sense until 1948. Since then, they’ve, shall we say, chosen to stay in their respective countries.

                At last count, I have 6 likes and 9 dislikes. I think the likes get my essential point and the dislikes are vomiting over the word “trapped.” Allow me to elaborate.
If you felt different from everyone else, and also felt you would fall far if you didn’t consistently try in life, you too would succeed on a greater than average basis.

                    I like your comment because of “Japanese…stuck on islands with almost no resources”; the implication is a genetic response to one’s formative environment.  Very perceptive.  Exploiting a specific ecological niche, in other words.
