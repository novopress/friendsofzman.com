        One of my sons recently was shocked by the idea of ‘planned obsolescence’ when I spoke to him about it. No one seems to talk about it much these days but it was a big thing fifty years back, though it is still vital in keeping the economy — or at least production and sales — going.Fashion ‘trends’  are another way to keep people buying the same thing in a slightly different look, though I can see that mobile phones/cell phones only have so many options. It will be a while before they get away from rectangular with rounded corners.Happily the quest for the new never grows old, even if markets shrink.
