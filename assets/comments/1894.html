        Since Mr. Phillips doesn’t make wedding cakes, couldn’t he just charge $25,000 for having to do one? I know it isn’t the ideal solution but he could take the order, order one from a hotel for $300 and have it delivered to the wacky wedding. If they baulk at the price, they can go and harass someone else.
