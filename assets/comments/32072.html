        In the fullness of time, we will look back at the shooting of Republican politicians at a pickup baseball game in 2017 as the start of the political violence cycle.My marker is the political violence inflicted on primary rally goers in Chicago and San Jose in 2016. It was no doubt state-sponsored and had assistance from the FBI and other gangster-type government paramilitaries. If you recall, Trump’s GOP primary opponents (Cruz and Rubio spring to mind but there were others) were generally supportive of the violence. Things only escalated afterwards. The state propaganda organs, as hard as it is to believe now, initially condemned the terror campaign.Eventually there may be some kinetic response from the other way. I suspect one of two things will happen. Either the Regime will curl into a fetal position and whimper, or there will be mass political arrests and summary killings along with widespread censorship. A combination of both also is possible. The overwrought reaction to J6, which was mostly peaceful outside the highlighted riot, indicates the former is quite possible if not likely. The problem is it may never happen and a relatively easy defeat of totalitarianism will be forfeited. This is the usual pattern, so I remain agnostic about it, although of late it seems the appetite for reciprocal violence has increased.I left out another option and it the one I fear most although it is the most unlikely. The Regime could allow Trump to win for a number of reasons. The first would be to act as a Judas goat to try to lure young white males in the South and Midwest to debase and degrade themselves once again with military service. Another option is to have him holding the bag when the economy implodes in the coming months. The other is to use opposition to him to implement the total state. These possibilities alarm me, but the Regime has whipped the Left into such a frenzy it may be afraid of a very real civil war situation if Trump goes back into office.Finally, another upcoming United States-sponsored assassination or Color Revolution could happen in Panama. Voters there has elected a rightwing guy who ran on a platform of closing the Darien Gap. Given the Great Replacement is the biggest goal of this endstage Empire, that looks likely. As an aside, a China-aligned Marxist is poised to be elected in Mexico and the Regime appears fine with it. Whether than means the pro-China faction has the upper hand remains to be seen.

            Yup. Time for a little “democracy” down in Panama. The Darien Gap is CIA staging ground for the invasion of the USA. They aren’t about to let that get closed down or cleaned up.

            It seems to me, as a layman that a bad recession is coming, likely in the next year.  China is a major driver of the world economy now and China is clearly in a deep recession.  It’s been 16 years since the last major recession and it was very short lived.  We had 14 years of money printing in the interim.  I think we had a technical recession in 22, but everyone denied that it even was a recession.  If it happens under Trump, he’ll be blamed and he will demand the printing presses be dialed up to 11. Whether or not the fed will do it is a mystery at this point, though they probably will.We’ve had 25 plus years now of low and falling interest rates.  There are people with 20 plus years of working in banking and finance who have never seen high interest rates or a long recession.  As a layman, it just seems like this cannot maintain forever and that the crashing Chinese economy makes it even more unlikely.  But what do I know?  Maybe this really is the new normal.

                    “Will he be blamed for it”?
Who cares. Everything is fake and gay now. The only people who would believe it and squeal, are gonna squeal anyway.
The amount of groups that are organizing their own response to the coming collapse is surprising to me.
Then again, are you gonna wait in line for your life preserver on the Titanic, or are you going to make your own arrangements.

                    We’ve been in a recession since COVID… The economy is being propped up with paper printing and fake USSR boot production-tier economic statistics. All they have to do is start reporting something closer to the truth and Trump will be blamed for it, yea.

        Fico assasination (attempt) is just another piece of evidence that the enemy is willing to do anything to get their way, while their supposed opposition, the conservatives, just follow rules and refuse to “stoop to their level”.And dissidents just talk, because what else can they do, with no allies among the elites?
This will continue until someone decides to stoop to their level and put a stop to it.

            A disgruntled Regime faction would be the prime candidate to put a stop to at least some of it. For example, I’ve read some rather convincing cases that the CIA has seized domestic operations and control from the FBI, which is seen as too white, too philo-Semitic and too cautious. That could spiral into a range war pretty rapidly and the FBi might emerge as a disgruntled faction with enough heft to present a problem. The intelligence services also have wrested control from the military of Project Ukraine and other fuckeries, and when they go south that may ignite a conflict between those two may be at loggerheads.None of these people are good guys or our guys, but those scenarios are more likely than some ill-fated peasant revolt.

                I think the FBI wins that war. It’s been a corrupt policing organization for a very long time. It has federal policing powers and the CIA doesn’t. The are authorized to use deadly force domestically and the CIA isn’t. They work with the federal prosecutors on a daily and ordinary basis, the CIA does not.It’s not like they are at cross purposes either. The FBI is corrupt inside the US and the CIA is corrupt outside the US. Both support AINO/Globohomo fully.To give you an idea of just how corrupt the FBI is, if they ever want to talk to you, just tell them you will happy to give a full interview in your lawyer’s office with a tape recorder. They will not agree to this under any circumstances. It is a crime to record them without their consent and they record NOTHING. They write out your statement in their language, not yours, in 40 pages and then demand you sign it. This has sent many people to prison.There is a video on youtube of an FBI agent interviewing a cop (at some random intersection) for a supposed ticket fixing corruption investigation. The FBI agent goes ballistic when he finds out the cop has his bodycam running. He orders the cop to turn it off. The officer refuses and questions if he is even an FBI agent. He ends up pretending to be sick and dying of a heat stroke. It is absolutely hilarious. He ends up leaving in an ambulance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C4qbIOhLgw

        The problem with this is that once that particular cat is out of the bag the stage is set for a killing spree… and it isn’t unusual for the guys that start these things to be consumed by them. The purges will inevitably start followed by the genocides. That is what these people do, it’s the way they roll.
Don’t be at all surprised if these guys get erased by their own people before they even get started…

                Certainly true.  More safe to hide in the shadows and emerge after the hard work and sacrifice and “culling” is done, then pretend to have been a part of it.  How many Congresscritters exaggerate their military records?  It never grows old.

                    The Tucker-Prince interview was interesting. It sounds like Tucker is fairly serious about his personal security measures.
Not sure what to make of Prince. Suddenly the guy who ran America’s Wagner Group is an anti-establishment cash and privacy advocate?
Though, I think the real reason Prince flies coach, which he wouldn’t admit, is that he figures TPTB would be more reluctant to down an entire airliner just to take him out.

                        Prince came across as slippery and sometimes deceitful. Also, note how he frequently lapses back into Regime propaganda. I also got the vibe that Prince was putting out feelers to be a counter-point to Wagner.

They want white males back on board. Everybody here is thinking civil war, but to be honest, the regime needs to solidify its gains now, not keep this insanity going another five years. Too many people have exited the system and they need them back.

I’m not a huge believer that government provides a whole lot of solutions. Some think that government can solve society’s problems. I tend to think private charities and private organizations are better solutions.”[91]Prince credits his time as aWhite House internwith some of his political views. He said that “having that White House internship responsibility and badges, I walked around some of these other cavernous federal agencies, and you want to talk about depressing? Walk throughHHSorHUDorCommerce, you name it.Leviathanrealized.”[91]Speaking of his internship, Prince said, “I saw a lot of things I didn’t agree with—homosexual groups being invited in,the budget agreement, theClean Air Act.” Disenchanted, Prince became a backer of presidential candidatePat Buchanan.[92]

                You forgot “Nazis” and “terrorists.”
Who could possibly object to killing the followers of Orange Hitler? Clearly if he wins again he will put all the Jews into a camp — just like he did in his first term.
Since Adolf Eichmann is unavailable, maybe he’ll put ReichsführerJared Kushner in charge of the deportations.

        It’s interesting to read about the 1960s and 1970s and see how much left-wing political violence there was. It was actual violence, like bombings, not feds telling other feds how to kidnap a governor, or walking through a building after the cops wave you through. Yet, just like the softball shooting, it’s been mostly swept under the rug by the media, and stated matter-of-factly right before they move on to talking about white rage, MAGA extremists, insurrectionists, and discussing how White people are the problem and they need to go. The other element of it is that the people who perpetrated the left-wing violence of that era have been redeemed, exalted, and elevated by the system. So, wherever we are at now, it could get a lot worse and it probably will get a lot worse. I don’t know how Trump thinks he can trust the Secret Service with his life and his family’s life. They could go full Tsar Nicholas on them and at least 40% of the country will cheer.I guess the only potential saving factor is that, like so many other elements in life, and as Z discussed yesterday, is that the competency crisis touches upon all things. One look at the spiteful mutants of antifa and you see that, the Weather Underground, they are not.

            Like protest, the political violence that is allowed is the political violence of which the power structure approves. If we consider lynching of rapey negro thugs in the South political violence, and compare the response to that with the response to the undoubted political violence of Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, etc., we can see that America was fundamentally a Leftist, albeit not radical polity as early as the late 50s. Now that AINO is the most radically Leftist nation on earth, we see the same dynamic play out a fortiori with regard to the J6 trespassers on the one hand, and power structure-supported and funded Antifa and BLM, on the other.

        If there was any doubt that the fix is in and a true “uniparty” exists, I just heard a report that Republican lawmaker in Ohio, where Biden failed to file for inclusion on the ballot in time, were working with “their Democratic colleagues” to figure a way to get him included on the ballot. As I heard the Ohio Speaker of the House(R) say on the radio,” it’s the right thing to do”. Absurdity is so normal now, we are going to have to come up with a new definition.

        Mindboggling that in a country awash in an ocean of guns there hasn’t been any Fico-ing here.
Mostly just “Peanut” dissing “Ray-Ray” followed by spray-n-pray at local weekend cookouts in select neighborhoods that are located on tragic dirt.
“How hard can you push decent, law abiding people?”
I believe the answer is infinity.
“The Beginnings” by Kipling seems inspiring, until you realize it was just mirroring years of relentless government propaganda to brainwash the British public to “Kill the Hun” in WWI.

            I can’t say much about Secret Service competence one way or the other, but their presence, planning, and manpower around the president at all times is massive. Everywhere the president goes is planned out, scouted, and staked out ahead of time, using all kinds of tech people hardly know exists. It is extremely difficult, I think practically impossible, for some “lone gunman” to get in position to do it. It’s not 1981 anymore.

            “Mindboggling that in a country awash in an ocean of guns there hasn’t been any Fico-ing here.”The government is absolutely salivating for something like that to happen. It would give them the pretext to push national gun registration and to ban “assault weapons.”Indeed, when they can’t get people to take the bait they literally invent shit and entrap morons, like the Gretchen Whitmer “kidnap” hoax. They stooped so low as to entrap a kid named Jerry Drake Varnell, a diagnosed schizophrenic with multiple previous mental health commitments, as an “ISIS terrorist,” LOL.If there’s a high-profile shooting you can bet that the FBI will have been involved in it somehow.

                Sure.Get your hands on a copy of “Falsehood in War-time, Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War” by Arthur Ponsonby, 1928.He specifically cites instances of propaganda used by the Allies against the Central Powers in WWI.  He was very much in a position to know.Updated after WWII.All modern wars involving mass conscription and “total war” use insane propaganda to get men to sign up and die pointless deaths.Read a book like this, and you can’t unsee it when the cycle repeats over and over again. (Available under $20, but pdfs are free)

British media had been priming the public for a war against Germany ever since the end of the Franco-Prussian dust-up and the newly-unified Germany’s subsequent rise to prominence (which scared the British establishment shitless).

            Biden/Trump give me LBJ/Nixon vibes in the sense that the “left” had no problem pinning Vietnam on Nixon the moment he took office. Among other things. To the boomer baizuo, somehow Nixon remains the face of that war to this day. For this analogy to carry on into reality, for Trump to be blamed for Gaza etc., he has to be allowed to win in November.

                Nixon deserves to be the face of the Vietnam war.  He swept into office on the basis of “his secret plan” to end the war.  His secret plan turned out to be “same old, same old” on steroids.  In short he had no “plan” secret or otherwise.  So in that he took on both the reins and the blame for the war and the casualties we incurred after his inauguration.

                    When Nixon took office for his first term, the US had some 536,000 in the Vietnam theater.  When Nixon won by a landslide in 1972 there were but some 24,000 remaining in the combat area of Vietnam.  In 1973 the US had only 50 assigned in country.

                        So?  Nixon had 4 years to bomb the hell out of the place in hopes of winning.  His escalation was nothing short of a plan to use brute force to end the conflict, rather than a path to peace via deescalation and discussion—it was a plan to victory through expanded/escalated war.His final act to draw the war to a close was to massively bomb the  North Vietnam capital and mine Haiphong harbor.  Kissinger basically told the North in Paris we wanted out,  it was an election year, so they worked a phony peace treaty where we agreed to pay them to sign and they agreed not to invade the South—except that the North immediately began to invade the South while the US kept their side of the treaty and began to withdraw.As to 50 men in country—nonsense.  There were many, many more.  Combat units, no.  Advisors, liaisons, and trainers of South Vietnamese army units, yes.  I know a Colonel whose mission was to keep the repeaters running in the countryside.  Definitely more than 50 men undertaking this mission.  It stopped about when Saigon fell.Whether we should have been there or not, is not the story here.  The story is Nixon and his secret plan to end the war, which he escalated.  And as far as a drawdown of US forces, that began with LBJ who famously addressed the nation wrt ‘US boys should not be fighting in a war that Vietnamese boys should be fighting.’  After which LBJ removed himself from further political contention in the 1968 race.

                    Maybe. That was kind of a one-off during the primaries, and the anti-war left called him out for it. After cementing the nomination, he met with Johnson and agreed to not make the war political, then reneged by putting out commercials with pictures of Vietnam next to Humphrey.
His main emphasis was on law and order (largely because of civil rights violence and the bloodshed at the Democratic Convention in Chicago), the American Dream, and something about the end of the long dark night in America.

                The link didn’t work but I went to Sev’s site and read his response to a letter that seems to be what you referenced. I largely agree with it but he left out something that is really important, and why I have come to believe the 2020 election was outright stolen. The Regime isTERRIFIEDof the leftwing it has whipped into a frenzy. If Trump had been allowed back into office, it would have set off uncontrollable civil rest that would have required a number of Tiananmen Square* situations. California might have broken away even still. Some Regime factions seem allied with the troublesome element of the Left, too, which makes revolution possible. I think the Regime would prevail but the bloodshed would make the 1861 event look like a child’s birthday party.Also, if for some reason Trump is allowed back into office (not likely but not impossible) it is a harbinger of (a) the economy is about to implode and a fall guy is necessary or (b) the Forever War against Russia is slated to go hot and a Judas Goat is needed to lead young white Southerners and Midwesterners back into the military to serve as cannon fodder or (c) both.

Trump would signal to the markets a definitive change in policy favorable to them—such as energy independence and Fed market/economy manipulation.  This will remain for most of his term.  Should Trump also fool the public into feeling good about a 2-3% inflation figure, he’ll be golden.Also, Trump is really against war with Russia.  He never spoke an unkind word about Putin during his first Presidency. I’d bet he’ll settle this through negotiation, not escalation—and further, is a man Putin will trust so that’s helpful.  No one gives a crap about Ukraine.  Trump can declare victory and leave.  This will allow Trump to concentrate on China, which is his main objective in building back the industrial base of the country.Tough talk is an election year ploy for the rubes (last remaining Boomers).

                        I upvoted you but remain unconvinced. Trump did push the House cuck leader to send the Ukraine more funds. Maybe that was just election year posturing but it is a fact. Also, I suspect cratering the economy is a plan that has been in the works for years for any number of reasons and everything unfolding is planned.
From your lips to God’s ears, of course.

                        I’m sure that there’s a significant faction among the elite who basically just want it to be 2017 again so they can go back to making gobs of money and screwing each other’s wives. Trump is the way to get back there. Put the BLM lunatics, the AWFLs, the Russia-haters, and the sex perverts, back in their padded cells. Make peace with Putin, start hiring White guys again in the major corporations, and start putting phrases like “meritocracy” and “color-blindness” back in mainstream media using everything from Tik Tok influencers to stodgy old media like National Review.Is this a real solution? Not in the long run. In the time-horizon of a typical corporate executive though this could bring back prosperity and restore confidence in everything from the US dollar to the power of the empire. They won’t bepurging any of the crazy people,admitting any wrongdoing or making any foolish decisions, and of course the fix won’t last. However, I think it is likely that many people in the elite now understand that the whole system is like a drunk dancing, not near the edge of a cliff, but really on top of a crumbing pillar and the wind is picking up.The most important factors in this sudden attack of sanity are probably the empire’s defeat in Ukraine, which everyone now sees as inevitable, and the realization that Israel is making huge blunders and is now clearly NOT invincible. Those Iranian missiles that hit that Israeli military base may not have been all that important militarily but they punctured Israel’s self-confidence and America’s belief that they were backing the strong horse.

                            Interesting point. Like you say, it won’t have any long-term effects, because these types make money from government contracts, corruption and largesse.
Sure would be swell if we could figure out a way to shut off the cash spigot as soon as they evict the current White House squatter, but I’m afraid you are right. Congress is going to keep spending like a bunch of drunken Congresscritters…

Yep, not in the long run.  In the long run it will take a change of the current American character to think long term, not short term—and that is a White thang!
We are not longer a White country—in race and character.  As I’ve said repeatedly, there is a reason the 3rd world is 3rd world and a reason the 1st world is 1st world.  Since the new majority of the American populous is 3rd world, we will become 3rd worldish.

                    “The Regime isTERRIFIEDof the leftwing it has whipped into a frenzy. If Trump had been allowed back into office, it would have set off uncontrollable civil rest that would have required a number of Tiananmen Square* situations.”But wouldn’t that be a bonus for the evil party? Trump would be blamed for the martial law which he would probably be manipulated into declaring. Martial law would also lead to exploits by the intelligence hive and their NGO counterparts of manufactured false flag events which would swiftly be hyped by the Regime flunkie media 24/7. “Far right” conservatards would be blamed by the clueless general public. That would quickly become the prevailing narrative. The Regime is not so terrified of civil unrest by the kooks on the left that they think it presents a serious threat, imo. I doubt there is any real concern of unrest spiraling out of control, at least from this vantage point. Another year might tell a different story.I hope Trump is not elected. If a dem is elected in the general election through even more obvious election shenanigans, that person is going to be blamed when the wheels come off, which I expect to happen this year and the next.

                        The wheels could stay on. I don’t expect it, but they could. It would require the POTUS/FICUS (nod to Sarah Hoyt) veto every spending bill and make Congress override if they have the nads, but it could be done.

                    “…too many anti-biden pieces…”Look for more of this.  Polls and MSM is “fake and gay” as they say.  They are bought and paid for, however they can’t/won’t go down with the ship.  At a certain point, they have to change course, begin to reflect reality, and pretend they had it “right” all along.  What is meaningful is how early in the typical timeline of these events they are changing course.This far out from election could mean that the situation is even more dire for the elites than we imagine, or the elites are planning on a huge change in strategy wrt Biden as “their flunky”—or possibly both.

            “the system needs trump right now so he’ll be safe. trump is a release valve for the frustrations of the white population…”I think this is where competency comes into play. It is absolutely correct and I am sure some elements of the security state said as much, saying “hey we could just control this guy and it will be fine.” But cooler heads did NOT prevail and the entire system went bonkers at the idea of Trump being in office, to the point where they engineered a full blown color revolution with a fraudulent election to keep him out of office in 2020. I don’t think anyone has calmed down since then either. I also don’t think that the elites care about the “frustrations of the white population” anymore, their hatred of the natives is abundantly clear and they show it every single day. I don’t think they see White people as a population to be managed the way they did from WW2 to 2015 and now are just waiting for the right time to treat Whites like kulaks.Even if you think that, hey, they just need Whites as cannon fodder for WW3, well, they’ve kind of burned that bridge by turning the military into a gay propaganda and gender transitioning outfit. They’d have to institute a draft and force White men into it in a way that would make the Vietnam draft look like a vacation.

they don’t want whites to opt out of the system.
for example, if you want to convince whites to poison themselves again they need to have a little bit of faith in the system.
That’s where trump comes in &amp; his vouches for the vaxx, he still praises them.

                    Again, I don’t think they care about Whites anymore. I don’t think they care about Whites opting out of the system because they hate Whites and want them dead. Obviously, this isn’t true of all elites, there are always factions at play, and the smart ones know that it’s tough to run a country where you permanently disenfranchise the majority and largest bloc, but remember who is in charge and realize that many of them are used to being a permanent minority.In the end, there’s no way to see what the system has done since 2020 and what their media mouthpieces have said since 2020 and come away thinking that these are people that want Whites to feel engaged and that they have a stake in the system. Many of those bridges have long been burned.

No, but that’s where trump comes in.
trumptards can be convinced to go to taiwan if deep state creates a fake crisis.
That’s why I said system needs trump(they won’t kill him), that’s the whole point of my post, I guess we went full circle.

                                    If the system needs Trump so bad, then why is the system working so hard to delineate between itself and Trump every minute of the day? Even the lowest IQ Trump supporter can see the system hates him, so I don’t see how putting Trump in again as President would make anyone believe the system is now worth fighting and dying for.
The shame of it all, from the system’s point of view, is that Trump could have been so easily managed and manipulated but it just couldn’t help itself and went full mask-off, which is my point.

                                        you answered your own question, they can’t hide their hatred for white people, that’s why they’re averse to trump, he’s a representative of white people.
Also, they thought they didn’t need him, they actually believed ukraine conflict would cause regime change in russia, and then russia would help nato beat china.
Because they underestimated russia, now they need trump back in office to convince christian whites to contribute to their cause.

I doubt it, @sentry. Maybe in your AO, but not in general.
They would first have to shut down the persecutions. Which is not going to happen.
Further, no one is going to believe scumbags like Schumer or any other Donkeys are going to work with Trump the way McCarthy, McConnell and now Johnson are working with (for) Biden.
And until that happens, no one is going to believe the Deep State is America First.

        “Slovakia is a tiny country tucked away in the eastern most part of what people consider Europe”
I’ve sometimes thought about “Slovakia”, or rather its predecessor “Czechoslovakia”.  Here is an example of a split/secession of a country without civil war and violence.  Perhaps an example for the USA in the near future.  It can be done.

                                That’s a good point. The mob *is* mindless to be sure, but they are lead by race hustlers. These race hustlers know where the goodies stem from. Whites are being milked by them, because that’s where the money is. We will never be “freed” until the dynamics are changed.The break apart in Louisiana with the City of St George is a good example.  Whites supported the whole s**tshow in that city (Baton Rouge), but where not allowed their own school district.  Finally, they got their own city and now the Black pol’s are crying foul and poverty.  Nothing worse than Blacks with authority.

            “Czechoslovakia” was the artificial creation of the college professor Woodrow Wilson, who was so smart he absolutely knew where to draw the national borders of foreign countries. Everyone else, of course, was too stupid to do it.
Wilson also created “Yugoslavia.”

        Over on Instapundit, that libertarian beacon of free speech, I got booted off a thread for making fun of all the ziocons apoplectic about Russia removing some buoys between Russia and Estonia. That’s okay, it’s all comedy to me, I’m just amused at how sensitive they are when you point out how our pink brigade, with tanks that need 8 hours of maintenance for 1 hour of service, our 150 year old B-52’s and grounded fleet of F-35’s will come to their rescue!
What’s good for Kosovo is good for the Russian people in Estonia.

        When there was a mass-shooting in this state last year, for two days the cops went bananas trying to find the guy (who had killed himself in an empty lot a short time after his spree).  It occured to me that were to someone, somewhere else in the state start shooting up anything –  power transformers – mailboxes – store windows – the cops would have gone from bananas to ape-sh*t.  Then if another someone, in other part of the state started putting bullets in the hulls of boats moored in a marina, mayhem beyond imagination would have ensued.It really wouldn’t take much in a situation like that for the establishment to shiver itself to splinters in a hysteric frenzy.  Just a couple of random guys shooting off some hoarded ammo in different locations.Hell, I bet I could bring traffic to a standstill for half a day walking around with a basket- ball painted black with the word “BOMB” stenciled across in big letters.There.  Now back to grilling.  Have a great holiday weekend.

            Mass cop chimpouts seem like a new thing. Police have always been stupid psychos, but now they have a group consciousness that’s more retarded and violent than any individual.The comedically inclined might cite the time they locked down Boston at automatic riflepoint because of an ad for Aqua Teen Hunger Force, but I think the Christopher Dorner manhunt was where the corner was turned. That was a straight up murder mission with no “ROE,” and every cop in America watched it on live TV with a hand grinding in his pants. Old lady in a pickup that matches no suspect vehicle? Let’s pump two hundred rounds through her and her passenger and all the cars and houses behind them.OH GOD YESNo American police force since that fiasco has reacted sanely, proportionately, or helpfully to anything. They snapped. “It got good to them,” in the old slang of their people.

        Semantics matter. One man’s terrorist is another man’s patriotic freedom fighter. When the US military used a Reaper drone to kill Qasem Soliemani ,was that an act of political violence? Or when the Israelis bombed that Embassy in Lebanon?The word games are played endlessly. If the Deep State approves of an assassination, it is excused using a euphemism. If it is the target, then the epithet of “political violence” makes it a crime against humanity. In July 1944, a German officer attempted to eliminate You Know Who, was that political violence? Was that a crime against humanity?At the root, this is all just indoctrination aimed at keeping the pitchfork mob outside the gates. Biden is flying tens of thousands of illegals into the US at taxpayer expense and then moving them around the country to apply for drivers licenses and register to vote. Those mail-in ballots will all be voting one way only. If you want to end “political violence” start there.

        The fellow who tried to kill Fico was a patsy and a pretty obvious one, like Lee Harvey Oswald and Sirhan Sirhan. This attempt was probably orchestrated from on high. Likewise with what happened in Iran. The US ‘deep state’ has a long and dishonorable history of offing anyone opposed to it.On a side note the violence of BLM was orchestrated as well. Anything less would not have served the purpose of creating mayhem so as to dent Trump’s chances back in 2020.If you ever get a chance, watch the 1969 political thriller, ‘Z.’ It’s uncomfortably close to the truth.

            The closest parallels are how the USSR treated the old East Bloc. From memory, Imre Nagy was the only renegade leader the Soviets outright executed. There may have been attempts on Ullrich in East German and Tito in Yugoslavia, but that’s from memory. The GAE is proving far more ruthless. Post-Nagy Hungary actually liberalized. Don’t expect modern Hungary, if the GAE assassinates Orban, to do the same.There are reports that the AfD in Germany may be slated for mass arrests, and D.C. has given La Pen marching orders about what she can and cannot do if the French elect her.It truly is remarkable to have lived through the Cold War only to see this situation develop.

                GAE will not assassinate Orban. They have waited for many years and they can wait a few more. Orban’s popularity is slowly declining, even though he is still by far the most popular politician. The not-Orban bloc will eventually win the election and then rapidly turn the country into a tranny multicultural utopia. Same like they are doing in Poland. The enemy doesn’t waste time and is not concerned about optics.

I’d be willing to bet the Soviets knew better than to kick the hornet’s nest that was Yugoslavia by killing Marshall Tito. Consider that after The Wall fell plenty of ethnic groups in the country looked around, cracked their knuckles, and said “Whelp, time to settle some scores.”

        In big boy politics, deciding who reaps the benefits of running empires and continents, lives are just currency. It is a cold cynical game at the upper levels.
Annie Jacobsen is totally a limited hangout but her assassination book even admits as much. We’ve even had senators calling for “someone” to kill Putin. The idiots on charge have not been burned enough, just like the imbeciles who mismanaged the aftermath of that killing in Sarajevo 110 years ago

        I’m just going to make an official prediction that Biden wins via mail in ballots again and resigns to make Kamala Harris president with newsome as vice president.  Sucks to imagine but if no one is talking about the mail in strategy in swing states then it’s just going to repeat.  Republicans probably know this will happen too.  If I was governor of a swing state I’d ban welfare , immigration, and corn rows at the state level, providing any perpetrators of said crimes a free bus ticket to California. We’d see a crime reduction of 75% and miraculously no mail in ballot shenanigans.

Be of good cheer and the right mindset!  If you really are of the DR, you’ll see the upside in this “downside”.  The more blatant the corruption, the more folks wake up to the fraud of “democracy” and seek alternatives.  It also helps to remember the recalcitrant Boomers are dead and gone within 20 years.  The newer generation has only seen/experienced a corrupt government operating under the guise of democratic appointment.  In that lies hope.

I’m not sure that’s hopeful. The newer generation thinks a corrupt despotic government is normal. The Russian peasant never rebelled because he knew of no other life than the one he was stuck in.
Say what you will of boomers, they’ve seen a life of relative freedom and partly-honest government. They know from experience what a better government, economy and civil life are like. They have stories from the past, but those are real stories.

                    Point taken.  I was thinking of the Boomers—some/most of them—as living in the past and assuming “things will turn around”, or the system can be repaired from within. The vote harder club, if you will.
I have brother-in-law, whose entire argument/thought wrt our corrupt and inept government is, “things run in cycles and like the pendulum of a clock, will eventually swing back the other way”.  He’s made this argument for as long as I’ve known him.  He’s the nicest and a man of great integrity, but clueless.

                He was sort of Reagan-like, generally liked for rhetorical optimism (a relative thing, there) and being a very Japanese character. He was wildly hated by their Westernized corporate media, which demonized him American style (and in silly Japanese style, too) and made him a worldly Satan in the minds of schizos and other sensitive types—”artists,” especially.Examples are the usual sort of thing, except one: The only aesthetically notable Japanese album released this century is calledI Am Not Shinzo Abe.It wasn’t popular, but a title like that is a new symbol. Japanese media was neverpartisan against its peoplebefore.The demonization worked, as it did for Reagan. In a world without guns, a strong enough spell can conjure them.

            Very much this. Yellen can still make sure things crash and burn. Will she? Anyone’s guess. She’s been hesitant to pull the cord on the suicide vest, but for how much longer? If she’s as pro-Israel as it seems, she might do it just to take the pressure off…

Ironically, yes.  Seems I read somewhere that the cruise line industry has resorts and stops at protected ports in *Haiti*.  They keep it fenced off and guarded, with only limited admission of the native stock.  Beaches and resort facilities are first class.  Can’t say they are still a port of call given the publicity of late, but when Haiti was calmer, they stopped there.

            Christcucks gonna christcuck. I personally know of several people who have done “Haitian Missions” more than once! Unrelated people, a couple christcucks in my orbit.Lest you think I’m besmirching Christianity, I am not. But “that” Christianity is invery low supplyin the pozzed West right now. What I see instead are the egalitarians and even worse the “Missionaries” who basically go to 3rd world countries particularly Haiti &amp; Africa give them a real hard-on. And not only do they artificially circumvent Darwinian selection they also attempt to BRING these genetic missing links to the US once they “find Christ”. You like them so much? STAY in Haiti, simple as…Between Leftists DEI cultists and Christcuck rightists is it any wonder we are imploding demographically?I’m so puzzled by this absolute lemming like behavior so many Whites exhibit and I think that thing about the Hajnal Line being a factor, while very generalized, seems accurate to me. Eastern Euros, Rus, Southern Euros, seem largely immune to this absurdly trusting nature. One could argue that is also why their societies and civilizations never flourish like NW Europe, but was once a liability is now becoming an asset as the West is terraformed into Bantustan.They are WAY more resistant to this type of thing.It is just really unfortunate that we allowed the skinsuit wearing chameleons into the West so they could go about the business of exploiting our high trust societies and natures.

        They could also weaponize our psychotic cops.  Frankly, I’m surprised the Roger Fortson shooting has not been weaponized with BLM protests.  Maybe it is because it’s Florida?  While not an outrageous shooting, I do think it’s a bad shooting.  If anything, being a bad shooting is probably what disqualifies it as a BLM protest generator.  They love an obviously guilty person being justifiably shot as the BLM martyr.

            I’m confused here.  I thought I saw a letter a while back from the military to those “fired” from service asking them to consider coming back since there was no longer any requirement for vaccination.  This was definitely before the April date mentioned at Zero Hedge.At that time, I posted that the letter seemed disingenuous since there was no “compensation” mentioned for those who were wronged by discharge.  For example, some sort of back pay and added service credits for time spent discharged.Nowhere in the Zero Hedge article does it mention Congress adding such enticements.  Without such, I suspect few servicemen with consider the offer.

                Noticed the same thing.
If they were offering to reinstate at triple damages, like is pretty typical in civil judgements (credit for triple time, triple back pay, triple reimbursement for, say, health care that should have been covered by VA, etc.) and that money is to first be collected from the personal assets in non-dischargeable joint and several judgements against those responsible (clear down to the “just following orders” contingent) then maybe it would be worth it.

        The Regime has done too much to back down now. Many of court cases are suspended, not thrown out. Trump has had much of his wealth taken away. And it will NOT stop at Trump, which is why you see so many Republicans showing up at his NYC trial. It will not even stop with Republican politicians — it has already escalated to just general Catholics, the Knights of Columbus, Straight White Males in general. Trump cannot be allowed to win as he will retaliate with Republican support against Obama, the Bidens, Schumer, the CIA/FBI/DOJ, various Generals and Admirals, and the NGO-istan like the Soros / CIA nexus. With support of a very angry White male population and those stymied out of advancement by DEI and ESG and Diversity.I think very likely, the judge in the NYC case will throw Trump in jail without his Secret Service protection in general stir where the Epstein treatment has already been prepared. Then the Regime will “suspend” the elections due to the “emergency” it caused, and Obama will step back into the White House to “preserve our democracy.” With a policy of a White Tax, payable in $2 million a year or YT serves on the Russian Front as Ukraine collapses and we have US troops fight Russian ones directly to overthrow Putin and seize Russia. [Yes, we have had small numbers there since the start and the numbers have grown big in the past months.]  It has been confirmed that the FBI in its raid on Mar-a-Lago planned to shoot Trump and his Secret Service at the slightest resistance. It was likely a planned assassination that someone at the FBI at lower levels called off at the very last moment. Sanity is not always going to prevail.The Regime has imported millions of military aged males to be its outsourced enforcers and jackboots. However they are undisciplined and come from many countries, they are likely to just loot indiscriminately and create terror. The Regime’s plans are to throw YT in some sort of virtual work camp ala the Uighurs in XianXing Province to prop up the Project Ukraine war effort one way or another. Most likely YT scatters, and turns off the power.Forget cyber-threats, the power grid is enormously vulnerable to even CIA led eco-terrorists in Germany shutting down Tesla plants by burning transmission towers. Well, the same thing applies here, also to water supplies in the West, and key bridges and overpasses etc. No power, no war effort. YT has no faith in the Regime anymore*, remove Trump they remove the last vestige of non-violent reform and you get the Civil War they wanted. Just not the big battles they envisioned, a steady turning off the power in more and more of the nation. No power, no modern society.*While trivial, the attempt by the Media to cancel Harrison Buetker, the Chief’s kicker, has failed. Andy Reid and Mahomes both said he wins games for them so shut up. The general public has been very cool to the demand Buetker be fired and replaced with a woman. Even Don Henley has a song about work not being worth more than relationships.

            You are watching a movie. Normally these things happen under the cloak of darkness. You are seeing everything happening because they want to see it.
Who wants you to see it is the question. I happen to believe it’s people friendly to Trump. That it’s a reenactment of things that have already happened in the past. It’s just too cartoonish to be anything else.
It could also be that the powers that be trying to send a warning to the next wannabe Trump.
We’ll see.

                Maybe, maybe not. Social Media and the internet transformed “the love that dare not speak its name” to the one who will not shut up. Everyone wants to boast. Merrick Garland just officially denied that the FBI came in hot, lethal force. Which means stage two of: “you are exaggerating; it did not happen; it happened and you deserve it.” The merited implausibility.Nevertheless, if Trump is allowed to win (he drew 35K at the Bronx, they had planned for 3,500) he will put Obama, the Bidens, Hillary!, and a bunch of CIA/Feebs on trial for sure. Indeed its the only way to stop it — mutually assured lawfare destruction.Our leaders are stupid — Jabba the Kagan, Cookies Nuland, is out demanding that the US strike deep into Russia to start WWIII. Saying we might get our hair mussed, but 30 million dead tops. Who the heck hires Jabba the Kagan anyway? Cartoon meet the Lightworker and President Depends.

        See this video by Mike Benz about globohomo’s assassination/assassination attempts on right wing populist leaders:https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1790821255861751975Zman writes: “Now think about the situation with Trump. The regime has thrown everything at the guy over the last two years, but he keeps chugging along. Not only that, but his popularity is also probably higher now, and more intense, than when he ran in 2016 or 2020. At the same time, the liberal hatred for the man is now soul defining. If any means necessary was justified in 2020, it is even more true in 2024.”I thought this was the case previously but now I’m not so sure.  Two of Trump’s show trials have been pushed out past the election.  Trump totally caved on the $90 fraud so-called “aid” bill to Ukraine/Taiwan/Israel (it’s just cover for washing those funds back into the hands of the transnational security elite) and ended up supporting it.  Benz thinks Trump caving on this issue means that globohomo may be OK with him winning:https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1787178953460908442Also consider that the Biden administration recently passed rules that prevent Trump from firing basically anyone in the unelected civil service, combined with the above fake-aid bill triggering automatic impeachment if Trump tries to withdraw from Ukraine, and it looks like the election has been “fortified” regardless of whoever wins (and Trump did support the heart attack jabs…).  Perhaps they will let him win and then crash the economy around himas they raise interest rates to 10%…

                Shouldn’t. It could easily be the other way around, but the higher the interest rate, the more incentive to save, and the less cash sloshes around buying up new grills and spinners.

        Complicating the Summer of Hate, is the ongoing coldish turning hot civil war among elites.Item 1: Democrats / NGOs / the Media (yes, I’m repeating myself) have a new line of attack that is going to be used by the DoJ: Trump “conspired” (by saying it publicly) that he wants Oil company donations so he can tear up Biden’s “good save the planet” restrictions on oil drilling, exploration, and refining.That’s good for the Greens, not so great for a US Military tasked with defeating China (who may or may not be set to invade Taiwan next month) and Russia with “green” battery powered tanks … dependent on Chinese batteries. The US military seems to be pro-Trump on the assumption that he will at least kill the Green delusion that makes war-fighting a guaranteed loss.Item 2: The North Carolina shooting. A US Special Forces Lt. Col. found a suspicious man speaking only broken English on his property (a community filled with US Spec Ops people) taking pictures of his kids with a camera equipped with a telephoto lens. [Against a backdrop of Chinese and Muslim foreign nationals crashing US military bases]. Altercation ensues and said foreigner is shot dead by the Col. A separate foreign national flees, is arrested and let go.The dead foreign national is eventually identified as a Chechen illegal, with no identification on him, Russian language cell phone, he was supposedly an employee of a subcontractor of the local power company but had no ID, uniform, equipment, or tools. The FBI is now involved.How did this Chechen national get hired by this subcontractor? How did he know that his target was a Spec IOps commander? Why was his accomplice just let go? Who set this up? Is this a quiet CIA/FBI vs Spec Ops war? Is this a brush-back pitch by the CIA/FBI/Intel community against Spec Ops of “go along with what we have planned or else your family gets it?”The Summer of Hate is opening broader folks. Looks like elements of the elite are joining the party. Purges: not just for Dirt People anymore.

        Z – I know you hate libertarians, but what do you think of my idea of libertarianism. That is to say that I want to increase liberty, even if it means doing unlibertarian things. Like I think the state seizing control of blackrock might actually increase personal liberty.

            Calling state seizure of corporations libertarianism is kind of like calling what we currently have a democracy. It may be the right thing to do, but legitimacy demands more honesty than that.

            “…seizing control of blackrock” and all the other transnational corporations isn’t ideological. It is akin to removing a would-be murderers hands from around your neck. There is NO way out of this that does not involve nationalizing (then destroying) all the transnationals. No foreign citizenship, and no foreign property ownership, and no foreigners owning property inside our country, are bare minimums.

                “No foreign citizenship, and no foreign property ownership, and no foreigners owning property inside our country, are bare minimums.”
I’ve often thought of these prohibitions and wondered how our pol’s would explain our laxity on these issues in light of their overwhelming support/use in other countries.  Of course, they’d use that tired old saw, “…it’s not who we are…”, a non-explanation if there ever was one.
Oh well, one can dream…
