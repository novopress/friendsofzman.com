        HRC is exhibit A for my argument that our “votes” matter as much as Romans’ “votes” mattered under the Caesars.  She’s so spectacularly corrupt that even the media bobbleheads can’t ignore it.  Her rallies could be held in a phone booth.  I live in a college town and can’t find a Hillary supporter for love or money.  Even the blue-haired gyno-warriors are voting for the ancient Jew… and yet, she will be her party’s nominee.  I’d vote for Trump just for that – she doesn’t know how to do anything but fling dirt, which is right in Trump’s wheelhouse.  Yes, by all means, let’s start publicly airing names, dates, dollar amounts…. let the people see it all.

            Even my office manager, a commie and Hillary Clinton supporter, is tepid in her enthusiasm. That could all change this summer, but the pendulum is swinging the other way and it would be hard for any Democrat to win in 2016.

            Same in my college town – Princeton area  crowd is 100% behind the old Jew. Once in a while, I spot a pro-HRC sticker, always an a car driven by an older, hatchet-faced woman.

                    Thanks, Strelnikov and Terry Baker.  About that stupid handle: I needed something to post under back in the early days of the innerwebz, and I’d just read the last Book of the New Sun at the time, so…. it’s pretentious as all hell, and I cringe a little bit every time I type it, but that’s the rub with tradition, I guess.  I’m stuck with it.  Maybe I should make my handle an unpronounceable symbol, in honor of the late Mr. Nelson.

            The votes of the People of Rome stopped mattering long before the Caesars – including the first one.
The Roman Senate was so corrupt that it made our Congressional clownshow look like Sunday Church school.

        I’ve said right from the start that blacks will vote for Trump.  They like the over the top personality, they like the bling.  Virtually all their heroes are rich rappers, athletes, actors, comedians etc.  Guys like Ben Carson or  Justice Thomas leave them cold. They loved Bill Clinton not because of his politics so much as his life style, free-wheeling fun guy that liked the women.  Plus Trump’s got bags of money the currency of cool in the ghetto, oh and hot wives.

            Yep. Trump is a badass pimping motherfucker with three different baby mamas and crazy-ass bling. He is someone that black women can aspire to sleep with, and black men can aspire to be like. Whether that will actually drive some black people to the polls to vote for him who otherwise wouldn’t vote is debateable. What isn’t debateable is that, aside from the hardcore BLM/Black Panther/Kill Whitey types, black people will mostly be just fine with a Trump presidency.

        Pandering and free stuff doesn’t work on Jose?  Maybe not anymore, with the level of flagrant arrogance and resulting disgust, but it surely worked on Rufus and Willis since 1965, and had been working on Jose since the early ’90s.  California had gone GOP in every election since 1952 (exception ’64, thanks for that Mr. Oswald) until 1992.  Now, it is a hopelessly lost wasteland, and it is solely thanks to demographic overruns.

        Hillary Clinton is the US version of Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, although Bill is still alive. CFK’s designated successor lost the recent presidential election, her party is now fractured, her far-left supporters in disarray and her cronies (and she herself, perhaps) are being prosecuted one by one; HRC may suffer a similar fate and it’s long overdue. A Trump victory is a real possibility if Argentina’s recent election can be considered a bellwether.

            I suspect there is a deep well of disgust for Hillary Clinton and not just on the Talkshow Right. The Left does not trust her. Trump’s “crooked Hillary” line will stick. He’s also going to go at her lies, which is something the so-called conservative media is afraid to do

            Best storyline for Hillary going into the general (un-indicted, one presumes) would be as “valiant widow, carrying on for the people..”  If only Bill would cooperate and drop dead.  Though his appearance these days is pretty consistent with end stage cardiac disease.

                If end-stage cardiac disease makes people look spacey, you have nailed it.  Bubba is a mere shadow of his former self, and looks more like end-stage senility than anything.    Or maybe he’s just bemused that that his ugly Old Girl may get him back into the White House just one more time?

        It truly is a joke, voting in the ghetto, which are essentially single party parallel communist entities.
How many ghetto dwellers even work in the free market economy, if we exclude government, aa and prison jobs as categories? Is it even 10%?
There were more people participating in the underground economy behind the iron curtain than blacks are participating in the above ground economy now.

        You are so lucky. They took away our right to vote at a polling place in WA state and made us vote by mail. I hate it. And, they have this swell rule for the primaries. The top two vote getters face off in the general. So we can have Dem vs Dem. We can get to single party rule so much faster! I don’t live in Puget Sound where the real lunatics are, so I don’t get to vote for socialists too often.

        Oh my that is some good snark. Proper snark always puts things in proper perspective.Zman, have you ever considered posting a very brief pithy commentary with an anachronism, like TINVOWOOT, (there is no voting our way out of this?), and see what kind of commentary it could generate?It’s kind of like a belly dancer in a dark smoked filled venue, all those sultry pieces of gossamer clothing, the sensuous body rhythms, the sultry dark skinned raven haired seductress, how sometimes leaving much to the imagination and passions is far more tantalizing than naked raw flesh.Just saying

        Have there ever been two worse possible candidates for US president in recent history? It’s hard to believe that from all America has going for it, these two are the best and brightest your country can come up with. This is not a criticism of the American political process, just a comment on what seems to be a serious lack of qualified individuals who could actually run a country properly. Both of the major parties have had eight years to groom someone, come up with viable plans to correct major problems, and yet here you are. It seems at election time, Americans always find themselves choosing the lesser of two evils, rather than choosing the best and most qualified candidate.

            Gee, Karl, I have to disagree completely. Trump is, by far, the best and most qualified candidate for President since Ronald Reagan. And in fact, the only other candidate since 1900 who was as qualified as Reagan and Trump was Eisenhower. Aside from Ron Paul and Ross Perot, the rest of the candidates over the last century have been worse than useless. Of course, I tend to view professional politicians as despicable worthless sacks of protoplasm who couldn’t run a lemonade stand, much less a country, so naturally I view any person who has succeeded in a competitive, free-market, non-political career before they entered politics as automatically being head-and-shoulders more qualified for office than any professional politician. It’s an unpopular opinion but frankly, the facts are completely on my side.

                        The advantage is they don’t typically think in terms of political preservation, they think in terms of logic and reasoning based on facts and evidence. Obama’s move to legalize millions of illegals is obviously to increase votes for his party. Merkle’s decision about Syrian refugees was a purely humanitarian reaction to a horrible situation. While many Germans still don’t agree with her decision, we can respect her sense of humanity. Her decision was one of compassion, not political self-gain.

                            Scientist once approached science in terms of logic and reasoning based on facts and evidence, not so much anymore. And at no point in history did they approach social science on that basis. Their opinions were made worse by thinking that they were being objective.Except for the purpose of trolling, there is not much point in reading a lunatic right wing blog if one is incapable of being educated in the experience of it. Until we overcome the shock of learning our opinions are actually within the orbit of the left, no progress can be made in understanding the greatness of the far right or even what that is.

That might have a kernel of truth IF the “refugees” were widows, orphans and the aged, not young, military-aged welfare-seeking hoodlums who comprise the vast majority of Syrian refugees. So don’t lie to us , Karl. We can read and understand what’s going on. .

                        “Credentialed” not “educated”! There is a world of difference, especially since affirmative action has reduced the value of education. Obama = first affirmative action POTUS; elected purely based upon race.

And a PhD in physics qualifies one to do what? Take selfies with members of the Muslim horde?  Credentials are no substitute for  business experience, common sense and leadership.  What exactly has good  Doktor led, besides a migration of 7th Century Third Worlders into Germany?

            Sadly, you’re correct.  The entire field of US presidential candidates this last year has been pathetic.  In fact, Trump’s success in the polls is a direct result of the very disappointing pool of choices offered to the American voter in 2016.  The Republican field consisted of nothing more than bland, vapid and blatantly careerist politicians with one notable physician and a rich, spoiled and not-too-bright billionaire thrown in to spice things up.  Trump would normally be a bad choice and everyone, including his supporters in moments of intellectual honesty, admit it.  He’s not the successful entrepreneur his hard-core fans would like you to believe when you consider he inherited so much money in the 1970s and so many of his much-touted real estate deals have gone bad.  His foreign policy ideas are just not grounded in realities and his speeches are no more than “rah-rah, we’ll make America great again!!” nonsense.  But he succeeds for the time being because the rest of the Republican field is sooo bad.  Sanders is a socialist who NEVER worked a real job in his life, by his own admission.  He’s been a career politician since he was in his 20s and he’s really too old (74 years of age) for the Oval Office’s heavy demands.  His supporters tend to be old, former hippies/die-hard socialists who were always ignored by the Democratic Party except when it needed their votes, and young millenial hipsters who think socialism is great, if only because they have no familiarity with how it works in actual practice and it’s cool to support Bernie when you’re at some vegan bar trying to impress whoever it is you’re trying to sleep with.  And Hillary?  Oh my God, I weep for America if that woman gets elected into Executive Mansion.  HRC had no political career except as the wife of a politician until she and Bill left the White House in 2001.  Being the wife of the President allowed her to gather critical social and political contacts within the Democratic Party to run for the Senate in 2000.  She’s the most blatantly political of the candidates in the sense of saying whatever is necessary to get one’s vote, never mind her unprincipled and corrupt character and questionable activities over the last 30 years (anyone else remember the whole Whitewater scandal from the 1990s?). It speaks volumes that female Democrats aren’t exactly thrilled with her as a choice and many millenial females would rather vote for a 74-year old man rather than her.  Bottom line:  it’s going to come down to a Trump versus Clinton race.

            Karl, as an aside, the Erdogan, Boehmermann, Merkel controversy reminded me of a DDR era political joke.
Honecker und Mielke unterhalten sich über ihre Hobbys.Honecker: “Ich sammle alle Witze, die über mich im Umlauf sind.”Mielke: “Mensch Erich, da haben wir ja fast das gleiche Hobby. Ich sammle nämlich alle, die sie in Umlauf bringen…”
Everything old is new again
Being an Ossi, Merkel must have heard this joke and many like it.. I wonder if she is capable of seeing the irony of her position.

                    I like that. The Swiss can get by with that sort of thing because Erdogan can’t open a political valve and flood Switzerland with violence prone and unemployable invaders.
Alas for Germany, and I say that as someone who lived and worked there for 14+ years and grew to like the country and the people I met there.

                            I can’t guess what a right decision might be. If Böhmermann isn’t punished somehow, Erdogan can open the immigrant valve and burden Germany further with migrants.  If he is punished, German citizens will be increasingly annoyed at being pushed around by a foreign near-dictator.
The Ossis especially have memories of being overrun by rapey foreign men which may well account for PEGIDA’s strength in the the former East.

            While I agree completely, I think that question could be asked of pretty much all democratic states.  I’m not sure if it was one of the Founders or Roy Rodgers, but someone said that the only people who’d *want* to be elected officials should never, ever be allowed to.  And rest assured, when I’m dictator that’s going to be my first dictate.  I’m going all Greek polis on y’all — all citizens’ names go in a hat, shake it a few times, and pick out your officials.  Like jury duty, but no exceptions except mental incompetence.  The standard of governance will rise 300% overnight.

            We are doing an experiment to see if we can be governed by someone that isn’t a career politician. That is in fact what the Founding Fathers of this country wanted. Trump is very capable of handling big projects. He is having to learn how to be a politician. He may prove to be one of the best yet.

            Bush-Kerry? McCain-Obama? Romney-Obama? seems like a pretty solid trifecta of downright lousy, rotten, clueless and stupid candidates for POTUS. HRC of the Clinton Crime Family is a foul, corrupt scourge unto herself. But the Donald at least has experience running things and hiring people, so, blowhard that he is, that’s part of the schtick. At least he should be smart enough to hire people who will do a decent job and not be part of the same old Establishment crowd.
