        While looking at a recent photo of Zelensky and his staff, I thought I was watching some kids Bar Mitzvah. These people aren’t Ukrainians and they could care less about how many are killed. All these people will pack up their valuables and leave for some Western country if Ukraine crumbles. Their cousins in the West will make sure they live comfortable, guarded lives, while ethnic Ukrainians go through living hell.

                Z: “The Kamala Harris campaign can be boiled down to a promise of feel goods. The entire production is a collection of symbolic shapes and sounds to transmit the simple idea that it feels good or that the alternative will make you feel bad.

                Search engines are your friends. Jewish publications can be found crowing about his Jewish ethnic heritage and upbringing with a 2 keyword search. His PM is also Jewish by the same source in 2023

                    I know he’s Jewish, but my people from the Balkans aren’t Jewish, and he doesn’t look too much different. He’d fit right in. He doesn’t look so much like a broad-faced Pole or a Ruskie, but he’d fit right in our region. Ukraine also has a lot of overlap with Bulgaria and Romania. In fact, I think there are Bulgarian and Greek enclaves within Ukraine. Just look where it is on the map.

                        I know some Bulgarians from Izmail (Odessaoblast). Zelensky indeed fits the Balkan phenotype more on some photos, but otherwise he has a rather south-eastern face. I’d probably look for his kinsmen in Crimea or the Middle Volga region if I knew nothing about him. His eyes are probably the most outstanding jewish trait especially on his earlier photos.

                                I’m not up for educating people, Americans in particular. This is not Reddit so I wouldn’t be afraid of negative karma points.
Are you related to people from the Western Balkans? Jewish faces sometimes betray their ancestral area (Madeleine Albright comes to mind) so maybe that’s how you got the impression.

                Here’s another one where the buffoons on this page go crazy downvoting something that is 100% factual. “Slav” does not only mean Pole or Russian. It means a lot of other things, too. It can mean Serbian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Montenegrin or even Albania or Greece (yes, Slavs live there) … If he was walking on a sidewalk over there, just based on appearance alone, nobody would think that he wasn’t a local.
When I was in Greece, everybody would start jibbering to me in their language which I do not understand.

            Hmmm….one would think a “guest” culture (or, at least at times, “parasitic”) would be mindful of the need to insure its host remains relatively healthy. Else (from the parasite’s point of view) the infestation will worsen until either the host somehow rids itself of the hangers-on, or else both weakened host and parasite die.

                No, they will go to NY and/or Miami.  They will join the other 200-500,000 Israelis that already moved to the US.  And that’s not counting all the dual citizens.

        During the ’30s. the party line in Moscow changed with bewildering frequency, and commies around the world scrupulously followed each about-turn. Each time they doublebacked on themselves, they insisted that they had never thought anything different.
We see people like this everywhere, every day now. We are surrounded by them. It is stunning, and deeply depressing, to behold so many who have renounced their reason so totally. People whose unspoken, but increasingly audible plea to the TPTB is “please tell me what to think”. The Comintern would have been awestruck.

            In the videogame Warframe the villain had managed to install mind control devices on everyone in the solar system save two: the hero and his “mother” (long story).  Anyway, the villain’s toadie is trying to assuage the raging villain and with a brush of his hand the villain remarks “I only care aboutthosetwo, I don’t care about all the other people, they were already waiting to be told want to think.”

            It is stunning, and deeply depressing, to behold so many who have renounced their reason so totally.One of every two days I am overcome with this feeling while in public. Soon it will be all of them. Deeply depressing is right. I have my own family ready to turn me in. I have a sister who now denies giving her children the vaccines when I have angry texts from her in 2021 warning me that if my failure to get vaxxed killed my mother she would have my head. I sent her a pdf of her texts and have not heard from her or her husband in six weeks. I take it they are enraged at me.I don’t feel at home anywhere now. I live in a purple state and am disabled and have no financial means to escape. (I’m not “disabled” by the state’s definition, I just can’t walk or see out of one eye. In my state, you are legally able to drive with just one eye.)

                    Whitney’s comment, for some reason, strikes me as deeply important.I think that unnoticed, and rather revolutionary, insight could point to an image showing the change or difference in neurological function.
A kind of learned autism or even Alzheimer’s, perhaps?The broken linkages of emotive or trauma conditioning.Orwell’s learned stupidity, or learned helplessness.
These could even lead to imagery displaying what I call Infection, and what many call, Possession. An exploitable vulnerability.Just as Penitent Man’s comment points to a learnable armor.

                        thinking its people being too lazy to learn and happy being “simple”.  i have many varied interests which thankfully i can be proficient.  trouble when picking up a subject i have not visited for years, the curve seems quite large.  once i begin its not so difficult after all.  maybe these people just see a stumbling block and move on in another direction.  wide and unobstructed is the path to hell.

                Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.Isaiah 41:10Gentle your heart and be gentle toward the people around you, Brother. Stop seeing everyone around you as mindless automatons. Many feel as atomized as you.Some here will snicker at the “imaginary sky Santa” but never forget you are beloved child of God. You are never alone or forgotten.Instead of believing you are alone in a blasted desolate land… understand you move under the loving embrace Him and His Son. Around you among the ‘unreasoning’ masses are lonely and isolated folks just like you.You say you are half-blind but I think you have one good eye. Open it and see the souls moving about you. Be gentle and not loud, befriend people and try to love them. You may find that love reciprocated. In any outcome, you are never alone and never despised by Him that truly only matters.

I have sat down with wife and spoke as softly as I can about her health and the need to consider her previous vexxination history in such discussions with doctor.  One can’t unring a bell, but one needs to consider current symptoms in light of new knowledge of the adverse effects of such previous folly.

                Indeed, I think that’s what the original 1956Invasionmovie authors were cleverly trying to warn us about, the same as the 1944 movieGaslighting.
(Personal note, I remember seeing the original Invasion on b&amp;w TV, that is, when TV was only in black&amp;white.  We were so innocent then.)

                In the original1984novel, the hero works for the government before gradually becoming an independent thinker. In our world, he would probably be scanning the internet for interesting political articles to read when he stumbled upon a site like ZMan’s which triggered a series of nonconformist thoughts … It is possible to read correct “disinformation” like this site’s, but you have to be lucky enough to find it…— G.N.

        It’s been obvious to us on the DR that gibbering Joe was never calling the shots over the past four years.  Now, since Biden has been officially deep sixed, it’s amazing (sort of) that no one in the media (lol), or in general aren’t questioning who the hell is running the show – and is there actually a president.  Congress isn’t doing anything, Harris and her perv in waiting certainly aren’t.  Apparently the nyt had an article about the fact AA secdef Austin (lord help us) has ordered more naval assets into the ME area – not congress, not Biden etc. – but do they think this really a problem?  It’s pretty much been the same for the past couple of decades.  This govt is a rudderless ship out of control.

            Most people frankly do not care that they no longer have any input into “their” government, to the extent they ever did. As long as bellies are full and they have warm shelter in the winter, dictatorship is fine with them. Much of the open descent into totalitarianism is in anticipation of the day hunger and exposure become widespread, but even past examples such as the Soviet Union or North Korea today realize there is a floor to deprivation. Even the replacement populations across Europe and North America will have limits.

                I’m not sure TPTB have considered there are any limits to immigration or deprivation. Their casual dismissal of the skills required to maintain a complex society will leave them baffled at the collapse caused by the disappearance of a competent work force. It would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic.

                            An interesting blast from the past. That movie perhaps cemented the prejudice against nuke power at the time. Entire plants in testing phase were shut down in that era costing consumers billions of dollars.  All new plants were cancelled.
The irony is that such plants are obsolete and current designs for new plants simply shut down—not melt down—if the worst happens as depicted in that farce of a movie—really a propaganda film against the nuke industry.

I wish I were as sure as you seem to be. My belief is that those limits are determined by the flow of free shit. If it stops, then perhaps their limits will have been reached. If not, well, they’re not referred to as “Los de abajo” (as in “deplorables”) for nothin’.  The upside is that most of the “foreign” ones (as in those in Europe) have begun approaching their limits and–miracle of miracles!–so have the natives. The US-domestics both native and foreign, not so much.

            I don’t know if the Secdef has the authority (legally) to order forces to deploy but really, in a country that fights wars without ever actually declaring war, I doubt it matters anymore. Of course, the movie Dr. Strangelove gives you an idea of what this kind of diffusion of power can lead to. Hopefully we don’t have any aspiring Gen. Rippers waiting to nuke Russia. Of course, one of the few advantages of having a military that values “inclusion” more than martial valor is that there’s probably no one with the balls to pull such a stunt.

        Well it was obvious from Day One that the Ukes were going to lose. The second I heard the crap about the Russians were all drunken thugs, their equipment was no good, and that their economic conditions were comparable to Spain… I knew it was all over. It got ever worse from there. The pics of Uke grannies and teenaged bubble gummers with AK47s that would water their flower gardens with Russian blood made MY blood boil. Add to that – the western penchant for debacles like Viet Nam, the Sandbox wars, and the sinfully incompetent retreat from Afghanistan… the Ukes never had a chance and it was obvious from the start.I don’t think the elites will simply grab their stolen billions and sail off into the sunset either. Marie Antoinette, Nicolae Ceausecu, a metric ton of WW2 era Nazis and Japs ended up dancing at the end of a rope after they failed. If Zelnskyy somehow escapes from the Kraine and survives the wrath of his own people… I am betting he’ll not survive long. The Russians will put an end to him.We are going into a new era. Targetted assassination is now on the table for everyone including us.

            All true. Also, if Zelensky somehow ends up in Britain or the States, either of those governments are as likely to put a bullet into him as the Russians are. I can envision his reputed allies doing that before he gets out and then blaming the Russians or Azov, whichever makes for better propaganda.

                I think a lot of people who have swung around at least intellectually on the “they want us dead” bit are still in denial.  Specifically, denial about what happens when a foreign war is used by a “Harris” administration to further domestic repression and dial the now-soft terror up a notch or five.A Trump DOJ might buy four more years of breathing space.  A DOJ headed by Letitia James will not.Take the obvious example: poor Pete B may find that setting up his keep 30 miles from one of the largest concentrations of FB1 agents in the country was Before Time thinking.

                If James Bamford’s bookSpyfailis accurate,then DJT will be working for the Israelis as his primary consideration.They want him as USA presidentto back them up against Iran. Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.Although Argentine President Milei is an unabashed “semitophile”, as is DJT, Milei has been getting necessary things done here domestically.  As for the global foreign policy/warfare sphere, the country may as well not exist. I see this as an advantage for the present. It most certainly isn’t for the USA, among the principal reasons I emigrated 25 years ago and landed up here, living the life of Reilly, to speak in terms of what is likely a long-forgotten metaphor. Let us hope that DJT takes this into consideration if he is elected. Nonetheless, with respect to Israel and his position vis-a-vis said country, the jury is still out. Vote for him as opposed to the other ticket, sure, but understanding the implications. Unless and until the Israeli factor is factored out, the USA and all who are plain-vanilla citizens thereof remain in jeopardy.

                    The Technocrat faction backing Trump is the Paypal Mafia; the fact that this Palantir faction is run by a gay jew, Peter Thiel, tells me the Diaspora will continue to call the shots no matter who is in charge.
Even a Trump needs powerful elite allies; we can only hope that moderates like a Trump and a Musk will exert a moderating effect for their people, that the Beast System will rush towards only a transhumanist future (that could have never happened without the whites!), and not necessarily towards a full genocide of the whites.

            I believe Trump can help delay the inevitable, but this country is doomed. Too many low-IQ ethnics, too much sexual perversion, an evil ruling class that hates the white people who built the country and too many people with the morality of prostitutes.

                People of Trump’s generation, and to an extent Gen X, do not understand true sexual perversion. Years ago on the defunct Salo Forum there was the fabled “GRIDS thread.” You can still find it online. Over the years I’ve tried to explain to other men the promiscuity of the homosexual male lifestyle and they refuse to believe it. You cannot do anything with such people.

                    A couple years ago, when monkeypox was spreading, a few people who caught it detailed the activities they engaged in before they contracted it, and the responses on then-Twitter were all like “wtf? People act like this?”. It was totally bizarre, degenerate, insane behavior to anyone who isn’t part of that group. The “we’re just like you/we just want to love” stuff was a conscious decision made by activists in the late 1980s or early 1990s, it was in a book, I think, that is not easy to find anymore. Movies like “Philadelphia” were made as part of this campaign.

                        If you’ve a passing history with the AIDS epidemic beginning in the early 80s and all the hoopla surrounding it, you’d recall that it was spread primarily by homos acting promiscuously. This is covered in RFK’sThe Real Anthony Fauci. Fauci consolidated his power over funding etc. over HIV and his performance with Covid-19 was virtually a repeat performance. AIDS was first discovered by researchers studying other diseases in fags (hepatitis, I think). When you engage in unprotected anal sex with multiple random strangers, take various dangerous recreational drugs, and do God knows what else to your body, you’re probably setting yourself up for all manner of health problems. M[onkey]Pox is only the latest one to hit the news, fanned by the power- and grant-seeking usual suspects.

                    It’s not that hard to explain to normal men. Tell them, picture if every woman you thought was hot wanted to bang you. Every single time you went to the bar you knew you were going to go home with a hottie. In those circumstances, how would you behave? That’s more or less what it’s like for a homo. That’s the big picture anyway. I don’t care to get into the finer points.

                        If only it were that simple. Gays are not just guys with crossed wiring. A cornerstone of their sexuality is getting off on the transgression of itself – that’s why so many of them are into extreme stuff on top of their homosexuality.

                            Its not just the “getting off on the transgression of itself”. Part of it is wiring, not so much “crossed wiring” from birth, rather tampered or short circuited wiring during fundamental stages of development.The percentage of homosexual adults molested in childhood through adolescence is staggering. They even joke in circle about the “uncles”.Tampering with normal burgeoning sexuality in the young will cause aberrations in sexuality or sexual mentality later in life.Homosexual advocates will say that these young people or children were simply pursuing their natural proclivities. These same people would ironically rail against the idea that a woman wearing a short skirt in a dingy bar wanted to be raped. It’s a perverse reversal of blaming the victim.Compare self-identifying molestation victim numbers in the homosexual vs. heterosexual populations and you will see why up to this point in the Christian West we have kept sexual deviants away from children.

                                As I’ve said for years: Gay men and lesbians reproduce by molestation. It’s a classic example of Satanic inversion.
No one was “born this way.”
Our Billy wasn’t born a criminal, Clarice. He was made one through years of systematic abuse. Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual. But his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.

                            The recent movie about Jeffrey Dahmer featured a fairly honest coverage of the “gay nightlife”. It’s sad that you have to watch a serial killer movie to get an honest look at the gay scene (bathhouses, anonymous sex, weird kinks). Even most of the people who watched that movie probably don’t get that the whole gay experience is sort of a vast rainbow of weird perversions.Long term couples who don’t do anything too weird (assuming you can get past the buttsecks) are the exception but are portrayed as the rule (“they just want to find a partner and get married like everyone”). Dahmer the cannibal was an outlier to be sure but he was merely at the extreme edge of a distribution of behaviors that are all pretty bizarre and sickening.

                            I’d add in the nature of the sexes. Women have never been “wired” as man have. Men are designed to have high amounts of sex, women are the gatekeepers.  Sex to men is something different than to women who have more at stake in the act, like child birth.
Now imagine a scenario where men react to other men as most men react to women.  In short, where are the homosexual gatekeepers?  Answer, there are none or few).  So the sex between homosexual men tends to be rampant and promiscuous in the extreme.

                    “People of Trump’s generation, and to an extent Gen X, do not understand true sexual perversion”
The West has been struggling with sexual promiscuity for perhaps all of the 20th century. However, before the Boomers it was all in the closet. The ever rising hemlines, etc were signs of problems. The bikini culture of the 1960’s was another warning.However, when the Boomers came of age, they embraced vice as virtue. Gen X has never known a different world. Such people have no moral authority to reign in more serious problems, nor can they imagine a world of extreme perversion.

                        There are a fair number of miserable marriages that are also -cold- where the wives perform mechanical sex only when absolutely required. Guess what? They cost a LOT more than a one and done with a paid professional. Read some forums describing this process from men talking about the “pity f-ck” they are given once every few months or once a year by disinterested wives.This is not a ringing endorsement of prostitution merely an observation that in many cases, you pay one way or another for ‘masturbation with a live prop’. For the vast majority of men in the West, the marriage contract is a sucker’s bet at BEST.

The Filipinos told me they’d go see the prostitute so they could pour out their problems with their wives to an understanding ear. Those working girls were marriage counselors.Wives in Reno sent their husbands to the Mustang Ranch when they were too pregnant to have relations.

                    We can learn by discipling ourselves on the personal fronts, including food/other impulses.As I mentioned the other day, as much as I admire Solzhenitsyn, he was writing up a fantasy of how the world works. He never took his own “advice”. By as early as the 1950’s the totalitarian impulses of the USSR had great softened. Writing a bunch of books is hardly leading the resistance.Solzhenitsyn also talked about not loving/thinking about God enough. That’s maybe more worthy of consideration.

        The recent Ukrainian excursion is basically the ardennes breakout: the last desperate gasp of a failing military strategy. Roll the dice, go for broke. After some initial success it is fated to turn out the same. After the Bulge the Wehrmacht never had a significant offensive again, and it was only a matter of time till the end. Of course the other lesson here is the leadership of Germany at that time decided to bring the county down with it. Imagine how things might have been different if that bomb under the table had managed to blow Hitler to bits…

            The “Battle of the Bulge” had more serious thinking and planning behind it than this half-assed venture. And of course vastly more resources allocated. But otherwise, yes, it’s the last gasp.

                It’s like the related Operation Bodenplatte that was the end of the Luftwaffe. Sure, they caught hundreds of Allied planes on the ground and destroyed them, but when American factories were producing 35 P-51s PER DAY, what did the loss of a few planes matter? It turned out to be a disaster for the Luftwaffe as they lost precious, irreplaceable pilots and aircraft for little gain.
This is a desperate, last-chance gambit by the Ukies to improve their hand at the negotiation table. Like most of these types of offensives, it is doomed to fail.

                    Luftwaffe was all but useless at that point, as they had more planes than they had the fuel or the pilots to fly. The world’s first jet fighter was taxied around the runways using mules, because there was no diesel for the tractors.The Germans fought to the last bullet because they had good reasons to believe that they’d be wiped out, Cartago-style, if they lost. Not only had Western leaders said that in public numerous times, but the murderous bombing war left little doubt as to the Allies’ intention towards the German Problem. Putin has made no similar threat to annihilate the Ukrainian people, so let’s hope this war will be over by Christmas.I doubt, though, that there’ll be a cushy pension awaiting Zelensky in Israel, considering the money and embarrassment he has cost his masters. He will be sacrificed like a chicken and carry their sins to his grave.

                        When I was a kid, my grandpa told me towards the end of the war, the Germans were sending teenaged boys out to fight. They had guns but little or no ammo. Iirc, he was in Grimma, Saxony, when the war ended, where they’d met the Soviets. He wouldn’t talk about what he saw there, but it was clear he hated Russians the rest of his life for it.I guess I get why the Germans would fight the Soviets to the last, but I don’t know why they didn’t surrender to the western powers. Not that we were so humane in war, but certainly we were kinder in peace. Morgenthau plan was a kind of German Reconstruction, I suppose, but cooler heads prevailed there, too. Sure beats expulsion, and whatever my grandpa wouldn’t talk about.

There’s that divide between West Europeans (German, Scandinavian, Austrian, French, British, Italian, Dutch, Belgian) on one side and Slav on the other And it showed itself in the way the Germans and Russians fought each other. That divide remains to the current day.

                            The surrender came once Hitler left the scene.  As with Zelenskyy, he had his mad adherents like theGestapoto maintain obedience/fear until the end.  And they did surrender, wherever possible, to the allies rather than the Russians—but there’s only so much you can do.  I have read numerous articles/discussions on divisions making their way West rather than East to escape Russian capture.

No doubt. Hence we went so hard after the oil refineries at Ploesti in Romania with a ruinous loss of bombers in several raids. Fisher-Tropsch process-sourced gasoline was a dead-end as well for the Germans.

                The Russians were bitter about this. Stalin pointedly asked Roosevelt at Yalta why Americans and Brits were insisting on unconditional surrender. The Russians wanted the fighting to stop and a change of leadership in Berlin, not some crazed, catastrophic struggle to the last German soldier. They also did not understand why we were bombing civilian ares to rubble when it would only complicate matters when the Germans finally did surrender. It seems American leadership continues to be led by the ghost of William Tecumseh Sherman.

            If Ukraine had a Heinz Guderian, he might actually have succeeded in the sprint to the Kursk NPP, captured it, surrounded it, and filled it with explosives thus turning it into the world’s largest dirty bomb. Then holding it hostage while negotiating with Moscow is a strong hand to play. So not a bad gambit, just lacking in the right leadership and some luck. Russia dodged a bullet IMHO.

                eh, I dunno, the superior German fighting man and the superior German organizational structure in which he worked made a lot of generals look like geniuses. Not to say that the generals were lacking, but in this case, it takes a village. Or rather, an army.

                    Guderian was one of the key people in the Wehrmacht that built the organization of which you speak. But it is said of great football coaches that they can take their team and beat yours, then take your team and beat theirs.

            I take it more as a Doolittle Raid as someone mentioned on Sev’s site. (You really should visit)An attack to show “Hey, we’re still in this thing!” And a desperate attempt to make one’s opponent pull troops from other areas and hopefully force a strategy change.The original Doolittle Raid, and the Battle of the Coral Sea, convinced the IJN to go “all in” on the Battle of Midway. Which was a close run thing.Of course, it WAS the available might of the USN vs. the IJN.In the case of Ukraine, what happens once this feint is pushed back costing troops, equipment, and supplies that couldn’t be spared? Does someone crack open some nuclear sunshine?

                Every day I get more scared that the answer is “yes.” That’s the kind of Very Clever move that would appeal to the Very Clever Boys running Biden…errr, Kamala, or, you know, whoever — hand Zelensky some tactical nukes, and whatever “he” “decides” to do with them, that’s his business! AINO’s Very Clever Boys come from the Monty Burns school of accountability: “I can’t be held responsible for what my goons were hired to do!”

It’s not as easy as it looks, apparently. The Russians only managed it successfully twice: At Khalkhin Gol and at Stalingrad.

                    The Americans/Canadians/British did not have the troops to put enough divisions in the way of the retreating German army group.
WW2 was not a computer game where you encircle an army group with a couple of divisions.
It wasn’t failure it was a wise choice. The troops plugging the hole would have been slaughtered.

            Severian posted some graphs a few days ago showing past incursions and their result. The usual result of these things, when the defenders are stronger than the attackers, is that the defenders move in to cut of the salient, surround it, and then destroy it at leisure. Part of me wonders if the Russians actually baited the Ukies into doing this so that they could justify refusing to talk to Zelensky. Of course, they can’t admit that because it would mean they were being irresponsible with the lives of their own people around Kursk.Of course, we all know that “4D chess” explanations are seldom right. Talk about narratives though. Most Americans don’t know Kursk from ketchup but every Russian knows exactly what happened there in WWII.

            To Ukraine and it’s Western fluffers, the Kursk incursion is a great success because it ‘humiliated Putin’.  Nearly every mainstream article I’ve read about the situation has cited this while spinning their narrative.  If you can’t win a real war, win an imaginary one.

            Very unlikely. The CIA-backed psy-op to push anti-Russian hatred has been going on for decades and has been very, very successful. Galicians (i.e., the only people that actually spoke proper Ukrainian before their government began mandating it) absolutely hate, hate, hate Russians. This is why it is so easy for them to find volunteers for these suicide missions. These men would gladly die if it gives them one opportunity to terrorize and murder ethnic Russian civilians.

                It’s an American fantasy that the people of former Soviet countries are anti-communist. Not many more than the few who went to the trouble to “defect” are. But they do hate Russians—and not the kind of Russians who ruled them.
They learned from those masters: The more powerless the Russian, the more they hate him. They relish the deaths of innocents caught on the wrong side of a moving border, of “meatgrinder” conscripts and unsuspecting beachgoers.

        What I found to be the most indicative of Russia as a serious nation is that Putin relieved of command the generals who have failed in this war, something AINO has not done for well over 80 years, when generals and admirals found wanting in 1941 and 1942 were ruthlessly culled. Since 1944, US military failure is rewarded, not punished.

        I was listening to Scott Ritter this morning before coming here. Scott said that the Russians view the incursion into Kursk as a NATO invasion, because without US and NATO equipment and space-based surveillance, it would not have been possible. Apparently, according to one of Scott’s well-placed sources inside Russia, the military high command in Moscow is readying something very big to rid itself of the criminal gang in Kiev. Scott further stated that Russia is going to definitely take Odessa, Karkhov, and perhaps Kiev itself now that it no longer sees any point to negotiating with the West. It sounds like we should strap in for something spectacular over the horizon with regard to Ukraine.

                I question if such offensives are possible in the face of current year integrated battlefield ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Aquisition, Reconnaissance). We likely would have seen them already if they were. Of course the Ukes pulled a little one here, but Russia is at an ISTAR disadvantage to the GAE. That’s just a fact. Anyhow, if Ritter knows it’s coming, so does the GAE. So just a question if they are still packing enough ordnance and men to defend.

                    You can have all the satellite intelligence that the GAE can feed you, but it’s for nothing if you’ve no weaponry to reach out and stop the enemy.  Uke’s have little to nothing left, and certainly have never controlled the air since the initial incursion.

                        We’ve been over that here ad nauseam of course, but the facts on the ground say that so far, they’ve had enough to fight a successful defensive war. Maybe that is about to break here in the next month or three, maybe they are about to falter, maybe the denouement is finally coming, but none of that has happened yet.

                            They fight a defensive war because Russia allows them to.  The strategy has never been to overwhelm and penetrate, simply to chew them up, while defending the newly annexed Russian speaking “oblasts”.  For this entire year, the Uke’s have lost every objective the Russians have attacked.Because there are no deep penetrating offensives, the Uke’s are allowed to spread themselves out and fight along an 800 mile front.  Mount a major offensive against an inner objective.  Example, launch an attack fromBelarustowards the interior and open up a new front, and the Uke’s will crumble as they pull forces from the attack upon the oblasts.Oddly enough, the above tactic has been used recently by the Uke’s in their attack upon the Kursk region, as in a lightly defended area with little more than border guards.  An attack that was stopped within days, since it was nothing more than a PR distraction and the Russians have plenty of reserves to stop these sideshows.If the Russians had used their current tactics against the Germans in WWII, we’d still be fighting in the East.

            I’m unfamiliar with Mr. Ritter, but my innate skepticism requires me to think “blogger = journalist” and thus a profit motive. He has a market and that market wants stories. Now I ask you, just as a naïve guess, what is the probability that any Western hack would have a highly placed source in Russia? Pretty close to zero. And even if he did, “something big coming up” would be standard propaganda. Mr, Ritter may offer up entertainment, but hard info? Color me a doubter. Why would anyone believe his alleged source any more than the “sources” Regime media always whispers of? It’s all bullshit until proven otherwise.

                You don’t know Ritter.  He’s retired Army and was the chief UN arms inspector in Iraq.  He is wined and dined by the Russians, hence his current troubles with the FBI investigating him as an unregistered foreign agent.  Last week they raided his home in NY.
There are many reasons to suspect Ritter of shenanigans, but he’s not a simple, ignorant blogger.  He has “street cred’s” as they say.  I don’t particularly trust him as I can’t get my head around such a close relation to Russian military from a (retired) US military officer.

            One frightening thought is that a constrained Putin is actually working (reluctantly) for the other side, slow-walking the war so as to kill more Slavs.
Just as a constrained Trump and Musk are forced to work for the other side, in the end, as it’s unescapable.

        In a weird way, the Ukraine tragedy shows that people will eat buckets of crap when their ruling Elites provide a compelling narrative for warfare, civil or external. It doesn’t exactly make me wildly optimistic about what’s coming for the US. You’d have thought that the Ukes would have already marched on Kiev with pitchforks and torches. So you can easily envision an army of Cat Ladies burning churches and hanging GOP leaders if the lunatics here gain unrestricted power.

            The willingness of the Ukes to die for king and country is the remarkable thing. Because I cannot imagine an army of cat ladies doing anything of the sort, nor an army of grillers. Both those groups are glued to the sail foam. The cat ladies will snark and cheer as the white men in the employ of the security state vanquish their enemies, but they damn sure aren’t going to participate in any more meaningful way than waving signs and signaling their own virtue and obeisance to the regime.

                Ukraine’s sacrificial lambs are the rare exception and not the rule across the board and across time. The cat ladies and grillers who seamlessly move from one New Thing to the next New Thing yet never lift a finger are the norm. It is likely the United States itself goes out in a nuclear blaze of glory because literally no one with brains and/or courage would die for it in a conventional war now and because it is led by psychopathic trash. If mushroom clouds are avoided with this debacle, it will have been due to Russian indulgence. There are others with nukes just as crazy as the United States, of course, and there will be a Last Time, which if not this time could be the next time.

                “The willingness of the Ukes to die for king and country is the remarkable thing.”Is it a thing at all? Let’s take a contra position. War begins, half the country flees to the EU. Standing army is huge (est 600k) so the fighting begins. Even with the SMO of less than 100K in action, Uke’s give way. Ukes then counter attack and Russians rethink the war aims. After the Russians wake up, quadruple their forces, there are hundreds of thousands of dead Uke’s and no further Ukrainian progress on battlefield—rather the opposite.Ukraine begins to use “press gangs” to round up new cannon fodder and Zelenskyy has to strike deals with EU to “repatriate” military age men. Meanwhile, Russia avoids military action specifically designed to affect non-military Uke’s—like electrical grid. Russians do not strike shipments of civilian supplies. They even allow Uke commerce from ports on Black Sea. Ukrainian populace is not affected by war as was Europe in previous wars, with the exception of endless funerals to attend.Lately, no progress in obtaining negotiations, Russian capital gets droned and the Uke electrical grid is attacked. Most of Ukraine now rations electricity to a few hours per day, and rely on electrical imports from Poland. Exports and commerce ends for Uke’s. Pressure to end war builds from populace, but is met with Uke secret police. Example, Gonzalo Lira, an American blogger, is imprisoned and dies from maltreatment there. Elections are cancelled and Zelenskyy assumes dictatorial power.Meanwhile, rumors are that new Uke recruits are given minimal training and send to the front to die quickly.  Videos circulate of Uke commanders surrendering rather than allow their men to be slaughtered through command incompetence and neglect. Russian policy of good treatment to soldiers surrendering seems to be effective PR.Can we really judge the “willingness” of the population in this war? 1) They’ve not experienced it until late. 2) They are scared and repressed from expressing their opinion on the war.In WWII, the Russians put up a pretty good front against the Germans once Stalin instituted a “no retreat” order backed by KGB forces behind the front line with machine guns and orders to shoot any Russian conscript who retreated or surrendered.  I see little difference here.

                    They even allow Uke commerce from ports on Black Sea.And Ukraine allows Russia to use pipelines running through Ukraine to sell gas to Europe. Pursuant the Hollywood Theory of Reality, it’s almost as if both sides are reading from the same script.The Russians put up a pretty good front against the Germans once Stalin instituted a “no retreat” order backed by KGB forcesThe strategy of using NKVD barricade troops to secure the valor of troops, was a disastrous failure, starting with the Winter War, where green, Finnish recruits reportedly wept with horror as they mowed down terrified waves of Russians caught between Finnish and NKVD machine guns. Terror can make soldiers advance, but it can’t make them fight.The Russians only started to fight well when the politruks were retired and the military was allowed to manoeuver, and when, simultaneously, the agitprop started to use defense of the Motherland, rather than the victory of Communism as a motivator.

                        No argument here, butmanoeuver at the army command level is different from front line attack in battle.  Hitler made the same mistake in his “no retreat” order to Paulus and lost an army group.  Not sure a “hands off” approach wrt the military would have solved the issue of Russian mass surrender without much in the way of resistance.

                            The problem with the early mass surrenders was that the Russians were not allowed to retreat out of the German envelopments, even if they knew they were being surrounded.The issue of barricade units seem to be somewhat exaggerated, and were only used on scale during the Winter War. Sure, there were NKVD-troops in the rear areas throughout the war, shooting deserters, but that was the case in Germany too, and even in the US, although American didn’t shoot deserters on the spot.As to Paulus, I don’t believe he had a stand fast-order, rather than being caught by surprise, thinking he had everything under control. Nobody suspected that the Russians could pull such a masterpiece out of a hat, and once he realized his mistake, the jaws of the trap had shut.

                    In the obviously fictional novelThe Third World War: August 1985which I read with interest as I was stationed in Germany the early 1980s, yes that point is mentioned. When the war breaks out, the front line Soviet troops know they have the KGB battalions behind them to discourage deserters. When the shooting begins, the frontline Soviets do an about face and become the Allied Vanguard attacking the Soviets. Realistic? I don’t know.

            “Grass roots” revolution is myth sold in part by the Jewish media. The eternal rebels love the idea that the peasants will be overthrowing the lords, the earthly equivalent of their spiritual rebellion. America is stable and sane because they take that to be fantasy that it is.I’m sure the Ukraines have resisted as much as they could. However, this is not the first time the Jews have made the land a mass grave, rather than a country.

        Everything in AINO now reminds me of the “Do Long Bridge” scene fromApocalypse Now. There ain’t no fuckin’ CO. It’s every little pissant with a scrap of power doing his own thing, totally without reference to anyone or anything else. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to learn that some major decisions were made in / by / for Ukraine that were really all about bureaucratic turf fights between two desk jockeys somewhere in the basement of the State Department.

        The USA’s behavior with regards to this operation is totally nonsensical, until you look at the people who have been making the decisions and realize this is simply the latest chapter in a long story of hatred and resentment that goes back to the Pale of Settlement. With that in mind, I find it hard to believe that the people in charge will be willing to cut their tribal brethren loose in order to appease their hated enemy. I just don’t see it. Somebody else – somebody competent and acting in the interests of our country – has to take the reins first.

        Yes, it’s time to start thinking about nuts &amp; bolts. LEOs will be thrown into the fray as a first line of defense; and just as in Ukraine, a lot of good white guys will face off against other good white guys. The elites want mutual slaughter. Then will come the NG guys, mostly used for rounding up the “insurrectionists.” Again, manufactured mutual slaughter. Last will be the Jackboot Corp comprised of mercenary invaders. At that point, it’s all about population reduction via genocide. But we don’t have to suffer the same fate as Ukraine. Straight to the source of the problem. FPVs are a gamechanger. And its in our wheelhouse. Smarter, not harder.

        Here’s a data point that I’ve never seen before:  I get Reservists called up for orders all the time.  As an employer, we’re required by law to let them leave, no questions asked, and give them their job back (or something similar) when they retire.  I see these military orders a lot in my job.But until today, I had never seen orders for someone to report for an Inactive Ready Reserve “muster”.  The IRR is what you transfer into if you leave (not retire) from the military, and you don’t join your local Guard/Reserve unit.Id be interested to know if anyone else has seen this, and whether it is common in your area.  I found it odd and unsettling.My gut tells me war, a very big war, is coming later this year or early next.  A friend has a son entering Navy ROTC this summer.  His boy was told, point blank, you’re going to war with China in 2027.  So you better be here for the right reason.The ruling class can’t risk Trump dismantling this disaster.

        In the major media the past few weeks has been news of Ukraine’s impressive attacks on Kursk and other Russian soil. No one can be certain what’s true since the mainstream media is rightly suspected of being full of Regime propaganda. That the incursion is not fake news would seem supported by the “Other Side” (sample provided by Russia Today) that discusses the incursion. Mine is only a quick snapshot provided by competing headlines; I’m not attempting to find the detailed story, but to intuit what the two sides are claiming as their perspectives.That Ukraine invaded Mother Russia seems true beyond reasonable doubt; the only questions remain the details: to what degree, how successfully, was Russia taken unawares, and so forth.Within less than two months I’ve seen: the outgoing President long suspected of senility prove it outright during a live political debate; his abrupt decision to not stand for re-election delivered under most unusual circumstances; the appointment of an even worse stand-in for him; the opposition candidate missing an assassin’s bullet by mere centimeters; and who knows what else.Zman mentions the hundreds of billions sent to the Ukraine project. It’s worth speculating that a lot of those funds never reach the front. What portions of it vanishes into the “overhead” is anyone’s guess. I would guess most of it does. In addition to the perennial favorite “Ten percent for the Big Guy,” there are the endless middlemen whose palms must be greased, the intelligence agencies taking their cut, and miscellaneous miscreants. Even when materiel is sent, surely a large fraction of it diverts into the black market, ironically some of it finding its way into the hands of American’s “enemies.” The latest allegation but one by no means lacking credibility is the claim that a lot of the Ukraine funding is a de-facto money laundering operation. A lot of that money comes back to America to buy politicians.We surely live in entertaining times. This may be political theater, but it’s the theater of the absurd. Whatever dismal future awaits us plebs, we can at least hope neither side gets the itch to open up the canned sunshine.

        Let me add, the Ruling Elite lives in its own narrative with risks inherent on that strategy. Pelosi and Obama pushed out Biden, but he and his followers are still in the White House. Angry. With Hunter knowing he is the designated fall guy and come his daddy’s exit from the White House he loses all protection.Hmm … what could possibly go wrong there? The smart move would have been to make Harris the President immediately, but that would have been messy. To win the narrative they pushed ol Poopin Joe out, but he still has months to go as President. Where he can  (and probably will via Hunter) make trouble.Moreover there is revealed preference. The Ruling Elite did not want to chance Harris as President too early. Its like people seeing the Girl Boss posters for Furiosa, or the Marvels, and saying no thanks. Even the hint at Girl Bossery repels audiences even as it thrills Hollywood execs. Same here. If even Pelosi could not stomach President Harris now, why vote for the chief airhead. [Related, more and more Silicon Valley VCs are jumping on the Trump train, with all the risks if Trump loses to them personally, another went Trump and noted Lesbian Journalist Kara Swisher tried to cancel him. If even people like Ray Dalio are gambling on Trump despite the risks, what does that tell you about confidence in the Regime?]

        To most people here in Finland, and I assume in most of the West it seems the war in Ukraine is a safe feel-good entertainment that they can enjoy from the comfort of their couch. Any mildest suggestion of peace through negotiations provokes a similar reaction as though you’d just proposed their favorite sportsball league be shut down.

        Seems unlikely that the purpose of the Kursk attack was the NPP. Probably it was a preemptive attack to disrupt the upcoming Russian offensive against Sumy, which had been rumored for months to follow up on the Kharkov offensive. RU was reportedly demining the roads in the area. So UA rushed in as the castle gate was opened for a sally out, so to speak.Hard to say if it was a smart move or not. The entire point of a Russian attack on Sumy would be the extension of the front line, to stretch UA and force them to pull troops from the east, which has now happened anyway.

                If our current elites wanted to destroy Musk, they’d stop showering him with subsidies and they wouldn’t allow him to pollute low-earth orbit with 40,000 new birds that were financed by an unsecured pyramid scheme. He wouldn’t have big institutional investors pour tens of millions into his little car shop andhe wouldn’t be mentioned by Jewstream media at all. In fact, he’d be in jail for SEC fraud.Wait, what’s this? Musk just landed a CIA contract to build them a new network of spy satellites? Hmmm….https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/musks-spacex-is-building-spy-satellite-network-us-intelligence-agency-sources-2024-03-16/Musk is just playing the role of the villain, which requires that the regime media say the obligatory “Rocket Man Bad”-line.

            I think one is forming up. They aren’t our guys, exactly, but they are a broad swath of rich people and other influencers who hate the woke/DEI stuff. Others just hate leftists, and others just like Trump and what he represents.I also think what you see in the MSM and party politics is largely being ignored anyway, by the “real” PTB. Those two dying entities feed each other and they still have legacy eyeballs (like boomers and normies) but they’re probably no more popular than Major League Baseball. In time, our transnational capitalist elite will be calling the shots, and the Washington establishment will be merely a tool and a joke.

                    They hate DEI because they’re worried that revolution will turn on them.
(at least arguably, DEI/woke was a narrative created by the current elite as cover from the previous, OWS revolution).

                        We don’t remember what Occupy was like.The Great Awokening (or whatever) immediately followed OWS becauseOWSmodeled a society explicitly premised on anti-whiteness. It was a “teach-in”—a demonstration of how to proceed, a corporate seminar. Go back and watch the videos. It wasn’tanykind of protest, let alone a last stand of Real Leftism that worried the “They.”What we call leftism is a social, non-ideological phenomenon. It’s local and mimetic, people who know each other copying each other. Word goes out, but not through ideas and arguments (hence their powerlessness in defense).Our Democracy is elite hysteria desperately mimicked by a status-insecure mass. The everyday analogies are fashion, high school, “mean girls,” etc. It’s not about the money—because your parents’ class has decided yours already. The daughter isworriedthat her prom date is too white. Dad and third wife are on a borrowed yacht, grotesque in their swimwear, throwing water at each other.

I think you have this backwards.  They already wrecked their business when they took on unsupportable amounts of debt to consolidate the market into corporate hands.  I think they don’t give a shit about DEI stuff, the only thing they care about is bailout money when the time comes.  If they have to say men can give birth to obtain that money they will.

                            It’s like the old joke about did capital take over government or vice versa. Closer to reality would seem to be they largely bought each other ought, or are basically the same people/entities. In the not-so-long ago times, this was called a government-business partnership, corporatism, and fascism. The present lumpenproletariat of Western nations is so dim they would never believe anyone could be a “fascist” if he’s not goose-stepping and cranking out lampshades and bars of soap made from certain minority groups.

                It’s not so much that they hate the DEI/woke stuff, it’s that they see the revolution coming for them. The Brandon regime is just blatantly anti-White, anti-work, pro-spiteful mutant and even a White-adjacent person can see what’s on the horizon if these people stay in charge. Zuckerberg gave hundreds of millions of dollars to “fortify” the 2020 election and is now sitting this one out for exactly this reason. It’s totally in self-interest, which, of course, is how it always goes.

                        Well, yes and no. For the sake of my argument, let us say that Woke = Early 20th century Marxism/Socialism/Communism. It’s been said by someone, and I think it a valid claim, that early Soviet Communism hoped to export the revolution internationally. By the traditional canon, the workers were supposed to rise up and overthrow the owners of capital. For whatever reasons, that plan largely failed. Whatdidsucceed and spectacularly, over long periods of time, was the cultural Marxism largely spread by the Diaspora from Eastern Europe and Russia who brought many skills to the West, but on the whole they also brought Marxism in its various disguises. And now, four or five generations later, we are bearing much of its bitter fruit.

                            Ostei here set me straight long ago on the difference between PoMo and Gramscian cultural Marxism, so, yeah. But wealth seizure and asset forfeiture isn’t limited to Marxism of any stripe, and there does seem to be quite a bit of concern over an economic deconstruction on the heels of the cultural counterpart. That seems to be a valid concern, too. The replacement population won’t pay for itself and isn’t expected to do so.

                    The ones who know a bit of 20th century history may also be aware that Leftist revolutions (and that is essentially what’s been going on) have a nasty habit of devouring their own most aggressive supporters.

        In all the talk about the need to destroy Iran, I’ve seen no discussion about what happens when Iran close the Straits of Hormuz and 25$ of World oil production stops flowing.A perfect example of the utter fecklessness of the fuckers.

            China, which receives more total barrels through Hormuz than anyone else, probably wouldn’t let them do it, is my guess

        I have read that the Kursk salient was the work of the UK, which largely planned it and carried it out with sheep-dipped UK military. If so, that would explain a lot of things.Moreover, Western policy makers believe the media, instead of reality. So the Kursk salient is already a great success, and the media is trumpeting that Ukraine will soon be marching on Moscow. This means that the US and UK and EU will be re-inforcing Ukraine with the belief that victory over the Russians and Regime Change in Moscow is a certainty.Which means the draft boys, its coming. A massive one, with straight White men only of course, sent to the Russian Front. If Biden wants his revenge (and if Hunter wants his, more stuff leaking out as he realizes he will be the fall guy and not Ryan Gosling or Lee Majors) — he could even have that running out in September. Just as a F- you very much gift to Nancy.

Based on the radio traffic reported by Russia I’d bet a lot of sheep-dipped Frenchies and Polacks are also in Kursk.

            I had an employee today tell me she got ordered to report for an Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) muster next month.  I found that really odd.  The IRR is just former military who didn’t retire and didn’t join the Guard/Reserves.  The IRR is the reserves to the reserves.
As a Reserve Officer, I was on IRR status for 10 years (throughout the GWOT), and not once was I or anyone else on IRR called to “muster”.
something is coming.

        Is that how first-order thinking works, then?  You make up something, and then you have to make up something else in order to along with it, and then you have to make up something else to go along withthat,and then you…

            Sounds remarkably like a certain demographic here that is well known for not being able to grasp the likely consequences of actions. Perhaps the technical term is first-order thinking, but I would term it “out of order thinking.”

            I believe the term of art is Moronic Markov Process. The softer formulation grokkable by Regime acolyte striver readers of the Economist/FT would be something like Stochastic Solipsism.

        “For a little over a year, it has been clear to people who have followed the war in Ukraine that there is no winning scenario for Ukraine.”I’ve watched the war since the beginning in 2014. I’ve watched Putin since he took power in 1999. You are wrong. At this point, Russia wins only if they use nukes, and by doing so they still lose. They are already a pariah state again, and even those closest to Russia, China and India, have strongly warned Putin off nukes.Russia has had over 600K casualties, and is rounding up immigrants to send to the font for lack of warm bodies. The war is not going well for Russia. Even maintaining their rail rolling stock has become questionable because of the lack of parts that have historically ben imported. Sanctions have also been biting deeply.Your article is not connected to reality.

        One thing to bear in mind if Ukraine collapses is all the Azoz &amp; Ukrainian SS/Bandera types fleeing west to escape Russian prosecution. They will spread throughout Europe with their ideology…and weapons, and experience…and lead and organize the European “far right”. Much like Al-Qaeda moving into Syria after leaving Afghanistan.
