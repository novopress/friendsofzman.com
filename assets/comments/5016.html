        The trend is toward a centralized control of the economy for the benefit of big companies and politicians. Companies have the benefit of limiting competitors with onerous rules and regulations. And politicians count on the larger companies for campaign contributions and jobs after their time in office.When an upstart like Uber or AirBNB enters the market, upending the established order, you can feel the fear of the entrenched companies and politician losing control to individuals. Thus they will fight as hard as they can. And they do it with onerous rules and regulations and taxes which strangle the small entrepreneurs.

            I don’t think any of those are upending much of anything. Both look like old fashioned skimming operations.

        The Grumpy Economist writes inRule of Law in the Regulatory State:“The Dodd-Frank act is 2,300 pages of legislation, in which “systemic” is never defined, making a “systemic” designation nearly impossible to fight. The act has given rise to tens of thousands of pages of subsidiary regulation, much still to be written. The Volker rule alone — do not fund proprietary trading with insured deposits — runs now to nearly 1,000 pages.To call this Talmudic is to insult the clarity and concision of the Talmud.”Found viaThe Learning Diary of an Israeli Water Engineer:Where it isn’t much better, he writes himself:“I call my self a water engineer but deep down I am in the permitting business.”We could really change entrepreneur to “permiteur” at this point…

        Anyone who has even considered starting a small business today knows that the regulatory state is openly hostile to small businesses, and so is the tax code.

        ‘Offer no show jobs’ is an interesting idea, and one I suspect we will see in the UK soon. I learned today that the EU is going to provide cash for training unemployable immigrants, which not only cements the presence of the many who are forcing their way on to lorries and rail wagons to get into the UK but adds an extra slap in the face to unemployed (and probably unemployable) British workers. The EU, having taken money off the British people who live here legally, can now generously fund the lives of illegal immigrants with the cash they grabbed.I expect, as a good number of the illegal immigrants merely want a slice of the benefits pie they have heard so much about, that they could even turn into no-show workers. It wouldn’t surprise me if the next step is to grant large companies tax-breaks for ’employing’ no-show illegal immigrants.But we shouldn’t worry. It is, I am told, all in the interests of fairness.
