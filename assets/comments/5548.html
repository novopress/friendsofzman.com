        […] As many conservatives have noted, the Republican Party is not conservative; it’s just the slightly more bottom-line conscious version of the Democrat party. For the past several decades, after making ineffectual clucking noises about costs, it’s pretty much rubber-stamped everything Democrats want, a trend that’s accelerated under Obama. If you want a funny, profane, astute analysis of the “differences” between the parties, check this out. […]

        “Miss South Carolina with a penis.”  Very witty, and largely true.
But I couldn’t even watch the whole video of that brainless wench.  A body and face that won’t stop, but how do you get the mouth to stop – for more than a few minutes a day, while otherwise occupied?  :&gt;)

        Surely Mr. Rubio (et al.) will understand why I missed the vote for any of the old school GOP folk.Surely the “pundits” that “they” call “important” experts, will understand why I dismiss their “explaination” of “A vote for X= a vote for Y!!!”.There’s only ONE “poll” that matters. It’s the only civil response I have totheir “leadership experience”   credentials.

                Talk about rope to hang yourself with.The Corollary to her great Axiom as Ms. Ann Barnhardt said “…the only thing that actually WANTS to be in a cesspit is a PIECE OF SHIT regarding people who want to get elected and the psychopathic tendencies within todays political class.What’s funny about it is nobody saw Trump coming because the fuckers created a monster nobody believed was possible. Trump is like unintended consequences.The great thing about Trump Ms. Barnhardt’s axiom not withstanding, is he is the great fuck you no matter what, Trump is a win win no matter what.When he is elected and he ends up like the axiom portends, or he somehow fails in his bid, or they put a bullet through his head, and it doesn’t matter what becomes of Trump, it all begins to really dawn on enough people, and they become sorely disenchanted by the outcome in any of the possible eventualities, that mass of tolerance out there comes to a fucking screeching halt, that’s when the party really starts.Trump signifies the end of an age of America no matter what. Hard to say what the next epoch is like.What is wigging the fuckers out is they are in a serious pickle as Trump has turned the dynamic of the statist quo on its head. Trump represents a pivotal fuck you of penultimate scale and potential. They say Trump moved the Overton window to the right. Naw, what the potential here represents is a wrecking ball demolished the building the Overton window was in.It isn’t Trump, it is us we are voting for this time and there is not a damn thing the fuckers can do to stop it. Trump is the destiny of liberty writ large. We just grew up a little bit as a nation of people.Trump is nothing really in the larger scope, and that nothing is what the entire ruling class just became.You’ll see.Trump isn’t really The Great Fuckyou, The Great Fuck you is what made Trump possible. That Great Fuck You is The Great Fulcrum of Liberty, and God has the lever in his hands.The fuckers are in a no win situation. There is nothing for it. Their Overton window is a shattered pile of debris beneath a collapsed monument of hubris and greed.You’ll see.Its going to take a little time for everyone to grasp the enormity of what is happening to sink in.It all couldn’t have happened in a better way.Billy Beck was right, TINVOWOOT – (there is no voting our way out of this, and people become manifest in that).And that is a great thing indeed.

        The republican party is irrelevant.They hate Cruz because he had the balls to expose the sham, the fraud that is the good old boys republican network in congress.They hate Trump because he will do likewise; break up the clubby elites that is the republican party.The republicans are to  democrats as communists are to nationalist socialists; first cousins, contemptuous of the unwashed masses.The states should begin now to seriously consider seceding from our long gone Constitutional Republic. “Our” govt. is basically run by the elitist , left wing bureaucracy that that is accountable to no one and that imposes, with no consideration of the people’s will, regulations and rules that for all intents and purposes are laws.The democrats – socialists and communists – are all for this and they make no bones about it.The republicans are too, despite their phony protestations (on that rare occasion).If a democrat (read, communist or socialist) becomes president, the states should secede from the union. There really is no other way to regain our freedoms.

        Well this last act of Treachery by the Republicans is the final straw for me. I’ll vote for Trump and that is pretty much it. If Trump decided to go third Party, I’m with him.The Republicans are just a lighter version of the Democrats.We can go over Niagra Fall in a speed boat (The Democrats) or in a canoe (The Republicans) but the results are the same, a pending disaster. I’ll just sit back and watch the implosion of the Country.

        The GOP has wasted itself trying to win over its enemies. That was never and will never be a winning strategy.What the GOP needs to do and still can do is to attack and tear apart its enemies. That will not only consolidate its base but it will drag over the semi-committed voter who will choose the shiniest candidate.But who am I kidding? They aren’t focussed on winning the fight, merely on retaining their own gravy train. If they smile and say the right thing they will be taken care of by the ones who put them there. Heaven forbid they might fail gracefully at something they believe in and go back to their uncle’s law firm in Bilgewater County.

        Here’s another example of our owncheese eating surrender monkeys,in action:“Under Republican legislation sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, the federal government may delay the sale of a firearm to someone on the watch list for up to 72 hours. During that time, if the government can show a judge there’s ‘probable cause’ — the same legal standard used to obtain a search warrant — that the individual is plotting terrorism, then the gun sale is denied outright.”Wait. What? That still means . . .No due process! The prohibited buyer has no ability to confront his accuser. Make his case. Defend his rights. And what’s the bet that the “compromise” legislation contains the same secrecy clause as the original “terrorist loophole” bill. (The government is allowed to exclude “sensitive” information in its submission to the judge.)And what happens if the prohibited person wants to appeal the decision? And if an aspiring gun buyer is plotting terrorism, why the hell is he on the streets? Unless the feds want him there . . .The measure received 55 votes in the Senate. It it secured the backing of staunch conservatives likeTed Cruz, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubioas well as moderate Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly.The only Republican to oppose it was Mark Kirk.When gun rights advocates say “no compromise” this is exactly the kind of degradation of their rights they are guarding against. And rightly so. [h/t DrVino]”http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/12/robert-farago/republican-compromise-on-no-fly-list-gun-ban-revealed/Notice that when the nutless bedwetters that make up Republican officialdommake a deal, they never get anything in exchange for whatever they give up to the progs. Always something for nothing.AWatch Listwith Lois Lerner II in charge. That’ll be grand.Every member of the NRA and anyone who reads the Zman will be on itYes, like Lucy and her football, but these days even more like Benedict Arnold and the plans to West Point.…

                Cruz is the most fringe establishment candidate. But at the end of the day he is still establishment.
Also, Cruz promising to thwart Ryan wouldn’t do a lick of good. We’ve seen this dance before. Trump stakes out a populist/radical position, all the other candidates shudder, but when they see his poll numbers rise they adopt it as well. The public isn’t fooled, and their poll numbers don’t move much.

        I know of one strong conservative in elected Washington office who has gone very quiet the last couple of years or so. By accident being at the right place at the right time, I am aware of a rather convoluted financial situation that he finds himself in, that could be used to ruin his career. I am convinced that close to 100% of our elected officials are secretly compromised in some way or another, and it is constantly held over their heads, to ensure compliance with “the powers that be”.  We live under a thoroughly corrupt government.
