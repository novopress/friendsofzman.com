        I hate to be that guy, but the feminization of American politics has destroyed second-order policy thinking. Just as birth control/abortion removed the female need for second-order thinking in their personal lives, the emotive politics and the “gender gap” arising from women’s political involvement have destroyed it in the public policy sphere. The AWFLs and HR cubicle cat-lady politics of this era are living proof of this. Most White men still live in the world of budgets, compound interest, family court and thermodynamics – all second-order constructs.

            Absolutely…and that is why the EU, ruled almost exclusively by women, is going down the drain pretty rapidly…They prioritize Ukraine, 3d world emigration and their Gaian “climate change” fantasies, all backed by enormous spending that is wrecking their economies and political systems…But they will continue until the EU collapses or the proles finally overthrow them….

        If you ask me, I think (((they))) just demonstrated to everybody in vivid detail exactly why Iran should have nukes. Without nukes, Iran remains exposed to the whims of the current day Evil Empire and its greatest ally. If Iran doesn’t protect themselves, they’ll get another Shah shoved down their throats before they know it.

                        Short term thinking! Iran will sell it to others to buy support. Tactical nukes will break out of the gaping non-proliferation fence, and get normalized in an age of drones. AQ Khan of Pakistan already did this.
Of course, if we want to reduce that burgeoning population…letting South West/Central Asia turn themselves into a sea of microbes would be a pretty nice outcome.
Heck, we should set up the biolabs there, since that’s where most of the live organ-harvesting warehouses are.

                I had the misfortune of overhearing the first few minutes of Sean Hannity’s radio program this afternoon. Anything that he says is pure Ingsoc. He was using his opening segment to lay out the “irrefutable” case for preventing Iran from developing nuclear weaponsby any means necessary.Because “we all know” what the mullahs will do with them, right? How dare Iran pursue a self-serving defence and national security policy! What crazy country would do that?
Meanwhile, the nuclear scoreboard still reads: actual use of nuclear weapons – USA 2, rest of world 0.

                    I wonder what’s the scoreboard for GAE military adventures of which Hannity approves vs ones he doesn’t. Not having kept careful track over the years, it wouldn’t surprise me if he has backed all “Republican” wars while expressing skepticism about all “Democrat” ones. It also wouldn’t surprise me if he’s been bipartisan in his support of all of them. What would surprise me is independent thinking.

                        Sadly I spent more time than I should have on editing the previous comment. It all got ejected by the time limit. There was a whole lot more I wanted to say, only peripherally about Hannity, who is an NPC stooge. Of course, his (considerable) income stream is a function of his “flexible” convictions, not of what his tiresome intro calls “bold and inspired solutions for America.” Hannity is one of the best arguments for not being a conservative…In this context, I would like to ask him what, specifically, would be the “any means necessary.” Nuclear? But Israel has never claimed that it has nuclear weapons. In the eighty years since 1945, there hasn’t been a nuclear attack by any country whatsoever, and this is because countries that join the nuclear club broadcast it to the world.It’s not supposed to be a threat,It’s a deterrent.If the “Sampson Option” is real, then Israel, vis a vis Iran, stands in an asymmetric military relationship with them. If I were an Iranian, quite aside from my attitude toward the mullahs, I would not be happy about this. Where does a small and belligerent nation get off threatening “us” with a threat that they have never acknowledged, that we all know is true, and that we can neutralize by producing a symmetric counter-threat?History shows that nuclear parity is the soundest guarantee that these terrible weapons will not be used.*So why doesn’t Israel just flat out declare that they have nuclear weapons? I assume it is because it would implicate the source, the USA, guilty violating the non-proliferation treaties in force at the time.*Haven’t looked into it, but when the Soviets finally exploded a nuke in 1949, I can imagine the rejoicing of the Soviet people, despite the misery of living under Stalin.

            That’s why North Korea fast-tracked their bomb, and guess what, they’re still in charge of their country and nobody is dropping bombs on Pyongyang. I don’t know why Iran didn’t go down that route. It seems like they thought long-term, reason and moderation would win the day. They signed the JCPOA in good faith. They didn’t seem to understand the revolutionary spirit they are dealing with.

                The Iranian leadership, like the heads of most (real) countries, is still living in the world of diplomacy, and the idea of seeking deals that have at least some mutual benefit to everyone involved. They’re used to dealing with people who can, most of the time, be assumed to be acting in good faith if not good intentions.Instead the current leadership in the West is a bunch of teenagers who think they’re the Good Guys in a capeshit movie. Everything they do and say is just filler to move the plot along to the Big Ending. The plot, of course, is just one of the many branches of the Arc of History which, as we know, moves inexorably towards “justice”. The warmongering makes sense because the Big Ending always has lots of ‘splosions and CGI effects of the Bad Guys’ faces melting like the Nazis’ in Raiders of the Lost Ark.In a way, living in this environment is like living in the Hood. It might be nice if you could call a meeting of all the leading gangsters like the old Italian and Jewish mobs did. The players this time are all too stupid for that so you just need to have the most and biggest guns possible and wave them around frequently. In other words, every two-bit country now needs a nuke.I’d even say there’s another parallel. Black gangsters have been observed to often be oddly “feminine”, prone to emotional instability and irrational behavior that doesn’t even advance their goals. This is, of course, typical female behavior too. It’s no surprise that Western Europe especially, is run by girlbosses and we just narrowly avoided ending up with a particularly stupid one running the US too.

            Bingo. All of the “answers” presented are based on the “obvious” presumption that Iran getting nuclear weapons=bad. No one asks, “why?” The reality is this, mutually assured destruction works. Pakistan is filled with Islamic extremists, they haven’t nuked India yet in some country wide suicide bombing. Ditto for North Korea. Are we to assume Iran will just nuke Israel and end its own country’s existence in the name of Islamic solidarity or anti-semitism? That’s what we’re assuming?
No, Iran getting nukes is “bad” because you can’t Willy nilly do decapitation strikes and bully them around anymore, as seen in Pyongyang.

                Pakistan to my knowledge never threatening The Chosen probably has something to do with them joining the club, plus it benefits China to have a counter-balanced nuke power with India. What I always found laughable was this constant fake tension of Iran feverishly working on nukes for 40 years but never able to quite get there. Any half-rate team could put one together in a garage but we’re supposed to believe a country with the resources and human capital of the former Persian Empire just couldn’t get the math right? Maybe they have a bunch of African women working in the math department.And in another of life’s strange coincidences, it just so happens the Iran is seconds away from getting the bomb, so of course Israel has to strike. What fortuitous timing that it just so happens that 40 years of Iran moving towards nukes culminated at the same time that Gaza needed to be ethnically cleansed and Syria needed to be overthrown. Just a happy little accident I’m sure.But yes, these people always define the premise before the argument even begins. We always begin the discussion with “we all know blank” with blank being whatever benefits them.

Well they might bomb New York!

Hard to get fired up to go to war with someone who hates most of the same things I do.  I mean, yeah, they’re not a friend, but neither are the people who hate them.

                    Allright, my apologies to Temponick, you guys are kind of winning me over. The Iranian Bomb would tie up the Sneak Thieves, perhaps they’d refocus their enmity on their cousins instead of us.Egypt, for instance, doesn’t want the Palestinians because Israel would use that as an excuse to nuke the Aswan Dam. MAD would settle down South Asia but then we’d have a different proliferation – consanguinous inbreeders returning to their African rate of fertility but without the mortality limits, more “climate refugees” to flood our European homelands.Eff it, let ’em all get the bomb – they won’t be able to keep it in their pants very long.  Do we want a Muslim Europe or do we want anuclear-armedMuslim Europe?

            Now Princess Noor Pahlavi is joining in, so it’s full court press.And, not personal, one is bug-fuck ignorant if one thinks having a Shah “shoved down their throat” is worse than the pedophile Mullah Mafia. We MUST break away from the Semitic trap of “Judeochristianity, Judaism, or Islam”.To base one’s moral opinion on what an enemy has told us is pure Gell-Mann short-term amnesia. Yes, a puppet – that’s the reality of power and support- but not fully the MEK or several other Israeli-backed “dissident” groups. And if the Bully in the region is behind it, then it has punch.Remember, Islam is far worse immediately, and it is the spearhead of Judaism. It’s the thug busting through the front door when they can’t sneak through the back door.Laws and EOs against “antisemitism” means you go to jail for opposing any Semite- as we see with the manufactured consent ginned up for the Left and their “Palestinian protests”.

        Obama epitomized the triumph of clever over smart. He also is a good representative of the short shelf life of a currently prized performer–once the act grows stale, people tune out. I doubt Obama could fill a stadium at a HBCU at this point.This is the cause of the collective Gell-Mann amnesia.It is truly alarming. Americans already had the attention span of a gnat. That would be an insult to a gnat now. I think social media probably played a larger role, but, yes, the transition to performance over substance played a huge role in the disappearance of memory.As for Iran, whether it happens there or not, a truly crushing and humiliating military defeat might–might–focus the minds of Americans. I still think it will take economic deprivation and that generously assumes they would recall it did not always exist.

            Obama’s commitment to using South Side Chicago locals as workers at his Presidential library has long delayed the project.  The gigantic eyesore is now expected to open next year.  The biggest surprise is that no one seems to care about any of it.  Michelle got a small amount of attention for some complaining about him a couple of months ago, but otherwise he is fading away.

            True but so far, Obama’s foreign policy seems more rational than Trump’s. He wasn’t as tied into the Zionist thing as Trump (or Biden). The major black mark against him was allowing HRC to talk him into the Libya debacle.

                I’d say it was him orchestrating the Arab Spring, a test by our Intelligence Community of social media’s capabilities.
They George Floyd’d the region, starting with one fruitseller (in Tunis?) setting himself on fire, leading to Muslim Brotherhood briefly taking over Egypt, and a cascade of other effects – the worst of which was the intentional flood of war refugees into Merkel’s Germany and the EU.

Steve Bannon is on Tucker trying to convince Tucker publically to join this chaos generator. I would advice Tucker to stay away.

                Tucker referenced Louis “Jolly” West, the CIA psychologist who seemed to visit every assassin and terrorist from Jack Ruby to McVeigh, and had ties to Manson and Jim Jones as well, in his interview with Bannon. Bannon then went on to discuss JJ Angleton’s role in JFK’s assassination in a conversation that Angleton had with Sen. Gary Hart in which Angleton referenced an Old Testament quote, sending Hart back to Mike Mansfield in the Senate to tell him to “shut it down.”

                            That’s correct, the U.S. coup occurred in 1963.  I’ve written about this at length over the past two decades.
Who was deposed?  Christian, traditional America and its Catholic king.
Who seized (overt) power?  Masonic, neo-gnostic elements already embedded in intel.
It is no coincidence that the Civil Rights and Immigration acts immediately followed.  America post-’63 bears no resemblance to its predecessor.

                I watched a little of that interview and was irked to hear both Tucker and Bannon blame “the Deep State” for beating the war drums on Iran.  Obviously, Permanent Washington is a yuge problem and needs to be gutted. But the Intel Community — Deep Staters, obviously — just put out an assessment saying that Irandoesn’thave a nuke program. A bizarre way to cheerlead another war.
I came away thinking that talking about The Deep State is a way toavoid mentioningthe Israel Lobby.
Maybe the interview got better after I bailed.

        Bill Clinton might have been larping as a serious statesman, but Dubya was larping as a rootin’ tootin’ cowboy who swaggers into the saloon for a beer after he won the duel. This guy was a friggin secret society member at Yale and took an oath to Lord-knows-what and surrounded himself with lunatic neocons but all we heard was about how good he looked in a flight suit and how much better he is to have a beer with than the losers he was up against (he didn’t even drink). This doesn’t even compare to the next guy, who was entirely a creation of the media, secret societies, communist agitators, and likely the intelligence community. It’s like they crafted the guy they felt like the public needed at each point in time, and just ran out of juice in 2016 when Americans shockingly chose the guy who was a loudmouth since the 1980s over the feminist queen glass ceiling breaker.

            Great comment. Right on the button.‘It’s like they crafted the guy they felt like the public needed at each point in time’That’s because they did. Obama was an entirely artificed entity, whose grooming started even before birth, as Moms was sp00ked up. They took the prima materia — a cunning, swaggering, neighborhood player — and molded him into the president they wanted at that particular time.How quickly folks forget Pharaoh’s Global Messiah Tour.  It is a mistake to assume Obie is out of the power loop now.  He is a poison mushroom that keeps breaking through the soil.As Nance Pelosi might say, it’s not a democracy, it’s Our Democracy.

                Case in point: the Obama-Holder era Intel Community Inspector General (ICIG) construct. The building remains after the masons are gone. And not for nothing did the Spider have his Kalomara mansion two miles from the Biden White House, with their fellow Khalid Rashidi protege Kamala Harris ready to step into the Presidential shoes.Remember, this guy toured golf courses near homosexual Democrat power players’ homes. He’s a master at covert cell networks, that’s how he turned ACORN from an Arkansas cell of 30 old hippies into an unseen national army of 300,000 activists, or the black AME churches into a recruitment and ballot-harvesting machine. With Presidential clearance, this agent had serious contacts, and you can never leave the Mafia, no matter how your star has faded.

            I used to say that Clinton spent his life chasing women and public office, while Bush spent his chasing a whisky bottle and public office. Each was a disaster in his own way but I think Dubya was more disastrous in retrospect.

                Dubya was more disastrous in the sense of what otherwise might have been, had “conservatives” not (yet again) been hoodwinked by someone who claimed to represent their interests. The same basic coalition that elected Trump has been there at least since Goldwater.

                        Well come on, we had that Bruce Willis movie about deporting innocent Muslim immigrants,The Siege –we’re bad people!
So there I was, sitting next to a nervous, close-mouthed Arab at a diner just outside of New York, having breakfast at 4 a.m. on 9/12 – he was taking his little daughter and getting the heck out of town.
(Somebody did tell me they were pulling anybody who looked Arab out of cabs downtown and beating the living shit out of them.)

        Can’t disagree with anything you’re saying. Trump of course is neither clever nor smart and seemingly makes one maladroit move after another. Even Joe Masseria and Sal Maranzano acted with more intelligence than Trump does. In fact I wonder how much actual agency Trump does have, if any.
One thing to mention in passing is that fifty years ago the country was more “white” and had more “Asabiyyah.” Now it’s more balkanized.

        Perception management was a term coined well before Clinton. By the mid 80s the three ring flea circus of regime media was already well in place. The bombing of Ghadafi (sp?) was a well oiled propaganda campaign. It advanced with the deposing of Noriega in Panama. Then, it reached full maturity with, “Operation Desert Storm”, being a 24×7 multi-channel sports pre-game, halftime and post-game show all rolled into one. You could argue that it began really with the Cold War and the creation of what we now call the, “Post War Consensus” or the “Boomer Truth Regime.”Its roots are deep and its toehold the psyche of the lobotomized audience and the psychopathic producers. Bernays codified the psychological hydrogen bomb that was unleashed on Western Civilization in tandem with Popper’s savaging of its foundational principles espoused by Plato.Clinton was a logical next step. He was the Boomer with an MBA whose credentials also included the cool factor of licentiousness, vice and promiscuity that an already collapsed civilization and empire erected as a cope and a lure to throw on the ankle weights and go down with the ship.Buchanan asked, “Will America survive to 2025?” Before our very eyes America and Americans are in a fight with an invading population and a degenerate petite bourgeoisie class.Apparently Gavin Newsome’s wife was shopping in LA this weekend with her personal body guard and her mansion priced hand bags, excuse me, um clutches. Apparently, on good authority from inside sources, here clique of all-in-on-TDS White women were texting about how to attend a riot with gas masks, tear gas treatements … … Of course, they probably flew off from a private air field to inspect their new mansion build sites on Maui on the way to their private Borneo bungalows.

            Yes. I would just add that Clinton is a lawyer, not MBA. This explains his excellent parsing of words and hair-splitting.I would also add that Clinton was the first president overtly marketed to women voters. The “gender gap” started with Reagan but reached its apogee with Trump. But I would argue that Clinton ushered in the era of “feminized politics” in America.

and an oil bank for that light, sweet Libyan crude opened up in a country with no government the week after Gaddafi was assassinated.
Also said was that nuclear bomb parts, blueprinted in Pakistan and machined in Malaysia, were stored with uranium refined to an unknown degree in a cavern system.

        This is a recurring phenomenon with our elites- never having to pay for their mistakes. If they just narrative hard enough, reality doesn’t matter. We’ve seen this time and time again. Ukraine and Syria being the latest examples where we thought we could just write slick propaganda and rule the day, only to have it blow up in our faces. No worries though, spin up a fake victory report and move on to the next one.This Israel crap is following this pattern. Loads of “This is the greatest military victory in the history of mankind” reports, yucking it up by the usual suspects and their normie useful idiots, followed by actual terrible third order effects brought on by this meddling, followed like night after day by a complete memory-holing of the entire affair.

                Now that he’s posted that “we” control the skies over Iran, there is no longer any pretense. If there ever was. I expect US forces will be openly involved in a matter of hours. If they aren’t already.

        And, (((who))), exactly are the people known for being clever but not smart? Who has controlled out media for the past century? Who have been the biggest stand-up comics? The pornographers? The shyster lawyers? The financial swindlers? The people like Boesky and Milken and Madoff who prize immediate profit at the expense of long-term financial stability?Well, it’s the same people controlling our foreign policy. The same people who bit off more than they could chew when they committed an unprovoked attack on Iran, and now want Uncle Sugar to bail their asses out.You can and should blame the stupid goyim for allowing themselves to be bamboozled, but the Tribe of professional bamboozlers have been at it for 4,000 years and are, unfortunately, pretty damn good at it.

        Clever over smart succeeds only so long as one controls the reserve currency money printer (or as long as one is a vassal state of he who does). You’ll note that Russia and China are not part of the clever over smart brigade, the opposite usually. Russia especially. I believe that clever over smart is a product of owning the money printer, that it never would have come about otherwise. The geographic invulnerability of AINO, combined with the money printer, gave rise to a class of “leaders” who didn’t have to worry about consequences, only about power.

        I’ve always said that Bill Clinton was the beginning of the end for this country. I knew some people back in the 90’s who thought he was the anti-Christ. Hillary was probably co-President and she started promoting the woke stuff but after the 1994 mid-term Democrat disaster, was told to tone it down. After that Bill Clinton basically became a prostitute and did whatever would make him popular. I honestly believe he was initially a throw away candidate, but someone convinced Ross Perot to run and take away votes from Bush.

            It’s impossible to determine whether Perot cost Bush the election. Montana and Nevada, which went to Clinton because of Perot’s high vote total, would not have been sufficient in terms of Electoral College votes had they remained Republican to give Bush the win.https://www.aei.org/articles/dont-know-whether-perot-cost-bush/

                I lived in California during this election and every Republican I knew there voted for Perot. He actually won a few counties in California. Remember, California was Republican back then. I believe Perot came in second behind Clinton in Colorado. Many states were won by a small amount of votes. The media went in to damage control after the election, claiming Perot took more votes from Clinton, which I think is complete BS. BTW, Perot was massive pro-Israel.

            The Clintons’ big “achievement” was completing the  transition of the Dems from the working class party to the party of the oligarchs. The outsourcing of the industrial economy was crippling the Dem’s old labor union allies and enriching the oligarchs. What to do? Ditch the working class and embrace the oligarchs! Clinton was a member of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of wealthy Dems and their political stooges whose mission was to make the Democratic Party oligarch-friendly under the guise of “moderation.” They had some resistance inside the party (Jesse Jackson used to refer to them as the “Democratic Leisure Class Council” but their money carried the day. Now you have various “populist” Dems being financed by the oligarchs they claim to oppose.

        Media manipulation has been around ever since media. FDR managed to hide his paralysis from the public thanks to media cooperation. He also had his critics in the press purged and sent down the memory hole. Previously famous journalists and writers became unpeople. JFK had a similarly compliant press, which helped that shameless playboy sell himself to the public as a devoted family man.

            The JFK media op was so successful, a large slice of present-day internet dissidence is premised on it. Our guys who think he was killed by Israel and/or the CIA are the last true believers in Camelot™, blind to who he was,whosehe was, what he did, and what he planned to do.One of a thousand examples: He tried to sabotage NASA because he was offended by the look of it, by itspersonnel, Southern Midwestern non-Catholic non-Jewish men from outside the Ivy League. “He said the moon thing!” Yeah, on TV. In real life he initiated a purge of every brave and competent man in the agency. Tom Wolfe wrote about the resistance to it. We went to the moon because Kennedy died too soon to stop us.One example.

                That is certainly a dissident take. What about the “JFK and Kruschev in secret talks to end the Cold War” claim? Some feel that’s another reason he got shot.That tempts me to tell a story I’ve never told.A story about two Irish sailors who served in the Pacific, Mac and Fitz.Well, Fitz was very famous, and couldn’t let his hair down much.So when he met Mac, he found a jolly fellow of like mind who didn’t ask questions and enjoyed joshing about poontang. Fitz insisted Mac be waiting for him at the airport whenever Fitz flew in.Something bad happened to Fitz. Something very bad. And bad things had already started to happen to all the little people around him- afterwards, things got very bad for some of them indeed.

        There is no question America slid into unseriousness during the Clinton years.  The end of the Cold War allowed a creep like Clinton, and a crook like Hillary to debauch the White House for eight years.
Recall, too, the rest of the political class lost all seriousness:  Arlen Specter:  “Judge Thomas, have you ever heard of Long Dong Silver?”.
Not a serious country since the 1990s.

        Media gaslighting intensifies asNewsweekjust posted an article that describes how many casualties the US could inflict by nuking Iranian cities. The article tone is a barely restrained sense of glee.
Also, keep an eye on theNimitz, which should enter the region in 4 to 5 days. That seems like a ripe target that would immediately pull the US into war.

        we are in an age of the clever man not the smart man as the face of the blob. The blob needs these clever players to sell agendas that go against the interests and basic desires of the American people.This truly came of age under Clinton both because of the 24/7 news cycle and by that time Jews had cemented power but it has been building up for a long time.Go back to William Randolf Hearst’s boast that he could supply the war. The FDR administration was filled with clever men who were smart about their goals which went against the goals of the American people to stay out of war.Same thing with the Johnson Administration that was very clever about starting the Vietnam War on a major scale. By that time they didn’t even need to have a real Pearl Harbor they could go back to the time of Hearst and just manufacture the Gulf of Tonkin.Things just keep getting worse.

        I have a hunch and I’m wondering if you have a theory or agree with this –politics have been changed in the united states in a way that can’t just be explained by demographics. For instance Kamala Harris won 41% of the white vote and just forty years ago, Walter Mondale won 34% of the white vote.Walter Mondale was a dopey liberal yes, but he seemed like a perfectly nice guy. You can’t convince me that if the Kamala Harris of 2024 time traveled to 1984 that she would get 34% of the white vote. I feel she would get a decent amount less.

        You cannot beat cleaver by being more cleaver than all the other cleaver guys and gals. The core problem is that “cleaver” persists because the political environment rewards it. Nothing will change until the environment disincentivizes cleaver to the point of extinction and replaces it with smart as the successful alternative paradigm. So how do we change the environment to accomplish this goal. Well, it’s not by promoting a cleaver mass movement or new mass psychosis. It’s one pathogen at a time.

        The clever have gotten to the point where they think the smart really fell for their cleverness and weren’t just going along to make the best of it, to get along, or to clean up their mess.You see this in the personal too, the pathological liar who thinks she has everyone in the family and extended family fooled, when they all know she is pathological, but they just go along to keep peace in the family amap. Sooner or later though if the SHTF and there is a crisis in the family they could experience some shocking, only to them mostly, pushback. And the rest of the family will be glad for it, whether they say so or not.

            Trump is apparently about to stake his presidency on regime change in Iran. If he is able to achieve that without too much external chaos (no one cares about chaos inside Iran, but they should), then he can  probably spin it into a victory.But if it gets messy, he’s probably done. The parade was fake and gay. His family’s money-grubbing is embarrassing. He seems to be even more thin skinned than usual. The economy remains precarious. The MAGA coalition is fracturing. If Trump isn’t careful, all he will be left with is Boomer Evangelicals.Tomorrow doesn’t belong to the Fox News demo.

                I would argue he is done. The same people telling you that all the US needs to do is hand off a bunch of bunker busters are the ones who told you that Iraq would be a clean six month operation. They’re wrong and they’re lying. So expect lots of chaos. Reminder that we are only getting the Israel side of things right now in the media, they’re locking down media coverage of the damage Iran is doing.But it’s worse than that. It is the whole kayfabe thing. As of now based on the things Trump has said, it seems like the negotiations were in bad faith and they were working with Israel to lull Iran into a false sense of security. This is totally reprehensible. Trump is out there shooting his mouth about what a dishonest broker the USA is. Whether it is true or whether he is saying that just because he got embarrassed and wants to reassert control is irrelevant. Netanyahu is happy to go along with this because he knows how bad it looks for Trump.

                    “So expect lots of chaos.”
That’s exactly why I voted for Trump for the 3rd time, and the consequent systemic delegitimization. I think things are going GREAT!
Once one crosses the line in understanding that there is no reformation, or even mere survival of Europeanity, within the present system, one understands that “collapse is the cure.” We may not survive it, but if we don’t have a collapse, we aren’t going to survive anyway. I don’t give a damn if middle-aged merchants lose their IRA’s. I give a damn whether there is a future for white children.

                Given the amount of military hardware now in the region, it seems impossible for us to deny what’s about to happen. What is strange is Trump’s departure for a 5 a.m. National Security Council meeting — the story we are being fed — from Canada last night and his “evacuate Tehran” warning. Was military action imminent and Trump flew back to delay it? Likely not, and we may never know, but I’d love to know the backstory on this.

                Why on earth has he decided to flush his legacy down the toilet with this harebrained scheme? He has spoken about the folly of middle east wars for years.I don’t believe he is in the Epstein tapes because that would have been revealed years ago when Democrats were in full control of the FBI and government.The only thing that makes sense is that the office of the President is just window dressing and they do not control “national security” issues.

                    I don’t think he’s in the tapes either.
I think what’s going on here is two things.
One, after doing business in NYC his entire life he, thinks that part of the cost of doing business is making sure the Jews are happy.
Two, he shares the 1970-1980s white, blue-collar, enlisted-man prejudices against the “ragheads” — “kill ’em all and let Allah sort ’em out.” He remembers 1979.
I think Bibi and the Israel lobby are playing both these cards to manipulate him.

                        Of course they are manipulating him. In the past 24 hours or so, he has certainly seemed to enjoy swaggering around like a tough guy. Remember how DC works, he has full bipartisan support for this, it’s probably the most people have liked him in a decade, and he’s eating it up. He’s yelling at his supporters like Tucker who said this is not America First.
This is bad.

                Regime change in Iran is the last domino to fall, a typical destabilization operation. It would stymie Russia’s access to the Global South and starve China of 20% of her oil, so I’m pretty sure that’s the plan.

        Agreeing with Tarl Cabot and others that regime change is in the works.
If it returns the Pahlavis, Europe would end up more integrated with the Mideast and the nascent Mediterranean Union (North Africa-Levant), but the result would be more like Andalusian Cordoba (universities) and less like Mughal India (pyramids of skulls).
I’m predicting the Semites will win, sadly, since that’s what they intend to do there (reverse the Crusades, Lepanto, Vienna, and Spain) and here (Palantir theocracy, Lutnick economy). Trying to reconcile myself with this.

            If the plan is regime change, then the “clever” people are exceeding stupid.  The first Pahlavi was installed by regime change.  How has that worked out?  The US tried regime change in South Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Haiti…  How did has that work out?  What ever happened to the fellows the US picked for Iraq (Chalabi) and Afghanistan (Karzai)?
Now, being the USA’s  hand-picked stooge to isn’t a completely bad deal.  It probably remunerates pretty good, as long as you don’t have to stay in the country you were picked to rule…

                Well, they are consistent, I’ll give you that.I see as the Powers trying to reverse their mistake; they wanted to destabilize a competitor, but got an Islamist Lenin in his place.
The faggot tyrant Mossadegh was a Soviet stooge, confiscating everybody’s assets and banning opposition a la Zelensky.Pat Kennedy fumbled that and spun it.
The Shah himself was regime changed by CIA, but under the direction of that bumbling Communist, Carter (the same dip who gave away the Canal and brokered North Korea’s nuclear.)

                Vietnam was one thing, Haiti another thing, and the Zionists destabilizing and weakening all their neighbors is a 3rd thing. The latter seems to be going fairly well, I have to admit.

        What’s this latest Trump tweet?  “Unconditional surrender”?  “We know where the Supreme Leader is hiding, but we’re not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now”?!!
Temponick, was that the Unconditional Surrender tweet?
Whiskey said Iran tried closing the Strait in ’88, but we smoked ’em out of it.Then again, that was 1988.

        What happens when politics reveals itself for it always has been. This is what we get. At least in the past the actors pretended to be thoughtful and utilizing 2nd order thinking.
Like corporate hierarchies that may initially have a CEO who appears to be competent. eventually the truth is revealed and the CEO is recast in a truer form, the ugliness so unbearable the system eventually collapses.
Remember folks, Nature always wins. And Nature does not entertain parasites and superparasites, only the Meek.

                Jannie meant well, so I didn’t want to point out that Bosnia-Serbia was a direct line to everything that followed…that is, to today.
Thing is, we can’t lay this one directly at the feet of Jews, or Blacks, or Muslims, or Chinese, or Indians (although Jews and Chinese were directly involved) – this one we lay right at the feet of the all White coupling of a midwestern city gal and a good ol’ country redneck.
White people.  We are so fkg gullible and shortsighted.

                    There was a lot of handwringing over the inter-ethinic bloodshed in the Balkans, but nobody was willing to step in. There have been no major issued in the region since Clinton/Holbrooke intervened, apart from a brief flare-up in Kosovo in 1999. The peace has thus far held, like Northern Ireland.

                        That’s true! It has held, and other divorces followed without bloodshed. Usually we just tear stuff up without trying to mend it.

                There was no “Yugoslavia” by that point (in name only – it had de facto broken apart). You need to read up on Holbrooke.

                    Can’t quite agree, we were heavily involved, the main perpetrators in my thinking- but I don’t know anything about Holbrooke, so thanks.
