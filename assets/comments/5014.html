        “Barbarianism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. It is the whim of circumstance. And barbarianism must ultimately triumph”― Robert E. Howard
The BBC should consider for a moment, Barbarians don’t tender subsidies.

        Al-Beeb will always pander to the lowest whenever it can, because such organisations like theirs are driven not by the desire to improve (it was the remit of the original BBC to raise the level of culture in the UK by educating as well as informing and entertaining) but out of fear.Of course, western society (and British society is very much part of that) is guided by fear because of all the lunatics out there. Lunatics who can do real damage. For example, a muslim lunatic tries to kill someone not of his faith but he is never described as muslim in case it inflames other muslims to take action. They are all simply ‘asians’ as if Sikhs from India or retired Ghurka troops are equally likely to commit such acts. Even the use of the word ‘islamist’ is just to avoid saying the dreaded M word.There is also the fact that the lunatics always shout the loudest and demand the most. It makes them seem more scary than they are and they love it when people cave in to their screeches and whines.A golf commentator says something that probably raised a sort of smile in most households and by no stretch of the imagination is it offensive. At worst it isn’t particularly funny but most people watching the Open golf are interested in the sport and not the commentator; like shots of the sea in the distance it is mostly background. However one person sounds off and, gasp, even has a hashtag! OMG, burble the BBC, something must be done!Now if Alliss (who I would rather talk to than, say, Ms Wade) had said that Johnson’s wife thought as the last putt went in, ‘Oh good, now I can open an all-faith multi-cultural transgender-appreciation centre with special access for the terminally socialist’ then there would have been nothing but praise and Al-Beeb could heave sigh of relief.
