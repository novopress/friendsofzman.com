        It isn’t just that we are sick to death of it. It is that our very survival is threatened.“2/ White guilt was never a natural sentiment; no people naturally hate themselves or push for their own demographic extinction. It did not emerge organically from conscience or history. It was manufactured, ritualized, and weaponized. It was imposed from above by alien elites who seized control of the institutions of education, media, and culture, and rewrote morality to make one group, the White population, the permanent villain in its own homeland.From the youngest age, White children are taught to associate their identity with conquest, slavery, cruelty, and destruction. They are told to dissociate from their own heritage, to feel shame for the achievements of their ancestors, to distrust their instincts, and to question the legitimacy of their very existence. They are instructed to love all others, but never themselves.This is not ethics. It is psychological warfare.And like all systems built on repression, it only works if it remains unquestioned. The moment it is challenged, seriously, openly, defiantly, it begins to fall apart. The power of White guilt lies in silence, not argument. Once someone says aloud, “I do not feel guilty,” the illusion weakens for everyone else.That is what the Hendrix fundraiser represents. Not a defense of one person, but a refusal to obey the narrative. It is one thing to quietly disagree with the orthodoxy. It is another to act on that disagreement. The act of giving money in defiance of the media’s command is a political gesture far more radical than voting. It is an act of moral rejection. And tens of thousands just performed it.” – Chad CrowleyMore here:https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1918324426463997964.html

            Exactly. It really is an emperor has no clothes kind of thing. The minute whites know that they can push back without losing their job or just generally getting destroyed, the whole thing falls apart. I’ve said for years that all we need to do to stop all of this shi$ is offer a job to the guy fired for pushing back.
That time has come.

                it’s incredible how much of this racial spoils system runs on the honor system. The entire affirmative action regime for colleges and jobs relies on White people checking the “White” box and as such telling the colleges and companies they are second-class citizens that need not be considered for these slots. All White people have to do is lie. It’s literally illegal for colleges and companies to ask about it and they definitely cannot force people to verify it. if every White person lied on their application then the entire system falls apart.

                    I’ve started just clicking on “black” or “Hispanic” for the race question in my current endless, frustrating job search. Unfortunately, they probably use some AI or at least algorithms (not the same thing) to determine if your claimed race is likely to be correct. What I’d like to do is submit my exact same resume with an over the top ghetto or beaner name. Unfortunately, if it works and they call me in for an interview, I’m going to have some trouble continuing the act or answering to J’Aquarius Bigdickkus with a straight face. At this point, I’m not above pulling a “Tropic Thunder” and going full Robert Downey Jr. though. But you know, don’t ever go full RDJ as they say.

                        Maybe, but there are also lots of people with this sort of heritage and totally European names, especially if their dad was a diversity enjoyer. I also suspect that companies are secretly quite fine with hiring a competent White person who lied when they checked the box, although they’ll never, ever say so.

            That is a terrific encapsulation. And the part about sustained psychological warfare against whites especially rings true. Hence, I am in the process of watching all 480 episodes of Gunsmoke in chronological order. Now for the most part, this is a marvelous show and there is little objectionable about it. Indeed, much of it is praiseworthy. There is one glaring exception, however. In every single episode I’ve seen to this point (I’m in the fifth season), whenever Indians are involved, they are depicted either as saintly victims of white cruelty or as heroic allies of Matt Dillon and his friends. It is set in stone. The moment an Indian appears on screen, you know exactly where it’s all going.So, the psychological warfare against whites didn’t begin with All in the Family or Roots or Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. It was already present at least as early as the mid-50s in onstensibly rightwing cultural genres such as the Western. The process of rewiring white consciousness will be truly massive.

                Good catch. One particularly egregious episode involves an Indian woman being sexually harassed by two whites with the implication she will be raped. I don’t know the date of that one but it predates Lear by at least a decade. The seeds of anti-white propaganda were planted long ago.

                    Recently saw an episode where the victim of white rapiness was a Messkin. Her father, played by Simon Oakland, wound up killing one of the malefactors. That is the only episode I’ve seen so far in which Messkins appeared.

                I’m a fan of film-noir mainly from late 40’s – late 50’s.  Mostly white people, yet  whenever a person of color does make it on screen – it’s same thing as you noted for Gunsmoke.

                    Possibly. Although seemingly, if psychological warfare works–and it clearly does–reverse psychological warfare should produce a salubrious counter-effect.

                Sports fan, your criticism against Gunsmoke makes it appear to be a “marvelous” Trojan horse fit for a citizenry of undiscerning retards (most straight “white” males) and their misled females. It’s also a retired teammate of your precious spectator sports, of which all professional manifestations need to be hauled away to the landfill of history with the talmudes, the gospel of queering, the Constitution, and the declaration of “Separation”.

John Dunning wrote that, among radio drama enthusiasts, “Gunsmoke is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time.”It ran unsponsored for its first few years, with CBS funding its production. In 1955, the series was adapted for television and ran for 20 seasons. It ran for half-hour episodes from 1955 to 1961, and one-hour episodes from 1961 to 1975. A total of 635 episodes were aired over its 20 year run, making it the longest-running scripted American primetime television series…:Famous Players–Lasky1912: Famous Players Film Company1916: Famous Players–Laskyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_Players%E2%80%93LaskyCBShttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBSRadio: September 18, 1927Television: July 1, 1941(((Adolph Zukor)))https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Zukor(((Jesse L.

                    Westinghouse [a forerunner of “CBS”] was founded in 1886, andEdison’s first movie was in 1894 [“Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze”].If you look at the players involved in the making of what came to be known as, “CBS”, (((they))) had already infiltrated the industry by 1912, with the “Famous Players Film Company“.It’s obvious that the Council of the Sanhedrin very quickly realized that (((they))) would need to throw all of their resources into seizing control of the nascent media [Marconi’s Radio, and, subsequently, Philo Farnsworth’s Television].I have long held that (((David Sarnoff)))’s destruction of Philo Farnsworth was the signature event of the 20th Century; arguably vastly more important than even Griswold &amp; Roe-v-Wade.[My suspicion being that we never would have had Griswold &amp; Roe if Farnsworth had prevailed.]

                There was once a sophisticated nobility, aristocracy, that was balanced across castes that would enable an embedding but that at some point put a stop to the perfidy and the abuse.But the noble/aristocratic warriors, clerics, and landed nobility whose duties and position demanded some ability to counter-balance roles and interests were destroyed. What remained was everyone being a merchant with no fidelity to principle or stake in the future and ascendency being solely reliant and accumulating treasure with no need for fides as a measure of quality. It is a quantitative world view which is the world view of a merchant and that bends toward the evil of accumulation even if by extraction.Yes. I agree. The people who made those films and who made those judgements and who wrote those speeches and who provided the legal defense and who cultivated academic disciplines that formalized the advocacy and open promotion of our genocide and who funded and administered the Universities as that happened but who police them against other forms of ethnic hostility … … and who oversaw the opening of the borders and the provision of settler colonization apps and funding for the hotels and church coffers … … … all have names.They aren’t Biden. He licked ice cream cones and took his share of the cut, but he didn’t decide or orchestrate anything. Just like Hendrix saying the word and flipping the bird, the day is coming where names will be named.

Then why do their fingerprints rarely end up at the scene of the crime? Why is it almost always Lutheran Social Services or Catholic Charities or World Council of Churches doing the dirty? Why are organizations like Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and Jewish Immigrant Aid Services bit players?

                    “Then why do their fingerprints rarely end up at the scene of the crime?”When you have millennia of mendacious parasitism engrained in your genetics, you figure out ways to surreptitiously enact your agenda.Do you know who Catholic Charities or Lutheran Social Services ultimately benefit?  I do, I see it everyday and it’s certainly not benefiting Catholics or Lutherans.  It’s the landlords and real estate companies housing the invaders that are the ultimate beneficiaries of these organizations.  Always laughable when some jew-apologist tries to use this ridiculous line to cover for their masters.These are 501(c)(3) charitable organizations.  So our enemies make tax deductible donations to these resettlement organizations.  Then their donations end up getting redistributed to their friends in the real estate industry.  Finally, as an added bonus, they are able to flood the country with diversity.  This is how it works in it’s simplest form.  What a grift!

One of the signature ephiphanies of muh entire life was when I realized that we don’t build Levittowns in the USA as a means by which to house our fellow citizens; that, instead, we buildLevittowns in the USA as a means by which to lower the grindstone of debt slavery about the necks of the poor stupid idiot Wagies who sign up for the usurious mortgages on the Levittown houses.

            This is not just an American problem, it is a problem across all Western (white) nations. Canada, Australia, England, Sweden, Germany, the U.S. — ALL of them have official ideologies encouraging white women to become corporate drones and have abortions and use birth control rather than reproduce. All of them have a pro-homosexual ideology. ALL of them adhere to the ideology of importing nonwhite immigrants and suppressing the will of the native-born whites.How many average Germans want Turks and Syrians in their midst? How many Canadians and Englishmen want to be swamped by Subcontinentals and Pakis? Yet it is happening whether they want it or not. There is not a single white politician or party anywhere in the West who is not subject to arrest if he or she actually stands up for the white race (Marine LePen, Golden Dawn, AfD, Donald Trump, etc.) There is not a single city in the West that is not flooded with nonwhites and immigrants — Paris, London, Toronto, etc.Race communism is the official ideology of the ruling elite of the West. It is not the Soviet communism that we allied ourselves with against against the nationalists of the 1940s but it is communism nonetheless. The class struggle is the elite bourgeois “vanguard” allied with the nonwhite lumpenptoletariat against the actual Trump-voting proletariat and petty bourgeoisie.I don’t know what to do about it but the first step is to recognize the problem and admit that the West is not “free” in any real sense. It is a Huxleyan sexual/egalitarian communist society rather than an industrial proletarian communist society but let us  make no mistake about it, it IS communist.

            On one hand, the blacks are mad that they don’t have self-determination because the districts are drawn so the blacks can’t vote “for the candidate of their choice,” which is always a Blob-supporting, corrupt scumbag who gets reliably reelected as long as the black preachers get their cut. These successful lawsuits in Alabama and Louisiana, financed by the usual suspects, are solely to add more zombie blacks to the House.The blacks get mad at “White Flight” because they lack the cognitive capacity and morality to run a First World civilization and drive the whites (I believe on purpose) away due to their noise and criminality.Then when the city is a vacant ruin with vast swathes of empty lots, they call the whites moving back and resettling an area “gentrification” because the property values (and ad valorem taxes) increase. Funny how they whine about this but never mention the negative effect that a black majority in a neighborhood does to property values. (Gee, I wonder why?)

We need a House and Senate for us without spiteful mutant “squads”. Electoral votes based on white citizens. None of this Illegal/Mutant census.

            Another reason they exist is because government and the legal system switched sides during the so-called “civil rights movement.” Prior to this development, whites were allowed to discriminate against blacks based upon race, and the police would back them up if they used force to repel the negroes. With the advent of the CRM, that very force was used to impose the Africans upon whites. The only thing whites could do at that point was move to the incipient burbs.

                    Exactly this.  Even without the “others”, the chief characteristics of dense cities are stench, overcrowding, overtaxation, slums, pollution, and relentless noise.  I have no ill will toward urbanites per se.  For many of them the economy forces their hand.  But even if all non-whites decamped for Wakanda and greater pissreal, I would not move to the urban wastes.

                    Now that we are out of those suburbs (and ours was considered a prosperous one), we cannot fathom ever again living ‘piled one on another’ or in that ‘little private space’ (we lived on the end of a cul-de-sac but still felt under siege).  Looking out the window and seeing no houses, nothing but trees, hills, and skies, is something we will never take for granted and consider a blessing from God.

        “Like the Somalis in Minnesota, the public was never asked about any of this.”Many years ago I came across reference to surveys done in the early 1960’s, preparatory to the 1965 Hart-Cellar Treason Act which opened the floodgates to the nons, which asked those Americans surveyed whether they were ok with becoming a colors of Benetton society. The maggot people were testing the waters. Our ancestors responded “No! NO! &amp; HELL NO!” but it happened anyway.Reading about that was the moment I realized that all of this “sacred democracy is the will of the people” nonsense was all lies. It was only later that I came across the American poet Ezra Pound’s 1930’s assessment “Democracy is just rule by jews.”The destruction of America and other European societies is a top-down process. The enemy seized possession of the control nodes of the societies they infest, and used them to stampede the white human cattle towards destruction. We are like the Russians in the early Soviet Union: rule (as opposed to mere administration) exercised over us mostly by foreigners with a sprinkling of domestic collaborators.Without an indigenous RULING class of our own to organize our collective self-defense, we are like a fat antelope being set upon by various competing packs of hyenas, wolves, and jackals. Leadership cadres at the municipal and state level are the best way forward, because the imperial (federal) level is hopelessly corrupt.Oh, and ALL Somalis have to go back. Pitiless remigration is not an answer. Pitiless remigration is THE answer.

                        I forget what it is called, but they are batshit crazy enough (maybe it’s not every sect) to have some belief where they have a string that they hang from telephone and power poles (or whatever is handy) with which they enclose a large area within which they dwell. Ostensibly the string, AS LONG AS IT IS CONNECTED, acts to prevent God from seeing them being naughty on the Sabbath.I remember reading a story that it came down in NYC b/c of some construction or something at an inopportune time and the municipal authorities were given heavy pressure to fix everything pronto so that they could get the string reconnected. That string isn’t hiding from God whatever you are doing in those tunnels, Chabadniks.These nutters have been deciding our immigration, trade, and defense (war) policies for at least 2 generations. I hope God damns Mike Pence, One-Eyed McCain and every other traitor who has been their willing slave to Hellfire for an eternity.

            We are like the Russians in the early Soviet Union: rule (as opposed to mere administration) exercised over us mostly by foreigners with a sprinkling of domestic collaborators.
Let’s hope we’re like Russians living in the late years of the Romanovs, who were viewed as equally foreign by the domestic population, and most of whom found the Russian language repulsive, speaking French almost exclusively. At least we’d have an opportunity up ahead of us to remove these people from their thrones.
Otherwise, we have about 85 years of this ahead of us.

                        All the royal houses of Europe are descendants of William the Conqueror, who was himself an infant orphan.
(Consanguinty, close cousin marriage, worked as well for the ruling class in Europe as it did in Egypt, the Levant, and Arabia. The defectives are more likely to die, but the dominant traits are reinforced in those who live. Thus, “born to rule.”
Of course one outmarries at first through arranged royal marriages, but soon enough, the numerous grandkids of prima noctis start boffing each other as kissing cousins.)

The wikipedia page makes it look as though they were somewhere in the general vicinity of Erfurt.

                    One might add as well, that almost to the time of the Revolution, the masses working the land, i.e., the surfs, were in essence slaves tied to the land. Freeholding had long been established in the West, not so much Russia. Slaves tend to revolt as the Romanov’s would soon learn.

                Nineteen downthumbs in about 4 hours. Not bad for this crowd of dissident bootlickers.
It’s btw that Trump is now talking about paying criminal aliens $1,000 to leave. The DHS has stated that travel assistance, too, is available.
The results will be mediocre, so someone in the admin will demand that the jackpot be in increased. (People respond to incentives!) What’s the limit given the financial constraints on the president? $2,000? $5,000? $10k, plus a round trip ticket which the remigrants will promise not to use to return to the USA?

                        All Ride-By does is amuse himself through insult and derision.  In that, he persuades no one to change their minds, and perhaps only solidifies other’s opinion.  Completely self defeating if one is being genuinely argumentative in pursuit of persuasion.  However, trolls never are.
Trolls like Ride-By relish attention, any attention—even negative.  Note how he brags about such negative attention in his above post.  You’ve really got to be one sick, narcissistic fuck to relish in such rebuke.

                Same with Columbus, Ohio which it’s supposedly the Somalian Queen City, second to Minneapolis. White and Midwestern with cordial relations with blacks wasn’t good enough for them I guess. They had to turn this into a dump.
Is it my imagination, or did we become more of a third world dump under the eight treasonous years of Obama? I didn’t notice America being such a sewer of humanity before that.

                “Perfect” is actually the opposite of what we need in response to Blacks supporting their own. Skin color *is* the only criteria. That the White in question is a “poor poster child” is even better. It shows White solidarity in measure for measure of Black solidarity.
Bring it on. Your donation is *not* a donation to an imperfect White woman—she is in effect meaningless or rather symbolic. It is a vote for White solidarity, and that has meaning!

            Bonus points if you figure out the house from Shelly (4600 Labadie Ave, STL) is now a vacant, bank-owned repossession in a desolate ghetto. Neighborhood now looks like early 2000’s Croatia (or 2025 Syria). They were trying to make it into a museum a few years ago, hadnt been lived in (legally) for a while. Historic preservation efforts were sponsored by (drum roll): Anheuser Busch Inc. Bud Lite: They support blockbusting AND ballbusting.

        Those of us who are over 40 years old remember the empty promises made from media, activists, and politicians decades ago regarding race relations in America. They spoke platitudes about equality of opportunities, and not equity or equal outcomes. More are finally waking up to the sham of race relations. It has only been a one-way street.

        If I know the “left,” they won’t stop until this woman is crushed and every penny of that money is taken from her. Probably and then some, maybe up to and including her kid(s). They know they cannot permit such insolence. And they will use the “legal” system to do it. Anything less would constitute capitulation, which I don’t think they’re ready to do. Maybe not even capable of doing. Minnesota courts will be only too happy to assist. So she has to leave the state. She’d be better off still to leave the country, but to where? There is nowhere in the “west” to run that won’t extradite. Canada and the UK (just to name two) wouldn’t let her in to begin with. If the DOJ CRD hadn’t just changed hands, she’d have no chance at all. As it is, her chances still aren’t good. It’s going to take a lot more than majority support, memes, and givesendgo to defend her from the jackals. In fact, the more money she’s given, the more that will enrage them and strengthen their resolve.The “Biden” admin would have also gone after everyone giving money to her. Luckily we’re out from under that. For all the dissatisfaction with Trump lately, things could be worse.

            I’d like to know when she can access that money. My understanding is that it takes five days for the transfer to become possible. We have to be approaching the last 24 hours of this fundraiser. If she does not get her hands on that money by Wednesday at the latest there will be a court order waiting for her and she’ll never see it. You can guarantee that the Minnesota AG Keith Ellison is working on thisat this very moment. The clock is going to run out on her very soon.

            Good points. What ultimately happens to her and the level of counter insurgency from bad whites will be a great reality check.
Alas, until I see otherwise my default assumption is that she will be crushed and nothing will be done to save her.
We shall see fairly soon.

            “She’d be better off still to leave the country, but to where? There is nowhere in the “west” to run that won’t extradite.”F-ck the West. Why this obsession here with it? I have noticed this repeatedly on this board. You are all DR- “dissident right”– you fully understand that you are living at the end of a dying empire. “The West” as you are naming it is simply the GAE, but in the next breath you constantly repeat ‘but go where’? Really?Pro Tip— There are other places in the world that aren’t ‘The West’. Are you afraid to go there? Probably. Far better to cling the comfort of the slowly dying corpse and live the good life than endure a little hardship living in a strange place, maybe not knowing the language, having to change your life in any way shape or form.It is simple human nature, I understand this, most people will gripe, complain, b-tch, and moan and at the end of the day, do nothing and sit quietly and passively. I am not most people however…A timely and relevant post I made from a different place just a few days ago, allow me to share—Speaking of people screaming about this woman Shiloh and her horrible racism, and their support of everything blackety black 24x7x365– I have been out of the US since February largely to escape from this. I won’t be going back anytime soon because it was making me want to harm these self-loathing f-ggots way too much. Been hovering around in Eastern Europe and “South Central” (the Balkan Nations). What a difference…First– no n-ggers. Exceptionally rare to see black and brown faces in this part of the world. When encountered, they also know their place still— for now. Until the International Cosmopolitans™ set their sights on this part of the world and start the mass propaganda, brainwashing, and importation campaign. As always, women are the attack vector for the Nose. Even here, they are a bit more pliant and compassionate than the men as is always the case but haven’t been fully psychologically captured. Met some refreshingly based women too that understand the danger of 3rd world brown people in a surprisingly realistic way, these are unicorns in the States. They effectively don’t exist because Western men are complete p-ssies and have totally lost control of their women.Balkan men are— rough around the edges. Sort of remind me of Good ol’ boys from the States, southern rednecks, and that lack of sophistication and rough nature is exactly what is needed because brown people know that in this part of the world ‘F-ck around and find out’ (FAFO) is 100% a thing. I don’t understand everyone I meet, and I myself -look- foreign here, but I am a white European at the end of the day, so its all good. I still catch some static with dudes looking at me like “who the hell are you” but its 100% more tolerable than being in any major city in the US and having random nigs and various mud races swaggering around like the own the place because they sort of do now. The US is a56% white nationat last I checked. That isBrazil Northbasically… I’ll pass.I’ll keep my Balkan rednecks, Magyars (Hungarians), and Slovaks all of whom understand the “nature of the beast” all too well. Even Poland is still better than the rest of the West but they are losing the battle because their women sadly are becoming too empowered, liberal, and westernized. Many n-gger lovers in Poland, a shocking amount actually. It repulses me, I talked to more than one blond hair blue eyed pretty attractive woman that considered negroes and dark arabs “exotic”. Like— b-tch please, they are a dime a dozen in the States and you may as well go full bestiality and f-ck a horse if you want ‘exotic’ and black c-ck. Really terrible that they have developed coalburner syndrome like the white women in the States, UK, etc.

                So if you’re so “Apex,” why didn’t you stay here with us in the West and fight back? Some of us are fighting back here, as much or more as I’m sure you ever have.
Some of us, including me, have literally shed our own blood fighting against Antifa.
Pro-tip: it’s pretty easy to sit back and criticize us in the West when you’ve done the ultimate in white flight.  I’m not impressed.

                    Apex has paid his price in years of lost wages and friends for his brushes with diversity.  I cannot blame him for looking elsewhere for attractive, White, marriage-minded women.  At least he’s not going the Han/mestiza route so many other White men sink to.

                Good for you, but it’s a lot to ask of some (apparently) random Minnesota woman, with kids, to suddenly, without notice or planning, uproot her family to a place where they don’t speak the language, and may not be the same color.

        This is separating the sheep from the goats. Over the weekend you saw the New MAGA Right (I call them “The New Christy Minstrels”) Hollywood apostates like Sasha Stone, who — as a woman — was eagerly embraced by MAGA a few years ago haul out the heavy weapons on Substack to use against fellow Whites. “Optics bad,” they say. “Single mother,” they say. “Tattoos,” say others. “Thought we were better than that, have to set moral example,” said other secular priests who otherwise have little need for priestly advice in their own lives. “It’s a psyop,” intoned others, who normally dismiss such talk as conspiracy theorizing.Then I look at the people saying such things, and most of them have no problem with homosexual marriage, having no family, and — quite frankly — living like libertines when not online. Many came on board after Covid, when for the first time in their own lives, they suffered the consequences of post-1960s Western liberalism, which they’d mostly been fine with (“Legal weed, dude! Gays are cool, dude, what’s your obsession with telling other people how to live?” while they told us how to live) until 2021.Beefy guys in F-150s with sleeve tattoos and sportsball team hero shirts and American flags threatening to get in our faces because their sons and daughters have black friends, etc., etc., while we are literally threatened with death by them.What a fascinating time. It is not often that the characters of so many people in your own life can be revealed in public by public events. I would gather most humans can go an entire lifetime without seeing it in such quantities, which accounts for the genetic survival of optimism and latency bias among humans (I doubt it exists in other animals).

            The depressing part of watching Trump win was seeing how many people ostensibly on our side are really just witless sheep looking for a hero.  I still hang on to that shred of elitist thinking that the braying morons with MAGA hats, F-150s, and mulatto grandkids aren’t worth the mud that they let their daughters shark.The Gaza thing drew the biggest line imo, between people who may not want Arabs here but still fundamentally think that bombing the shit out of children is morally offensive, and the retarded “yeehaw lets kill us some towelheads they done hate our freedom” Christcucks that can’t even get it through their megachurch addled minds that the Jews are butchering Palestinian Christians too.

                    If you want to judge the carnage in the Gaza Strip and who is being the current rabid aggressor, you need no other example than the one of several months ago where 3 of the Israeli hostages escaped the tunnel system, half naked, to surrender to their liberators (IDF).  They were immediately gunned down—no questions asked, no quarter given—only to later be identified as “friendly fire” casualties.  The IDF says they are looking into the matter….    🙁The above doesn’t even count the numerous “humanitarian aid workers” taken out in their marked vehicles.  I’ve no dog in this fight, but I can tell when a military—at least on the ground—is out of control.  Compare such to the painstaking American occupation of Iraq and the onerous rules of engagement they were subject to.

                        And what about the absolute mob of Israeli citizens demanding soldiers who were arrested because they sodomized a Palestinian to death be released? Probably some rando Pali they picked up off the street, to boot.These people have no business advising, DIRECTING, or being involved with our military whatsoever! Is it a coincidence that we were “anal feeding” prisoners at Gitmo once we got involved with Israel and their wars? And weren’t they smearing menstruation blood on them as well? All kinds of sexually sadistic stuff. This seems to be a theme with these stuck in the desert religious tribes.I guess the promotion of circumcision for ALL American baby boys should have been a clue. No wonder they think we are stupid and gullible, because we were. The fog is lifting though.

        “The core assumption of our racialized society is that it is the duty of whites to adjust to the other races. No one ever demands that the other races try to act white, as saying such a thing has been declared immoral. ”When I moved out of a big globohomo capital city, I realized the extent to which this is true. Things like smelling weed while going to work at 7:00am. Or being in a subway car and seeing blacks dancing and begging for money. Or, while driving, having to pay extra extra EXTRA attention because blacks simply do not follow the rules when it comes to walking – they cross the street whenever they want, they cut in front of moving cars and shuffle slowly, they don’t look both ways, they just don’t care. And, you know, I don’t want to hit anyone. Yet, if I hit a black guy who basically walks into my moving car, my life is ruined.Anyone who has lived in a big city knows this is all true. I saw the looks of other Whites as they saw the same things I did. They had the “it’s all so tiresome” look of that Chinese guy inEmpire of Dust. But this is the regime we live under. You say something – not even a forbidden word, just politely ask say the dancing black guy to stop doing so – and you risk getting punched/stabbed with the media cheering about it. During the July 4th 2020 holiday in NYC, the NYPD stopped arresting people and people were setting off thousands of illegal fireworks. Eric Adams, a black guy who wanted to be mayor, told the public not to call the cops because that is muh white supremacy or something. A (black) woman in the projects asked a bunch of black teenagers to stop doing so and they killed her. Eric Adams is now the mayor. This is the insanity we live under.

            Not to quibble, but it’s not just blacks.  Before we decamped for blessedly White rural living, I had to drive amongst numberless subcons and Asians (fancy and jungle).  Stopping in the middle of the street because they didn’t know where they were going.  Pulling into a parking lot at 2 mph and leaving you behind them hanging in oncoming traffic.  Parking themselves in the left lane and going 20 mph under the speed limit.  And, on foot – blocking a retail establishment’s door because they are jabbering with other aliens or fearful of melting in the rain without an umbrella.  Doing Tai Chi in the middle of the public walking/jogging path.  I don’t want to live with blacks. I don’t want to live with mestizos.  I don’t want to live with subcons.  I don’t want to live with east Asians.  I don’t believe White life needs ANY supposed ‘spice.’

        It is a good example of how reform within the rules is probably impossible.This has to be obvious to many if not most people now. Even attempts at an American version ofperestroikaandglasnostare prohibitedeither in law or in fact. The United States is far dumber and much wealthier than the old Soviet Union, but it does share the absolute rot and corruption of it.It is of note that with the Hendrix case, as with most others, the more that emerges the worse it gets. The Somali subhuman who filmed Shiloh was a convicted yet free pedophile hanging at a public park. The five-year-old model citizen whom she called The Word of Power, to borrow from John Carter, already was stealing, likely with the full knowledge of his parent, no plural necessary. The crime, of course, is noticing any of that. People may be exhausted but this is only beginning and will get far worse unless the hammer falls. And the hammer will not fall and cannot fall within the confines of the present system, which actively will work against it doing so. Freedom of association, which KRAMER effectively ended, is the only workaround short of revolution, and the power that gave to thugs in black robes and their lackeys in the legislatures will not be relinquished voluntarily.To realize this isn’t even a black pill at this point but an acknowledgement of undeniable reality.

            Well said.  Yet this comment contradicts the celebratory post the other day, along with hundreds of wildly optimistic comments, declaring that the power of ‘raycisss’ was dead.  Needless to say, I demur.

                I didn’t say the power of “racist” was dead. What I said was, they can’t use it to get people to cower like they used to. Too many people like us speaking out. Whenever I’m called one, I usually say, “So what?”

                I missed this earlier. It isn’t a contradiction unless the “death” of the power of “racist” and systemic reforms are equivalents, which they are not in my view. The racism accusation’s loss of power is societal change divorced from a system that wants to keep the weapon intact but finds it increasingly hard to do. “Death” certainly is overstated, but as this case shows, the epithet no longer is as effective or powerful, even if it can inflict harm to some degree because of a system that will not change along with society it tries to control. And because the system increasingly is at odds with the larger society, it cannot be reformed from within.

        The support for Hendrix is likely a lot bigger after the black thug who killed the Metcalf kid was given reduced bail, his parents got a lot of money and he is being treated like a hero by blacks.

This one two punch is only possible due to social media. Thus the desire to heavily censor social media.

                That’s huge. Japan doesn’t have niggers either – and even the few they have is too much. I hear they are largely ostracized and often denied entry and are even deported on a regular basis.

                But also, more innocents are railroaded, juries never doubt an institution, and crimes ignored for corrupt/political reasons are never investigated.
Japan is notorious for all that, and now it’s on the same path we were, all its high-trust cultural infrastructure being taken over and turned against the people before they realize it’s not theirs anymore.

        This woman is a bit spicy because of living on the periphery of proper society. Has the usual minor infraction legal track record. Only people like her would even bother to take her child to a park with any black children. Most know even the toddler nigglets are aggressive.
I see the Naacp is fundraising for the child, it’s all 100 percent racial grift for them.

            She took her child to that park because that’s the only resource available to her. Millions like her have been coerced into living like this. It’s an energy source, a wellspring of outraged support if only the conditioning can be burnt through and realization made widespread.

                True.  It has become normal in our (White, affluent) neighborhood for folk from elsewhere to use the neighborhood facilities for their children’s recreation.  For example, hundreds stop by on Halloween to trick or treat.  Many picnic around the area’s riparian areas and water.  As long as they are a white, I have little concern, but do take note—they don’t live here.  We are somewhat of an oasis in the desert.

                    My nabe is solidly middle- to upper-middle class, and probably at least 85% white, with the vast majority of non-whites being Hispanic. Alas, it is hardly uncommon to see Hutus in the park down the street chasing a ball around. Unless repulsed by force, they will not remain in their own pens.
And, yes, we get the dusky trick-or-treaters, too. Largely for that reason, we no longer participate in that old Halloween tradition.

                            Gosh, how many of us have had your “experience”.  It’s terrible at the moment, but in the reflection of time, a good “life lesson” in race relations!I remember such a lesson vicariously learned through an unfortunate witnessing.  At the AZ State fair one year, was a White mother and her very young toddler son.  Around his arm was tied a helium balloon.  The young boy was having the time of his life holding on to mom’s hand and shaking the ballon up and down while laughing looking all around.  One always rejoices in a young child’s happiness.  Right?Unfortunately, they walked past a couple of fairly young Blacks, one of whom was smoking a cigarette—hence I noticed him immediately (smoking at such a young age).  The feral Black youth popped the balloon with his cigarette as the toddler and mother passed by.  The toddler began crying and the two feral Blacks ran into the crowd.  The mother did not see the incident as the Blacks attacked from behind.  Not sure of the toddler.These people are not us.  They have learned no basic, universal values at any age (such as harming a young child).  They can only destroy.Now the lesson for me was not immediately learned in its entirety all at once, but it was a seed planted.  It grew….

Soon we’ll be playing ‘find the white person’. I remember laughing when the black guy was telling us about a station wagon full of kids in Iowa looking at him like he was Bigfoot, they couldn’t believe he was really real.

                I saw a story recently about a Pakistani woman who severely injured a white girl in a hit and run.  She is claiming in court to have the mental capacity of a child, despite having attended college in Pakistan.

                I guess you haven’t experienced this. You assess the odds when going here, we have. If it is halfway decent place then act in your own interest. If the black kid is playing on the swing, go on the slide. Stay comfortably away and if more show up, leave.

        No one ever demands that the other races try to act white, as saying such a thing has been declared immoral.No one acknowledges this, but I believe that what we call the Left wants this implicitly. I’m not doing the DR3 here, but when leftists say they want “opportunity for disadvantaged people” and there’s “systemic racism” and “police brutality” what they actually mean is that whites built the institutions and they are perplexed as to why blacks and other minorities cannot live well under them. Lefties certainly are not HBD scholars. So what they actually want is POC to live well under the systems that whites have built and are maintaining, but POC simply cannot. POC have different ideas about living standards, morality, justice.To us this is very obvious, but for leftie and normie, it is perplexing as to why you’d want to live around trash and not have a functioning local government. Ergo, it must be some kind of “hate” that keeps POC from achieving the way whites view achievement.

                This is what I think is actual “white supremacy”. It’s Liberals (left and right) who think just exposing them to liberty and free markets will turn them into Anglos. Why is the Anglo way the best way for everyone? For example I don’t want Thais to have a stock market and F-150s. I want them to have noisy bazaars and Buddhist temples. I don’t expect nor want them to “act white”.

Who has been marauding into other homelands looting them,  enslaving them, trying to bring democracy to them and turning people into Christians?  And when that fails, regime change.What you are witnessing is the blowback of your failures in Iraq, Libya, Syria and a host of other African and Asian countries trying to fight communism, terrorism, evil dictators and a plethora of other imaginary boogeymen.The Bantus that you rant against did not come on their own free will to the United States.

                            Nobody said whites don’t bear considerable responsibility for our own multiculti misery. But just because we did dumb things in the past doesn’t mean we must compound the problem by foregoing necessary remediation. Now that goes primarily for the Hutus.
As for the rest of you wogs, there is no logical reason to allow you to live among us just because of neocon idiocy around the globe. And at any rate, we were never involved militarily in India, yet we’re being swarmed by Pajeets, so the invade-invite imperative doesn’t really hold all that much water anyway.

                There may have been a few such social reformers The number of them that let nons into their neighborhoods was miniscule. It always was about punishing someone else for not having the “right” opinions.

            Leftists cannot believe people–the majority, really, do not want to live lives that mirror theirs. They are religious fanatics of a sort and think the unbelievers just haven’t been given a chance to convert.

                Poisoned fruit of the “enlightenment.”  I still hear variations almost daily online, by pundits, commenters, YouTubers, etc.  “Ultimately we all want the same things . . . we all love our families . . . ”  NO.  There is no “We.”  And Whites do NOT want the same things as blacks, as subcons, as Han, as Australian Aborigines.  People are not fungible.  Those on the putativeright (mainstream and dissident) are just as likely to believe and repeat this lie as those on the left.

            Actually, most wogs live quite well in white systems, albeit perhaps a bit uneasily. The exception is the nuggras who are so stupid and dysfunctional that they cannot help dashing to the ground a platter of paradise that is handed to them. That said, although the nuggs generally live in revolting squallor, it’s still a dam’ sight better than how they’d be living back in Africa where they belong.

                This.  The point being that the “talented tenth” fled the “ignorant ninth” and (until recently) took up in the White neighborhoods and became the tokens in the White organizations.  This blinded most Whites and to an (fading) extent still does.

                Sadly, of all the wogs (never heard that one before) living in the US, blacks have the best claim of being Americans.  They’ve been here for many generations and do not have any foreign citizenship.  They would be a stateless people if we were to try to remove them.  Sadly, they are also the least capable of fitting in to White society.
The South had the solution all along.  Let us pray the South will rise again.

        “The question is how did it get to this? Like the Somalis in Minnesota, the public was never asked about any of this. The people who decided on the new rules never campaigned on them or asked for public support. They just did it.”————That’s your beloved administrative state. Those jobs were filled by activists and Ivy Leaguers who were then given the power to run amok. They answer to nobody and our ineffective lawmakers refuse to rein them in. In fact, they are completely on board with singing from the kumbaya song book.I remember John McCain once berating somebody at a town hall, talking about our entitlement obligations and why we have to have immigration to pay the bills. “Muh, that’s not who we are™.” Now shut up, racist.I guess they feel no moral obligation to stand behind their word that the 1965 immigration act would not change the demographics of this country. Again, shut up racist.

            “That video exists because we are about to find out who shall overcome whom.”Jews.   Are you willing to overcome them?  Because they’re betting hard that you won’t.This whole problem may not have literally begun with Jews, but it exists at this moment because of the force and power of organized Jewry.  Without Jews as legal political and financial enforcers, whites would have simply walked over all these teensy picket fences decades ago.Say it out loud: America has been destroyed by Jews.If you’re not willing to say it, they will just keep on destroying it.  It is what they do, destroy goyisch things.

                    Exactly. The Jews are the junior partner even to this day, and it seems the Puritanical senior partner is ready to kick them to the curb, too (not that it does us any good beyond schagenfreude).

                        I don’t know about that. The Jews have so much money these days that I think they’ve become the senior partner. Of course, they can’t relax because they know we can take it away from them just because of sheer numbers, but I think they have the power today and they are the ones who run things. If they didn’t, this country wouldn’t have been almost completely sterilized of all Christianity in the public space.

                            The height of their power was some time back despite today’s wealth. That’s not to say they aren’t incredibly powerful, which they are, but the OG problem still is paramount. The Gentile nature of the alternative and rising technocratic elite has to be noted. It may prove worse in the long run but it is refreshing to have somewhat more traditional faces in the power structure.

                                It’s a tough question, and I can keep walking it back through centuries, yet still keep finding them as the source in their cultivation of the greediest and most ruthlessly ambitious members of the ruling class.
When do you estimate the height of their power is? I think today is, personally. The tikkun is seriously olamming.
Also, of the Techno cabal directing Trump, Musk and Luckey Palmer seem to be the only goys on the team (and Luckey was radicalized to a “take no prisoners” attitude by jews screwing him hard in Silicon Valley.)

                                Another aspect of this particular story, which is somewhat unrelated to the one we are discussing here, is the emergence of crowdfunding. That doesn’t quite rival Jewish power and influence but it challenges it. All the small contributions to Shiloh represent thousands of people.

Nah. It wasn’t jewish money that brought Microsoft to its knees, and made it kowtow to the feds.
It always amazes me how people think money turns people into supermen. In fact, it mostly turns them into slaves to the current thing, because they have so much to lose.

                    During the Civil War, Gen. Grant issued an order banning Jewish merchants from union camps and their environs in none-too-flattering language. He was forced to rescind the order.
When he ran for President, he felt obliged to walk back the fact that he ever issued the order and declare his love of Jews.
You don’t do that for people who have no power.

                The problem is that most people don’t see the shapeshifting.  Jews in private are tribal supremacists who import low IQ tribes they can divide and conquer.  But in public they are just smart whites who rise to the top because of their IQs.

        Excellent essay! And the usual suspects aren’t just condemning Whites to the torments of the diverse. They are also expecting the Good Whites to go after those who transgress their progressive religion. It is the colleagues, family and friends of Shiloh Hendrix—Whites for the most part—who they are demanding ruin her life. So, for Whites, diversity is not simply a bitter social tax, but also fertile ground for promoting White fratricide.

So many commercials venerate/celebrate them. The use of swiffers, driving electric Volkswagens, most skin care commercials now. And then you go into the real world and I cannot think of a better example of TV fantasy and reality.

        I retired and closed my privately held company after 35 years.  It’s best to close than to sell and see it destroyed.  In the end, I had just over 750 employees that were well trained, mentored and given every possible opportunity to advance.  I never had any walk outs, unions, confrontations or issues.  All this because I ensured, personally that only WHITES would be hired.  No department ever suffered tardiness due to BPT.  It was as though a piece of 1950s society had been reborn.  All things come to an end.  Every now and then I hear from former teammates describing the living hell they experience at other organizations.  God help them all.

            Nice. I could never stand the regulations that kicked in at 50-ish employees, and now, 25.
I took the opposite approach on sell vs. close. I’d rather not shut the doors and kick everybody to the curb. I’m not going to live forever, and I figure it’s easier to keep something running than to create from scratch. If the next generation can’t even keep the wheels on, they probably cannot create it.

        It is interesting that the establishment media hasn’t really touched the Shiloh story. They must be afraid of the blowback. That makes perfect sense for the Fox News/talk radio cucks, as their position depends first and foremost on gatekeeping, but ordinarily the neoliberals would be all over this.My guess is the smart ones figure this one might let the genie out of the bottle, and help legitimize racial awareness and solidarity among Whites. So best to ignore it, and let the story die. The problem, as usual, is blacks themselves. Black twitter is seething, and they want this woman’s head. Given that this is Minnesota, they just might get it.

        I keep seeing comments online saying ‘White people need to grow a spine!’  But this isn’t about cowardice.  It was never about cowardice.  It’s always been about accepting their premises, and an Anglo sense of nose-to-the-grindstone forbearance.  We tried – we really tried, and in good faith too.  The fault is not ours.
Now all bets are off.  The noticing has begun.  The Saxon WILL Hate.  And it will be Glorious.

        Oh, by the way, there’s a funny local zoning issue. In one of our suburbs here, a mosque bought the long vacant office building for BMW Financial Services. They want to turn it into a mosque and community center and their zoning variance was rejected. They are suing in court and I doubt they get anywhere unless they can prove some kind of ill intent on the part of the suburb, which I doubt they will be able to prove.In the meantime, someone got the brilliant idea to pack city council with Muzzies. I guess three Muzzies are running for city council in the suburb, of course, as Democrats.The comments on the Facebook page for the local paper were golden. Of course, they ended up pulling the story because the comments were out of control, but I’d say of the white people posting, it was 80% or 90% anti-Muzzie. People can see what what’s going on and when they cried racism, they were reminded that they’re treated better than they treat Christians and gays. The funniest comments were about how white people didn’t want Hilliard, Ohio to become Dearborn, Michigan.Another fun day on the internet, but there is a serious point here. As one person on another page once said, “Immigration is like spice. A little bit of spice can enhance your food and make it better. Dump a whole can in there and you’ll ruin your meal.”

But the former Mrs Gates and former Mrs Bezos are spending hundreds of millions from inexhaustible divorce settlements on a regular basis supporting groups who back the takeover of local politics to punish the dirt people for existing.
A half million to a rando feels good, but accomplishes nothing.

                Noted.  Women, on the whole, are insane and destructive.  The evil they are doing with their millions is staggering.  Agreed – giving to Shiloh solves nothing, other thangive one less than prosperous White and her children a chance at a better life away from the POX.  And at the moment, that is about all one can do – help one individual White.  If we all took such simple steps (kill your tv, don’t imbibe any advertising, raise and teach your own children, etc.) we might make a collective difference, but to Silent and Boomer Whites, White individuality is sacrosanct and any collective consciousness and action is ‘communism.’

        This is a massive hot-button issue for me personally.  I’ve mentioned many times before that the issue of race is the only issue that matters. Nothing invokes the hateful rage I often have these days like the criminal race can. Unlike some here, I despise them with every fiber of my being. I can’t stand the sight of them. They are the single most destructive force on planet earth.While it is encouraging to see the support she’s gotten, I can’t help feel that this is a flash in the pan and nothing more than an opportunity for our morality police to make an example of her.  Her and her family’s life is destroyed.  Neither of them will be able to work ever again and make no mistake, she will be arrested and brought up on charges for calling the animals exactly what they are. It is a wonder that God allows the negro to exist. To me, there is nothing worse on planet earth.

        Right now there is a lot of noticing going on about race and the tribe. This has led to the Hendrix monetary windfall for saying the magic word.

This is only possible because of Gaza. Gaza got Trump in power by a convincing campaign that he was best for Israel.

What happens when and if Israel feels secure? Can they get the noticing back in the bottle or is that genie out for good. It will probably take a Bolshevik reign of terror to fully stop the noticing. Well they did it once. Can they do it again?

            That was one of the two major Trump blunders. Had he a lick of common sense, he would have washed his hands of both the ME and Ukraine. He could have plausibly laid the blame on Biden. Maybe still can for Ukraine but it’s going to be pretty hard to distance himself from the Houti policy he made.

        If anything you do or say is deemed to be discriminatory by the courts or someone empowered by the courts, you can find yourself in a jungle of moral contradictions.
What I find most galling is not so much that The Word is proscribed, but that the enforcement is so racist: blacks can use The Word sixty times a minute and even put it in their “music,” but woe betide you if you, as a white person, sing along.

            I remember when one white girl got destroyed for rapping along to a line that contained the magic word at a concert after the rapper brought her on stage. After she was doing what she was invited to do at the concert – “sing” along to a song – he said she can’t say the magic word. This is where we are at. That rapper, of course, got invited to play the Super Bowl after millions of White people started “singing” his popular song last year.

                I listened to the early stuff back when I was still a Commie; I remember first hearing Grand Master Flash on the radio, and the energy blew disco clean out of the water, but it all quickly began to sound the same.
So I listened to New York, New York again, and I notice they don’t use the word at all, the race-thing is merely hinted at, and the lyrics rhyme. Still a good track, IMO.

        I really like Z’s axiom of the rights-based state versus the permission-based state. That is another way of noting America’s transition from an adjudicative state to a declamatory one. The former, as Z points out, was essentially a neutral arbitor between provate claimants. The latter was a partisan entity bent upon imposing its moral will upon its subjects.It’s interesting, by the way, that this transition occurred in the immediate post-war period. One gets the sense that America saw its victory over fascism in WWII as embodying a divine imprimatur that justified America using its newfound power to fight communism abroad and racism at home. The victory in the Cold War provided yet another moral filip, which justified the imposition of Globohomo across the planet and trebling the attacks on whites domestically. As America became more powerful it became more self-righteous until it ceased being America at all and instead morphed into a demonic hyperpower. This is where we are today.

                    Sports fan, I’d be happy to read any objection or rebuttal you canthinkof. Feel free to express it in terms of how best to keep your needless amusement industry alive and well during a rebellion against your empire of glory seeking, property grasping, Masonry, and Zionism.

        I would argue that this issue really is about good versus evil. Evil men and women engineered an invasion into this country with the explicit and intentional purpose of destroying who we are. They want to sow extreme anger and hatred, and thereby induce civil violence which pits the bottom of the social pyramid at each other’s throats. When the plebs are killing each other, the elites feel safe in their enclaves and can use the chaos to justify imposition of tyranny. The solution to this problem is the drone.

                This is not to imply — I hope — that the old-fashioned method of Woodchipping is wholly to be abandoned?

        Milken V. Bradley is important to this discussion concerning the freedom of association because it deals with the issue of de jure or de facto segregation. Of course, the left wants to reshape society and have used federal money to build low income housing in affluent – essentially white – areas.

        People who refuse to behave according to the norms of a country do not belong in that country. Period. That’s really all there is to it. It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with cultural norms and the level of entitlement felt by africans – and which dictate their behaviors since 1964… Hold them to the identical standards to which whites are held and either they’ll change and begin to act civilized (LOL), or they can GTFO, which I’d happily pay taxes to support. The issue with women is identical – EVERY “rights” group demands superiority – NONE demand equality.

        The point of power is power. There is no particular reason a Distric Court Judge could hold all marriages between White men and women illegal. And the kids of such union placed in foster care. And White men forbidden from having sex with anyone, White women mandated to have sex with vibrants. Call it Divine Right of Kangz.There would be an enormous amount of grift to be harvested by judges, lawyers, and such carving out “exemptions” for such orders and seizing property of those who were in violation.Meanwhile, people like Musk, Zuck, Bezos, Larry Ellison, and Bill Ackman are still in the crosshairs. If Congressional Reps throw the midterms to Dems to impeach Trump and Vance and install Hakeem Jeffries, it will be curtains for those Oligarchs. As will it be for the Defense Industry that Trump is promising a windfall to, and those in Wall Street profiting from lots of volatility in trading. Our side is loosely aligned with Trump so this matters. A Judge that can do lawfare against Trump can do it against Musk (and has), and also Bezos or Ackman. Lots and lots of cadres look at that money and power and figure its theirs. [FWIW the Girl Boss Chancellor Judge is herself judging in Delaware the law stripping her of her authority to take stock/money from companies, as most non Dem companies flee Delaware. The wages of Girl Bossery is death.]Look at the 100% Tariff Trump is imposing on Disney and others making films abroad. Now the Regime can’t just fight on St. Kilmar territory, or other tariffs, they have to defend Disney and slop Marvel and slop Star Wars.

            ‘The wages of Girl Bossery is death’.  Yup.  It is ruination.My dad died more than 50 years ago, my mom not long after.  My brother passed about a decade ago, and that’s all there was.  He was a year older, helped me along especially in initial years as an interpreter, during the babble-talk phase.We lived together off and on over our adult years.  There’s no one in the world now that can know me quite like he did.  It leaves a mark.My God will resolve the issue of this loss in due time.  It’s not proper to grieve overlong, and He’s not into endless sadness.  In the meantime, I advocate for issues of brotherhood, masculinity and fatherhood, so others may benefit as I did.I mentor a few young men seeking guidance and companionship through their feminist societies, and I’ve also been blessed with two ‘little brothers’ in my later years.  These things help keep the whole vibe alive, but your brother passing is a puzzle-piece out of you, for sure.  I am an optimist, long term, concerning these matters of separation, so I’ll just leave you with that.

        1) Don’t assume the Hendrix Affair is real.  It could be an orchestrated psy-op.  I simply don’t trust ANYTHING I don’t see and know about first hand.
2) “the public was never consulted”:  the public is never consulted nor should they be!  They are sheep that can be made to be convinced of anything at will.  They HAVE to be lead.  To hell with the public, unless the public means landed white males with a dedication to and stake in sanity and decency.

            Occam’s Razor is the Somali brain surgeons were trying to stage something but they fumbled. It’d be strange for anyone on the gay-race-communism side to collaborate with Hendrix, although her thin-blond-prole charisma is undoubtedly a factor in the publicity. In the social media era thottie privilege has been quite a force multiplier; and when you combine that with something as objectively innocuous as carrying your kid around a park in the middle of a day, it’s even more effective.

        “In one decision we went from a world where private parties were free to make contracts with one anotherfor whatever reasons they likedto a world where private parties must seek permission from the state before entering into a contract.”That would mean that courts would have enforced a contract to kill a judge, or a gasbag of the pulpits, or a banker. It suggests also that back in the days of crown and altar, the courts of the colonies would have enforced a contract formed to subvert the king or parliament. It means that the courts would have enforced a contract formed by timocrats who sought todefame the king, or to accumulate supplies for an insurrection, and or to recruit muscle at ins and taverns.

            You are not very good at generalizing, are you? Or is it just that you are unfamiliar with the system as designed and practiced?
Courts rarely compel either side to complete the contracted action. They instead either decide that the contract’s own enforcement clauses should be respected, or they invent a suitable enforcement clause on their own.

        Shiloh Hendrix is being harassed by Africans because 70 million other Shilohs — right down to their Karen Cut coif — opened America’s door to the world in order to strike a blow against The Patriarchy and bravely destroy the Raciss and Sexiss United States.Meaning, the Shilohs making war against white men in order to seize wealth and power, destroying every sphere where males gather (including the Boy Scouts) and turning every institution against white men.Shiloh, btw, is both a town and a messianic title.  It means peace, tranquility, and points to the (very) masculine figure of Christ in a religion based wholly on the Father and the Son — the masculine duad.  Kind of a skinsuit-wearing deal there.The American Shilohs are the army that polices the modern Victim Society and maintains the totalitarian State.  If they seek the responsible party for harassment by the hordes THEY invited in, let them gaze in the mirror.  My empathy on this matter is so low it doesn’t register.

            While I normally share your opinions on the destruction that feminism has wrought, now is not the time to turn on our women. Whatever your opinion of Shiloh is, she is one of us and she at least had the courage to take a stand. When more White men start doing the same, the women will follow.

            No. They were Deborahs. Deborah’s crime was liking a young prince because he was wealthy, he was civilized, and her father and brothers were uncouth savages, cruel and vengeful even to their concubines.They forced the young prince to strip his foreskin, then on to enslave the town and force all the men to strip their foreskins in a forced conversion to their barbarous god, and then they killed everyone anyways.We let our Deborahs listen to batshit crazy yentas because of gullible yahwehst “conservatives” who just want to beat someone, anyone weaker than themselves, that they might kiss the hand that holds the whip.

        Like the cases cited, I get the feeling the ‘event’ that is the main topic is not organic. It feels like a setup of some kind, whether a grift for the “$1 million’ goal, or some other purpose.
My intuition says it is fake.

            And if your intuition turns out to be wrong, will you spend time re-assessing your prior beliefs that led you to that incorrect intuition? Because this is a decent litmus test of intuition. It’d be a shame to have it turn out to be real and not learn anything from one’s incorrect assessment of the incident (for future such incidents, for this is not the last).

                Well. That’s pretty aggressive, with a lot of assumptions from someone that does not know me. It reeks of ‘internet’ tone and since you know zip about my “prior beliefs” …. which based on your geeky tone I am going to fathom a guess — note just a guess … exceed yours in real world terms in this and other streetwise realms by a lot.Some tatted up woman calls some black kid the dreaded ‘N’ word and pockets half a million? What exactly beyond the Clown World Olympics am I supposed to ‘take’ out of this?That blacks commit most of the crimes? No shit there, Sherlock. That child molesters hang around parks, some are trouble makers on other levels? Wow, thank God I have a guy on the internet to clue me in.Gee, no way, not even .0001% this might be the latest in a wave of race-baiting “news” … since it is ‘presented’ as news?

            Looks to me like a pedo was at the playground filming the kids, caught this by accident, posted it online, and here we are. The baizuo mob then promoted it to say “LOOK AT THE RACIST,” which gives meaning to their lives, but it kinda backfired. That’s my take.

                My take as well. It may have gone on too long just to disappear the story, too, which is the normal response to a backfire.

                    If it were a “left” psyop I think I’d be seeing it on the front page of reddit, but not a peep. So either it’s an ourguys psyop, or this woman was brilliant enough to figure out that saying The Word Of Power on camera would make her a millionaire (really, who could predict that?), or it’s an organic event. I’m going with C.

                Wait, wait, WAIT! There is no proof, none, nor statement by the accused that she indeed did utter the Cursed Word.
Worse, as Jeffrey says, what if the “urban” mom and L’il Autistic didn’t even exist? What if this is strictly the Ilhan Omar pedo vote enriching the American tapestry with terms like “grooming gang”?
(Or Kamala/Mayorkas’s “missing 300,000”? 88,000per yearare “lost” in the CPS/foster care system.)
