        It’s too bad there isn’t a smart opposition party here.  This is the perfect time to peel off some black voters who are angrier than most in the country about all this.
Plumb opportunities like this don’t come along too often.

        “How can anyone bargain with a madman willing to die for his cause?”
It’s even harder to bargain with a madman who is eager and willing for *you* to die for his cause.

        The black politician faces little consequence for his support of illegals–a constituency which has replaced blacks in the workforce–because he knows that his voters are more tuned to benefits than work, and that what work they are looking for is in government at all levels. Employed or unemployed the benefits are from the same source.

        Hey now – the Republicans are also pushing for annesty and H1B visas. We need more political parties – the two we have are a nightmare.

        Ah yes, the Cuban “Freedom Flotilla”, because it was all about “for the children”, and Fidel’s charity.Strangely, Cuba “suddenly” had more empty institutional beds available for pending “political” criminals, and their “budget problems” for attending to  the retarded/ criminally insane dropped dramatically.Looked pretty good for the crew of “Sicko” indeed!

        Lunacy indeed. Rangel survived a recent primary against a Dominican-born opponent by a narrowest of margins. If he decides to run in 2 years, few doubt he’ll be so lucky again. Ponder this – a congressman from Harlem, elected &amp; re-elected 20 times almost ousted by immigrants, many of whom are here illegally. Spanish-speaking mulattoes prefer one of their own to a grizzled AA politico. If blacks think latinos are their allies against whites they’re deluded. Every tribe is on its own &amp; has to look after its own tribal interests.this blog became a daily must-read. Thanks to American Digest for original linkage.

        I can’t think of a single progressive initiative that does not contain a “punish the guilty” element. The fanatics seem to still be fighting the bullies in grade school and have an endless supply of rage to fuel their actions. That’s why they win and we lose. It’s like the prisoner/guard scenario. The prisoner can focus on escape 24/7, while the prison guard is distracted by normal life. Reality is the only thing that is keeping conservatism afloat. This is why fanatics are so offended at reality/consequences, and will do anything and everything to suspend it. Printing money, lie, murder.
