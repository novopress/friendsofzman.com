        Ghettos require riot police and fences and those cost money.  Why not just keep ruthlessly atomizing society until all you have is a gas (the analogy here being the the behavior of gasses is very easy to predict… solids and liquids much less so) of people who you can very easily control.  Drugs, sex, the state in place of the family… OK, Aldous already was all over that one.I’m just playing with the dialectic here, so don’t hate on me, but why just not use a culling strategy?  Start with anyone with an IQ under 80 and work your way up as capital deepening and productivity rise.  It’s not like our elites have shown much hesitation in the past when it comes to killing very large numbers of Armenians, Jews, Slavs, ungoodthinking petty bourgeoisie, etc. over the past century.  When you have large numbers of truly unemployable (no more need for porters, wheat reapers, ditch diggers and all the rest of the pre-industrial labor pool.  Not much need for IQ 100 jobs like  steno and typing pools, phone operators, and filing clerks either).But there are still parts of the planet populated by large numbers of freeholders armed with guns.  They might fold, but they might fight either a Brave New World or Soylent Green.  So instead of risking civil war, why not invest in intelligence boosting medical research?  Back in the days of when it was OK to use the scientific method to study the roots of intelligence, scientists used to try to correlate the size of the brain pan with IQ.  They found that while size does matter, there were some really smart people with well below average sized skulls, so some brains seem to be wired more efficiently than others.  Could we have an intelligence revolution like we had (God bless Norman Borlaug) a green revolution?  Rather than declaring ever larger numbers of our fellow men obsolete, can we bring them along for the ride?  All of the evidence indicates that we’ve maxed out the benefits of mass education.  So all that is left for us is science without an exclamation point.

        For every locality __A__ the term “the government of A” refers to the largest dealer in interpersonal violence in that locality (definition, after Weber). The size of a government is a function, in part, of the speed of communication and transportation.  For a government to cohere, orders and troops must move from the center to the periphery in time to meet challenges. Most large empires were noted for their communication and transportation technology: Egypt for the Nile (lower the sail and drift downriver, raise the sail and sail upriver), Rome, the Inca, and the Americans for roads. Qin Shi Huangdi standardized axle lengths and built roads and canals specifically to supply his army.In terms of the speed of communication and transportation, the world today is smaller than Rome at its height or Han Dynasty China. National boundaries may persist for a while, like ancient mid-continental  plate boundaries or flaws in a block of ice.Perhaps this answers the astrobiologists’ question: “Where are they?” Perhaps once a civilization dominates an entire planet the competitive spur to further advance in transportation technology wanes.

        If civilization can somehow keep itself out of the One-World Feudal Oligarchy so ardently desired by our control-freaking satanic ‘elites’, then I think we will have nation-states for a good long time to come.  There will be different cultures, and they will primarily be based on geography and language, as they are now. Many smaller, more independent states might emerge and thrive, as we become globally wealthier through better energy technologies etc.That is a pleasant dream, isn’t it?If it’s going to happen in any kind of a peaceful fashion, I think it will probably begin in America. The US could probably evolve into a a federation of a half-dozen or more countries that would work better than it does now. In fact, if the US political system were simply re-balanced to the point originally intended by the founders, that would be ideal. And it would be a shining example for the world to follow.

        I question that a civilization that has accumulated the habits of civilization under nationalism can retain them without it.

        New opt outs if we indeed do vote to stay in Europe will leave Britain stronger and more independant than the last 20 years.

        If the Post-National World happens will be limited to Europe and North-America with maybe Latin-America and some Asian countries like Korea and Singapore joining.
