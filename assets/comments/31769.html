        Here is a good video without any hyperbole. Includes the collision and the bridge collapse, and an educated opinion of why the ship wallowed as it did.https://youtu.be/qZbUXewlQDkIt looks like an engine fire. Lights all went out, then black smoke starts belching from the stack. Collision itself just after the 5 minute mark.The NYTimes has a blow-by-blow that was pretty good for a while (later entries succumbed to OMGism) and reports were the pothole repair crew working on the bridge got word the ship was in trouble and had closed the bridge to traffic. Eight workers landed in the water, of those six are still missing. The vehicles lost were clearly parked, not moving, so presumably belonged to the repair crew.

        This website seems to have some good info and is being updated as new information comes in. The latest is that the ship warned the shore and police did start stopping cars. 6 construction workers are still missing.

        Baltic Shipping is reporting the boat captain is Ukrainian:

            The ZH post that has been getting periodically updated has one more recent update beyond the one at 1423ET in which this information was revealed. In tlhe succeeding one at 1508ET, Gen. Flynn says that it is too early to dismiss the possibility that this event was not merely an accident, and possibly a planned happening. This seems prudent.But then, FedGov seems eager to preempt these sorts of speculations, don’t they? Consider their announcement immediately on the heels of the event that the Crocus City attack wasabsolutely ISIS-K, and certainly had not a thing to do with Ukraine.Hold your horses, there.

                For Gods sake people , sometimes a ship hitting a bridge is just a ship hitting a bridge. Boats are crashing into each other all the time. Trucks hit bridges..trucks hit Trains. Im waiting for a train to hit a ship …its probably happened at least once. LOL

        “Y’all don’t wanna be talkin’ ’bout diversity to me, especially comin’ from that side of the aisle.”
In Antebellum days she might, maybe, have made it up to the big house as an occasional belly warmer and scullery maid but it would certainly have been contingent on her keeping that satchel mouth (satchmo) firmly shut.

        The replacement bridge will become a huge grift machine.  Publicity, drama, economic impacts, no penny will be spared on environment impact studies and trade studies and the bridge planning – where some of the great money is soaked up by the grifter class – will go on for years.  And they’ll pay for it with…more tolls!Honestly, if you’re a grifter, this wreck is a gift from god.The economic efficiency angle is an interesting take.  I think the bigger issue is how much of our economy is on auto pilot.  We are but one good power outage away from total catastrophe.  If a power loss was to blame (the lights clearly go out twice), that it happened at 1:30am is nothing less than a miracle.  Thousands might have been killed in a rush hour version of that wreck.We walk a very thin line with modernity.  We saw glimpses of this during Hurricane Sandy, years ago.The US military, unable to take out that bridge in Crimea, might want to take some notes.  It is fascinating that despite thousands of years of technology, “taking out the enemy’s bridges” is still a highly effective strategy.

I had a visual of that old Buggs Bunny skit, where he turns that shyster Brodie something or other, inside out, and sells him the Brooklyn bridge.

        As a former Baltimoron I’m very familiar with that bridge. It’s one of the 2 ways that the city’s 12 remaining White people can use to go from, say Essex, to Glen Burnie. Essex is a run down suburb to the east of town and GB is a run down suburb to the south. The other way to make the trip is the Harbor Tunnel. Even when I was there 25 years ago and with the Key bridge taking at least half the traffic the tunnel was prone to backups. I can only imagine how much worse that’s going to be now. Of course you *can* just drive on surface streets through downtown Baltimore. For a variety of reasons, all of them black, this is ill advised.I actually wonder if this is going to be Baltimore’s “Portland moment”. After the Coof hysteria and the summer of Luv, basically everyone with any kind of business left Portland. What remained were giant murals of St. Floyd of Fentanyl and hobo tents – like a whole parallel city of hobo tents. Actually, in the case of Baltimore, the Portland moment might be hardly noticeable. Portland at least had a somewhat functional economy and was (mostly) safe before the Passion of the Floyd. Baltimore rotted down to the bone decades ago so the bridge collapse might hardly be noticed.Still, it’s shocking somehow to think of that bridge being gone. Maybe Z can go down there and pour out a 40 on the bridge pillars for all of us who remember it.

            Wondering if they still have the horse and carriage rides around Camden Yards?In my youth I was briefly an Oriole’s fan during the Cal Ripken era, and they would frequently show that on pre game, before the ball games.

        For those of you who need some good bridge news, the Detroit to Canada Gordie Howe bridge is near completion. That’s the second one to go along with the Ambassador bridge that has been there for many decades. How long will that name last though.

                        I’ll take a stab. If it is built within 10 years, it will be the Jasmine Crockett Memorial Bridge (fentanyl-laced extensions, so tragic). If it takes longer, it will be the Xi Jiping Triumph Bridge.

That said, Gretch’s new $500 per illegal you take in plan is likely to finish the job, particularly in the more remote areas with low incomes and lots of retirees on fixed incomes.

                Being from Buffalo, I briefly worked at a steel company that bid on the contract for the steel to build that bridge. It was not Bethlehem steel, can’t remember the name. I believe they went out of business not long after.Fighting was over where the steel was coming from, “country of origin” what to name it, and who was going to pay to fund X percentage.My grandfather used to go over every Sunday to buy Italian bread from the Ontario bakery. Used to go over to get my hockey equipment every year, and play a few hockey tournaments. When I turned 18, NYS changed the drinking age to 21, we used to load up the car, and go over to party at Crystal beach, and Don Cherry’s because drinking age was 19, hit a few strip clubs too. 😁Used to be an easy, nice ride to cross the Peace bridge. Good traffic flow. That was in the 80’s. Last time I tried a few years back, took over an hour. Before…. getting grilled by Doug and Bob McKenzie! 😂Americans went over to shop because of the exchange rate, Canadians came over to buy cheaper gas and we had a lot of Bills and Sabres fans from Ontario.Win win for both economies.Now you need  an enhanced license or passport to cross.“Papersss please” anyone?These bastard politician’s destroy everything they touch!

                    NY went from 18 to 19 to 21 in quick succession.  My sister got hosed twice as they didn’t grandfather you in.  But yes, in H.S. beer runs over the bridge were common.  No passports, no ID needed.  Just “where ya goin’?  For how long?” and Bob’s your uncle.

            As a former Baltimoron I’m very familiar with that bridge. It’s one of the 2 ways that the city’s 12 remaining White people can use to go from, say Essex, to Glen Burnie. Essex is a run down suburb to the east of town and GB is a run down suburb to the south. The other way to make the trip is the Harbor Tunnel. Even when I was there 25 years ago and with the Key bridge taking at least half the traffic the tunnel was prone to backups. I can only imagine how much worse that’s going to be now. Of course you *can* just drive on surface streets through downtown Baltimore. For a variety of reasons, all of them black, this is ill advised.I actually wonder if this is going to be Baltimore’s “Portland moment”. After the Coof hysteria and the summer of Luv, basically everyone with any kind of business left Portland. What remained were giant murals of St. Floyd of Fentanyl and hobo tents – like a whole parallel city of hobo tents. Actually, in the case of Baltimore, the Portland moment might be hardly noticeable. Portland at least had a somewhat functional economy and was (mostly) safe before the Passion of the Floyd. Baltimore rotted down to the bone decades ago so the bridge collapse might hardly be noticed.Still, it’s shocking somehow to think of that bridge being gone. Maybe Z can go down there and pour out a 40 on the bridge pillars for all of us who remember it.

The proper vernacular is “gets her hair and nail extensions did”.

        The greater the complexity and fragility of the system, the greater the number of black swans that are circling above. As Zman points out, our modern technopolitical system is so intertwined and tuned that it wouldn’t really take much to bring it screeching to a halt.
It’s becoming increasingly apparent that even a 1,000 motivated and competent people with minimum arms could bring this country to its knees in weeks.  Perhaps that is the rough beast slouching over our borders as we speak.

The following is for educational purposes only.It would take less than 50, a low eight digit budget, almost all material and equipment could be purchased or rented legally, and could be achieved almost entirely off-line.No one would have to get killed or caught.  The initial damage would be to infrastructure and to topographic features at infrastucture pinch points.It would take months to scout, plan and recruit, weeks to train for, 72 hours to put into place, and could be executed in less than 8 hours.Ten three-man teamsTen controllers over the teamsFour or five controllers over the controllersOne to say go, sometime in a late August to late September windowPorts in New Orleans and Long BeachInterstate bridges/overpasses in Louisiana, Virginia, Texas, and WashingtonLocks at Peoria and St LouisPasses in NorCal and SoCalHalf these could be missed and hundreds of thousands would die in the US due to chaos and product scarcity.  Tens of millions would die outside of the US as a result of all of this, but mostly from the resultant market failures, financial collapse and eventual global famine.The more autarkic and redundant a regime is, the better it will fare in this scenario.

                My two cents;The “spaghetti bowl”, which connects the Eisenhower/Kennedy/Dan Ryan and 55, just west of the loop, would lock up Chicago for a looooong time, if someone was creative.Just south if there, the busiest east/west corridor in the country, I80, at the Illinois/Indiana border, would bring the country i a standstill, if someone was creative.The route is always backed up/slow as molasses.(Just before the Coif, my daughter and I were going to NYC, and decided to avoid traffic by going through that stretch at 1:00 AM.We were stopped from 1;00 to 5:00 AM due to a fatal crash.We turned off the car and slept.It’s amazing how fragile this place is.

        “The people who make the economy work will figure out ways around this new obstacle in the meantime…”———————————————-Gah! I didn’t need those links to that lip-flapping boon and Steve Sailer so early in the morn, Z. Rather unsporting of you, don’t you think? 🙂 I think I’m constipated now…Col. MacGregor turned a phrase that really summed our Elites. I paraphrase: “Liars create truth bombs – and they are starting to explode everywhere…”. Hell’s bells – this blog is one of the biggest and it goes off damn near every day, HAR HAR HAR! And it is only one of many.Money talks. And – speaks loudest to our ruling elite. Their bottom lines are starting to be hit by stuff like this – and it can only get worse. You can entrench all the political correctness you want… you can make virtue signalling mandatory by law…in the end, the market always speaks. Just ask Anheuser Busch… or the NYT or the other bastions of liberal faggotry – they are watching their markets evapourate. Let us not make these guys into unkillable bullet proof demons or something they’re not.Fixing things is as simple as sweeping these people aside.and replacing them with men that get chit done. It’s happening as we speak. As a former marketing guy with a rep for getting stuff done, my question here is “Why are we importing cars? Americans invented the damn things, and have built some of the best machines on the market. Why aren’t those cars being built by Americans, for Americans? What else can we learn from this? What other things are we importing that we need to make right here? Why is it not feasible to produce them here – with all the redundancies necessary…?” Then, I’d sit back and listen. The guys that make excuses get fired, en masse. The ones that explain the situation and the fixes required stay. Twitter is an excellent example – Elon Musk fired 70% of the chair warmers without a single burp in service.This isn’t rocket science.

            Is this post satire? I do not believe so. The elites’ bottom line is not being hit, when you look at the truly elite. The NYT is simply another plaything for the rich, not essential to their status. As NYT drops revenue, one of their online counterparts increases. Further, I do not know where this workforce comes from? Or where the power to fire en masse the insipid and lazy.85% of the American workforce (employed and unemployed, and women) are worthless for the vision you propose. What is it called when 15%, the ones you want to lionize, are supporting the 85 percent?Further, if you think the 85% will be complacent and starve to death in your fabulist, invented world, I would suggest look to South Africa.

                Nonsense.Are the banks mere playthings of the elite? Dirt people almost entirely finance their cars through banks. Shrug that off, Schmuelly! Drive the people into penury so they can’t afford cars, homes, or anything else…and they stop spending money too.As for the NYT being replaced by online versions…like the Daily Beast? Like Yellow Times? Like Slate? The HuffPost? Don’t make me laugh. The only people trusting the media today are clueless geriatrics or idiots.Not saying there will not be a reckoning or painful adjustments. Not saying these guys will all vanish either… I’m saying that the current state of affairs holds because WE tolerate it. Until that changes… yeah, things are going to get worse.

                    They have student loans to replace cars. Rent to replace mortgage. Massive conglomerate banks to syphon up any small failures, and the Fed to bail out any larger issues. Some of the managers, sure, they will suffer, but the truly elite, the ones that meet at places like the Bank of International Settlements, they are more powerful and wealthier than ever.Perfect example is the Bud Light. All people did was buy their other products. Bud Light went down, Modelo went up. The old idea of Coke and Pepsi being owned by the same group. Protesting of one just funnels the masses into the arms of another – apologies for the mixed metaphor, but I am sick.

                    Hope you are right. That ad campaign, “You will own nothing and be happy” didn’t get anywhere near the pushback I would have hoped for.

            Filthie: First you proclaim that religious belief trumps biology and  thus blacks who claim to be Christian are and always have been good people.  Now you insist the magic market will prevail over virtue signaling and ideology.  Plus you have been insisting for months that White people are on the move and waking up, so the clouds had better be afraid.
I generally refuse to waste my time engaging in such fantasy, but I thought I’d make one general example today – this is how dissident blogs become laughingstocks.

                Whether acknowledged or not, and mostly it is not, the mass interstate/intrastate white migrations indicate there is an “awakening” of sorts. That isn’t the issue–the lateness is. That delayed response likely will prove dispositive to how it shakes out, unfortunately.

                        That’s certainly the plan, but the locusts will go to the gibs fields eventually, which tend to be large cities. States that have turned down Medicare expansions and so forth just aren’t that attractive to the parasites in the long haul.As a response to that last, privately owned refugee/illegal alien encampments have popped up in the boondocks. The subsidized hovels may keep ’em down on the farm a bit longer. Colony Ridge in Texas is one example. If that sort of thing fails, and I think it will, there will be so-called “legal” attempts for force them to stay in place, including mandated Medicare and Section 8 expansions. And if that doesn’t pan out, look for legislation to require immivaders to remain in states where they are dumped.

                …blacks who claim to be Christian are and always have been good people.
What’s kind of sad is that to the extent that the United Methodist Church has anything at all to do with the “faith of our fathers”, it’s because of a small number of flyover white congregations, a much larger number of black churches, largely in the southern states, and pretty much the entirety of the United Methodist – Africa conference.
The way whites split into such a high degree of shitlibbery makes a pretty good case that biology is not as determinative as one might think.

                Please do not put words into my mouth 3G.Hrmmmm. I never meant to infer that religion trumps genetics… but I might in fact embrace the notion. Let us explore it: can we agree that blacks were much better behaved in the past than they are today? If so…I’d feel safe attributing much of their growing bad behaviour problems to the collapse of Christian family values. (And for whites as well). But in the case of blacks – we also enforced harsher punishments for them in the past and understood the need to do so. There’s probably other factors that come into play. It’s a big subject.I stand by the fact that people are waking up. Perhaps I base that on anecdotal evidence… but it’s hard to ignore. Even in the heart of Conservative Inc you’re seeing it. The rat faced Ben Shapiro had to fire his pet negro – Candace Owens – because she noticed jewish perfidy and talked about it. You’d have to have a heart of stone not to laugh as the dancing monkey’s dance routine dissolves into feces flinging…😂There is panic and chaos in Washington and even in Ottawa. I believe that if they are panicking, it’s because their donors and bosses are panicking too. Regardless whether I’m right or not, the wheels are coming off, the seams are cracking and there is no hiding it.You are right not to take me seriously, I’m afraid.

        “Western countries with massive GDP’s are faced with impossibly complex economies that cannot be quickly modified to address the need to make even simple things like artillery shells”Well, one of the first problems is that the GDPs are massive because they are fraudulently pumped up or pumped up by net destruction. The next and fatal GDP inflation mechanism is going to be mass invasion in order to implement the Toilet Paper Fallacy at scale and massively increase the GDP. We are bigger than China! Yes, but uh , China is still China, and America is ???Speaking of ships from our native Motherland and the 17th century and harbor shipwrecks there is an incredible museum in Stockholm dedicated to the Vasa. It is a must see and a tribute to hubris, human folly and what happens when nobody is willing to tell the Emporer he has no clothes.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)

            The GDP metric is like a football team with a strong running game deciding that running TDs are worth 12 points now instead of 6. It was a metric that was developed and refined to make our economy look better relative to other countries. For many decades, the American economy really was so much bigger and stronger than the rest of the world that it didn’t matter, the GDP number was practically a formality, and we were benchmarking it relative to ourselves. But when the elites decided we didn’t need manufacturing, and we could replace it with paper pushing, and the GDP will go up because they determined paper pushing is more valuable than making stuff, the metric was cooked. The DEI admins at colleges are making $400,000 a year and all their economic activity is counted towards the GDP – how much value are they really adding to our economy, how much stronger is it? To say nothing of government spending which as a percentage of GDP is higher than it has been since World War 2.

                It’s a very strange way for a whole sector of professions/disciplines to behave.
Everyone knows the big three of mediagenic macro “metrics”—production, inflation, unemployment—are lies by design, reformulated again and again to get ever closer to total dishonesty. Only obscured or unused numbers reflect reality. Nerds cite them to no effect.
We assume that insiders know what’s up and have the “real numbers”—that economics is Straussian—but what do economics’ insiders do? Clip the coin of productivity (whatever that is). That isn’t “knowledge work.” It’s just stealing.
Economics: wrong or nonexistent? Punch a libertarian to find out!

                    Where economics really goes astray is trying to assign numbers to everything. One can say he prefers chocolate ice cream to vanilla, but only an economist would say something stupid like he prefers chocolate to vanilla by 20%.
Preference has no cardinal value, and one cannot give it one by aggregating or applying statistical techniques that cost at least one degree of freedom.

                The $400K a year and up DIE admins are not just adding nothing. They are part of a project that has destroyed the fabric of society along with the rest of The Left’s social fabric shredding ideas. It isn’t just a net nothing economically they represent, it is a net destruction. And, once you tear the fabric of society, particularly on racial lines, it can’t be rebuilt.

            The thing with GDP is everyone does it.  Last time I looked, government spending at all levels was about 1/3 of the then GDP of 20T.  There is all kinds of shenanigans and tomfoolery in the GDP, but the same is true of other countries as well.China has no shortage of problems either.  It is a fundamentally corrupt society with fraud and cheating from top to bottom. This is a country that installs fake drains and fake fire hydrants and where 90% of the water is unsafe to drink. Just google Tofu Dreg construction.   Their real estate industry, which is 40% of the Chinese GDP is collapsing. Vanke, Countrywide and Evergrande are all in serious trouble.  They have “ghost cities” all over the place.  Once a year on March 15th they have a TV show highlighting some of the fraud in Chinese society.  One of the items featured this year was fire extinguishers which, when you spray them on a fire, makes the fire bigger.  Another was fake fireproof glass.  They have a saying that says “if you can get away with it, cheat”

                It continues to surprise me that the chinese are corrupt.  The stereotype about asians is that they are orderly, conformist rule followers.  Where does the corruption come from?
Similarly, I am surprised that they love gambling so much.  Many of them understand probability, but they can’t stay away from the casinos.
I watched many old chinese people cut in line when a bus arrived in San Fran.

                    The Chinese shills say it’s the CCP that instills a culture of corruption.  Hong Kong and Taiwan are both filled with ethnic Chinese people and supposedly have a lot less corruption.  But I don’t really know that for sure. I try to listen to both the haters and the shills.Supposedly there is a ton of graft, especially in RE involving party officials.  Bribes have to be paid and that leaves less money for the project and so short cuts are taken.  But this does not explain the amount of corruption they supposedly have in day to day life.  Even buying food is a gamble.  Maybe the food is what they say it is, maybe it was fried in new oil, or maybe it is filled with counterfeit stuff and fried in gutter oil.  Just the fact that something like gutter oil even exists is incredible.  They literally will suck used oil out of sewers and gutters, then “clean and treat” it and put in a bottle and sell it as new oil.  No CCP officials in this chain.  Or they “recycle” used water bottles and refill them with tap water and put new locking caps on them and then charge the brand premium.  Again, no CCP officials involved.

                        I think there’s a case to be made that the thorough cultural cleansing of the Mao years, especially the obliteration of the Buddhist/Taoist and familial beliefs of your everyday Chinese, made the mainland particularly prone to creating people with no scruples.  If online videos are to be considered representative, it seems that the Chinese boomers are the worst examples of unbridled greed, while the younger generations have clawed back some modicum of trust.

                    I know enough Japanese people to understand the betting thing. Gambling is rule-following. Obey, anticipate reward; if denied, obey again. Fools who “have a system” think they’ll win by following the rules even harder—or by discerning the secret intent of the rule-makers, a message sent only to the most obedient. “Fancy” Asians are uniquely susceptible, like injuns to alcohol.

                    The Chinese use the concept ofguanxito calibrate their relationship with other humans.  It’s loosely translated as “connection” or “relationship”, but of course that doesn’t fully capture the connotations of it.  With the usual caveats, with noguanxithere exists no obligation to consider the impact of your behavior on others.  I was recently talking to an otherwise considerate Han who’s lived in the States for 15 years and she told me that it took a decade of concerted effort to learn to say “excuse me” when briefly passing through the space of others.  She’d been trained to see unfamiliar people as objects to be negotiated.

                        From videos I’ve seen (I’ve never been to China), the most shocking thing is how nobody helps a stranger.  An old person falls down the steps and everyone just walks around them. We’re talking hundreds or thousands of people.  Another video I saw was a traffic light cam video showing an old man collapsing in the middle of the street.  Pedestrians just walked around him and cars drove around him.On the flip side of this is people throwing themselves at cars and then laying on the ground shaking to do a shakedown of the driver.  Or throwing themselves down steps and then suing the first person who stops to help them.  Supposedly the reason nobody helps anyone is fear of falling for one of these lawsuit shakedowns.  To me, it just exposes two sides of the same corrupt coin.Perhaps it is just the ultimate expression of “guanxi” as you say.

                    Line:  It’s not just corruption; it’s a totally different way of thinking.  My husband was just talking about this the other day, regarding a couple of Asians he had known since high school. He said even when/if they didn’t outright cheat, they always set things up so they would have an edge.   Because why wouldn’t you?   It was hardwired in them.

                        Same story from my daughter who spent some time at college proctoring exams from a bunch of middle-easterners. They actually filed a grievance with the university that my daughter was anti-Islam. (To be fair, she is, but that’s not why she called them out for cheating.)

        This one hits close to home.As an example of over complexity and redundancy, just the other day my girlfriend, who is an import / export agent for Fed Ex, told me about these extra forms she had to fill out for the shipment of a single guitar. She thought it would be of interest to me because I was in the custom guitar biz years ago. She said the forms had to do with “species of origin” for the woods the guitar was made of.I told her ebony, used in the making of guitar fingerboards, is tightly regulated due to it being on an endangered species list, and if someone were caught using that ebony to make a guitar, ship a guitar, or buy the guitar, they’d be looking at federal prosecution, and heavy fines / jail time.In fact, when I was making custom guitars a decade ago, the Gibson guitar factory was raided by the men in black, on suspicion of a contraband shipment of ebony from Africa.I mean really… Gibson?My story here is to point to the accuracy of Z’s assessment on the ridiculous complexity piled on top of complexity of even the simpliest of things like making and shipping a guitar.Z alluded to what’s called “lean management,” regarding his Cheerios example. When I was a supervisor at a facility that made C pap masks, myself and the rest of management had to take a week long course on the concepts and purported advantages of lean management. My department that cut the material on CNC machines, was required to make just enough and a few extra in case of mistakes, cloth mask shells, for them to be taken to the plant across the street to be sewn together to the plastic face cups by little old dot  Indian ladies on second shift.They wanted nothing more than a few days worth of inventory to be ware housed. This put a lot of pressure on myself, my crew, the machine repairmen / programmer  “me” and quality control. Should one of the machines go down, and we didn’t have parts on hand to repair them common due to you guessed it, “lean management.” There would not be enough material to be finished into completed, ready to ship product that day. And heads would roll!Beyond… beyond… stupid!I shortly after quit, took the last of my savings, bought machinery, equipment, and supplies, including “ebony,” and started making custom guitars. Luckily, I was never raided by the men in black! 😂

                The backstory is telling. Nashville is a typical shitlib, leftwing city albeit a whiter one, but the Gibson owner was a conservatard who donated to McCain. Everything the dude owned was seized for a period and the DOJ really tried to bankrupt the company. The statute allegedly violated never had been enforced, and a Chinese company was ready to buy out Gibson at one point.This type targeting would play out again and again with other businesses in other cities. I can’t recall where and the details, but this same thing was tried with another one of the few remaining independent guitar makers, too. The Gangster State has been here a long time.

                Unfortunately no.Business was good up till the ‘08 crash, customers world wide; USA, Canada, England, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Japan, Australia, had a popular metal band in Sweden who were artist endorsers, then suddenly few wanted or could afford to drop $1800 – $4000 on a custom guitar. So orders fell off.I had all along been doing repair, restoration, and modification of guitars and basses as well as tube amp modification and repair in addition to making guitars. A lot of people started bringing in cheap Fender, Gibson, ESP, Charvel / Jackson etc, imports and having me modify / upgrade them, pickup swaps, bigger frets, fret leveling / crown, tuning the nuts for better action, custom paint,  etc… So I kept my head above water, but age started creeping in and I wanted a job with health bennies and pension / 401k.I never had the capital to get out to NAMM and set up a booth and network. Got close once, just before the crash.I still have all my templates and fixtures, so I may get back into it down the road.Thanks for asking brother!

            I “know” somebody who owns a few rarewood Gibsons. This person received them from an uber famous musician who was touring when the Gibson raid occurred (coincidently, I’ve been given a VIP tour of that factory which smells so right). The musician asked for a small charitable contribution and shipped the guitars which are being played privately this very day. I mean, the trees were dead already so is playing them wrong? Or should the feds get to keep them? If you can smell what I’m steppin’ in.

                That must have been cool touring the Gibson shop! And I know that smell well… It’s heavenly!
I have to ask as it’s implied… Was this famous musician dumping these guitars, for fear of an early morning raid by a fed  Swat team? Not implying anything shady on his part, just covering his ass which is a wise move.
Can you picture Elvis back in the day, being taken out in cuffs after a concert because he was playing a Gibson? 🤪

                    Very insightful. It was an emergency, quiet dumping off of illicit contraband. He’d toured all over with those things because he could get away with just about anything until that raid. Some lowkey person, perhaps a lawyer who really doesn’t fear jack squat, which can be a liability, obliged the artist and owns them for a pittance. Thing is, I’m “told” the rare woods are hypersensitive to the weather and can sound brilliant or kinda terrible if you have a good ear and aren’t playing to a crowd.

                        Ebony has a bright tone, it’s a very hard wood.The harder the wood, brighter the tone.
Combined with a softer, porous body / neck wood like Mahogany, you get the classic “Les Paul” tone. Warm with some “bite.”
Interesting and cool story.
It’s been so long I can’t remember if Gibson was found in violation.I guess your friends story confirms they were on some level.

        Zman, or other residents of the area, is it feasible to dig a tunnel rather than build a bridge? Could there be another Big Dig project, like the one in Boston?

        If one is conspiracy minded on this incident, then I think looking at Putler is looking in the wrong direction. Baltimore is the #1 AINO port for importing and exporting vehicles. Right when the regime is dead set on eradicating ICE vehicles from existence.

            I saw a video on youtube the other day about the “fragilization of the grid”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrWBLtna_ywIt’s a very interesting video.  There’s a cottage industry forming around power stability.  “Renewables” are decimating the reliability of the grid.  The guest points out that even a minor power problem can shut a manufacturing or other high tech plant down for 1/2  a shift or more. 3 phase electricity moving out of time.The Washington Post has an article up about all the new data centers in various stages of planning and construction and how there isn’t enough capacity to power them. (“Amid Record High Energy Demand, America is Running out of Power”)They don’t even get into the problems of EVs and replacing all the natural gas and oil residential and commerica heating systems with heat pumps. (basically the electrification of heat)They want to electrify everything that can be electrified all while shuttering coal and nuclear.  All the renewables are causing gas plants to run at vastly diminished capacity for good portions of the day.  This is untenable because it makes the gas plant unprofitable.  OTOH, the grid will not function without these gas plants.Bad times ahead.

        I watched the governor of Maryland speak for 10 minutes about absolutely nothing. “We’re Maryland Strong. We’re Baltimore Strong. We’ll get through this stronger than ever. Reach out and hug someone today — they need it.”
I don’t know what to say any longer about this country. It’s so cooked that I felt like cracking open a beer listening to that stupidity. I’m old enough, like Z Man, to remember when serious men would be standing at that podium. Now we have grade school counselors. It’s beyond depressing. I see no way out.

            Oh the other hand, the Governor of Maryland is prescient. His campaign slogan and his acceptance speech was a thinly veiled call to racial arms and racial triumphalism. I believe it was, “It Is Our Time Now.”
Given that the bridge collapsed, it seems like a perfect opening salvo to usher in their time.

            Cargo cult.  The people incapable of creating civilization believe that if they stand around in suits giving speeches then they will get the same results as the creators.  They cannot comprehend what was done before them and what is required now.

            AINO is a deranged, depraved and debased freak show. No sensible person could view the country with anything but the profoundest contempt. What is dumbfounding is greasy fast rapidity of the collapse in human capital. I’m not saying Americans in 1994 were a body of Pattons, Copernicuses and Descartes, but they certainly weren’t the vapid simpletons, icky fruitcakes and nauseating carny barkers who rule the roost today.

                    At the current rate AINO will be completely dysfunctional in less than 10 years. I’m constantly varying how long I think the husk can continue shambling, but events of the last year or so have caused me to move up the timetable. Wasn’t so long ago I though AINO might have another 35 years. That now seems impossible.

                        Arguably AINO is mort now. Semantics aside, at a minimum we are deeper into collapse/death twitches than it seemed just a few years ago even to people as blackpilled as me. A hot war with the vibrants at the helm at DOD and JCOS really would put paid to it, which may be why that has been avoided (and that may require more self-awareness than is warranted). We are living through it now.

        This incident is yet another warning sign of how fragile our society has become. We no longer possess the robustness of our ancestors and its reflected in artificial world we have constructed around us. And we cannot pretend our way back to robustness by garnering likes on social media; only a trail of tears and its extreme hardship can accomplish that goal. Which is why a collapse is so necessary.And there are essentially two ways this can occur. The natural way is a gauntlet of incremental challenges that culls the weak over a long period of time, but still allows for routine reproduction and fitness enhancement. The alternative is a hard slam to the bottom followed by mass violence, mayhem, and immediate culling of the weak and stupid.The elites are setting us up for the latter. You need to plan for that contingency. And no, there will be no cavalry coming over the hill to save you.

One can hope.

        These seems too purposeful to be an accident from the info so far. Just at the right time it turns to hit the part of the bridge that will bring it down and the power goes out?? Really?

            The videos shown are deceptive. Sped up. It is intentional and because people would not sit and observe that long a video today.  I would guess you are watching 3 to 5 minuets in 1m 45s.  A ship of 95000 tons does not turn on a dime.

        Watching the collapse on y tube, it makes for a bit of metaphor. Happens very slowly, the ship approaches a pier, seems to collide, and nothing much happens. Then all of a sudden, boom, fall down! Gradually, slowly, then all at once. Or so we might think.

        “ Every manager in the system dreams the dream of that box of Cheerios arriving on the shelf just at the moment you decide to reach for it.”If I recall correctly, we first heard of this “just in time delivery” method from Japan.  It works there because of the close, patriarchal even, system of interconnected businesses.  Everyone has responsibility to everyone else for the end product.  It is “shameful” for one to fail the “family”, and conversely for the family members to fail to help one another.  This Oriental mindset cannot be replicated by Occidentals.  We try to replicate such an efficient system, but Western capitalism has too much dog eat dog, and too little reciprocal obligation outside of specified contract.  Hence such process becomes too brittle and subject to breakage.

            Maybe. Don’t underestimate the effect of being something around 1/10th the area. It’s one thing to have a logistics hub that serves a hundred miles. It’s another thing entirely when coastal production centers are a couple thousand miles apart.

                I believe it’s not the ship distance per se.  Hell, you can often fly essential parts in.  It’s a matter of priority for those you have relations with.  Quality, scheduling, priority in delivery, etc.
I’ve read that these companies, particularly the major ones help the smaller suppliers with both money and expertise if push comes to shove.  Just like you’d loan your cousin money if he asked, but not dump a dollar to a side walk beggar.

        This bridge can be quickly rebuilt.  Negroes are extraordinary steel workers.  Their concrete skills are the finest in the world.  Negro architects are surely at work at this moment designing new spans.  The young negro mayor of Baltimore is hard at work organizing the construction.
Most of the scrap metal from the old bridge will be quickly stolen by negroes.  This will help clear the river.  Negro gangs will quickly remove the metal and any valuables from the ship.
In a year you will see a new bridge entirely constructed by Baltimore negroes!

                With respect, I’m not certain that’s true.  You can look it up.  The bridge might well have held up, but was damage in the (improper) installation.  There’s a lot of writing on this fiasco and enough blame to go all around—twice!

        When the bridge named after the author of a nation’s national anthem collapses, that would be God telling that nation something.  Not to rule out mechanical and human factors, to be sure.  But it is a hint and I’m not guessing.
Kinda like when a nation’s national flag is ripped in half by the, er, wind.  Or when the presidential insignia unaccountably falls off the podium while the president is speaking (hi Barry!).  Or when two total eclipses bisect the nation with the space of seven years, junctioning at Little Egypt.  Dayum Barry even looks like some dead old fay-row.

        Steering is controlled by a HPU, once that goes down you lose steerage and rudder is locked to last position.  Power went out twice.  Back up genny will only power lighting/comms on a separate circuit.  Had just dropped tugs and bow thrusters wont operate above three knots (was going 8.5 at impact) 100k ton displacement so do the physics.  Likely tried to go full astern (from funnel smoke) but you also lose steerage when you do that.  No idea what tide, wind conditions were, but container ships are really prone to wind conditions.  This is from my kid who has done 4 refit/conversions on LNG ships in 300m range in last few years.  And a continuous truss bridge with little protection to the pier.  As with most engineering failures, multiple things piling up at the wrong time.

                There is a trade off between speed and maneuverability in ships that size. There was a considerable NE wind so once out of inner harbor may have chose a couple extra knots to make ship more responsive to helm.  I’ll have to ask the kid.

            Agreed mostly, except that true engineering failure is (or at least was) rare. What happens is that operating conditions differ from the design assumptions. In the case of I-35W in Minneapolis, the highway department specified the maximum weight that bridge would ever see. The bridge “failed” when subjected to weight way in excess of design. Well, duh.Similarly, as Zman said, this bridge was a quarter-century out of date. Had it been designed after the Tampa bridge failed under similar circumstances (1980?), the lessons learned there would have been factored in, the kinds of pylons and riprap used around the Tampa bridge trivial in terms of price relative to the costs of losing a bridge. But as Zman says, there’s no glory in pols spending money to prevent something like this that would probably never happen anyway.

            Meanwhile, after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake it took eight years to replace the collapsed section of the I-880 in West Oakland and twenty-four years to replace the eastern span of the Bay Bridge. The latter replacement was found to potentially have some structural weaknesses.
Then there’s the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, a rickety thing that’s reminiscent of the Key Bridge. It was retrofitted a few years ago but they should have just replaced the thing.

        Sclerotic government from the local to federal level is the absolute rule these days, unless of course it involves some sort of DIE initiative.  Fifty years ago in my city, the rapid growth was moving west and northwest.  However, to get to many of those places, you had to cross the busy SP railway.  Did our visionary city council look to the future and decide an overpass on the major artery in that area was needed?  Hell no.  Only after 45 years of increasingly large traffic jams did the job finally get done – of course to the massive inconvenience of the huge population that now live out that way.  There are just too many stupid people infesting politics (among other areas) these days.In a related aside, I watched a show last night on the history of Grand Hotel on Makinaw Island.  It is a substantial structure that was actually built in 90 days back in 1887.  Can you imagine anything like that in this day and age?  The old American, and male, “can do” spirit evaporated a long time ago…

        “…planners did not have to worry too much about ships smashing into bridges.”
Not entirely true. The Tower Bridge in London was specifically built to accommodate tall masted ships which is why it has a fixed public walkway over the traffic bridge which can be raised.

            Methinks you misinterpreted the comment. I believe the intent of that statement was that planners of 250 years ago did not have to worry that a ship smashing into a bridge would bring down the bridge. Back then ships were small and bridges were big.

        I believe the real meaning of this is as a metaphor for our society. Watching the video, it is clear that bridge was doomed well before the video begins. Massive disaster, impossible to stop, slowly, slowly making its way to the pylon. Then it’s gone in just a flash.
Lovely to see, for those with a certain approach to things.

        I work in an industry that has automated what were human functions. It works fantastic, until it doesn’t. When something goes wrong with the system it tends to cascade into a disaster that is difficult to correct in a timely manner.When i think of software driven robots producing stuff today i think of comparing our modern complex systems to a factory in 1941. That factory could produce cars one day but because of the flexibility of the humans on that assembly line could be producing tanks or planes in short order.Now today that factory and all its software driven machines would need modified and reprogrammed, an almost impossible task.Russians probably kept in place a less complex system and therefore its more easily modified or turned up or down in production.

            G-
I’d only add that there would also be a huge integration and test burden that would be incurred by those reprogrammed machines. You’d need to do weeks, possibly even months of those activities to ensure you had a line that wasn’t constantly dropping.
To me, it’s amazing how much inertia is created by all these incredibly complex automated systems.

            Remember those “accidents” in the Asian seas a few years ago? We contracted with terrorists to take out innocent Russian people. In my opinion it is highly likely that we should expect payback. Could Russians have simply jammed the navigation systems? I don’t pretend to know a lot about shipping but the timing seems to be suspicious.

            Oh man.  Think of what a hash are all those old legacy systems are, mixed with constantly updated Version 8.6 this and Version 14 that.With hardware conflicts and wiring problems (rats peeing on the cables, etc) on top of that.I met a couple electronics pro’s, who had crawled out from between the walls at a Rio Tinto mine factory.Two guys, one black, one white, so covered in dust, cobwebs, grease, and bug goo they looked like raccoons after they took took their goggles off.  They had learned electronics in the military and were doing maintenance on the factory electronics.I told ’em they were my heroes.  If only I had chosen another life, I would’ve been a tweenwaller.

You could swap out the obsolete farm equipment in Maryland for Rollin’ Greg Abbot putting on a show for the cameras down in Texas and it’s all exactly the same.

            To be fair to the scumbags (they don’t deserve being lumped in with politicians), this is a media driven country.  All politicians are just actors and entertainers at this point.  Been that way since, bare minimum Ike, and arguably since the advent of the radio star.

        Steve Sailer has decided to avoid the usual answers and instead go with an insane theory about bombs being squirrelled away on the ship.Holy Schnikes, but has that guy gone off the deep end!  I haven’t even read VDare in years because they let Sailer spam the site with so much COVID hysteria that it became literally impossible to find anything worth reading there between his 1384th and 1385th daily post on how COVID was going to kill us all.  Next up I guess – the 723rd article of the day on how lizard people are hiding bombs and mind-control rays in foreign shipping!  I have to speculate as to whether there’s some object lesson to be learned here about dissident-adjacent writers.

            Sailer is obviously declining mentally and his previous objectivity on issues has given way to more emotionally driven opinions (yesterday he declared the H-you-know-what-acaust as the most evil thing ever in history).Coincidentally, one of his loyal sycophants actually ventured out of the Sailer bubble and engaged Ron Unz briefly in the comments of another article.  Unz revealed that Sailer’s traffic has declined precipitously in the last 4 years, and this is no doubt correlated to Sailer’s disappointing (or plainly obtuse) opinions on Kovid, Ukraine,  his bizarre concern for feral negroes while at the same time ignoring the deliberate persecution and destruction of the white working class, as well as his sympathetic takes on individuals who clearly promote anti-white, anti-US policies, like Biden, Obama, LeBron James, Ketanji Jackson, Raj Chetty, etc. etc.  His most recent exercise in excuse making is for the Japanese sportsballer Sho Ohtani, who pretends to not speak Engrish in an effort to avoid answering tough questions about his apparent gambling problem and his interpreter engaging in all sorts of financial shenanigans.  But, Sailer loves Ohtani, compares him to Babe Ruth regularly, and most importantly, he’s a LA Dodger, and that means he is granted honorary diplomatic immunity.It’s the mindset of a young child, and it’s pretty sad.

            We just organized a terrorist act in Russia using the CIA created ISIS, so why would payback be so implausible? Could the navigation systems have gotten electronically jammed somehow?  I don’t know, but the timing makes me wonder.

                If there’s any payback from the Rooskies it’ll be the helluva lot more impressive than tumping over a flimsy bridge in Bawlmer. Like maybe Bawlmer just ceases to exist altogether.

                    I immediately thought of the Russians too. If this is payback for Moscow they’re probably just getting started. Someone else mentioned that they thought it was the Ukes being pissed off about their “aid” money getting held up in Congress. That’s the problem with the GAE though. When everyone in the neighborhood and all your relatives wanted you dead, solving your murder is complicated.

            Sailer did good work for a long time, but in this critical juncture, he’s decided to go small and focus on useless trivialities. I mean, FFS, he made a post about pretend Indians a few days ago – nobody cares about Liz Warren anymore, Steve! On the few posts where he does talk about the important things, the things he built his career and name on, he lets trolls and (self-identified) Jews hijack and misdirect the discussion away from the topic and towards more trivialities. I am not sure if it is because of age, he’s just tired, he feels like he put in the work, which is fine, but guys like Jared Taylor are still cooking.

                Perhaps he thinks the clampdown will be coming, will be brutal and epic on the lines of Rwanda, and wants to be “safe” and not sacrifice his family which depends upon him?
I cannot blame the man for that, if that is the case. All those young, unattached military age men recruited from South American prisons are not here by accident. They were deliberately brought here for a reason.

                    Oh, fuck yeah. That asshole was one of the chief reasons I stopped wasting my time at Steve’s blog.To Unz’s credit, he did offer the facility to “ignore this poster” ,which I never took advantage of because these prolific bastards such as Jack D were omnipresent, and deletion of their posts would chop up the continuity of a thread unmercifully. The only solution would seem to be to just flat out suspend their posting priviledges, and that would bever happen. Also, the more clever of these trolls played to Sailer’s vanities, particularly during the coof, when they would give Sailer unsolicited tongue baths.Bad money drives out good money.

            Except that’s not what Sailer is “going with”, if you click through to actually read the article.
He simply said don’t jump to conclusions about the cause but ended saying “So, I’d imagine the most likely cause is some catastrophic accidental failure on the ship leading it to drift into the tower.”
That’s a pretty far cry from going with the claim that it was a bomb squirrelled away onboard. Pretty disappointed in the Z Man over this one…

        Best comment I’ve seen so far is “tick tock, the clock has started as it took Russia only two months to fix the bridge going to Crimea”.
GAE would have to desperately squeeze every ounce of competence it has left to get the thing replaced at all, but I doubt they have it in them (someone ask Transportation Secretary Buttigig about it).

            For what it is worth, a major bridge in Philadelphia was fixed up in a couple months, way ahead of schedule, after it was damaged by, I believe, a tanker explosion. It is proof that they CAN be competent, even today, when they want to, but so often, they choose not to. Imagine the amount of wasted energy and resources that go into making this an intentionally dysfunctional and incompetent country, all focused towards elevating our worst and holding down our best.

                I don’t wish to discuss specifics but Big City A that I lived in has been debating changing out a major bridge for the entirety that I’ve been alive (and I’m not young), but when I moved to Big City B they needed a similar bridge replaced and it seemed like the thing was swapped out in a weekend (in actuality it was only little more than a year, but it was a huge project).  Interestingly the only difference between the two cities is that B has people actually interested in infrastructure, which is the exception not the rule (i.e. demographics was not the issue in ‘A’).

This was engineering by incompetents, and we’re going to live through hella more of engineering incompetency to come unless you’re killed by the fallen door of a commercial airliner. Then you just won’t live but the incompetency will continue for the rest of us. No standards, no accountability, no justice. You are here now.

                    We use Bhopal as a cautionary tale in engineering. It’s not that it was improperly designed, but rather that it was not built as designed. Specifically, instead of fail-close valves (they shut off flow if you lose power) the installers used fail-open. It’s why engineering firms now insist on having someone on-site overseeing the tradesmen who are doing the build.

                I have on a similarly sized ship and he’s correct.  If helm communication is lost then the steering gear can be manipulated on site manually by “trick wheel”. Rudder position indicators and true bearing indicators were at the station, in voice contact with the bridge.   In the total failure of electrical power to the steering hydraulic rams, they could moved by manual  pumps.  Which in my case meant four men rotating this thing until their lungs flew out, then replaced by four other men.  One team for each rudder and you’re moving an incredible amount of weight/force, each rudder unit had four 12” hydraulic rams.TLDR: Machinist Mate USN, stood aft steering watch when Noah still sailed.

        Infrastructure is the base of a society. A people on the rise seem to love building infrastructure. Heck, the Chinese seemed to have built way too much infrastructure. Sure, it’s wasteful, but you develop skills and capacity that, hopefully, can be used for useful projects down the line.A society that neglects infrastructure is obviously a society on the decline. The reasons vary, but the trajectory is clear.Z also makes a good point about GDP not exactly being measured correctly. The combined GDP of the US and EU is ~$40 trillion, compared to Russia’s $2.2 trillion. Supposedly, the US and EU have a combined economy that nearly 20X that of Russia.I don’t care what kind of military-industrial system Russia has in place. If Russia’s economy was truly 5% of the size of the US and EU, there would be no way that it could outproduce the West in any manufactured good that the West also produces – and we definitely produce military hardware. And if somehow Russia was outproducing in something; we should be able to quickly overtake them with a combined economy 20X the size.Sure, we’ve hollowed out our manufacturing, but Germany didn’t and we still produce a lot of stuff. No. The truth is that Russia’s economy isn’t 5% of the West. Russia’s economy is a lot bigger that what our metrics show and the West’s economy is a lot smaller.

        God, I remember in 1975 flying back home from Fort Benning to visit the folks in Sedona and reading about that bridge in a magazine I bought for plane ride. Don’t even remember the magazine name but it was some fluffy profile piece on Baltimore and the surrounding area. Things were certainly brighter back then, and that’s saying something relative to the mid-70s.

        One problem with the Key Bridge was that it had no dolphins (circular concrete structures that absorb ship impacts and protect the piers of the bridge). That was a tragic oversight considering the ship channel’s location and the amount of traffic that crosses it.The Sunshine Skyway in Florida, which was also hit by a freighter that had an engineering casualty and collapsed in 1980, was replaced by a new bridge with dolphins guarding all of the piers.Ships have mechanical and electrical casualties. It’s not a diversity issue, but as these container ships get larger, they are even more formidable battering rams.It seems like the more we complicate the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain.

                This failure to adapt to changing situations puts one in mind of The Grid. Taxed by the demands of massive server farms, the expectation that it will be able to handle charging mass numbers of electric vehicles, and all of these idiocies while shutting down power generation capacity that can respond quickly when the base load demand surges, and living in Cloud Cuckoo Land expecting solar and wind to rake up the slack? The disasters are predictable, and would be orders of magnitude more crippling in comparison to a localized, albeit serious, disruption to transit and commerce.

            I was also thinking about the Skyway this morning…that was the last major bridge disaster I think.Currently the Tampa-St. Pete area is building new bridges (added lanes) across the Bay. There’s certain states I trust for infrastructure improvements and Florida is one of them. (They also got the Brightline high-speed rail going without much fuss – compare that to California.) Can Maryland build a bridge in less than a year, like China can? We all know the answer to that.I suppose it’s one of those times to remind ourselves that there are good states and bad states to live in. This isn’t the “United States” as much as the “Discrepancy States”.

                Replacement of the Tappan Zee bridge literally took decades.  I was actually shocked when the new bridge got close to finished.  I had come to assume that the bridge and surrounding strip of 287 was just a permanent make-work project in NY.

            It is a diversity issue, though. Not that this specific thing was definitely caused by a DIE hire screwing up somewhere – though quite possibly, if you check our Maersk’s diversity page – but the fact that very complex systems require that the people who manage them are drawn from some pool with certain abilities on average.
If the Roman systems became too complex for other Whites to manage, what do you imagine is going to happen here?

                Looking at some pre-collision photos, there are some dolphins on the Key Bridge, but not as many as the Sunshine Skyway. Those cost about $120 million in today’s money, expensive, but a lot cheaper than buying a multi-billion bridge.
Also, some of those dolphins could’ve been used for mooring barges or possible navigation beacons.

                This is why I support welfare or UBI, at least above other options.  It’s the cheapest and least destructive way to hand out gibs.  Instead, we put these people in positions they cannot handle, which imposes a far larger cost on society than just their paycheck.
We cannot have a high IQ economy. Far too many people don’t have a high IQ.  We have to stop pretending that we can educate low IQ people and magically turn them into high IQ people. Giving someone a diploma doesn’t make them good at math like it does in the movies.

                    You are making the incorrect assumption that by giving them this UBI and welfare that they will be placated and that will be enough.  Nothing will ever be enough so this won’t prevent any of the things you think it will.

                        Further, UBI requires even more takings from those who produce to give to those who do not. That is not going to improve anything.
Cet par, productivity gains lowers prices, like used to happen from the beginning of the Agricultural Revolution and especially the Industrial Revolution, clear up until the creation of the Fed and other central bank scams, which were designed to skim off these productivity gains and hand them over to the finance guys. Get rid of that, and people really could live for less.

                        So what are we supposed to do with these people if we want to have a high IQ economy without anywhere near enough jobs for the lower half of the IQ curve?I absolutely do not support treating them poorly in any way.  IQ does not make the man.  There are plenty of high IQ people who are not fit to live in any moral society and plenty of low IQ people who live honorable and honest lives.BITD, we had an economy that allowed the lower 1/2 of society to live happy and productive lives.  This doesn’t really exist anymore, at least not enough to employ the vast majority of them.  Much of the employment which does exist does not pay well enough to survive without assistance.If you say ‘well, we have to have a real economy,’ sure, I agree with that.  But that state of affairs does not exist right now.  The armies of drug addicts, homeless, drug dealers and other criminals are what you get (more of) when you have an economy where large sections of the population are excluded.These people were not driven out of the economy by progress or technology, but by policy. Closing our factories and chasing low cost labor and lack of regulations across the globe enriching our so-called enemies, was deliberate policy. NAFTA was deliberate policy.  The special economic zones of China and later the entry of China into the WTO were deliberate policies.  We did this to them by choice, by slow deliberate action over decades of time. We sold them out for coin. Our leaders are EVIL.

                        @steveThe Fed, as bad as it is, is not responsible for most of the problem.  The free trade ideology is to blame.US workers cannot compete with foreign workers who have the same equipment, the same management etc.  Many of our factories that were closed down had all the equipment boxed up and sent to China. The same management team continued the manage everything.  When you can move production equipment and expertise around the world, you absolutely have no advantage no matter how advanced your economy is.We simply cannot compete with a country like China, or now Vietnam and India. They have much lower costs of living. They have much lower electricity. They have far fewer environmental and worker safety regulations.  They don’t enforce what little regulations they have.  This has held back their economy because they didn’t have Western expertise or production equipment.  But now they have OUR equipment. They have OUR management and finance too.  They have all the Western advantages plus all the third world low costs.Do you want these people to just die?   Just what do you want to do with the lower half of the former middle class?  Without manufacturing, there is little they can do that is productive enough to provide a wage that can support them.It’s amazing to me that people who claim to support White people and the fair treatment of these people throw them right under the bus when money is the issue.“Fixing” the money problem is not going to fix these other problems. In fact, it is likely to make everything worse, particularly in the short-medium term.

                        @Tars,So what are we supposed to do with these people if we want to have a high IQ economy without anywhere near enough jobs for the lower half of the IQ curve?1. Why would we want “jobs”? Apart from a shrinking number of people who wake up excited to get started on another day working, what’s the point? Haven’t you seen all those videos and memes of people who hate their jobs?2. Why would one fear not having enough low-IQ jobs, whatever that means. Lots of people hire out their lawn care, whether mowing or ChemLawn or whatever. Back when people had more disposable income, even middle class could afford a cleaning lady, or a maid, or maybe even a cook. Upper middle class could also afford a gardener, driver or pool boy, if desired.3. You can do whatever you like. I’m pretty sure I could find something for a few of them to do.UBI is a terrible idea. At least if they are out cleaning up the road ditches, they produce something of value. Why not put them to work doing things we are told American’s just won’t do, like growing their own food?

The free trade ideology is to blame.The free market has an airtight alibi — it wasn’t anywhere to be found.US workers cannot compete with foreign workers who have the same equipment, the same management etc.Time was when we didn’t have to. Being in a relatively free society, with a stable regulatory scheme, a legal system which, if not exactly fair, was at least more or less predictable, and an economic model where rags to riches stories were not uncommon made America the destination of choice.In a lot of respects, it’s that success that puts us in the situation we are now. We became rich, and people all around the globe want to be here just for that. Then someone gets the brilliant idea to sweeten the pot with free housing, free cash cards, welfare, and now UBI?

        Another way of viewing our national debt situation is to have an honest accounting of underfunded infrastructure, deferred maintenance and obsolescence. I’d bet that everyone here can name a massive infrastructure problem near them that would take billions to fix. Amazingly, the Civil Engineer society says our infrastructure improved a little recently, with the ports (!!) leading the way. You can judge for yourself I suppose.https://www.waterwaysjournal.net/2021/03/05/asce-infrastructure-grade-improves-to-c-report-card/Between broken sewers/watermains and old bridges, tragic electric grids and potholed highways, we probably face trillions of unfunded and unreported liabilities. As the white guys who build/repair all this stuff retire (or get displaced by gov’t DEI initiatives), I would suggest it’s impossible that we can maintain our infrastructure without a massive privatization effort.

            Any privatization effort is going to have to include strict standards on time schedule completion and cost overruns. In Toronto, the public transit system bought new streetcars from Bombardier in Quebec and when delivery was delayed, massive fines were imposed, as per the contract.

                That’s because Bombardier was stupid.Waay long ago, when I was a naive sapling, we were completing a building for the department to move/grow into.Just before scheduled building completion date, the subcontractor for the communications aspect of the building was grossly behind his completion schedule.  Obviously, communications for a department such as ours was a show stopper for move in.  We took the subcontractor to task and informed him, we would be exercising the $300 per day penalty for failure to complete on schedule..*Within a day*, we were called by the campus police that a fire had broken out in the building and we should come over to help them assess the damage.  The fire started in a storeroom used to house components for the communications wiring and transmission equipment.  It was small fire and fire was quickly “detected” and put out.  The subcontractor stopped by later on and claimed ignorance as to the cause and then said none of the equipment could be used due to possibility of smoke damage and would need to be “recertified” by the manufacturer.So the end result was a force majeure exception to the contract penalties *and* extra cost added for the recertification!  That’s how you do it folks in America!

        The old quote comes to mind. Once upon a time the ships were made of wood and the men were made of iron; now the ships are iron and the men are wood. It’s just a variation on the old observation that “Tough times make tough men who make soft times, which makes soft men,” which is where the problems really come in. I never thought it would get to the point where times got so soft that the men started thinking they were women, but here we are.It’s crazy to think of it, but even with GPS and mastery of low earth orbit we still have more trouble navigating certain places, like Tierra del Fuego, than those using cruder instruments or even dead reckoning back in the day of iron men.The bridge story, though, shows why you really can’t accuse those of us who abstained from the vax for doing so. I’m not antivaccine any more than I’m anti-bridge or anti-airplane. I simply don’t trust the level of human capital involved in making our vaxxes, planes, or bridges enough to take the risk at this point. If I thought that the smart fraction had some oversight, or even any say in managing the dummies, I might have a little more trust. But they don’t. Most of the smart white guys have either dropped out, gone completely independent, or even been lured overseas by countries who will reward them for their hard work and don’t hate them for the color of their skin.I’m staying here, but I’m staying on the sidelines until the people who stole our toy break it completely. And this time when we fix it, they can’t play with it, or even look at it, for that matter.

            joey:  Precisely.  I’ve noted before that my husband and I no longer fly – and we both first flew in the early 1960s and spent a few decades traveling the world.  Now?  Between TSA, diverse passengers, and DEI in building, servicing, and flying the planes, we do not trust the modern transportation system and will not use it.We both drove over the Key Bridge multiple times in years past, and give no thought to what could go wrong – far more to the engineering skill that made such a bridge possible.  Now, we always consider possible choke points or catastrophic infrastructure or system failure.  I worry every time my husband must travel for work – it will be Chicago in a few months – and the crime and third-world population – not to mention that he cannot go armed – make me worry more.Our dirt/gravel road is better maintained than were the DFW paved roads (it helps that a neighbor half a mile down said road works for the city public works department) with far fewer potholes.  When the simple wood structure holding up our mailboxes out on the paved road was damaged by someone, another neighbor bought the wood, got his tools, and replaced it in a few hours.  No muss, no fuss – just doing what needs to be done, because that’s what White men do.We seriously considered moving to Europe a number of years ago – even started to collect the documents to get husband citizenship and passport – just for a ‘what if’ scenario.  But we dropped it because our sons, as legal adults, wouldn’t have been  automatically included in said citizenship, and their future is our major concern, not our own.Every day we are more grateful that we moved rural.  We know it’s merely a stopgap until it all comes crashing down, but it’s still so much better to live White for now.  And all my husband’s friends – who stuck with their government jobs and sent their kids to top-name colleges – remain confident that their government pensions, plus social security, plus private annuities, will keep them comfortable and safe from klown world for the next 25-35 years.Who knows?  They could be right, and we could end up being the suckers.  But we’ve chosen to bet differently, and are preparing for the disaster of a future we see coming, rather than the future we would have preferred.

                @3gI love that you’ve found happiness in your rural setting.  For my wife and I, our main thing is being around other Whites.  I have been paying less attention to the goings on because I was making my wife miserable, and I just can’t allow that.  Life is for living, so I am living to be happy regardless of the insanity going on all around me.  Yes – I still have bouts of rage, but I’ve surrounded myself with other Whites, I spend my time with mostly like minded folks and I try to focus on the many blessings I have.I hope you and your husband can enjoy your later years and that your sons find their way through the nightmare.

            “Tough times make tough men who make soft times, which makes soft men,”
There seems to be no escape from this cycle of history.  Men living in hard times want to make life easier for their descendants and make sacrifices.
If the good times finally arrive, the people invent disco and superhero movies, which can be a lot of fun, granted.  Eventually it always converges on sex with children, which is what we are seeing today.
Can we rise above Spenglarian cycles with awareness of the cycle?  I’m not aware of any example from history.

                One of the most interesting questions, if you can escape that cycle. There are no examples of escaping it because the West, more specifically America, was the last to peak and older  advanced civilizations like Europe,  India, China, Egypt, Mesopotamia etc, evidently did not. Europe has had at least two peaks, probably three (Greece, Rome and Renaissance to WW1). But the question is very fascinating. Like finding a cure for macro cancer or even aging

        It was probably an actual accident but you have to wonder how hard it is to hack the computer controlling the rudder from the bridge or the navigation system. Would they be encrypted? The FSB had 72 or so hrs to get their man in position if in fact it is payback for Crocus or a warning that patience is getting scarce in Moscow

                I don’t think it was Russia, sure they could and get away with it but I could see them doing something that wouldn’t kill innocent people. Say something like a tanker taking off from Andrews accidentally crashing into a large government building somewhere in that area.

        This collapse fits with two large narratives.First, America is falling apart.  Maybe it pushing efficiency too far.  Or falling IQ intersecting with complexity.  Or the DEI chickens coming home to roost. Or a combination of all three.Whatever,  this is just another in a series of failures of post modern tech that we just didn’t hear about much at all thirty years ago.   Back then, this would have been a major story and scandal.  Now it’s just another drip.Secondly, America’s economic measurements are completely broken. The gauges aren’t connected to the machine at all.  We’ve been talking about investing in infrastructure for at least twenty years.  With periodic surges of hundreds of billions of dollars.  Remember Obama’s shovel ready jobs in 2010?  The money is getting spent.  To no effect. The infrastructure continues to crumble.  We all know it will take at least a decade, maybe two, to get this bridge replaced.  A hundred years ago the golden gat bridge was built in half that time.   Another example of this os the HSR in CA. $50+bn spent already without a single mile of operable hsr.

            The Minneapolis bridge that collapsed over the Mississippi River in 2007 was rebuilt in 14 months.  That is a much shorter distance than this one and done in a city and time of great competence.  We would just be guessing to say any more than much longer than that.

                And I can counter that: Back when I lived in Silly-nois there was an old center pivot bridge at 135th St. in Romeoville, IL. The bridge spanned a shipping canal and was built in 1899. Because Com-Ed built a big coal fired power plant next to the canal, the old bridge had to pivot open to allow barges to pass at least five to ten times a day. So in 1990 Romeoville and the State of Illinois got together to replace the old pivot bridge and build a more modern, higher bridge to allow barges and tugboats to sail underneath.1990. Remember that.The new bridge opened in 1998. And was nowhere near as big, as long, nor as high as the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore. Oh, and they swung open, and eventually removed the old 135st street bridge, so for eight years there was no bridge over the canal at 135th street.And this is in a town that was mainly White people.

        I don’t know about it taking years to debate the rebuild.  Biden loves Baltimore and has some family history there.  He will mostly likely push to have the construction process started this summer with progress that is visible by Election Day.  He is going to view this as an opportunity to show he can get things done rather than an obvious sign a decay attached to the decline of a once great city that is now a third world dump.  The Minneapolis bridge that collapsed in 2007 took 14 months to rebuild, so there is no way they can have it open by the election, but Biden will not want nothing to have happened by then.I also expect a push to change the name, so it is no longer named after slave owner Francis Scott Key.  Harriet Tubman would be the obvious choice, but they may choose someone more obscure an overtly anti-white.  Maybe they will go with Ray Lewis as symbol of the seriousness of our age.

            The system is too sclerotic. The EPA studies will take years to complete. Then you have the issue of funding, which will take years to finalize. This all assumes the locals want to rebuilt the bridge. Powerful interests will want to bridge at another location. That was part of the problem ten years ago when they debated this topic.
They will clear the debris this summer, for sure. The bi=ridge may never be rebuilt.

                But isn’t the easier way just to rebuild it in the same place? If the bridge gets built – big if, though I think it will – There’s already easements/rights of way established. I wound think that our decreasing-IQ political class would not be able to navigate the legalities of a brand-new location. So dey jus’ puddit back wheres dey found it.
100% agree with Barnard. The Key Bridge is dead. Long live the Thurgood Marshall Bridge.

        While it is true that infrastructure suffers from neglect, the root of the problem is harder to ascertain.It may be that because bridges and roads are in the public sphere — a sphere that is notoriously inefficient — the quality simply isn’t there.Somehow, if the private sector could be brought on board in planning AND management, you’d be likely to see better results. But the public is leery about handing over the keys to the kingdom to impersonal corporations — their loyalty to their shareholders set in stone.In the end, a mixed private-public endeavor may be the way to go.

        One nitpick Z.  Steerage systems are mechanical/electrical, that’s engineering, not navigation.  But rest assured all the crew had masters degrees from the VahrahmShiva Technical Institute so the mundane, such as planned maintenance, was well looked after.Horatio Hornblower and Slocum himself could have been on the wheel but without electricity to move the rudder gear it was too late.

        “No doubt the usual suspects are working on a plot where Putin is responsible for the accident.”
Believe it or not, I have seen that suggestion at many places. The guy is so smart, he can crash bridges, hack elections, make Boeing doors fall off, cast spells on world leaders, but so incompetent that he cannot stop weirdos shooting around his town 🙂
I prefer to stick to rising incompetence. That is the most parsimonius explanation of things falling apart around this part of the world.

            I agree accident is the more likely but it is also the answer suggested by normalcy bias. A major port, especially suited apparently for importing cars, would presumably also be perfect for shipping out heavy military gear like tanks and artillery. Just a thought. I’d say 2:1 accident over sabotage

                Granted, this was a while ago, but I had a friend, since passed, who was a Delaware River pilot out of Lewes , DE. Their organization was a coop- the members of which had a vested interest in the competency of the pilots. He also, and I could be wrong, gave me the impression that they were immune from political pressures.

            As someone who once navigated ships, I can tell you for certain that the Harbor Pilots I dealt with were always the ultimate professionals. It is one of the most coveted jobs in the maritime world and nearly impossible to get. You have to have your unlimited tonnage license, many years of experience on all sorts of vessels, and (like our host said) know that harbor, its currents, tides, etc, like no other person on earth. You also needs the brass balls to be able to get on and off a moving ship in some crappy weather.I will always have the utmost respect for those people.
