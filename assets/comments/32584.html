        Actually, we may have an answer to our dilemma: Eastern Orthodoxy. Many in the West, and I know some of them, have turned to Orthodoxy. This version of Christianity maintains its masculine virility by excluding the feminine in its priestly hierarchy, yet allowing its priests to marry (or chase skirts). It also embraces nationalism, which gives substance to patriarchical impulses. It is obvious that Russia has been revivified by its long dormant religious heritage. Watch what happens in the east.

            True, although ‘Christian Identity’ is a more accurate framework for understanding the covenants God made exclusively with Israel (not jews) and apply to both OT and NT.https://christogenea.org/articles/what-christian-identity“Christian Identity, also sometimes called Israel Identity, is the only true conservative Christianity. It is true because it seeks to maintain the understanding – in accordance with Scripture – that the New Covenant was made only with those same people with whom the Old Covenant was made: the House (family) of Israel and the House (family) of Judah. These Israelite people are traceable through time to the Keltic and Germanic tribes of today. None of these people are Jews. The Jews are descended from a mere remnant of the old Kingdom of Judah along with assorted Edomite and other Arabs who were mixed into the Roman province of Judaea during the Hellenic period.Christian Identity is the belief that the Covenants of God are real and consistent. It professes that the people of the Old Testament were every bit as much Christian as the people of the New Testament. They were simply looking forward to the first advent of the Christ, while we today await His Second Advent. As the famous Christian bishop Ignatius said nineteen hundred years ago, Christianity did not come from Judaism: rather, Judaism is a perversion of Christianity. Christian Identity is therefore the original Christian Orthodoxy, and Christian Identity is the original catholic faith, in the true and original use of the word “catholic” by Christian writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.”

                Thank you, Yorgensen, that rings the bell of truth for me, a born and forever “atheist”.
Why? Because race is the root, my race is my religion.
People, even the religious, seem to think that race is a random accident, with little meaning. I say no, race is integral to the Design, a pure expression of what the ecology that people call the “spiritual” is working towards. Of why life exists.
I also say the Israelites were majority Aryan- that is, white- as was the Nazarene, a banner I could readily pledge to.

                    The race-is-religion thing is worse off than Protestantism and will always break off into rival and quarreling sects.No group of people will EVER be satisfied with a singular definition of race, and that is always going to be the crux of the problem and source of discord.For me personally, the concept strains credulity.  As an example, all whites are part of your family, yet in the real world tell that to a parent or a sibling or a spouse that some strangers across the world are just as much “my people” as you my wife, or my son, etc.  That is never going to fly in the real world.  And imagine your own kid coming home saying he is running off with “his people” and you tell him “I am your people” and he says, nope, talk to the DNA papa.  Race is my religion.  They’re are just as much “my people” as you!!!I don’t know but good luck.

                        There is a difference between nuclear family and extended family. Nobody’s saying Tsvetan the Bulgarian truck driver should be as important to Sigurd the Icelandic fisherman as his own son. But he should dam’ sure count for more than some African savage his treasonous government imported.

                            Well there we go, Ostei, because there is always going to be dissension in the ranks.  The point you bring up is just another bone of contention.  Why the concept is a dead-end.  For every five “realistic” guys who accept a hierarchy of “my people” based on genetic proximity, there is going to be one purist who insists that ALL whites must be considered just a much family as your mom and dad.Philosophically, perhaps, or taking the white-is-my-religon to its logical outcome, that purist may be right.Or better yet, explain how “race is my religion” finds expression in the real world?  I guess it means if you see a white guy on the side of the road with a flat tire, you are compelled to help him without question?  Is that just one example?  If not, what are some of the ways this religion works in the real world?

                                The other problem is the majority of shitlibs are white. If you have to rule out half the demographic right out of the gate, maybe try to find some more common factor to base your new religion on?

                                    The white race is fallen. But unlike every other race on the planet, it does still have the capacity to rise to empyrean heights. And if this means separating from the race traitors, so be it. I have no use for them, and whatever horrible fate befalls them is no concern of mine.

                                I’ve encountered no such purists. Not even on-line. And as for the intersection of race and religion, Christianity, in its militant, non-feminized form, serves as a pretty good proxy for whiteness as religion. Sure, sure, there are plenty of black and brown Christians, but deep down inside everybody knows it’s the white man’s religion, which is why the Left has targeted it for destruction.

                        “No group of people will EVER be satisfied with a singular definition of race, and that is always going to be the crux of the problem and source of discord.”
No system is without problems.
Our enemies will determine who is white and who is not.
As it becomes more clear to whites that they are becoming a hated minority, whites will be forced together.

                    For most of my life as an Irish/German/Norwegian descendant living in Amerika I wondered why Christianity only spread like wildfire amongst fellow Europeans. No denominational “universalist” church could ever explain to me why Paul, Luke et al. went straight to the cities and towns in Europe/Asia Minor where their fellow racial Israelites where living rather than to Africa, India, China etc. I started thinking maybe Christianity had something to do with race (Matthew 15:24)When I eventually encountered a few ACTUAL Christians (less than 5% of Christians in Amerika) who knew about the Assyrian and Babylonian deportations I was shocked I’d never learned any of this including the covenants with the House of Israel and House of Judah (Jeremiah 31:31 and Hebrews 8:8), the true definition of “Jew” and “Gentile” and why the majority of Israelites (not jews) were living in Europe by the time of Jesushttps://archive.org/details/identifying-biblical-israel-today-e-book/mode/2up

                        Are the Jews today the descendants of the O.T. Israelites? No. Modern day Jews are mostly the descendants of Punic converts to a form of the Judean Yahweh cult after the fall of Carthage.The Punic hypothesis is consistent with the genetic data (Phoenicians and Judeans were genetic cousins), and helps explain why large numbers of ‘Jews’ are suddenly found throughout the urban centers of the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus (with large numbers in Spain and North Africa). It also explains why a nation of peasant farmers with no real history of sea-faring, commercial trading, or colony founding, suddenly turn up engaged in successful commerce all over the Mediterranean.The theory was first proposed by H.G. Wells in his Outline of History, but seems to have gone unnoticed.Lawrence Blanchard’s book looks interesting. Thanks for recommending it.

                            Excellent insights ! I’ve read many accounts that the “Phoenicians” were Israelites early on but through their maritime empire mixed with other races like Canaanites et al. They would never have referred to themselves Phoenician as such but rather as Sidonians or Tyreians.One thing that puzzled me for many years was the misunderstanding of the differences between the term “jew” and Israelites. The idiosyncrasies in all english Bible translations require any serious Christian to study the Greek NT, the Nestle-Aland is combined of all known codices including the uncials, Vatincanus/Sinaticus and Papyri..The correct understanding of ‘ethnos’ (Gentile) and ‘Ioudaois’ (Judean) converts more judeo-christians to Christianity than anything else !https://archive.org/details/originofthewordjew2/mode/2up?view=theater

            Yes, but it’s p clear the alt-right (as a psyop) pushes Orthodox as a means to further polarize this side. Unless you think Cernovich is serious when posting about it.
That’s what this post is about today by Z…one side is manly, the other is womanly. Polarizing the masses makes them easier to control. Forget you have to ignore what Jesus said to make this high school level writing work.

                Would you extend a bit? I’m as prone to slander as the next guy, but what specific high school level writing are you talking about. (You might have to dumb it down for me — I have at best a grade-school understanding of EO.)

                    Son’s sole purpose in posting to this group seems to be criticism of Z-man.  It used to be principled and to the topic at hand, but now seems to be mostly ad hominem attacks which reflect less upon Z-man than himself.   I suppose it’s to be expected.  There’s one in every group that seeks to aggrandize himself by putting down the host.  Pathetic.

I generally think you’re a smart guy, Compsci. I often look forward to your comments. However, if you think pointing out that Z’s argument today is founded on polarizing both sides to accept what appears to be an agenda is some sort of ad hom, Idk what to tell you.

                            You only support one side of your comment. The other part, “…this high school level writing work.” is conveniently overlooked—and certainly unnecessary to state your disagreement. Hence the (deserved) retort.I’ve sensed this in other comments of yours. Z-man, more than his opinion/ideas, seems attacked. I simply stated the appropriate name for this fallacious style of argumentation.Z-man can certainly take care of himself in these matters, and perhaps should wrt some commenters who have become little more than disruptive trolls.Yesterday’s commentary and today’s seem to be showing that Z-man is not always supported in his opinion and is indeed deserving of “correction” by his audience. It just appears to me that when one is a guest in another’s house, a bit more etiquette might be shown to the host.

                                It’s absurd to say I have an obligation to support multiple sides of my argument.What you’ve labelled as “ad hom” shows your misunderstanding of debate and logic…I did not say what he said was untrue because of how it’s written. I pointed out its rhetorical purpose and then implied, imho, that he reasons like a high schooler. This makes what I said just a mean thing to say, not a fallacy.I’ll admit I’m having a shitty few months and feeling very jaded with everyone around me. People suck in clown world, especially if you want to get anything done. Not a big deal but given Z’s recent nasty rudeness when I said we can’t know if he’s controlled op (cause for fuck’s sake, we can’t), I’m probably more nippy than usual. I’ll try to dial it back.

                    I can’t tell if you’re joking but that’s what I think Z is here to do along with the alt-right, gin up support for this. Slide us slowly toward accepting a technocratic police state. As a real longtime dissident, I’m not saying I’m against it, although I’m skeptical we don’t have other choices.Still every conservative I knew turned on us during precious covid time because we wouldn’t mask. The technocrats did too though. So did the libs. I see no indication there are any friends on any sides, so what’s a religious guy with a family supposed to do?I’m fine accepting the inevitable but I need to see an opt out for my kids when it comes to police state tracking, tranny homo-ness, slutness, censorship, etc. Then I’ll sell you all out the same you will (or have already done) to me.Come Daddy Thiel and Mama Musk!

            My parish was pretty well attended on Sunday, for the “Feast of the Dormition.” The trouble with Orthodoxy, especially in an ethnic parish, is the liturgy and the ritual. It doesn’t connect with me that much, but that’s who I am.. Protestants do a better job teaching and explaining, making the service more interesting.

                    Lol I’d wager, even today, most Protestants either don’t attend a megachurch, or, like me, are so Protestant they don’t attend at all.
(Not that that’s a good thing, but it beats rainbow flags. Probably a big part of why Protestantism is apparently collapsing— it’s becoming invisible, especially behind the circus. But I’d also wager it isn’t ackshully going away.)

                I agree with Tempo. I admire the beauty of Orthodoxy, but it’s a religion for a different time. It’s seriously stuck in the past, but some people like that, and God bless them. But I do like to hear pastors connecting scripture with modern issues. Some Orthodox priests try and do that, but clearly their training is: keep it 2,000 years old.

                    Yep. What I admire about Orthodoxy is that they don’t get into hot button political issues that much, except maybe in a patriotic way when it comes to the motherland. Probably not as noticeable in the old country, but very noticeable here when you compare it to other denominations. Orthodoxy is not like some Catholic parishes in the past where you would walk in and you’d see a bunch of peace banners and all the abortion politicking. They just stick to the word of God. That’s great and I appreciate it, but for me it’s an hour and a half of boredom.Family members were carping that I was playing on my phone on Sunday during the service. I was actually trying to follow the liturgy.

                    I will add that I don’t really care about the religious gobbledygook that much. To me, Orthodoxy is about the lifestyle. It becomes internalized. It’s almost a way of life. I don’t know how much the church has to do with that except as maybe a backdrop or a foundation for all that, but that’s what I like most about it. They are just certain things you do and certain ways you act and it seems to carry through to the younger generations as well.At church you gather with a bunch of like-minded people who tend to be of society’s nicer half. Nice families, nice kids. It’s kind of a breath of fresh air compared to what you experience out in the real world.

                    Trying to keep up is one of the things that made Christianity irrelevant from the mid 20th century onward.  One cannot be topical without being captured by it.  Not a single Western denomination has survived the 20th century, though some individual churches have.
For all the criticism of Evangelicals and their Christian rock (and rap) and all the empty feel-goods, they are doing exactly that, destroying themselves by getting with the times.
If you want to reach people where they are, you’re not a religion, you’re a social club.

                You’re not supposed to “connect” with it.  The Catholic Church only did mass in Latin until fairly recently.  Until fairly recently and for many centuries, Catholics went to mass and didn’t understand a word of it.

                    Bill Buckley lamented the introduction of the vernacular Mass because he felt that the inaccessibility of Latin to most parishoners forced them to focus on the mystery of the liturgy.  I’m not sure I buy that but it’s an interesting theory and certainly church attendance post Vatican II doesn’t offer a good counter argument.

                    I’ve only been to mass three times, a wedding, a funeral and once I was invited to experience a Latin Mass. The congregants are observers, watching the priest’s back most of the time. The priest is addressing Jesus, not worshiping the crowd. Even the homily had the priest facing the “wrong” way, which, I was told later, was to avoid the possibility of anyone getting the impression the message was directed at anyone in particular.
Jesus is the point. I can get behind that. At least the idea of it.

                    I imagine ‘Christendom’ came into use because, by that time, it’s all the people had in common. If things hadn’t come apart, we’d probably be calling ourselves Romans, instead of Christians, or Westerners.

                Judeo-Puritanism is a state of mind, not a religion. There is no “there” there. It can’t even maintain the civilization of which it is a part. Without an historical/cultural/ethnic foundation, “religion” becomes rootless and emotional. Put yourself in the mind of someone like John Brown. That is your true believer Baptist (or any other of its numerous Calvinist offshoots).

        Starting a new religion is a little above all of our paygrades. In the end we get a cult of some type anyways. Rebuild what’s already here, how I don’t have a clue. Eastern or traditional latin mass for a start.
face it though, without extreme hardship there will be very few takers. That said, hardship is coming.

                    No, it’s becoming a norm no thanks to the powers in charge. My point is generally speaking, European churches are becoming museums. Maybe not so much in Catholic regions, but in northern Europe (Germany) I can assure you most churches are empty on Sunday but for a few of the older faithful.

        One thing I’ve noticed in the Catholic Church is despite having an anti-pope Bergoglio ruling from Vatican City, there is a rebellion starting to materialize at the parish level. Bergoglio (I refuse to call him Francis or pope) has tried to eliminate the Latin Rite for Mass, which I think he knows brings people to Christ. Since he is, to paraphrase St. Paul, working for his father the Devil, he loathes it with demonic hatred.Some parishes have decided to go against the so-called pontiff’s decree and continue with the old, pre-Vatican II rite. I love the Latin Mass. It is literal communion with God, unlike the Norvus Ordo rite that is too Protestant-like for my tastes.Also, the new batch of seminarians that are replacing the more left-leaning Boomer priests are extremely conservative when it comes to church doctrine. We had a young priest take up resident at our parish and his homilies are pure fire. I won’t say he’s one of us, but he definitely doesn’t back down from calling out evil.The Church will prevail in the end, but it needs to cast off the trappings of this evil age and go back to its roots. Happy-clappy, rock-band Jesus bullshit that is heavily feminized won’t get it done.

            “Happy-clappy, rock-band Jesus bullshit that is heavily feminized won’t get it done.”I don’t know about that. I think that’s just the fuddy-duddy in most of us. I doubt David performed the Psalms as funeral dirges (except for the ones that basically are, of course) or as Gregorian chants.Like all human organizations, I think the church ended up taking itself too seriously.Now I get the sense of awe that the edifice and the Golden Ratio reverb instill, and maybe that’s a key element in some people’s belief. (Who am I kidding? Most peoples’.) I just need more of an appeal to the rational spirit He gave me.

                To this day I retain an open mind about “christian rock.” But I still haven’t heard any that’s worth a squirt of piss. I’ve got nothing against wailing guitars, the problem is that those I’ve heard in religious settings have invariably been second rate. And Neil Young is bad enough on his own without somebody trying to emulate him from the pulpit.

                    Yeah, electric guitars are pretty tough to make sound appropriate, but I’m sure people thought the same when Silent Night made its debut accompanied on an acoustic.
Maybe I’m an old fuddy-duddy, but it’s hard for me to get behind any of the Christian Rock. It just doesn’t get me in a worshipful attitude. There is some much more mellow stuff that works, though.

                    The only good Christian rock is music that is rock first and Christian second. Examples: “Jesus Just Left Chicago” by ZZ Top, “Jesus Is Just Alright” by the Doobie Brothers, “Spirit in the Sky” by (((Norman Greenbaum))), and “Put Your Hand in the Hand” by Ocean.

                        The best Christian rock is the music that doesn’t know it is Christian rock – like U2’s “Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking for” or whatever the title is.  Half the time, the artist doesn’t even know he is making Christian music and/or doesn’t intend to, the theme just comes through.  Same with film.  It’s like almost by accident (or byproduct). Or you could even say “co-opted” by the listener.

Quite. The mainstream Catholic news magazines don’t seem to know how to approach the growing phenomenon of firebrand young traditionalist priests who basically have no use for the current crop of bishops and their left-liberal pieties.

            Bergoglio was a “red diaper baby” — his parents were communists, he was raised as a communist, he still believes in that, not in the Church. I’m not even a believer and I consider him an infiltrator from the enemy (be that the socialist left or the antichrist) whose goal is to tear down this pillar of Western civilization.

                    Yes that is the rub
If the Jew goes bye bye there is much less pertinence for Christianity
If that is the price of being free of the Jew, is it worth it?
But also maybe not, because people like me who lean spiritual will always find something meaningful in Christianity, and in fact I’d enjoy my religion much more if I didn’t ever have to even think about the Jews and their shitty ways

            Right. You cannot engineer a religion, the way you engineer a bridge. This is the problem of intellectual people and the root of all our problems. The progressive managerial elite think they can create a design on paper and then, the world will work that way. We have seen how this works. The Law of Unintended Consequences and the gods of the Copybook headings make the implementation a living mess.Religions work like markets. A prophet (Smith, Mohammed) or a scholar (Luther) arises and people follow him or don’t. For each million prophets, only a handful are successful and it takes a lot of time to be successful. In the Internet, each blogger wants to create each own religion and only gathers a handful of followers. Even more successful movements can fail.  What about Shabbetai Zevi, a seventeenth-century Jew that created a mass movement who believed he was the Messiah? Nobody remembers him after the Sultan threatened him to death and he converted to Islam. Smith was successful but he didn’t conquer all the Western civilization, remaining a minority.You can read Christianity in a masculine way. Christ is a hero, who sacrifices for the people and has to suffer and die and then conquers, Christus Victor (this is a masculine paradigm not a feminine one). In multiple times, Christian males have been called to be soldiers of Christ, protecting their communities and conquering other people for the faith. This is also a masculine paradigm. Western conquests were done under the flag of Christ until recently.However, it is clear that today’s Western Christianity is emasculated. This has deep roots starting in the 12th century and has accelerated recently. You can consult “The Church Impotent: The Feminization of Christianity”, which you can read free on the Internet, for more details.This has not affected Eastern Christianity because the Great Schism was before the 12th century. This is why Eastern Christianity has retained his masculine character. We can learn a thing or two from our Eastern brothers.Whatever you think, we are stuck with Christianity. Any religion developed right now would take centuries to conquer the Western world and we will be toast by them. We can adopt Islam or Buddhism, but this is renouncing our Western heritage, not only because of worshiping foreign gods, but also because these religions have ways of thinking that are very different to the Western way of thinking.At the end of the day, I don’t think religion is a problem. Decadence is. Roman people had a pagan masculine religion and they abandoned it when they got wealthy, adopting all kinds of feminized and selfish thinking. Any religion that demands sacrifices from people will be rejected by the modern man, who only accepts religions that support his selfishness, accelerating the decadence.The West has run its course, that’s all. You cannot fight against the forces of history by trying clever schemes like inventing a new religion. Read Glubb for more detail. Our efforts should be to slow the decadence and to protect our loved ones. Anything else is a pie in the sky.

                An examination of failed religions would likely be more valuable to us than looking to the established demoninations for inspiration.

        In its social role, the Church has supported fidelity, fecundity, and solidarity, all necessary for a healthy society and all loathed by our current elite. Too many Christians think they can live double lives, going along with the modern liberal ideology (a suicide cult) while continuing to live a private Christian life. Lie down with dogs and you’ll wake up with fleas.

            Atheism is for dullards anyway.
anyone who can’t at least be mystified and awed by the world around them and how we got here and what we’re doing here and why we’ve been given a soul, they’re never worth listening to anyway.
And you have to be a complete bonehead to totally buy into the concept that this all began with a bang and then consider the case shut and closed.

The point is not that it’s true – the point is its religious implications: transhumanism and evolution into gods, basically Satanism and rebellion against God.So the masses continue to parrot debunked Darwinism like COVID vaxx sheep, while the initiates know what it’s really about…

                    No, I am using atheism in the correct sense, a belief that no God exists.
If no God exists then it means things just came into being — for reasons.  Anyone who buys into that lacks imagination, curiosity, and brainpower.  I.e. is a dullard.

        I used to think my dad was a bit off because it seemed he went out of his way to make life harder than it needed to be.  Looking back however I see it was his Catholic and cultural upbringing where suffering was needed to make and keep a man strong.  Like resistance exercises strengthen muscles, having something pushing back on you keeps the soul strong or whatever you want to define it as.  Some suffering or hardship in other words keeps a man strong.this concept is anathema to people today.  Where people are trained and taught to avoid hardship at all costs.  Hence they become weak.  Prosperity is also a weapon in this way.   Whoever thought they would find a way to turn prosperity against us, but they did.  But in reality this was probably always the case.I think the Catholic Church knows this and has always known it.  Which is why money was seen as the root of all, evil.   That is also something of a coded language becaus money equates to prosperity which equates to letting yourself become weak which equates to a flock with no hardiness to meet the demands of life.   We are seeing this all around us now I believe.  And then we had someone like rush Limbaugh always preaching how prosperity was great and we all needed to pursue our dreams and so forth as if that would make the problems go away.  They never do and especially never did for him.  But he was a strange man, but all of these prosperity pimps are

            “Which is why money was seen as the root of all, evil.”
The passage is, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” It’s not the money itself, but forming money into some kind of god, and putting that before Him.
The church quite hypocritically did not scorn money. Look around the Vatican, or, hell, any Catholic cathedral.
﻿The Mormon reference reminded me of one of my favorite spaghetti westerns, They Call Me Trinity, and that calls to mind what the Major said of the Mormon encampment — “quite a lucrative poverty.”

                I get all that, but the Church teaching was that life was about suffering.
And I think the Church took the idea of money being the root of all evil a step further and emphasized the idea of a leisurely life without worry or stress as un-Godly. And it is, and it is also anti-life because life requires ebb and flow.
The Vatican hovered up all of the money for very good reasons, not because it was enamored with riches.

                    But His message was not primarily about suffering. The truth is somewhere between that and the “Prosperity Gospel” — “I come that they might have life, and they might have it more abundantly.” “He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He restoreth my soul.” Etc.
If the Vatican hoovered up money for good reasons, what did they do with it? Why spend it on gilding every room of the Vatican instead of good works? Why is it that there are fantastic cathedrals in their names, but He didn’t even fund raise to repair the ceiling in the temple?

        There is a new religion. It’s called Christianity and is found in the Holy Roman Church dictated by Christ on the cross who rose from the dead. How do you kill someone who defeated death itself?
Perhaps if we stop obsessing over decline and actually learned about this faith, attended the masses full of young families, understood the church doctors and the sacraments we’d have a better picture.

                            If you like, I’ll retract the premise that Jesus wasn’t infected or tainted with OOS. This would be a very strange situation though, don’t you think? It means that the allegedly perfect god made a human, Jesus of Nazareth, with the deadly taint even though the god’s alleged omnipotence implies it didn’t have to. (Is there an immutable law of existence which requires OOS?)Recall that the god, supposedly a trinity, unified itself with the human in a condition called a hypostatic union. So the allegedly perfect god became one with sin and, as such, was no longer quite so perfect. Establishment of the hypostatic union implies that the alleged trinitycanchange even though we are told that it can’t.Chuch doubletalk about sin and salvation needs to be explained better by its human authors, and while they’re at it, let them explain something else, too. Can the trinity break the hypostatic union after it’s been established? If not, why say that the trinity is really sovereign over humanity and that humans aren’t necessary beings? If so, why allow the cleansing and perfection of the trinity to be dependent upon the deeds of humans such as Pilate and members of the Sanhedrin?

That’s what I meant earlier. This has absolutely nothing to do with what was said. One gets to the end of your drivel and finds himself stupider than when he started.
Look at me. Try to understand. A reply is supposed to be at least tangentially related to the topic. A new topic, like your objection to the hypostatic union hypothesis, should be exactly that, a new topic.

                        (and Catholic Church does not teach that)That’s an expedient omission from the “deposit”. There’s no salvation outside the Church, say traditionalist shamans, but no embryo, fetus, or babbling infant ever believed in the so-called savior. An awkward conclusion entailed by these premises is so obvious that you need to be a conniver, an imbecile, a young child, a babe, a fetus, or an embryo to remain ignorant of it.Now, Jesus is supposed to be fully human, and we can presume that fully human Jesus didn’t need any “plan” of salvation to be cured of “original sin”, for he wasn’t infected withoriginatedoriginal sin. So let’s draw another awkward conclusion about the deposit of faith. It brings us back to the premises that Jesus must die like some sort of sacrificial animal and that a human must belong to the Church.

        The problem with Mormonism is that it is absurd.  Joseph Smith was a charlatan, and if someone arose today making the claims he did almost two centuries ago, I doubt he would get much traction.  Starting a new religion is easy, but getting large numbers of people to actually believe it is difficult, especially at a time when it is much easier to verify or discredit claims made by would-be prophets.  Ideally, you want people to believe a new religion so fully that they are willing to die for it…but I doubt there are even many Christians today who would actually be willing to die for their faith.  This is a fundamental problem, because people who actually believe in a religion and take it seriously are much more willing to go to great lengths to defend their cause.

                    My uncle went Scientology.  But this was only because he fell in love with a married woman who was part of it and who’d told him she would be divorcing her husband for him.  But it was taking time.  And he would have to prove himself.  And proving himself meant giving the church $50,000 he was waiting on from a movie deal and when $50,000 meant something.  I was there living with him when she came through the apartment gate with a man in a black suit, and me and my friends were watching from the pool, but I did go back into the apartment for a drink and saw them all sitting on the couch with her pretty hands on my uncle’s knee.  Softly pleading.  I remember my uncle’s expression, because he was the cheapest guy I’ve ever known, but it was all giggles after the check was signed.  Then she and the man in the suit left, and she later dropped my uncle, and she never divorced her husband, who was also in scientology.

                I actually thought of Scientology when writing my post, but there are two crucial differences between Scientology and Mormonism.  First, Mormonism has approximately 17 million followers worldwide today.  The last time I checked, I think there were only about 50,000 Scientologists left.  Scientology got a lot of press about 20 years ago, but it never got close tohaving the same level of powerand influence as Mormonism.  That brings me to my second point, which is that a new religious movement needs to be able to survive more than a generation in order to have a chance at becoming established.  Part of the reason Scientology has died out is because all of the secret knowledge members had to pay tens of thousands of dollars to obtain was published on the Internet in the early 2000s, making it available to anyone interested for free.  Another reason is that it is even more ridiculous than Mormonism.  If you’re unfamiliar with the cosmology behind Scientology (and want a good laugh), do an internet search for Xenu and thetans.

                    I do not disagree about Scientology, but it is a proof of concept. That concept being that a small, dedicated group of believers can exert extraordinary influence. One of the things that would be necessary for a new religion that addresses the suffering of this age is that it would have to abandon the universalist priors of Christianity.

                        Scientology is the mechanism of the ancient Mystery Religions stripped of all references to the supernatural. Hubbard was a Satanic occultist, utterly amoral and predatory.
The methods used to grow Scientology had nothing to do with proselytizing or persuasion.
The proof part may be accurate, but I believe you’ve gotten ahold of the wrong concept.

            I hate to say it but all religions are absurd, and probably man-made. I have been reading Alan Watts lately and his views resonate with me. I think all religions have a poor grasp of the Divine, but we Humans can only partially understand something that is way beyond our comprehension. From Animists to Scientologists, we are believing creatures for a reason, but how we get there is in a fumbling, human way until we die and then we’ll know.
Go ahead and call me a Deist or a Unitarian Universalist.

                        When the elder Bush was getting ready to make Kuwait safe for Exxon, and rescue all of those babies from the cold concrete floor, a customer of mine who was a UU minister told me his flock was traveling by bus to DC for a big march. I decided to go with them. It was a worthy cause, so I’m glad I went. However, spending several hours on the bus down and back with that bunch of smarmy, self righteous creeps was quite the eye opener.

                    Unitarianism isn’t a religion, it’s a subscription for generic clerical services in case someone needs to be married or buried. There aren’t any beliefs or observances required. It’s grace on the cheap, basically promising something for nothing, which is why it attracts so many liberals. It’s pretty much a spiritual welfare program.

                Watching a recent true life disasters tv program, in almost every instance, the folks in the scenario desperately entreated some form of deity to intercede and save them, and in almost every case, they were convinced beyond doubt that this is why they survived, and this was among peoples who apparently practiced no religion. Perhaps there is a subconscious need to believe in a higher power?

                I think religions evolve to become absurd. Of those that weren’t intended as jokes in the first place, early Middle Age Catholicism is the only outlier that comes to mind.
Lots of religions had an equivalent of Persephone. And when planetary motion was unknown, it was as good an explanation for seasons as any. The Catholics established colleges to study this new thing, “science”, and threw a fair bit of coin that way, and incorporated it into their doctrines and dogma as well as they could.
As pointed out in the essay, modern religion effeminized and primitivised, and became absurd.

                My mother was completely beside herself when I used to say that all religions to me are basically the same. It’s like I had committed the worst blasphemy. But, at the end of the day, they are. My cousin had a pretty good way of looking at things. He calls them all franchises. Burger King, Wendy’s, McDonald’s.Basically all religions are all trying to find a way to describe how we all fit into the grand scheme of things. I think there’s something to it, even if nobody can possibly nail down the specifics. I mean, somebody had to create us and had to create this place. Somebody has to teach you the keys to living a successful life.Orthodoxy has a good way of explaining salvation and I’m paraphrasing, but they interpret “Jesus being the only path to salvation” in a very logical and practical way. Jesus is indeed the only path to salvation, for us. That’s what our church teaches and effectively guarantees. However, God may have other paths we don’t know about and the Christian church is not really qualified to speak to this.This is just common sense. A billion and a half people can’t be the only ones who get into heaven while the other 6 billion people fry in hell or whatever happens to them.

                Religion is absurd only off you think life and/or man is absurd, and many do. They are called absurdists ha haI don’t see how anyone could, after they have actually sat and thought about things, of what it took to make the world around us, knowing we men can make nothing remotely comparable, that one doesn’t at least entertain the idea that it could have been made by someone. Whatever it was, whatever entity or force made this place, it towers over us in terms of its supremacy. It makes us and takes us, so that right there is something pretty astounding. Don’t you think you at least have to tip your hat to it? And what is so wrong if people attribute this creation to a Creator? Rather than to some big bang?

            Social status and advancement must be awarded to those who believe in the tall tale. The opposite is true today. People would believe Jesus lives in their basement if the television and social media told them it was true a few thousand times.We just went through the Covid Op and saw how simple people are motivated by simple means to do terrible things. Remonstrating with them — as so many continue to do — is pointless unless you are pointing out to them that they are being left behind the crowd, in which case, they will listen.It’s not the content of the religion that matters (they will believe Covid was started by the Evil One, Donald Trump, in a Russian biolab) but what it brings them in the here and now.

        How about again becoming the mob that lynched Joseph Smith in Carthage Missouri?That Christianity was present not so long ago. I think it’s still possible to go back to our roots without creating some new branch.For Catholics get rid of the communist Pope and for Protestants forbid women to lead their congregations.Then have those babies!We will have christians excommunicating and banning the LGBTQ weirdos in no time at all.That’s my two cents.

                        Generally, Episcopalians have no idea what Episcopalians think.  I get a chuckle when Tucker Carlson makes a tempered familial poke at the denomination in a way that only a son of the church can.  Some of us are big boys and can love/appreciate/mourn it and chide it at as well.

                    I see your point.  The particular stained glass windows I’m referring to were small panels in the narthex and showed Robert E Lee kneeling in prayer with a Bible in his hand or at his side. As I recall in the church in Austin it was below and distinct from a window portraying our Lord or one of the Apostles.    Not at all of the order of an icon in the Orthodox sense or even a sacred image in the Western sense, but more of a war memorial or perhaps like an image of MLK or Cesar Chavez one could find in a late 20th century liberal White Protestant or Black church. I valued those now missing windows as a reminders of my “ancestors” who bore witness in their exemplary lives to the same faith that we observed in that sacred space.  Note that they were in appropriate places and not on the equivalent of an iconostasis.  Also, vera importantly, they were our people-  Episcopalian, American, and Southern heroes.

                        I understand that and I can be sympathetic to it, not to mention that it was probably more meaningful at the time somebody decided to commemorate Lee. Now in our parish, we used to have things that celebrate important patriotic leaders of the mother land. But the difference is, they had these things in the social hall, not in the church itself. No politics in the church! 😂

        Good essay…speaking of the English, and the need to sacrifice for their people, what we’re seeing there is the precursor to what will soon be here. This is all easier said than done. We all know what’s required to “fix” things. There is only one way. Doing that will mean sacrificing all you have, up to and including one’s life and the lives of your wife and children. Who here is willing to do that?I listen to Mike Farris a lot and enjoy his podcasts, especially lately with the DR folks he has had on. But one of the things that annoys me about him is that he constantly says things like, “…and no one is doing anything about it. No one seems to care”. What do you want people to do? There are some things people are already doing. Separating themselves from the regime as best they can. Running for school boards, etc. there is only so much you can do and it is all at the local level. Outside of that, no one is going to do what’s really necessary until they have nothing left to lose.what’s happening in England is literally the equivalent of rounding up citizens and destroying their lives for the crime of being White. In a sane world, the police who come to take these people would not make it home that night and the judges locking them up would not make it to their cars at the end of the work day. That being said, once you cross that line, there is no going back and nothing can be the same again. Who is really prepared to cross that line and sacrifice their life and the lives of their loved ones?

            If there was a meaningful sacrifice that could be made I believe I would have already made it. But with the means available to us, there’s no one target to eliminate that can produce any beneficial result. They’ll just promote another one. That’s the problem.

                Yep. Thoreau’s thousand hacking at the branches does nothing meaningful.
All you can really do to improve society is, as Nock(?) said, provide it with one improved unit. Yourself.
Maybe there will be something more once out of that awkward stage, but I doubt it. Until the very end, Satan can always send more.

            Need to remember that the Christ’s mission was specific to Him.  While self-sacrifice for the true good of others is the ultimate example of leadership, that may be manifest in different ways by different people at different times.  Hence, saints range from hermits to martyrs to warriors.

        Mormonism is looking more like a flash in the pan. If you want an example of strength and staying power, look at Islam. Maybe in another 600 years it will be as declined as Christianity is, since it got that much later of a start, who knows. But that doesn’t appear to be happening anytime soon. It looks to me like the top candidate to be the west’s new religion.

            Islam is a man’s religion. Maybe a dumb man’s religion, but it appeals to sexual weirdos, blowhards and status chasers. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nick F converts in his thirties. Your average imam is terrifying but your average priest or pastor would happily extend his neck for the sword of Islam. This is no small thing.
I’m hoping that the Russians save Christianity as Orthodoxy is the only sect left that still has some meat on its bones. Perhaps Latin Catholicism, but do we want to turn the clock back just to postpone Christianity’s demise?

                Islam is a stagnant religion.  Any time Islamic peoples try to move forward, the strictures of the religion which forbids any cultural or spiritiual innovation drags the peoples back to fundamentalism and stagnation.  e.g. Turkey and Iran.

                A sick death cult that forbids normal relations between the sexes and encourages inbreeding (most Musloid marriages are first cousin) that spreads genetic disease is a man’s religion? Not to mention institutionalized pedophilia?Islam’s Allah is a bloodthirsty maniac who demands fealty, but gives nothing in return. The Koran is the Bible rewritten by the Devil. There is no salvation, no grace. Just obedience or else.I’ve spent plenty of time in Muslim countries to know that I really don’t want that religion anywhere near me. The adherents are lunatics, ticking time bombs ready to kill the infidel at a moment’s notice.

            By their mini-vans and trampolines Ye shall know them…I think you are right about them being a flash-in-the-pan.Mormons were by far the most based large sect in the US up until around 1980, but their hierarchy is making up for lost time by trying to cuck them out with all deliberate speed.The pyramid scheme aspects of Mormonism remain strong but is proving their undoing, along with the mass migration of “gentiles” to the intermountain West.  Nevada going from the infamous “one-seed law” to becoming the first (or one of the first) non-West Coast state to decriminalize marijuana is my case in point.And the Mormons have only just recently begun to be targeted by the Jew media for cultural deconstruction.  The Guardian now regularly features anti-Mormon propaganda.  My sense is they will crumble fast when subjected to the level of cultural violence the Catholics and mainline Protestant groups have been subjected to.That said, I have found Mormons individually to be fine people and good neighbors, so long as they are in the minority.And for those who may want to steal a bride, I suggest heading for St George, Utah while there is still time.  Largest concentration of stunningly beautiful women I have ever seen.

        The problem is that the West is a materialistic society. Bothe communism and capitalism are materialist philosophies, they simply differ on how to create and distribute material goods.And once people achieve a high level of material well-being, they have the time and luxury of engaging in hedonistic behavior such and drugs and recreational sex. We are basically living in a version of Huxley’s Brave New World, and as the Democrats demonstrate every day, the way you stay in power is to appeal to egalitarianism, give out soma, encourage recreational sex, and materialism.People are not gong to sacrifice anything for religion in society founded on the idea that they are to accumulate as much stuff and have as much deviant sex as possible. They are only going to turn to religion when SHTF, when materialist society collapses, and they are out of alternatives.That is exactly what prayer is — when there is literally nothing you can do anymore, and you are helpless and completely out of options, you say “Dear God, save me…”

            Once again, XMan hits the mark.  I think it’s similar to how criminals will sometimes turn to God and religion when they go to prison for a long time.  You now have everything stripped from you – by turning to religion you look to something that transcends yourself and your material possessions.

        Again – the institutions are fine. Or, at least… they were, long ago.  Our parents inherited the most prosperous, powerful and possibly the most righteous nation on earth. And they – now, we – are running it into the dirt. We don’t have the human capital to build a nation from, and it isn’t the church’s or the faith’s fault. It’s ours. Ours is not a systemic or procedural problem, it’s a people problem.Christianity didn’t fail… we did. As for the most powerful and righteous faith in the history of Man? Welp…you threw that away too. When modernity started attacking families, it was all over. Easy free divorce and promiscuity led to ever greater social sins. Today your greatest philosopher queens seriously wonder and orate, pontificate, and bloviate about all the GOOD things trannies and pedos do for us.You talk like it’s up to somebody else to inspire you to be a better people, Z. As if we get to sit on the sidelines, heckling the clowns and carnies that come out on stage to caper and audition for a role to pose as our inspiration and the personification of our morals and values, and we don’t have to lift a finger ourselves.Let us be brutally honest – if such a man ever DID come forward to lead us back into righteousness and glory… in the current climate we’d tear him to shreds and throw him under the bus. (I remember reading an article in the NYT where some hook nosed hell mouthed jewess wrote that if Christ actually returned – she’d personally move to have Him killed). Today that woman’s tribe rules our nations and purports to speak for us.The horrible truth is today’s Americans aren’t worth a hill of beans. They’re shitty people; they’re greedy, arrogant, stupid, perverted, sinful and spiteful. So it goes for all the western countries, perhaps my country, Canada, being worst of all. What kind of country can such people make?  I posit that we are living in them and until we kill the people responsible…we are hooped.inspiration comes from within. We turned our backs on God, He has turned His back on us… and now there’s only Darwin and Murphy between us and oblivion. One of the truisms from the patriot/prepper crowd is that “Nobody is coming to save you.”We’d best take that one to heart and proceed accordingly. At this point it’s our only hope. Unless we can turn dissidence into meaningful change… it’ll be as big a failure as anything else.

            Damn, Filthie – when you’re at your worst, you’re at your best.  Your comment is right on.  Indeed, it is our own fault we are where we’re at. The relentless pursuit of comfort and convenience is leading to our inevitable racial extinction unless we right this ship post haste. We invited the hangman into our homes and bought the rope for him. Unfortunately, as I’ve said before, it will only get worse so long as we all have a warm house, a cold fridge, and a hot spot.  Something has to wake us up… and soon.

            There’s nothing that ails us that wouldn’t be curable if they hadn’t perpetrated the GR on us by deception and stealth. The American people (the decent ones anyway, who I’d rate  as maybe 1/3 of what’s left) really were taken advantage of by forces beyond their control, their government commandeered by people who wished them ill, and did them ill through subterfuge. By the time anybody realized what had really happened, it was too late.

        This post gets to the core issue with Christianity, that whoever gets to write the bible controls the religion.  The current year version of Christianity conveniently (for the regime) identifies Judaism as a friendly brother religion or proto-Christianity and that Jews, Christians, and Muslims all worship the same God.  Of course the varying pre and post Christ behavior of God can only be reconciled assuming an omnipotent being suffers from millenia long bouts of bipolar disorder.  But the important thing to the regime is that not only does it create an entry point for Jews ruling as a hostile ethnic elite, but all that faggoty “we all worship the same God” nonsense forces people to accept multiculturalism and every booga booga religion that wants to settle in our lands.  Note that even religions that explicitly don’t worship the Abrahamic God get this pass like Hindus and Buddhists.The obvious fix here is to claim that the thing Jews were worshiping prior to Jesus and Jews and Muslims continue to worship to this day is either Satan, the Demiurge, or just an evil lower-case “g” god similar to Loki, Moloch, or Yogg Sothoth.  Actual God with a capital G doesn’t give a shit about Jews and turned them into bloodsucking gargoyles after they crucified his personal avatar.  This creates an outlet for that masculine Deus Vult energy since it casts the beast races as Devil-worshiping heretics who must be put to the sword, but also allows for the high trust civilizing force of Jesus’ message.

        Mormonism offers community plus material and spiritual support.  Mormons like to do business with Mormons and do so whenever possible.  They are like the Jews in this.  I worked for an Orthox Jewish company and every vendor was Orthodox Jewish.  No money leaves the community if it can  be helped.  I’d say it is remarkably effective for both Jews and Mormons.Christians are mostly not like this, at least Catholics.  Whenever I need some service or product, I look in my parish bulletin for an ad and try to hire or buy from that person.  I recommend this to other Catholics and get a suprised look that it never occurred to them.  Some think it’s discriminatory, which is why we are in this mess in the first place.We need to make tribalism profitable for our people and it will likely be more accepted.The new religion will follow The Book of Z, if he ever gets around to writing it.  🙂

        We have everything we need embedded in our most ancient myths and our Indo-European pantheon. Our All Father is Dyeus Pater – a.k.a. Zeus; Jupiter; Odin.What we must do and who we are is encoded in what Jupiter/Zeus/Odin did in response to a tyrannical, parasitic, free-riding father cannibalizing his sons – his own creation. (Odin did this in conjunction with two of his brothers).The re-founding of this is both scientific and mythical. DNA and anthropology tell us that we are all the same people. We ultimately share the same tongue, the same blood and the same soul through the same Gods.This heritage is our collective soul. No more sad sacks who sacrifice themselves and endure endless humiliation and abuse for their father’s forgiveness. There is truth that God made man in his own image. Thus, We can and must make Ourselves in His image. He is Dyeus Pater. He rose up to do whatever was necessary to destroy destruction, darkness and chaos that presented an existential threat. He conquered the darkness with His light. He brought Order to chaos. He is the ultimate creator. In their absence, He created the necessary preconditions for an ordered, creative existence through the ultimate expression of will.Death to Saturn – the tyrant. It is time to resurrect Ourselves in His image and let Our hands be guided by the example of Our All Father.Like our Roman ancestors we will rise and before battle sing The Evocatio. This time, we will not invite alien Gods back to our temples. We will not repeat that mistake. We will invite our Gods to crush theirs.We perish seeking forgiveness or we see the peril we face and summon Our will to defeat it.

What about a good old copy of Hamilton’s “Greek Mythology”?It worked for the Renaissance, and they made some beautiful stuff.Greco-Roman seemed to have no problem with Christian in the motherlands.  Maybe taking that out is what took the piss out of Christianity.

        The mention of Mormonism is insightful here. I’m certainly no Mormon. But there are certain aspects of Mormonism that I respect. Utah and surrounding areas are the only region in the U.S. that still has a 1980’s like economy built around small to medium sized businesses. Many of these businesses are family owned. The rest of the U.S. has succumbed to major chains and brands. The Mormons have a strong work ethic, have positive regard for productive enterprise, as well as having a DIY mentality. This makes them like the Episcopalians in this manner. This is very much the opposite of the Baptists, RC’s, and Pentecostals/evangelicals. Mormon culture seems to have a pioneering spirit built in it (a fair number of L-5 Society members were Mormons and they seem to identify with transhumanism).Mormonism does offer a useful template when considering the creation of a new religion.Something else about Mormons I’ve noticed is that they seem (for the most part) to actually enjoy doing the family thing. Most other people, including RC’s, Baptists, and what not, seem to view the family thing as more of a burden or obligation to be endured. Some of this might be that the economy is built more around family-owned small businesses rather than large corporations.

            You’re on to something about the family business being one of the bonds that holds everybody together. It’s like having a family farm. Everybody pitches in and stays involved with each other. The corporate life leads to separate and compartmentalized lives, especially if you or somebody who moves halfway across the country.

                I’ve always believed that an economy based mostly on small to medium sized businesses is essential for family formation. Not only are many of these businesses family owned, but small to medium sized businesses often provide an environment where one can be a system sales guy or an engineer where you can work at the same place for, say, 20 years and not have to constantly buck for promotion to avoid being laid off (e.g. “up or out” HR policy). This is the kind of stability necessary for people to feel comfortable with having families.

            I was tracking right up until Baptists. I’m not a Baptist, (heck, according to a lot, I’m not even Christian, which is fine by me — narrow gate and all that) but Baptists are thick on the ground in this part of Indiana. The ones around here out-Mormon the Mormons in terms of can-do spirit and family/community connections. Heck, they out-Amish the Amish. The only gunsmiths in the area worth going to are Baptists.My big complaint about them socially is that they are way too friendly for an introvert like me. No eye contact should ever be made in a conversation. The ideal discussion happens when participants are staring at points on the horizon 6 feet apart. On occasion, I’ll make an exception when talking to the missus.

            If you know them by their fruits, then the Mormons stack up pretty well. The Romneys notwithstanding. Of course it’s arguable that what they hath wrought in Utah is just what happens when you have a bunch of white people living someplace without any dieversity, and is not actually a result of the religion.

        Commenting on the articles of August 27 and 28, 2024.Let’s not forget that the Kingdom of God that Jesus restored to earth at his first coming is not a democracy. He does not ask our opinion. On the top of that, God is sovereign on all things. Take your cross and follow me is daunting, challenging and utterly masculine. Any decay or weakness in Christianity is the work of the adversary. All shall be well. The Lord tares for a reason. Our job is to trust and obey.

            “God” as you define it could never be sovereign on the topic of whether or not the god exists. According to your theologians, it exists necessarily. Their words imply that there is some law of existence which is beyond the control of all willpower. Grasping egoism (Exodus 3:14) is strictly limited. According to your experts, no god or other being is in charge of existence, which is pretty much what we are told is a teaching of all the Buddhas, too.

                Why, much better, Shooter, thanks. Concepts such as the One God, which necessitates a First Mover, which demands everything-all-at-once for Creation…all of it to “prove” that we should ultimately kneel to a Jewish God, is some of the most dangerous thought of all.We are blinded by it, yet need its thrusting power to contend.

Summa Theologica is not an easy read, because it was trying to be brief over so many questions, so you have to do a lot of thinking, but most of Ride’s argument has been out of date to any literate person for at least 800 years.

                    Destroying the family was key to everything.Because a man with a wife and family knows his role and purpose.  He doesn’t even have to think about it.  That little bird chirping away in the other room, she’s my reason for existence, and my job is to support her.  Those kids, they need food.  Not very complicated.I was having some doubts recently, and then I heard my wife saying something from inside the house, and I remembered “Oh yeah, I do what I do for her.   Quit thinking so much, all you do is dig yourself a hole.”And she cleans house and takes care of me because that is her purpose.Losing hope comes when you don’t have a clear grasp of purpose. Destroy the family and you destroy everything.

        The important thing about this additive process is that Smith was recentering the moral authority of Christians between the God of the Old Testament and the God of Jesus and the New Testament. The Hebrew God is masculine, cruel, and often terrifying, while the God of Jesus is infinitely merciful and benevolent. God of the Old Testament is a warrior who loves the smell of burning flesh. The God of the New Testament is a loving mother who always forgives you, no matter what.This is a caricature of Christianity as spouted by Jewish entertainers. If someone were to actually read the entire Old Testament they would find countless examples of a loving, merciful God. The ancient Hebrews were a “stiff-necked” people who constantly went astray. They were worshipping literal demons instead of God and sacrificing their own children to these demons, and yet God continued to give them chance after chance for repentance.One of the reasons that Christianity spread so quickly in Jerusalem and the Hebrew community is because the theology behind it was more true to scripture than what was being peddled by the Pharisees or Sadducees. The coming of Jesus was a literal fulfillment of everything that was in the Old Testament.

            “This is a caricature of Christianity as spouted by Jewish entertainers.”
It is also what was preached by Marcion of Sinope. It crops up from time to time through history, and has a prominent place in the modern denominations. That’s why it caters to the most absurd policies like importing primitives and worshiping trannies.

        This discussion makes me think that we’re pretty much in the hands of fate. A new religion can’t be forced to “take” through careful planning and good execution. Same with reinventing an aristocracy or changing cultural attitudes en masse. Nobody can really achieve that through human effort alone. Will our best instincts flower again with the coming of some unforseen change? Who can say.

Declining life spans and exceptionally high junkie rates are particular to American whites and not Europeans. Also, strange for an American to use Europe as the example of being dispossessed in your own country;American whites are a minority.

            True on all accounts.Addiction and diminished life expectancy reflect a population under siege.Demographics in the United States are far worse than Western Europe. It is a legitimate fear that the British Isles will be swamped due to their unique vulnerability, but they also remain in far better shape. I do think, though, the European immigrant invasion is being accelerated so a timely response to the horror unfolding in America cannot be formed. Europe needs to sever as many ties as possible ASAP.

For me, every trip includes a tour of the local ghetto. I have never been anywhere where there is no ghetto to visit.

                                OK, but you wrote: “I have travelled all over Europe and never found a spot without evidence of drug taking, as it needles in the streets and plastic baggies in the gutters.”Now, I get that this is a hyperbole (right?), but it really overestimates the problem. There are very few places in Europe (if any at all) that are similar to Kensington, Philadelphia or DTES, Vancouver or even parts of DT Portland or Seattle.I spend about 50% of my time in two Balkan countries and these problems don’t ever show up there. I am not saying that nobody takes drugs there, but you don’t see any “needles or plastic baggies” laying around.Remaining 50% of my time is split between Central Europe and the Iberian peninsula and out of these places I see most evidence of drug activity in some German cities and in (ironically?) Iberian tourist spots.

                                No it’s not true everywhere.
Just like in the States, the worse places are always the big cities where human trash and crime collects.
If you travelled through the Frankfurt main train station then of course you saw it! Same can be said for the Amsterdam, Zurich, Milan, Paris, Barcelona main stations too.
But travel out a few kilometers where the city filth and tourists don’t go and you will see a very different world.
Get off the tour bus and come see Europe, not just the tourist destinations!

                                    You missed my point. In America, as in Europe, there are bad places full of drug friends and criminals and places free of those things. Most people never have a reason to see the bad places. As a connoisseur of ghettos, I have seen the ghettos of Europe up close, so I know they exist.

                There’s no reason to believe the government about this. Their official numbers have my very average American city at almost 80% white. Based on what I see, I’d say it’s the opposite. I remember when it really was 80%. Everything was different, everywhere, every day.Also, about 80% of the people I encountered were white.Here’s what I know for sure: White people with “customer facing” jobs are always happy to see me. It’s like they’ve been relieved of duty and are just hanging out. Doctors extend my appointments to sit around and bullshit. Normal intra-racial retail rudeness has gone extinct.That’s not only minority butsmallminority behavior. We’re not at the “instant camaraderie” stage like black strangers in old movies. Maybe that only comes if we reach ~10% (2040?). But something like it does happen sometimes. It used to never.

            This is especially true of higher IQ white women with regard to birth rates.  This is blamed on feminism, which is certainly a factor but white women of higher IQs can certainly see what the prospects for their children in America will be.

        That’s what happened!
Greco-Roman mythology was dropped from our school curricula, and Holo mythology was put in its place.
Holy Victim of the Whites mythology became the overriding theme:the Holo, Slabery, the Injuns, Colonialisms, Racisms, Womyn’s Rights, Gay Rights, Trans-Rights, etc etc.
Trad mythology is masculine.  Gods, heros, battles, capturing Helen, etc.White Oppressor mythology is feminine, because women can’t resist a chance to be a victim.

        Any religion that inspires whites to save their race must surmount these problems:
The media-induced belief that whites are uniquely evil. Instead, we must feel pride for our people and grateful that we were born white.
Our feelings of duty to expend our resources and compassion on other races. Instead, when we are called racist, we must laugh at the charge and take it as a compliment that we are so committed to our people.

        The offer of salvation was never intended as a group mass event which is one reason why we see so many falling away from the Church after these huge revival rallies and conventions. While Christ died to save the world, it’s a personal, one-on-one experience based on the faith of the individual.John 3:16-1716 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.Many people, young and old, have been caught up in the wave of emotion in some football stadium or auditorium. Only to be disappointed when what they expected was never realized weeks or months later. This is because they never had a personal relationship with Christ and don’t seek him out or make that relationship part of every day experience.As with any relationship, how can you expect it to succeed if you put nothing into it? No faith, no trust, no belief, no true repentance or understanding of who Christ really is. A walk with Christ is a daily thing, as is reading His Word. But parents who stopped attending church have little interest in their children attending. So they’re all caught up in the secular world and wonder why things are upside down.I put no faith in organized religion of any kind, but only to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. When you live in a world that has no moral compass and denies we have any spiritual future other than making ourselves our own gods, then the results are what we see unfolding before our eyes right nowjust as Christ foretold.2 Timothy 3:1-51 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.Many of us believe we on on the verge of the last days. All of biblical prophecy has been fulfilled with Israel becoming a nation the most recent. Then next event will be the Rapture which I personally hope will occur before I’m called Home.Luke 21:7-36, Jesus describes the last days:​“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”​8 He replied:“Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them. 9 When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away.”​10 Then he said to them:“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 11 There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.​12 “But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. 13 And so you will bear testimony to me. 14 But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. 15 For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. 16 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. 17 Everyone will hate you because of me. 18 But not a hair of your head will perish. 19 Stand firm, and you will win life.20 “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. 22 For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. 23 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. 24 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.​25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. 26 People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. 27 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”29 He told them this parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 30 When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. 31 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.​32 “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.​34 “Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. 35 For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth. 36 Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that isabout to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.”

            Therein lies the problem. On the one hand, the message of Christ has been contorted to mean that any connection you have to earthly reality is not only meaningless, but dangerous to your soul. On the other hand, all that matters is a life-denying, one-on-one relationship with God through Christ, whose life could never be emulated by man.
If you want a formula for the dissolution of a people, maybe all of mankind, convince them that this life is entirely pointless and all that matters is what comes after death.

                Exactly.  Oddly enough however, I remember my early Catholic teachings and that subject was touched upon a few times—always negatively.  In short, we had the promise—no, blessing—of an “afterlife” to look forward to, but *also* a responsibility to our present existence in this world.  Examples; stewardship of the earth for future generations, limitations on grieving and returning to productive earthly pursuits, maintaining good health rather than promoting early death, etc.

                        Christ’s message in the Scriptures is crystal clear –
John 3:16For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
It’s the fundamental core of Christianity. The language and message is there for anyone to understand.
The problem is how we try to “interpret” what He said in an attempt to fit those words into how we want to live our lives, and to our own way of thinking.
We want Christ to fit our way, rather than us accepting His way.

                            Sounds like we should all kill ourselves and be done with it. Therein lies the problem. One line nullifies the entire rest of Scripture, as there is no point in knowing any of it. All we need to do is believe and wait for death. Maybe if the Catholics had left that line out, none of this would have happened.

                                We were made to be in fellowship with God, but because He gave us free will, we (Adam and Eve) disobeyed God, turned to sin and thus the fall. .Every family and society has rules and laws which you can choose to obey or not. Obey them and live happily. Disobey them and suffer the consequences. Drive the speed limit, or not. Simple.But because we do live in a sinful word and can no longer stand in the presence of God, Jesus is the mediator and came into our world to provide a means to bridge that gap through his sacrifice.Yes, you could accept Christ and end yourself, but that’s not what He teaches.It’s not one line nullifying the rest, it’s one ultimate sacrifice of Christ dying in our stead, paying our debt of sin, until we can be where God intended for us to be, in his Kingdom for eternity.

                            It’s not meant to be complicated.  Just follow the Catholic Church and do your sacraments.  Minds much greater than ours have already done the heavy lifting.  Just follow their lead and meanwhile live your own life.  Leave the endless theorizing for the Protestants 😉

                I am not convinced that the Germanized Christianity of Northern Europe and even of Iberia and Italy that was re-Germanized after the fall of Rome was all about the afterlife.It was a fusion of the healthy Germanic Warrior ethos strongly connected to its Indo-European roots. The Greeks did say the Northern Europeans were the most spirited of the European people. It also fused the North with Greco-Roman culture through Latin, and the archived knowledge and culture in the monasteries. In the Mass held daily there were liturgical and spiritual outcroppings. However, there was a huge focus on how to live properly on Earth.I am not a fan of Christianity. Per my post above I think it was a 2000 year detour away from our Indo-European roots. Nonetheless, Christianity for 1400 years did serve as the religious underpinnings of the most adventuresome, worldly and martial success story of any people and civilization in the history of this planet. Something happened with the Ellis Island immigration in America that led to a total deconstruction of American’s understanding of themselves and of Christianity.The problem is that religion in The West was turned into a Coke commercial pretending we all sing in perfect harmony to try and convert young hippies into consumers, (buy Coke and your world peace fantasy will come to life). What replaced real sacraments and rites imbued with our mythos and symbolism became TV commercials which told people that by buying a Coke they would bring about world peace, or that by buying an Infiniti they would save the California Redwoods, or that by buying RayBans they would become sexy, and now that by worshiping blacks and denigrating themselves they would be absolved of sin.The absolution that Christianity offered was replaced with cheap and easy and sacrifice free consumption that the moving image told people brought it about.Christianity cannot solve this problem. The religion that has emerged did so with explicit and ingenious means to replace it. The one that must now emerge is one that will re-emerge. It is the one that is both scientific, using DNA, anthropology and linguistic knowledge and spiritual that has the soul of Our people encoded in its primary origin story about its most powerful and creative God who oversees the Cosmos and a pantheon of other important deities and numismatic beings.Along with that lives the circumstances that permit us an opportunity for an existential and epic heroic adventure. One that will both save Our people across three continents and unite them under a common Pan European identity that science and blood tells us is true. The age of The All Father is upon us.

                    We also forget that until almost early modern times there was a strong syncretic pagan element to Christianity and Christendom which we just don’t think about anymore and which in its day was felt but not necessarily talked about.Some of these more Catholic than Protestant, but still…I’m thinking of Harvest Festivals, Yuletide, roadside shrines, pilgrimages, Carnival, etc… etc..These pagan holdovers provided much of the societal glue which helped to balance out the universalising aspects of Christianity.You might be the C15 equivalent of a metic in Siena and take communion in the Cathedral with the Sienese… but come the Palio, you were a nobody because you didn’t have a Deme/Team.

            The offer of salvation was never intended as a group mass eventIt’s true that trinitarian Christianities promise salavtion to particles, but they have long preached ageneraljudgement which implies double jeopardy.JUDGMENT, GENERAL. The universal judgment of the human race at the final resurrection of the dead. It is expressed in all the creeds that affirm that Christ now “sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from where He shall come to judge the living and the dead,” i.e., the just and the wicked.This will be a social judgmentbecause it will manifest to the world God’s justice in condemning sinners, and his mercy in those who are saved. It will also be a total judgment by revealing not only people’s moral conduct but all the accumulated blessings or injuries that resulted from each person’s good or evil deeds.https://www.cmptoaction.net/library/php/guadalupeshrine/rpWord.php?wrd=JUDGMENT%2C+GENERALThe Catholic Encyclopedia at newadvent.org calls the general judgement “a universal world-judgment” and insists that “Patristic testimony to this dogma is clear and unanimous.”The Roman Catechism thus explains why, besides the particular judgment of each individual, a general one should also be passed on the assembled world.It’s not difficult to figure out now why there has been so much enthusiasm in your sects for collectivist diseases such welfare statism and swarming immigration managed by governments. Ye’re a bunch of emotionally unstable loons and psychotics by faith.

        The most inspiring, and right wing, piece of media I ever watched was actually written by a black woman. In the first season of Grey’s Anatomy (yes), there is an episode about a Chinese woman refusing treatment. Her ancient, esoteric religion requires a shaman to bless her. There is no shaman, so she elects to die.Of course, eventually her surgeon makes a bargain with her, three piece suit, thoroughly modern, Father to fly a shaman in on the hospital helicopter. He chants over her hospital bed and the day is saved.It’s the most right wing thing I’ve ever seen becuase the subject is a dying, foreigner religion so the liberal writerstreated it with respect. Theres even a monologue about responsibility to your (yellow) ancestors. But it highlights the important thing.Sacrifice inspires devotion.Occidental religions would chicken out with a “duty to preserve life” cop out. That duty to your ancestors has to come from you and it has to involve self sacrifice.To bring it into a White context. As a Southerner, I have to stay in the homeland. I have to research and remember the stories of our ancestors. All of us will have to deny ourselves for our ancestors and take the hard path. Even to the death.

        “You were welcomed into the Kingdom of Heaven just as long as you accepted Christ.”This observation is one that I’ve had for a long time and one that seems to separate me from mainstream Christianity.  The fiery converts and preachers I’ve had discussions with seem to dwell upon belief in Christ as the only way and path.  That itself is not the issue per se, what is the issue is to dwell on such to the exclusion of “good deeds” and “acts of contrition” and the all present “forgiveness” aspect of such belief in Christ.  This has been at the core of Christianity since at least the Middle Ages and the “Everyman” morality plays across Europe.We are all sinners, but it seems to me that one’s “life summary” should consider both the good and the bad.  What else are humans, except a complex mixture of the two?  A balance sheet if you will seems eminently more reasonable on judgement day.  Would we not all be better off if one left church on Sunday, to perform works (good deeds if you will) for the rest of the week to even out the score from the prior week(s)?Say what you will, and to Z-man’s point, the Jews have it over Christians in that regard.  They don’t believe in an all loving and all forgiving God, but do believe in a “balance sheet” which God will look over upon one’s death.  In sermons by Rabbi’s I’ve heard, this concept plays an important part of their instruction.  It also forms a foundation of such everyday matters as what it means to formally apologize to those you’ve wronged. An over forgiving God, seems to produce less than meaningful apologies among men.

            Here’s a challenge (not just you, everyone with “ears to hear”) — try to clear your mind of preconceived notions, and read the Gospels. Just the Gospels. However many times it takes to have a firm grasp of Jesus’ message.
Now repeat the exercise, but this time with the Pauline missives.
I think the differences are stark, and why I call modern “Biblical” faiths, “Paulianity.”

        Z says everything becomes feminized over time. That is certainly true of the West, but what about elsewhere? Islam, to the best of my knowledge, remains a masculine religion, and that is one reason it is defeating Christianity, Christians and atheists in their own homelands. In “A Boy Named Sue,” Sue’s dad informs him he gave him that name because it would force him to either get tough or die. Christianity, in theory, will either have to recoup its bygone masculine toughness or it will die. And if Christianity does again become militant, all the diverse and perverse had better look out. On the other hand, it is possible that Muzz in the West will become effeminate owing to their proximity to postmodern Christian mores and culture. In that case, Islam in the West will die along with the West itself.

            I do not think feminization is a universal. I think Christianity introduced a feminizing concept of God. As I noted in the post, the God of the New Testament is a kindler, gentler God than the God of the Old Testament.

                Why do you think it took 2,000 years for this feminization to manifest? The Crusaders were following the same New Testament.
My guesses: our media being taken over by a hostile group and affluence, which incentivized us to prioritize current comforts over sacrifices for the long-term good of our group.

                    Christianity clearly evolved over time. In order to “Christianize” the Germanic people of Europe, they had to incorporate much of the Germanic belief system. St Michael was a direct result of this, for example. The folk religion of the various tribes of Europe eventually became the folk religion of all Europeans and was even contorted to be the national religion of the emerging nation states of Europe.
The trouble is the seeds of universalism and egalitarianism were there, waiting to sprout. These are the feminist traits that have come to dominate the West.

                        Right. And in a sick kind of way, I hope the theologians who brought us this stupid, anti-Biblical egalitarianism are “enjoying” their afterlife.
What kind of theologian could look at the various parables making the point, “To whom much is given, much will be expected” and think that is at all universal or even egalitarian? I’ll tell you. The kind who would burn people at the stake for letting other people see the words and think for themselves.

                Feminization is more pronounced in the Marian cults. With God, archbp. Fulton J. Sheen probably said it best that the communists separated the Christ from the Cross and retained the Cross (cult of Labor), while liberalism tossed away the Cross and retained only the message of peace and compassion (cult of Tolerance).
In the end the root always lies with theaqua regiaof politics and ideas, the Liberalism.

            It is more correct to observe that the Church has been losing bloody wars with the Enlightenment fanatics for five hundred years or so. Why is the Church so feminized?Well, Elizabeth had all the men hanged, drawn, and quartered. The French slaughtered every religious they could find. The Italians reduced – by force of arms – the Holy See to a couple square miles. The Spanish exhumed and displayed the bodies of nuns, and crucified anyone who got in the way. The Mexicans flayed the feet of boys who defied the state.Etc. It’s not Christianity that turned itself feminine. It is the centuries-long slaughter of Christians that turned them into collaborators.

            “The diverse and perverse” is themilitant Christian army of our time. We were defeated in their Great Crusade.
Christianity iswhat Christians do: make the West’s cities African slums, worship Jews, and rape little boys. The Bible no more binds or describes them than the Constitution does the US government.
They used to be other things, but inreal life todaythey’re enemies of all civilization, humanity, and life—and they won. The San Francisco turd map is the height of Christendom.

                Oh, I’d say there’s a bit more to it than that. Jews have punched far above their weight in destroying the West, and the great horde of barbarous postmodern intellectuals were and are atheists. And it was that latter group that conquered, much like academia, the seminaries of Christianity, from which they transmuted Christianity into the toxic potion that now does more harm than good.

        The search for a new religion exposes many for their lack understanding, for the religion you choose defines you at a level most people cannot perceive or contemplate. Religion is not merely a list of useful “oughts”, but provides close to foundational framework for perception and understanding. You are only as smart as your religion allows you to be, and you can only see reality clearly to the extent your religion allows you to. People are drawn to religions they already believe because choosing a different one is an expensive mental operation.The utility of man-made religions tops out at the great empires of old. Rome, famously. The Chinese and Japanese dynasties in their ways. It bottoms out in Africa and the Americas in their ways. Islam is the religion of warlords and only makes sense if your neighbor makes better stuff than you. Choosing it is shameful.A proper starting point would be to acknowledge the leaps of the Christian West over Rome, Rome’s predecessors and contemporaries, and then examine why the the Christian West is failing now. So the first exercise in the search for a new religion would be to tinker with Christianity to try and correct its present failings, and the first goal in tinkering would be to examine if humanity failed Christianity or if Christianity failed humanity. The resolution becomes simpler in cases of user error – replace the user.To simplify, the Eastern Orthodox Church has, among other problems, an issue with false humility which leaves it materially poor and so nationally weak. The Catholic Church has, among other problems, an issue with atheism which expresses itself in poor leadership and imperial meddling – also atheists. The Protestant Denominations have, among other problems, a severe issue with authority which leaves them weak to any form of parasitism you can come up with. All three branches claim to be Christian with similar canonical doctrines while existing as quite different explorations of that general doctrine. This would be an honest starting point to this discussion.In support of my initial claims about religion, consider this: People like to point out the recent discovery that you cannot derive an ought from an is. The simple reality is far worse. Any system of formal logic you can come up with is a closed system, which means they are incapable of referencing things outside of themselves – neither the “ought” nor the “is” can exist within them. Math and formal logic will never make the leap from X=A*Y^2 to E=MC^2 because the latter is composed of external references a human imposed over the underlying system. Nothing in the system tells you whether these operations are even valid per those external references or what those operations could and should look like in reality. A great deal gets lost in translation.I am not the smartest man to have graced this planet, and a professional education in philosophy or logic systems like math and computer science should teach this by now. The simple reason for this oversight is that it would devastate many religious systems. Broad swaths of popular thought would be exposed as the domain of charlatans and fools, from the Enlightenment project of the rational human – rule by technocrat or “experts” – to the grossly misnamed race for useful “AI”.

        the religion of the West, Christianity, is in steep declineI get this image of an elderly, yet still spry wasp. He has conquered the world and elsewhere, done it all. His family enjoys his fortune and he wants to step aside, put on his smoking jacket, slippers and pour himself a drink retiring into a dark study to muse at his past and his experiencesthis to me is the white man. He has no more fight in him, no more things to conquer so he gives up the world to itself. He doesn’t want to argue distinctions  so he’s a pluralist in  spiritual and material matters, and just wants everyone to just get along for cry eye while he slips into eternity. after all he has done so much for the world it can manage now.goodnight, world!

        IIRC you wrote about how the founding of the USA was unique in that it was an attempt to create an “intentional” society. This being encapsulated in the preamble to the Constitution where it’s purpose was to create “a more perfect union.”
We all see how that went. I do not believe an intentional creation of some new religion will work out any better. It will just be another god made in our image which is just as fake as the god of secularism most people worship today.

        I think religion is downstream of evolutionary development. First you must have a population worthy of morality before it can do its magic. And that means that nature or artificial intervention must cull the weak of mind and body before the spirit can thrive. Our society is infected by pathogens few in number but powerful in impact. Until that scourge is removed, there can be no rebirth of spiritual enhancement. What’s needed now is a crusade aimed at the parasitic pathogens that afflict us. Where are you Vin Diesel?

        To laser focus on the decline of culture and religion and the corrosive effects, there were two historical examples we can study- Handsome Lake’s religious reforms of traditional Haudenoseenee religion into the Longhouse Way in 1799, or Wovoka’s Ghost Dance. Both have lessons to be learned.
One was successful and is practiced today, and one was a bloody failure.

        I appreciate Zman taking on this issue. It is thorny as many people have only experienced a functional christian community and are unaware about how fragile our civilizational religion can be.I see many get lost in the assumption that the only alternative to be an orthodox believer is to be an atheist, or in the idea that Zman is naive about how hard would be to engineer a functional religion given that many humans will stay at the religion they were born into or the one that gave them a solid emotional support after an adult crisis. Being too reflective about your religion is not good and it is only necessary for elites and people that were burnt by a bad experience in their Church.But many, like me, are more cerebral and would not fall into a religion as adults easily even knowing how awesome is creation and how bad secularity has been for western human societies. So for us a more practical religion is needed. One where you are aware of buying into it without the need of a revelation that has to be transmitted by fickle authorities. I used to be very religious and for me my belief was anchored in the trust of a religious authority and a naive (&lt;- not always a pejorative term) belief in revelation that would be sustained by certain ‘miracles’ of the Church being the foundation of the revelation.I am too young to have witnessed Vatican II directly, but I was close to a priest who lived in Rome at the time and witnessed of how turbulent were those times. It is very believable that the Church was attacked from the inside and forced into modernist ideas. At some point you have to have some standards for a Church that proclaims to have the correct interpretation of the revelation and for me the Church buckled up too easily, leadership sleeping at the wheel case. In another point, even as a believer I saw the circular way the Church is revealed in the gospels, and the gospels are authenticated by the same Church. After some point you realize that faith is a subjective act, no way to ‘prove’ it or to pretend that it is very rational to know what Church is authentic.Maybe it is the next step in our journey as humans to build a religion that needs a deep awareness of the previous history of religion and culture. We need antibodies that cannot be held inside ‘mysteries’ and threats of punishment. We had a very good religion in the west but it lacks antibodies against egalitarian cults. We need to restore the awareness that Europeans are different and even our Christianity is European in shape. The universal Church needs to be swapped into a European Church. Maybe we need two for each side of Europe. We need to be also aware of minority groups that work to erode our morals in the name of equality and liberty. Those concepts are fake and ghey.I do not see intellectual power in the current Churches, I am aware of the debate bros on YouTube and I find them lacking. I am very fond of the TLM communities and have a lot of respect for them. I also have a lot of respect for Mormons and the Amish. It seems keeping a good religion alive is the destiny of the USA, hard to find communities like that outside. I know Europe has some TLM people, but I see the US branch more organized. But these communities rely at the end on a blind trust in a transcendental superhuman power protecting them from moral errors and institutional blunders. We need to build a more self aware religion for some elites. I am aware that the masses can and need to rely on mysteries to keep themselves motivated and sane. But apparently God needs some secret elite societies to direct things. People aware of the weak points and the real enemies we will always have and be antibodies by acting when it is needed.We can call the group the Do Not Forget “The Hard Times and How They Were Created” society. Asimov had a similar idea on his Foundation series. We will protect the TLM folks and other similar peoples from the outside.

        It seems complicated but.. It might just be that the answer is as simple as just going back to what worked for 99% of human history. The social experiments of the 60’s have failed. Multicult and thoughtless tolerance and acceptance have failed.We were strong and healthy af up until ww2. There was a unipolar boom in the 50’s that lasted a bit and was very nice but was ultimately fleeting. But how did people live before then? What were their values? It all comes down to the natural order, we need to get back to what is true and natural. Their social experiments have all failed.

        Christianity got us into this mess with its focus on compassion, but concocting another version of it without the compassion is just piling one idiocy upon another, which is exactly what the Mormons did. Those people exist in their own little world and give me the shivers. They’re no template for a new civilisation.People need a cohesive preoccupation, but why religion? Communism did without religion altogether having replaced it with their socialist struggle, though that turned out to be only a phase. O’Brien in “1984” was cynically concocting cohesive preoccupations to keep society under control. This is basically what Z is proposing here, only basing it on the old Christianity.There’s no need to jump from one concocted belief to another. What we need is cohesive preoccupation with common sense. Balancing compassion with hard-headedness is common sense andthat is the entire solution. Any other solution is temporary, messy, and doomed.

        I would encourage those who lean toward protestants to take a close look at the churches of christ.Yes, the ones that kicked out the religious loons that Nick Fuentes is now probably taking money from which doesn’t surprise me at all and the ones that one of the founders of Mormonism, Sydney Rigdon a former member of the churches of christ was kicked out of.My view is Smith never saw an angel what he saw was a way to have sex with multiple women and make some money at it.The traditional churches of christ do not allow women in leadership, do not have instrumental music, and do not practice Christian Zionism.

                I get where you’re coming from with that question. My grandparents’ Presbyterian church was a hardcore Scottish/Ulster Irish denomination that only sang Psalms acapella. They claim it is biblical to use only the human voice for worship. I am Anglo-Catholic, an Episcopal priest who resigned my orders to convert to Catholicism, and was used to pipe organ and often a professional choir when I served a wealthy parish.  Of the two I much prefer the organ and hymns.  But the Presbyterians sing much better than the Anglo-Catholics in the pews and they actually seem to be worshipping when singing their Psalms.    I’ve listened to unaccompanied “shape tone” singing— I believe it is a tradition arising from the Church of Christ tradition— and it is also quite beautiful.One of my parishes had a wonderful five voice choir for the Latin Mass— we were nosebleed high church — and it gave me a huge appreciation for choral music.  Part of my journey also was worshipping in a Melkite Greek Catholic church where the the chanting was unaccompanied; the Arabic/English chanting in the Antiochian tones are what I imagine the heavenly chorus to be. The horrible singing accompanied by electric organ at my current Catholic church is a price I must pay for leaving the Episcopal Church behind.  I really do want to wear earplugs it’s so bad

                    It’s probably my inner Ayn Rand talking here. But I’ve always viewed the art and music should convey virtuosity and accomplishment in a sense as to create an emotional reaction in people. Of course this is not a stated objective of any of the identified religions on the planet. So your mileage may vary.

        Christianity is too soft and forgiving???  Sinners are forgiven only if they repent and make a sincere effort to amend their lives.  Unrepentent sinners go to eternal torment in hell.  Even sinners who *do* repent are, according to Catholicism,  also doomed to spend some time suffering in purgatory (which is like hell but temporary) to atone for their sins.  Since we’re all sinners, the outlook seems pretty bleak, and the sincere Christians I know are all worried about whether they have repented and atoned *enough.*  Possibly the “Christian” churches with female pastors and rainbow flags are as feminized as you claim, but they don’t seem to be making a great success of that approach; their constituency is small.  By contrast, traditional Catholicism is growing, with  the Latin mass restored in many churches and conservative young priests replacing the Vatican II cohort as the latter age out.Joseph Smith was a con man and fraud.  How he was able to get people to accept his implausible stories and false authority, even into the present day, beats me.

        The question Zman leaves out here is *why* Christianity is in steep decline. Certainly not because it doesn’t work, because it works better than any other religion to produce successful societies.My theory is that it’s because much of the bible is bizarre, useless, and/or wrong, and yet the preachers howl deafeningly that we must revere every ridiculous jot and tittle. And for millions, maybe billions of sensible people, that is simply never going to happen.IF a charismatic leader could organize a New Christian Reformation that stripped the theology down to the bare essentials for good living and soul-cleansing, (including Jesus of course) then it could swiftly revitalize itself and boom again.And that is much to be desired.

        I don’t see a place for a new religion (as classically understood), unless there’s a great material collapse incoming. Ideologies or cultural movements could be sold more easily, religions require believable miracles, aside from their material offerings. In the age of smartphones that leaves mostly the third world peoples as good candidates (Evangelicals gaining new converts in Brasil come to mind).Accumulation of fads and haphazard current-year beliefs dominates the landscape and the desire for timeless, iron laws appears to be lost upon the media-polished brains. Tendencies like traditional Catholicism appeal mostly to the non-conformists who wish to go against the grain. A new faith could probably achieve a breakthrough with some major advance, like space exploration. A massive Cross on Mars could be an affirmation of a resurgent faith and a symbol radiating beyond, towards the new lands for Christ in the Milky Way. Probably not enough to restore the mainstream domination, but a powerful enough faction.Something new could emerge maybe from an endeavor that combines the material advances (conquest, occupation, production) and cultural expansion laden heavily with new, active-participation entertainment.Gesamtkunstwerkcomes to mind, but in a more aggressive and totalistic form (in the Digital Age that’s easier than before), that could captivate minds for a time long enough to establish a New Normal. New clans/communities, new styles, marching in conquest and raping the dominant forms (tik-toks featuring militants having fun with post-modern art, disdainfully guzzling craft beer and wrecking coffee shops), essentially a new (anti)culture. The main challenge is to avoid becoming just another performance in the post-modern age before the bland reality sets in again. Post-revolutionary terror is a must-have. That kind of trauma could facilitate some sort of religious revival or at least allow to enshrine a new ruling philosophy.Anarchists from ANTIFA and other collectives have become a part of the system, because being bored, degenerate kids from the upper and middle-classes they are not alienated from it in any meaningful way. Like the bored French aristocrats dressing up as peasants inhameauduring Rococo era, play-acting street revolution is all they need.

                Long hours of grind only for a new, disappointing expansion to complain about ;D
Who knows, for generations that grew up playing video games (mine included) this could be a working model. Raiding beautiful people’s “dungeons” in ad hoc parties or clans and complaining that warlords keep killing fun as they demobilize, increase their own share of loot and restrict the raiding privileges.

        Trying to found a new religion today by claiming a direct revelation from God is going to be very, very difficult.  We simply don’t live in a culture that takes visions seriously–people claiming to have them are regarded as mentally unbalanced.If I had to nominate an existing religion that might pull the European peoples in both Europe and North America out of their present plight, I would choose Islam.  It’s a reluctant choice because Islam has never allowed much free inquiry and has stifled science.  But I’ve often wondered whether a North American version of Islam that made more room for Jesus, even at the expense of Mohammad, might find a fertile ground in today’s United States.

            For a neo-tribalistc revival, Islam is a good candidate as an alternative (created for clan-based societies, decentralized, prone to sectarianism). The question is, whether it’s desirable or can be spread reliably, especially with South Americans in mind.

Well, that, and Islam is a rape religion founded by the same Jewish zealots that killed Jesus, so…no, as in HELL no. It’s a nigga religion with nigga dick.  The “hate jews” thing is an inheritance fight, like Joseph and his brothers.
The entire religion is based on the culture of force breeding soldiers.Not a White thing, that’s not us or for us.

        There is a strange revivalist type Christian offshoot, Bethel  Church, in Redding, CA. They are growing rapidly and are in the process of taking over local city government. From just a few thousand members in the 1980s they now have membership approaching 15,000. Lots of money involved. Here is a description from wiki of their emphasis on faith healing and other “miracles.”“Bethel Church focuses on miracles. It teaches that all miracles described in the Bible can be performed by believers today and happen regularly, includingfaith healingof everything from curing cancer to regrowing limbs,raising the dead,speaking in tongues,casting out demonsandprophecy.[22][2][23]Services may have congregants laughing uncontrollably,lying on the floor,[24]shaking, staggering, screaming,[22]and dancing, which they teach are signs of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Leaders claim to have witnessed angels appearing and “balls of electricity” that throw people into the air.[22]One of the most well-known phenomena is a cloud of what is claimed to be gold dust or gold glitter that has been seen falling from the ceiling of the auditorium.[22]The church has uploaded videos to its YouTube channel, calling it a “glory cloud”…
