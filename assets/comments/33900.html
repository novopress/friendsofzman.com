        My post is not about the Russians or the Ukes. My favorite hobby horse about the dishonesty of the media is the Dateline NBC Chevy pickup truck hoax. The pickup trucks had what was called at the time ‘side saddle’ gas tanks that sat between the skin of the truck and the frame. The truck getting t-boned would potentially rupture the tank. Dateline got a hold of a test facility and a bunch of Chevy pickups and started to ram into the side of them, hoping for an earth shattering kaboom. All they had was a bunch of ruined trucks and puddles of gas. Someone had the bright idea to stick a model rocket motor in there and they got their fireball at the expense of little old me never believing anything I see on TV anymore.

                How do you give them a pass?I remember the incident/report well.  The report was that these trucks were involved in increased (burn) fatalities due to the faulty gas tank location.  The entire set up was to demonstrate that process through the scientific experiment of duplication.  Try as they would, they could not recreate the hazard—even in a perfectly controlled environment.  So they changed the environment to (as I remember) use hidden lighted flares, which ignited the spilled gas.  Presto, fire!The film and report failed to declare that the test was not of a natural occurring accidental environment, hence leading the public to think the trucks were indeed more hazardous in real world crashes.  This is simply fraud and slander.  No one —other than the media—benefited from this lie.How does anyone “give a pass” to such?  Hell, I’ve seen any number of accidents where the fire dept was washing/hosing spilled gas from around the wreck.  Spilled gas is not that uncommon.  What is uncommon is it igniting upon impact like a cheap Chinese firecracker.

                    Same thing with the Audi 5000 sudden acceleration and Ford Pinto exploding gas tanks and the “unsafe at any speed” Corvair. Scams, every one. I remember being dumbfounded that the official death count from exploding Pintos was just 25 over the better part of a decade.

                        All of the agony the automakers went thru to make sure there was a mechanical stop in place inside the gearshift unless the brake was pressed. On account of people forgot where their feet are.

                        Hey, don’t forget the Ford Explorer/Bridgestone Tire fake crisis.
Supposedly tires were spontaneously exploding and so, to save The Children, Ford had to change its factory tire manufacturer.
It was all fake, and the result was Ford’s French(!) CEO at the time secured multi-year purchase agreements for French-made Pirelli Tires, from the worlds largest automaker, and the American stalwart, Bridgestone, got the shafted.
Lies, lies, lies all the way down.

                            Also, the fake AK47 test they did showing how destructive the 7.62×39 round was on a watermelon.
Turned out the round went right through it and they had to use a .44 Magnum HP to have it explode!

                            Or when the unions were passing faulty tires to squeeze Firestone for some deal.  Those bad tires were getting people killed in accidents.

                            I was a ford mechanic during that time. It was Firestone not Bridgestone. Easy mistake.Firestone had been supplying original equipment tire to ford forever, anyhow this is exactly what happened &amp; it was mainly to do with Explorers.The Explorer had  a CD changer in the center console, when the tires were inflated to 34 psi the CDs would skip. Ford’s fix was to deflate the tires to 24 psi &amp; change the decal in the glove box and the LF door to state 24 as the proper inflation level.This somewhat elevated the CD skipping problem.however  most drivers rarely actually check their tires &amp; over time inflation levels fell lower &amp; lower, it wasn’t uncommon to see levels in the mid &amp; low teensThe problem started in states where the climate is hot during the summer ie Arizona Nevada etc. The tread would become unbonded from the caseing &amp; tires would blow out at times causing serious accidents.Ford blamed Firestone &amp; the great company divorce was the result. Every Firestone tire had to be replaced on every vehicle at every dealership &amp; going back in some cases five plus years. The whole thing was redicuolus. However many of us were able to acquire several sets of brand new tires.In my opinion I thought ford’s decision to lower tire pressure was the major contributing factor to the debacle.Where I was working at the time (PNW) I had only seen evidence of impending tire failure on an Explorer that was from Nevada.Anyway that was my take on the issue from boots on the ground at the time.Long winded forgotten history.lol

                    It’s like a movie. It’s just a depiction of what happened. Trucks had previously blown up. They staged it to help illustrate what happened in the past. I don’t think it’s a big deal. Now if trucks hadn’t blown up in the past and they staged it, that’s another matter.

                        You still don’t get it.  They staged an event that never happened and then claimed that it did and used it as an exemplar of reality.  If you can’t understand this, you are deficient and doomed to be fooled/exploited by all around you.  Quit doubling down.  You lost this one.

                            Well, like I said, if they’re just doing it to illustrate something that has happened before, I don’t know that I have too much of a problem with it. I guess they should label it “reenactment” on the TV screen. If it hasn’t happened ANYWHERE, then you are correct.

                        “Trucks had previously blown up.”
Yes, just like the gravity-feed (no wires) central fuel tank of TWA 800 blew up,the Rockaway airliner’s engines fell off because the pilot pressed the rudder pedal too hard,the WTC #7 fell into its own footprint because shaking,or the incinerated Waco children’s bunker had a shell hole because gun collection.
Nope, no knock-on effects there, nosirree.

            Why couldn’t they report the truth? It would have been an easy scoop by that time after all the hysteria? That would have been acclaimed everywhere as responsible reporting.
But no, it’s instinctive with these doofuses to do the opposite. Blood may play a role. Won’t say more, I know Z does not like the triple surrounds.

                        I just learned the other day that Luigi Mangione could have had hidden motives in the assassination ofBrian Thompson; that Luigi’s GRANDFATHER, Nicholas Mangione, was the founder of “Lorien Health Services”, which is at least a theoretical competitor to UnitedHealthcare.
If Luigi Mangione really off’ed Brian Thompson, so as to improve the financial prospects of Lorien Health Services [to the detriment ofthe financial prospects of UnitedHealthcare], then we’d be talking about a literal 21st Century Michael Corleone.

                Yes. This is a counter revolution. In a proper society the White House would be running nightly updates to the American people and presenting updates on every aspect of the project:Homan with the Weekly Deportation and Demographic Restoration UpdateMusk/BigBalls with the Weekly Corruption and Fraud Investigation UpdateDOJ with the FBI Weaponization Corruption Update … …This would progress from research to evidence to naming the names to the prosecution and execution of the nest of vipers and criminals.post-America the carny show didn’t do that. The empire needed to preserve the illusion of an independent media that is objective that reports. So, deep state actors, oligarchs, … … go on Fox/CNN/MSNBC to maintain that illusion.Like the revolution, the counter-revolution cannot spook the American people too badly by violating those norms no matter how ceremonial and illusory.Pam Bondi is using the form to provide those updates while, hopefully, her staff below her is doing the proper work that is truly radical in rooting out corruption.Sadly, it is a superficial way. I would prefer the overt, and martial approach. The Revolutionaries took the mask off. It is only a matter of time before either Our side does and we win or the carny act continues because we are afraid of the name calling and accusations and they come back and it gets very ugly when they have no compunction about winning by any means.I think they have mismanaged the DOGE and Border Invasion information warfare operation. They should be tying them together and giving regular updates as if it was a trial. It is a trial. Mayorkas, the NGOs, the Churches, the Departments, the Hotel and Airline and Bus industry … … all need to be shown to have colluded on this invasion and profited from it. The names behind it must be named and they must … …You know. In any case, Bondi is working within the form. I don’t think it is megalomania. I just think it is the residue of the dead system and them trying to keep a semblence of stability and order. I bet a significant number of the American people, based on the stop the steal rally, are way ahead of the counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, they must have some domestic order as they need to hold up the empire well enough not to have a total and disorderly collapse.It is a gigantic mess.

                    Agree that they need to be more communicative,  but not on matters that are indictable. Particularly with naming names. The defense will argue that the publicity has made it impossible for his client to get an impartial jury anywhere in the US, and judges will either gladly or begrudgingly concede the point and dismiss charges.
It’s the content of the Bondi releases that gives me hope there may be handcuffs sometime in the future. None of her releases to date (that I know of) would taint a jury pool.

                            Why should Homan display charts?
Because we want to confirm what is actually getting done.
I fear that when the dust settles, Trump’s deportations will be as lasting as Trump’s wall in the first term.
There are many articles in the mainstream media that say that Trump’s deportation numbers are below Biden’s and Obama’s.  Of course, these stories could be lies, but it raises the fear that TRUMP IS ONLY TALK.
Any confirmation that the administration can provide of verifiable accomplishments would help.

                I never pollute my mind with cable news at home, but recently on a road trip, I turned it on in my motel room, and Sean Hannity was railing about the double standards of the left. I was dumbfounded, it was his exact same show from 20 years ago, nothing had changed. I turned it off after a minute or so.

                    Hannity makes me vomit. All the guy talks about is Israel and how bad the Muslims treat “women and gays.”  I cannot fuckingstandhis whiny, Long Island accent and neocon Boy Scout shtick. It’s so obviously an act, and an obnoxious one at that.
I haven’t listened to him in years. If the radio is on when his show starts, I instantly turn it off.

        I’ve never had a high opinion of Hanson, whom I’ve always considered an establishment dullard. I know you often write disparagingly of US conservatism. I consider Hanson to be a big chunk of the problem. In fairness to him, I think he still has his wits about him but that just makes his prostitution all the more contemptible.

                        A woman with three names, worse if hyphenated, signals she suffers from the LMV, Liberal Mind Virus. Likely ‘settled’ for some soy man with future divorce planned.
An odd phenomenon in recent years, some of my Normie Disney-Cruise relatives’ wives ‘added’ that third name on their Faceborg pages. And yes, they are LAF (Liberal As Fuck) but I doubt they do much of the ‘F’ to their husbands by the looks of it.
Matching Disney sweaters, yes. Married people hotel room sex weekends? No.

                            There’s a temptation to use three names if you’re named Joe Smith. For a writer, it adds a bit of panache to call yourself Joe Darnell Smith or some such. Another trick is to go by your Middle name so you become J. Darnell Smith, but that’s a lawyer thing. I don’t know if this will become a trend among pols but there’s our new spare, J.D. Vance.

Hey, those neu-males can still send you to a non-compliance camp.

                        You really need to overcome your obsession with women. Many of ours have enough intelligence to see gaps and wrinkles in your favorite personality cult, so they aren’t going back. (When they don’t see any of the doctrinal defects, l’m happy to point one out. For example, there is the one about a loving omnipotent god who deliberately taints his created humans with originated original sin.)On occasion, an alert woman may ask a minister or other wannabe expert about the gaps. Should one of your ilk respond deceitfully, as ye are always wont to do, she may detect that sliminess, even if only subconsciously. With that the expert has subverted trust which he never earned in the first place. He forfeits any right or possible right to obedience.Of course, you find this situation intolerable. Hence your desire for our females to shut up and obey you, or those ministers and politicians whom you see fit to obey. You want them to corrupt their own thinking thoroughly by believing you. You want them stupid and submissive like a randomly selected “Latina” in the land where you settled because, no doubt, you want to avoid awkward confrontations with disbelieving women who are more intelligent than you.As it turns out, you differ from a modern female democrat less than you suppose. She, too, will become frustrated when she encounters a person with starkly different beliefs which she can’t overcome. Suppose that she meets a boy or man.who rejects as fraudulent anything called democracy, which can never be established democratically. (Can you explain why briefly?) There’s an important difference, however, between you and the democratic female. She doesn’t run away from her territory.

                            Found the male feminist!  Women are one of the main vessels the enemy uses to subvert nations.  It’s been happening for millennia and never more successfully than right now.  Yet you get upset when a masculine man puts his foot down and says ‘ENOUGH!’.  You’re clearly too weak to be of any use to our side with your jumbled, scatterbrained diatribe and nebbish disposition.

                                Whining about women on an online forum board is not in the least masculine. There’s something to be said for a calm discussion about women in the public sphere. (No, they should be there.) Unfortunately the older bachelors and the MGOW types give off “venting personal frustrations” on the subject.

            Victor Davis Hanson is still a reasonably good analyst of the situation in California.  His bookMexifornia, was part of my journey to this side of the great divide.  But he is hopeless on Ukraine/Russia.
Hanson is also only four months older than I am, so I don’t think age is much of an excuse!

                    100% accurate. I made the same point about him a couple days ago. He is fully aware of the disaster immigration has done to California as it has directly impacted his farm and every farmer he knows. He even cites examples of Mexican crime and destroying the land that his family has owned for generations. But then he makes sure to signal that it has nothing, nothing at all to do with race. He knows that would get his gravy train canceled. Just a weak, weak man.

                    Yes, in a recent video VDH went out of his was to describe, anecdotally, his need for an ambulance to take him to the hospital.  Three attendants—Hispanic women—arrived to treat him.  From there of course the story went to “what care I the color of the cat, as long as it catches mice” tale.I can all the more appreciate this anecdote myself, having been in such a situation recently—a tale of imminent death and a traverse through our brave new world of multiculturalism in the medical field.As I’ve noted before, VDH takes one so far into the current situation affecting us, but no further.  That’s for folk like Z-man and those here to continue the journey.

                    RE VDH, I spare the man because he fights!He does slip up sometimes.  His two-month long obsession with proving Darryl Cooper wrong after the Tucker interview revealed that his career is irrevocably anchored to the Left’s WWII mythologies and heros, and so he cannot be counted on to help dismantle the Left’s redoubts there.Still, he joined Pat Bucchanan in his early nineties,’ precient attack against illegal immigration, and his fluency in antique history can be enlightening at times.I still listen to his podcasts on the weekends, and, if you’re working around the home on a Sunday morning and want some educational entertainment, I recommend them highly.

                    Yes. It is almost like the civnat proper stance on immigration, … … are just a way to get the base to see him as legitimate. He is the embodiment of the Con Inc. scam. I’ve been talking about these issues for 35 years but those lousy Dems keep screwing up. Keep voting for my guys and we will finally have power to do something about it.Yet, they had the power and kept talking.And now that you think I am the only hope let me tell you about the latest imperial ambition.If there is good news, it is that he had the book about how civilizations disappear overnight as a scare tactic to pivot to China. In the meantime, as Americans looked around and saw that they were already a minority in every town city and countryside they just shrugged and saw that China was the least of their worries – that VDH and his gaggle of imperial hucksters were just a sham.I don’t like the idea of punching old guys, but every time I see him I think he needs to be taken out back by the village and roughed up as an example that this won’t be tolerated anymore. Of course, that is just a fantasy. VDH got his life of comfort for himself and did nothing for us.It was all just red meat placed onto a trap.

                I paid hard cash for his book, “The Case for Trump”, written several years ago — eight years ago maybe? One of my criticisms of him is how unbelievably dull he is, similar to that fellow David Brooks at the NYT. Has either one of these characters ever been laid?

Also, like Douglas Murray, he writes books that shepherd people to the edge of the Great Divide but then throw their hands up and conclude with “I dunno, let’s have a public debate?”

            Like the Lightbringer (Obama for the masses), Victor David speaks in a manner that convinces Normie of his intelligence. Apparently trained at the same school where they crafted ‘Buh-rock’ as his spouse calls him.A lot of gravitas created by pauses, um, uh, and such devices. His tone, so soothing to the ear. But listen to his words — Putin’s “unprovoked aggression” is one favorite. Another is undying Zionist fealty to a small nation.Despite the trend towards longer monetized videos on YooHoo tube, his are not only short, but the main point is repeated as an intro — to make sure Normie stays tuned and gets the point.Just the fact that he is in ‘Academia’ is a massive red flag.

                My introduction to VDH was reading “The Western Way of War” decades ago. I didn’t even realize his political perspective until many years later.
I feel about Hanson the same way I feel about Michael Anton: I suspect he knows the truth, but will not articulate it for the sake of his career.
Not honorable, but understandable given the alternatives. Although Hansen really has nothing to lose at this point, and he seems to become more cringe with every post.
I basically tune him out now.

                    Well, just because he’s a professor with a salary doesn’t mean he’s paid well. I still recall being invited to the office of one of the new molecular biology profs at the school I went to some years back and seeing the offer letter they sent him laying out on his desk. I was pretty shocked at how little the guy made. I think a lot of academics will whore themselves out to Israel, or Ukraine, or Lockheed Martin backed appearances on Fox News because it’s where they make most of their money.

                At a certain point, folks like VDH—there are many—begin to get so many requests for commentary, that they begin to stop investigating/developing new knowledge or confirming old. In a sense they become stale.  They rely on their reputation rather than what made their reputation in the first place.  If VDH believes what was in the cited article, then he is of the above.
I prefer to believe he has allowed such publication by a lackey and has been sloppy in his oversight.  I’ve not seen such myself in his other punditry.

            I remember when Hanson used his perch at National Review to cautiously question (some) GOP  orthodoxy and observe that Trump was a symptom of conservatism’s failures.  I was already there, and appreciated that he was shaking things up a little at Cuck HQ.He eventually embraced Trump and MAGA, but never seemed to understand or acknowledge that America First is also a rejection of neocon foreign policy.I always assume that these people are chasing shekels, but he also seems sincerely locked into a Cold War US-as-world-policeman stuff.  Mark Steyn is not as bad, but has a similar blind spot.  Old dawgs, new tricks?Or maybe I’m being too nice…

        This wilderness of lies is vast. The subject of that show about a white boy who murders a girl by stabbing her came up in a conversation this week. The women I was talking with watched the show and can’t stop thinking about how devastating the situation is. Their takeaway is that online bullying is causing young white men to stab girls. I haven’t seen it but I reminded them that it is a work of fiction. I brought up the real and tragic case of Austin Metcalf and his twin brother. They had heard of it but weren’t aware of details. Because of the massive lies, there are people who are fretting about trash pieces of fiction designed to malign and demonize their own white children rather than focusing on reality.

            I haven’t see that piece of propaganda yet, but I’m told one of the reasons the white kid stabbed the girls, was because he was an incel, a 12 year old incel. Amazing. Right thinking people believe 12 year olds should be sexually active

                I’ve heard that in the actual show he stabs her to end a campaign of bullying against him based on hersayinghe’s an incel, a redpill guy, etc., because that’s what girls say about nerds now. The kid only looked up Andrew Tate etc. to find out what he was being bullied for.That’s what Carl Benjamin says happens, and he doesn’t lie (though he’s often wrong).If so, the propaganda campaign hinges on everyone lying about the show, mirroring the bullying of the kid in it, and institutions taking those lies at face value, like the cops in the show who, in pursuing and interrogating the kid, continue the girl’s bullying of him on the false premise she established.That’s sophisticated irony—and impressively thorough coordination/brainwashing.

                    There have been two or three ever notable cases of incel violence, and the most famous of them was a non-White. But they want you to believe these man bites dog stories are the real trend.
Dramatizing the thousands (millions?) of cases of egregious black violence against Whites is, somehow, out of bounds.
They’re of a kind with the same propganda leading the US government to insist that White Supremacist violence is the greatest threat to the US. I wish.

12 y.o. boys rarely are sexually active and typically are just beginning to have sexual function at all.  Flailing for the ‘incel’ button by the govt and Normie is standard o.p.
Alienate boys from a female-first, feminist society and then scapegoat them when your bomb explodes.

            “…fretting about trashpieces of fiction”Here’s afascinating analysis ofThe Matrixby a guy who uses the name Wyatt Stagg. He insists, among other things, that the traitor Cypher is the white man who rejects the multicultie program and the life of sacrifice and servitude demanded from us for a project devoted to our own destruction. For this unforgivable sin, Cypher is executed by a brownskin, of course.The video is a bit under 20 mins. Well worth watching if you’ve ever been a fan of that movie or are sick of people talking about being red pilled, this pilled, and that pilled.

                1st Matrix is a great movie, but there is an irony about “red pill” become part of dissident right.  Certainly, there is an implicit “pro diversity” message by the many races of Morpheus’ crew and the whiteness of the agents.  And Cypher’s real name as “Mr. Reagan.”
And of the course the matter of the wachowski brothers being total trans freaks.
Still can’t take away that it is a brilliant movie.

Yes, and you are correct that there was some brilliance behind the movie. There is some brilliance evident from the torahs, too. A problem is that the brilliance makes those insidious scrolls no less toxic to the unwary foreigner.

                    It was the late 90s, the assault on normie life was on. See also: American Beauty. Also, because 90s, it was edgy techno-hippies leading the charge against the machines. Kind of a contradiction there.
A transitional(!) film in the end. The freak show won irl— and became the Matrix. Because contradiction. Idk, makes the head hurt.

                        Late 90s movies were wild. . .
Matrix, Fight Club, Office Space were phenomenal in channeling the mounting unrest.  Even though Matrix was done by trannies and Fight Club a homo.
American Beauty and Pleasantville have to be the most 2 of the most anti-white movies of all time.  Also, throw in American Pie for further valorization of teenage degeneracy.

                            The first Matrix movie wasn’t really that great either. But the concept rocked.
It’s funny, all these folks who claim to be “red pilled”….. the bit about the last refuge of free humans being named Zion seems to go right over their heads.

The main issue with the first Matrix movie is that it’s not hard to understand the human body is an enormous energy sink.
That single fact makes the entire machine-dominated world depicted in the film completely impossible.

                                    There were a lot of other stupid inconsistencies there. What do you want?

            It’s not just propaganda…Just a few weeks past, here in Central FL, about one hour N of Tampa a 16-year-old Juliet snuck out in the middle of the night for a tryst with her 16-year-old Romeo, who reportedly stabbed her to death. Details are sketchy, but the perp appears a white male.

        The first time I remember being shocked by this was the “gravitas” comments that echoed through the media during the 2000 election. I had not heard that word used much until then, and it disappeared afterwards. It is shocking how much coordination, gatekeeping, and payoffs are used to keep all us little sheep on the farm. I laugh now when they talk about some other country not having a free press like we do.

            Similarly, I remember Obama making a comment about the strength of “American institutions” after the 2016 elections, foreshadowing #TheResistance. Immediately after, up until present day, it was all the media could talk about. The American government at that moment became a sacred ground for all things good on this land. This led directly into the post-1/6/2021 talk about the Capitol being holy land that was desecrated. Nobody talked like that beforehand. You can go back to the founding and see what people said in political cartoons and the like about the stinking pit that is the US Capitol. All of the sudden though it became unpatriotic to criticize anything in DC.

Good point.  To Them, D.C. IS sacred ground, thus the hysterical, brutal and unlawful reaction to J6 and the violation of their Chamber.  Reads like a bodice-ripper.  Understand your enemy.
They’re the priests and priestesses of the sacred District of the Goddess Columbia, and they take their territory very seriously.  It’s a spiritual war, always.

            Bit of a tangent here but your post and Z’s mention of Limbaugh showing videos of media-bots all using the same phrases got me thinking that it shouldn’t be too hard nowadays to set up an AI that could automatically identify the Party Line on everything in near-realtime. It could probably generate the montages automatically too. All that remains for the humans to do is add the “Entrance of the Gladiators” (the famous clown music) background sound track.

                The trick is keeping the deception limited to a dull roar. He had already lost us, and would never regain his credibility with us, but people want to hear their opinions spoken from the mouth of an authority figure. Everyone, including us.
VDH doesn’t care about credibility with us. He cares about it only in larger demographics. Demographics worth targeting.

        The last racial hatred that is not only allowed, but encouraged, is that against Russians, and you can feel that radiating from the neocons and their lapdogs like Hansen. That’s part of a very long tradition in the West going back centuries, that the Russians (and Slavs more generally) are subhuman barbarians who are not quite Christian, European or civilized.

            The present hatred of Russians is pushed precisely because the RussiansareChristian, European and civilized. In this respect then, Russophobia is simply the clearest manifestation of anti-white racism. Only whites who betray their own race and civilization can escape it to some degree. The Russians have refused to do that.

            “that the Russians (and Slavs more generally) are subhuman barbarians who are not quite Christian, European or civilized.”
Amusingly, that can be applied with increasing veracity to the western Europeans right now.

            In 1877, the London tabloids sent ‘war correspondents’ to cover the Russo-Turkish War.
They were soon breathlessly reporting “rapes” and “infants on Musselmen bayonets” to their readers.
It goes WAY back.

        The progressives have found no substitute for virtue. They can offer only such morbid stopgaps as contraception, abortion, and euthanasia. The Dark Ages understood virtue and built a civilization; the progressive age doesn’t understand virtue and is tearing down the civilization it inherited. Euthanasia is a fitting symbol: the last sacrament of a society that cannot aspire to heaven, but only to painless annihilation.

            They have a definition of virtue all right. Follow all their tenets and you are virtuous. Simple as. What they don’t have is a reward for virtue (other than unlimited homo sex). Every singe one of their “virtues” are self abasing. This was also true of much of Christian virtue, but there was the reward at the end which “woke” lacks. I remain puzzled by how they gain any adherents. (other than homos)

                Women, and men who want to please them. That’s who. Women want a rule book for life, or at least a moral checklist, approved by appropriate consensus. After checking off the boxes, they get a gold star, and are considered a good person by the rest of the herd. No critical or independent thinking required, just follow the rules and you won’t be cast out.
Conversely, True men welcome the solitude of exile.

The cloying, oppressive feminine atmosphere is palpable. Most of the teachers are women and Beta males. Fortunately, the world they are trying to create is in the process of being destroyed. It’s men who run the world and it always will be.

                “This was also trueof much Christian virtue”
The opposites of lust, greed, envy, gluttony,  anger, pride, and sloth are not “self abasing” but self-purifying. The supposed virtue of blind obedienceishowever very selfabasing. Those who preach it for the churches need to be crushed as much as any schoolteacher who browbeats her pupils for “our democracy”. Another problem with Christianity is that the goals (vicarious salvation, Heaven) are wrong, just as “the pursuit of happiness” is a wrong goal.

            Wow! If true, the implications are profound. I take that to mean that they realize that their little project of deconstruction, destruction … … through mass immigration, advocacy of White genocide … … has blown up in their faces and they want to back off of it without taking their share of the blame. Alternatively, it means the cause has been advanced far enough that it gets managed through to its next phase by the existing managers who are never named.Of course, Potok and those blood thirsty folk need to get taken out by the managers as their public advocacy is too conspicuous.It is hard to know. To Z’s point. You don’t know who to trust. A guy can say anything. We have to focus on our locus of control and build real networks of high trust. I think that is the take-away and the real action from today’s post. We live in an increasingly low-trust society where elites have ingrained in them that they have no duty other to than themselves. So civilization has collapsed. When elites have feel no duty or obligations theh by definition civilization has collapsed because power feels no civic duty. Everything they do do is for themselves.Hopefully everyone here has an existing high trust network that is off line or is working to building one.

        Media corruption is a subject too large for a small type single spaced 500 page book. Or even 1000. One wonders if it has achieved sufficient ubiquity to redefine what is the accepted norm, and what is corruption. I believe it has. That is, if your opinions are not for sale, not coordinated with others in hopes of achieving some political gain, then you are the aberrant deviant. This is because, sometime in the past, truth, or the seeking of it, became no longer a virtue. Was it always this way, and I am just kidding myself that it has ever been different? No, I don’t believe so. I believe I can remember a time when it was different. Certainly not perfect, but different. A white society could come out this cycle on the other side, eventually, and start valuing truth again. Fill it up with brown people and I don’t know if that’s possible. As some astute poster opined here a few months back, 3rd world countries don’t go through cycles. “Once you go brown, you stay down.” Everything is about the GR.

            The key thing to remember is that an emphasis on “Truth” with a capital “T” as a virtue is uniquely a Northwestern European Christian thing. No other culture or people on the entire planet value the truth as an objective good.What hammered this home to me was doing business in Asia. China, Japan, Korea, it does not matter. There is no opprobrium attached to lying… Only to losing face in front of one’s superiors.Then you can begin to understand the “Why” of the fact that as our culture has become less Christian and less NW European, the truth has become less and less important.Of course, Jesus had some very choice words for those who hate the truth…“Why do ye not understand my speech?evenbecause ye cannot hear my word.Ye are ofyourfather the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.And because I tellyouthe truth, ye believe me not.”I wonder if it is a coincidence that the same group of (((people))) being addressed in this passage control most of the modern media?

                I’ve seen Christians making the claim that the Scientific Revolution happened when and where it did precisely because of the high value Christians placed on Truth. One might say that, while Christianity is monotheistic, The Truth is something like a demigod or perhaps even part of the Godhead. Science was able to succeed because it made use of regularities and principles in nature that were ordained by God. The study of nature was a way of studying the mind of God.As Christian influence has waned we also see a lack of respect for the truths of science, especially those having to do with biological realities like the differences among the races and between the sexes. I think there is a connection here.

                    A part of the Godhead, yes, or rather an aspect of Him. In creating the universe, He poured His essence into it, just like when He breathed life into Adam, He imbued man with a bit of Himself.
To increase your understanding of the world was to increase your understanding of Him. The whole “search diligently” thing.Your method of gaining that knowledge had to be rooted in truth. Or Truth.
I think they were probably right about that.

        I respect VDH as a historian and his work on the ancients. Yet I cannot take anything he says about current affairs seriously and have not been able to since he equated the United States to the 300 after the movie came out.
As for beanie boy, what can you even say? How stupid is he? Does he not see the Daily Wire imploding? As EMJ often says, it’s over for these people and these narratives. Nobody is taking them seriously anymore. Nobody is going to watch a conservative justify genocide and war crimes anymore. It’s not 2004.

                    There is a pattern there to be Noticed. Catherine the Great expelled an ethnys to the Pale of settlement, now decendents of that ethnys teaches us that she fornicated with horses.  Edward II expelled an ethnys from London, now moviemaker decendents of that ethnys say Edward’s son was a tosser and Edward r*ped his daughter in law to continue his line. A certain ethnys launched a failed rebellion in ad 66 when Nero was emperor, now we are taught Nero was a sicko pervert.At this point in life, I completely disregard any allegation of a famous person being a degenerate if 1) it allegedly happened before 1964, and 2) that person is hated by a particular group for any or no reason.

                Now there is a name I haven’t heard in a while, which says it all really. The ground has shifted beneath the feet of all these clowns and they don’t realize nobody is buying this junk anymore. Now, people like Glenn Reynolds and Hinderaker are old and in thrall to this ideology and propaganda so I get it to some extent, it shows up in the polls too, but a younger guy like Tim Pool? Unreal.

                During the run-up to Desert Folly 2 I was working at a defense contractor. They let us watch CNN and Fox news streams on our computers. We liked this of course because it gave us all something to do that wasn’t really work but counted as such. I recall sitting around one guy’s cubicle as some government spokesbot on the newsfeed rolled out a giant TV and pointed at a blurry blob of pixels and told us “here you can see Saddam’s WMDs”. I looked around at the others and even then I could see that I wasn’t the only one thinking that those pixels could have been a part of a digitized old Polaroid of someone’s shoe.

            “Hanson became famous, and rich, pushing the Iraq and Afghanistan wars starting after 9/11.”Most likely untrue. Check out all his book publications.  They were prior to 9/11.  He had a great reputation as a scholar of military history prior to 9/11.Victor Davis Hanson became a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution in 2002. Prior to that, he was a professor of classics at California State University, Fresno.  It’s a coincidence that his present position was at the time of 9/11, but in any event, these tings were in the works before most of the SHTF regarding 9/11 and aftermath.What monies VDH made after 9/11 I’m not privy to, if you are, outline them.  His reputation and income source I’ve cited were made before 9/11 IMHO.

        Part of what we’ve discovered over the past 20 or 30 years is just how easily it is to buy influence. Put together $50 million (which isn’t that much if you have a cohesive group like Jews or Muslims or a bunch of billionaires) and you move mountains politically and culturally. Form PACs, NGOs and legal groups and then start bribing/threatening your way to influence.
Of course, the real power comes with bribing and blackmail which is where the usual suspects have such an advantage, but, still, bribing/threatening will get you a very long way.

        “…you cannot trust anything.”That phrase should be uppermost in the minds of everyone who comes here. I scan headlines from news aggregators with this firmly in mind. Almost instantly, my first thought before clicking on any of these stories is, “Why is this story here?” My next step is to see which news company the story is coming from. Most of these pieces are erupting from New York corporate sources, and we know what this means. I really don’t like visiting these corporate websites, because every click merely helps them. The sooner we wean ourselves completely from the clutches of these psychopaths, the better. For those of you who have learned how to spot these weasels,here is another good example. And be sure to read all about the author in the blurb below the story.

            “Rather, the realist claim should be this: There are inherent fault lines in the Russia–China relationship, the most important being Moscow’s concern with playing junior partner to an economically more powerful China.”Realist? This is a baseless assertion resting on willful ignorance. With the exception of a period in the seventies relations between the two nations has been good. Their trade ties have only grown stronger since the fall of the Soviet Union, and especially since the start of the SMO. Xi Jinping nearly called Biden a liar to his face, while his meetings with Putin grow warmer each time. Now Trump wants a trade war with China no matter how costly to actual Americans. Only a neocon or a paid substitute could utter such nonsense that the West has the power to drive a wedge between Russia and China.

        Did you see that some judge is ordering Trump to let the Associated Press back into events?
In this day and age there is no reason for “the press pool” to still exist. The White House should just start a livestream for each press conference or anouncement and take questions from superchats. First x non-repeat questions get answered.

            If the Trump admin fails to assert that access to the WH press pool is not in the jurisdiction of any court, since denial of such is not a violation of anyone’s “rights,” then  it is truly weak and feckless. But as I recall, this same thing came up in his first term and they genuflected before the almighty court then.

“The Court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists — be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere — it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,” he wrote in his ruling. “The Constitution requires no less.”
At some point, the only response can be ” F@#k off!”
Shortly after the judge’s ruling, though, two AP journalists were turned away from covering an event that Trump attended on Tuesday night, the agency reported in an update on Wednesday.﻿Cool

        Every time I visit my boomer parents (good people that they are), they always have on the right-leaning “news” channel that spouts the same tired, old “conservative” talking points.In my head, all I can hear is Frau Farbissina from Austin Powers.“LIES! ALL LIES!”For Gen Xers like Z and myself and many others here, our parents were raised on TV in a way that we weren’t. They believed the pompous news readers on the 5:30 p.m. “news” cast without a doubt. They believe what they read.I always had a degree of skepticism, but after COVID and George Floyd, I came to the obvious conclusion that it was as Frau said. Nothing but lies.The democratization of information via social media is great for those willing to examine the prevailing narratives and find counters. The old TV “news” cast and the 24-hour anxiety-creating “news” operations will be thankfully dead in a few years, much as newspapers.I only watch the local TV news for the weather forecast. Since I live two hours and change from a majority-Black major city, I really don’t care about how Jonquarrius killed Shitavious over a dice game or a “drug deal gone bad.”Recently, I read of the spring break exploits in Florida of some “teens” who shot it out with some rivals at a crowded venue. The best part were their names.They were Kevin Tyrone Moore, 18, Jamarion Lamont “Lil Poop” Baker, 15, and Avaughn Brown, 17.Lil Poop. LOL. Even the thugs are running out of good street names.

                I don’t think they can accept that they no longer live in a high trust society. It’s been hard for me to accept, but easier once I made the journey over the great divide.
I hate assuming that everyone is lying to me. But considering what’s happened in this country since the War for Southern Independence, the truth has been distorted in so many ways great and small.

Yes.  I think for most white people, telling the truth is an instinct.  When we go against it, it’s like handling feces.
Another great step in awareness is learning that our kind of inner life and instinctive values are not shared by most people on the planet.
Semitic people, for example, lie to each other as easily as breathing.
At first, it’s hard to accept and believe about others.

            I’m a younger boomer (Generation Jones) and although I grew up watching many of the usual shows as a child, I got bored by t.v. easily and preferred books.  I would come home from high school and find my younger sister watching daytime soaps, and kick her outside to find something else to do.  I essentially stopped watching all t.v. in 1976, when I left for college – and then years overseas, living on my own, overseas, again, etc.  My husband watched far more than I did, and we had cable and Fox News from about 1996.  Again, I got bored and began to get news online in the early oughts – and that transformed my worldview.  I again stopped watching all t.v. about 2010. When we moved from suburbia to rural bliss 2 years ago, my husband surprised and pleased me by dropping tv cold turkey and switching to internet news only as well.

It’s iterative, too. Even before getting into how badly infested the online right sphere is with its own grifters and pageantry, it unfortunately, and rather impressively, takes about five minutes for most newly minted older “Cain’t trust tha teevee!” types to start enthusiastically interacting with AI slop from jeet spam pages on Facebook.

        As others have pointed out, the West and by extension its media lackeys devote all their Ukraine agitprop to negotiating with itself, dreaming up nonsense like a DMZ or a freeze in the battle lines or nonexistent European “peacekeeping troops” or a no-fly zone. The minor inconvenience that Russia must consent to such plans in order for them to even begin to happen never arises. The fact that she has repeatedly explicitly rejected such plans might give a real statesman pause, but the West has no statesmen. Even Trump looks oblivious to this.

                One cannot overstate the importance of the homo-tranny issue in explaining the Ukrainian war. I guess that if Putin would have just allowed homo parades and let trannies dance in front of school children then there have been no color revolution and no war.
Why is homo-tranny promotion so mandatory for our rulers? Because the goal that unifies all of their actions is that they want to destroy the cultures of traditional whites.
I know that I’m preaching to the choir. The coffee just kicked in.

        “As citizens trying to be as informed as possible, we find ourselves in a wilderness of lies.”I have a young adult female relative of the feminist left persuasion who I told “You have been lied to.” This was in reference to how the Ukraine war started. She flipped her lid and went ballistic in a kind of panic mode. It occurred to me later that her generation has never not been adrift on a sea of lies. We were, too, but didn’t know it so we still had the emotional serenity of thinking, even if merely illusion, that we had some idea of what was going on.The younger generations have never had that. The more intelligent of them know they are being lied to, but they have not been taught the cognitive tools to navigate through them. It doesn’t help that there really aren’t any ‘good guys’ to back. The kind of capitalism that Pres. Trump supports, at least by alliance association (Musk, etc) is a non-starter to them. They don’t want to live in the world that Pres. Trump is trying to salvage from the wreckage of globalism. I don’t either for different reasons (expelling Africans and Guatemalans but replacing them with Musk’s H1B Dots-&gt;I’d rather see it all burn), so I don’t blame them.We approach Full Weimar Territory.

            “We approach Full Weimar Territory. Left and Right and everyone in between agree that they want the old order swept away, but disagree over with what to replace it.”Good summary.  She will have to pick a side or one will be chosen for her.  Your thoughts are being echoed by some sage pundits as of late.  When the “middle no longer holds” and collapse occurs, what will inevitably rise are the extremes.  We currently term them “Left” and “Right”. The Weimar comment most appropriate.How one teaches one to navigate through a sea of lies (critical thinking) eludes me as such requires somewhat higher intellect and I really don’t know how to teach “smarts”.  You have it, or you don’t.

        ‘In a world where you cannot accept a man’s opinion as his opinion, you cannot trust anything’Old America of extended families and close-knit, small-to-midsize towns curtailed the forktongue.  You got to see those people at Little League, you know?  Likewise, Christianity and extended-family structure held deceit in check.Scripture makes consistent points about damning oneself via inveterate lying.  Says this whole world is under a ‘cloud of deceit’.  (really? wow whatta shocker eh?) lol  But you’re correct, in our atomized anon societies lying has exploded.In my adopted nation there is a ‘culture of petty theft’.  Mebbe New Amerika is a culture of lies?Hanson I warned you about yesterday.  Part of the Club You Ain’t In.  And I don’t want to hear any excuses for signing your name to another man’s work.

        I’m going to double dip today because of something I read in the last few days about the Boeing Starliner fiasco, the “truth” of which is now coming out. The thing was broke AF and that’s why they were stuck up there. Which everybody knew, but which the regime spent 9 months denying.What would have been so scandalous about admitting that right up front? What were they afraid of? Things break, people understand that. Did they cover it up because they believed it could be damaging in an election year? No, that’s ridiculous, people don’t vote on the basis of spacecraft malfunctions.I believe that what has happened is that, over the years, gradually, lying has become so ingrained in the MICOM/intel culture (of which Boeing is a part), that it has become first principles to lie. About anything. About everything. That when a press release is issued about something, it is always a lie, because that’s what they do. It’s who they are. It has become their DNA. The truth is not in them. Lying is SOP. Another Thursday. Both first instinct and institutional policy are to lie. For “national security.”

            When the new guy came in at Boeing, one of the first things he did was fire that diversity hire who ran that division. How long it will take for Boeing to turn things around is anybody’s guess but it starts from the top so he got off to the right start.

        Closely related: look up this YT video.https://youtu.be/6-2ifl6AEvkIt’s a non political electrical engineering channel. Yet even this guy was solicited by a business in the paid media industry. He looked into this grift and shows how you can pay to get your content promoted in all sorts of places a casual viewer would never expect. For example, the next time you watch some business news channel and see what purports to be a story about some new and interesting entrepreneur or product, there’s a good chance the “news” channel was paid to promote it.

        The propaganda corrupts everything. On YouTube I follow a Zoomer who calls his channel whatifalthist. Pretty sensible for a guy in his 20s but you can tell that his data is biased by our media and education system. Russia on the verge of collapse? Nope. An East African Union as a potential 21st Century world power? Yeah, right, if only those countries weren’t full of Africans!

            A lot of internet music guys—the kind who are actually corporate shills (“influencers”)—have received the same regime instruction this week. Out of nowhere, urgent, all caps: TRUMP TARIFFS WILL DESTROY THE [equipment] INDUSTRY. “There’s no such thing as an American-made [anything].” Suddenly music too is a sub-discipline of libertarian economics.It’s just common sense and decency.The guaranteed loss ofrealaudience from becoming “political,” “taking a side”—saying a bunch of stupid shit that makes no sense, that normal people take refuge in fringe-interest media specifically to avoid, etc.—is not a consideration. Why isn’t it?“Everything is fake and gay,” we say, but the extent of the fakeness is greater than almost anyone is comfortable believing. Rationally, we have to assume that anyone who succeeds to any degree in the current system is wholly compromised. So…We won’t. A false world is uninhabitable. We’ll pretend it’s real. “Gell-Mann amnesia” foreverything.

                “A lot of them look very chïnky to me.”
It’s called “Indio”.  There is a mixture of European Spanish (from the Conquistadors) and South American “Indian”.  Most all Hispanic men in the Southwest have a darker hue, Indio mixture regardless.  Women less.  However, the high caste MX have different (White) facial features.  The basic difference I notice with Indio mixtures is high and pronounced cheekbones.
Given where these ancient people came from—Siberian landmass connection—it’s no wonder they look “Chinese”.  That’s closer from their heritage.

        The article cited wrt VDH is indeed a bad look.  I am surprised.  VDH’s recent YouTube videos would seem to indicate a reasonably astute/aware oldster.  That he is a dyed in the wool old school Boomer is not in question.  However, the errors in the cited article defy explanation except that it was written in his name by neocon ideologues.  VDH earned a reputation—before political punditry—as a solid scholar of military history.  I’ve read most of his books, they are solid from my perspective.My criticisms on the current VDH have been made known, but they’ve nothing to do with his prior scholarly endeavors. VDH has a sinecure at the Hoover Institute and his books and articles must bring in significant revenue. I can’t believe he needs money and has “sold out” for such.This is a good catch and analysis by Z-man.  Yes, I agree—in this new world of lies, nothing may be taken at face value.  All authorities must be questioned.  Is that not what we do here in the group?  It is tiresome however and requires great effort.  Sigh….

            Having been in that business for decades, I can tell you this: the stupid ads invading our lives are not aimed at us. Not the notional consumer.  They are designed to flatter the people who pay for them, and the public is a secondary consideration only. This is how you get absurd crap like casting so many blacks in commercials that one would think they were being aired exclusively in Lesotho. The people buying ads and producing them are almost wholly standard issue shitlibs.

            More than 1/2 the ads I see are just scams.  We need new regulations to reign this in.  The platform should be responsible for any losses incurred by the end user for their failure to screen the ads.  They can regulate every freaking word posted to social media regardless of format, yet somehow, they cannot spot all these outrageous scam ads.  There is no way of reporting scam ads to the platforms.  Even the ones that aren’t just flat out scams, they make claims that are so outrageous that only a moron should fall for them.  But they keep doing it, so it must work.

                Recent example: I repeatedly am served ads that claim I can get Wal*Mart car insurance as cheap as $19/mo, yet the same panel also says $39/mo, which is a more realistic figure. Well, maybe not. I pay just under $100/mo. and I’m about as good a risk as exists in the auto insurance market.

        Someone calling zim-self kryptos says keeping up with current events is itself propaganda; making more difficult deep sustained thinking that sticks to one topic and to first principles . He gets this from a guy calling zimslef Jacque ellule.its hard not to hear of current events but if you don’t actively seek them out, I think the effect of them diminishes. I remember I did some lent program years ago and they said to stop social media and I was a little shocked that they followed this wise prohibition up with, but you can read news sites in order to stay informed. Why do I need to stay informed all the time even during lent?Kryptos also says those who think they are immune to propaganda are the most vulnerable to it. He also seems to say it’s the technique that is characterized by efficiency models of government and organizations and cooperations that produce the propaganda, not necessarily purposeful liars.

        As untrustworthy as “journalists” writing for the MSM are, they are like saints next to the average “influencer”  They are fame and money whores.  Once they have a sizable audience, they want to monetize it.
The promise of social media (at its best) would be that everyone could have a platform to post their opinions on some general topic occasionally.  BBSes would be for people heavily connected to a single activity, be it knitting or Macintosh computers.  Instead, it turned into platforms for narcissists and liars.

        Rush went to Israel in 1993 for at least 2 weeks , maybe more.  He was an ultra zionist upon his return.   He was always a neocon before but his influencer tour turbo charged that.  After 9/11 he was a full time shill for going to war in Iraq.   The guy was a mixed bag but he was generally good on immigration

        Putin may not be trying to reassemble the USSR, maybe the Russian Empire— maybe-ish. All the business about civilizationalism.
I’m OK with it. Just like Trump with Canada and Greenland. Maybe regional empires, or federations, or United States, or whatever you want to call them, are the most stable and successful states. I think the US was at its best as a continental empire, for instance.

The ((West)) has been been playing Genocidal Risk for more than five centuries, but the board game has been around since only 1957. Few Boomer and Gen X kids of our people ever appreciated the ironic cultural significance of the latter or learned from the former a good lesson, say, what goes around comes around.

        With regards to Russia, I can tell you that the American “war hawks” peddle complete nonsense. I am Russian, and the situation doesn’t look like we have a war at all. If you don’t access the media and don’t live in Kursk or Belgorod, you can have the impression there’s peace.Economic markers like observable inflation also seem to be almost independent of the war and sanctions.We did experience some problems at work due to the sanctions, but it’s a very specific field (space electronics). Eventually, it resulted in using more Chinese components where we are still reliant on import.

        Years ago, VDH had some pieces on National Review Online promoting the Libya war.Zman and others (like me) quickly called b.s. and to his credit, VDH actually listened.  That’s when we noticed him starting to talk more about the b.s. behind the Libya operation.  One of the few times when we saw people in the comments influencing the contributors.Most of the anti Ukraine war sentiment on the right mirrors opposition to the war to overthrow Libya.  And all the shockingly bad lies then, were recycled for Ukraine.  “No boots on the ground”, for example, was a lie in Libya and it was a lie in Ukraine until that NYT report finally admitted what we already knew.A lot of these writers are just profit centers.  They operate a brand and the brand generates content.America has turned the page on Ukraine.  None of the old tricks worked.  Trump’s plan is to burn political capital making Nation-altering changes to the US economy.  Expect a lot of people to start comparing this to Reagan ‘81 before the recession really hit.Since we now know all the polls are lies (Harris knew all along she was going to lose…the media lied anyway and ran polls we now know were fake), odds are good that Trump is well over 50% approval.

            There’s no perfect “key” to spotting honest brokers. But the more negatively that homos, jews, and negros are portrayed, the less likely it is to be globohomo controlled news. I’m not under any illusions that I’m getting nothing but “truth” by mostly sticking to dissident media, but I’m certain it helps prevent The Current Thing from colonizing my mind. Sometimes, I miss important “cultural” events by being as unplugged from MSM as I am. Like occasionally I find out about some significant thing that happened 5 years ago that I missed. Small price to pay.

            It’s like reading ancient history. Is Josephustrue? Can’t check. He says what he says.Assume that nothing really happens, that there’s nothing to keep up with. Everything’s a lie, so whatever news you happen to encounter has the same “truth value” (none). The meaning is in how it’s worded, who’s blamed, what it wants you to do, etc.A couple days ago it wanted you to panic sell into a dip, make yourself broke, and blame Trump for it.That’s the news.VDH wants young men who can’t get into Stanford to die and become “war studies.”That’s the news.
