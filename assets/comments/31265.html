        There‚Äôs an interesting element of your thesis that you may have overlooked.  While a true believer may overpower the cynic in the short run, the believer is ultimately pitching a belief system that promises some sort of favorable outcome or is making prognostications about the future that will, eventually, be put to the test.Religions that have their ultimate reward as a paradise in the afterlife retain an advantage because the veracity of their claims is unknowable.Masks and vaccines were a belief system.  It didn‚Äôt take long for the bulk of the new converts to conclude the masks are stupid, pointless, and quite likely dangerous to your health.  The covid vaccines went from ‚Äúyou will not get sick, you will not go to the hospital, and you will not die‚Äù (Joe Biden, CNN town hall, Oct 2021) to ‚Äútake it or lose your job‚Äù to a 3% acceptance rate in the span of 2 years.  The belief system peddled by the Wizards of Science! was put to the test.  We now know the vaccines make you more likely to get covid and they cause heart problems.  They remain the ONLY drug commercial on TV that does not disclose side effects.  The only one.  Think about that.The true believers are now in a panic because their various prevarications about the 2020 election are being revealed.  The election clearly was rigged.  Suppressing true information so that voters don‚Äôt know the Democrat is taking bribes is rigging.  And the FBI led that effort.  Trump is clearly being targeted by the DOJ and FBI not as a criminal but as a political dissident.  It‚Äôs bizarre that the believers cling to the idea that he committed some sort of crime.  It‚Äôs so bad he‚Äôs being accused of some weirdo concept called ‚Äústochastic terrorism‚Äù.  Maybe it‚Äôs in there somewhere, but I suspect those words do not appear together in the US Criminal Code.And then there‚Äôs the tranny problem.  And ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù.  At some point your belief system better deliver.  If all it delivers is a kook sexual predator or an extra inch of snow in February, people will just ignore you entirely.I have a simple belief system these days.  I read and hear the news and say to myself,  ‚ÄúI believe you‚Äôre full of shit.‚Äù

            I‚Äôve noticed over the last decade or so the climate change predictions getting farther in the future, so they can‚Äôt be tested (anytime soon). Used to be we‚Äôd get stuff like ‚Äúsea level rise will cause flooding in 20 years!‚Äù but now they put it off til 2070 or so.

        ‚ÄúThe most obvious and likely reason for this obsession by the regime and its toadies is that they think the election was rigged too.‚ÄùNo, the reason they are doing it is because they know most people are sheep and forcing deniers to become accepters has a powerful effect on such people.  The fact they rigged it is secondary to this.‚ÄúA better answer or perhaps a companion answer is one that also explains the inappropriate response to January 6. Not only did the regime wildly overreact in the aftermath‚Ä¶‚ÄùAgain, incorrect.  The regime acted very rationally in their response to J6, as well as their reaction to the MI governor kidnapping.  The chilling effect both such incidences will have on any sort of future attempt is huge.  Obviously a legitimate regime would have no need to do such things, but of course our current regime is illegitimate.  History has shown that illegitimate regimes need to crush even the appearance of resistance.

        The US is simultaneously waging 3 wars against the 3 groups the Tribe feels are is historical enemies:
1. Russia and Russians
2. Palestinians
3. White Americans to the right of the divide especially if they are Christians.
The Tribe is not made up of underachievers.

        Simplicius published last week an essay which is related to today‚Äôs topic:
ESTABLISHMENT ALARMISM in Overdrive as Raytheon Lloyd Threatens Congress with WarSIMPLICIUS The ThinkerDec. 7, 2023https://simplicius76.substack.com/p/establishment-alarmism-in-overdrive
Expect cloud people‚Äôs paranoia about Russia to ebb and flow during 2024. Expect cloud people also to bring the USA much closer to conscripting a half million arrogant, male WASP‚Äôs to fight in eastern Europe for $omething or oüïéer. Pretexts will include, of course, liberty, defending Con artist law, and stopping the new new new Hitler.
WASPicide has no downside.

        2020 was the year voting jumped the shark.  Besides the usual hijinks. demographics and the reversal of Roe v Wade will prove too problematic in the future.  Republicans have been in a downward spiral since then, and I don‚Äôt see it changing anytime soon.  Even if Trump gets elected, this country probably has at least 40 million illegals from the 3rd world.  Would he really deport that many of them?

You don‚Äôt need to deport all them. You need to deport a small amount of them AND make it known! They ‚Äòll leave on their own if we ‚ÄúJust Start Saying NO‚Äù

            In Operation Wetback, roughly 750 federal agents deported about 300,000 illegals in one year, while another one million self deported. Rough estimates, nobody really knows the exact numbers. The government claimed 1.3 million illegals were deported, and that‚Äôs probably something in the ballpark of how it went down. There was some assistance from local law enforcement.

        Today‚Äôs conversation on the Z board .made me giddy and the reason is, Z presented us with reasonable arguments that the wicked are afraid. And people here smelled blood and rose to the occasion in a hunting mood. This may just be online but I think the emotions are real enough. When they show real weakness that will happen on a massive scale. And they will lose control. This was like going after the first deer of the season. Now more wants more. This is how they fall

        As a side note, going out in public lately, has anyone notice a sort of weirdness in the air?  Everyone looks at you like they‚Äôre either about to burst into tears or they want to kill you.  Just odd.  I can‚Äôt explain it.  Maybe just on the leftard coast.  Maybe all in my mind.

            I have to agree with you. Looking at Tucker‚Äôs new ad for his network, he states what are considered ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù and will still get you banned from social media. It is a bizarre time, unlike any in my life.What with every ‚Äòx‚Äô number of people that pass by are masked-up, wild-eyed nuts. Even in ‚Äònormal‚Äô settings you see them.Your own friends and families are filled with people that dare not ‚Äògo there‚Äô in terms of their collective ‚Äòall in‚Äô for the jab, ‚Äòthat poor man‚Äô Floyd‚Ä¶. the thing of the month, Ukraine, whatever. It goes on and on.One really is a Stranger in a Strange Land, but surrounded by the weird, the odd, the childlike.And truth be told, the above describe MOST of our closest people.

            There is a palpable tension ‚Äì for lack of a better word. I believe everyone is noticing the weirdness and the masked freakazoids don‚Äôt help the situation. Most people we‚Äôve encountered out and about are friendly and apparently trying to weather the storm.

            Shit has been weird since the COVID nonsense. It‚Äôs not in your face like it was 2-3 years ago. It‚Äôs receded into the background for the moment, but now that you know just how many people out there are truly insane and that you can get blindsided by them at any time, it‚Äôs hard to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again.

        All right, I‚Äôll be the one to ‚Äògo there.‚Äô  I will presume most here can/will agree that most of the frontmen of this regime, as well as its financiers and the ultimate string pullers, share a certain religious/ethnic heritage.  These individuals are not known for moderation in their response to challenges or even mild criticism ‚Äì both personal and corporate.  We are dealing with a group known for both overt and situational collusion, paranoia, and the need to win every argument.Some term it Finkelthink, others pilpul, but it‚Äôs even more than that.  It‚Äôs the accumulation of generations of telling themselves and their progeny that they are special, smarter and thus more successful than everyone else, and thus unjustly persecuted and hated for their God-given place in the human hierarchy.  For example ‚ÄòA,‚Äô go skim some of the comments over at Sailers place (I do so for laughs and out of boredom).  You will see the same repetitions, lies, evasions, justifications, pontificating, preening, bragging, and whining that mustache man noted.You will also see hundreds of responses attempting to appeal to the writer‚Äôs supposed logic, common sense, common ‚Äòcitizenism,‚Äô and common humanity.  Even in the face of endlessly repeated irrationality and intransigence, these dupes keep imaging that THIS fact, THIS comparison, THIS appeal, will finally win through.  Someone once said something about continually repeating failure and expecting successful results equally insanity.  Exhibit A.So let‚Äôs apply this as a metaphor writ large.  Paranoid and self-righteous people, in a bubble/feed-back loop, repeating blatant untruths and demanding not just passive agreement but active fealty.  Speaking of hoary chestnuts, Orwell anyone?  Seriously, why is any of this a surprise?  And why does anyone expect a limit to this depradations?  They are ‚Äì as their foot soldiers like to crow ‚Äì Large and In-Charge.  By popular acclaim, even!  But you dare to doubt?I suppose I‚Äôm just old, but I remember laughing as I laboriously translated articles from Pravda and Izvestia in college.  And not laughing quite so much as I researched and wrote about propaganda in grad school.  And even feeling a bit smug as I observed the heavy-handed surveillance and suborning I experienced in Eastern Europe.  But they won in the end . . . back ‚Äòhome‚Äô where I expected to have my kids grow up in a homogeneous neighborhood with white picket fences.  This is an old script, but people just can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt accept it for what it is.  Yes, it‚Äôs all rotten and crumbling ‚Äì they‚Äôve been eating away at the foundations for over a century now.  It could all come crashing down tomorrow . . . or it could plod on for another hundred years.  Sudden death, or gradual decay, pick your poison.But no further analysis of the plot or players is necessary.  I‚Äôve chosen to remove myself from the debate and do my best to ensure my own short-term future, as well as my progeny‚Äôs longer term survival. Because the future belongs to those who show up for it, and just because they‚Äôre mine and I love them.  I‚Äôd like to think I have bit more agency than history‚Äôs landless peasants who saw their villages burned and their harvests taken and their children sold as slaves.  But I try not to fool myself about my place in the food chain, or in history.Perhaps America ‚Äì both the idea and the reality ‚Äì was exceptional in some ways for its time.  At its founding, and even for some years thereafter.  And it did seem to provide land and space and opportunity for many White men ‚Äì of various European ethnicities ‚Äì to succeed due to hard work and some  intelligence, despite a heritage of poverty or lower social class.  But that‚Äôs not the famed ‚Äòarc of history.‚Äô  We‚Äôre all just flotsom and jetsam in time, ultimately.  Hopefully not after death, but that is a matter of faith and not proven fact.So  . . . just stop expecting too much.  I‚Äôm not counseling despair or defeatism, but perhaps a little more proportionality.  No, we‚Äôre really not that special, and we oughtn‚Äôt assume we‚Äôll be exceptions to the law of averages.

            ‚ÄúEven in the face of endlessly repeated irrationality and intransigence, these dupes keep imaging that THIS fact, THIS comparison, THIS appeal, will finally win through.‚ÄùThe Ashkenazi are never going to change. We know in this genomic era that their founding population was a very small number of men who took gentile wives. What happened to the Hebrew diaspora and their numerous converts to Judaism across the ancient Mediterranean? They were destroyed in 3 great wars. First, the 66-71 war Flavius Josephus documented in his ‚ÄúJewish War‚Äù that culminated in the Siege of Masada. The second is documented from primary sources in Miriam Pucci Ben Zeev‚Äôs masterful ‚ÄúDiaspora Judaism in Turmoil 116/117 CE.‚Äù The third, called the Bar-Kochba War left little archeological or literary evidence in its aftermath, except the absence of settled Jewish civilization.Those outside of Judea inserted themselves in other people‚Äôs (pre-fiat) tax intake/output systems all over the Mediterranean, angering everyone else. No one wants foreigners feeding off of their labor, especially local ruling classes who view it as THEIR prerogative to feed off of their own laboring class.If their diaspora didn‚Äôt learn from the previous disasters, which proportionally were far worse than the Holocaust, what are the chances that their diaspora are going to change their behaviors now? The civilizational who became Israelis learned the proper lesson from the Holocaust, which is that you have to have your own land for your own people with your owned armed men at the borders defending them. Our merchant-clown-trash ruling class is about to relearn this lesson, too. The diaspora like Goldman (who recently called for Pres. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòelimination‚Äô) and Schumer and the Rothschild‚Äôs and Lazard‚Äôs and Sassoon‚Äôs and Montefi-Sebiori‚Äôs and so on and so forth are not going learn and hence are not going to stop their dyscivilizational behavior until they are deported to Israel. They probably won‚Äôt stop even then, but it wouldn‚Äôt be our problem any more.

        Difficult thing, to witness the galloping deterioration of one‚Äôs functional and healthy culture.  Far more difficult to witness its intentional, gleeful dismemberment by Team Resentment.If it‚Äôs any comfort, the evil congealing on, beneath, and above this planet is unprecedented, and if you aren‚Äôt somewhat ‚Äòparanoid‚Äô by this point, please see me after class.Also for comfort, this summa of evil never again will manifest on this planet, nor anywhere else for that matter . . . not at anything like this level.Yes this is The Shit but praise God, it proliferates like proverbial tares, and quickly is hacked down and burned.  Got to let it self-assemble first, is all.After this, much more than mere good times return.  Permanent good times and no looking back.I‚Äôm a martial person so from my standpoint, these past decades were a singular and exhilarating opportunity to do what I do.

            Fighting for small government will be irrelevant until we have an ethnostate because only whites have any interest in small government.  Further, ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù is the excuse that most of the Republican presidential candidates use for allowing parents to mutilate their children in tranny surgeries.
After we have secured a homeland, some may argue for small government, but even then, this is an opening for corporations to oppress the people and for pornography, to name a few of the risks.
Until then, we must embrace fascism in the name of our tribe.

        I think you have to ask yourself which part of the regime thinks we‚Äôre on thin ice.  D.C. is the ID of the regime, completely emotive, seeking retribution.

            Now that you mention it‚Ä¶‚ÄúWhere id was, there shall ego be.‚Äù Freud as Constitutionalist. It is the missing part of the current regime‚Äîrational self-awareness. But is it the only missing part?In an inversion of Freud, the regime id is always on proud public display, from Nuland and Schumer down to the local school troons giving porn to kids‚Äîand the local cops punching MAGA grannies for objecting to any of it. They hate you and hurt you and there‚Äôs nothing else to it.Meanwhile its superego is a totally hidden thing, a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù or whatever, that we presume exists because the regime can‚Äôt possibly be as stupid and insane as it *always* acts like it is. It‚Äôs not Gates and Soros and Schwab. They barely qualify as ‚Äúmidwits.‚Äù It‚Äôs only by accident of birth that they don‚Äôt all work in shoe stores. There must be something more, someone else, a plan that does more than satisfy our rulers‚Äô animal urges and will to (our) destruction.Or not. Maybe, like when you‚Äôre already half eaten by a shark, human analogies aren‚Äôt helpful.

        The Long March through the institutions is finally over. They‚Äôve all fallen, and nothing works because nothing CAN work like this. The wheels are coming off. The kooks see it, the normies see it, and now the denizens of The Establishment see it. The ‚ÄòKraine is a disaster. The idea was to gut Russia and steal their wealth, and now they are stronger and wealthier than ever before. The entire Arab world is now signing up with the BRICS and hasn‚Äôt the time of day for America. Or Israel‚Ä¶ but I repeat myself, if ya catch my drift.The other day I was as sick as a dog watching ‚ÄòFrom The Front Lines‚Äô on Netflix. Everything was colourized and digitally re-mastered for spectacular visuals. I just watched the scenes of WW2, ignoring the narratives and historical revisions and inaccuracies. You see the gaunt, drawn women as they go about their business, worried sick about their men and boys at war. The urgency and trembling hands as starving kids snatch crackers and bread from soldiers and Red Cross workers. The leaders and generals were serious men seriously trying to protect their people in a dire world.Then I consider men like Justin Turdo‚Ä¶ Biden‚Ä¶ the legions of other clowns like Lindsay Graham, Mitch McConnell, AOC and ‚ÄòThe Squad‚Äô‚Ä¶Pardon my fwench‚Ä¶ but we are so fucked. History is going to repeat but with far, far more emphasis this time.

        The people we call the ‚Äúleft‚Äù were already kinda crazy before 2016. But 2016 induced in them a mass psychotic break, and they can‚Äôt turn it off. We call this Clown World. At least 90% of what are thought to be problems caused by the Orange Man are in truth the fruits of this psychotic break.For the last week or so it has been all over my news feed that the Orange Man will govern as a ‚Äúdictator‚Äù and will ‚Äúend democracy.‚Äù If you really believed that, and if those words inspired the fear in you that they were supposed to inspire, then wouldn‚Äôt you have a moral obligation to (at a minimum) steal the election?Another one of those big tells about election theft, a dog that didn‚Äôt bark, is the celebrity status (or in this case, lack thereof) of the victorious campaign manager. This used to be a standard thing. Atwater, Carville, Rove, Axelrod, Bannon, Conway all became political celebrities for being successful campaign managers/strategists. Now tell me who Biden‚Äôs campaign manager was.

            I‚Äôm gonna elaborate on that first paragraph:‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù was already dead in 2016, before the election, because for ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù to work, there have to be civic minded people who are willing and able to respect the results of elections that they lose. And the ‚Äúleft‚Äù was already gone on this point, although nobody really knew it yet.They were on the broad highway to their inevitable progressive future, the deplorables had been vanquished and were only diminishing in numbers and influence, She was inevitable, and the end of history was nigh. They‚Äôd won. Forever. This was their belief, growing and building through the years of the reign of The Precious, the coronation was imminent‚Ä¶.. and then it was all ripped away, suddenly, violently, without any warning, late one evening in November 2016. This shock cannot be overstated. This is when the mass psychotic break happened, and why.Everything (politically) that has happened since has been the result of their inability to accept the results of that election. It is the supreme irony that these people going on about the sanctity of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù are the ones who are incapable of living in one.

            I am sure you will agree, Ostei, the passage of Jacob Javits‚Äôs Hart-Cellar immigration act in 1965 was the nuclear bomb that everyone ignored, as they basked in the self-congratulatory glow of the Civil Rights Act‚Äôs approval and saw fit to go one better, some for purposes of replacing traditional Americans.  Hart-Cellar was the birth announcement heralding the arrival of the grillers as well as the stirrings of cultural Marxism, giving that other soul-crushing Marxism that wants 95% of what you earn a real run for its money.

                        1913 was a very, very bad year. First, the 16th Amendment authorizing a Federal income tax meant that all those gainfully employed were now  forced to pull the plow of securing the ‚Äúfull faith and credit‚Äù of Lincoln‚Äôs gradually awakening Leviathan, invoked in his ‚ÄúSecond Founding‚Äù put forth in the Gettysburg Address, by means of which the Constitutional Republic was executed. There was to be a unitary State and no longer a Republic comprised of distinct States with their own agency. Hypothetically, the 9th and 10th Amendments still parsimoniously reserved agency for the States, but in such little detail that that agency was ripe for the picking by some sanctimonious soul (or souls), and Lincoln and later the Radical ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù functionally nullified both Amendments through their subsequent actions.And then the 17th Amendment, ratified in 1913, stripped the right of the now moribund States‚Äô legislatures  to appoint their Federal Senators.In both cases, lying got the job done: 1) With the 16th it was said that the rate would only be 1-2%; with the 17th, it was supposed to clean up corruption of the political process. Egregious lies in both cases, no?Couple these with the Federal Reserve Act, the enactment of which transferred control of the currency away from Political Economy, to a private cartel of transnationalbankers. Guess what transnationalbankers love; wars and debt slavery. Do you doubt this? What happened in 1914?This past was prologue‚Ä¶

                Let me guess. You have never actually read Hart-Cellar, have you? It‚Äôs not very long, quite a bit shorter than ZMan‚Äôs essay here, and says nothing remotely like what you seem to think it says.The problem is, was, and ever shall be that Leftist s are never content to apply any ‚Äúlaw‚Äù as written, and de facto replace it with what they want. Which is particularly dangerous when those same Leftists are TPTB.There‚Äôs no reason you have to have an informed opinion. Plenty of those out there, so you are in good company. And per ZMan‚Äôs current essay, I mention this simply because I think there‚Äôs a chance there exists a literate commenter or four who will bother to read and understand the problem we face, rather than mindlessly repeating shibboleths.

                        Of course ‚Äúit‚Äù was transformational. But for the same exact reason as every new BATFE regulation issued that is supposedly covered by NFA ‚Äô34 and GCA ‚Äô68, or the Clean Air Act applies to CO2, or the Clean Water Act applies to the puddles in your back yard after a rainstorm. The bureaucracy and judiciary pervert the plain meaning of the language into something that fits their agenda. And CONservatives then were no more effective than CONservatives now. Commies gonna commie, so you can‚Äôt really blame them. It‚Äôs the useless opposition who are to blame.H-C itself authorizes only 170,000 visas per year. Not citizenship, visas. And most of those visas for family connections apply to only unmarried sons and daughters of either US Citizens or (largely) Green Card holders. They would have to pursue naturalization on their own. There is no such thing as an ‚Äúanchor baby‚Äù in H-C, for instance. That was completely made up by the commie scum. Same with uncles, cousins, parents, grandparents etc. Mayorkis and his ilk can‚Äôt suffer a painful enough death that I would feel any sympathy.

                    It abolished the National Origins Formula, Steve, which had successfully promoted European immigration for decades, thus opening the door, whether then or later, for Third World hordes. People a lot smarter than you and me figured this out in 1965, including my mother, a beautiful 26-year-old housewife and Goldwater supporter in a rural town, whose razor-sharp intellect and political instincts picked up on the implications despite the unicorns and pink confetti spin I‚Äôm sure the CIA-controlled media put on the abomination.

                        I know that was argued, even while the bill was under consideration. But there were roughly 4 million live births at the time, and even if every visa authorized by H-C when to people from the same 3rd world country, and all of them were granted citizenship, that‚Äôs a mere 4% of the population growth. And remember, visas, not citizenship. The Democrats were correct that would have a negligible effect.Of course, that was before native birth rates halved‚Ä¶H-C was not to blame. If you want to place blame, I‚Äôd split it between relaxation of citizenship standards and elimination of the requirement that immigrants have sponsors legally responsible for them not becoming a burden.

                        Yes, it was argued.  And those who argued it were correct as to what it would lead to.  White womyn refusing to have children was jet fuel to the current demographics nightmare, and probably quite the pleasant surprise to the powers behind the Hart-Cellar throne.

            In hindsight, the 60s hippies were RIGHT about 2 things, which are basically the same thing:
1)  MIC is very, *very* real.  Fucking ‚ÄòNam killed a lot of good boys for nothing.2)  Advertising and TV programming are total, utter, premeditated brainwashing.

                The hippies don‚Äôt get as much credit as you think. Remember, it was Eisenhower, a West Point grad and a career officer who told us to ‚Äúbeware of the military-industrial complex‚Äù and refused to get us into Vietnam.
Interesting historical factoid: Every general who became president served two terms with no wars ‚Äî Washington, Jackson, Grant, Eisenhower.
But nearly every major war we have been in (Civil War, World War I, World War II, and Vietnam) the commanders-in-chief (Lincoln, Wilson, FDR, Johnson) had zero or little military experience.

            Anytime I‚Äôm asked about the election I say some variation of this, usually mentioning that he‚Äôs even more popular than obama. I say this in the most deadpan way possible &amp; I‚Äôve done this many times now.What‚Äôs interesting is that not once has the person I‚Äôve said this to actually taken me seriously regardless of their political affiliation. The people who think the election was stolen will typically laugh at me saying that but the pro biden types always doubt my sincerity &amp; get agitated.If the election wasn‚Äôt stolen then I‚Äôm just stating a simple &amp; totally uncontroversial fact yet not even the people who claim that statement is true seem to believe it nor do they accept that anyone else does.

        Honestly, the best thing that can happen is for the Elites, once again, to steal the upcoming election in an open, brazen, in-your-face, FU fashion and cram the results down everyone‚Äôs throats with a toilet plunger handle. In doing so, Dan Bongino‚Äôs head will explode and the re-animated corpse will then start advocating for the 2028 ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get em next time‚Äù election.No matter who is in office, 2025 will become the Year of Living Dangerously. The models are clear. The financial house-of-cards starts its collapse no latter than mid-year when the Treasury prints fiat like nobody‚Äôs business and hyper-inflation ushers in a deep recession/depression. Then, and only then, does normie get off the couch. The playbook says they will nurture extreme civic violence everywhere in order to justify a tyranny crackdown. The Jackboots will start rounding up the usual suspects while Southern states start serious secession movements. As in Ukraine, there will be a lotta manufactured dead white guys associated with militias.The moral of this story. Drones changed the game in Ukraine and it can happen here too. If you care about protecting innocents; focus, focus, focus.

                    What will probably happen:When the suburbs burb because of diversity, the white suburbs beg the government (the one that caused the problem) to protect them. Token protection will be afforded. Whitey will cling to this and beg for more.When the bellies rumble, the whites will be forced to comply with new rules in order to receive a weekly ration. This will appeal to the soft authoritarianism of our elites (e.g. You don‚Äôt have to get your daily covid vaccine or worship at the altar of diversity, but you will not get food). Blacks will be directed to the nearest suburb (see point one).When the few rebels are crushed, the media will label the ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù as white supremacists. The whites will do anything to distance themselves from this (see point 2), and the diverse will see this as the justification to terrorize whitey (see point 1).Normalcy bias is real.

A lot of thought about how things can be insane and yet not explode. Best I can come up with is there‚Äôs no rival elite. Factions within the elite, sure, but they don‚Äôt disagree enough for revolutionary potential‚Äî the will to separate just isn‚Äôt there.

            I‚Äôve been hearing about imminent hyperinflation for like 40 years.  I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not possible or that it will never happen, but predicting hyperinflation in 18 months does not have a very accurate history.
Also, from what I understand, there are a ton of deflationary forces pent up in the system.  The bank runs earlier this year being a prime example.

                What is hyperinflation?  50%, 100%, more?  At least two thirds of the working population live paycheck to paycheck.  5 years of say 10% will sink most everybody.  That, and consider that those inflation numbers are already massaged as to their effect on the common man in the street.  We don‚Äôt need hyperinflation ala Argentina when we are in a debt/death spiral even today.  The populace is not the same as during the Great Depression.  They will not set up camps and make due while they wait it out.

                    The thing is, AFAIK, all the debt defaults are deflationary.  Every debt is recorded as an asset on someone‚Äôs books.  The process of debt default is self-reinforcing, again, AFAIK.  When one person has someone else‚Äô debt as an asset, when that debt is defaulted, his asset goes down or disappears and so any debt he has is harder to service and goes in default causing the next debt default by his creditors.We‚Äôve had 80 plus years of inflation largely by issuing debt.If the US were to default on its debt, there would be a worldwide shortage of Dollars and a lot of international contracts could not be settled as they are denominated in Dollars.My understanding of this could be completely wrong though.  There is also always the risk the government and fed will try to print all the debt to keep the creditors whole, like they did earlier this year with the banks.

                        My understanding is limited as well‚Äîas Citizen often reminds me.  I simply look at prices I pay in the marketplace, have bit of understanding of how good I have it (and therefore how bad others have it) and extrapolate from there.I‚Äôve heard deflation is more feared than inflation, but what do I know.  Inflation seems for the common person with little reserves to definitely be a killer.  I‚Äôve also been told that many are surviving in a fools paradise vis a vis credit card use.  In any event, when folks are dead broke and are desperate, they become pawns.  That is the fear I have.

                        There is a fly in the ointment. While that particular transaction would be deflationary, whatever debt service the former debt-holder was paying will now be inflationary, unless he stuffs the cash under his mattress.
We have enough evidence from CoVid that it‚Äôs pretty unlikely all that cash will just stay out of circulation.

                Forbes defines hyperinflation as greater than 14% per annum. And its the sustained compounding over several years that kills you. You can‚Äôt grow your way out of a crisis when inflation gets this high. Default becomes inevitable because of the sheer size of our sovereign debt. Some economists believe that you can weather this storm with a CBDC and raiding 401Ks, but the models predict a major societal upheaval before that could ever get off the ground. Start a garden as soon as you can.

                    Inflation (at least moderate inflation) favors debtors. You pay off debt with increasingly less valuable money. Deflation does the opposite. You pay back debt with increasingly valuable money. The old 19th century gold standard days were deflationary, with several depressions (called panics in those days) because of a shortage of currency. New gold strikes would temporarily relieve the shortage but then it was back to deflation. Eventually, the economic seesaw became too much even for the creditor class and we got the Federal Reserve System, with the creditor class in charge of the new inflationary system, which was always available to bail them out. There were some hiccups in the system as when in the early days of the Great Depression when the Feds panicked and cu the supply of money, which sent the economy back into depression and then again in the late 30s when they did it again. Since then we have not repeated anything so severe as the GD but we have had an inflationary spiral that has eaten away at the average Joe but left the economic elite unscathed. You might call it a Great Depression in slow motion, with large numbers a few paychecks away from living with mom &amp;dad (if they‚Äôre lucky).

            Since I was a child I have heard the following refrain, ‚Äúthere is no revolution until people are starving.

                There are many models which have been developed and are currently being utilized by both public and private entities; including dozens within the Federal Government alone. Some are specialized, but a large and growing cohort are macro-scale and, as with Chat GPT and Gemini, draw upon enormous Federal and State resources augmented by internet-scavenged databases. Universities have also been engaged in a significant way since the early 1980s. And this reality has been repeated within most countries on the planet; China in particular is a huge player and benefits from a large and relatively homogeneous population resource to model.And some models are proprietary and closely held. For good reason.

        &gt; In many of these cases, the judge, as a part of the punishment, makes the accused say in open court that he now believes Biden won fair and square.This is the sickest part of all. It‚Äôs nothing new either. People going to jail have often said how sorry they were they killed, robbed, etc. someone to get a more lenient sentence. A lot of times, it will come back later these people were totally innocent.There‚Äôs no reason why a sentence‚Äôs severity should depend on a public admittance of guilt and the entire humiliation ritual associated with it.

            ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just for the judge and prosecutor getting off on destroying someone, not justice.‚Äù
Personal experience has led to the conclusion that in your typical litigious dynamic (prosecutor/plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, judge) there is at least one person there (can be any of the players) who is going to get off on twisting a knife when it is totally unneeded and throw some sort of personal vendetta into the process when its completely unnecessary. So yes, absolutely correct.

            Our system isn‚Äôt designed to prove innocence. Not guilty just means the state failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt1. ‚ÄúLots of times ‚Ä¶ totally innocent‚Äù is just an absurd remark. The statistics to support such a claim don‚Äôt exist.2. When a defendant is found guilty, the prosecutor cannot argue that he or she should be punished more severely for exercising the Constitutional right to a trial; so instead, they argue a lack of remorse that indicates the defendant is incapable of reform. It‚Äôs the defendants who whine and grovel and minimize their behavior by appealing to addictions or childhood abuse. If you want to avoid this mockery of justice, then support uniform application of draconian sentences like the Three Strikes law. No one should blink if a recidivist is convicted of his third felony and then imprisoned for 25 to life. The ‚Äúhumiliation ritual‚Äù would be completely unnecessary.As an aside, and just to be clear, the injustice to the J6 arrestees occurred long before their trials. They should never have been charged or held to answer for their actions. But you cannot have martyrs without humiliation and bloodshed; and that‚Äôs what the GAE created, whether intended or not.

        The old Chinese proverb ‚Äì ‚ÄúKill the chicken to frighten the monkey‚Äù ‚Äì applies here. This is just ritual intimidation of opponents. I think it says a lot about the increasingly totalitarian tactics of the people in charge.So what has changed? Well, the Government is now a gigantic global enterprise. The insiders are getting really rich ‚Äì Wall Street type rich ‚Äì on the spoils. There‚Äôs way more money to fight over.Truman/Dewey, Kennedy/Nixon and even Bush/Gore election trickery could be settled by the Uniparty under the Marquis of Queensbury rules. We‚Äôre now way beyond all that ‚Äì it‚Äôs a business, not a republic. The Annual Shareholders‚Äô Meeting isn‚Äôt going to be disrupted by some peasant storming the dais waving his one-share proxy.

        The thing about the overreaction to J6 that always struck me as odd is how obviously most of the people involved in the riot were just harmless clowns and cranks, and yet the Establishment was trying to gaslight us into thinking it was an ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù to ‚Äúoverthrow the government‚Äù and hunted these people down and prosecuted them accordingly.In fact, the only shot that was fired was fired by the Negro cop when he killed the unarmed white Ashli Babbit.Yes, there were a handful of people who caused property damage and should have been arrested for that, but most of them were like the buffalo horn ‚Äúshaman‚Äù and the redneck from Arkansas who put his feet up on Pelosi‚Äôs desk. They were more like high school pranksters than insurrectionists ‚Äî but they went to prison for it. The chick lawyer with the ‚Äúkraken‚Äù nonsense was also a nut.The Left-wing nutjobs have done far, far worse things with zero consequences. The BLM criminals who committed arson in Atlanta got a $500 fine and probation. It seems to me that the J6 stuff is more a Rorschach test for the mentally-unbalanced Regime onto which they projected their own neuroses.

        These people are drunk on power and simultaneously scared to death their farcical system is about to collapse. It emerged over the weekend that Uncle Lloyd Austin of the Deepartmin‚Äô of De-fence threatened senators in a closed-door meeting that he would ship their sons, brothers and cousins to die in a war with Russia unless they shipped $60 billion to ‚ÄúUkraine.‚Äù Ol‚Äô marse Ray-fee-on is a hungry god. Simultaneously, Republicans want to increase warrantless spying on their voters because they might have bad thoughts about the people they elect.The Regime rules by raw force now and will continue to do so as long as it can. The public sees an open border, rampant corruption and stolen elections and tolerates all this as long as it is fed and warm. When the day arrives that they no longer have these comforts, that dynamic changes. The rest of the world is moving past the United States and the people within the Banana Empire are starting to do so mentally even with full bellies. Fragmentation and dissolution will accelerate on its own accord.

            Hmmm‚Ä¶quick google gave a few tidbits. Judging by Google News, which gives no mention of his death, Mr. Vandaelle was doing his thing (business journalism) as recently as one month past. By late November he was in hospice for unspecified reasons and a few weeks later, dead. Happens all the time to 33-year-old men. Nothing to see here folks, please move along.

        I also sense that ‚Äúregime awareness‚Äù, the realization that the system is increasingly illegitimate, is slowly going mainstream. And the regime may also sense that, adding fuel to their paranoia. The first faint scent of their blood is enticing. If their fears are justified it shall be a White Xmas indeed

            I think they ran Bernie and Trump in 2016 to see how much the Obama Magic was still working.  The Democrats shived Bernie with ease, Trump was the golem that broke loose.  The kind of person who even if he knew it was a joke, could sense the energy and tried to hijack it.  Everything the two of them talked about in 2016 had been building since 2008.  It was almost like Trump had been reading everything i had since 2008 and made that his platform.  Did i i think he would actually do any of it?  Hell no, but they are paying attention.

            Ron DeSantis, for all his cuckiness, used the word ‚Äúregime‚Äù a few months back. Regime awareness is definitely going mainstream.A big whitepill for me is that all the censorship from 2017 to 2022 has not killed the New Right or Dissident Right. As predicted, the censorship has only made it stronger and sharper. And the people who pushed through are getting traction again, thanks to Gab and Rumble and Elon, even still YouTube, and are apparently moving the political class as you see with Blake Masters, Matt Gaetz, Thomas Massie, and King Cobra. Not a whole lot of people so far, but I think many more will be sympathetic to New Right if not Dissident Right in the coming years.Leftism peaked in 2020 and is about to face a serious backlash.

                    There is a solid right-wing movement afoot that celebrates the ‚Äúalpha‚Äù or the Chad. Almost every young RW influencer (hell, almost every centrist Roganeque influencer) has got to have muscle mass to be taken seriously. Even the religious right. Homesteading, fighting, and butchering hogs is cool now. And fighting against ‚Äúthe man‚Äù has always been cool. Luckily for us, ‚Äúthe man‚Äù is the Left in general.

        The two greatest ironies of the 2020 election are to be found in the contradictory behaviors of the adherents to the respective parties. As Z points out, Democrats who say the election was the cleanest and most legitimate election ever keep returning to the subject like an arsonist to the site of a burned-out building. Meanwhile, Republicans who claim the election was obviously stolen‚Äîmost notably Trump himself‚Äîare innocently looking forward to the next election as if they had every chance of winning, although states (even Republican-controlled ones) have done almost nothing to shore up confidence in the system.

            The show must go on.But it is useful to illustrate that while the perpetual anti-reality machine is most certainly not self-sustaining, there remains a very real part of anti-reality that we must contend with.My wife may feel very strongly about something. That something may not exist or it may in some fraction, but what exists without a doubt is that she feels.Even more so, often it is ‚Äúnot about the nail‚Äù. But these thoughts and feelings are real as they manifest in our shared reality. And so ‚Äúher reality‚Äù becomes in some part ‚Äúmy reality‚Äù to deal with.Luckily she is a squared away lady and these are on the margin, rare and innocuous. But we are awash in a culture in which this condition is widespread, highly contagious, volatile, and increasingly detached from reality.The umbilical between is stretched to its max.It seems that in addition to wars and war machines and pron and social media ‚Äútech‚Äù the liberal democracy of the globo progressive west manufactures and awful lot of cogdis. Luckily we have pharma.Now take your soma comrade.  These are very unhealthy thoughts. You wouldn‚Äôt want your thoughts to become actual things too. That would be problematic.

                Yes.  The propaganda has worked and it manifests in many ways subtle and unsubtle.   It seems to me though that because they have used it so much in the last few years the formula is becoming weaker.  This is a slow process though.We see evidence of this with the attempt to start the war with Iran.  Many, at least more than previously, see this for what it is, the use of Israel being attacked to try and start their much desired war in the middle east.   The most advanced and less influenced see that the whole thing was set up to enable an attack on Iran and a wider war in the middle east.Imagine the cabal‚Äôs horror at finding out that many can see through their BS, and worse, their decades of carefully shaping the public‚Äôs opinion and sympathies for Jews is weakening.

            ‚Äú Is there a bridge too far, even for White Americans?‚ÄùThey‚Äôve got that covered as well.  Boomers (77M cohort) are gone in twenty years.  Until then, there is open borders.  Latest from one sector, my sector, the Tucson sector:  Influx rate‚Äîjust here, *one* sector‚Äî1M per year current rate.   Tucson and the surrounding urban area is itself about one million residents.  Imagine the influx if we didn‚Äôt ship them out to the rest of the US, we‚Äôd double our population in a year!MX influx, a little over 50%.  OTM (other than MX) now having significant increase of Africans, Chinese, and Middle East. However, whereas the MX are bringing families or reuniting with family here, OTM‚Äôs are primarily single, younger males of military and reproductive age.Lukeville entry port closed due to BP lack of staff.  Cartels then actually brought heavy equipment and cut through border wall at Lukeville to expedite the mass of IA‚Äôs waiting for entry into US from MX.  The remaining BP was told to stand down and watch.  Plenty of video, but I bet you never saw one!Note that the border wall is *not* built upon the national boundary line, but several hundred yards within US territory.  The military could easily use force to stop such blatant intrusion onto sovereign territory.   And so it goes‚Ä¶

            They may appear to get away with it, but like most bloody revolutions, the real trigger will be something no-one expected. Look at Ceaucescu. He was making his usual speech and suddenly a few guys at the back started hurling insults. The rest is history.  The psychopaths are really rubbing our noses in it right now, and there is almost certainly going to be some spark that sets things off.

        Stochastic terrorism holds that if some act is attributed to speech‚Äîa song, a movie, whatever‚Äîthe speaker can be held accountable for the actions of the perpetrator. Because it also includes a clause for ‚Äúcoded language,‚Äù we can rightfully assume that Paul McCartney should be behind bars. Sure, when he wrote Helter Skelter, he  supposedly intended it to be about a tilt-a-whirl ride at the fairgrounds. But Charles Manson saw through the fa√ßade‚Äîthe code, in the language of the song‚Äîand realized it was actually about a race war that he would initiate by killing some celebrities and blaming the Black Panthers or other black radicals. Salinger‚Äôs estate probably also owes Yoko Ono money since Mark David Chapman saw the code in ‚ÄúCatcher in the Rye‚Äù that told him to shoot John Lennon.The funniest part of the Trump fiasco is that he cited Jimmy Carter‚Äôs forensic postmortem of the 2000 election in his case. Carter found that absentee balloting was incredible pervious to fraud. Older Boomers and some of their kids still think the Peanut Farmer got a raw deal, and that Gore got robbed in 2000. They‚Äôll resolve the internal inconsistencies of Trump pointing to that by smoothing their cognitive dissonance into double think, but then you can bring up BLM and freeing Palestine and watch them start squirming all over again. I‚Äôve said it before but I‚Äôll say it again, their fulminating and jumping up and down like Yosemite Sam and demanding I care about everything from Ukraine to Our Democracy (TM) makes me want to make a blender of pi√±a coladas, sit back, smile and enjoy some time off. Let the miserable mothers tear each other apart for awhile. This domestic terrorist white supremacist is going to do something really sinister, like enjoying a bowl of ice cream and then walking my dog.

            Other ‚Äúobvious fraud‚Äù cues:
1. Taking days, or weeks to count ballots.
2. Having voting systems that are literally non auditable by design.
Japan went back to paper ballots because of this. They have results the same day, and can repeat the counted results in short order, over and over again.
(The real crime isn‚Äôt the mechanics of voting though; it‚Äôs the mass collusion between government and media.)
Voting in America is just stupid.

                The real crime isn‚Äôt the mechanics of voting though; it‚Äôs the mass collusion between government and media.‚ÄîReminds me how I‚Äôve brought before how secure Australia‚Äôs elections are (paper ballots, counted on camera and verified on-site by multiple parties), and yet they may have kookiest politicians in the Anglosphere.  The strange thing indeed is why the regime even feels compelled at all to steal elections when process is cooked from beginning to end anyway.

            Tucker, after Trump‚Äôs election, liked to go into his ‚Äúanything is possible in this timeline,‚Äù spiel. Whenever I encounter eyerolls or get the conspiracy theory treatment, I like to remind the supposedly sober-minded prog (it is to laugh) that we discovered a wealthy member of the ruling class had a private island where he was intent on creating some kind of Island of Dr. Moreau-like super-race by broadcasting his seed to underage girls. Everyone from Bill Clinton to Bill Gates to their favorite Orange Hitler knew the man. And then he commits suicide in a jail cell while the camera just happens to malfunction? Or how about some crooked politician‚Äôs son who films and documents his dealings on behalf of foreign nationals and prostitutes, then forgets his laptop at a repair shop? Write a thriller about that and you‚Äôd be laughed out of the publisher‚Äôs office for being lazy and too improbable in your plotlines. What *isn‚Äôt* possible in such a world? I‚Äôm starting to think David Icke might have the Roddie Piper sunglasses after all. The only reason to watch C-Span at this point is to see if you catch a politician‚Äôs eyes nictitating as they watch a fly pass their face and try not to snatch it up with their forked tongue.
