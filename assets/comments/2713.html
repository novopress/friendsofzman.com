        “Perhaps it is time to leave black institutions to black ownership”
Like the once-rich, thriving city of Detroit, you mean?  How did that work out after “black ownership” took over?  As they say, you can take the man out of the ‘hood, but not the ‘hood out of the man.

        Then will cries and alarums arise, “Hockey is segregated! NASCAR is segregated! The Bakersfield Sound was stolen from black people! Somebodydosomething!” You can’t win, Dutch. You’re not supposed to win, you and your calm reason.

        Perhaps it is time to leave black institutions (NBA, NFL, much of the music biz) to black ownership. We white guys still have hockey, NASCAR and country music. Self-segregation is not evil, it is simply what many people choose to do.

        I find it very sad and troubling that the Cult is getting away with accusing / convicting people of racism and non-PC even though all they did was speak the truth.
Truth used to mostly trump the BS in America.
