        Williamson is impersonating a rational human.He lost me when he wrote that putrid rant stigmatizing southern white trailer trash a couple years ago.It was thoroughly deplorable piece of true bigotry dressed up as pinky in the air ruling class charity.The lyin’ bastard wrote it as if he traveled through those hollows and ridges in Appalachia like he was telling a story from being in a foreign country while in the peace corps himself.I know, I live in those hollows and ridges. I could see where he lied outright about the people and culture. If you didn’t live there you would never know. I called the useless puke out on it, and he had the gaul to respond with more lies.The commenters on his post handed him his arse for writing what he did, and he backpedaled like a drowning man while dissimulating as cunningly as if his last name began with an O.He is no different than the liars who run the legacy media.If anything, he is worse, because he is an impostor who has a lot of people fooled he is a “conservative journalist” of sorts.His job is to slant a meme and distort the truth just enough to fool and mislead peoples perceptions.A very destructive and sinister man he is.Funny, he is a mulato skinned man like another infamous usurper liar.

        I believe most people have some real understanding of how all this works out.  Like the household that is completely financially overextended, it becomes a game of “grab what you can, while you can”, and hope that divine intervention, dumb luck, or what have you will bail us all out.  Hence the union games, the pension games, the hedge fund games, etc, etc.  All various ways to pick the carcass clean before the comeuppance.

        3 options:1) rates go up. everybody goes bankrupt. economy collapses.2) rates stay at zero. everybody stops rolling over debt. economy collapses.3) rates go negative. economy in uncharted territory.
3 is the only option left to try. which is why they’re floating the idea of outlawing cash.

            The only real questions left are how negative and for how long. We’re near the point where they may just ban keeping pocket change as that’s the only way to reach the velocity levels they need to keep the plates spinning.

                The insanity of it all is they will never relinquish an iota of power to meddle. If anything, they will behave and act in ever more desperation as power to control dissipates in direct relation to their desperation to maintain the illusion of legitimacy.It seems like power which is being employed ever more towards greater centralization, at an ever increasing, increasing rate.I always loved this definition of the old Soviet Nomenklaturer,“An administrative corporate underclass of the ruling elite, which controlled every facet in the sphere of the lives of the people”.Makes sense to me as the Constitution is essentially, with the exception of the 1st and 2nd Amendments, an instrument of administrative law, or in impolite terms, an instrument of administrative tyranny.Does it look like to any of you all, like it does to me?Akin to a building implosion, like a political version of the big bang theory. At some point, the center can not contain what it has sowed, and it implodes, then explodes as per the law of physics regarding equal and opposite reaction?The deeper we go down the rabbit hole, the more it becomes apparent the hole is so deep, there is no redress through accepted and traditional economic, political and social means. Probably peaceful means either, when the productive half of this country is basically classified as domestic terrorist bitter clingers.Is it revolutionary to suggest, for any chance of redemption in this world gone total retard bonkers insane, it may be the best thing it all burns, and enough people survive through it to start off new again, to before that instrument of administrative tyranny was ratified, and something similar to the compact of confederation of various territories, the nation states the people of each created in desire for abolition of the state of the time King George’s economic and administrative tyranny, as signatories of The Articles of Confederation, in 1777?I mean, they had a good thing going when they signed The Declaration of Independence.That was the whole idea, secession from slavery of the state.Right?It just makes such common sense. If you can’t fix the tyranny of the state, secede from it. It is the greatest act of withdrawal of consent, and recognition of the illegitimate nature of those who usurp power. Nothing can be worse than the tyranny breathing down our necks.Had a craw full of the mutation of self determination and liberty is something those running things pay lip service to, as long dead white guys, only to be trotted out to garner votes in a useless process long bereft of integrity and value.

        I think that what happened, Z, is that in the 70s we abandoned any pretense of a specie-backed currency and moved to fiat money. It took the banksters and politicos about a decade to figure out to game the new system.I’m not a knee jerk anti-fiat money kind of guy. It has some good qualities and bad qualities. But responsible bankers and legislators (I know… that’s like believing in unicorns and leprechauns) really haven’t figured out how to regulate it yet.  Of course, that leads us right to what I think is your central theme: what is conservatism and why is it important to proceed conservatively.

        And so what happens when interest rates eventually go up, which they will? Of course, we don’t know when this will happen, but history says that rates have been so low for so long that they must rise soon. The State has benefited greatly from the low-interest rate financialization of the economy, but no tree grows to the sky. It will be obvious to everyone, when rates rise high enough, that the debt is not serviceable, nor will it be repayable. That’s when things get interesting.

        Niall Ferguson’s speech and presentation on Fiscal Crises and Imperial Collapsesathttp://www.iie.com/events/event_detail.cfm?EventID=152The powerpoint is quite good if you don’t have time for the video or dislike an historian speaking like Sean Connery.

I find the arithmetic compelling even granting that there is no way to foresee the trigger or time the trade.
