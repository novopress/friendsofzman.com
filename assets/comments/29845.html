        Alas you missed the firing reason I like best; Rupert had him fired ‚Äôcause his fiance called Tucker a messenger from God so of course  he had to axe him and ex her. üòâ

                If it were my job to defame all three parties without seeming guilty of favoring any of them, I‚Äôd consider it a good compromise. Read it as if you‚Äôre the average social-media lib. It would reassure you that you were already right to hate them all before you heard the story. Tucker and the ex are crazy Jeezo-morons, and Murdoch‚Äîthough superior to the others because he has the power to punish them and used it‚Äîis fundamentally soulless, as the other channels/papers have always said he is. Crafty.

                Interesting.  Couple weeks ago, I was at a military vendor show at the range.  On the table before me was a half dozen or so new model AR pattern rifles in ‚Äù6.5mm‚Äù with suppressors.  These were the new Special Forces equipment now being issued.The ex SEAL manning that table was well versed.  We discussed just how long the military was evaluating alternative calibers to the 5.56.  I had read white papers after the Somalia debacle, which this guy was aware of.  Seems he had experience shooting ‚Äúskinnies‚Äù and seeing them get back up as his vehicle passed by.  üôÅAs the Special Forces go, soon will the services.  So the lesson to be learned I guess is to only shoot fat people and if not, head shots.

        I‚Äôve been seriously wondering lately whether the settlement Fox made with Dominion was a campaign contribution.  For many many years it‚Äôs been typical for government bureaucrats that want to give money to some left-wing cause to encourage someone to sue them.  They can‚Äôt give the money to the cause directly, but they can surrender to some kind of legal settlement in court and cut them a check that way.Fox is a publicly traded company so they can‚Äôt just donate millions to ‚Äúfortification‚Äù efforts, but maybe the Murdochs told the lawyers to settle this particular lawsuit so they could funnel the company‚Äôs money into the NeverTrump cause.  This would come with the added bonus of giving them an excuse to fire anyone they wanted to get rid of anyway.

            I think that is a big part of what BLM is. Corps and individuals are capped on campaign contributions. However, you can launder the money through BLM and a lot more money makes it back into the DNC ‚Äì and it is tax deductible.

            Something is rotten with that settlement.  I‚Äôve seen various reports of Dominion‚Äôs yearly revenue and most are in the range of $17-$23 million with one outlier at $40 million.  Fox does not have morons for lawyers, they wouldn‚Äôt settle a case for $800 million when they could just buy the company for a fraction of the amount.  And the threaten them with some Alex Jones verdict angle doesn‚Äôt add up either.  Fox can hire an entire mobbed up DC firm that absolutely would not let that happen.Z said after the Alec Baldwin on set shooting, I‚Äôm going to assume it was premeditated murder until I see irrefutable evidence otherwise.  In that vein, I‚Äôm going to assume the public statements about this settlement are some kind of lie until I see the signed agreement or an SEC filing showing the payment.

            It‚Äôs always been the case that the executives of a company are bound by law to act in the financial interests of the shareholders. I‚Äôm sure this is one of the many things that the gynocratic hive mind intends to do away with. It will meet the same fate as freedom of speech and association, property and gun rights, the right to self-defense, and all those other pesky laws and traditions that recognize that people are separate from each other and that some are more capable or more deserving than others.The Great Mother does not acknowledge that those who own stock in a retail store may have interests that are at odds with, say, the guy who wants to break into that store and walk back to his car with a flat-screen. There are no petty individual interests allowed in Gynamerica. Only the Hive has any valid interests and the Hive is never against itself.Except that it is ‚Äì all the time, especially when the hive members are stupid and can barely understand each other because they don‚Äôt even speak a common language. Maybe once all the multiracial bees are done looting everything from each other someone will remember why businesses were expected to turn a profit and the executives weren‚Äôt allowed to just blow the company‚Äôs money on boutique virtue signalling causes, or just coke and hookers for that matter.

        The Regime is clamping down. The NYT story is for the armies of young Fetterman voters. Say he had racist texts because he mentioned white men and they nod and mark Tucker for a spot in the ditch and permanently associate anyone mentioning white advocacy with the horrible devil Carlson.Carlson and Bongino will be the further ghettoizing of any pathway to real dissident discourse and thought. Comment sections on further reaches are being policed. Ones that they can‚Äôt policed, like this one, are probably going to be kill switched.If we respond to the provocations they win. If we don‚Äôt, we slowly bleed out. As long as there are pensions and salaries to fight for and guard the regime is holding all the cards.

        Everyone seems to have a wishlist for Tucker. Personally, I wish he would have explicitly savaged the left‚Äôs ‚ÄúOur Democracy‚Äù construct. He probably would have, with a little more time. He may still, for that matter.For one thing, the term only applies to the left. It‚Äôs Their Democracy, their Mobocracy, wrested from heritage America‚Äôs Republic.  The Estab had counted on the final push of getting those few million more feet across the border going off with increased momentum during a Hillary term. Obama had spent a lot of time courting the Hispanic bloc ‚Äì encouraging the bilingual policies, Dreamers etc, until Trump‚Äôs running called attention to the border and slowed their pipeline.Obama also expanded the coalition with the ‚ÄúPeople of Color‚Äù umbrella identity (simultaneously diluting blacks‚Äô importance while ginning up their resentment). Now the establishment is cultivating the mentally ill as a voting block and the newest permanent member of their coalition ‚Äì drawing young people to a life of mental illness far beyond the civilizational steady-state 3% gay rate. What new coalition will Mobocracy be creating this time next year?Second, half of the population has no business voting. Progressivism at work, over decades, has made good on delivering the vote to all but children.Third, democracy and fiat money go hand in hand since politicians garner votes by promising ‚Äústuff‚Äù that any real budget cannot afford. We live wildly beyond our means, and that goes doubly for the gubbermint-dependants spouting the ‚Äútax the rich‚Äù on behalf of AOC and the ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù harpie from MA.As for the Murdochs ‚Äì they suffer from the same illness as Trump did ‚Äì a ‚Äúfalse consciousness‚Äù ‚Äì and an unattainable desire for approval from the establishment. Pretty please, a pat on the head! They can‚Äôt accept that they form the basis against which the Estab defines itself.This particular crop of ‚Äúelite‚Äù seem the most lacking in the entire history of empire. It‚Äôs not that Biden is senile or that GWB was goofy or that the WH Stenographer Dinner attendees are childish ‚Äì those are the excuses they make for themselves to feel better about their miserable existences. The reality is they are evil. All the other claims are just windowdressing.

Are you surprised?
I hardly watch any television, but when it is on and I catch a glimpse of it in passing, or flick through the channels with the remote before shutting it off, there is literally nothing on it but Negroes. Every show, every commercial, every channel. I have come to refer to it as the (ahem, ahem) ‚ÄúNegrovision.‚Äù
If everything you knew about the United States came from television, you‚Äôd think it was located in central Africa.

                Sounds like we‚Äôre very much in the same boat. I avoid boob toob for all sorts of reasons, but in those instances I happen to stroll past a public TV screen, all I see are mandrills and orangutans. Just the other day I was in a Hilton hotel lobby, and there was a TV tuned to CNN‚Äìnatch‚Äìupon which was a pitch-black negress discoursing about Tornado Alley. Ye gods.

        I haven‚Äôt seen what Tucker has said about it, but Bongino said flat out that it wasn‚Äôt a firing, rather they couldn‚Äôt come to a contract renewal agreement.
Of course, it‚Äôs easy to be unreasonable enough that no agreement can be reached.
Methinks Fox is gonna find itself plumb Tuckered out.

        I have no idea why he was fired, so I‚Äôll use my fount of ignorance to post conspiracy: My gut feeling is that his termination is kabuki ‚Äì too pat somehow, too slick.There‚Äôs no real drama, no leaks that could really hurt Tucker ‚Äì as Zman says, the leaks just make him look like his normal, sensible, mild-mannered self. If they hated Tucker and wanted him off the playing field, why didn‚Äôt they make sure they had real kompromat on him before they pulled the trigger? And Tucker seems happier than the Cheshire cat falling into a tub of cream ‚Äì it all seems fake and performative, like they‚Äôre pulling their punches.Theory #1 It‚Äôs Tucker for President-time! The globalists decide they want rid of Trump, so they decide to field the only guy who could take the primary from him.Theory #2 Tucker is the new Shapiro: They want Tucker outside the MSM pissing in, someone who can act as backstop for all the racists and misogynists, someone who can capture and channel Deplorable energy in the right direction: supporting Israel, voting harder and praying for Jesus to save America, because Little Ben isn‚Äôt getting the job done.Evidence? Not a shred. If shit made sense we would be in the mess we‚Äôre in.

            A more likely theory: Murdoch is 92. His children are chi-chi liberals who got him all riled up to get rid of the employee who causes them embarrassment in their social circles. Murdoch flew off the handle and shitcanned Carlson. I give that one, also based on complete ignorance, far better odds, and in many ways it is the worst of all scenarios.

                        But their botched hatchet job could equally well support my theories.
Just because they let a senile old man occupy the White House, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôd accept the same for an important institution like Fox. Murdoch is part of the club and I doubt he‚Äôd fire Tucker without sounding out the idea first.

You anticipated where I was going. Biden is The Help and not a Cloud. It is easier to keep a whore sidelined than the pimp. And even being kept under wraps doesn‚Äôt prevent Biden from having‚Ä¶moments.
And to do my own jiu-jitsu, Murdoch was able to have a senior moment precisely because he is a Cloud.
I will recast the chicken bones again, of course.

                    If you always take the view that the Clouds are smart and have a master plan, eventually you end up ascribing Godlike powers to them. If they are human then they have to make mistakes some percentage of the time. Occasionally be rash. Sometimes be dumb. Miscalculate. Overreach. Get caught napping.

Not necessarily. You can have all the smarts in the world, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can plan for every eventuality because real life always throw you curveballs.
In analyzing politics, you should never ascribe to stupidity what can be explained by malice.

                What Jack Dobson and Zman said are almost certainly true, since we already know a bit about the kids‚Äô (and their wives) politics.
Sometimes something ‚Äúhappens‚Äù that scratches a lot of itches.
It‚Äôs kind of amazing Tucker went on as long as he did, especially considering he could not have first-tier advertisers (no offense to second and third tier). I almost get the feeling Tucker was deliberately moving ahead at an accelerated clip, knowing full well the call could come at any time.

                    These types have pathological imposter syndrome. It is one of the first things you notice about them, along with a degree of discomfort that feeds off itself. This is true if they have actually accomplished something, and even worse if they are heirs/trust fund baby adults who know they were born on third based and headed for home.I have absolutely no doubt the tranny psychosis is pushed by corporate execs, to give one example, because they lack the confidence to call bullshit. The Murdoch spawn likely felt they were in the wrong having Carlson on their payroll, which is in fact imposterism albeit not what I am referencing specifically. Even if Felix is 100 percent correct, and he may be for all we know, that was almost certainly an element to what happened here.

                I almost forgot. On his show this week when he was talking about that part of the story, Mark Steyn did something my mother used to do. The woman with the stupid allegations of antisemitism/etc. against Tucker has a very obviously Jewish name, I think Abby Grossberg. Mark equally obviously avoided saying her name and called her ‚Äú‚Ä¶oh something-or-other,‚Äù as if he couldn‚Äôt remember. My mother always did exactly that when the latest malefactor who‚Äôd made the news was a Jew. If she‚Äôd been around for #metoo she‚Äôd have called Harvey Weinstein ‚Äú‚Ä¶oh Harry Something.‚Äù

It‚Äôs also true that as the tyranny and depravity of clown world become more overt, the controlled opposition, if it is to be such, can‚Äôt just pretend that‚Äôs not happening. There has to be some degree of hangout, if there is to be controlled opposition at all. A fine line for it to walk

            At this point, any theory is as good as the next. I think Z is basically correct in that Dominion and social pressure were the dominant factors, although Tucker may have wanted out. My guess is that the ambiguity is deliberate, in that Fox is trying to engineer a ‚Äúconstructive termination‚Äù in order to keep the non-compete in force, possibly through the next election. The leaks are less to besmirch Tucker‚Äôs character than to convince the courts that he essentially fired himself.

            I dont understand the tendency to submit to the idea that every possible eventuality is preplanned and scripted down to the tiniest degree by an omniscient omniscient establishment.
Is this kind of totalizing defeatism just a psychological defense for if and when things get worse?  Like hedging for dissapointment with the possibility of an all purpose I Told You So?
Bad guys have a lot of power, sure, but quit mythologizing them and taking their self image for reality.

        ‚Äù What defines people at the top of the managerial class is their disdain for normal people.‚ÄùThough the decision to cancel Tucker seemed to be sudden, it was likely an accumulation of things, principally FOX going mainstream and Tucker becoming an embarrassment unlike Hannity and Laura who‚Äôs permitted to dump on the regime but only because her critique amounts to futile calls for the Repubs to have some more balls. Her stable of guests is harmless.Megyn Kelly‚Äôs take is that the Murdochs are willing to sacrifice ratings to bring the big brands back and that doing so will increase FOX‚Äôs bottom line at the all-important 8:00 p.m. EDST slot. Since Blackrock and Vanguard have large stakes in both FOX and Dominion, the settlement may be money changing pockets. And Maria Bartiromo still appears to have her job. And why axe Bongino? They also axed one of Ticker‚Äôs producers whom everyone seemed to like.The lawsuit seems to have been brought by a double agent who‚Äôs lost what little credibility she may have had. Apparently, she and Tucker never met.In the long run, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect too much from cable news. Personally, having spent quite a number of years in the Episcopal Church, I appreciated Tucker‚Äôs digs at that woke, opportunist, morally corrupt institution. And Trinity College isn‚Äôt far behind. (Why didn‚Äôt Tucker go to Yale where he‚Äôd‚Äôve been a legacy kid?) What‚Äôs admirable about Tucker is that despite the golden spoon with which he was born (check out his dad, Dick Carlson‚Äôs career,) Tucker seemed to have some genuine feeling for the toiling masses. So did Charles II, Stuart rascal though he may have been.

            There could be something to the advertising angle. Although advertising is a misleading word for what it really is. Regime media doesn‚Äôt care about ratings, nor do the ‚Äúadvertisers.‚Äù They are rewarded by regime affiliated corporations with ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù for spreading the regime message.
If you were wondering why Raytheon and Lockheed Martin ‚Äúadvertise‚Äù on Fox News. As if anybody viewing could or would ever buy any of their products.
For years I have puzzled at advertising by utility companies. Why? It‚Äôs not a competitive market. Who else were you going to get your electricity from?

                    The pharmacy companies for 40 years are used to go to doctors offices to advertise their stuff. It didn‚Äôt work out at all because the doctors and whatever they wanted regardless of the advertising.In the 1990s, pharmacy companies changed their tactic and now advertised to the patient directly  and then the patient would  contact the doctor. Most of the time if a patient request some medicine with the doctor ( unless it‚Äôs clearly dangerous and contra indicated ) they‚Äôll go ahead and give a prescription for the one the patient wants if there‚Äôs a choice between the advertised medicine and competitors drug .Advertising directly  to The patients was incredibly successful financially rather than going to the doctors.In great Britain for example pharmacy ads are not allowed on TV

        Excellent as usual, Z! But I think it is something bigger than just the firing of a popular pundit going on here. It just feels like there is a bigger story here? Let me throw out another theory:Tucker got fired ‚Äì and as you said, Don Lemon got turfed the same day. According to Mark Dice, CNN is now making pained efforts trying to pass themselves off as more balanced and objective. Fox is now too.Is the ruling class finally becoming aware of the great peril they are in? They have been playing with lighters, black powder, and gasoline for at least the last 20 years and more likely 30. There was big money in sensational copy and performance artists and content creators made a killing off of ginning up nasty rivalries and confrontations. As a result EVERYTHING is political now, right down to sportzball, the flu and the rope you use in the garage to pull the door down. The crazies have always been a problem for us and a profit for the establishment‚Ä¶ but now? The crazies are breeding like flies, and normie is getting restless.Normie isn‚Äôt laying on his couch anymore. He‚Äôs not drinking Bud Lite, He is starting to Notice the wrong things. Worse, he is talking about them. Antisemitism has gone through the roof. I think the jew noticing that would also be seriously wanting to know why. All the newspapers are laying off, downsizing or even closing down altogether. People are not watching sportzball or buying tickets. Several times a week, you see average normie white people getting viciously murdered by stupid looking clot headed blacks on Blab and other free thinking/free speech platforms.. The Narratives are falling apart. Even the lefitiest of the leftie shitlibs has to see that the wheels are coming off their bus, and Normie is loading his guns and stropping his bayonet. The real Boogaloonians are now pretty much radio silent and deep underground‚Ä¶ and the FBI is stuck going after morons like the proud boys, or the stubfart Oaf Keepers. Won‚Äôt be surprised to see them going after white supremist  organizations like the Shriners, the Elks and The Loyal Order Of Buffaloes next. Nobody is buying it and the result from the public is derisive laughter.Could this be the beginning of an honest attempt by the media to restore some kind of civility and objectivity? Hell‚Äôs bells ‚Äì TRUMP is going on CNN next week! In The Hive‚Ä¶ you fear The Bad Orange Man and you sure as hell don‚Äôt go after icons like Don Lemon. Or women or jews. Hell‚Ä¶ Leftie would have run Twitter right into the dirt had they not been able to pawn it off on Elon.I dunno‚Ä¶ I could be full a beans‚Ä¶ but this firing of Tucker feels to me like something much bigger, that there are tectonic masses involved‚Ä¶ and that they are finally beginning to move. Something HAS to be done, or something is going to give ‚Äì we could be at war with our families and brothers soon. I already am.Maybe that biases me in the way I perceive things. Whadda I know?

            Seems like wishful thinking to be honest. You‚Äôre hoping that somehow things will just go back to normal (1980 or 1990).
Have ideological ruling elites and/or crazies ever actually stopped and said ‚Äúhey, we‚Äôre going too far‚Äù?
If there is any ‚Äúpushback‚Äù it‚Äôs more likely because there are still a certain number of sane people in the upper echelon that never got purged. They may be slightly emboldened at the moment. There are not many, but there are still some.

                Yeah the rumors about Lemon have been around for a while. I think the Carlson timing was just a way of covering it up. I mean, can you imagine how many times Lemon has harassed women and said wildly inappropriate things? I am willing to wager that his, erm, boondoggle position had a million scandals that could have erupted at any time. I base this on nothing other than passing observation, but I bet CNN has paid dozens of settlements to women (or men) to keep Lemon‚Äôs behavior somewhat under wraps over the years.

                You may be right Mr. C‚Ä¶ but other small tidbits come to mind that may support my supposition. Only two things can happen going forward:a. The neoliberal order can leash their lunatics and impose order before they destroy us all.b. WE can impose order on them, and if we have to do it, the roof is coming down and the body counts will go through the roof.I see there is a Kennedy in liberal politics again‚Ä¶ and he presents himself as one to impose sanity on his fellow lunatics‚Ä¶ I personally don‚Äôt think either he or Trump is capable of such a thing‚Ä¶ but somebody will do it. Reality dictates it has to happen at some point‚Ä¶ .

            Sadly from my perspective, the shitlibs I interact with daily are fully within their media bubble. They literally do not know about any of the things you mention! They are completely ignorant of them or if they do have some knowledge more often their opinion is merely the Current Thing Narrative and they are too stupid to realize or care.
This is why I am convinced that this will all inevitably lead to ultra violence. These two competing ‚Äúrealities‚Äù cannot exist within the same nation if it wants to remain peaceful.

                To support Neon‚Äôs point, I have an old school, ‚ÄúDemocrats are the party of the working man‚Äù liberal friend who gets all his news from NPR and Colbert.
He was astounded to learn that Kyle Rittenhouse didn‚Äôt kill blacks, and he talked to me about his sense of being misled.  The tone of all the media that he had consumed led him to be certain that Rittenhouse killed blacks, like a klansman.
To his credit, he has become somewhat skeptical of the media‚Äôs reporting on crime now.  None of this has changed his absolute credulity on climate change, unfortunately.

            Glenfilthie: ‚ÄúThe crazies are breeding like flies‚Ä¶‚ÄùMaybe if you were to consider indoctrination &amp; mesmerization &amp; hypnotization &amp; brainwashing of the weak-minded to be ‚Äúbreeding‚Äù.I.e. if you‚Äôre talking about an abstract psychological breeding.But in terms of PIV intercourse and natural childbirth [no epidural, no caesarean], I don‚Äôt know that the Left is still in the ball game.Setting aside Hart/Cellar and mass immigration, there simply aren‚Äôt gonna be very many young White sh!tlibs in our near future.And that‚Äôs before you factor in the effect of the v@xxinations [which is to head straight to the patients‚Äô gonads, in order to sterilize them, perhaps even before the pericarditis/myocarditis sets in].BTW, speaking of psychological breeding, this is why the s0d0mites &amp; the s@pphistes &amp; the tr@nnies are compelled to molest: The psychological torment of molestation is their recruiting &amp; initiation &amp; mesmerization/hypnotization ritual.Anyway, the tl;dr is that massive demographic changes will be taking place in the next decade or thereabouts, to the point that many Normies circa 2033 are not going to understand WTH just happened.And I‚Äôm including White sh!tlib normies in that diagnosis: The few surviving White sh!tlibs won‚Äôt recognize anything at all.BTW, Tucker Carlson has done rather well for himself on the PIV/natural-childbirth angle, as has his bestie, Elon Musk‚Ä¶

        While we are busy looking at the past and trying to make sense out of how we got where we are, the regime lives in the future, because the regime knows the future. It has plans. And I‚Äôve no doubt that Tucker‚Äôs deplatforming was part of their preparation to clear the decks of any resistance for 2024. Their election rigging apparatus is still in its relative infancy. You are seeing the fine tuning in real time.

            The present is unpredictable, the future is certain, to quote someone. He who controls the present controls the past, he who controls the past controls the future, to quote someone else. The tension between those two lines of thought probably better explains the ham-handed approach to all things in the endless present than mere insecurity, which is how it appears on the surface.

        Assuming Z‚Äôs theory of Pariah Fatigue is correct‚Äìand I suspect it may well be‚ÄìFox‚Äôs capitulation resembles Daniel Snyder, who, after many years of standing up to the crazies on the Redskins moniker, finally bent the knee and gave the NFL its sanitary Commanders. (Hey, at least it‚Äôs not some abstract collective noun like the Wild or the Magic.) So far, we have virtually no examples of elites who have been able to permanently ignore the perpetual shaming from the Power Structure. Verily, we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven. We are simpering, mincing and fearful. We treat opprobrium as if it were the literal equivalent of being burnt at the stake. Until we gain some real toughness and perspective, the Great Derangement will continue unabated.

            ‚ÄúWe treat opprobrium as if it were the literal equivalent of being burnt at the stake.‚ÄùGREAT line.Social media, to cite one example, may not be the cause of this phenomenon, but it certainly has acted as an accelerant. Westerners have become quite Japanese-like in recent years and embrace and fear ‚Äúthe nail sticking out gets hammered in‚Äù impulse. While the individualism of White Westerners is decried because it indeed made us vulnerable, it also led to the creation of great art and resulted in remarkable scientific advances. Hammered in people, fearful of opprobrium, are incapable of such heights, and perhaps the current iteration is incapable of any level of civilization.

            I‚Äôll have to look this Snyder fellow up, Ostei. I suspect, like most who temporarily resist, he appealed to reason.God can help us here, if we let Him. We simply denounce our enemies as Evil heretics and continue to bear the cross, come what may. Easier said than done, of course; I have not been in Snyder‚Äôs shoes. But realization of Evil forwhat it isis the missing ingredient, I think. And, from lessons of the Holy Fathers, who held fast during the most incredible oppression, we see that this indeed is the way.But it‚Äôs a painful way, alright.I suspect most here, Christian or not, have encountered the Evil too many a time and have said ‚ÄúNo more.‚Äù. Could be at work, at a family gathering, or the like. But these are important stepping stones, and after you‚Äôve taken one? Well, perhaps the Grace of God descends and you can take more.

        Yeah I‚Äôll go along with that recap.Tucker is not a warrior, he‚Äôs a pink-pilled educator.  So, like Donald Trump, Tucker didn‚Äôt count coup or take any scalps.  Tucker made waves but no permanent changes.  The Politburo isn‚Äôt worried about him.  They‚Äôre just methodically extinguishing the resisters and truthspeakers.Tucker‚Äôs a Standard Normie, Eighties-era lib with an extra jolt of intelligence and common-sense patriotism.  Solid family man but don‚Äôt expect him to skeer anybody on the battlefield.  I used to call him ‚ÄòCucker Tarlson‚Äô because like his fellow ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô he cannot handle the female question, which is at the heart of America‚Äôs demise.  After all, what would his three daughters think as they made their way through Woke College and Empowered Don‚Äôt Need No Man Careers?I wish Tucker well, he did pretty good and most important he confesses Christ.  But he is a sheep, not a sheepdog.

                Says he‚Äôs Christian.  Haven‚Äôt met him personally so I dunno.  For his sake I hope he is.
A good example of what ‚Äòconfessing Christ‚Äô is occurs when the King addresses His latter-day church of brotherhood, in Rev. 3:8.  He praises that church because it did not ‚Äòdeny my name‚Äô.  So, pretty straightforward.
If Carlson is a supporter of homos pretending to be married, then that‚Äôs a problem of worldly pollution and certainly calls his sincerity and commitment into serious question.  He ain‚Äôt in my church put it that way.

        The Tucker saga also exposes how anything short of ‚Äútotal victory‚Äù is framed as a loss by our chattering class.  Fox is CNN most of the day.  They even had a big LGBTQIA+ celebration last year. Most of them were down with the riots in 2020.  Tucker was a lone voice even at Fox.  But having even a single guy not toeing the line is too much for them to take.  He must be destroyed.

        For lack of Tucker, I‚Äôve gone back to listening to the Sith.  The Fall of Tucker has them reinvigorated and ready for the fray; one of the Hive olfactants was farting out the change in direction*, saying ‚ÄúTrump fatigue‚Äù.Simply put, with Le Tuck as their newest freshest Hate fetish, the Sith are losing their sh*t!(Ants lay out a trail by smell; the other ants can‚Äôt but help themselves to follow to the next breadcrumb.

        It‚Äôs a pity, but it‚Äôs not terribly surprising from a business point of view.In the final analysis, TV is about advertising revenue. Ratings are not necessarily the same as revenue. Yes, Tucker had great ratings. But the major advertisers, with the encouragement of the Regime, were growing leery of Fox, just like they are doing with Twitter.Meanwhile, Fox needs the support of the Regime to make acquisitions and secure programming rights (FIFA, NFL, NBA etc). Fox is also competing for content with Netflix, Amazon, etc. In this scenario, it is very hard for them to continue to resist the Woke hordes.Tucker is probably happy he can reboot on a Podcast for big $$ and avoid the Howard Beale treatment.

            That Carlson has been able to ‚Äúavoid the Howard Beale treatment‚Äù (great reference, by the way) tells us he‚Äôs no serious threat to the regime. I suspect that the powers that be merely grew tired of what in their minds was his annoying antics.Regardless of his level of sincerity, Carlson always functioned as a COPE for his fan club ‚Äî as if one fella ‚Äúspeaking truth to power‚Äù could somehow compensate for the irreversible corruption and degeneracy that have come to define our entire culture/politics. That COPE has now been removed. Could be a good thing. At the very least, it‚Äôs not nearly the bad thing that many presume it to be.

            In his Sub-star, the Zman reminds us of the cable tax that supercedes ad revenue.
I‚Äôm thinking the ability to float commercial paper (corporate bonds) has become as or more important than quarterly earnings estimates.
This means cash flow is a higher concern than fundamentals, because of ESG loan guidelines.
The corporations are captive to the banks. That, and a lot of golden parachutes are being prepared.

Assuming they could make a decent app, hosting a bunch of non-woke traditional entertainment could make Fox number one in competition with Netflix and Amazon.  Netflix is full of absolute garbage.  Not just ‚Äúwoke‚Äù garbage, but films that make the typical B movie look like cinematic masterpieces.  Between the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù garbage and the just plain garbage on the streaming sites, it should be relatively easy to blow them out of the water.

That‚Äôs why I listen to ‚ÄúIndie‚Äù music.  Without fanfair or studio contracts, for decades the white kids have been putting out clean, interesting, often lovely music with nothing but beautiful White voices.
It‚Äôs the White version of the fake Judeo-Negroid rap industry, and it has no Suge Knights or Dr. Dre‚Äôs.

        ‚ÄúSince Trump came down the escalator, the Murdoch family has been subjected to the worst sort of social pressure. Despite their great wealth, they still seek approval from their social class.‚ÄùIsn‚Äôt it strange how conformist the supposedly most-exceptional people can be? It‚Äôs tempting to think it‚Äôs the nature of power, but there‚Äôs power in being different, too.‚ÄúWhat defines people at the top of the managerial class is their disdain for normal people. As a result, there is a tremendous amount of pressure on members of the elite to conform to current fads.‚ÄùThere, I suspect, is the answer. It has more to do with the nature of aristocracy, so to speak. The best‚Äîor at least the people who aspire to be the best‚Äîprove to be utterly mediocre. The most normie, in a sense. Maybe hence the disdain. Tucker‚Äôs expulsion is proof he‚Äôs the best of that particular bunch.Normie is frustrating, but normie doesn‚Äôt pretend he‚Äôs something he‚Äôs not. His life doesn‚Äôt revolve around chasing markers of status and convincing others to take part in his delusion. (Unless that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs told to do lol. Normie is the good soldier, at best.) These people are the worst, because they‚Äôre driven to be something they can never be, and they‚Äôve managed to infect society with their pathology.Writ large. Think trans.

Hmmm, IMO this notion does not pass the sniff test. Joe and Jane Normie signal exactly those things, with their name-brand college bumper stickers. Doing so, they not only plunge their offspring into heavy debt (not to mention mind control), but convince others it‚Äôs all worth it.

Seriously, I take your point, but the idea that people are lumps of clay or sheep doesn‚Äôt come from nowhere. Normie apes the strength-in-numbers crowd because we aren‚Äôt led by those with actual, God-given talent, capable of ruling more than a steaming pile of shit.

                The pressure is always to conform to your social caste.  If you‚Äôre a managerial elite then it‚Äôs the bien pensant social activism and a Tesla.  Middle class is similar bien pensant social activism and a Prius, as they perpetually try to ape the upper class.Working class conforms to its own caste standards, if you‚Äôve ever been near a construction project note the identical gigantic pickup trucks polished and perfectly clean.  Oh and the identical arm tattoos.  The mudsharking women also have such similar fashion sense that I can usually identify them even without the jogger with his hand down her pants in public, or the little pickaninny trailing behind her.

            The empire has aspired to expand the ‚Äúelite‚Äù to numbers that are simply impossible.  We have something like 40% of people thinking they are at least part of the elite or, at a minimum, can be elite at some point in the future.,
‚ÄúNormie‚Äù is in reality over 90% (probably over 95%) of the population. Granted, it‚Äôs not one big undifferentiated mass, but rather the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range. We have a ton of mediocre climbers watering down the whole concept.  None of them are the top 1/10th of 1% or even 1%, frankly.

                Yep.  Just a recent survey, Pew Research I believe, the wealth it now takes to be included in the top 1% is about $2.5M (or more obviously). For the top 2%, $1.5M.  Now, assuming wealth follows elite status to a high degree, that would seem to reduce the numbers of folk *allowed* entrance.
But we can dream, can‚Äôt we?   üòâ

                    I‚Äôm not familiar with the Pew survey, but the U.S. government percentile stats are always given across all age groups.  If Pew is the same, the 99% not having $2.5 million includes college kids and people just starting out.   A more informative number would be 99% percentile wealth at age 60, when folks are nearly done earning.  My guess is that number, for the top 1% is more like $10 million.

            Apparently, Carlson‚Äôs unfathomable transgression was saying that multiple guys beating up one guy is not the way white men fight. Such behavior is dishonorable. Such a statement, you see, is white supremacy. **shrug** I really couldn‚Äôt care less. The more I hear of what the Power Structure designates as white supremacy, the more I feel like waving my white supremacist banner on high.

I don‚Äôt apologize for it, and never will.WS only recently became popular as a cope for the cultural inferiority of any number of minorities who dwell in close contact with Whites.  Not putting down all races and cultures, not elevating what we typically term White trash either, only simply talking about means and averages.  There are clines.Had this discussion with my daughter just yesterday.  We were discussing a *new* dog we have.  An elderly women passed away a week ago or so and wife was the only person at her side in ICU.  Her son could not be bothered to stay by her side.   He‚Äôs White trash, and looks the part.  Almost with this woman‚Äôs last breath was a concern about her three dogs locked up in her home‚Äîuncared for.  My wife said she‚Äôd handled this and not to worry.  Then she passed and wife came home to tell me of the situation‚Äîshe‚Äôd never held a person hand while they died.  I was stunned at the story, but accepted that we now had a binding obligation.After some time attempting to contact neighbors in this woman‚Äôs (primarily Hispanic) neighborhood, wife found a neighbor who knew the women and had the key‚Äôs to her home.  This neighbor explained that some other neighbors had become concerned over the dogs and had ‚Äútaken care of them‚Äù.Wife not being reassured obtained the keys and we entered the home.  Two of the dogs who we learned were young and smallish were gone.  Left in a dog crate in the dark was an old, and I mean old, Poodle.  Seems no one wanted an old sick dog, so they grabbed the young ones and were gone leaving the Poodle to fend for himself.  How? Wife, of course, grabbed the old, fat, sickly Poodle and kept her (our) promise.  (The damn dog never leaves my side‚Äîhe knows a good thing when he sees it.)My daughter could not understand how anyone could enter a home and ‚Äúrescue‚Äù only two of three dogs.  She is hopelessly naive as to cultures.  This is one of the few times I bluntly told her she doesn‚Äôt understand because she assumes everyone is ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù.

                    An excellent observation and story, Compsci. Alas, one of the things you describe (unconditional compassion) that makes our people superior, has also made us self-destructive. It is one thing to rescue a poor, old, harmless and helpless poodle. It is quite another to rescue a hapless race of people who are quite the opposite of harmless. Whites do not understand the reasonable terminus of a good thing.

        The only time I saw Carlson was via clips on various websites ‚Äì and he was about as good as it got as far as calling out or lampooning the deep state and their narratives.  But I have to say his high pitched girlie man laugh was like nails on a chalkboard.

        ‚ÄúIn the case of Tucker, the crazies think he wears a white sheet in his free time, while his fans worry that maybe he does not wear a white sheet in his free time.‚Äù Damn. I don‚Äôt think we credit Zman enough for his sense of humor. That‚Äôs a hilarious line.Here‚Äôs what I told a cousin of mine who said he was ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù that Tucker Carlson had been fired: one guy on a cable news program talking trash about our rulers will not save our civilization. Like virtually everything else hyped by mainstream media, this firing is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Carlson getting the ax might actually be a good thing for a lot of his fan base. It could serve as a wake-up call for them. Perhaps some of those remaining blinders might come off. Time to lose every last iota of faith one might retain in the U.S. regime.P.S.: It‚Äôs easy for me to say all that because I was not a follower of Carlson. I‚Äôve seen plenty of clips of his commentary and he was fine as it goes . . . but if this is as ‚Äúedgy‚Äù as a person can get away with being on primetime TV, our culture is probably a lost cause.

        ‚Äúthe Murdoch family has been subjected to the worst sort of social pressure. Despite their great wealth, they still seek approval from their social class. The reason they fired Tucker and will most likely turn Fox News into a gay version of CNN is they simply grew tired of being pariahs.‚ÄùIn other words, FOX is controlled opposition, they are are only allowed to give the approved ‚Äúconservative‚Äù viewpoint so long as it does not actually threaten the power of the ruling class.FOX is a pacifier to keep Norm Griller thinking that voting still matters, he lives in the freest country in the world, blacks are just the same as whites except for skin color, Ukrainians are fighting for freedom and democracy, and Israel is our greatest ally.Nota bene, Israel bootlicker and Ukraine shill Hannity still has a secure gig on FOX.

            I stopped watching Hannity several years ago when he just kept repeating himself over and over.  Hillary used bleach bit on her servers, and now here is Lindsay Graham to lie about how he will get to the bottom of it.
Now it occurs to me that this is why he is no threat to the regime.  Sure, he pounds the table about whatever is already known about what the left is doing.  But he never breaks any news or has any original insights.  Tucker was exposing details no one else in mainstream conservatism would touch.

                I agree about Hannity. Every now and then I will accidently flip to the Patriot channel on XM and if I wasn‚Äôt looking at the clock on my car radio, I would think it was still 2010, Obama was still president and Hillary was pulling everyone‚Äôs strings. To be fair, the look of our political and economic systems is so similar that I can understand getting confused.

                Aside from what‚Äôs already mentioned wrt Hannity‚Äîlike he‚Äôs the stupidest personality on the air‚Äîis that he makes the show about himself.  He can‚Äôt stand to let a caller or ‚Äúguest‚Äù expound for more than 15 seconds without inanely interrupting and taking over the point being made‚Äîalways without adding anything of substance.
Yet, Hannity‚Äôs show is high in ratings?  Why?  Well, I assume he‚Äôs found a niche among Joe Normie types.  If so, then we are doomed that there are so many as to create such an audience for such a low intellect narcissist host.

Not a shadow of a doubt about it. But shouldn‚Äôt we have already known that long before Carlson got the boot? I knew it many, many moons ago. I‚Äôm guessing you likely knew it as well.The more invested an entity is in the system, the more suspect that entity is. FOX is a massive corporation with a major seat at the system‚Äôs banquet table (guess who‚Äôs on the menu?). Nobody with any grasp of how the world works would trust such an outfit. They‚Äôre telling you all the news that the fat cats want you to believe ‚Äî no different than any of the leftist organs.

        The marching morons of ConInc. are 1,000% committed to the notion that they will eventually muster the right magic words and miraculously persuade the masses to return to sanity. In this fevered delusion, ‚Äúsane‚Äù politicians are thereby elected to office and the country does a 180 deg turn for the better. But this is just a slick version of ‚Äúchase the carrot‚Äù so that you don‚Äôt have to get the fat ass up off the couch.With the firing of Carlson, who is going to pick up the baton of Master Persuader and keep normie ranting in front of the TV as the approved pressure relief valve? This is critical because, as long as normie has beer and Cheetos, he will grunt and fart his way to relief rather than take to the streets in protest. Murdock needs to think seriously about replacing Carlson with Dylan Mulvaney and doing a Bud Light on Fox News.And all of this is a sideshow. Two megatrends have sealed our fate. The first is the industrial scale vote manufacturing that determines the outcome of all elections going forward. The old canard about voter fraud being about 0.5% is laughable now. It easily reaches into the 20-30% range in most urban areas around the country. Second is that voter fraud is actually unnecessary. Tens of millions of Americans voted to put a dementia patient in the White House and millions of Pennsylvanians voted to put a certifiable nut case in the Senate. And this is the tip of the iceberg. Most DC politicians are either pathologically corrupt or full retard (or both).The only real remedy is collapse and rebirth under the natural duress of existential hardship.

One argument puts us on the defensive and cedes the status quo to the perverts, the other puts them on the defensive and really gets to the point of their efforts.

                The reason is because we have elected bad politicians to infest DC and voter fraud keeps incumbency at over 97%. Chicken and the egg.

        It was suggested in the thread yesterday that the target audience for propaganda is not normies, but true believers.   Normies will never do anything.  To riff on that idea, perhaps the reason Tucker survived as long as he did, and why he has now gone, is that Fox News was supposed to be dirt people propaganda.   If Tucker started to get mind-share among a fraction of the upper middle class, that would be about as welcome to the elite as a toilet backing up.

So, not only is normie a target, everybody else is, too.For example, imagine the joy of The Evil One when he manages to convince the son of a strong, Christian Dissident man that he‚Äôs really a women.The Evil is real.

                Whatever the true motives of the alleged shooter (or any other shooters) were, I would not underestimate the ability of the casino owners to squelch everything about this story. They have both the motive and the clout to make that happen. The last thing they want is people thinking of mass shooting when they think of Vegas. Bad for business. Not to mention their legal liability for allowing the guy up in there in that room with all those weapons (if that‚Äôs what really happened). They are the people most directly and negatively affected by any sunlight on the truth about what happened. Thus it is in their interest to make the whole thing just go away, and they probably have the ability to make that happen.

Not very long after MBS got his revenge, killed some family members and stole the wealth of the others.  Also that journalist that was chopped up into pieces had something to do with it.

                Like the current Tucker event, people are looking for excitement where there‚Äôs only a lie.
When you lack information about a crime‚Äôs perpetrator, turn to ‚Äúvictimology‚Äù‚Äîin the old sense. Who are the victims of the crime? Did the perpetrator know who he was killing? If so, mystery of motive solved.
The Deadliest Mass Shooting In American History‚Ñ¢ was a shitlib slaughtering rednecks because the TV told him to.

        I‚Äôve yet to see a ‚Äúdamning, leaked‚Äù clip of Tucker that didn‚Äôt make me like him more.
The clip with him saying his appearance would be judged by ‚Äúpost menopausal women‚Äù wasn‚Äôt just funny, but a pretty keen observation of reality of his networks main demographic. Along with his critics demo as well.
‚ÄúMisogynistic?‚Äù  For that?  You‚Äôve got to be kidding me.

        I was genuinely surprised by the media matters ‚Äúleaks‚Äù and any dirt dished out in general.  Tucker appears genuine.  He is who he says he is.  Maybe his speech about truth or whatever isn‚Äôt a double-secret CIA plot.  Maybe he‚Äôs just a rare bird.

            Yeah, kudos (?!) to Fox News for keeping him on as long as they did. They could have had a lineup of Hannity and Shapiro and Gutfeld and whatever CoC goon they scraped off the floor of the AEI executive bathroom, but they kept Tucker who has been radioactive to the regime since 2017. Read his bookShip of Fools(published back in 2018) and you wonder why Fox didn‚Äôt can him way back then. I‚Äôm guessing he had a lot of support, especially in the management of FNC, which is a white pill. Only the holy of holies (the Murdoch inner circle) wanted him out.

        That white people have specific rules of combat and fair play is a fact so obvious that it‚Äôs farcical to argue against it. This is why the usual suspects are either just pointing and shrieking or posting graphs of lynches throughout history (let‚Äôs forget for a moment most of those guys lynched were guilty as hell). I have never seem a black confrontation that did not incorporate the swarm strategy, nor one that stopped once the person was down and no longer a threat.More generally, most of the leaks have backfired and made him even more likeable, and this is the first one that would make the normiecon a little squeamish to defend, even if he knows Tucker is right.There‚Äôs a reason the truth about race needs to be the focus of right-wing rhetoric, because as soon as whites are able to process and understand such a clear truth, all the regime propaganda comes crashing down. Paradoxically, this message may be the best way to get this conversation going if used right.

When white men go to war, especially Americans, they couldn‚Äôt fight any dirtier.
Blowing up civilian infrastructure projects (electric plants, dams, pipelines, pharmaceutical plants, etc) leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths of women and children  over the ensuing decades is just standard operating procedure.

Probably not a coincidence that during his last couple of weeks on Fox, Tucker interviewed Trump, RFK Jr., and Elon Musk.  All characters that the cloud people desperately want silenced.

                Maxda:  We moved just under a month ago.  I haven‚Äôt watched tv in years, but my husband still paid for and watched cable (although less and less as time went by).  Since we moved he has not watched one moment of tv ‚Äì not in the hotel, not in our new home (which I think has roku).  I am so grateful for so many things right now ‚Äì among them, that our rural move seems to have finally severed my husband‚Äôs tv habit.  Our younger son got roku at his new house in town (about an hour from us) and was still following the NFL draft ‚Äì but for once, my husband did not share that interest.  Instead, he and I now watch the deer outside our window as we eat dinner.

                In the short term there are still normie boomers watching Fox News, Tucker introduced them to arguments they weren‚Äôt going to hear anywhere else.  The ratings have fallen off faster than I expected.  Maybe even they are getting tired of the crap being peddled at them every night.

            Long term, the most significant aspect of the Regime‚Äôs latest shitshow may be the death of cable television. Good riddance. Short term, we are once again reminded that this is a system riddled with insecurity and more afraid than we are confident that it isn‚Äôt long for the world. While censorship and oppression have sadistic elements, they ultimately represent fear. Wounded beasts are the most dangerous, though, and people would do well to bear that in mind.The Regime has gotten rid of someone who says nasty and hurtful things about it and brought home the point to millions perhaps for the first time it no longer has much if any legitimacy. It is a system in crisis.
