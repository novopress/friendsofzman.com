        The past 10 years seem to be a waste of time for everyone, nothing really changed except a steady loss of wealth and health. If I could give a lesson to my past self 10 years ago, it would be to completely ignore politics and culture, save myself from caring about any of it. Of course I’m happy to be on this side of the divide and to have found the Z blog and the fantastic comment section which makes me feel not so alone. However, now it all feels like meh, who cares. We all know that apart from a calm pause from the carnies the grifters, commies and cocksuckers are still out there waiting for their chance to drive a knife in the back of America and the rest of white culture… I just feel completely empty out this whole circus we’ve been through.

            Yeah, I’m completely exhausted by all of it. I’ve felt like I’ve been under constant attack since the Obama years.
As much as you might like to ignore politics, though, politics will not ignore you. Control of the institutions matters. If you are a white man and you are a designed Enemy of the People, you cannot hide. The only recourse is to have a guy who is on your side in power.

                I think the reason many of us are disappointed is because Trump did such a great job exposing the phonies who were supposedly on our side. They were never on our side. If they were, Obamacare would be gone by now.

                You are right that politics will not ignore you. Many in the Dissident Right want to flee all positions of power. Become welders or some other type of tradesman and live in the country. However, the other side is not letting you run away. They are determined to destroy the opposition. If you don’t have power you will ultimately be crushed.
The Right needs to find a way to subvert the institutions for their benefit just like the Jews did

                        This is why non-religious Jews still have a strong Jewish identity.Conversely, this is something most Whites do not have.  Outside of outliers like us (in many cases even ours is a bit contrived), there really isn’t a White identity.  Until I went to public school, I also had no sense of White identity (and it really has to happen young).  But you can ask any 6 year old Jewish or Black or Middle Eastern kid who they are and their ethnicity will be right at the top, maybe after boy or girl.Their ethnic identity is something most non-Whites have in America.  This is how they stick together so well and we do not.  There is no “we” that is exclusive to us.  American is about as close to an identity White people have besides their old ethnic identities and even that tends to be very weak.  Most White people will lump Chinese or Jewish or Indian with Americans, so American is very diluted.Anyone with young children should make sure their children have a White identity.

            It can certainly feel like a waste of time, but I am certain that it wasn’t.  At least not all of it.  Not for me as an individal, and certainly not for the nation.But if I could have spent half as long doing half as much, and the rest on something else, it would have been better for everyone involved.You are right about the health angle.  The last decade has been extremely unhealthy for everyone, and this is a marathon we are running.If I could dictate the next four years it would be this: reduce the number of silos, begin to organize and infiltrate in the physical world, jettison yesterday’s men and inveterate assholes, and otherwise keep up the pressure on all fronts.

                “begin to organize and infiltrate in the physical world”
Please don’t take this the wrong way. How? Let’s not worry about the larger things like academia. Start small, and build successful models. How do you take over the HR department where you are working?

                    I am talking about forming our own things — small, successful models as you say — as well as getting involved with things like Our Country Our Choice.  It’s not explicitly pro-White but their front man clearly knows who the problem is, unlike a lot of supposed pro-White eminences who are still wheezing along on the fumes of a largely unearned reputation.I am also talking about people under the age of 60 taking over the existing pro-White organizations, purging the boomers, and putting them on a path to be taken over by people under the age of 50 in 5-10 years.  We need leaders, not more podcasts.It’s sort of like the way there was the IRA and Sinn Fein.  I am not talking about a paramilitary organization, but having people both in America First civnat organizations and in explicitly pro-White organizations.The aim is to produce a racially conscious ethnic lobby that has to be dealt with during elections and can also become the basis of a breakaway movement when/if the republic collapses.

            I’m feeling something very similar right now. It is very anticlimactic. I was hoping at least for a couple of hangings and I’m not saying that flippantly. I seriously do want to see somebody, preferably dozens of people, hang.

                    I’m not sure I totally agree.
I mean, look at how the Biden regime ran around and hung goofy names on our military bases.
Additionally, this symbolic stuff gives the Marxists something to waste an inordinate amount of time and energy coping and seething over. Turnabout is fair play!

            I’m watching the people at Trump’s inaugural. Half The Washington Post seems to be there, along with Silicon Valley.
Trump should’ve had a swearing-in somewhere out in Middle America. The symbolism of his voters being unable to watch this in person — while the people Trump calls “the swamp” stand in the room — is very palpable, at least to me.

                Agreed.  An inauguration surrounded by us ‘little people’ would have been far more appropriate — and telling — than a bunch of the usual D.C. scum.
Leaving those people out and allowing us to attend would have sent a very strong message.

            Well, there was the normalization of memes in political discourse, too. I hate it. Not memes, they have their nitwit uses, just tired from how debased and abstracted its all become. Though…I did get to talk with a couple of younger side zoomers and yeah, they’re definitely from a different era and certainly upbringing, but it damn it was fun they actually spoke like normal people. Could be I ran into (or rode into in this case, was out bicycling) some exceptions. Don’t know, don’t care, it was refreshing.

            Great post – your comments articulate to perfection how I feel.  I’m so exhausted from all of it that my focus has greatly shifted elsewhere.  I’m tired of letting it dominate my mood, my attitude and my interactions with my wife and other family and friends.  The power of hatred is strong and can be a good thing at times, but for extended periods it becomes too exhausting to continue.  I fully support normal White people, cut out any black acquaintances I once had, avoid black areas like the plague, etc.  That is how I will live my life.

        This should be the time of a great reckoning. Biden’s final pardons are in ,which as predicted included Fauci, Milley and the January 6th committee. No matter what, Trump’s administration should find a way to destroy these people and let America know that the criminal and treasonous  Biden gang will be dealt with until justice is finally served.

                That’s an interesting proposal.  Get the dope on these folk.  Force them to lie—rather than tell the truth.  Get them on perjury charges, which the Presidential Pardon does not cover—in theory.
Another is to press the issue of preemptive pardons.  This really needs to go away in a just society (…yeah, I know…).  A pardon or commutation “adjusts” criminal sanctions having been issued upon knowledge/conviction of the crime.  Pre-emptive pardons make a mockery of justice and all right-thinking citizens should be appalled.

            We’ll just have duelling outrages. The outgoing administration pardons its, er, “controversal” figures, while the incoming one pardons its controversial figures which were the victims of the “insurrection”. So the online rabble on both sides get all mad. I don’t care about this kabuki nonsense. Fauci can live out the rest of his days sipping margaritas; I don’t care. I only care that Trump’s new presidency emboldens some alpha chads who right the ship that has veered way off course.

                    Agreed.It’s easy to shrug and try not to think of Fauci and Milley and Cheney shuffling off to posh but irrelevant positions the Cloud People retire their pets to. It’s easy not to notice them as they publish the odd piece of propaganda in the the mainstream rag sheets, or warm chairs as ‘consultants’ and ‘co-ordinators’ in poch offices of the NGOs and fake charities run by the Machine. Just grit your teeth… and forget about itBut if you lost YOUR business during the covid hoax, or watch a loved one die alone in a hospital where fatty nurses danced in the hall ways? Or if YOUR kid got taken by one of their perverts in the pedophile and human trafficking rackets? Or someone you love got killed by some migrant that has been deported 3 times already?We will know we have turned a corner when some of these people are held to account.

                        The release of all available information the government has on everyone given a Biden pardon should be immediately released. The pardon only ptotects them from federal prosecution, it does not protect them from public disclosure and shaming with the well deserved reputation destruction.
The regime has conveniently given us a list of people to investigate and destroy. And we shall.

                “Fauci can live out the rest of his days sipping margaritas…”The Fauci pardon (and the perhaps others) destroys the rule of law.  What it means is that the law does not apply to people with the *right* connections, i.e., the power in charge.  Hence henchmen that aid these people in illegal actions become emboldened and more such people become common.This is precisely the opposite of what Jefferson meant when he declare all men to be equal (under law).  We are dangerously drifting to a rule by men (already there?)—not law.  This is in regard to “pre-emptive” pardons, not after conviction or at least the formal accusation and presentation of evidence.Yes, Fauci will sip margaritas on the beach, but he will also deny an criminal culpability, retain his ill gotten fortune as a highly paid official, and the public will never know the what and how or extent of this man’s “criminal” career.

                I care, these are people that committed monstrous crimes effecting just about everyone on the planet. There is no reason to respect any piece of paper a drooling vegetable may have signed. It has no legitimacy and  certainly no moral claim. It doesn’t even have a practical justification since that genie (rule of law, etc.) has long since been out of the bottle. By their own example any legal constraints may be justifiably skirted, subverted or simply ignored in the pursuit of the more important moral imperative.

                    You think this way. I think this way. But many, many people don’t think this way. They think Fauci is great. Same for Milley. FFS, same for Biden and Kamala. This revenge fantasy is not going to happen. Our enemy is not vanquished, by a long shot. They are still everywhere. Raging against Fauci, Biden et. al. is not going to do anything except affect your blood pressure.
The best revenge will be Trump being effective and popular for the next 4 years, and laying the foundation for decades of energetic nationalist politicians who will finish what Trump started.

                There’s going to be a public humiliation of Fauci and it is going to drive him to the grave.  In fact, I think he’s probably going to wind up wishing he was dead once there’s a full accounting of the COVID origins.  Those pardons won’t protect the people who worked for him, who helped finance the GoF research in China, and who participated in the online censorship of TRUE information at Fauci’s behest.That man needs to go to his grave – whether as a free man or not – with the full knowledge that his crimes have been laid bare for all to see.

I would ignore Tater Joe’s pardons and lock up the enemies of America you have listed.  Plus a passel more.  Then adopt their own tactic: whatcha gonna do about it?

                I agree, a pardon should only be issued after a conviction in court. The problem is that the Ford-Nixon pardon established the precedent for blanket immunity fifty years ago.

                “…the Trump administration should ignore them and proceed with investigations and prosecutions as usual.”
Another good idea, this would force an appeal to SCOTUS which has been on my mind as to how to right this wrong of preemptive “pardons”. If SCOTUS agrees, then we go the traditional Constitutional change route to the States.

                Article II, Sec. II:
“…he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”
I would think this includes civil penalties for non-criminal violations levied under federal law.

            We have to look at those pardons as a gift.  The recipients have been issued a poison pill.  They are no longer safe from a subpoena…because they cannot take the 5th Amendment against self-incrimination.  Alternatively, they could reject the pardon, but then subject themselves to criminal prosecution.This is a huge gift to Pam Bondi and Kash Patel because they can credibly claim that it’s not about revenge because the guilty have already been pardoned.  It’s about finding out what was done AND MAKING IT ALL PUBLIC so that everyone knows once and for all that Russiagate, Ukrainegate, J6gate, documentgate, and a million other frauds were just that.And along the way, the door will be opened for Trump’s team to unravel the #resistance coconspirators in the US government.  We may never see one of them prosecuted, but if they are all banished from government – the term is “debarred” which is not just for lawyers – by the tens of thousands America will be better off for a very long time.Hell, if we get 1,000,000 illegals deported this year, the impact on the US economy and crime rates will be staggeringly positive.  Will we get every illegal kicked out?  Probably not.  But if the border state of emergency does anything, it creates the opportunity to go into Mexico and start killing the drug cartel leaders by the thousands.Drone operators do their jobs about of places like TX and AZ striking targets in Syria.  Just think how much easier that gets in the same time zone…I would not underestimate the wrath of Trump on that assassination attempt, in particular.  They nearly killed him, killed two of his supporters, and thank God his family was not on that stage with him.Everyone knows the FBI and CIA were behind that.  I think there will be considerably less mercy for those people.

            They will always accuse you of doing what they either are doing or recently did.They’re not wrong about the oligarchy, just the timing of it, which has been around for decades with their full knowledge and support.  Nobody had a problem with the oligarchy when it was banning people from speaking truths about the regime and the hoaxes since 2016.  In a lot of ways their use of the oligarchy for their own personal gains will again backfire on them…because (like Elon and Zuck) the oligarchs are now going public with all the stuff the Gummint “forced” them to do.Heck, the whole TikTok thing is basically a war over a platform that the IC does not control.  Now that Twitter and apparently Fakebook are now free, what happens to TikTok is less important.  But it was one of the few, maybe the only, widely used social media platform in America not under the boot of the CIA.

            Libtards just worship power, they don’t care about anything else. It wasn’t an oligarchy when all these same tech guys + many more rich people were supporting Biden in 2020. It’s similar to how they claim to support democracy while supporting their political opponents being crushed by any means necessary. It’s all about preserving their post WW2 hegemony, which they (rightly or wrongly) view Trump as a threat to.

            There will never be forgiveness in this country about COVID until there’s a reckoning about what was done and who was responsible for doing it.Good for Trump to reinstate all the military kicked out because they refused the vax.  I know a couple of them, and they’ve been denied reinstatement since 2022.  That all changed today…with back pay.Hopefully, he can get RFK Jr. across the finish line.  He’s being put exactly where I thought he should be put, and if he does 1/2 of what he promises, we’re going to see some shocking stuff come out about COVID, vaccines in general, and the regulatory capture of the FDA, Ag Dept, and others.

        “The Trump agenda is far more aggressive this time around”Agree with the essay. Trump is prepared this time around (the first time he wasn’t even expecting to win). And so he has clearer plans, a timetable (I guess), an idea of how to implement the plans, and his people in place. I’m not sure how much more aggressive his agenda is this time, though. Trump himself — once you get past the bluster and bravado — is not an aggressive man himself, but diffident and rather cautious. Which I welcome. Team Biden has been composed of reckless lunatics and I’m glad they’re being flushed down the toilet.

                    I’m convinced that the real command and control system of our society is modeled on the money laundering schemes the oligarchs and drug cartels use. There are probably multiple layers of control and Bathhouse Barry is maybe the 2nd layer but takes his orders from the 3rd one. Who knows how far the rabbit hole ultimately goes or which oligarch is ultimately at the top.

                Speaker Johnson told a story in an interview the other day when Biden had no clue about an executive order he (Biden) had just signed.  Johnson claims he wondered at the time just who was in charge.

            The Trump agenda is more aggressive this time because a) they arrested him on almost 100 felony counts and tried to assassinate him, and b) because he is now a lame duck and the midterms are only two years away.

                The Bidet(Obama) Administration has done probably irrevocable damage to the US. Trump should use the Bidet precedent to pressure the Rs. If they won’t act, use Barry’s “pen and phone” tactic to get his way, and Bidet’s tactic of ignoring courts until the SC speaks, then change a couple words here and there and reissue the EO.
If he does so, it’s at least plausible that he can get everyone right of Romney into the polls for midterms, which includes many “former” Ds, who, as with Reagan, saw the writing on the wall.

            We’re already seeing that in his rhetoric about CRIMINAL illegal aliens, which is the entire focus of his speeches now.  Not all illegals, just the gangs and murderers and so forth.  Deportations of regular illegals will take a back seat, and killing off MS-13 and TdA will get the main focus.  Regular illegals will wind up self-deporting if he does a few things right like taxing remittances.  A bill out of Congress that say basically, “We’re going to genetically test you.  If we have to deport you, you will be placed forever on the banned list.  If you leave on your own, you might have a chance down the road of returning.”Anyway, he’s being very strategic which is good to see.  Like the State of Emergency declaration which gives basically unlimited power to the FedGov (e.g. COVID) to deal with illegals.  He can also likely end birthright citizenship if he declares the past 4 years to have been an invasion.  The Constitution did not intend to give citizenship to the children of invading armies.  At some point, that might well be the path he takes to unravel the 14th Amendment.

        Yes. The days of hero worship are over. Today is just another day for us. We must use our energy wisely. Punishing the economic elites via public shaming like what happened with H1B and now with Rufo telling White men to go get a job managing the GAE’s international food court and be content with it is essential. We must figure out how to do it, with a small fraction of our energies.The real work in the interregnum is building redoubts, bolstering home schooling, and building and consuming art and entertainment by and for Our people.The Regime is not rolling back the pogrom. It will continue. The GAE must outcompete China for control of Africa. The GAE winning means Whites losing even more than we already have in the past 70 years.Never forget 2000 – 2024. Pass the mosque and remember that we went to fight them over there so “We” could win. See the racial-Bolshevism everywhere and remember that we were dispossessed so that, “We”, could win the Cold War. Do not get sucked in to fighting for Western Civilization in the Levant or “Us” struggling to defeat China so that, “We” can win. Like the previous two great imperial struggles they are designed so that We will lose. Unlike Rome there are no veteran’s colonies, land grants, military status, identity celebration and bolstering honors and pensions. There aren’t even minor rewards for imperial victory. Those go to non-citizens in this empire. There will only be more dispossession, less land, less territory, more takeaways to give others handouts, and more of what should be ours going to an ever expanding and voracious set of client groups.All is not lost if we focus on our future. Today is just another day. We know the road ahead. We use a manageable reserve of energy spent making sure the system does not absolutely steamroll us. The bulk of what we have must be spent building what comes next for us and our posterity.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytr1xF_iKcU&amp;pp=ygUHQWFydm9sbA%3D%3D

        I see what you did there:
Instaurationwas a monthly magazine published between December 1975 and February 2000 by white supremacist Sumner Humphrey Ireland, under the pen-name “Wilmot Robertson…The magazine was described as being hostile to African-Americans, Jews, immigrants, and the LGBT community.[3][4][5] Mitch Berbrier, in an article titled “Impression Management for the Thinking Racist”, described the magazine as an attempt “to present an intellectualized rhetoric of racism and white supremacy”.

        Fine, fine. The rhetoric will simmer down, the psychos will be chained to their desks, and neighborhoods won’t go up in smoke. All well and good. But will the fundamental, anti-white nature of the Power Structure be altered? Will AINO begin morphing back into a European nation after its decades-long Africanization? Or will that Africanization be quietly cemented into position?
I’d like to imbibe the white philter, but I’m afraid the black sorcery will continue its mesmeric malefeasance largely unabated. While the Trumpist epiphenomenon is good, the deep structures are still hideously morbid.

            It took decades to get to this point, it will take decades to get out. If ever. Record levels of nonwhite immigrants in the past 30 years are here to stay. Lower white birthrates will take decades to reverse. Once you have mixed a quart of vanilla ice cream with a quart of dogshit, you can’t make the ice cream taste good ever again.I always thought it was unrealistic to expect anyone to “Make America Great Again,” let alone Trump.But that is not to say Trump will be completely ineffectual. He is basically like an EMT pulling up to a car wreck in an ambulance. He’s not a Level I trauma surgeon, and even if the patient lives he might be fucked up for life and never return to prime health.But the first order of business is to stanch the bleeding and stabilize the patient so he doesn’t die right here and now on the side of the road. That’s all we can expect for right now.

                If non-white immigrants came, they are not necessarily bound to stay. That sort of despair is about being locked in the Boomer Room for too many decades. If they came, they can go back. Yes, the mulattos will need to be dealt with separately. But even what 400 years out, there is substantial “obviously of African descent only” population. We won’t have an endless population of mixed race people to deal with.

                    This is one of the things the black-pillers don’t talk about. A fairly large percentage of today’s immigrants (legal or otherwise) are opportunists more than “poor, tired, huddled masses” and all the rest of the Giant Green Metal Jewess bullshit. Indians, for instance, just tend to be greedy, lazy Brahmin caste types who were quite comfortable in India but prefer the higher pay they get writing bad Python code in Amerika. If the DIE scam really is ending a lot will get back on the plane. A lot of the lower class immigrants are supposedly already self-deporting based merely on Trump’s bluster about deportations. If he actually follows up, even a little bit, more will follow.

            No way of knowing, but at least we have some segment of people who know what the problem is, are willing to talk about it, and aren’t blinded by insipid Reagan worship or veneration of conservative ideology. And it doesn’t take a lot of people to change things.

            Well we all know we are not going to voot our way out of what’s coming. But let us not ignore the tectonic shifts that are taking place – it’s easy to lose sight of them because in this day of 30 second attention spans…these changes are glacial in nature and seem to take forever.Weimar America is facing the same inevitable course of events that Weimar Germany did. There are still vast areas for the pervs, the zionists, and carpet baggers to take refuge in. California springs to mind but even there – the heat is being cranked up to 11. Our enemies CANNOT run a viable family, never mind a community or a nation. Sure – they can fake it… for awhile. But inevitably they are their own worst enemies and and will fall victim to their lunatics, perverts, incompetents and carpet baggers. We’ve been seeing this in the last couple weeks. Nobody in their right minds can condone what they are doing. Biden is releasing blood thirsty killers from prison, giving medals to criminals and crazies, and throwing sand in the gears of the nation that will hurt everyone including themselves. Normies and grillers are seeing it too. The propaganda machine is laying off and downsizing, shitlib white women are being murdered and raped by migrants, the pervs and pedos are attacking their children, and their husbands, sons and fathers are losing their jobs thanks to suicidal economic policies. The military families are watching their sons shipped off to foreign shitholes to fight and die for nothing, patriot servicemen are being denied advancement to promote DEI morons…in short, the wheels are coming off. Real, concrete antisemitism is beginning to set up which is a good sign.As our Blog Host said, there are massive, irresistable forces coming into play, old foundations and cornerstones of the Old Order are crumbling… and something HAS to give… sooner, rather than later.In times like these, patience and persistence are the highest virtues a Dissident can develop.

            The blacks are not ironically the problem at this point. It’s us having to cope as the flipping UN at the Federal level. American blacks at least might have some investment into American blacks. That’s even allowing for massive corruption.  Who do we think Vivek is invested in? Musk?

        I voted the straight Republican ticket, for one reason, and one reason only. So far, I haven’t heard of any Republican promoting “gender affirming care”. Now, I have no doubt that in a few years, most Republicans will be on board with “gender affirming care”, and the next Republican president will be bragging about how her version of “gender affirming care” is much better and more efficient than that of those icky Democrats.
I’m sort of hoping that I don’t live long enough to see that day. But that day will come.

                The right would do well to abandon transgenderism too. That is pushing women into male roles, including leadership and the military. We maybe have discovered where the average human cries “uncle”. But the lefties and the righties do agree that women can be men and men can be women if they just want to bad enough.

                They did abandon pederasty—not in fact, but in “optics.” When I was a kid, NAMBLA was a near-mainstream liberal-reformist organization, prominent at every march for fill-in-the-blank liberation. By the time South Park made fun of them, most people my age thought Trey Parker made it up. Even those who remember don’t really remember. For decades, NAMBLA wastheface of the left’s sex crusade.Now it’s the troons. I think the regimecan’tabandon them. They’re too visible, too empowered, too important to the project, and too integral to the surveillance/censorship apparatus—whose open reign isbeing inaugurated today.Trannies are prominent at every RNC event. No one who honestly speaks against them is.

                Abandoning the trans agenda = nada. Just a feint, a deke.
The trans are miniscule in number. The trans have not destroyed the nation and culture the past half-century. The Woke and the Feminists did that; they are the real evil, and by strong majority they are female.
Why aren’t they brought to heel, or at least identified as the enemy? Well that’d hurt muh princesses’ feewings and career prospects, doncha know! So the country rots.

        ‘In Trump’s first term, for example, the crazies shut down Washington over Kavanaugh, but this time they were quite muted over Hegseth’Oh, the Raging Hens had their fine day with him.  How I wish they really were ‘muted’.  Then you might have a chance.‘The freakshow that has been the norm for the last decade is being replaced with a sober minded standard.’I doubt that seriously.  And the Freakshow has been normed for over 50 years, not ten.  Quite a difference.  They are the Establishment, deeply dug in and institutionalized.Donald is an Eighties-liberal . . . an early Prog.  The Woke and the Feminists run every U.S. institution and are the very base of the Left and the Deep State.  Progressiveness has been the Law of the Land since the Seventies, enshrined in federal, state, and municipal codes.  It would take a dedicated martial administration to budge these people and their organizations.  The new president is a businessman, not a warrior.The enemy is being ‘replaced’ by sober–mindedness . . . because Donald Trump?  Yeah!  Yeah!  No.

                    Or else it makes a lot of sense.  Kavanaugh reminded the harpies of their hen-pecked, beta male husbands, the kind of guy they felt they could easily bring to heel.  Hegseth, on the other hand, is the kind of guy who would give them the back of his hand, so they stayed at arms’ length.

                    Kavanaugh’s nomination came at the zenith of the DIE/woke/sisterhood/resistance hysteria. I remain optimistic that this particular flame has exhausted its ability to spread further…the fire has burned back over itself.
The Left burned its credibility to ashes with Kavanaugh.  No attacks since then have had any effect.

Girls’ soccer teams and cocoa on cold nights.  O yeah he’s a specimen all right!  :O)The harpies had the soft boy in tears, snuffling and sniffling on national teevee.  Beclowned and emasculated himself with the cameras running.  These are the ‘men’ I’m supposed to believe are on my side and fight for me.Hegseth is made of much sterner stuff.

        I dunno. fellas. All I ever hear is that everything is fake and gay, we will never, never EVER be a nation of laws, due process because the fix is in and we are all doomed. The Cloud People are firmly allied against us, we can do nothing to thwart their evil lies and designs…blah blah blah.All the boy scout needs to start his campfire is a spark. It doesn’t matter how small, how feeble. He’ll set it up so that spark alights on small tinder that will take to flame with a dirty look. And the boy will make sure there is lots of it for that feeble spark to land on. Once he has flames, he will blow so gently on it that the spark can set the tinder aflame – and he is off to the races. Once he has fire that kid can roast hotdogs, marshmallows and even ward off the cold of the night.Some of us here are sparks, like our Esteemed Blog Host – some are tinder. The Cloud People are the big logs that will produce the heat, light and energy that will drive off the damp and gloom. Some of those logs are damp like Zuck and Elon… but, if you put enough heat under them they will burn too.From all of us up here in Canada and especially Alberta – good job, you guys. Take the win – regardless of how small it may seem. Do the work. Keep the heat on. Feed the fires and be sure to take the odd rest to enjoy the warmth as well.This is a good day for you guys.

                    Blackpill isn’t necessarily game-ending. You just need to include some vision, some action items, some reason to believe those actions are likely to make things better for your progeny.
Mustache Man is a great example. And a cautionary tale about taking it too far…

            No, the 70’s are not back. They never will be in my opinion. In 1975, our second worse President, Carter, walked the inaugural parade waving to the cheering crowd that lined the route—much like the Rose Bowl parade. Today, the street in front of the White House is closed to traffic. The current inauguration was scheduled outside, but closed to view/attendance with the exception special seating by Congress and select invitees. Ordinary citizens were to be kept back and their access to the process fenced off—those in power specifically guarded from their constituents.Ordinary citizens are not even allowed into the Capital building and White House “tours” are via select issued passes by their government overlords. I visited Washington DC in my youth. I remember walking past the White House to line up on the driveway for tour admittance—no pass needed. Ditto Capital building. Those were the days where our elected were not afraid of us, nor despised by us.It should be obvious to all that this is the final days of the GAE under siege. No, this is not the 70’s.

        There isn’t an ounce of disagreement with your take. This is the bottom line although a tweak is in order:There is another bit of evidence to suggest that the reason Trump is in Washington right now is the economic elites shifted in his favor.These economic elites remain somewhat rogue and schismatic, and a substantial portion of the old guard has yet to follow their direction. For good or ill, the arising elite represent a major departure from what preceded them. It probably isn’t an exaggeration at all to write the post-war world consensus is done. Whether that is a good thing for us or a bad thing for us remains to be seen. Given what happened over the last eighty years, though, optimism is not misplaced; I have a bit now. Trump will not do jack shit, nothing changes at the ballot box and the demographic realities grow worse daily, yet not only are the brakes being tapped, the bus is starting to run around. What we previously endured has ended but there is a strong chance what lies ahead will not be as hellish as it easily could have been.

            There is another bit of evidence to suggest that the reason Trump is in Washington right now is the economic elites shifted in his favor.A vital downstream consequence of this was the dampening of vote fraud. If the Sea Island Group and other members of the globalist cartel had decided to cheat him this time, like they tried unsuccessfully in 2016 and successfully in 2020, then he would have lost. Downballot fraud was still widespread.Not all of the various components of the fraud machine either obeyed orders or were under control of the globalist elements who decided that Pres. Trump was the lesser of the two evils (from their perspective). There was still footage of Africans unloading boxes of ballots out of cars with California plates, in Pennsylvania, etc.

        More great observations Z man.   There is also the point that Trump was allowed to win the election.  Biden “won” in 2020 with 83 million votes.  Trump won this time with about 76 million.  So the premise that the election was to big to rig is not true, he was allowed to win.Also note that the elites were not shy about stealing many of the down ballot races.   The GOP lost at least four Senate seats due to election shenanigans.   So it appears that maybe the elites were actually afraid for their positions and maybe for the position of the Empire itself if Kamala had won.   Not sure that Trump will be able to help with that last part.

        Trump is the political equivalent of an umbrella which is being used by someone walking around Chernobyl two days after the explosion. The umbella will protect you from rain, the effects of the sun, and maybe radioactive dust but it is not designed to counter the aggressively damaging energy that’s being released into the blasted landscape.

        Got some good primers by the comments today. I had to watch the speech. The Clintons almost didn’t applaud Trump’s entry and gave just a tiny two claps. Biden was sneering and smiling the entire time.Of course, hispanics and blacks were thanked and then named again in a promise to work with them in the coming years.I don’t know. That kind of was a wrap for me. It isn’t that I hate them. It is that this country seems to be all about everybody but Americans. I did enjoy the part about acknowledging who Americans are and what our ancestors did to build this country and to bring it to its apex in the 50s and its fullest technological expression with Apollo in the 60s despite the Revolution that pulled her down around that event.That is a part of me that feels that maybe that happened because we were focused on the stars, while our homeland was opened for invasion, our institutions subverted and our moral and social fabric torn to shreds.Are we going to be open to jackals and hyenas as we look to colonize Mars? I am not a luddite. I like logic. Can profligacy to keep an economy cranking and building and flying rockets solve our biggest problem? The incoherency and unsolved problems of a multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracy that has attacked its core, patriotic citizenry?I feel a bitter anger and contempt that is warranted for the empire that has destroyed Our country has turned its back on and declared Americans the enemy. I would expect some explicit acknowledgement of that fact. It didn’t come. I wanted something from that speech that called out and renounced the anti-White bigotry and animus that has gripped this country for decades and that Blinken/Mayorkas/Obama/Garfinkle et al openly declared along with all of corporate America, Hollywood … …It didn’t come. Look. America is a colony – a multi-colony by definition and by fact. We, Heritage Americans, need to rethink our position here since it has been rethought for us. We must blaze a path forward where we carve out areas where our posterity has a future filled with dignity and honor. We must treat America’s carcass the way our enemies do but do it with honor. Your job at corporate America is you colonizing it and taking that wealth back to your home that will someday be a foreign domicile of for and by you. Your business venture will only enhance your locale and when you extract wealth it will be from a venture that is outside your redoubt. You like every other group here, will take that profit and plunder and plow it back in to your locale so that over time it can grow and flourish.This speech and the setting said it all. It is time to get over the disappointment. It is time to accept that I am an American but America is gone. It is time to look to and build the future. It is time to stop lamenting that I live in their post-America and time to start building Our post-America.

                The fact that he didn’t means there IS a limit to a preemptive pardon.  That makes it easier for SCOTUS to toss the pardons in order to limit it to known crimes, convictions, and indictments.  Otherwise, a POTUS could order mass executions and then pardon everyone.

            I know the president has broad powers to pardon but I don’t see how that includes the power to pardon people who have not been convicted of a crime or even investigated for one, and I don’t see how someone who accepts this pardon does so without any sort of admission of guilt for their criminal behavior. The entire thing seems so nonsensical, but that’s Brandon for you.

                Not all the blame lies with Biden. Ford opened the door with Nixon and Watergate shenanigans. The jump from investigation to actual indictment was *never* made (formally at least). So it was a “short step” to take by Biden to issue a pardon for crimes not yet known or under investigation Ala Fauci.
Thus we’ve made the President a King of sorts who is not only “above” the law, but *is* the law. Only with a King, his successor can reinstitute criminal charges and with some hope for future justice.

                Think of the preemptive pardons like Harry Reid using the “nuclear option”.  The Left came up with that genius plan in order to get a few judges past the filibuster.  They did this on the short-sighted idea that they would always be in power and that Republicans would not quickly weaponize it once in power.And then Republicans won the House, Senate, and Presidency, and quickly used the nuclear option allowing Trump to remake the Federal judiciary.  For a little short term gain, Harry Reid put a hand grenade on a timer and handed it to Democrats.  It later blew up in their faces.Unintended consequences.The preemptive pardons are like this.  Conservatives need to stop bitching about it and realize that Biden just gave them a YUUGE gift.

            Hell, he just pardoned the rest of his crooked family:
(Warning, CNN)https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/politics/joe-biden-preemptive-pardons/index.html
President Joe Biden on Monday issued an extraordinary slate of preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump and members of his own family, using executive prerogative as a shield against revenge by his incoming successor while also guaranteeing his closest relatives aren’t subject to future prosecutions.

            Those pardons are a poison pill for the recipients.  They can’t refuse to answer questions in a subpoena without rejecting the pardon.  If they retain the pardon, they have to answer all the questions they are asked – truthfully – or face prosecution for perjury and obstruction of justice.People are vastly overthinking the impact of those preemptive pardons.  There’s also zero protection for the people underneath them.  Fauci had employees at NIH for example, and a pardon doesn’t protect anyone at FDA or CDC.  Nor does it protect the Russiagate coup plotters or people like Cong. Alex Vindman who was part of the Ukraine fraud.  Nor the J6 and documents prosecution and LawFare marionette puppeteers.The best defense they all had was to plead the 5th and hope they could ride silence into retirement.  Now they’re going to have to come up with millions of dollars defending themselves in endless court battles and grand juries and Congressional hearings.

        It feels like the #resistance met its end on the day the bullet whizzed past Trump’s ear. It is like the normal people in the deep state realized that the lunatics are out of control and things need to change. Since that moment, it feels like we have had this massive shift not just in politics and rhetoric but also in the culture.I know that these cultural shifts will bring on hangers-on and phonies, and to be sure the past few weeks it has been obnoxious to see all these people now say they love Trump. But as we all know, most people are just going along to get along. A guy like Zuckerberg was useful for the liberals in their 2020 fortifications and they can be useful to this side now.

This only ends when explicitly white-focused networks and shows come into being.  That may seem unfathomable to us at this precise moment, but given the current cultural momentum it can’t be completely ruled out.

        Somewhat tangential question but I have never heard a good answer for it: if everybody powerful was behind the Clinton machine in 2016, why not also back in 2008, when she was younger and less tarnished by scandal? Why in 2020 did the DNC put up the ex-VP Biden and not some shrill Clinton clone? Surely the Clintons had groomed some Democrat hopefuls.
Despite the golden tongue, Obama should have been one of those curious candidates like Howard Dean or Bernie Sanders, who made a splash but ultimately lost to The Machine.

            In my youth, I heard a Buchanan person describe Washington as a big small town made up of many small towns. The permanent party leaders are one such small town, but they interface with the big factions in their party, like the Clinton machine or the Bush machine. These machines come and go. Permanent Washington always had a mixed relationship with the Clinton machine. They blamed Hillary for the health care debacle and the subsequent midterm blowout.As far as 2008, Clinton had the support of Washington and its money raising mechanism. Team Obama tapped into new money, Silicon Valley, which is what kept him going early in the primary seasons. Incompetence can overcome money and we saw that with Hillary. Her team badly bungled Super Tuesday by not understanding the rules for delegate allocation. This foreshadowed 2016, where her team forgot how the electoral college worked.Hillary Clinton is a great example of the difference between clever and smart. Clever is getting out of a jam, while smart is avoiding the jam. She is also the example of how first rate people attract first rate people, but second rate people attract third rate people.

            It may have been as simple as the Ds in 2008 not yet having mastered the rigging of their primaries, which they’ve been doing ruthlessly ever since. For example, by the primary rules they have been using ever since, Clinton would have won the 2008 CA primary. She did win more total votes in the CA primary in 2008 than did The Precious. But he won more counties. And in 2008, by the rules of the time, it was the one who won the most counties who was the winner. Thus was the nomination decided. He may have sort of squeaked through in a way that the PTB didn’t expect, roughly analogous to how Trump did in 2016.

                This is a good point.  The vote rigging is a blunt instrument, due to the riggers being a loose, uncoordinated group.  As Zman has alluded to before, they are a flock of birds doing what they think are in the party’s interest, not a group of soldiers following explicit orders from central command.  So there can be miscalculations along the way.  I’m sure there was plenty of fraud in 2024, but the fraudsters were frauding in the dark, not sure of the totals they needed.

                    Vote rigging, or cheating has been the norm forever.  Nixon would have won in 1960 had it not been for Illinois shenanigans.  The big change was the scamdemic that allowed illegal changes to occur wrt voting rules in key States.  To this day, not one has explained why there were so many Biden votes in the 2020 election and the return to “normalcy” today.  Anywhere from 7M to 15M votes/voters magically appeared, then disappeared for this election.  An anomaly never explained adequately, nor pursued appropriately.

                    I don’t think the loose, uncoordinated group model holds. If it did, there’s no excuse for it failing pretty much everywhere this time. It’s not like Rs could have monitored all the ballots in every county of every swing state. The “suitcase of ballots” switcheroo could easily have been keptsub rosaby being pulled off by the janitors or “janitors”.
Don’t get thrown off by the amateurishness of the obviously faked signatures. This was not a failed op. This was an amazing success — vote rigging to any sizable extent has now been deemed “fake news”.

        “The freakshow that has been the norm for the last decade is being replaced with a sober minded standard.”Ratchet effect comes to mind here.A loud and rowdy drunk is “taken care of” by tossing him for the night in jail—been there, done that—only to get drunk the next weekend and repeat the process.  So my question is, how do we *reverse* the losses we had during the Trump 1 and Biden 1 Presidencies?  Holding ground is not enough.Without such reversal, it’s only time before the ratcheting renews—and as with a boa constrictor and its prey, we finally suffocate.

            At best, it will be one step forward, two steps backward. Maybe a few of the policies will be reversed somewhat so it looks like progress (or regress), but it will then move in the desired direction (maybe Biden was seen as too much, too fast, so need to adjust the temp a bit).
Better than a Harris regime?  I suppose so, but only because the destruction will take longer.

It looks to me like we’re entering the inexterminable reign of a class so deluded and stupid they can’t tell God and chatbots apart—or Wernher von Braun from an Indian hotel cashier.

If so, the next step back will be infinite.

            At a minimum, he should double down on the weaponization of the law.  CRUSH THEM!  Absolutely no holds barred.  Sick the justice department on them.  Get GOP governors to do the same in the states.  A failure to do this will result in the democrats doubling down when they inevitably get power again.  They need to suffer the consequences of their stupid ideology.Dismantle everything possible and get Congress to enact some of the things he is accomplishing with executive orders (which can be undone just as easily as he did them) to make them as permanent as possible.  If the GOP weren’t a bunch of cucks, this would be easy.  Remove the protected legal status of their pet groups.  Make it a felony to employ or house any alien.You are absolutely correct.

But the GOP IS a bunch of cucks.  Not ten actual men in the whole bunch.
Add to that a bunch of ‘conservative’ feminist women who are only conservative for purposes of duping stoopid Rightie men.  Very much like the parade of blonde bimbos that FOX used to trot out to keep weak Rightie men on the leash.

        Z is right that a lot of people seemed relieved that there is now a sense of normalcy. However, I don’t think that had much to do with why Trump was allowed to win and the election was not stolen again.In 2016, the biggest issues for Big Jew were primarily domestic. They especially wanted the Great Replacement to proceed on steroids and WOKE to be solidified. There of course were international issues and Trump saying no regime change wars was unacceptable to the Deep State.In 2024 Trump realized that the biggest issue for Big Jew was Israel and Trump ran as the most pro Israel candidate. Plus the Republicans showed that they were even more in favor of censorship of dissent against Israel than the democrats.If it wasn’t for the fraud, the 2020 election may have had the same result. This time though Trump seems shrewder so who knows?

        They seem to be biding their time and waiting for opportunities.  Some of just over the top insane though.  Here is an NPR article I saw this morning taking taking Biden’s declaration that the ERA is law seriously.  The crazies really think this is going to happen.  Perhaps one plan to tie up the courts in all sorts of insanity that it bogs down everything else, including deportations.

        The #resistance has been quiet because they are out of weapons.  They went all in on the fascism lie, and then Trump won, and all that stuff quickly died down.  That left all their lunatic supporters standing around wondering, “So, that was like all bullshit??”  Yes, my dear lunatic, it was all bullshit.  Once they tried two assassination attempts, the #resistance was dead.  They shot every bullet, bomb, and ballistic missile in their warehouse and none of it worked.And yes, they’re also out of money.  Nobody will be bankrolling #resistance v2.0.During his speech today, Trump made it clear that the sins of the past will be rectified.  And the pardons by Biden – just like the assassination attempt and the fascism lie – will redound to Trump’s benefit.The people pardoned now have no defense against a subpoena.  And there are puh-lenty of coconspirators who can be targeted.  How much do you think those people are going to cover for the likes of Fauci, Miley, Cheney, McCord, etc.?  They’re going to sign like canaries…especially since Trump now has access to ALL of their data from the past 8 years and a team that appears ready to use it.200+ executive orders will be issued today.  Bank on Trump keeping as many of his promises as he can, and clearing the decks of the #resistance so that in 2028 JD Vance has open field running to continue the Trump agenda.

            Sheeit, these are the same folks who are capable of staging a global plandemic if need be. But as we’ve been over here quite a bit, the oligarchs switched horses because the Biden camp crossed them somehow, or it was determined that he/it was no longer capable of maintaining the appearance of legitimacy. (Some of both probably) What we’re seeing presently and in the near future is the true capability of the “resistance” when it lacks oligarch support. Biden’s bitching about the “oligarchy” was in fact just bitching that they no longer supported him.The seating arrangements at the inauguration today told you just about everything you need to know about the new power structure and who is backing whom, both literally and figuratively. Seated directly behind the Trump family, Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai, and Cook.

            We’re both speculating, but I suspect that if the people who funded the riots and resistance of Trump’s first term wanted, presumably Soros and his kin, they could pay the same people to do a repeat performance with the same numbers and the same energy.
They chose not to do so because the left has been too sympathetic to the Palestinians after Oct 7.  Social media made it clear how widespread the sympathy was.
That’s most of the explanation, in my opinion.

                The big donors have been flocking to Trump since before the election.  And the rest have been sucking up ever since.  There’s a chance they could have tried something but consider this:Trump won the youth vote and greatly expanded his vote with blacks and “Hispanics”.They have far fewer foot soldiers this time.  And those that remain are still reeling from the realization that they were lied to by their own leaders.  Harris was never popular, and she really had no chance.  I wouldn’t underestimate the damage the “fascism” thing caused because the next day every single Dem leader immediately dropped it.Devastating.I wrote about this back in Nov on this black.  There are no shock troops left outside of the die hards.  The Palis and the recent terror attack in New Orleans killed whatever public sentiment to rally against Trump that might have been left.

            I think Gaetz pissed off too many people in the party. His departure from Congress looks like banishment. He goes into the wilderness for a while and then maybe runs for Governor of Florida or maybe his old House seat.

                I would be a somewhat proud Floridian with Gaetz as governor. DeSantis is OK despite being a huge Israel shill. Gaetz seems to have some genuine teeth, and looks like a movie star rather than a hack with platform shoes. Normally I think competent people are better in governor’s positions than on Capitol Hill, but since Gaetz is a photogenic firebrand, I wonder if he isn’t better suited to being a megaphone in Washington.

                    The timing of Gaetz’ exile and the end of DeSantis current term line up pretty well.
It’s imperative that Florida and Texas remain red as counterweights to California, New York, and Illinois. Just imagine how awful Beer Flu would have been if FL and TX were blue states.

            Basically all 4D claims are BS, but there seems to have been more at play here than underestimating the opposition. Bondi and Gaetz are very close, and while I never put too much stock in women, I have been told by someone who knows her that she is very, very ruthless and calculating. If you recall, it didn’t take a nanosecond to name her as Gaetz’ replacement. Maybe she simply had been pegged as a fallback but there seems more there.
