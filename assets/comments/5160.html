        If they think that people stayed home rather than vote for Mitt, wait until they try and run Jeb. I won’t vote for him. I will write in someone and throw my vote away. Same thing with Kasich. So they just might want to reconsider pushing Trump out of the race. That’s about the only way they have a chance of winning the next election. I’m done with the lies.

        All these people want to be President, but do any of them really know why? A political party with O’Rourke’s credo–we don’t want to know how to make Washington work, we want know how to make it stop–would accomplish much more good in a loss than winning will with another wanker.

        I also have given up on the Republicans.
What I am waiting for is the Rope Party.  One convention, in Washington DC.  Election the next day.
Yes?

        Henry Dampier sounds just like the Z Man!FromDon’t Criticize the GOP for Performing Its Function:“The purpose of the GOP is to run interference for the left to make it easier for said institutional left to administer the state, and through its administration of the state, the rest of the society. Criticizing the GOP for performing its function is confused — there’s no other role for it to play, considering its non-representation in important institutions like government bureaucracies and, more importantly, universities.The GOP functions to contain discontent among the population, to channel it into useless issues, and to tell people what they’re allowed to believe and express without provoking social opprobrium and legal consequences.”Found viaIsegoria, which would fit right in on your blogroll.Bipartisan grand fusion party indeed!Conservatives are at this point political ronin, party-less, world wide!
