        The moral bankruptcy of the US can be seen in the support for the Israeli genocide of Muslims in Gaza. Israel is literally flying drones into refugee tents and blowing off the heads of children. There ain’t a goddamn person within one mile of you who ain’t cheerin’ it on, ‘specially if they got one of them Scofield Bibles mindwashing them. Because Americans have been gelded here at home (and in the UK), they are permitted to channel their rage and fury into non-stop Fox News’ sing-a-longs ofroot, root, for the home team(The Blue and Whites).The US has been reduced a nation of spectators. Watch the sports. Watch the phone. Watch the comic book movie. Watch the protest. Watch Gaza being turned into a pile of ash and think “it’s the right thing to do.”Americans are psychologically ill. We see it in the drugs, the SSRIs, the driving, the degeneracy, the slovenliness, the tattoos, the cynicism, the raw hate directed at politicians, who — after all — will only go so far as they allowed by the masses of their subjects.In these conditions, artistic creation is impossible, unless it comes from a Louis-Ferdinand Celine or a similarly-spirited writer willing to depict this age in all of its demonic, filthy, rotten details. And few want to dwell in that for very long.

There’s that and, TBO, I pay less and less attention to the English-language side of the internet, too. It’s getting harder to find things I actually care about that provides technical information for a problem I encounter. Make a village livable for idiots and, shock and awe, idiots partake.

                I know that YouTube is invaluable for many things, but lately, I’m beginning to have to spend more and more time looking for answers to car problems on home-made videos than I used to. It’s filled with all sorts of two-minute videos made by “Asians” that say absolutely nothing, but are promoted near the top of any results.
Well, the lady that ruined it is now dead, joining her son, so I guess there’s that. Break something and die is the new motto.

                    It is all for more dollars. Show everyone but a white because the market for whites is the smallest market. So, whitey, you have to go. Not enough of you in reality so now we’ll show ruck driver repairmen in you stead.

                        That may be the case globally, but not domestically. Whites are still a plurality in AINO and possess the vast majority of spending bucks. No, what we see with our replacement in AINO is simply an expression of anti-white racism and the desire for a world without the BEID.

                Absolutely. Even in his self-imposed exile Lind Dinh is hands down the best chronicler of the evils of the dying GAE.

            Islamists are detritus, Hamas and their supporters (most of the population) are the enemies of civilization and contribute nothing positive, rather, they are a net negative to the world. You don’t get to do things like murder music festival goers and claim the moral high ground, they can all die.

                Sure, but look at the big picture.  One of my smaller enemies, Islam, is attacking the hideout of my biggest enemy.  The time that the chosen in Western countries spend worrying about Israel is time that isn’t spent persecuting my people.

            You omitted “watch the porn” as the #1 spectator sport of Americans.  I cannot stress enough how this is the elephant in the room of addictive soul crushing and mind twisting hateful rot.  Porn is more than normalized; it is celebrated as aspirational and empowering and authentic.  USA is a Godless society; full stop.

                I admit that even I was a bit surprised that the Republicucks had an Onlyfans whore at their big show. I expect that kind of thing from the Demoncrats but I thought the Goopers were at least still pretending to support Christian morality.

Of course, being based in Jew York, it is their home team. The national news caters to 13% of the New York Metro population with Israel more often than not being one of the top three stories and then they wonder why their viewership keeps shrinking.

        You’ll also notice that Hollywood has pushed a fixation on “childhood trauma” in its character-development bits on teeeeveeeee and movies.  That is to say, the characters spend a lot of time recalling bad stuff that happened to them in their childhood.  Generally those recollections serve as a justification for aberrant (or worse) activities by the character(s).Normal humans may have been exposed to some trauma in childhood, whether alcoholic parent(s), divorce, death of a sibling, (etc.)  But normal humans do not fixate on that, nor do they ‘act out’ in an uncivil manner due to it.But Hollywood script-writers &amp; producers do.  One suspects that they are trying to justify their own solipsistic/aberrant activities.

            Funny you should mention this, but I have noticed this looking at the description of movies. Time and again the main character is “dealing with childhood trauma.” I can honestly say that I have never met anyone who claimed to be dealing with childhood trauma and I have met a lot of people who had tough upbringings. If it comes up at all it is a source of pride.

                        You shouldn’t believe what they say about themselves, especially when they’re claiming weakness.
“We’re so neurotic!” isnota Freudian statement, self-knowledge aimed at self-improvement, but ajudgment against you—a condemnation of the goyishe mind.

                    Male readers copy the character. Boys want to become Batman.Female writers want to make the character a copy of themselves.
I’d include feminine thinkers under “female writers.”Hollywood used to be a meritocracy, but its driving ethnos* reverted to their mean in 3 generations.

            Smart comment. I’d add that it not only applies to fictional drama. Almost every public figure has an “origin story” on tap, about some childhood trauma or revelation that decisively shaped their life course. Often this early life episode (whether real or fabricated) is used to excuse, justify, or even vindicate their bad behavior in the present or recent past.I suspect a large number of people in less visible stations of society also view themselves in this way. But this kind of comic-book determinism is the exact opposite of the older conception of character formation in the individual, in which obstacles, hardship, “trauma,” or even inherited dispositions were seen as the predictable norm in every human life, and a person’s path to maturity was the gradual process of mastering them through the practice of tried and true habits of virtue.

                Also, to apply this to today’s Z-blog column: Modern culture encourages people to be “authentic” and “different” (which, as Zman notes, is a futile exercise). The elder culture encouraged them to be the “same,” to inhabit the role of the virtuous man—in the profound sense that nearly every person could pursue universal standards of moral virtue.
The latter understanding built Western civilization over many centuries. The former is unraveling it within a few generations.

                    Ironically, there is nothing so herd-like as the avant-garde. How “different” is one being by impregnating herself with hideous ink and mutilating herself with metallic acne?
If you wanna be different, you gotta look like the man in the gray flannel suit.

            A therapeutic society avoids certain prescribed questions of right and wrong in lieu of explanations, which really amounts to excuses when all is said and done. Exceptions are made for what goes against the state religion, of course, so, say, racism is presented as evil and the reasons and motivations for it are avoided. Contrast that approach with pedophilia. The race realist never can have a basis for his belief, but the kiddy diddler always will be found to have an excuse. Freud may have been debunked and marginalized, but his influence never waned.

                It quite didn’t wane a bit.  Edward Bernays was his nephew and crated Public Relations aka Propaganda.  The Freuds were at the forefront of psychologically conquering the West regardless of whether Siggy’s theories were in vogue or not.“A therapeutic society avoids certain prescribed questions of right and wrong in lieu of explanations, which really amounts to excuses when all is said and done.”Reminds me of this scene from Sopranos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAplqRcc5I0Ironically, Tony hated the therapy/patient culture himself and longed for an American of Gary Cooper.“The race realist never can have a basis for his belief, but the kiddy diddler always will be found to have an excuse.”Quite so.

            Your comment on Hollywood and childhood trauma makes me think of the TV reality show Survivor, which is one of the only TV network shows we have watched as a family for over 20 years.  After the BLM/George Floyd riots, there was a push for more diversity on TV, which included Survivor.It wasn’t just more diversity on Survivor, but we noticed that most of the cast had a sob story, some kind of trauma in their past that they were trying to overcome.  The cast of the show was suddenly filled with fragile, weak people, especially the white ones.In the past, the show had generally cast people who are interesting or funny, or are accomplished in their field and are the type that people would want to spend time with.

                Yes, I remember Rupert who won on the first show, he admitted at the start he could only make himself useful and friendly because he was chunky and slow, but he won in the end by becoming the “village hunter” who provided necessary food for his group.

            A lot of good comments on this thread. The longhouse society is profoundly unhealthy for men. On top of it the ultimate crime is being committed against you. Your own kind turning against you, dispossessing you, facilitating an endless invasion of your homeland, demonizing and villifying you and then erasing you from your own past to abrogate your claim on your homeland so you can be colonized and ethnically cleansed from it.That is the entire goal of the entire system. The most normal and healthy response is to reject. When defending your land and your sovereignty, the most basic human instinct, is opposed, you are castigated and told you are evil. The moral policing is intense and it is ubiquitous. That is why this is nonstop.Don’t forget that the system is designed this way. It is designed to gaslight and lie to you to do the ultimate harm to you. Of course, the cult members are focused on the good they are doing. They aren’t harming you! They are helping the poor other that you would harm if it weren’t for them. How dare you prevent them from helping those others. How dare you speak out against being invaded. How dare you suggest that this land is yours.So here we are. There is an organization that behaves this way. It is a death cult. Even what we call the celebration parallax is one of the key features of the death cult. At the beginning, they search out the most vulnerable and broken people. They identify the ones who have some outside connection to grounding in reality and to someone who loves them. The cult works to separate those from each other. This makes you isolated and alone. Then they deconstruct you. Then they give you a messianic mission to do good and restore the world and deliver it from evil. Then they use sexual promiscuity to get people locked in to fulfilling their base desires. They are broken slaves, but sating all of their sexual desiresThen comes what we call the celebration parallax. The cult is in a large gathering and in it the leader will say something that violates all norms – something evil. Often, it is suggesting that murder or mass murder for a righteous cause is okay. He says it in a way where the social pressure to go against him is immense. He is scanning the room for any sign of those who might resist doing some great evil. They are to be isolated, worked on or taken out. Those most broken and willing to conform, the true believersThis is being taken to an extreme in England right now. It has been taken to an extreme in America as well. Look at the Dem VP messaging. Hey white man, you can come in but you have to play second fiddle at best and commit all of your energy toward penance that must be done for eternity to gain temporary absolution.It is quite sick but it is right before our very eyes. We live ruled by a death cult whose openly stated aim is our dispossession and destruction. The perfectly and healthy natural human response to being targeted like this is then taken by the most powerful of the abusers and used against us. See! They have anger. How dare they.It is a sick system run by sick individuals. The solution is not psycho therapy. The solutions are older than that, and we know exactly what they are. Do not despair. We grow in number every day, and they can’t control information or nature.

                “The longhouse society”“a death cult.”Crazy whites.While I agree with your observations, you neglect to include that the crazy whites are pawns of a foreign elite, who mostly control our media and government.    Although they certainly want others to die, they are no death cult.  Thoseforeignelites are fighting for the dominance of their group over other groups.The crazy whites have always been with us, but they have been weaponized by theforeignelites.So, we have two problems:  the foreign elites and the crazy whites.  What is the best method of solving these tangled, but distinct, problems?(Related note:  I started reading about the American Transcendalists, which I haven’t researched since I was a teenager.  Emerson and Thoreau were early manifestations of the crazy whites.)

            This is why, IRL, they are always talking about replacing cops with social workers and prisons with mental health facilities and depicting someone commiting violent crime as having a mental health episode.  Other than racists, there are no bad people, just people who are unwell and need a hug.

            Excellent point. And case in point, this weekend I watched 3:10 to Yuma (2007). Believe it or not, it’s actually a rather dramatic improvement over the original (1957). That said, the chief villain (Ben Wade), played by Russell Crowe, late in the film reveals that when he was eight years old his father was murdered over a shot of whisky, and his mother abandoned him. Nothing wrong with including backstory, but it’s wrong to even imply that childhood trauma justifies antisocial pathology in adulthood.

                1957 version – Glen Ford and Van Heflin – was excellent.  Kind of a film noir western (if there is such a thing).  2007 version didn’t make an impression on me.  I now have an excuse to rewatch both.

                    I fully understand and respect your position. However, IMO, the original film was a bit pallid and threadbare. I felt there wasn’t enough meat on the narrative bones. The remake fleshes out the original, and I gotta admit, Crowe is a dam’ good actor. A throwback to when white men weren’t ashamed to be masculine.

        I remember once or twice using the microfiche archives at my local library. I would first go to a giant card catalog and look up some topic and it would refer me to a certain film. Then I would load up that film on a paper and look at it. I did this for some research into papers I wrote in high school and college. I was looking at the exact articles from 50, 60, 100 years ago. It was, truthfully, more of a novelty than anything considering my level of research and expertise, but it was still there. And if my local library in a small town didn’t have the article, I know the bigger county library or a local university would.Obviously, this quickly became obsolete with the invention of the internet. It was thought that this technology can just store everything, forever. And it can. It just doesn’t. It is virtually impossible to find anything written on the Internet older than five years. If it is a highly charged topic, it’s just been subsumed by the companies and search engines. Try finding the insane “cut down the tall trees” articles that the mainstream media wrote in 2020, or all their lockdown propaganda. They just buried it and moved on. They don’t even need a Winston Smith to do it, it’s all handled by algorithms and bots. It is how you can get shitlibs out there saying that there was no lockdowns in 2020 and nobody tried to force you to get vaxxed.It’s just the worst situation imaginable for anybody who isn’t a Year Zero communist, because they can so effectively gaslight you (I know that’s a term that progs use as a synonym for lying, but it’s the right usage here) which of course means it is the best situation for a Year Zero communist, who, as I get older and observe what is going on around me, is like 70%-90% of the regime and its defenders, even if they don’t identify as such. But maybe I am confusing cause and effect, and living on the Internet turns you into a Year Zero communist by design (there was a guy who lived in a cabin in the woods who discussed this).

            And an awful lot of libraries are purging their collections of older books, and that microfiche and microfilm. Their excuse is often that they need to make room for more “accessibility,” more computers for digital resources, more room for “community activities,” blah, blah, blah. Some librarians now call for the outright banning of books that are to the right of Obama or FDR. Their main professional organization has been far-left for many years. A terrible state of affairs. Keep good, old books, especially history and literature, and preserve them for the future.

                The institution of libraries, like everything else, have become a left-wing social engineering operation. Like so many things, the takeover started in the 1970s. If you look at who engineered the takeover, well it’s the usual suspects. But in any case, yea, look at libraries today, look at what the people who advocate forl libraries talk about, it’s not about being a store of knowledge for the present and future generations, it’s about drag queen story hour, putting gay propaganda in the children’s section, having enough computers that the local bums can look at pornography, providing free resources for illegal immigrants, so on and so on. Of course they would destroy old materials, it’s part of the process. And, as with so many other things, the conservatives just cucked out and let it happen.

                    And library “Banned Books Weeks” only highlight left-wing stuff that has been contested. Never, from what I’ve witnessed in many libraries, have they highlighted right-wing books that have been rampantly attacked, censored, cancelled.
The children’s book sections are often horrifying, with LGBT stuff on open display, along with biographies of Obama, Hillary, Sotomayor, and whoever the latest Diversity idol is, without any balance.

                I was thinking that I might want to order some of the old Ian Fleming James Bond novels, but I heard that they were editing the bad words out of them, so I dunno if you can get the originals anymore, and I refuse to buy their edited versions. I wonder if anybody still prints the Flashman books. Probably not for long. But I already read all of them.

                    You can still find such books in some used bookstores. Also Alibris and some other websites sell used stuff. You’d better move fast though. Good luck! I enjoyed the Flashman books too. The author also wrote a great memoir of his time in the British Army in WWII.

                    Loved George MacDonald Fraser, his quote from one of the books about war was great- “the young bucks strutted and boasted, hot for battle and glory, while the old men sipped their drinks by the fire and didn’t say anything at all”.

                High school textbooks if you can find them, that were printed prior to 1965, for English grammar, English Lit, History, geography and mathematics. Home economics, books on etiquette, old Betty Crocker cookbooks. Children’s story books like the older versions of the Little Golden Books. For tweens, the Beany Malone series of books is interesting.

                    Good points!  I’ve saved some pre-World War II history textbooks on the USA and England which are still very good, and a 1950’s literature textbook that is very worthwhile.  I used it recently for some research I was doing.
Speaking of series of children’s books, I read not long ago that the Little House on the Prairie books were being attacked, for ridiculous leftist reasons, of course.  That’s the kind of thing that will encourage wacko librarians to get rid of them.

                    Can verify. I had a 1963 edition of a sort of a history textbook for middle graders. It was every Presidential administration in a Reader’s Digest format, it even had a picture and quote of JFK on the preface page.
That thing was a gold mine and a blast to read. Quips, quotes, cartoons, in such detail that I would’ve passed as a Constitutional scholar in cuckservative comment sections. I could’ve given even Severian a run for his money.
One of my great regrets, amongst many.

                About 15 years ago the Journal of the ALA ran an editorial by a librarian in Lowell, Massachussets who argued that every book published before 1960 should be purged from library collections because of the isms. And the publishers of the journal offered no rebuttal. These are the sorts of maniacs we’re dealing with. Perhaps she’s a descendant of a witch.

Definitely a spiteful mutant, at the least.
That’s such a horrendous story for those of us who love learning, but there are so many examples like that.  “No rebuttal.”  I shouldn’t be surprised, but it still makes my blood boil.  We might have to go back to “subscription libraries” like in the old days.

                This is one reason why I put up with the hassle of being on the board of directors at my town’s public library.  I can very directly impact what’s offered – andnotoffered – to the few youth who still patronize the library.  And it’s a good way to snatch up the old history volumes that they remove from circulation.

            “It just doesn’t. It is virtually impossible to find anything written on the Internet older than five years.”
I’d maintain that’s because your “search engine” is inadequate to the task.  Try some of the AI attempts such as ChatGPT.  Unless they have not been fed such information (and this is a known problem), a well formed question(s) might bring out references to currently hard to find information.

                        Trust, but verify.  We’ve been over this before.  In this “new age” critical thinking is essential—and perhaps even more so than IQ.  Both CT and IQ are related to a certain degree, but not nearly enough to make them synonymous with each other.
The “problem” with this group, is that we by and large demonstrate great skill in CT.  So like a fish that does not know it swims in water, folks here don’t know how much they practice such in their daily traverse through clown world.

        Looking into the past is the only way to ensure continuity of our people. It’s a way to see what worked, what didn’t work and who should not be allowed in our society, because of their never ending subversive and destructive tendencies.

            And yet we continue to let them in bringing their subversive and destructive tendencies into our schools our businesses our hospitals and our court rooms. White Z said even our art, dance, theater, architecture have turned to trash. When was the last time a great artist painted a great painting are a great sculptor made a great sculpture? When was the last time they built a building 1/2 is beautiful as the cathedral of Notre Dame? What was the last Broadway show that you saw that had half the talent of My Fair Lady? Even our automobiles are ugly and I used to take refuge in the beauty of a new car. Or even how beautiful an old Duesenberg was. And we need to remember items like that were only made in the last century. It’s not like they’re 500 years old.Who was the last artist who actually contributed anything of beauty to our world? And please don’t tell me Jackson Pollock.

                Hoagie – Doozy’s truly are a work of mechanical art.
Now &amp; then I enjoy listening to a symphony on You Tube where you can follow along with the score.  It’s incomprehensible to me how (for example) Stravinsky scored the Rite of Spring, or Rachmaninoff, Mozart, et al.  I suspect a very few composers of what currently passes for music could come within miles of them (unless, of course, aided by / plagiarized by AI).

            Yeah I’m not seeing the problem is looking to the past. It’s the domination of anti white etc worldview that tells you what to think of the past. If anything I would say the typical modern doesn’t know much about the past at all.

            This is a Millennial thing, most specifically a Millennial woman thing. It came out of the Tumblr “it’s ok to not be ok” navel-gazing. This is the first generation of people who had wide access to the internet and portable devices at an early age, and this is what we got out of it.
Obviously a lot of athletes at the Olympics are no longer Millennials (wow, time flies by fast) but the legacy lives on.

            They’ve been doing the sob-stories since at least the late 1990s. I remember the first half of the Super Bowl pregame show was always about “overcoming” this and that. Network TV in general has gotten more saccharine and banal. If it ever was not that.
TV is for drooling idiots now, so not surprising that the content is constant sentimental BS.

                The NFL Draft now has multiple “official” broadcasts, one on network TV where they trot out all these sob stories and the other on ESPN where they focus on the Xs and Os of the players getting drafted. Unsurprisingly, women eat up the sob stories and that’s who that stuff is geared towards.

                I don’t have any satellite or cable TV and I noticed how dumb TV really is. It’s nothing more than reality shows with diverse morons screaming profanities at each other over trivial matters and old movies we’ve seen thousands of time before. I tuned into the House Hunters show and my wife noted that all of the people on that program are assholes of the worst kind.
And then the commercials. Crazy how the switched flipped to every TV ad being either blackety-black-black all of the time or a black guy with a white wife. So insidious.

                        I don’t have the link right now, but I posted it on Instapundit. An Infiniti commercial with three mixed race couples sitting in an SUV. Of course, Nissan caters to the low credit score crowd, so that’s part of the explanation. Even if your credit sucks, you can trade up to a white woman if you buy this Infiniti.

                        The couple down the hall in my apartment building is a White guy with a black partner. She’s actually slender and fairly attractive though. I wonder if he realizes that by NOT picking a 500 lb sassy mammy he’s still just as racist as me since the girl looks like a White chick in blackface.
Of course I live in a place that’s basically a non-stop Leftist freakshow crossed with a south Asian slum. Just today, I saw a strung-out looking White dude with dreadlocks in his beard. The fun never ends here.

        It may be that the myths and legends of the past were not merely technological limitations to conveying history. Maybe a too-detailed understanding of facts gets in the way of the point of the stories.Imagine knowing everything about Antinous and Penelope prior to Odysseus returning. It might make understanding the story impossible; it might even make analyzing the story impossible, drowning as it would be in the particulars of every lived second of everyone’s life.How many normies have collected infinite facts about WWII – Easy Company, or Patton, or what Rommel did or did not do in some place, or how the Americans worked with the Resistance, or any of a million stories told on the History Channel – and yet cannot form an opinion about whether the war was just or unjust?

        At the dawn of the information age, it was assumed that everyone having the sum of human knowledge at their fingertips would unleash human potential in ways that had never been imagined.
It did. Unfortunately, it was the human potential for evil stupidity that got released.

                Exactly. One of the theories under IQ and HBD science is that we see a child’s IQ firming up in later life as he begins to shape his own intellectual environment, hence stability in IQ measurement across later years. We all live in a bubble of our making so to speak. That being said Jeff, your bubble was probably to surround yourself with the smarter segment of the populace. I certainly never was expose much to such people in such numbers until the internet came into common use.

        It’s another version of the “is/ought” problem, with the same solution. It’s most easily seen in religious language: “Because itisimpossible to avoid sin, yououghtnot to try.” But that’s not true: You are morally obligated to try, even though you know you will sometimes fail. Same thing here: “It has all been done before; therefore, I shouldn’t try to do anything.” The answer is the same: No, you are morally obligated to try, because that’s what life is. I’d ask the upcoming generation: Are you a man, or an amoeba? There’s an idea from the past that should be “rebooted” —agon, with its brother conceptarete.

        This is one of the more thought-provoking pieces Z has ever written.But there is another way of looking at history. Hence, instead of rupturing historical continuity in order to destroy an unpalatable present reality, history can be transmogrified in order to create a new reality favorable to those in power. And indeed, I think this is what has happened. The Left, beginning in the second half of the 60s, conquered the discursive field known as history and embarked upon a comprehensive revisionary project that, in Manichaean fashion, sacralized colored people, the insane and women, while condemning the Blue-eyed Ice Devil. As a result, Western civilization has been deligitimized, even in the eyes of perhaps most white people, and the justification for its destruction has been authored into the bargain. We are history’s villains, and those who are swamping, and in some cases murdering us, are its saints.It’s all a grand lie, of course. Quite possibly the grossest lie ever told. But until we recognize the lie, we will be hard pressed to resist the forces that are dismantling the greatest civilization ever created.

                I think the internet arrived after our destruction was already accomplished. “Old internet,” thecatalog of almost all human accomplishment (including all the latest stupidities and horrors)internet, now nearly erased, was the last gasp of the remnant.“Social media”-era internet was always a grave dance—a post-apocalypticpublic-private partnershipthat the people are invited to join, and all good citizens do.Remember, when we greybeards filled the tubes with the art, music, philosophy, literature, etc., of every great civilization, almost nobody downloaded it. Now almost everybodyopposesdownloading it. It’s a shift of emphasis, the attitudinizing of a fact, not a real change.

                Indeed. More important than the various media were the monomaniacal will of the New Left, and the crashing incredulity of what passed for the Right. As the Left mutated from Marxism to a more virulent postmodern fascism, the Right stood transfixed by the USSR. In consequence, a hellish viper was vexed to nightmare on the fruited plain.

            There’s room here for an extended essay on the writings of Jacques Ellul about Technology and how it shapes us as much if not more than we shape it. Also McLuhan, and Neal Stephenson’s Anathem (fanciful but inventive solution for these dilemmas).
Leaving Bernays and Friends out of the list as I don’t think we all grok (hi 3g4me) their ‘contributions’.
Can remember being introduced to the writings of Ellul as a know-it-all young engineering student and being totally dismissive. Wronggggg.

        The happiest I’ve ever been in the past couple of decades was when I went hunting in the Rockies with one of my sons for elk and went completely dark for a week. No TV. No internet. No X. No Gab. Nothing.Just beautiful silence. A bouquet of stars every night, hot coffee on a chilly morning. Just working on tracking the elk, exercising breath control for the perfect shot and executing.One of my friends calls the system mind rot and ignores it and encourages me to do the same. I think he might be on to something.Crazy how John Carpenter predicted the future with “They Live.” Who would’ve thought watching that film that it would become our reality?

That brings to mind the theme of another film, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The Regime can do people great harm one way or the other, but if you ignore it the power over you diminishes, even if it doesn’t go completely away as was the case with Freddie. Detaching from what your friend calls the “mind system” is at least part of the answer.

                My redoubt is in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of corn country.
When I first moved here, the silence was creepy; until I embraced it. Now, when the sun is coming up, and it rained the night before, one can hear the water perking into the soil. At first I thought I had a leak in a water hose.It has sharpened my senses immensely. The life that abounds, unbothered by the bullshit that we discuss here, is a cathartic respite from the insanity around me.

        I think the greater problem is not the presence of the past but more that past lessons are being ignored. The roles of the sexes, of corruption, of overbearing state power and of new age religions are all scourges familiar to students of history, as opposed to of narratives. We are busily redoing the worst mistakes of history instead of learning from them, fed by an abundance of resources, the constraints of which have traditionally put an end to such excursions into collective madness. Today the supply lines of resources are longer, allowing us to enter into levels of collective insanity that in previous ages reality would long ago have shut down. Hence when reality wakes up and puts on its boots the calamity will be worse than ever before

                Trying to wake up those still asleep is a waste of precious time now. As you advocate, people need to get their own family and dependents prepared to survive wild events. Micro, not macro, now.

        LPs brought us music so good it killed kids learning music from the family singing around the home piano. Now, every classical or popular music composition is almost free on the streaming services. TV was supposed to bring in an age of people watching science lectures and Shakespeare. The result under the internet is Kamala Harris speeches and porn. All that may bring the Taliban taking over and shutting everything down.

            “TV was supposed to bring in an age of people watching science lectures and Shakespeare.”
Does anyone expect—given our new “diversity”—a bunch of muds sitting around a TV watching the highest form of White expression/art/science?  Of course not.
However, there is an exception, East Asians. Yep.  China and Japan and Korea went from a history of using anancient Asian string instrument called the guqin, to fully staffed Western orchestras playing Mozart andBeethoven.  They adopted Western science, dress, and much culture as soon as they were exposed to it.  Why?  They were not mud people.

                The Blank Slate Theory is pernicious and perhaps the best example of paving the road with good intentions; we get to witness in real times its utter falsity. Boeing simply is the idea writ large of television as the great equalizer.

                Absolutely. You gotta give them credit. They are not a tremendously creative people, but they know a good thing when they see–or hear–it, are not too proud to replicate it, and sometimes may even be able to improve upon it. I’m thinking here of Japanese food culture. The Japs make what, in my opinion, may be the gest gins on the planet, very respectable beer, and whisky even the Scots must recognize. They’re also great devotees of fine western steak, and have made great contributions to the steak/steakhouse industry. Additionally, many connoiseurs of cutlery believe Japanese knives are the best in the world.

                    We used to be regaled at the university with demonstrations of “The Suzuki Method”—a popular approach to music education, particularly for teaching young children how to play the violin. It was developed by Japanese violinist and educator Dr. Shinichi Suzuki in the mid-20th century. The method is based on the idea that musical ability is not an inborn talent but can be developed in every child, much like language acquisition.  The President of the university loved these kind of shows put on for visiting dignitaries.These guys were serious in anything Western they took to heart.  In 1860, the Japanese bought a European ocean ship and hired a crew to teach themselves blue water navigation. By 1905, at The Battle of Tsushima, the Japanese Navy defeated the Russian Navy. This battle took place during the Russo-Japanese War and is considered one of the most significant naval engagements in history.  No other modern era nation had ever rose to such prominence from such a position of backwardness in so short a time period as Japan.  Too bad it took the form of warfare.

                        Afraid I can’t agree with Dr. Suzuki. I’d say musical ability, like its cousin intelligence, is highly heritable. And if you don’t inherit it, try as you may, you’ll never be able to play the Rack 3 or conduct the Philharmonic.

                        I had no idea of Japan’s yen–so to speak–for French cuisine, but I shouldn’t be surprised. I’ll say this–French food seems to be dying out in AINO. I dare say the number of high-quality French restaurants per capita in this country has never been lower. The competency crisis striking again? Preparing classical French cuisine is dashedly difficult, and perhaps beyond the ken of those who pass for chefs these days.
The fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine is interesting because seemingly so incongruous, but I really know very little about it.

        What a spectacular piece, Z. And – I think you hit the nail right on the head with that comment about creators seeking novelty in lunacy. Ditto the guys talking about how childhood trauma being the source of ‘origin stories’ and justification for that lunacy. The queer and trans communities are almost 100% founded on it. They all came from abusive  families. Whenever anything bad happens to them it’s never their fault – it’s the fault of people picking on them, enabled by a deeply flawed and evil society. The writers of our time. They are living out their own life stories where they are the brave heroes battling impossible odds and everyone else is a flat, one dimensional NPC’s or a mere prop. This is the foundation story for the vibrant race whores and jews too.I am hesitant to blame the computer and social media or the mainstream for it. One of the biggest mistakes I see with it (having learned the hard way) – is that we use them the wrong way. Like a bad carpenter – we blame our tools. We live in an age where we all must be censors – of ourselves. Wallowing on sites with defective people and trying to shield yourself from them is a waste of time. Our engagement with the cyberworld should focus almost exclusively on the things that empower us and make us happy. You don’t HAVE to listen to those people. Spend your time instead on people and creators that actually have the merit to warrant your time. We have to change our mindsets too – we think like defeatists This is why a faggot faced police chief in Britain thinks he can go on Twitter – now foolishly called X – and threaten Americans with extradition and imprisonment for poasts he doesn’t like. Say what ya want about Elon – he suspended the UK Gov’t account and shut that asshole right down without a second thought. Torba over at Blab banned the nation of Israel right off his platform. We must do the same on a much smaller level. Without an audience – these guys are nothing. We must change the way we perceive the culture war too. We have to develop a warrior ethos and view the adversity the culture wars bring as sporting events, with courage and lots of good humour.I was astonished the other day when I discovered a novel that just grabbed me from the first chapter. It’s called Castigo Cay written by Matt Bracken. I was astonished – I haven’t read a good fun fictional novel in 30 years! Like many, I was suffocated out of the fictional novel market by message fiction, agitprop and leftist degeneracy. It is so good to actually be able to read to relax as I used to do in the old world.No one is coming to save us. It’s all up to us… and we couldn’t be in better hands.

            I think we all have our traumas, I certainly have, I’ve known many ‘crazy’ people. What I say is, the trauma ceased to be real the moment it ended, you deal with the impression it left, and the habits of mind, which only seem real.Most people cope, and if they’re lucky the cope isn’t too self-destructive. Or maybe that’s a curse, because it becomes something you don’t have to deal with.I cope too, but every now and then I face the things. That’s scary, sometimes not very scary, sometimes so scary you forget it’s not real anymore. But I think it’s the only way. Even if you’re so screwed up you think you’re going to die, you have to accept it and be ready to die, have faith, go through the thing and be free of it.Turning fear into virtue is about the worst thing a person could do imo.OTOH, I have a psychologist friend who thinks I’m more or less dangerous giving such advice, but it works for me 😆

        This may explain the woke business. The reason people are creating these bizarre and logically impossible roles for themselves, things like transgenderism, for example, is as a way to escape the conformity of the present. On the one hand we live in a world where you are told to be an authentic individual, but the information age shows that every human character has already existed. The solution is to break free from reason itself in order to create new roles to play.Didn’t someone here previously point to the priests of Cybele cutting their junk off to please their goddess (or Juvenal satirizing girlboss-ish young Roman women noisily lifting weights in the gym) as examples of how absolutelynoneof this is new?“That which is has already been, And what is to be has already been; And God requires an account of what is past.”-Ecclesiastes 3:15

        Z, with regard to “new” ideas, innovations and the like.  It’s not so much that there aren’t new things, it’s just that new things don’t often happen at the speed of time preference.  Generations primed on and ever decreasing wait time now expect instant gratification.Sweat is icky, just take this fat burner and pose for pics next to the weights.Pain has been redefined to include the momentary discomfit, just take these pills and pose for pics.Somewhere in the piles of clay tablets is a script by a grey hair who was me in a previous life that is lamenting how the feminization and worship of self has ruined his favorite turn based tabletop game.Civilizations grow strong, thrive and then weaken and die.  And now I see, I live in the reason, why they should.

            This. Attention spans have decreased dramatically likely due to the bombardment of mass amounts of digital information, which seems chief among many reasons. People talk about things being memoryholed–the apparent State assassination attempt of Trump, for example–as if there has been coordinated effort to erase the event, but a reason perhaps as probable is the crowd moved on to the next shiny object before the next one that came after it and the hundreds that followed thereon. If something that significant and momentous cannot hold the public imagination due to the proliferation and volume of noise nothing can.Can the human mind withstand such an onslaught of constant information? Did anyone even bother to find out?

                Exactly.  The human brain was not built to process all the stimuli constantly bombarding it in the internet age.  The analogy I like is that you should treat information entering your brain like you would treat food entering your body.  Just as sitting at a limitless buffet of junk food would make us unhealthy, so does consuming a firehose of junk information.

                    Yes. Rather than an argument over who gets to bombard the brain with voluminous amounts of information, a humane and sane civilization would ask whether it should happen at all. We obviously do not live in that society. The AMA and APA are too busy claiming racism is a pandemic to take the time to understand the full effects of overloading the mind with junk info.

        Zman wrote, “On the one hand we live in a world where you are told to be an authentic individual, but the information age shows that every human character has already existed.”The ancients had this figured out 2,500 years ago.“What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done. Nothing is new under the sun!10Even the thing of which we say, “See, this is new!” has already existed in the ages that preceded us.”  Ecclesiastes 1:8-10 NABIt’s all futile and pointless.  He goes on to say that at the end of the day it’s all just vanity and vexation, but we all end up at the same point – death.  So just work hard, enjoy the fruits of your labor, and stop worrying about it.The reason the creepy weirdos seem so outraged is that, at the end of the day, there’s nothing particularly new or interesting about what they’re doing. And it drives them mad.As far as the arts go, I think we will see an even greater embrace of things made by hand.  Not less.  Yes, consumerism means you can go online and quickly buy a cheap trinket made by a machine.  It’s been that way for awhile now.  But I also see businesses (Etsy is an example, sort of) started by makers.  There’s a permanence to things made by hand that no machine can attain.

See, it’s not the murder of indigenous Brits by foreigners that angers people.  It’s the “disinformation” about those crimes that riles them up, you silly goose!  Now go turn yourself in to the local constabulary for having unapproved thoughts.

        Lamenting macro-issues, such as today’s post, is a purely intellectual exercise that offers unique insight accompanied by the illusion of improved understanding and an advance toward remedy. But we’re not going to “think” our way out of the mess we’re in either. It’s going to have to get tangible and ugly soon, and a strong back will serve you better than a bright idea when that happens. The parasites aren’t going to off themselves.

        This is the case for a lot of people. But not for those who are actually using the internet as a tool of self-empowerment. It is through the internet that I found a mitochondrial fission/fusion protocol using supplements you can buy on line that actually works. Same for a stem cell and senolytic protocol. It is the internet that allows me to follow progress in development of partial epigenetic cellular reprogramming that I will no doubt be using by the end of this decade. People who use the internet for technical and self-empowerment purposes derive the intended benefits from the information revolution. It is all the people who use it for political purposes but who are in reality smearing their Id all over the internet who are now suffering the consequences of such.

            Wait, you are going to tell us you found “fountain of youth” supplements and not put the links in? Either you are not on the payroll (and don’t get kickbacks) or you are selfish and do not want to share your eternal life secrets! 😁For the record, I’m highly skeptical of any supplement being able to directly affect any of those mechanisms as anything absorbed through the gut simply doesn’t work that way but am direly curious about what you found. (I’m a classically trained biochemist/genetic engineer but hated the glacial pace of lab work, just for the record)Now those mRNA shots they tested on us as a worldwide lab rat population? Those -do- work and can directly affect mitochondria profoundly. If only they had used it to lengthen our lives instead of trying to shorten them. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        Discerning people can still discern. It just turns out there were never really all that many of them, relatively speaking, and still aren’t. Probably fewer all the time, given demographic trends.Nowadays, rather than “suffer” from their menial stupid jobs, or in addition to suffering from their menial stupid jobs, the great masses suffer from tik tok brain. I don’t know if this is any more or less eugenic than having them plow a field all day or replace bobbins at the textile plant. Either way, they are not good for much more than life at subsistence level. Their lack of original thought is hardly a new development.Art, cinema, and music were all in decline already (especially art) before and as the internet became ubiquitous. Thus I do not see the internet as causative. The decline in the arts is just a marker of a declining culture, for which the internet was not required.

        The difference being, who is steering the ship.We were hypnotized by the civic religion of Civil Rights.Malevoent action parasitizes our greatest weapons, most especially our knowledge bases. It depends on what is highlighted.Christianity could be a warrior religion, were key passages highlighted.Colonization uplifted the world, because of who was doing it. Colonization today is destroying the world, because of who is doing it.

        A couple generations into it and this has clearly not been the case. Creative output, for example, has grounded to a halt.Agree, and disagree.Creative output from thetraditional sourceshas ground to a halt, yes. Hollywood and mainstream network TV or streaming services, record labels, big AAA video game studios, and art institutions are all allergic to creativity and ingenuity in this day. Reboots, remakes, prequels, spin-offs, the same thing as last time with a different colored paint, focus group tested stories and plots, the four chords of pop music and autotune, and a mirror painted red sold for $1,100,000 are all endemic to legacy media.However, there is an endless collection of creativity out there and in large part thanks to the internet;everyone having the sum of human knowledge at their fingertips unleashing human potential in ways that had never been imagined, you might say. 3D printing, 3D and 2D modeling and animation, developer tools for video games, editor software for movies, mixing software for music, tutorials, how-to guides, channels and blogs dedicated to teaching people anything from cooking, to programming, maintenance of your car, brewing your own beer, how to get your great American novel published, and how to build a 1/4 scale Sherman tank for your son to tear around the backyard in.The difference, I think, is that the traditional media feels so inescapable is because it is: A) The default state of things, though this is waning.B) What is pushed on everyone by you know who.C) Has institutional backing for promotion, distribution, and financing.D) Is easy to find.And I think the ease of discovery is the hardest part. Legacy, stagnant, trash media is here, there, everywhere, and pushed on everyone; even on the internet. The new creativity is out there but youhave to look for it.And for the average that is a lot of work. It is easier to get streaming subscriptions and have the slop tapped to your home so you can consume product and get excited for next product. There are tons of utter trash on the internet that are just as mindless and devoid of soul. But there is a powerful undercurrent of passion and creativity out there made possible because people can talk to each other and share information through the internet. There are creative people out there today, making whatever they are passionate about, who never would have done so if not for the internet. Just as it is easy to access legacy media, it is easy to despair about it, and easy to declare the great promise of the internet to have failed. There is greatness out there on the World Wide Web, but you have to look for it!Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

        The one good thing about the internet is it has brought with it the concept of “internet time.” IT manifests itself as a almost universal modern day perception that everything must happen immediately and the sell-by date of everything is reduced to essentially zero. Wokism is already on the way to being “old and busted,” and the Alphabet People must nervously look over their shoulders for who will supplant them as the celebrated flavor of the moment.Just as nobody bothers to be Rembrandt or Michelangelo anymore, the great unwashed will eventually find the firehose of the past to be a hose they no longer can be bothered to drink from.

        The first thing this makes me think of is the printing press, and Protestant literacy. Reading Scripture, especially the Hebrew Scripture. Identifying with the Jews, eventually. Here we are again, at something like the BC/AD boundary, another End— at least we think so. Seems to me, anyway. Talk about being haunted!
Don’t forget the AD part, don’t sweat it.

        I don’t know if I would call today’s creative works technically superior. Everything is too perfect, too steady, everybody uses the same camera movements and editing cuts. It’s actually pretty boring. There’s a certain amount of artistic appeal to a fast zoom on film with the older equipment that wasn’t as refined as it is today. There’s also the issue of the film stock they use. Like music on digitized master tapes, there’s nothing more appealing to me than older film stock that has been digitized. It just looks good to the eyes.You can see the same thing with signage in the old days. Hand-painted signs were actually pretty interesting to look at. The new signs with laser cut lettering or just too perfect. Likewise, advertising. Look at an old supermarket or magazine ad from maybe the 1970s. The type setting was even fun to look at. It was an art form. Now, it looks like something anybody can do on their Apple computer.

        “The democratization of information would not only raise all of humanity but unleash the potential of people…”Nothing wrong with today’s musing—except it misses the point or essence of the problem.Those of us involved in the HBD community understand the essence of the problem—or at least have a theory to explain such. The reason we’ve not unleashed the potential of the people is that there is *no* potential to unleash! (None of this is to degrade the usefulness of the general populace. They have *their* purpose.)Leaving aside the phenomenon that we are becoming more stupid and corrupt as a people due to the mutational load we are carrying, the basic problem is that most people do little more for society than exist. They do not create, they do not advance civilization. They simply exist and use what *others* create.Dutton discusses this and lays the theory out in his book, “The Genius Famine”. It is the extremes of the IQ distribution that make the advances and support such development. This observation follows on to another theory—The Smart Fraction. Those are the people who make use of discoveries and implement them in any advanced society. That number is not entirely known/set, but is predicted to be shrinking. Hence all the problems described by Z-man are known and predictable.In summary, you can lock a bunch of Monkeys in a Radio Shack, but they won’t build a radio.

        “On the one hand we live in a world where you are told to be an authentic individual”The tragedy here is that they actually can’t see their own uniqueness through all the tattoos, piercings, hair dyes and other ways they want to decorate the book cover. There are types but every single one of us is unique. I have worked with animals for years and it has amazed me that even though they’re different personality types say within cats each one in the type is still unique.  I  look around the world and am awed at the sheer number of unique personalities, it’s astounding, and I’m pretty sure that roaches and mosquitoes have them too we just can’t see them. We truly are unique, each one of us.

        There is no new “information age”, or at least not one’s that’s radically different from the pre-internet age. High quality information is as hard to obtain as it has always been, at least since the invention of the printing press. What the internet has made possible is low-level rubbish (e.g. social media posts and pictures) whizzing about at the speed of light. Worthwhile information is cordoned off and is either not accessible or you have to pay for it.Let’s delve into this in more detail. There’s a hierarchy of raw data at the base, then information one level higher (i.e. raw data sifted and organized to the extent that statements can be made about it), then knowledge, then understanding, then wisdom. (I’ve lifted this hierarchy shamelessly from “The Oxford Guide to Library Research.”) Even raw data is not readily available on the next. And the higher you go in the hierarchy, the more closely is it guarded and cordoned off, and either inaccessible or expensive.Even if the raw data is available, humans have to work on it to make it information or something higher. ChatGPT won’t do the trick. Once data has been transformed into “value-added product”, it’s going to be yet harder to obtain.My experience has been that what is freely available on the net is garbage. For learning mathematics, Khan Academy on YouTube is garbage. What is not garbage is good texts and a competent and insightful instructor — but these cost. Or to give another example, a chess database like ChessBase can be bought for a couple of hundred dollars — but this has only the raw data of millions of games played the last few centuries plus some rudimentary features that provide some information on typical plans and maneuvers. If you want higher level information and insight, you have to pay for it.If I want a journal article, it’s cordoned off on the net and I have to pay a hefty sum for it. If there’s an article in the Financial Times, again I have t pay for it. And this makes sense as high-level knowledge and understanding costs money to produce and disseminate.What’s free is generally coming either with the detritus of advertising or with your personal data being sold to corporations or Big Brother snooping on you.In brief, all this Al Gore talk three decades ago about the “information superhighway” was so much bull. All the dolts saying “there’s so much information available on the internet” are utterly clueless.

Sure, but that’s the capitalist system.  Who’s gonna do the work without some renumeration?  ChatGPT is gonna be a “charged for” service eventually.  There can be no such thing as “information must be free” if you expect someone else to do the access and sorting for you.  Better the information is available—at a price—than not.

                Yes, and that’s what I’m saying in my fifth paragraph. I’m really taking issue with Al Gore’s BS “information superhighway,” with the implicit that there was going to be “lots of information for free, free, free! A stance with which quite a few dolts apparently still subscribe to. Whereas economists rightly teach us that there ain’t no free lunch.
I’m not complaining about the cost of information either — it costs to produce it. Though I do take issue with the monopoly pricing power of publishers and tech giants

        &gt;We now live in a world where it is plain to see that every creative thing one can imagine has been done and most likely done better than anything that could be done today.It is not a matter of a lack of will to greatness, it is far worse.  The problem lies in both conception and execution.If artists were merely executing competent recapitulations of past achievements, this would be one thing.  And not such bad of a thing, either.But CultureBerg — as described by Tom Wolfe in the Painted Word — fears and hates achievements it cannot claim as its own, achievements that are immune to theory.  And Theory is the means by which culture is circumsized.Now our artists, writers, musicians lack even minimal competence.  Most lack even the basic qualities required for competence, discipline and the ability to concentrate.But even an artist who has the will and the means is left alone to overcome the screens.Screens have destroyed boredom and have crowded out the imagination.  It is not that everything has been done before.  It is that the constant screening in and out of what has been done and redone has narrowed the range of vision of whatcould bedone while reinforcing the norms of the regime: conformity and medicority.  This is the cultural side of entshitiffication.  There are no happy accidents because there are no accidents at all.It’s worth noting that the failure of the future promised by modernity haunts the present.  This has also put the kibosh on the creative impulse.Mark Fisher spent a lot of time on this problem.  He concluded this was all a function of late-stage post-industrial capitalism.  He could find no way around it or through it.  A few years later, he hanged himself.Capitalist Realism — Is There No Alternative? : Mark Fisher : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive

            I see the essence of the problem as two fold:  1) Lot’s of low lying fruit has been picked. Hence we see a lot of “same old, same old”.  Novel ideas come along increasing rarely.  Nothing unpredictable.  2) There’s an insatiable need for more and more media to fill the competitive demands of the internet.  Entrepreneurs are battlingfearlesslyfor eyeballs.  Hence repeats of old ideas and story lines.There was a time when the main media of the day, TV, had three channels.  They could afford to turn down many novel ideas.  Today, I can name dozens of content providers across all applications of the internet.   We’ve outstripped supply.

                The low-hanging fruit theory is certainly applicable to science, and perhaps even philosophy. But the arts? I’m not so sure. The Fifth Symphony, Vitruvian Man, and “The Masque of the Red Death” were not sitting there in the ether waiting to be plucked by Beethoven, Leonardo and Poe. They were created. Had those three geniuses never existed, neither would their extraordinary works. Hence, the dearth of artistic genius in postmodernity is due not to an absence of pomegranates within easy reach; it is a function of cognitive decline. Or perhaps our abandonment by God.

                    It’s a matter of numbers needed and what of quality can be provided.Let’s take movies. Most, not all, movies bore (or worse insult) me. Why? The plot line is—to me anyway—hackneyed, the acting often bad, the plot fantastical, with waay too much dependence on fast GGI to hold audience attention. I’m old, I’ve seen my share. Nothing new under the sun as they say.I was at the theater, first in line, to see the 1978 movie “Superman,” starring Christopher Reeve. They made at least 5 of these. One worse than the other. Never saw another one, but the first one was fine and of interest because I was a comic book kid of the 50’s.Same with the current barrage of action hero cartoon movies. You know—childish cartoons for adults and DIE halfwits. Creativity and therefore novelty is in too short a supply, even if one assumes the human imagination is *limitless*.And yet, years later, out pop’s “Deadpool”. Perhaps the only film in the genre worth seeing (for adults). Clever and witty dialog and a self deprecating spoof of the genre. But that’s one of perhaps dozens of non-creative attempts in that genre after the first few entries’ novelty wore off.The American movie theater releases 500-700 films per year to the theaters. If we toss in streaming movies—the stuff funded by media moguls like Netflix—we have perhaps 1000 movies per year to amuse ourselves. You mean there are 1000 new plots and twists and ways of telling (in essence) the same story? Not a chance.In short, human nature moves pretty slowly. Now I don’t say that these movies are not profitable, only that they bore *me*. YMMV.

                        All you say may be true, and probably is. However, the phenomenon you describe can be explained more plausibly as a function of cognitive decline than as a depletion of artistic possibilities, which, at any rate, are inexhaustible.

        Yes, the age of information became the age of mass malformed information but the internet was a bonanza for those few who would go on to sharpen their understandings among other men who were searching outside the lines of orthodoxy containing all ideologies. It doesn’t matter that this is one percent of the population, it matters only that meaningful discussion has greatly advanced from thirty years ago, and that has advanced understanding in those people who read them.

        One of the most difficult things to accept about the present situation is how stupid the people that make up the ruling class and their functionaries are. I had always assumed that self preservation and will to power etc. would place certain limits on how far they would push incompetents up into positions of autonomous authority; that certain institutions crucial to maintaining societal vigor would be protected from corruption by necessity but it isn’t true. It could very well be that the original intent included those kinds of limits but it appears that once you let the imbecile’s nose under the tent they completely take over and result in the realization of idiocracy. All of it brings to mind the self-destruction solution to the Fermi Paradox.

        Yes, but.I call the last 500 years the Age of Gutenberg where only intellectuals got to publish. But now with the Age of the Internet everyone gets to publish.

            Narrative and authority don’t have the oomph they used to have. No doubt there’s good and bad to that, but for now, idk, maybe it’s necessary?
I’m sure they’ll make a comeback, strong as ever, once the rot is cleared. Amazing it’s been 500 years or so, this ‘revolution’. Started with a bang, though.
The scope of things! I wish I could live longer, just to take in one age.

            Ah yes, Gutenberg. The internet has enabled me to have the entire six volumes of Gibbons’ Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the entire works of Mark Twain, and many obscure books from the late nineteenth century all on my Kindle via the Gutenberg Project. They cost me nothing and it took mere seconds to download. Haven’t been in a library in years.

        Not only was the promise of the internet never really realized, the cost has ballooned out of control.  Every year it seems to increase or introduce new costs.  Despite the total inability to keep anything secure, more and more information and control are put on it for little benefit.

                    They are already doing it.  Amazon is “updating” ebooks you bought and paid for.  Sony allowed you to “buy” movies and after they no longer had favorable terms with the movie’s owners, you could no longer play the movie.Whenever I have an ebook I like and want to keep for reference, I find a paper copy.As for the newspapers, it really doesn’t make a difference.  Look at Charlottesville.  All of the favorable coverage by people who were there are long gone and the only record that exists are copies of the newspaper or microfilm of them. ALL LIES.  Just like the peaceful non-violent “civil rights” movement.  That they were entirely passive and non-violent while the mean old racists were extremely violent is the only record that exists.Does anyone really believe the 2014 press or 2024 press or 2020 press is corrupt because they lost their way?  That they used to be honest, but that now they just aren’t holding the journalistic ideal?  That they only now describe, arson, looting, beating and murder as “mostly peaceful,” whereas before they used to be honest?I got a bridge to sell you, very cheap and with easy financing.

        There’s a natural human hierarchy within groups as well as between them.  Some people will have questing minds, but most will limit their mental energy to their own narrow needs and little else.  It would be strange if the proles suddenly sought to imorove rather than just consume/enjoy.It’s a bad thing that the people in charge allow the entertainments to be pure lies and wickedness, because so many people have weak mental defenses against this.  But, as we know, the ruling class is evil, so we can only expect this to get worse.I wonder if a new form of natural selection is at work in this…

        This post is a lengthy, and much better reasoned take on a situation I have conceptualized as, “information diarrhea.”
Most people don’t have the finely tuned powers of discernment and the ability to disengage from the endless torrent of information available.
Heck, this is something I find myself struggling with.

                To-day we live so cowed under the bombardment of this intellectual artillery that hardly anyone can attain to the inward detachment that is required for a clear view of the monstrous drama. The will-to-power operating under a pure democratic disguise has finished off its masterpiece so well that the object’s sense of freedom is actually flattered by the most thorough-going enslavement that has ever existed.

        This is a weird topic to discuss today since I’ve had anxiety for a week or so. Its one of those things that, like clockwork, can happen every eighteen months and sometimes every few years, then it evaporates as if it never existed.
I will say that all the BS happening in the world right now can be normally very bothersome. But when your going through an anxiety episode, it seems irrelevant.
But I will say that when this current age ends, we will doubtless have learned some lessons that will hopefully bring in a new enlightenment

        There are more artists, of higher skill, living today than there ever were in the past. Look at Art Renewal Center’s Salon competition entries to see. The issue is that high-quality art is drowned in a sea of slop, now mostly automated. Curation is the main issue, not gross amount.
