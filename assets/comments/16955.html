        Z, greetings from the party that we commenters are having in your uninhabited house.  It’s really raging.  I wonder if we can get this place cleaned up before you return.  Frip is as wild as you might have guessed.  Calsdad is lecturing us about the free rider problem regarding our prodigious supply of alcohol.  Derb is singing loudly in Chinese on the patio out back.  I hope your neighbors can someday forgive you for this.
Are you paid up on your homeowner’s insurance?

        There definitely is an awakening happening in Finland, and I’m not talking about the secret handshake society meeting where you are probably going.The parliamentary elections are next week, and there is a general atmosphere of great dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment. Plenty of normies are starting to feel that the old parties are completely out of touch with the common people.It’s not just the immigration, though that is a big part of it. All the old parties and the mainstream media are raving about the climate change and how Finland has to save the world. Regardless of what you think about the climate change itself, the solutions that the main stream politicians are proposing are downright insane, like banning selling new combustion engine cars during the next ten years, as if viable alternatives to them existed. Normal people are simply gasping when they listen to this stuff. This is how the yellow vest thing got started in France. It’s as if the main stream parties are trying to shoot themselves in the foot.The ”populist” Finns party is rising fast in the polls and might even have a chance of becoming the largest party in the Parliament, something that would have sounded completely absurd just six months ago. They have run a very effective campaign, and there are definitely lessons to be learned here for nationalist in other countries too. If Z-man has time in Turku, I would recommend visiting the ”elecion street” in the centre and talk with people there to get the feeling of what’s going on. I’m not in Turku myself now, but from the pictures I’ve seen it seems like people are mostly interested in talking with the candidates of the Finns party, while the candidates of other parties are mostly standing alone there.

                “That’s encouraging, but the Finns are going to learn what we did in the US: We aren’t voting our way out of this.”Well, when it comes to the population replacement, Finland might very well be one of the countries that can stop it by voting. It was only 30 years ago when the population was still basically 99 % Finns. Third World immigration only began in the early 90s, and was slow at first, so Finland is several decades behind other Western European countries in this regard. We are definitely starting to see the negative effects of this idiotic policy, but Third World immigrants still make up only a relatively small share of the population compared to other Western European countries. We are lucky that we can see what a horror show mass immigration has been in other countries, especially in neighboring Sweden, and wake up before it’s too late.Many other Western countries, including USA and Sweden, are probably too far gone to be saved by democratic means, but I think this should be seen as an opportunity. Never let a good crisis go waste as they say. Let’s face it, 10–20 % of white people are probably genetically predisposed to adopt self destructive far left ideologies (((and no, it doesn’t matter whether those ideologies were originally invented by the joos or not))). Yesterday it was Communism, today it’s Multiculturalism, and God only knows what they will come up with tomorrow.I don’t see any other means of preventing this kind of madness from happening again but to split Western countries into smaller autonomous political units and isolating the baizuos to their own areas where they cannot have any influence on political decision making in the areas where normal white people live. To put it bluntly, I’m not interested in saving the white race, I’m interested in purging the white race. Even if this kind of balkanization wasn’t necessary in Finland to stop mass immigration, I’m still very much in favour of it even here.

                    Multiculturalism, open borders, global warming, gender neutral “people,” etc., are just different terms or manifestations of communism.
No different than Bernie Sanders, your typical NYC / Brooklyn communist  POS , now calling himself a democratic socialist.
All of these religious ideologies promote the dissolution of the family and of  nation states, of traditional social mores, and imposition of restrictions and prohibitions on what can be said, shown, heard, and seen.
The promoters and adherents of these ideologies are STALINISTS, no matter what terminology they use to obscure this fact.

                    The use of the Chinese word baizuo for crazed self hating progs is a good idea. No love for the Chinese but we need a short pithy word for those types. We gave our manufacturing away, at least we can steal a word back.

                Europe might well be able to vote its way out, other than maybe Germany or France. Even the UK might manage it . Europe is mostly White unlike the US and has a string ethnic and cultural  identityThe US however isn’t going to able to do this, its a gumbo of different groups and even similar ethnic groups disagree on far too many thingsThat said,  the Dissident Right suffers from a distinct live and let live ethos which is stupid.If you have power you can stop degeneracy in its tracks and I promise you the next time someone is a degenerate and  they are hanged with 3 days , that crap will mostly stop at least in publicIf you are a rich urban nation, you have to drop the hammer on immortality if you  don’t want it to  turn into Wiemar GermanyThe US used to do this with divorce and sodomy laws and obscenity lawsAn example of this happening now  is Iran. I don’t agree with the way the Iranians do things but by an large the guys that took over the knew this, Persia defaults to cosmopolitan and decently well off , the traits lead to decadence so therefore you punish decadence harshlyIran is still a mass from some brain dead decisions but  reform as we’d see it is still far on the horizonThe Dissident Right will obviously take a rather different path but instead of fearing power they should relish they day they can slap someone in jail for promoting cultural Marxism to someone under 21Loving power   isn’t a traditional American value  but traditional; America  requires a homogeneous moral population . Until we have that learn to love the boot so long as you are wearing it and doing the stomping.

                    Live and let live has gotten us the grotesque levels of degeneracy we have in society today. Stuff that was rated ‘X’  40 years ago is now common on TV and movies – take the SAW series for example.  That’s how far the Overton window has moved.No one today outside some hard line Christian groups and Muslims will even condemn Homosexual marriage and trannies. It’s just as acceptable among DR as it is among the Hollywood set.You don’t even see HBD doyens like Sailer condemning nasty old men sharing a bathroom with little girls just shows you how pervasive it is.40-50 years ago in this country perverts who came out the closet were either killed or beaten unless they lived in a shit hole like NYC or Jersey. Child rapists tended to vanish if caught. Today we hold candlelight vigils and nod solemnly.Lastly the DR will never have power. Not that it could achieve power – it could if was truly serious and ruthless as the ruling class.  It’s just  more of a intellectual club of sorts.

                Uh, that’s a long story. I’ll try to give the short version.The party was founded back in the 90s by a chap called Timo Soini, who was the leader of the party until 2017. Soini is your run of the mill opportunistic populist who will say anything to get elected and betrays his supporters immediately after he gets any real power.Under Soini the Finns party was a sort of general purpose protest party that anyone could vote who was fed up with the bland main stream parties that you could hardly tell apart. Immigration critics also joined the party and tried to use it as a means to change immigration policy, but the party was not solely focused on immigration, and Soini never really cared about the whole issue. He just used it to increase the support of the party. Instead, Soini branded himself as a Nigel Farage style EU critic.The party achieved great success in parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2015, which thoroughly shocked the establishment. Soini, however, didn’t really use this success to achieve anything, except getting himself appointed as the foreign minister in 2015. After the elections of 2011 the party had stayed in opposition, but after the 2015 elections it formed a government with two center right cuckservative parties (yeah, we have two of them). Shortly after this the migration crisis hit Europe and thousands of asylum seekers started pouring to Finland from Sweden. Soini could have demanded the other two parties to close the border, but he didn’t want to risk breaking the government and losing comfy job as a minister, and did nothing. After this support of the party collapsed.In 2017 party convention members of the party who were fed up with Soini elected Jussi Halla-aho as the new party chairman. Halla-aho was the leader of the anti-immigration faction inside the party and he had always had an uneasy relationship with Soini. After the party convention Soini, who was again trying to save his job as a minister, defected from the party with his supporters and formed a new party called Blue Reform, which replaced the Finns party in the government. Soini and his friends kept their jobs as ministers, but they lost almost all their supporters among voters. The situation was a complete farce. There was a party in the government that had five ministers, but had around 1 % support in the opinion polls.During the last two years Halla-aho has been repairing the damage caused by the split and during this time he has turned the party from a protest party with a vague message to a nationalist party with a crystal clear message of always putting the interests of the Finnish people first. He is now reaping the rewards of this work as the support of the party is soaring again. And unlike Soini, Halla-aho will use that support to get shit done.

                    Thanks, that was interesting. I’ve been following Swan of Tuonela, but she stopped making videos shortly after the party split and her (Algerian) boyfriend entered politics.I asked, because I’m extremely paranoid about sellouts and managed opposition.Shortly after this the migration crisis hit Europe and thousands of asylum seekers started pouring to Finland from Sweden. Soini could have demanded the other two parties to close the border, but he didn’t want to risk breaking the government and losing comfy job as a minister, and did nothing.This mirrors almost exactly what happened with the Danish People’s Party: shortly before hordes of welfare jihadis started pouring in from Germany, they had a landslide election and ended up the largest party in the winning coalition, which traditionally would allow them to appoint the PM.The other three parties in the blue block had run on hardline immigration rhetoric in an attempt to capture the anti-immigration vote, so this was the moment of truth for the DPP: they had the power to close the border.Instead they allowed thousands of Mohammadans to illegally cross the border and freely wander around on our motorways which were being closed off for taxpaying commuters, toallow the police to play pattycake with the cute, jihadi children.If the DPP were a real party, they’d have gone to the PM and told him to seal the borders or face a vote of no confidence, followed by a migration-themed election. They would have captured close to 50% of the vote.Now, Danes are deserting the DPP, but luckily, a new hardliner party has been established to challenge the DPP from the right, to corral all those dissatisfied voters. The spokesgal is a Jaguar-driving, PR-trained, bottle-blonde, AR-lite camgirl, and her party financed by a millionaire banker living in Switzerland for tax reasons. I’m sure they’ll not stab us in the back, 15-20 years down the road, when we’ve voted them within striking range of power.The DPP is fake news, the Norwegian Progress Party is fake news, Farage was fake news and so is Trump.You’re an idiot if you vote, you’re just drawing out the inevitable legitimacy breakdown.

                    Loss of social status IS death for them. Hence, they will kill to maintain it. I have said before and elsewhere that if our masters had to resort to dropping nukes on their own countries in order to survive politically, they will not hesitate.

                        Fair point though I don’t fear nukes, no one has done this since they won’t survive doing it and the people who control them aren’t the people who want to use them.The ultra rich may also find large sections of the military and police who come from groups they despise  unresponsive to orders as well. Fig of war old chapAnyway these days we can’t even find sober and honest people to sit in the nuclear silos anymoreBesides  the US may well not be a nuclear power in a few years. We use tritium for our nuclear triggers, are running out of the stuff which has a short half life and have failed every single time we’ve tried to make more.

They and many of their family members would most certainly come to the blog the read a American’s impression of their town.

        The contradiction I keep running into is the exposure problem. When we are nice and separate, whites start getting weird ideas about the hordes over the horizon. It’s only when we see The Other that we realize how similar we really are and that we are on a team. Racism isn’t a prejudice, its a postjudice. Even if we were to prevail, what’s stopping our descendants from regressing?
The yo-yo of history is disturbing.

            When people get rich all they have left to give them that dopamine rush is social signalling and in group posturing.Our rulers being uniformly  rich have nothing better to do that than to virtue signal to each other and as loving refugees and migrants is virtuous, we get a lot of thatThis would suggest that if the Left could be convinced getting rid of refugees was high status, they’d be all in but class prejudice , this being something lower classes want, makes this hardThere is also a faction of the establishment  who cannot have more expensive labor no matter what the actual social cost of this, Silicon Valley to some degree and  Big Ag in its entiretyKettling them will run into the great wall of money problemThis suggests that either the economy will have to go Venezuela and the rich won’t be rich and/or enough people will be pissed off enough to simply decide all out war is better and they and all their institutions, friends and supporters will be eliminated from power . We are closer day by day to the later but it won’t happen to a certain time after President Trump,I’m praying for another way of course but it doesn’t look good.Now as to your question about stopping a regression nothing. Ancient Rome had the same problem and it helped kill them. Anytime a group is wealthy , detached from the mainline of society and usually urban, its a riskIf the Dissident Right takes power and uses it well  they’ll have to create a path for social power and virtue that fits its values. Since they will have   gained much power , they’ll have a grand opening to set the rules and brother do people love a winnerThat said at current rates  in less time than from now to the Founding of the Nation the  US will probably undergo a catabolic collapse to a much lower tech baseIts quite possible  biggest group will be Amish and similar typesThey are huge virtue signalers all but its expensive and earned virtue and requires work. This is a good thing. Unearned virtue is an issue, no earned , socially conservative virtueAfter the fall I suspect this will be the default, I am virtuous because I have many kids and much land and my community has electricity and running waterFuture US will probably resemble 1900 more than THE FUTURE

        Of course, alcohol loosens the tongue by removing inhibition, which is dangerous with the Finns.
So Jukki meets his old friend Pekka from school, and suggests they grab a drink. They get a hand of some bottles, sit down and start drinking. They work their way through the first bottle of vodka and start out on the next.
Halfway though the second bottle, Jukki says “So, how are you doing?

        In many way, Europe today is like an old Russian fishing trawler. Every day, the Captain goes down to check on things below. It’s hot, it smells bad and there’s oily water sloshing around. The crew smiles, tips their hats in respect and points to the leaks and complains about parts they need to keep things running properly. The Captain says nothing. He smiles, returns the nod and goes back up to the wheel house.Then one day, as he descends to inspect the engine room, he notices the water is halfway up the ladder. Yet he is somehow in complete surprise and oblivious to the fact the crew has been telling him about the problems over and over every day.So he closes the hatch and returns to the wheel house. But now he notices the ship isn’t as fast or the rudder as responsive as he remembered it being the day before.And then he sees the iceberg.

        I know the travelogue stuff is supposed to be “light” but it’s providing some pretty big insights. I think the benefit of going somewhere like Russia and not just exploring the “postcard” core is that it helps counter the hysterical/interventionist neocon-neoliberal baloney about how we’re always five minutes away from being conquered by some country (usually Russia or China). Realizing a place has its own severe internal problems, and seeing those problems firsthand, is a good countering tonic to the fear-mongering we get daily here. And then there’s the fact that, contra the stereotype, most foreigners like Americans but hate American foreign policy, which is something most of us have in common with them. America has the same problem with immigration as most Western nations, but also the crazy foreign policy baggage and Israeli ball-and-chain that needs to be severed. Being a soldier stationed in Germany during Dubya’s reign I got looks from the locals like I was a registered sex offender most of the time.

                Americans were an occupying/conquering force in Germany in the Marshall Plan/Postwar years, and there was some justification for our presence through the Cold War (and the guys who were stationed there during that time had a hell of a lot of fun). By the early aughts, though,we were squatters, which doesn’t really get Western European women hot and bothered, unless you’re a Muslim loafer who might force them into wearing a hijab (being forced to wear more clothes is the postmodern Western female’s equivalent of bodice-ripper fantasies for previous generations of women).

                        Man I think you’re on to something there.I was really disturbed by some of the reaction to the New Zealand mosque shooting.  It seems from browsing Twitter that Kiwis came up with a ScarvesInSolidarity where New Zealand women fell all over themselves to don headscarves. The lady PM of NZ was photographed multiple times wearing a headscarf.If a white Christian man had opined that women should wear headscarves these same women would get the vapors and shout about sexism and oppression and body and slut shaming until they were hoarse.  Yet they fall all over themselves to meet Muslim standards of modesty.Not to sound like a Roissy knock off but I can’t help but think women are waiting for men to reestablish the patriarchy they’re always crying about smashing.

Political correctness is itself a racist ideology. Hating on white people gives the modern social justice warrior that sense of power that little people crave.

It’s the opining that’s the problem. You need to order them.

Nah, it’s perfectly normal. I felt relief each time I was crossing the border of this country. And I’ve been vor and grew up there. Tension is just part of everyday life. I didn’t realize the scale of it until I immigrated.

        “They drink like Japanese businessmen”. One thing about this is that about the only time a Japanese businessman is free to speak his mind is when he is drunk. Everyone excuses what people say when someone is drunk, so a lot of guys will get whomever they want to say something frank to into a bar, have a couple of drinks, and pretend to be drunk whether they are or not, just to get the thing off their chest or to make the request they want to make or demand a raise. They use drinking the way other cultures use golf.

            Yeah, if you’re an alcoholic, Japan or East Europe are bad, bad…..BAD places to visit. I was in the infantry in the ‘70s and ‘80s, I’m no stranger to hard drinking. But these cats, they can’t hold their liquor and they drink hard. It’s getting a tad better in Japan; the kids are slowly wiping up. The old style salaryman was expected to work himself to death during the day and drink himself into a stupor at night. But it’s sad, really is. There’s quite a few young men who’ve lost their fathers to that void. Were you a teacher in Tokyo? JET and English teachers get a nasty rap for the “soft” job, but I’ve met a few that had the 1000 yard stare after their contract was up.

        Speaking of Newark, I’m reminded of the first time I had to change NJT trains there outbound from Manhattan. I didn’t realize my connection would simply be across the platform — wouldn’t those trains be running in the other direction? — so I descended into the main station, which was completely empty and quiet and looked like it had suffered a zombie apocalypse fifteen years earlier except for the fact that one of the electronic displays was still working. Not a soul around to ask where I should go. Maybe I was supposed to head over to that other set of tracks down at the street level? It was only about fifty feet away, surely nothing bad would happen if I just walked over there to check out what the signs said. Two steps out of the station doors, I had one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life and felt lucky that I managed to escape back up to the platform. I stared for a while at the old church in the distance, trying to resolve the dissonance of its classic beauty against the sights, smells, and touches I had just experienced, then read some Nick Land on my phone until my train finally arrived. You’re a brave man for venturing into the actual city, Z.

            Ohh for fux sake it’s not THAT bad.  I worked at Prudential right there @ Broad and Market for almost 3 years in the early 90s. Been in and out of that station hundreds of times.  I think there’s 4 platforms, plus PATH.  Newark PD keeps a strong presence.
My advice is to look and act with purpose.  Add some swagger to your step, so them dumb-ass f’n Moolies can tell they are not dealing with an easy target like Mort Goldman.  (Hell….. I grew up in California….but I picked up on the local vibe pretty quick.  LOL)

        Do I detect some empathy for our african invaders  ?  Believe on at least two occasions there’s been comments about somalis having difficulties in their new occupied land.Make no mistake have no love for Russians. Visit any Finnish Cemetery and  walk the rows of headstones from the Winter War .  That being said would still tolerate the company of a Russian over some “rape-ape”As a white man visiting other white countries I respect the people and local customs, contribute to the local economy and obey the law.  Doing so ( although after some initial apprehension common with any stranger ) locals have warmly invited me into their homes.The one thing all my European friends have stated is their disappointment when first visiting the USA. Of course their first exposure to America is Hollywood propaganda machine.They find it somewhat surprising and disappointing life in the states is nothing like what they see in TV and movies. Almost to a person they’re happy to visit but even happier to go back home.

            From the April 3rd “Travelogue: Tallinn” post, one of the commenters explained the taxi situation in Finland, which was very interesting. In case you missed it:Make:“Well Z, you arrived to Finland just in time to see the beginning of the collapse in the standards of Finnish taxi service. The taxi business used to be heavily regulated until recently, which meant reliable and good customer service, but also very high prices. Most of the drivers were Finns, and even the immigrants working as taxi drivers knew their job. The government liberalized the taxi market just last year, and now low IQ immigrants are being hired as taxi drivers, and people are complaining that they often can’t even find the place they are supposed to drive to.“This is a good example of how the people on the right have to change their thinking because of the demographic question. I used to vote for the National Coalition Party, which is our center right cuckservative party, and supported economic deregulation, including liberalizing the rigid rules that regulated the taxi market, and made the whole taxi business resemble a medieval guild.“I still support it in principle, but not anymore in practice, since in the “demographic age” economic deregulation often leads to flooding the labour market with Third World immigrants. So I won’t be voting for the cucks anymore, and I hope the populist Finns party will get an earth-shattering victory in the elections next week and, among other things, cancel the whole taxi reform. I’ll just bite my lip next time I have to pay 20 euros for a short taxi ride because I’m too shit faced drunk to walk back home from a bar.”http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16940It’s the “Cheapest is Best” disease wherein all social capital is tossed in order to save a few bucks, courtesy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
