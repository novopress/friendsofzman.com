        The fact that Rotten Tomatoes has now a 100% ranking for Black Panther shows the wide gulf between so-called ‚Äúcritics‚Äù and ordinary people.  I still laugh at how ‚Äúcritics‚Äù gave The Last Jedi a 92% ranking while only 49% of the audience liked it.  And I believe that score was too high given how everyone I know hated it.  Even my liberal friend ‚Äî who supported Bernie Sanders ‚Äî thought Admiral Holdo was an unnecessary SJW added for the diversity points.Gamergate predicted all of this.  All of the cultural civil wars we see going on now was begun in a small niche, when nerds felt that women were intruding too much in their domain.  In fact, it began as gamers noticed that video-game ‚Äúcritics‚Äù seemed to be siding with SJW progressive points and calling its demographic ‚Äúracist‚Äù, ‚Äúsexist‚Äù, what have you.  Gamergate I may also point out was probably the first successful counter reaction against SJW lunacy as us autists weaponized our autism via 4chan with fashy memes.  The battle hardened tactics we perfected was used to deadly effect during the 2016 election, which I believed played a role in getting The Donald elected.To see such rampant ideological black-white thinking makes me think that we are in an ideological bubble that will soon burst, much like what happened to Robespierre with the Thermidoran reaction.  In fact, I think it has already happened with the election of Trump.  The increasing stridency of SJW‚Äôs may just be a rear guard last stand after having lost the major battle.

            I don‚Äôt think I really understood the gamergate thing (and I may still not understand it) until I tried to buy a Nintendo Switch to play the latest Zelda take and couldn‚Äôt, so I started watching streams of people playing it to find out what it was like to get a bit of satisfaction. My sons and I watched several streams and came across a few with women playing the game. I‚Äôm not very judgemental and watched benignly, I just thought that it must be a difficult game; my sons noticed everything that was being done wrong and began pointing out to me how idiotically the game was being played. By people who were being payed to play it.Then after getting the game and playing it myself and watching my sons play it, it was even more starkly obvious. In a sane world most of those doing the streaming would have been gonged off the stage.Don‚Äôt let the nature of this post get you thinking too hard. None of my sons live at home, and I‚Äôm a grandfather. If I can play that game better than someone who makes a living playing games something is wrong.

                There‚Äôs a lot of things to come away with Gamergate.  I think the Zman pointed out that our age was a triumph of the nerds.  Back in the 60‚Äôs, it was very uncool and unpopular to be a nerd.  Constant propaganda from movies and popular culture were showing how cool it was to be a nerd.  By the 1990‚Äôs, nerds were in vogue, especially with the rise of Silicon Valley.  You can see that with shows like The Big Bang Theory.As with any trend, women jumped on the bandwagon.  Nothing against that, women are hardwired to follow the current fashions and trends.  That‚Äôs where you get the girl gamer and the geek girl memes.  Guys at first thought it was great that women were now playing video games.  Then they got annoyed when women were criticizing tropes in video games, such as Mario rescuing the helpless princess.  Women like Anita Sarkeesian were trying to make men better by getting rid of such sexist trope (sarcasm).  When guys said it was none of their business, you had critics and such calling them neanderthals and sexists.I think it also explains the current frustrations in the dating world.  Women, following the geek trend, claim that they love dating nerds and geeks.  Nerds and geeks, not understanding the true nature of women, then jump on the bandwagon, only to be frustrated time and again with women friendzoning them and claiming the Chad they‚Äôre dating is really the true geek they are looking for.Basically, it‚Äôs the story of nerds and beta males getting red pilled to the nature of women and by proxy, to how reality works (race, sex, etc.).

                    Eh, I‚Äôve been a geek girl since I was 12 and was reading sci-fi. I was a geek before it was kewl. I was not a gamer though; never had an interest in that. That, to me, was more of a guy thing ‚Äì although I‚Äôm sure some ladies liked gaming.Most of the guys I dated were either geeks or nerds and I married a smart geek (still married almost 40 years later).Nothing more annoying than fellows who deny that some women were geeks and nerds before all this SJW/‚Äùfeminist‚Äù crap. We were always there. We just didn‚Äôt make a lot of noise. And not all women are bad or hate men. Men are awesome. When I was young, I had plenty of male friends. I talked sports with them or sci-fi. I wasn‚Äôt one for the ‚Äúbad boys,‚Äù they were a pain in the ass. Give me a smart, kind geek any day of the week. I get along with nerds but I probably intimidate them a bit. But I ‚Äúget‚Äù them so know how to be kind/set them at ease.I still attend sci-fi conventions and I‚Äôm old now. Geeks rule! Down with the normies! üòâ (just kidding ‚Äì there are only two kinds of people in the world  ‚Äì nice ones and jerks.)

                    The rise of Geeky nerdy culture started getting a toe hold in the 80s. Two movies come quickly to mind-‚ÄúRevenge of The Nerds,‚Äù and ‚Äú16 Candles.‚Äù There were more, but these were primo examples. The idea of the jock being bad/dorks being cool, was the start of that archetypal narrative. The anti-white, upper crust snobby  WASP vs. The cool, fun-living Jew is best epitomized in ‚ÄúCadyshack.‚Äù (Bonus-it featured as the setting a ‚Äúwhites only/Jews not wanted country club).Taken together, this is the beginning of the rise of the modern day, cool, geeky Jew  Bugman.It became cool to be a noodle-armed, tech savvy, asthmatic  Jew  playing video games vs. the popular, athletic, good-looking, ladies‚Äô man, Aryan Chad.

                You really don‚Äôt need to understand the intricacies of Gamergate. But it‚Äôs one of those events that ends up having outsized importance for a few reasons.It taught a bunch of people (in this case gamers) that the left won‚Äôt leave you alone to do your thing ‚Äî you HAVE to fight back against the SJWs.Many of today‚Äôs Alt-Right ‚Äúcelebs‚Äù made their bones during GG, especially Milo.Vox Day developed the ‚ÄúThree Laws of SJWs‚Äù based on his experiences with GG and other SJW attacks. Credit to him for producing useful and generalized laws based on somewhat obscure and geeky events that most normies frankly don‚Äôt care about.

                I‚Äôm a grandmother who doesn‚Äôt play the vidya, (shocker!), but when GG started,  it was at a time when I was about 5 yrs into sock puppet trolling on Gawker media site and when it initially broke I was like, ‚Äúuhh, wut?‚ÄùWithin the next two days I obsessively read  GG threads, watched videos, and was all in. I sensed something pretty big  was happening, but I had no clue how big and what it would lead to.When I tell ppl today that Andrew Breitbart way back in 2010 taking screen grabs of Anthony Weiner ‚Äòs accidental tweets/penis pic, and GamerGate is the reason Trump got elected, they think it sounds insane.Ok, whatever, but I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôm right.

        Going to see the Black Panther movie and telling everyone how great and trans-formative it is will be the biggest thing in virtue signalling since voting for Obama.  White liberals will fall all over themselves to be seen praising it.
I guess the only response is ‚ÄúGuys, it‚Äôs a comic book movie not a documentary.‚Äù

        All very good points yet a lot of whites still participate in the Witch Hunt. Mention any of these talking points to the so-called normies and they immediately go on the defensive for blacks.   Used to get frustrated looking at places like Soviet Russia or Cuba wondering why those people wouldn‚Äôt free themselves from that oppression ?Now it seems clear. Decades of propaganda has conditioned people to have that default reaction to anything against the Deep State narrative.The predictions for this movie to break all box office records is truly insulting. It‚Äôs blatant propaganda but will our fellow citizens see it and call it out ?P,S. Good morning sir

            Whites don‚Äôt just participate in the witch hunt‚Ä¶ we invented the witch hunt. We ARE the witch hunt.White people love chastising and ridiculing other, wayward whites for lack of public virtue, in this case insufficient groveling before the mighty, magical Negro.Without white people, this film would have never been made and there would be no virtue signaling spiral in regards to watching it.Two Jewish guys from NYC invented the whole damned character and storyline for God‚Äôs sake.On some level, I actually feel sorry for black people who invest so much emotional energy in needing fantasies like this to boost their collective self esteem.But even worse are the deracinated Goodwhites who have created a religion out of worshipping black people and providing endless emotional and financial uplift for their favored pets.When will this ridiculous, stilted nightmare end ?

                Bravo, Dave.Like you I feel sorry for black people, who once had a template for living life with dignity ‚Äì behaving the way white people do ‚Äì working for a living, going to church, raising families, learning how to read, dressing properly, mores that we honkies worked out over millennia.The ruling elite smashed this template, because they require black people for another purpose: To help annihilate their class enemy, the normal white, who still hasn‚Äôt got the message that all the rule-of-law, virtue-of-work, live-and-let-live bullshit is OUT.Anarcho-tyranny needs enforcers; blacks have been ‚Äòdeputized‚Äô for this purpose. Sorry, black people, but when you vote 95% this way or that, you are OWNED. When your masters say jump, you jump!

            A prime directive in all totalitarian states is the atomization of the target population. Everyone wakes up lonely, tired, and scared, trusting no one; if out of sheer isolation they read the paper or watch TV, they bathe in the ‚Äúofficial truth‚Äù. Eventually their intellect succumbs to their loneliness, and they kind of give up, not so much by mindlessly shouting the accepted slogans, but by forgetting the habits and trains of thought of a free mind in association with other free minds.And here we are: The de facto criminalization of free association here in the US Empire is central to the atomization project.

        ‚ÄúThe more the other side tells us what they dream of when they sleep, the more white people wake up to the demographic reality that is facing them. Black Panther is the ultimate Dissident Right movie.‚Äù

            My thought exactly. No way in hell am I going to watch this delusional movie. I am also not as convinced as Paul Kersey that it is going to do well in the box office among whites.Can‚Äôt imagine Hispanics or Asians flocking to see it.

        In general I do not care for movies with lots of black people in them.   It will be very interesting to see how this turd does, once it opens.  Hard to see their being a large market for this movie; Asia/China can‚Äôt possibly be interested in such a nigfest.

                The AMC theater in Tysons Corner, VA has scheduled Black Panther as follows tomorrow:Standard screenings ‚Äî 15 showings; IMAX 3D ‚Äî 5 showings; 3D ‚Äî 4 showings; Dolby Cinema (high-end projection and sound) ‚Äî 6 showings. In one day, then, the multiplex will show the movie 30 times.This is an expensive theater in an elite mall, mainly patronized by whites, Asians, and trophy wives of high government officials and diplomatic staff.Does the theater management really believe they are going to make enough money to cover the costs of 30 screenings in one day (and I expect they will keep to the schedule for at least a week)? Or is this white shaming on an extravagant scale? Is AMC willing to lose money (by not showing other, perhaps popular, films to make room for BP) so as to demonstrate black ass kissing in excelsis?I wonder, too: if the theaters are mostly empty after the first day or two, how will the media react? Will the Washington Pest assign a (((hack))) to write an article strongly implying that whites are staying away because of racism?

                It‚Äôs a fair point you make, I‚Äôm Irish with a lot of extended family in the U.S, mostly based in New York/New Jersey with the remnant in Alabama and Atlanta. Of the family, one couple were teachers based in upper middle class New York. Nice people, but heavily swpl. Her bother lived in Jersey, very standard GOP voting family, the wife was hugely involved with the boy scouts and Methodist Church. The senior brother was a pilot for Kiwi airlines in Atlanta. We went over for a family holiday mid 90‚Äôs. The first thing I noticed in Atlanta was the sig sauer underneath the drivers seat, I asked what other guns he had and what game he hunted innocently enough. He replyed that the pistols were for his ‚Äòhomies‚Äô, and a rifle for deer. We stayed in a lovely all be it gated suburb. He made a few jokes throughout the trip about his ‚Äòhomies‚Äô and crime which we didn‚Äôt really get. Innocence is bliss, and a curse. In 2008 and the election of Obama our emails were in melt down from the swpl‚Äôs with pictures of the election night, the tension on Obama‚Äôs face, the relief when the final tally came through, the boundless optimism. I was happy enough for her but found it a bit ostentatious. The emails kept coming for a few days, enough Sam Cooke Change gonna come to OD on. It started to feel a bit orgiastic and ridiculous. Enter the Trumpening, Elder Cousin and his family have moved out of Atlanta years ago to lighter towns, standard GOP has stayed in nice white rural area. Swpl still raging against the Donald, although getting more muted. It‚Äôs a spectaculary bizarre thing I just can‚Äôt get, this need for self abnegation. Like Ted Cruz with his historcally delusional view of slavery as White America‚Äôs original sin. I see it even in some immediate family members regarding mass migration from Mordor/middle east. This ostentatious altruism. Richard Spencer can be a bit melodramatic but he made a comment about living in an age of the collapse of liberalism and the (hopefully temporary) deligitimisation of White people  as any kind of authority. It does seem like as Spencer said the way out is through unfortunatly

            If you‚Äôre unsure how they‚Äôll react, take note of how they reacted when the public puked on the ‚ÄúGhostbusters‚Äù all-female remake.

        This movie will be a gold and diamond mine for memes of mockery. Gen Z, and the Alt-right gang are going to have a field day with this. How long before every black no-go zone is nicknamed Wakanda? Whatever title the King of Wakanda has will be appended to every black hack seeking or holding office. BP promotional schlock will hit the .99 cent store by June. (Actually, Black Panther appeared in a Fantastic Four comic sometime around 1966. I had the issue.)

            I reckon quite a lot of people will go see it.  Not for the politics of it all, but because Infinity War comes out in May, and there are a couple MCU puzzle pieces that people are wondering about which Black Panther may answer.  A lot of Marvel fans will simply look at this as a sub chapter in a 20 movie serial.It is very uncommon for the production companies to lift the review embargoes more than a few days before the film opens.  BP reviews were allowed 10 days in advance.Marvel clearly thinks they have a hit on their hands.  It‚Äôs not like they go by the reviews.  These films are shown to their fan base, their target demos, etc.By comparison:  Star Wars: TLJ review embargo dropped 3-4 days before release.  Respectable.  Justice League I think was the day before, maybe two, and it is a crap movie.

        And yet another comic book movie. Only in the world of film fantasy can blacks finally achieve what whites and asians have done thousands of years ago. Where is their Aristotle, Shakespeare, Newton, Rembrandt, you know, anything? Oprah.
In the history of hubris and ingratitude they have achieved beyond all others. This is all egged on by you know who.
Anybody watch the Cloverfield Paradox? What a typical diversity parade with minorities positioned in the right order with requisite skills only white Nasa engineers had. That and their moral and physical strength.

        Slightly off topic but related to the excellent observation made in the column.  I was teaching yesterday and many of  my kids were distracted with their ipads (as usual) and not staying with the amazingly informative and provocative lesson that we were engaged in.  When asked what video games they were playing, many laughed and said the game ‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù, where much killing takes place.  When asked if they play these games in other classes, many, many students raised their hands.  Except for the very top echelon of students, not much critical thinking going on in our school, and we are considered one of the best.  The point here is that as long as the masses are addicted to technology, the slow march to the end of the cliff will continue.  I know the technology genie is out of the bottle so good luck with that.  The Black Panther Movie will be just another shootem up, brain dead creation, with the added anti-white agenda.  Most will not know the subtleties of what they are watching, but we all know on some level they get the intended message which is what the masters want,

        At the gym today, a black trainer was spotting some young skank; and after a while their conversation drifted on to movies.  He mentioned seeing the Black Panther movie; she asked if he liked it.
There was a pregnant pause before he said ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù in a completely unenthusiastic tone of voice.
Clearly we have a winner here.

                Negroes comprise only 13% of the population and many of them are far too burned out to be going to superhero films. Certainly a lot of them will see it, but it will be a success only if whites duppirt it.

It‚Äôs not a Black movie.It‚Äôs a white version of a black movie.An appeal- a fantasy appeal, at that.
It‚Äôs the same as white voters for Obama, begging him and Black America to finally act white.
Begging the inner Oreo to reveal itself, in all it‚Äôs hoped for and hidden glory.   Told ya they‚Äôre English gentlemen with dark skin, now aren‚Äôt they?  They have to conceal the Nobility Within cuz racism.

        LOL. Awesome!All spot on, as per usual too. But, perhaps a couple observations:I recently saw an interview with the fella that played the lead role in Hakuna Wakanda ‚Äì and he looked downright embarrassed as the entertainment media slobs fawned over and patronized him. It was embarrassing for me to watch as a viewer too. This movie isn‚Äôt about race, it is mostly about the domination of our entertainment industry by SJW‚Äôs. You WILL go see this, you filthy Dirt Person, and you WILL enjoy it ‚Äì or else! For me, I am calling: stuff your Chocolate Charlie up your arse Hollywood, and bring me the ‚Äòor else‚Äô ‚Äì I want to see what you have.As far as Rotten Tomatoes goes ‚Äì fuggem! Lookit this:http://www.millbankusa.com/filthycritic/I cannot wait for either you or Filthy to critique the show. You realize that you have to go to it now, right? üôÇFinally, I think it is mostly white people driving this crap.

        That whole sense that the left was filled with the ‚Äúsmart people,‚Äù that it was the ‚Äúreality based community‚Äù sort of worked for a number of decades. Probably spilling out from the New Deal ‚Äúbrain trust‚Äù and on to all the experts who told us about how slavery and Jim Crow kept blacks down even in the 20th century. But reality could only be denied so long. That black Dems have been in charge of so many big cities as long as they have shows the left has no ‚Äúreality-based‚Äù way to fix achievement gaps between blacks and whites. And the stridency of the ‚Äúbelieve this or else!‚Äù propaganda since the Obama years shows how desperate this is becoming for them. The (actual) wokeness of Gen Z on this stuff in encouraging.

        Personally, I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it.  Would love to know if they‚Äôve hidden that last Infinity Stone in Wakanda heading into ‚ÄúInfinity War‚Äù in May.The risk the media has with the Black Panther movie is what they tried to pull of with Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  Now, I rather liked The Last Jedi.  Was it girl-power agitprop?  You bet it was.  But, the point I feel I‚Äôve made successfully is that the girls managed to kill off all their warriors while reducing the Rebel Alliance to 25 people fleeing on the Millenium Falcon in total, humiliating, defeat.  Them‚Äôs the facts.But anyway, to my point about the reviews, SW:TLJ earned a ridiculously high 98% on RT as well.  It‚Äôs drifted down to 91%, but the AUDIENCE reviews are just brutal.  48%Everybody has figured out that those reviews are bought and paid for.  That‚Äôs not necessarily RT‚Äôs fault.  They‚Äôre a news-aggregator.  You could make the case that some of their ‚Äúfresh‚Äù reviews are actually B-, C+ reviews, but on the whole they are just reporting what 50-100-200 professional Left Wing movie reviewers are writing.So, in the last year or two, we‚Äôve had major tentpoles like Wonder Woman and Star Wars garnering absurdly over-the-top reviews from the Social Justice Warriors, along with all the usual agitprop films that get great reviews for their advancement of SJW messages (Zootopia).Without bringing left/right politics into it, I think people everywhere on the spectrum are waking up to the fact that the game is rigged.  Hillary‚Äôs candidacy was rigged.  The FBI/DOJ investigations are rigged.  Movie reviews‚Ä¶ARE RIGGED.Anyway, I hope it‚Äôs a good, fun, movie like the rest of the Marvel films. Some are better than others, but they‚Äôre all good old fashioned popcorn action flicks that ‚Äì the occasionally off-color joke aside ‚Äì the whole family can enjoy.  It‚Äôll be interesting to see if they try to explain-away the whole Royal Birthright Line-of-Kings thing by trying to make it look like Wakanda is a representative democracy and not the Feudal system that generally comes with Kings.  And like I wrote yesterday, if my kids ask about it, I‚Äôm going to tell them the truth:  The only way you get a wealthy, technologically advanced, secular, civil society, in Africa is to invent it in a comic book and cloak it in an invisible shield‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs not gonna happen.If Wakanda really existed, and they were sitting on a meteor full of vibranium, they‚Äôd have turned themselves into Venezula decades ago.  Or, been totally wiped out, and either the Brits, Germany, or the US would own it.

            I don‚Äôt go to theaters and around here, it would be a very idea for a pale face to go and see this opening weekend. Let the passions subside a little. I‚Äôll catch on Kodi at some point. but, I might head out to honkyville and see it and do a review. A two hour trip to a theater where I will have a low chance of being shot is a lot to ask.

            Incidentally, there is a magic dirt in the heart of the Congo.
Cal-tan.  95% of the world‚Äôs electronics require it.  Congo is it‚Äôs only known source.
Congo is also the world‚Äôs longest-running war theater.  Over 30 years since Joseph Kabila, then his son Lawrence.  Belgium‚Äôs former presence is only traces of impassable roads and the rusted hulks of what used to be factories.
The US has a mad African ‚Äúcolonel‚Äù in place now, protecting the mines.  Mai mai cannibals are the main threat locally.  Welcome to the real Wakanda!

        you made some excellent points here‚Ä¶but in your analysis you and the rest of the dissident right miss an important mechanism in the workings of our opposition‚Äìthe media is a corporate media, and it is funded by advertising revenues from ad buys by big corporations‚Ä¶.these big corporations spend profits on media ads‚Ä¶the more profits, the more ads‚Ä¶.the media is thus just an arm of these corporations‚Ä¶the media speaks for these corporations‚Ä¶the media is rabidly pro-nonwhite and pro-immigration‚Ä¶the media seeks to raise the social status of nonwhites and lower the social status of whites‚Ä¶occam‚Äôs razor tells us that this media propaganda works somehow to raise corporate profits‚Ä¶and sure enough 80% of the economy is based on consumer demand‚Ä¶and nonwhites and immigrants increase the number of consumers‚Ä¶there ya have it‚Ä¶but for some reason this sort of analysis is ignored by the dissident right‚Ä¶

        With respect to your third bullet point, I would add that it‚Äôs not so much a preference as it is an evolved reality. The proclivity for race-based association exists because it works, and is the culmination of a fitness gauntlet that goes back a few hundred thousand years. It is natural, not some recent invention or arbitrary creation.

        I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a more egregious example of agitpropaganda than this one:http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article200071384.html.  ‚ÄúHow my trip to the shooting range changed how I think about gun owners‚Äù  A story of a liberal visiting a gun range for his first shooting lesson, and meeting reasonable, sane, and maybe even likeable people.But the layout of this article is interspersed with multiple videos all screeching at top volume about the horrors of the recent school shooting.  It‚Äôs jarring to see such clumsy and obvious techniques being banally presented as if they were normal.  How dare you think of gun owners as being reasonable.This corresponds with the hype surrounding this ridiculous potboiler of a movie.  The movie will most likely do poorly, and all of this drivel will blow away.  Until the next ‚Äòchosen‚Äô topic arises.Believe nothing that you read and only half of what you see.

        Im late reading this but if Hollywood wont make media suitable to your tastes it looks like the youngsters are. Check out ‚ÄúMurdoch Murdoch‚Äù. Youtube regularly shuts them down but they are up on pewtube with over 6 hours worth of shows. Lots of altright inside jokes and memes but there actually have some deep insights into political thought if you pay attention. This link isnt the most insightful but it plays counterpoint to the post topic.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TvKsUX28Wvs

        Ooooo, out did yourself on this one, Zman ‚Äì putting the likes of ‚ÄúJones and Stone‚Äù to shame with the same argument.  Thx for reviewing something on which I won‚Äôt waste what remaining precious time I may still have remaining in this ‚Äúrealm‚Äù before ‚Äúplanting‚Äù myself one of these days.  Even though I don‚Äôt accept your ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù categorically, in so long as the underlying message is the INDIVIDUAL RIGHT to CHOOSE his/her/zer racial/ethnic/cultural/social association[s] . . . WHEREVER/HOWEVER, ‚Äúwe all be good‚Äù and I will continue to thoroughly enjoy your very regular and illuminating commentaries/observations ‚Äì carry on!
