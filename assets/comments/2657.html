        From what I hear, auto loans are going down the same path. Car bubble, anyone? The stock market run up has more to do with the lack of return from any other investments. Metal prices have been artificially depressed by short selling of leveraged paper substitutes for actual hold in your hand coins and bars. What’s left- bonds, CDs? Don’t get me started talking about real estate.

        What this proves is that government has jumped the shark and considers all money to be their own, which in effect it is. They printed it after all, and copiously. From the point of view of government the citizen is allowed to keep a rather large portion of it.
This plays no small part in the stampede into stocks. A private  asset is harder to confiscate than money is through devaluation, both in a legal and practical application. Cyprus, Argentina.
