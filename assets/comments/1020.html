        What the writer here is describing is also true about any Hispanic that goes to an emergency room, for any reason from a hangnail to a heart attack.  They always bring along their 12 kids, their parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents on both sides of the family, and two or three (or more) neighbors.  And, of course, the kids are all running around yelling and screaming and whining for goodies from the snack machine.  And it does not matter what time of the day or night they are there.And the ER people can’t do or say anything about the chaos, because then just about every Hispanic in the surrounding counties would be screaming racism, taking their cue from the black race hustlers.

        Very interesting point about the firms that exist to rent out Indian programmers. What a racket!

        Two slam dunk points – bringing in unskilled labor when the trendy economists are declaring the end of labor – and wages are stagnant – and kids are stupid but not dumb. They know STEM is hard and they realize that the wages are artificially kept low via outsourcing and H1B. This stuff is so obvious but since you don’t use fancy math nobody important will accept it.

        Pay for engineers and programmers has been stagnant for two decades. Kids are not that dumb.
Not sure where you are getting this from. Do you mean real wages? This chart shows nominal wages have been risinghttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OzWmi586OUQ/TgjVLW1t5sI/AAAAAAAAA0Q/VzJVf5OFKmo/s1600/eng-salary%2Bby%2Bdisc.jpg

            Three things: One, take the top line and do a little inflation math. The salary of 66K in 1999 is the same as $92K in 2013 according to the BLS. Fred the programmer has kept up with inflation, if you believe the inflation numbers from the government. Second, the average age in Fred’s field has steadily climbed. Got to a programmer’s conference and it looks like God’s waiting room. Not all of them for sure, but we have a lot of Boomers in the programming field. Finally, the barrier to entry is higher now than thirty years ago. It costs a lot more to be a programmer than it did when I was entering the job market.
