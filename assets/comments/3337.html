        “Diversity” has also not worked in Belgium; anywhere in the Middle East; in Africa where the colonials established borders irrespective of the various tribes within those borders which has produced the never ending inter-tribal massacres; the former Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia; and in Canada where the English speaking Canadians cannot wait for the Quebecois to leave the Federation and where it is nigh impossible to find a non-Quebecois who can actually speak french in an “officially” bilingual” nation; and in India which in 1948 split into Pakistan and India, and subsequently was joined by Bangladesh.Upon the demise of the USSR, despite 75 years of forced integration, its various nation-states ALL decided to go their own way.Diversity apparently was not wanted there either.And yes, before the white man ever set foot in N.America, the indian tribes – though not all of them – would attempt to exterminate their fellow tribes. Note that EVERY tribe had “warriors,” and warriors were assigned certain tasks; to defend their tribes ( from what, if their were no whites around) or to find and kill the other guys. The notion of diversity, apparently was not too popular amongst the indigenous tribes, pre-white man.In NYC, the Puerto Rican population, despite OVER 50 years !!!! of living there , still is near the bottom of the socio-economic ladder and still has many 3rd and 4th generation individuals who cannot speak un-accented english and consider english their second language. Diversity does not seem to be that imporyant to them either.The mexicans in S.Cal have ZERO desire to assimilate and soon a few hundred thousand of them will agitate and demonstrate to “free” themselves from the USA and form their own nation or “rejoin” Mexico.When hundreds of thousands take to the streets, there is nothing anybody can do to stop them.Diversity to them means getting rid of the gringo.Diversity is a left wing ploy  – a VERY effective ploy – to break a nation and create chaos, for it is ONLY under chaotic conditions that they can take – by force, by terror, by murder- power.As for New Haven, well, you can bet your life- literally- that the totally hypocritical  Yale University professors do not send THEIR kids to any majority black school. Like all liberals, they are for ” social justice” and big government as long as they and their kin are exempt from any of its policies.

        The cult is a refuge for individuals who have turned their backs on the church and have a longing to be part of something that gives them a feeling of acceptance. The way they lead their lives would not be accepted by the church. Public schooling teaches them to embrace homosexuality, abortion and unfaithfulness. They grow up thinking that this is who they really are and this just doesn’t go well in front of the other parishioners.  So Liberalism it is.The noisiest members of the group are always the most recent converts with something to prove. That’s why so many of them are willing to humiliate themselves in public and sacrifice their dignity in order to show they belong.

        You are right, modern liberalism is a religion. Religions are generally not thought of as a collection of facts, but beliefs. The Left “believes” in its causes, so of course it must be so.If this desegregation thing in Hartford isn’t scrapped soon, I would expect a step-up in white flight from the confines of that school district. And if they think they can go farther afield for more education victims to bus around? Backfire, like all their stupid plans. I guess they’ll never learn that you can’t force people together who might never have chosen it themselves. They also forget that people are free to leave that state altogether. Connecticut is a physically lovely state for the most part, but its Leftism is a real liability.
