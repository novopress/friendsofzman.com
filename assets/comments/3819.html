        When the gansta Mexican demographic forcibly ejected the gansta black majority out of Compton, crime dropped dramatically to very high levels.

        Moslems do not bring down crime in a neighborhood. Maybe the types of crime change? You can expect that crimes of a sexual nature will increase dramatically. Maybe armed robbery rates decline? Assaults will increase. Property destruction. Then the car burnings start.And you are right, Z, about the burqa statement. They are flaunting the fact that they have come to conquer our land. They are setting themselves apart, using their Costumes of Submission, to let us infidels know that they have absolutely no intention of assimilating and that we better get used to it. Every time I see one I get a queasy feeling.

        Meanwhile, this morning’s coffee was accompanied by MSNBC bestowing “Global Citizen Awards” to a couple activist types.The award was for helping establish water wells in Kenya.  (In olden days it would simply be American aid, or Christian charity, and in any case “the right and decent  thing to do”.Now it’s a marker for Global Citizenry.(BTW – can anyone tell me what is it with Kenya and water wells?  This was the umpteenth story I’ve seen on this topic.  Surely there must be other parts of the world in need of potable water.  Kenya has become the Bakken of water well drilling.)

        The only thing I know about Woodrow Wilson is that he was chosen to be POTUS by Bernard Baruch.

We have to hope it is. but, I think his intense hatred of Americans will override everything. Obama has been described as the least American president since Wilson, but Jeb Bush will test that argument.
