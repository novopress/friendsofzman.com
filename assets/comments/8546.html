        The very disturbing questions:Can we trust what the media reports? noCan we trust the government tells us? no.Can anyone believe a word out of obama’s lying mouth? noIs there anyone who speaks with credibility on any aspect of this mess? No.Trust level all around is zero.Not a foot to stand on. No solid ground.Everyone is reduced to wild ass guessing. None of us has has a clue.Happy fucking 9/11

                Sounds like Kathleen is a “Fifty Shades” kind of gal! Just wrong  an ignorant in her kinky assessment. Trump, as always is out campaigning and ignoring the dead vagina stumbling. he’s simply following Napoleon’s maxim: “Do not interfere when your enemy is busy destroying herself!”

                    You’re a moron. All I meant was that Kellyanne is a good campaign manager and making sure he does not open up his mouth at the wrong time, as he has in previous occasions. She obviously told him not to respond in a way to draw any attention to himself, and away from the Hildabeast. That you could draw some kind of kinky reference says much about your thought process, not mine.

        Well if the US Congress must intervene somehow in the event that the normal election process gets discombobulated, you can bet your house, car, your IRA,  401K and your entire family that the Republicans will totally make the wrong decisions and literally hand over the election to whomever the dems choose.
As good as the dems are at F’ing over this nation and the citizenry, they could not have done it without the help of the republicans.
And the republican leadership is still flummoxed and clueless that THE DONALD won the nomination.What morons.

        In the Matrix you can promote and hide the serious health issues of the political class’s candidate with all manner of lies. The point is to get her elected so that the powers already in place can finish the job of ‘fundamentally changing’ America. If they can just keep her alive. If she becomes irretrievably incapacitated or expires before election day, depending on how close to deadline, they would likely lie about that as well. We’d be told she had a relapse or something and needed her rest even as she was growing cold and stiff in a locked room. Think about that for a sec. That they are capable of perpetrating that level of deception is a stunning revelation of how far into the state of being an ‘empire’ we have sunk.I’ve been pondering the possibilities would be in the event they just cannot keep her alive in spite of modern medical miracles in a syringe. Suspended elections is the likeliest of scenarios. Some have suggested that Valerie (uh, Obummer)  might just carry on. Who could/would stop this? Acting prez Ryan sounds quite plausible too though. That way Jarret would be able to continue without missing a beat. In this option, given that she is becoming a liability, seems like Hitlery might need to worry that the next syringe administered by her neurologist could be something that would produce a more lasting result. .The truly scariest of thoughts is that they can do whatever they want to do and we are pretty much helpless to stop them without unleashing an anarchy that they are quite prepared to squelch. Don’t think they aren’t ready for all contingencies.

                Here’s what I know about the psychopathic thought processing – especially the Clinton Crime family – first – they reside mostly in their own alternate realities and they don’t really know average Americans at all. So, they continued to believe that the same rhetoric and manipulations from the media to the dumbed downs would work much the same as it did in ‘08 and ’12. They were not prepared for the unknown masses, who are sick of the same ole, same old, to rise up and embrace the likes of Trump.In their alternate world they are certainly prepared and expectant that Hil will win. When I said they are prepared I am talking about prepared to use force, in the event the unwashed masses (the dirt people?) decide to fight back.

                    I suspect that, if the Repubs elected in 2012 has actually stood up to Obama, they would have been able to run Bush or Rubio like they wanted. Their failure to do so, after running on a platform to stop him, is what caused the anger.

            The press wouldn’t notice if they stuffed and mounted her and gave her mechanical lips that spew the party line.After all, that is all that really matters.Us deplorable’s and our interests don’t count anyway.After their done with her in the elections, they can just set her in the chair in the oval office, George Soros and Humin can sign the executive diktat.

        I am astonished how little the American mainstream media cares about the fate of the United States. The issues surrounding the election of arguably the most powerful person in the world have as far as I can see from the damper side of the Atlantic, barely been examined. The collective MSM act of sweeping any relevant questions under the carpet means these people don’t regard the future of their profession, their employers or even their own well-being of being of any importance.perhaps all the journalists and commentators and pundits in the States have some private agreement that when the sh*t hits the fan they will personally be protected. Maybe the belief in the gilded halls and polished offices of the hacks is that all media outlets will immediately have tanks positioned outside the moment anything goes wrong. It is possible they have been told the National Guard will personally escort them to and from work and to their favourite restaurants when it all goes teats up.However it is possible they either don’t care because they are exhausted peddling the untruths (or more accurately, working hard to suppress the truth) or know whatever they do, the game is up and they are toast.I have commented on these pages before about the fact I used to work in newspapers, but one thing I learned right from early on in the business was that a good journalist will be eager to say: “Hang on, there’s a story here.” It’s in their DNA. Yet bizzarely none of them seem to saying that when all around them is breaking one of the most staggering and fascinating stories of our time.

        The “creepy feeling” meter needle is stuck in red right now.  Am neither superstitious or a follower of conspiracy cults.  But did train originally as a historian and do not like the way a plethora of seeming unconnected events are lining up.  This is just another one in the pattern.

            Brandon Smith (BTW, really good writer…opinions and explanations in a clear, concise manner) has been writing about the coming banking collapse for a while now.He posits that TPTB are going to be quite happy if Trump wins. Then they and the Left/Progs can impugn the collapsing economies all on him.But if/when, for example, the EBT/welfare structures go south there *will* be open bloodletting in the streets by the Blacks. I, for one, would welcome that because the armed White populace would gladly put it down and simply allow the big cites to burn and a massive political retrenchment would occur. Additionally, Trump would have no hesitation to turn the Army loose on the streets. Remember when JFK sent the 101st Airborne to the South to force integration? The precedence was set (or we could go back to the tyrant Lincoln for another example).http://alt-market.com/articles/3000-the-central-banks-are-now-ready-to-launch-their-brave-new-world

        I’m reminded of the old Chinese curse, “may you live in interesting times”.
If the next few months go poorly I may eject from this country into a relative backwater: When Hitler got elected, von Neumann said “bad, bad things are going to happen here” and left to America. Hitler was right, but von Neumann was more right. I think we’re at a historical watershed moment on par with that of 1933.

                No. Hitler got a lot of things very right, at first, but he was standing up against the weight of the world, which ultimately crushed him and his country, and drove him insane along the way.

                        Soooo, what’s your opinion of the other guy who started WWII and killed 20 million of his own people before that, Uncle Joe Stalin? Remember Uncle Joe and Dolf had a pact to jointly invade Poland one from the west and one from the east, which they both carried out!  Uncle  Joe then doubled down on his evil, when he then executed 30,000 Polish military officers in the Katyn Forest.Did Joe magically become a good guy simply because Dolf turned on him? Or did the US pick the wrong guy to war upon, based upon the persuasive powers of a greatly Soviet-infiltrated regime acting upon a weak and compromised FDR?

        It is what is very rotten with the whole set up that is what you have to be concerned with. The set up being, there was always TINVOWOOT, (There Is No Voting Our way Out Of This), to begin with, if that was not true, anybody dropping out would not be an existential political event, to begin with.The whole charade is predicated on the fig leaf of the appearance of choice, that giving just the appearance of choice made it possible to run a charade, where the outcome was ordained, where just enough of vote rigging and gerrymander allowed the anointed next POTUS to win with the appearance of squeaking by for the “win” on the fringes of margin of voting poll error. And that relies on the appearance of legitimacy.It also relies on the appearance of a viable “candidate” who is the anointed one.It is why HRC is always within a percentage point or two of Donald Trump, it was how Obama was able to “win” two elections. You squeak out the “win” by rigging the popular vote count with just the amount of vote fraud that gives you a 3 point victory.But here’s the the thing, like everything these sonofabitches do, it is corrupted, there is not really any alternatives if something goes wrong, because the win is fixed on the fix is in and not much else.The fallback was a cuck was to run against the oven mitt, handing the win to her, or if the cuck was “elected” instead for some unforeseen reason, they had a marxist light to keep the destruction of America going until the next anointed usurper could be imposed upon us.But Donald Trump is not that cuck, he is an insurgent running an insurgency. His “Deplorable” status is about the fact he isn’t the preordained cuck stalking horse. It has nothing to do with his policy planks or his popularity with the dirt people and the deplorables. It is because he is not a component of the vote charade.They could care less what you or I or Trump thinks says or votes. Because that was pre-ordained, but now they are in a serious pickle, and because Trump IS The Great Fuck You, they have a real problem, there is no way they can take a newcomer “candidate” and give him or her a popular polling appearance that gives him or her a win with the popular vote so they can give him or her the electoral college fix and make it look legit enough to avoid a revolution.So what they will probably do, knowing Trump can only win, regardless of what improvised shinnanagin’s they try to pull, because the deplorables and dirt people are rather restyles and oh so very suspicious, is they will pull a crisis as a means, probably in some false flag event where congress, the Nazgul writing wraths in the Supreme court, or even the present usurper ion the oval office can rescind the checks and balances and appoint him another term, or maybe declare Martial Law. (Which the stage for Martial Law has been pre-set in a myriad of ways, just in case its needed). Martial law, it’s declaration solves a lot of problems, first it is “Constitutional”, it rescinds all forms of government, legally, where the “President” has full powers over everything. No more Congress, no more wring wraiths in black robes, no more Habeas Corpus, the 1st and 2nd Amendments are a foregone conclusion, and the length of Martial Law is at the sole descretion of the “president” who declares it. It is all spelled out in the USC,. Think that is conspiracy theory tin foil battery? Think again, Martial Law is essentially executive fiat, diktate, a pen and a phone, all wrapped up in a nice tidy package that solves every problem inhibiting the destruction of the USofA as we know it. And it is perfectly legal. They get to hide, in the most ultimate way imaginable, behind the rule of law they make us all obey yet they ignore to their benefit and leisure.It is the Tyrants of amerika Easy Button.

            Based on my observations, we are already 80% of the way there.  A formal declaration of martial law only makes it “official” and puts troops on the streets.  What happens next is the big question.  “Do not go gentle into that good night …” – Dylan Thomas

                That is just it like you say.They have their dicks, or is vagina’s, caught in a ringer. They will have to destroy whatever forlorn beat up fig of legitimacy that remains to salvage this debacle. Regardless, the deplorable’s will be thrown under the bus, you can count on it. Yet they have another problem, it is the double standard of crisis of legitimacy, the ancient Chinese mandate of heaven conundrum. What they destroy, the wreckage of a constitutional republic, has to itself be destroyed, if freedom is to evolve to it’s next level in it’s evolution. The idea of liberty requires it, demands it. There is an outlier in all this a smoldering nobody is talking about. There are lots of deplorable’s who grok it is far past, waaay past restoration or recourse, there is no redressing the FUSA and going back, in that comeuppance and revenge is the first order of business, everything else is secondary. That nothing can be left to reinfect freedom with cultural marxism, it is the only way. That is something that is beginning to dawn on the deplorable’s. The Alt-Right gets it, it is why it is the Alt-Right. there is going to be many of the Great Fuck You of Trump voters who are going to turn into The I’m Gonna Get You Sucka’ Party if the rug is pulled out from under them. Pulling the rug out on the Deplorables at this stage is the kind of dis-enfranchise that starts revolutions that are all but impossible to put down, in fact they have a historical precedence of being winning revolutions, because they are open source insurgency’s, provincial, and unquestionably spontaneous grass roots cascade preferences. The kind of a plurality with a bone in it’s teeth.Hard to define, even harder for many to talk about, never mind accept. But being outliers and making people uncomfortable doesn’t negate the truth of such.There isn’t the scope and scale of preps and weapons purchases going on because everyone doing so is going to hide out at their bug-out redoubts and play tiddlywinks.If you have any sense of history, you know it is circular, and being unprepared to be proactive, or more, is what keeps you from taking the dirt nap first. Never mind good old fashioned payback. And those who deserve it among the political class have earned that distinction richly.

            A handful of years back, there was a Congressman from Oregon who had lost his marbles. He was dressing up as stuffed animals and assaulting people. His staff hid all of it a he was running for reelection. After the election the truth got out and he had to resign.
The point being, Clinton’s staff will hide very serious health problems. At this point, it’s probably their singular focus.

                I have personally talked (or embarrassed) two young women out of voting for Hillary. You may think me a Wizard. Alas, my powers do not extend so far as votes for Trump. Today one of those ladies said what struck her most of all about the video of Hillary stumbling about today was the complete lack of surprise exhibited by the security agents. Very telling to her.The first debate is in two weeks. I don’t think anyone in the progressive party is going to rip that date out of Hillary’s claws, which leads them farther down the road of no return. I can tell you right now that the really cool people expect Kaine to take over and all for the better. They don’t know Hillary. Like Adolf, if she is going down the Reich is going with her.I do suspect that the Cucks will be eager to co-operate with the Progs. This would make for the most interesting election in American history, and if one or two of your scenarios plays out the ramifications will be enormous.

                    Progs allegedly plotting to drop a house on Hillary
I keep being reminded of Howard Dean’s campaign. For weeks the press pretended that he was sweeping to victory. After he finished third in Iowa, it was revealed that he was playing to empty chairs and his campaign buses were empty. We keep getting sneak pics of Clinton events where the crowd is dressed as empty chairs.

                    A doctor has no obligation to the pubic, with regards his opinions of his patients, outside of something extraordinary like a patient with an infectious disease. Usually, doctors just avoid saying anything unless instructed to make a statement from the patient.

        Let’s look at it another way. It looks like the financial bubble is about to pop again. The elites may decide it would be better for that to happen under a Republican administration. They hang back for four years then ride in to rescue the economy. It would let them focus on the down ticket races too.

            I’m not so sure.  I would tend to let both police and military ranks separate and/or clean house as I do not believe most are willing to serve a corrupt government.  Their leaders might be and they should be the first to go, but the regular joes could be real useful if allowed to join in.  Not all are sell-outs.  Bureaucrats are another matter.

                There’s a caveat though – there are already foreign troops here all over the place. Russian and Chinese for sure. There are at least two camps in Georgia, the kind with barbed wire on the top of the fence, manned by Arabs. The great unknown is whether or not or how many police will side with the people instead of hedging their bets and aligning with the gov? Not too many defectors in 1938 Germany. All one has to do is look at history to make predictions about human nature.

                    Let me make myself clear here – I support the men and women who put their lives down on the line every day. I have a nephew who is a cop in Ferguson and I can tell you many prayers went up for those brave souls on the front line of manufactured war.
On the other hand I am quite realistic about human nature and counting on the majority to side with rebels is not a good bet.

                “Law Enforcement” in this country has been serving a corrupt government for YEARS.  They consistently do WHATEVER they are told, as long as that paycheck keeps comin’ in.  And the Elite stand behind their Blue Wall and laugh.I would merely remind you that every weapon provided to the cartels was a separate felony.  Best estimate is that there were TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED weapons moved.  NOT ONE of those responsible was touched.  Furthermore, Comey very clearly spelled out MULTIPLE felonies committed by Clinton in the e-mail treason.  INTENT was not required for those to be felonies.  Yet she will NOT be touched.  Add in IRSgate and tell me again how police will “clean house” because “most are not willing to serve a corrupt government“.  There are at most a few dozen truly good cops in this entire country.Happiness is dead pigs.

We have NO FBI and we have NO AG – Killery Billary Rotten Klinton – you know, the one who was named for Mt. Everest and helped her father build the log cabin in which she was born – is above the law.  The whole rotten Klinton Krime Family is above the law.  And they find pigfuckers to do their dirty work for them.  Cheryl Mills, Huma Weiner, or Mrs. Danger,, Loretta Lynch, Comey – it is astonishing that the head of the FBI would roll over for the white trash that is the Klinton Krime Family.as the Romans used to say – “for my friends- everything; for my enemies – the law”

        I’ve thought for years that this country would have a second revolution, albeit a bloodless one. The last couple of years have convinced me that it will not be bloodless. Your option about party insiders putting one of theirs into the White House would almost certainly lead to that end.

            Democratic Party rules dictate the composition of the committee that would select the replacement. Sanders would have a lot of his people in the room as delegates. No other candidate would have spear catchers in the room, making a case for them. With time of the essence, having somewhere near 30% of the delegates demanding Sanders be the choice, it is likely some portion of the rest flip to his side.
But, your girl is not dead yet so you have that.

            Hilary has pneumonia. Pneumonia can kill you, especially if you’re old. I don’t think it could be plausibly argued that if she were to die or drop out because of illness, it would be a momentous event. This therefore seems like realistic analysis to me. Here is the definition of option from my dictionary: a thing that is or may be chosen. Unless you’re talking about stock options, or Blackstone’s definition, it means pretty much the same in any context.

        That HRC is unfit to be president can no longer be doubted by any reasonable individual, but there is no shortage of the unreasonable, so the issue remains. If her health fails and there is a “stay” put on the electoral process, sham though it may be, any chance of reasonable debate will evaporate; pitchfork time will have come, and if it comes and goes, so goes the last semblance of the land of the free and the home of the brave.

            You haven’t dealt with many of the Hillary faithful, have you? To them, this is still a bunch of unproven attacks on her with no basis in fact. It’s always amazing to see the Leftie thought process.

                “It’s always amazing to see the Leftie feel process.”FIFY! There is no thought involved for Lefties.
Gotta admit that body double they trotted out was good, but not entirely convincing, especially since she was too spry for someone who was close to being a corpse a couple hours earlier and the double’s hips and thighs, though wide, were not “fat-wide” like the Hill thing’s, if you catch my drift. Look again. Also note the double was not surrounded by SS agents as the Hill thing has to be, by their strict SS policies.

        Hillary will make it through the election. She obviously has problems but doesn’t appear to be quite on death’s door; her worshippers don’t care anyway. If she wins, she will resign in a few months when the hackers start releasing the Sec of State emails. VP Kaine will pardon her and be President the rest of the term. Warren will run for President in the next election. The dems turn to hard core left will be complete.

            nope she’s done.  Its a one man race from here on out.  The damage that has been done is irreparable.  You can see it the panic in the eyes of the minions rushing out to spin the lies in the media today.  The polls may be jacked to continue to show this as a tight race, but it is a done deal.

                    Yep. It’s long since been in the bag. All they got to do is keep her semi-animate until after January. The trick will be how to let her dodge the debates without appearing weak to her worshippers.

        “Congress does not have the power to dictate when people vote.”Actually they do —“The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof;but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations,except as to the Places of chusing Senators.You then in the same graph —“Congress could work with the states to postpone the election to December 3 in order to sort things out.”Reality is so long as Congress were to pass a law for postponement prior to their winter recess it could be done. The real crux of the matter is in the injection of a new face to the ballot. Over half the states it is already past deadline to file for and arrive on the ballot come the election whether postponed or not.

        Over at Vox Day’s:https://voxday.blogspot.com/2016/09/a-dubious-internist.htmlI suggested a ”Weekend at Bernie’s” scenario; Dead, but for the purposes of the election, treated as though still alive. Assuming she beats Trump in the popular vote, the Electoral College ratifies it, then on inauguration day Tim Kaine is sworn in as if Hillary dropped dead with her burning hand still on the Bible.
