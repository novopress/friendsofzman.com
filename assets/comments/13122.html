        ““Trending in Twitter” is becoming a way for Progressives to know what they are suppose to like and, more important, what they are supposed to hate. Right wingers on social media scramble the signal.”
Brilliantly succinct.  I’m totally stealing this.

        There may be opportunists trying to gain control of the hive. That’s my current working theory: the hive is getting whipsawed as different entities attempt to take control of it. Since they can only influence the hive through the pheromone-like means you mention, the hive is especially agitated as different and sometimes conflicting waves of control propagate through it.I think that you may very well be right and that these are spontaneous phenomena instead and that the Internet and social media have removed all the loss and distortion in transmission, leading to these very high amplitude events. But given history, I would bet that there is at least one charismatic psychopath out there trying to take control. There has always been a strong relationship between psychopathic leaders and the hive. Again, one of those things that evolved in agricultural societies as a defense mechanism but tends to spiral out of control with the invention of newspapers, telegraphs, and packet switching.You’ve come up with a very good synthesis.

        I suspect this hive reaction is caused by most of its inhabitants being godless and having no answer for death. They are disturbed by it and have no vision how to combat it ( notice they have no utopian concepts regarding death) so when it is starkly thrust  upon  them on a large scale they get irrational, flaying their arms and legs in hopeless rage.This country may be ripe for  a revival.

        If there was no one or no thing to hate then the left would cease to exist.  It’s whole existence is built on the negative. I don’t argue with liberals (a complete waste of time) I just tell them to fuck off, preferably right to their face. Has worked for me for nearly 60 years.

            YES.Trying to argue with leftists becomes something that only ends up pissing YOU off.  I finally learned my lesson a number of years ago – and now I carefully construct my arguments for making sure they’re maximally effective in pissing THEM off.  Since lefties live on feelz – go for the jugular.  Find the holes in their armor – and then insert words that will piss them off.  This way you insert misery and pain into their lives – in the same way their control of the culture and of government is used constantly to insert pain into yours.I have found this strategy to be very effective and also very satisfying.  Watching a lefty walk away from a casual comment with the veins bulging out of his neck and his face ten shades of red – makes me feel all warm and tingly inside.  It’s the bright spot in my day.

        Fortune favors the bold Leftist.  The hive mind is very evident every time there is a mass shooting or terrorist event.  The villains are tailor made for problem, reaction, solution.Sandy Hook-guns, gun controlBoston bombing-jihadis, we must fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them hereLos Angeles-misogynist, smash the patriarchy, gun controlCharleston-racist, iconoclasm, gun controlPulse-homophobe, support for homosexuals, gun controlDallas police-BLM, support police, gun control, another conversation about police and racismSan Bernardino-jihadis againUmpqua-jihadis againLas Vegas-guns againParkland-guns againAnd so on.  Wash, rinse, repeat.The solution is organized and ready to go.http://thefederalist.com/2018/03/01/take-two-weeks-truth-emerge-parkland-students-astroturfing/The lightning fast and high level support and response from the left are very serendipitous if not organized.  The progressives sure are lucky when it comes to mass murder.  Somehow it’s always something they can exploit to advance their goals.  The only event that varies slightly in the above list is the Dallas police shooting.  Recognizing the pattern ushers in the whole “correlation does not equal causation” argument. So maybe it’s all purely coincidental hive mind, “never let a good crisis go to waste”, instinctively working in concert,  organic rallying around the cause.  They certainly have their points and agitprop infrastructure in place, though.

            The recent two minutes hate against the NRA certainly looked co-ordinated and planned. The whole thing went off like a well-oiled machine, with the only glitches being the astonishingly incompetent behavior of the EBI ans Sheriff Israel, and the refusal of most American gun owners to be intimidated.
It’s pretty obvious to me that this whole campaign was already in place, right down to the twitter talking points, and was only waiting, vulture-like, for the next mass shooting. Ghoulish in the extreme, but that’s the Left for you.

                I concur re: appearance of pre-established anti-NRA coordination at the Parkland shooting.  Many yrs ago I attended a very liberal/relatively wealthy community high school with lots of well-spoken kids who were used to being “on stage” as it were, with poise to spare, just like the Stoneman Douglas kids.  On a spring day c. 1960 a bunch of these charmers ran out of the classrooms and lowered the American flag in the school courtyard because they heard that convicted rapist Caryl Chessman had just been executed at San Quentin, I think it was.  These leftist students got in “trouble” for doing this, but the one who got in the most trouble was the school principal.  He was toast/gone by the next fall for daring to discipline this gang of Maoists!

                    Yeah, I remember Chessman. He was a kidnapper and armed robber who savagely sodomized a 17 year old girl. If ever anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Chessman, so of course he became a hero to the Left. Alan Alda, Lord help us, even played him in a movie.
He was white, by the way.

                We’ve been “lucky” in the sense that most of these incidents have highlighted the utter fecklessness of the leviathan state.   So the edge of these preplanned responses is dulled as the facts roll out.  Luck is not a strategy.

                There seems to be more – much more – of this behavior on the left ,  but that may be just attributable to the fact that lefty talking points seem to get much more press in the current US social/political climate.I wouldn’t discount hive like behavior coming out of the right either.  A previous post mentioned ISIS and jihadis.  When we were seeing all the head chopping over in the Levant – and as terrorist incidents over here were getting attributed to ISIS  – there was quite a bit of hive-similar behavior coming out of people who would describe themselves as right wing.  This usually involved demands for US nuking Syria and beliefs that somehow the ISIS blue water navy was laying in wait just outside the 200 mile territorial limit – for that opportune moment to launch an all out invasion of the US mainland.

        That is a great description of lefty group behavior.  They seem to be swarming more and more lately.
They also ignore and suppress information that’s inconvenient to them.This story got buried in the media because it doesn’t fit the narrative.

                That’s rather amazing. I don’t think we are far from the news using fake images and fake video. They coach people to be interviewed at protests. How long before the news is running stories about the state rounding up Nazi subversives and showing video that was produced on a movie lot? I think there is a Philip K. Dick story to this effect.

                    We may already be there.  Back when Obama was in office and there seemed to be serious talk about the US getting heavily involved in Syria – there were numerous stories popping up on the intarwebs about how the the latest “they gassed a baby!!” story to appear in the worldwide media – was a fake.I remember seeing some of these “Fake!!” articles and they had pretty extensive documentation about how the stories were faked.Given the high political stakes at the time – and the cloud people’s need to convince some hive behavior from the neocon dick licker gotta have another war types – it makes perfect sense that they’d go to great lengths to come up with a story sufficiently convincing to get the “OMG there’s a dead baby on the beach!!” types to buy into full scale US intervention in Syria.

        Excellent analysis.  This also explains the progressive behavior in the deep state.  No one had to tell Lois Lerner to single out tea party groups.  The FBI, Justice Department and intelligence agency progressives all knew how to attack the Right, with no central coordination.  Freed from any constraint to follow the constitution or laws by their “means justify the ends” beliefs, they picked up the hive signals and went to work.  It was a massive conspiracy with no paper trail.  Progressives believe the intuitive coordination is simply common sense, so they think we are nuts for seeing the conspiracy.

        When the Left went all crazy about “net neutrality”, I took to asking them what “net neutrality” actually is—a definition of the term.  All I got back was “the end of the net/our culture/the world as we know it”.  It was obviously not about the issue at hand, it was all about the coordinated and manipulated agitation.

        The hive seekers are classic “r” selected rodents with short life spans, and low time preference, who are dominated by their emotions, especially fear. Their enemies are “k” selected survival oriented individualists with long time preferences, a devotion to reason and understanding reality.Hence, attempting to reason with the hive mind is useless.

        Z Man;The hive mentality is excellent description of Prog media (how Sobran mostly used it, I believe) : Field notes if you will.  But the metaphor is a bit off for the current situation: After all, bees are pretty much theoretical libertarians – they’ll (mostly) leave you alone if you leave them alone.Fire ants are probably a more apt comparison.  They are vicious, predatory and expansionary.  They’ll take over your yard if you let them and sting, maybe kill, any pet (or kid) of yours that wanders near one of their ever-spreading nests.  This matters because the main point is what to do about them.  Unlike bees, neither Progs. nor fire ants are content to leave us alone.With fire ants, you have to poison the queen with an attractive and slow-acting bait.  Then the workers you missed poisoning at first will eventually die off without replacement.  With Progs., as you say, there is no reasoning them out of their religion.  So ‘what’ (we already know that there’s no one, single ‘who’) is the analogous ‘queen’ of the Progs_?I’d say it’s the institution that replicates them, namely the ed system, most particularly, Big U.

            I agree with the fire ant analogy.  Problem is – as you said:  fire ants are predatory and expansionary.   Both of these describe current day progressives – they’re definitely predatory thru the tax structure and in numerous other ways – even though they’ll tell you that they’re not.  They’re also expansionary – as left wingers have always been.  They expand by infesting and taking over previously established institutions and societies.  They seem utterly incapable of building anything on their own.But – what they also “are” – is non reproducing.  As we can see in the current birth rates across Western nations – and in the willing importation of immigrants led by the left.  The only way to keep the religion going – is to make sure there’s somebody around to practice it when you’re gone.It’s pretty obvious that the lefties never spend much time thinking about the logical end point of their philosophy when it seems to inevitably lead to non-reproduction.At least the Nazis seemed to have their shit together on this point.  They were “nationalists” (more accurately pro-Aryan) – and they were definitely “pro-reproduction” – of Aryans.  Now if  you’re gonna have all the Aryans breeding like crazy – you need some place to put them – hence you’re gonna have to expand and get rid of the natives in the places you invade.It’s not “nice” – but it at least makes some amount of logical sense – which current age “progressives” most definitely do NOT once you fully comprehend the full picture of what they seem to “believe” in.At least the fire ants expand because they’re reproducing.  The Nazi plan was reproduce – and expand.  The current leftie progressive “plan” is what?  Abort all our kids – or simply don’t have any – spend all of our time enjoying our nice little urban theme parks – import the replacements we’re not having – and try to convince everybody black is the same as brown is the same as white is the same as male is the same as female is the same as trigender??And printing all the money to fund this crap is just fine – we’ll just suspend all the rules of finance, math, and human society to keep this whole funny farm going?Suicide cult doesn’t even begin to describe the stupidity of it all.  At least most of the suicide cults I’ve known of had an end goal for the suicide – go up to meet God or the martians or whatever.  The current day progressives can’t even seem to think that far ahead.

        I believe this may be explained by r/K theory.
Once a cause has been identified (mentioned) it instantly becomes an amygdala stimulus for all lefties. Once the amygdala is triggered they must find a release valve. And hence they all wail at (nearly) the same time, over the same issue and demand the same “solution”.
On the right side this cannot happen. Righties are pretty resistant to amygdala stimulus. There thus is no need to wail and react at the same time.

Bush was Hitler, I half-jokingly suggested bringing back flagellant processions – they could do penance for America’s sins in front of the cameras, which is all they really want anyway, and the rest of us could get on with our lives. I’m not joking anymore.

        It seems that Bicameralism never really went away in humanshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology), and that the Hive is really the portion of humanity still genetically prone to that condition and are not really fully consciousness.Jaynes hypothesizes that these bicameral humans have no conscious introspection to allow them to disobey appropriately constructed external directives, which are translated into a compelling internal hallucinatory drive. Applying this as a lens neatly explains the apparent uptake of ideas simultaneously, the relentless nature of these people, irrelevance of consequences and the profound lack of conception that their positions change even 180 degrees from one day to the next. Also the lack of interest in testing against the real world, as the only measure of truth, as in schizophrenia, is internal hallucination strength as realness.For these individuals there is no past evidence or future consequence, only the ever present now which directs their own internal command voices. The trick to control these groups is to know how to program this proto-conscious substrate within what we consider normal language.This is what propaganda through social and broadcast media has achieved so well for those who have latched onto this trick, intentionally or not.

                    ((That would mean the Sumerians weren’t completely destroyed by the “Angel with Swords of Fire” (vapor trails of the meteor strikes that pulverized Mesopotamia).Their terrible children, the surviving Habiru, simply kept on using the instinctive ticks that had served in the ancient world.They learned Narrative in fashioning an explanation for the wrath of the gods; their instinct for revision apparently reawakens much of the old wiring.))El baboso gave us the secret for understanding “bicameralism”, and/or the oppositional binary split that occurs in all societies.  Jayne and myself made the mistake of thinking it was related to the front-to-back Neanderthalic structure of occipital storage communicated through the anterior corpus.  We moderns, the children of change, use the corpus callosum, and usually in an aphasic (nonverbal) sense, what we call intuition.El baboso’s contribution was in identifying the frontal cortex as a GUI.The secret is that there are not one, but TWO, primary processing coordination centers, or GUIs- the frontal cortex, and the insula/amyglyda almond, Heartiste’s “hamster hindbrain”.Observing speech, which itself has not one, but TWO primary functions, tells us which center is dominant.Speech can be somewhat emotionally neutral, or emotionally loaded, providing an instant gut-punch of reaction and opinion.The first form is informative, frontal dominant, its function is to inform.The second, almond dominant, is emotive- its funtion is organization.Emotion, signalling loyalty, affinity, and position, is how we have organized our primate groups and hierarchies since before we could speak, or reason.  Mammalian instinct, signal systems millions of years old.This binary breakdown, variously described as guilt/shame, right/left, trad/rad, male/female, etc., reflects which of the two GUIs is dominant, affecting both  perception and reaction- which affects aggregate (group) function.Reconciliation probably isn’t possible.  War may be inevitable.

                        War is indeed the only option. You just need to look at history to see the conflict points with this part of the population.Europe (among others) has had many instances of spontaneous sect/rebellions through the ages based on  utopian doctrines/movements which somehow acts as a compelling voice for these people. It usually resulted in the deaths of many and then respite until their numbers become enough to cause trouble again.Its just another one of those, but the ideas are rapidly transmitted, more widely intentionally molded and stronger than you would get through local prophets and written pamphlets. Seems the big conscious vs non-conscious conflict is just round the corner.

                        Fascinating conversation.  Just throwing it out there, because I have no real knowledge of the subject, just observations—do people fall easily into the insula/amyglyda “almond” part of their brains for guidance, because they believe their own frontal-dominant informational self is not up to the task of competing or keeping up with the peer group they find themselves in?My take is that people of lower IQ or social skills fall more easily into a tribal/emotional mental framework when they feel that they are intellectually or socially “out of their league”.  It is their safe space when they can’t keep up.  I used to watch Obama do this all of the time, which is why I have a somewhat low opinion of his own sense of self-worth or intelligence—why he always came off, subliminally, to me at least, as a silly but angry man.

                            Jaynes suggests, and it seems very plausible to me,that here is no conscious introspection or reasoning at all in a brain like this, and that the condition is  much more like schizophrenia with an internal commanding dialogue that speaks through the person, but is not mediated by a rational mind.  Peterson touches on it when he talks about meme robots.
It is a different form of consciousnessness which you cannot apply rational models to.

        Hive behavior is an evolutionary adaption to environments in which food is abundant (think tropical jungle or vast fields of pollinating plants). Our present day affluence (and welfare policies) are the fuel that sustains and grows Progressivism. One practical way to roll this back is to change the environment. The hive mind is immune to discourse or persuasion when continued parasitism works just fine.

                “Environmentalism”  has been around for quite a while.  The true hive behavior these days is being displayed by global warming truth squad.  No matter how hard it gets beaten down thru scientific fact or thru daily reality – it just keeps turning on a dime and  coming up with another excuse.  The real problem now is that they’ve beaten their drum so loudly and for so long – that the belief in “global warming” – or “global climate change”  pretty much infests culture, society,and even business  from top to bottom.I’ve leftism compared to a death cult a number of times – well if you follow the glueball warmists far enough down their rabbit hole you WILL find all sorts of people making the arguments that major portions of humanity need to be wiped out – in order to save humanity.

            Totally agree with Drake.Spot on observation of Muslims, and of how values differ, ours meaning different things to almond thinkers- our notions seem crazy to them, as well.

        You should watch the nature program on how Japanese honey bees manage to kill giant hornets. That very well describes the exact behavior of progressives on anyone that disagrees with them; they swarm around the hornet en mass, and then raise their collective temperatures and literally cook the hornet to death. It never ends well for the hornet.

            excellent video herr Horst!   Astounding that those bees could raise their temps so close to their own limits.   I wonder if they swap in new bees, occasionally?   Maybe this technique would work with muslims?

        Hoffer is more relevant than ever…  But on the topic of pheromones/social media.  Spot on.  Locally, we’ve got all these closed Facebook groups for Town residents.   Since Trump’s election these have been infiltrated by “resisters” and transformed from “hey, who’s a good plumber” to the bat signal for the batshit crazy.  Technically these are moderated for items of local relevance, but every local issue is reframed as “social justice”.  Non-Resident kids in the school system?..racism (b/c of Trump).  Organizing for the genitalia hat marches,  Parkland protest (because you know THE existential threat to our kids is guns)..  Dare say that you think putting up a “Hate Has No Home Here” sign in front of your house is silly and you are accused of harboring Nate Forrest and Hitler under your bed.   And here his the funny part.  At least two of the ringleaders have legitimate mental illness of the medicated/prior inpatient type.  Before the election they directed the swarm onto my poor spouse who made the badthink error of saying she wouldn’t vote for Trump or Hillary because she despised both.

        Reports of the death of the socialist paradise have been greatly exaggerated. It’s taking a brief nap and will come back with new vigor to set upon new prey grown in the rows of social media cages. It’s not even sporting. The bees are not clever but the beekeeper is, and he loves his work.

        Late in the day to comment, but I’m surprised that nobody has directly addressed the parallels to ‘crowd psychology’ or ‘mob psychology’.  It seems obvious to me that we are witnessing virtual mob action.  None of the information below is new or original to me.As with everything involving psychology, the subsidiary subject of mob/crowd psychology is over-intellectualized and politicized consistent with the neurotic hang-ups of its (mostly) leftist theoreticians.  For a treatment full of the usual obfuscations and contradictions see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology.But the actual commie/collectivist practitioners of years past such as Lenin and Trotsky preferred Gustave Le Bon as a guide:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Le_BonTheir unchanging method was/is to take power using sudden mob action to weaken and (hopefully) overthrow the existing order.  They did this by creating and maintaining subversive organizations so as to be able to channelize any mob however formed, constant propaganda from those subversive organizations to cultivate favorable (i.e. unstable) conditions for mob action and finally by using (or staging) a precipitating event to create the mob once the time is judged to be auspicious.  Then the would-be leaders come out of their semi-hiding to (they hope) direct the mob towards their own objectives.  The mob itself is just an expendable means to their ends: ‘Too bad about those cossacks, but the revolution must go on and the cadre must be protected, comrade.’The politicization of the Parkland shooting is just the latest instance of how this works here and now.  The subversive organizations are locked and loaded, so to speak, the MSM being one of them now.The differences between the commies of 100 years ago and now is a lack of discipline by their would-be leaders today*, that the internet enables the subversive organizing to be done at a distance (creates the hive) and that the stinging is done via virtual mob action, (mostly) instead of street level mob action.BTW, this might explain why The Cloud was/is so terrified by the Tea Party.  It’s their own game being played back at them spontaneously.  We ought to look at and learn this lesson.________________________________* Today’s commies have *no idea* what real repression looks like.  By analogy to Lenin, Stalin, et al, Michael Moore would have spent a few years counting polar bears above the Arctic Circle, living in a drafty double-wide, instead of being a millionaire with several houses who needs to miss a lot of meals.

            The “Babylon Berlin” series currently on Netflix (1929 Berlin), shows this attempted manipulation of the crowds being attempted from a few different directions, even as the powers-that-be appear to be standing aside and just letting it all happen, for the most part.  We all know where that went.

        I’ve always referred to this crowd as liberal left-wingers but guess the new terminology is “Progressive’s”- so be it.They seem to share some traits with the Middle Eastern jihadist. The media provides a never-ending stream of propaganda and they self radicalize despite not belonging to any particular group or organization.Perfectly understandable since a lot of them share the same level of low intelligence as their middle eastern brethern.The puzzling part is speaking to Europeans with high levels of education. The hate President Trump all based entirely on liberal media.It seems acadamia no matter where in the world marches to the beat of a certain drummer. Despite never living here in the USA they all tow the party line.

        Some thoughts:This hive mind is certainly a primary default setting in the human character; but what would we call its opposite … Individualism?Is this split a foundational structure in the LEFT – RIGHT working model we’ve used to make sense of political / ideological tensions these many decades?(NOTE: I do think the actual operant distinction is now vertical, not R-L or “horizontal, though it’s convenient still to catagorize it thus to allow us to talk about the ongoing conflict.)Can there be such a thing as a “conservative” or RIGHT-wing hive, or do the requirements of personal responsibility, recognition of an Objective External Reality and a belief in the rule of law preclude this absolutely?If so, what does this mean for us politically and culturally?Is the hive-future the inevitable future for Western man?  Brings to mind Obama’s “Arc of History is long …” construct, with their end of social justice being this same, tiredbleak and tyrannical (for the masses) Western utopia.Was the American project as originally established specifically constructed to “stand athwart” this eternal tendency in man to idealism, utopianism, delusion, and oppression — AKA the long march to social justice?  (i.e., Did they know?)If so, then the great battle we face is against this implacable human force should be the primary motivator and organizational principle of all us “traditionals”, originalists, people-of-the-right, (even conservatives), or just plain “normies.”Not to fight then as appropriate to the threat is to invite our extermination ….

            My vague familiarity with the Constitution, and the civics classes I took a long, long time ago, suggest that the Founding Fathers were quite familiar with the failings of humans, and sought to disperse power and ratchet up accountability as much as was reasonably possible.  That we have utterly failed to hold up the Constitutional bargain is not their fault, but our own.

                Certainly agree.  They provided us the warning, and avenues for rectifying the problem, and the tools to get it done.  However, we have yet to work together successfully on our side to counter their near-irresistable power.  Absent organization, and an agreed-upon plan, we seem poised for extinction.  Perhaps a dash of this hive behavior would do us well ….

                Is is really wise to assume they were not at fault? The anti-Federalist dreaded the behemoth they saw germinating in Philadelphia. It took exactly seventy-two years for the Republic to change forms on a dime, to one nation, indivisible. Now pledge it after me, you fuckers: indivisible.

                    I think that they did the best they could in light of what they had just been through, and given the materials on hand.  I don’t think they could have put into place the structures needed to keep human craziness in line.There were some things that they just couldn’t foresee.  And they probably did about the best anyone could have done establishing this nation from a cold start.  It would have been nice if they could have stood up some sort of irrevocable enforcement mechanism to militate against the intractable vileness and self-interest resident in the human makeup — some thing like Gort in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 version, of course) except without the underlying socialist / progressive taint (poor attempt at humor).Unfortunately, much of what was adaptive in our nature back in remote human history is problematic now, but is here with us still, and forever, much more so than polite company would like to admit.Franklin’s warning to the woman on the Philadelphia street is instructive as to how they thought: “… if you can keep it.”  They were placing some of the responsibility for future success on us …. and we have flubbed it badly.ADDENDUM:  Of course, en external controlling entity is exactly the device sought by the LEFT, and which they are in the process of successfully implementing — Govt, and culture (one thing?) controlled by them.  Our template has been to rely on an inherent selflessness, sense of responsibility and individual self discipline in our citizenry.  Yet we’ve not done well cultivating this in the last 70 years or so.

                        They tried the Confederation first, which had a greater devolution of power to the individual states.  The “re-do”, the Constitution, dialed back the powers of the states a bit, in favor of incrementally greater power to the central government.  So they really “went for it”, back in the day, but found that a slightly less aggressive approach was necessary (or expedient) in the real world of that time, place, and culture.

        Seems like this predictable behavior against the hive.  First establish that you are a bad person — in some forum — then start making favorable comments about how reasonable some hive member is.  Light fuse and retire…

        “This innate hive-like behavior of some elements of Western society has obviously not been a detriment to progress.”
You can’t possibly know that.

            Exactly.I think there’s a very good argument to be made that the hive like behavior has been an absolute detriment to progress.  Are you trying to say that WW1 and WW2 were NOT a detriment?  What else are these orgies of destruction except exhibitions of hive like suicidal behavior?Where would be today if WW1 had not helped hugely to destroy adherence to Christianity – and WW2 hadn’t made Communism pre-eminent across a large portion of Europe – and given the lefties here in the US a god to worship?  Communism – which is another retarded baby of WW1.You don’t get a bunch of independent thinkers to march off together and blow the shit out of each other.  Washington discovered this during the Revolution when the militiamen would just leave if they didn’t like the way the campaign was going.

        What’s to be done about the hive, is there a framework for a sustainable solution?
If it’s a final solution, I would fear that my son or daughter would go through a phase of youthful indiscretion and get gassed for being associated with the hive.
How about any bees that reach the age of 35 get relocated?

        I tend to believe that the Hive response reflects their favored position with the media and other instruments of discourse and if conservatives were in a similar position they’d behave similarly.These people have a story they want to tell and the media and academia are in a symbiotic relationship with them in that public displays can be characterized as news thus justifying publicity and public displays give activists what they want in terms of message delivery.   For the Left, a protest avoided is a message undelivered.  For conservatives, public displays are rarely covered as news events so the sense of loss at avoiding a public display opportunity is lowered given that the event’s message won’t be distributed anyway.
