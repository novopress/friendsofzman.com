        Rousseau casted a spell to the modern man. He said that man was good and institutions were the cause of evil. This was a denial of original sin. Hence, to improve things, the solution must be political: change the system, through reform or revolution. Because people are good … and pigs fly.Modern people cannot think in a different way. For each social problem, people start debating political proposals. They don’t consider that the solution may be non-political. It never crosses their mind. So we have monarchists vs civil nationalists vs white nationalists vs social democrats vs woke vs comunists vs anarchists. We have debates how to change the world. We don’t want to change ourselves but we know what the world needs.But the truth is that no political system works with the wrong people, the same way a machine does not work with the wrong parts. “For every law, there is a loophole”, as it is said in Spanish.  If people are immoral, if they are radical selfish, they will twist the system to find the holes and take advantage of them.Even a bad system works well with moral people. I think socialism is bad but it worked as long as Scandinavian people were moral.John Adams said, “Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”Replace “our constitution” with “any political system”.The problem is that we don’t have a shared view of morality anymore. Christianity and tradition used to fill that hole, but now each person is its own judge: defines moral for him and he always declares himself “not guilty”.With people fighting each other to try to get from society as much as possible , not only our political system, but our culture is doomed.There is no alternative to morality. You can have a police inside each brain (conscience) but you cannot have a law officer behind each person in society.

            Every individual is good by and through himself.Vs every individual has the power to make himself good by and through himself!
It’s only slightly different than Rousseau.
The world is old and weary. It’s shweepy time!

        “… the reason that ideology must always fail, is that it never considers if the end is possible or even plausible.”“… For all of human history, how we ought to organize society was a practical question”-Very Aristotelian of you, Z.“…not a moral one.”-I have to disagree here, Z, morality was clearly central to Jewish, Christian, and Muslim societies. I don’t know a whole lot about Eastern religions but I assume they considered themselves moral people, too.“Ideology is an invention of Western man, the weeds that grew out of the rubble of the Thirty Years War.”‘Yes, ideology is a Western invention, but why? I’m not sure it grew out of the Thirty Years’ War specifically, but it certainly grew out of modernity, which is also a Western invention.What, exactly, is modernity, then? Modernity is the idea that Man can use science and reason to manipulate Nature and to defy it, as opposed to the Ancient Greco/Christian idea that man must use reason to accept Nature. (The evil Leo Strauss discusses this…)Ideology, then, is the set of ideas and values dictating why and how Modern Man ought to manipulate a now-malleable Nature, i.e. create his own reality.Love them or hate them, Hegel and Marx understood that modernity added a dialectical, progressive aspect to history, and asked what the telos of that dialectic was. Even if one rejects their answers, one cannot reject the question itself.

            Simply put, ideology is religion “without God”– that is, the attempt at a moral framework without a traditional hierarchy of authority.I argue that such a sense traditional hierarchy is instinctive; it is natural to a social primate.  In our case, this instinct has been “outverted”; loyalties, in many, are directed to an outgroup rather than one’s ingroup.  The outgroup is an imagined ideal, one can readily see the warts and flaws of one’s ingroup.The attempt at cutting the God part out was a result of the religious wars, as the Zman attests.  “Whose God?  Whose Church?” was the bloody question.  We can date the attempted answer to the Enlightenment, the Age of Reason.

-Correct. Religion argues that Man is the creation of a higher being, and the purpose of religion is for man to understand his place in the God-ordained natural order. Reality is imposed upon Man by a higher power.
Modernity is homo-centric; Man is the center of the universe, and uses science, reason and technology to manipulate nature to create a reality of his own choosing. Ideology is the narrative justifying that process.

        I have been reading “On Power” by Bertrand de Jouvenel and he argues that ideology starts with the Reformation. In the Middle Ages the kings dealt with the political, friends vs. enemies, and the Pope dealt with the moral, good vs. evil. But with the Reformation — and then the Thirty Years War — politics and religion got combined. So now we get mostly peaceful protesters blocking the Golden Gate Bridge because of the immorality of war — when the bad guys do it.

            The Guelfs and the Ghibilines predate the Thirty Years War. Before Protestantism the fundamental conflict was between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope. On the one side, the warriors. On the other, the Church.It was no accident as the Marxists say that the Church was the primary sponsor of the great artists. Michaelangelo, Bernini (his is the altar at St. Peter’s) and so on. The German Emperors, not so much.Then of course you have the Optimates and the Populares. Ideology IMHO always overlaps with class, family, and dynastic interests the latter being the strongest force in human relations.

        Ideology is the desire of whites to evade the tribalism of non-whites.
More specifically, only whites can have legitimate ideologies.  No one else.
Most non-whites literally cannot understand the words that express ideology.  They can only understand racial conflict.

        I’ll reup and recommend it again because of the substance involved. It isn’t what disgusts you (and me)–a tortured admission of sorts wrapped in an apologia is not what it is. As for the interviewer, well, that is a different matter and I wouldn’t have read it, either, if the author had been known to me beforehand.

        I’m a little confused on the definition of “ideology”. In this piece, it seems to mean something like defining a goal, an end state, and proposing a means to achieve or at least approach that state.
But by that definition, libertarianism is not an ideology. Libertarianism defines the means (non-aggression or natural rights, depending on the strain), then predicts what characteristics such a society might tend towards. It’s a lot like geometry in that regard, which is probably why so many spectrum types are drawn to it.
It just seems libertarianism should be an ideology. Am I misunderstanding your definition?

        Yarvin is Moldbug and is of a Jewish ethnicity, correct? What’s Rufo’s background? Is this another installment of “Public debates about social experiments on those wayward Gentiles?” If so, I’m all out at this point.

            Not sure of Rufo’s ancestry, but as for his posterity he has forfeited his bloodline.
I agree with you of being tired of having proxies speak on our behalf, and of other ethnos discussing our future as if we are, “interesting play toys.”
I reserve my anger for myself and for my kin for allowing ourselves to become a plaything and play to. Well said.

                Excerpted from  littoria.substack. com/p/third-worldism:As anti-Israel sentiment creeps into mainstream conservative discourse, a number of Jewish authors — some who try to interface with white radicals — have sought to counter this rising tendency with proverbial Pavlovian bell-ringing: opposition to Zionism is the agenda of “brown people,” “the woke left,” “anti-whites,” and “Third Worldism.”The Jewish figures involved in pushing various shades of this narrative include Constantin Alamariu (“Bronze Age Pervert”), Nathan Cofnas, Paul Gottfried, Curtis Yarvin (“Moldbug”), and so on. Most recently, Robert Stark, who claims to be the descendant of a prominent Zionist ideologue, begged the “alt-right” to reject the Palestinians and anti-Zionism on the grounds that taking this position is tantamount to embracing “third worldism.”Excerpted from  littoria.substack. com/p/third-worldism

        Saying Yarvin is on the right is hilarious and part of why I reject the “dissident right,” if that term even has any real meaning behind an obvious attempt to rebrand the factions from 2016 who have us the “populist” God-emperor.
Yarvin is a global technocrat to the bone, not unlike Musk. And like Musk, seemingly connected to the intelligence agencies through how he’s been promoted. His brother appears to have worked or works for intelligence.
How do you not see this stuff, Z?

            I suggest that the Z man isn’t suggesting that Yarvin is on the right, but that he is, obviously, someone being put forth to define the new right. And the people being put forth are more of the same impotence, failure and gatekeeping we’ve always gotten. Because that’s what the people doing the “putting forth” want. That’s correct.
Deep dives into “Who is Curtis Yarvin?” and “Who is behind it all?” are different topics.

                I tried to give this benefit of the doubt, but the piece accepts the basic frame: that Yarvin both has a legtimate ideology and is a monarchist (aka on the right or conservative).
Neither of these are any more true than with Musk: they are more likely state-sponsored propagandists. For other reasons, it’s important to understand this.

        Idealism may be a telos problem; but it’s not because men aim for the good as a final end. That’s just baked into beings who have an intellect and a will, operating from more than mere biological instinct and environmental conditioning. Zman hints at the real failure point when he diagnoses that ideologues rarely ask whether the end is possible. The allure of Utopia beguiled Western man long before More gave it written expression from a Renaissance humanist perspective during the liminal age between the twilight of the Medieval and the dawn of the Enlightenment.Transforming the potential (ideas) to the actual (reality) is the work of the efficient cause. And in the realm of human endeavor, the ultimate efficient cause is the power to effect change or maintain the status quo. The entire history of man reveals that power is entirely about this dynamic: sword:chicken :: wealth:egg. It is summed up in the proverbs “Them that’s got the gold rules” and “He who pays the piper calls the tune.” So, the quip about which comes first is a smoke screen. With respect to discerning human motivations, the wise have always asked “Who benefits?” and answered their own question with “Follow the money.”Pre-collapse, the vast majority can only hope to survive, adapt and occasionally throw sand in the gears of TPTB. Post-collapse, there will be chaos and localized power vacuums. Then, some will have the knowledge, skills and abilities to seize power. The best the rest can do is align themselves with a power wielder who demonstrably operates from shared values.Fallen human nature will never change. Peace is rarely achieved through anything but constant preparation for war. The utopian fantasy fails because Utopia is literally “No Place” and, thus, profoundly unrealistic. Death is, of course, the ultimate human reality. But for the Christian; it is not an end, rather a gateway. For he who believes, Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life (Via et Veritas et Vita, Jn 14:6).Here endeth the lesson.

            Life existed on Earth for about a billion years before the first sentient species arose, and natural evolution reigned supreme during that era. It has taken several tens of thousands of years, but we now have a new paradigm via the introduction of man-made evolutionary forces; of which, the tool of “money” is a relatively new invention. I will argue that we are on the cusp of another hinge-point in history in which the man-made drone is another gamechanger. Yes, the power of money has propelled many a pathogen into dominance via the corruption of natural antibodies as a Praetorian Guard of sorts. But that protective shell may not persist much longer, and if so, accountability will become a determinative thing once again.

                This proverb has long annoyed me. “All power flows from the barrel of a gun”* gropes for an idea far better expressed by one of the “bad” Roman emperors (Nero? Caligula? I forget) who supposedly said, “let them hate me so long as they fear me.”While that certainly is one way to look at this core reality of human organization called “power”, it ignores how organic societies (of family, traditions, customs, law, language) place what Z man likes to call “hard limits” on what even rulers can do, if they don’t want to be thrown into the Tiber. Reducing the norm of power relations in human history to raw force – or fear – is to accept the Leftist Point of View.*And besides, f*ck Mao. He was a fanatic and an egotist who hated his own country. Yeah, he was a brave man, a natural leader who gained power by right of conquest, but look what he did with that? Why would any dissident quote this prick as if he had some special insight different from Al Capone?

                        I guess the point I wanted to make – I am awkward in this comment environment – is that Mao was not describing power in general, but his own route to it. An aphorism for militants but hardly a useful insight into the nature of social power generally over time. Are we debating a concept or are we arming for battle?
I know what what Mao would be doing.

                        @stevew:
Mao actually was talking both about how power is/was attained and more importantly how it is retained. In a sense, this is what Andrew Jackson much earlier meant about Chief Justice Marshall one of his opinions. Any political and/or legal action only is as good as the force of arms required to carry it out.
This inability to grasp this reality is why conservatives and libertarians are utter failure.

                        @stevew, I think Mao is speaking specifically of political power. There’s very little gunplay coming from the Vatican when they change popes. Or when Walmart (and later Amazon) edged out mom &amp; pops. What are called power dynamics at the workplace rarely involve firearms.
It’s also rare in politics, though the implicit threat is always there. The praetorians are always itching to draw blood. They face little opposition because few think that today is a good day to die.

            Said it before, applies just as much. Europeans spent centuries executing anti-social hyper-violent types. If you couldn’t behave, the gallows or stake ended your bloodline, and cleaned up our gene pool.Africa never did. They just captured their excess population and sold them off as agricultural equipment. I suspect they probably can clean up their bloodlines, as IKAGO suggests, but there may be no shortcut. Until the bloodlines are cleaned up, though, I see no way they can be a part of European-based societies. Go back to Africa and clean up your gene pool. I’ll even send some rope to get you started.

        Rufo has had small victories. Yarvin has not even had that. But neither address the real issues at hand. The Coalition of the Ascendant is now coming apart, and the only way to create unity among groups that hate each other: (((Wall Street Managers))) and BLM grifters and Muslims, is the mutual hatred and Young Turk solution to the modern Armenians. Us.And even Rufo’s “victories” are pointless — USF has simply renamed their DEI admins and programs. No one got fired, and the policies remain the same just different names.It seems quite clear the coming “solution” to the Coalition of the Ascendant (not fringes — normal White guys are the “fringe” sorry Sailer) — is going to be something along the lines of the late Ottoman Empire. Turks and Arabs alike found someone to hate. The same way Katherine Maher of NPR and Ilhan Omar can bond over their mutual hatred of YT. And that certainly seems to be an ideology.Its a simple one. But the very simplicity of hate YT is what makes it so effective as the glue holding the Ruling Coalition together.

            Agreed. Which is why of all the movements, counter-movements, media darling, dissidents, useful idiots, and Rufo’s the only that is explicitly and implicitly verboten is YT identity. In the positive as in PRO YT for YT interest alone. Sailerism is tolerated because it only points out the failing of others without elevating YT, Rufo can get his little ‘wins’ because at it’s heart his argument still lives in the warm glow of tabula rasa and denial of biology, and every flavor of identity can have have their “lives matter”/”day of visibility”/”power” to chip away at culture.

                I really don’t know why anyone believes this.  Even if there was no natural mechanism to prevent this, the state could always outlaw birth control.  I reckon we’re going to see this in China if their pronatalist policies fail to raise birth rates.  They will do it first because they don’t even pretend they care what the mass of people think.

                    Easiest way to address a bunch of these problems in one fell swoop is to retain something like Social Security, but base the benefits not on the taxes you paid in, but on the taxes your children pay in. It is greatly to your benefit to have lots of highly productive kids. If you also reduce benefits by the amount the net parasites you raised cost society…
Sooner or later, it will dawn on people that this is just reinventing the multi-generational family, but with a middleman skimming his 10%. At which time, we can easily dispense with the middleman.

                        This.  If you raise three or more children to the age of majority and they become tax payers not tax consumers, you shouldn’t have to pay a dime in taxes for the rest of your life.
The failed experiment has been to use massive migration to solve the demographic problem.  But massive migration is creating the perfect conditions for societal collapse.
The only other option is to promote childbearing.

                    I think the fertility crisis is bigger than the state, and human organizations are powerless to do anything effective about it.It’s not any one thing — not just “birth control” — and the people in charge don’t even know all the factors, nor how to address them, especially in this time period when peoples’ trust in and allegiance to their governments is at record lows.The folks in charge waited about two generations too long to address the problem — now the people starting to be in charge are the Beautiful Ones from Calhoun’s rat Utopia and they’re so deeply enmeshed in the problem they can’t even begin to see it clearly.

                    Don’t know why you got a down vote. Australia opened it’s immigration to the world after the 1970’s. It’s got a huge mix of population, as America does. It’s the stabbing of an Assyrian (off brand) Eastern Orthodox Bishop who is on TikTok. My guess is he was probably saying dumb things about ME Muslims, also in Australia.The English simply don’t do these sorts of things. We do get stuck with vibrant diversity problems however.

        To beat a dead horse.What persists is what “works” in a particular environment. Society evolves like every other living thing, and the traits that become dominant in a particular society (over a long time frame) are those that have organically proven to work for the inhabitants in that locale. There is no “striving” for an ideal, so promoting an abstract ideology is simply attempting to play God and impose a man-made alternative to natural evolution. As such, there is no “one size fits all.”There is, however, societal disease (again, just like every other living thing). Viruses, pathogens, parasites can (and do) invade a healthy host and attempt to either feed off of it or dominate it. When that happens, nature has a cure that has been proven over a span of about a billion years. The pathogens must go, and it is the duty of antibodies to accomplish that task or the host dies. It really is that simple.

                One of the tragic downsides to having a complex brain capable of abstract thought is the vulnerability to propaganda.  For simpler creatures if you want to kill them, you have to actively do it yourself. Man, however, can be talked into destroying himself.
This is another aspect of what Z calls ideology. Dogs and cats don’t genocide each other with visions of some perfect dogtopia in their heads.

                “It’s really ironic to me that we can see what is needed because we have ton of examples in nature and yet we continue to narrate our own genocide…Boggles the mind…”The “problems” that “we” have are those of people who are too rich, too secure, too well-fed, and who have way too much time on their hands.Life *requires* adversity not only to make it meaningful, but quite simply to keep it from degenerating into what we live with today. Without *natural* adversity, people will generate adversity in the form of the various “problems” that everybody is always yammering about, and all the crackpot “causes” in which a materially comfortable and safe population abounds.Generations of material prosperity and comfort, coupled with the lack of “natural” adversity is perforce corrosive of the human organism. It requires extraordinary “resistance” to avoid falling into the multiplicity of individual and societal pathologies wrought by decades of ease and comfort. It needs a very rare strength of character to resist the moral and spiritual corruption wrought by long periods of material prosperity.IMO, that is what we are living through–the result of generations of material prosperity and ease and comfort.When people cease to be too rich, too secure, too sell-fed and to have too much tie on their hands, we’ll see a great many changes. It will be a rough ride but, ultimately, it must redound to the general welfare.The human organism *requires* adversity and challenge just to avoid becoming degenerate.

        Off-topic, so I apologize. But speaking of rightwing pundits/commenters/activists; what happened to this Richard Spencer fellow?
I watched a video of him the other day being interviewed by black Guardian journalist Gary Younge. Spencer said some of the most offensive things one can imagine – so seemed under no illusions of the race issue. He really went in all guns blazing, as far as I could see.
My understanding is that he has since “mellowed” or “sold out” – but that is what I picked up from this blog, one of the five websites I read, so forgive my ignorance.

            Can you provide a link to it?  I think I actually recall such an interview Spencer did some years ago.I don’t think Spencer was ever any good for DR or what was called Alt-Right politics 8 years ago.  He is a total screw up besides.  Some of the things he’s done are so retarded that you have to conclude he was working for the enemy.  For example, his supporters all got doxed by someone he allowed to have access to his member database.  Then, after that doxing, he stated he would be willing to give this same doxer a “2nd chance” if it seemed sincere to him. This is just one example of many screw-ups he has had.

                This is the one. Admittedly, it popped up as I was just finishing a Jared Taylor lecture:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puJ-arJgkZU
I’d never heard Mr. Spencer speak before, but what he was saying (don’t know if he believed it), was quite blunt, and delivered in an almost mocking and pitying tone. Particularly at the end when Mr. Younge reasoned that if blacks hadn’t been taken as slaves from Africa, it would have been much better; Spencer’s look and blunt reaction are priceless.

            A couple of years ago Spencer gave up on the immigration issue because he believes it’s over, there’s nothing that can be done, demographic change is baked in the cake, etc.
As for other issues, I don’t know, I gave up on taking him seriously since there’s been a pattern of being a contrarian in order to, in my opinion, shock or get attention.  There’s also a pattern of Spencer burning bridges with those who have collaborated with him.  I think it’s best to ignore him.

            Spencer was in an interesting talk with “Millennial Woes,” in the latter’s series of Milleniyule podcasts around the end of last year.  Spencer was kind of all over the place.  He showed the charm that he’s capable of, and he’s clearly a bright guy, but I wouldn’t say he inspired confidence with some of his judgments, both in that podcast and in his previous actions.  The Milleniyule talk is worth watching/listening to, though.  Enjoyable, if you can still stand the sight and sound of Spencer.

        I admit that I fell into the trap when I was younger, but in hindsighted amuses me that they tried to reduce conservative into something like a ten commandments of life. You know, stuff like “thou shalt not have high taxes,” “thou shalt support Israel,” and other such catechisms.You’re right about people trying to field these new right conservative superstars, but as far as I’m concerned most of them are scum. You might as well follow Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. They are arguably more interesting than MTG, “groypers” and Lauren Boebert parading around her multi-generational family of ferals. I find nothing attractive about people in the food stamp crowd rising up to be my supposed intellectual leaders.

            But what about the DR? I’m not saying there should be some sort of a priori catechism for a DR policy platform, but we can certainly descry traits and stances that are common on the DR and are even perhaps necessary. The difference, I suppose, is between prescription and description. But once you describe are you prescribing?

            ” … they tried to reduce conservative into something like a ten commandments of life. You know, stuff like “thou shalt not have high taxes,” “thou shalt support Israel,” and other such catechisms.”Very well stated. You have gone right to the heart of the matter; to the Truth.For there is no such thing as conservative ideology, nor can there be. Ideology and conservatism are mutually exclusive, for the conservative lives life without reference to ideology. His grounding is in received custom and tradition, to which he gives little, if any, “thought.” His bedrock values are stability, continuity, tradition, blood, and soil. These to him are as the air her breathes. It is his largely unconscious nature, not an “ideology.”He may give conscious thought to these things if they are threatened, in which case he may become a reactionary. At such a crossroads, he will likely take definite action against “innovations” and those who seek to realise them.But ideology? Never. Impossible. It is wholly outside the nature of a conservative. Nature, not ideology. That is conservatism. Anything else is counterfeit.

        As soon as you accept biological reality, most arguments about how we ought to live become superstitionYes – I agree one-hundred percent.However, as we all know here, infighting and disagreement become far less of a problem in a racially similar society. That’s not to say that whites don’t have various forms of factionalism and fighting; it’s just that they are not so great a barrier toa functioning society overall. We’re finding out, all of us first hand, what it’s like with 60% percent white, 10% musselman, 20% black and Heaven knows what else. Not good at all, and it’ll get worse, I believe.Z, I know you were referencing trannies in this context, but it links up with the race stuff as well. We simplycannotlive side-by-side with people who believe in this stuff, believe in equality across the board; not to mention other races/cultures. There seems to be a hard limit on the extremities that a society can accommodate before it begins to disintegrate.And, from a cultural perspective, that is exactly how I’d define what we’re living through: a disintegration… with the FedGov rapidly applying Gorilla Glue to all the emerging cracks.

            “We simply cannot live side-by-side with people who believe in this stuff, believe in equality across the board; not to mention other races/cultures.”Sadly, it’s even worse than that.  They preach equality, but they don’t mean it.  What they want and impose is White inferiority.  When team brown can win, like in certain sports, that’s just meritocracy.  But when they can’t win, it’s because we’re cheating and need to crushed and humiliated.Same with the trannies and homos.  This is why they love pushing the whole bearded man in a dress or people like “Kerry/Kayla Lemieux.”  They want us to be forced to humiliate ourselves and play along with such obvious lies. To be forced to tell such obvious lies in the face of truth eats at our soul and makes us less able to resist and that’s why they do it.

Dalrymple went on to say that the purpose is not to convince but to humiliate. If you can oblige somebody to parrot lies, you humiliate them, making them, as you say, easy marks.” … and that’s why they do it.”Many of them, yes, no doubt. But I suspect that most do it b/c they actually believe the nonsense they hear and imitate, insofar as they are capable as anything as honest as belief. Most of them are just stupid. Just stupid.And if the fashion changed tomorrow, they would abandon today’s vogue post-haste and think nothing about it. They are cattle, and cattle are notoriously stupid. That’s why so many people can be accurately labeled “bovine.”

        For “Rufoism” to have any chance of success, the Supreme Court would have to overturn part or all of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and restore at least the private freedom of association. Some serious people think that’s what Gorsuch is aiming at, but it’s hard to imagine Roberts or ACB going along.
Even if they did, the regime would no doubt respond as they have with Dodd, and do everything in their power to undermine the decision, but it’s an interesting thought experiment.

            They would have to overturn Brown as well. Frankly, I think you would need to remove the Reconstruction amendments. If it is possible to do that, then it is possible to start from a blank sheet of paper and not try to patch up what turned out to be a failed experiment.

                Rufo suffers from the same incorrect assumption that every colorblind CivNat starts with: he just assumes that other races think like he does.When I occasionally tweak the Sailer crowd, I ask them that very question. What if other races don’t want a colorblind society? What if they find it immoral?Rufo, Anton and Sailer types just assume that other groups will want what maybe a slight majority of white men (but not white women) want. They really believe the natural in natural rights.Heck, even the victory over AA in colleges was Asians complaining about being discriminated against. They didn’t care about whites.Hey, Rufo, what if other groups don’t want a colorblind society? What then?Also, the CivNat crowd loves Rufo’s practical victories, but those “victories” – such as they are – have a couple of problems. First, they’re victories over freedom of association, which the colorblind CivNat crowd doesn’t seem to be on friendly terms with. Second, do they really move the needle toward their colorblind utopia? Are Indians going to stop hiring their cousins whatever the law says? Not likely.Rufo and Sailer types like to present themselves as the practical warriors. “Hey, it’s a multi-everything society, so how do we best make it work for everyone, including whites” is their mantra. But they refuse to consider the freedom of association route or the whites joining the identity politics route and focus solely on the colorblind route.I’d suspect that Rufo, Sailer, Murray, etc., understand that what keeps this society together is whites not joining the identity politics game or going down the freedom of association route. It’s why they seem to fear it more than anything.

                Z —Correct that ideology is d-e-d.  This is a religious war.But failed experiment?  I see neither experiment nor failure.Race Grievance Industry, institutionalized and dominant Feminism, homo and tranny celebrationism, open borders etc. . . . all of these elements were quite intentionally created and seeded-in incrementally to the population, with a desired result based on long-settled mass-behaviorism.Human behavior at the collective level is, sadly, predictable and manipulable.  The mass-com age provided the platforms.As for ‘failure’, the Project has been a massive success across the anglo, and western, worlds.  With deep inroads into the East.New Amerika is not the result of well-intentioned men and their successors managing an experiment in humanity, then hopefully waiting for sweetfruit results.  It is the construction of their Perfect Daemonium, their New Atlantis, utterly intentional and, to date, wildly successful.

Bingo! It does viloence to the very meaning and etymology of the word “nation,” which is derived from the Latin “natus” meaning “to be born.”  A nation *by definition* is a people related by blood. How can there be a nation of ideas or a “proposition nation.”
Who would are to suggest that “the Navajo Nation” could be founded on a proposition? Can you imagine the wailing and gnashing of teeth!?
It’s nonsense.Just like nearly everything nowadays.

Once on the bench, he extended civil rights law to apply to trannies and acknowledge it was not part of the law.

                The experiment succeeded right up to the War. Messily, as any sophisticated understanding would predict. But the central government was denied the power it would need to accomplish everything it did accomplish in the following 159 years.Suffrage was limited to white men and it excluded many of those as well. Suffrrage advanced from less than half of white man to, by the War, 100% of white men. In 1920 followed the deluge.My Frenchman wrote that universal suffrage was the bane of democracy even before women were a factor, and not only was it a “detesable element of government” but worse, a  “revolutionary instrument.”“The unity, the universality, the omnipotence of society’s power, and the uniformity of its rules represent the outstanding feature of all the political systems invented in our day. They recur at the heart of the strangest utopias. The human mind still pursues these images even in its dreams.”You cannot legislate yourself out of that.

        Ideology is borne from K-selected peoples. I’m trying to think of which peoples have created philosophies and ideologies and then tried their hardest to graft it onto the world’s other peoples?*Definitely European Man (later including Russian Man and Ashkenazi Man). They created the fires from which the world is now burning.*East Asian Man to a lesser extent. They have philosphies but not ideologies so much, they import ideologues, and they took to Democracy and then Marxism with gusto. Others like South Korea and Taiwan do Liberalism very well.*Indian Man? They started Buddhism and all sorts of hippie-dippie crap, which White Man then takes to with gusto.

Hardly are those words outWhen a vast image out of Spiritus MundiTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desertA shape with lion body and the head of a man,A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,Is moving its slow thighs, while all about itReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.The darkness drops again; but now I knowThat twenty centuries of stony sleepWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

            If you think about it, the system they put in place could have changed into whatever the people felt appropriate, as long as it was those people making the decision. Like, the Seeds of Albion could have passed a Constitutional Amendment to abolish the Constitution but it was based on the assumption that they knew what they were doing (and this was also what they themselves did by moving from the Articles to the Constitution). Instead we got the inverse, where a bunch of tyrants, degenerates, and lunatics took over the system, kept the trappings of it, but changed everything underneath. The Supreme Court might be a well-designed institution, but it can’t function with people like Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor running it, even if they go through all the pomp and circumstance.

                “ The Supreme Court might be a well-designed institution, but it can’t function with people like Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor running it,…”The above seems like an oxymoron.  How can a well designed institution accept such political mediocrities and be called “well designed”.  I maintain that the SCOTUS was ill-designed as it assumed something not in evidence—that members would be “apolitical” and that all would have a higher allegiance to the Constitution rather than to a political ideology.  In short it failed to account for the weaknesses of man.I have no solution myself, and do not particularly fault the Founders.  It may indeed be impossible to develop an institution run by man that is free of such weaknesses.

                    Marbury v. Madison. SCOTUS wasn’t intended to deal with constitutionality of laws.
The Constitution is an expression of the spirit of the people. Says as much in the preamble. That got turned backwards pretty quickly. If you can fault the Framers, it’s for that. Ideas, not people.

                        I tend to think that the Founders did not recognize the danger that the fairly undefined power of the Supreme Court could be when usurped by a raging partisan idealogue such as Chief Justice Marshall.
Perhaps the Founders were influenced by the unwritten constitution of Great Britain, and failed to grasp that a written constitution would be susceptible to Marshall’s naked power grab in ways  not to be seen in that unwritten constitution with which they were familiar.

                        Yep, that’s probably true, but even writing down the rules implies a step away from spirit. They were coming out of the Anglo tradition, and maybe it was seen as necessary to make things explicit in the absence of tradition, but it ended up being a change in direction, and I doubt they could’ve been completely aware of it.

            “Revolutionary America was organized around ideology.”Wellll … I don’t think I can go along with that although I do know what you mean by it. And Puritan New England very likely believed in the ideology stuff. But the plantation South?JEfferson’s text in the Declaration was a very conscious propaganda effort of a country already at war. They wanted–had to have–French support, and the Committee knew that Jefferson could write the kind of BS that was trendy in France at that time.And it worked like a charm.But Ben Franklin wrote, years after independence, that the *real* reason for the Independence movement and the war itself was that the British Ministry steadfastly refused to allow the Americans to issue their own currency. It would have been a wrench in the machinery of the British policy of mercantilism. They couldn’t allow British America to issue their own currency.The “ideology” business was wartime propaganda to draw in a powerful ally so as to win the real prize: issuing their own currency. Said Mr Franklin. And he probably knew what he was talking about.The “ideology” of “liberty” specifically meant the liberty to take control of money and commerce away from the British Ministry.

        “The problem with this, the reason that ideology must always fail, is that it never considers if the end is possible or even plausible.”It’s in the nature of the ideal. Timeless, universal, uncorrupted, not in this world, not ultimately compatible with it.“Ideology is an invention of Western man, the weeds that grew out of the rubble of the Thirty Years War.”The loss of religion, which is the loss of spirit, or will. This takes a long time, but you’re left with the critical ideal (because you’ll always fall short of it), and the desires of the flesh. You’ve lost your cause, the thing that elevates life and mysteriously makes it work. Just a machine or an animal running its course. Missing something, even lying to yourself and others about it— that’s why these things don’t work.

        It seems to me that the organization of all societies is based on both the practical and moral – at least in the sense of right and wrong.  I guess the practical is always evolving, hopefully for the betterment of society, while the moral should be stable over time – which is not what we have now.  The moral has evolved (and practical devolved) into a freak show which is tearing our society apart.

            usNthem,That’s a good way to put it.A 50 year old man abducting a schoolgirl will always be wrong. Lying and cunning will always be wrong. Stealing a watch from a jewellers will always be wrong… Well, except in Clown World.It is the moral foundation that has begun disintegrating, and the loss of Christ from our hearts must surely explain it to a large degree.One thing I tell people often, when they tell me that our society has progressed, is:No. Our technology has progressed. In every other measure we’re likely worse.This statement seems so obvious to me, as to not need repeating… but there you go.

                Indeed. Progress is a chimera. And even our undoubted advances in medical science and technology have begotten multifarious other unanticipated problems that largely cancel out the gains. Are whites actually happier in 2024 than we were in 1524? We certainly live longer, but I’m by no means certain we’re happier.

                    All civilizations that are advancing leave the seeds for their decline. The Greeks declined rapidy. Perhaps the Romans lasted so long because they stopped advancing after inventing property law and concrete, while carrying letters as a numerical system throughout. The Chinese were like that. The Renaissance broke that mold but even there we are experiencing its seeds of decline.

        We now have the answer to James Madison’s question in Federalist Paper #1: “whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from ref[l]ection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.”We *are* capable of establishing good government, but only when circumstances of accident and force support that goal. Otherwise, we regress to a state of barbarism or savagery, whose level depends on the history, culture, and biological traits of the populations involved.However, that doesn’t mean we are completely helpless. Occasionally, the stars *do* align in favor of a good society — what Ludwig Von Mises called “the free and prosperous commonwealth.” When that happens, we need to keep the ideal state in mind so that we know what to do, and what *not* to do, in order to achieve it.

                The problem is essential the fallacy of equality.  Race not withstanding.  Seems the more we believe such nonsense, the more we seek to destroy our “betters”. As they remind us of this reality and our own inabilities/mediocrity.
We no longer celebrate our good fortune in having such people among us.  We no longer promote and elevate them.  We no longer follow and allow them to guide us.  Indeed, we elevate just the opposite people to rule over us.  We “cut off our nose to spite our face”.

        Great post Z. As Plato showed 2500 years ago, no government type is stable in the long run, and is destined to evolve. There’s no “right” way to organize society, and when societies get reorganized, it is largely to address the wrongs of the system they are revolting against, with a secondary concern being how well will that system address the unknown unknowns. A good system is adaptable (and perhaps this why monarchies stuck around for so long – a monarch can change his mind based on practical concerns!), but even then, at some point it ceases to be the original system. The Founding Fathers put an adaptable system into place, but we don’t have the system they set up. They discussed that in the Federalist Papers but in a very real sense, it’s “cross your fingers and hope they stay sane and figure it out” stuff (spoiler: we did neither).Ideologies are not adaptable or flexible. When they run up against reality, such as biological reality, it can only resolve the tension by imposing force. Which is what it is doing now. Germany’s talk of banning AfD in order to “save democracy” is a great example of this.

            This is negation by conflation. Conflating the descriptive with the prescriptive is a way of dealing with Hume’s guillotine by declaring that there are no truly descriptive statements. The ID’ers love doing this by declaring “Darwinism” a form of religion. Hume’s guillotine remains undefeated, however, because non-contextual reality must exist for us to exist, unless one is prepared to argue that we are a figment of our own imagination.

                Samuel Johnson: I refute it thus.Though, to be fair, I would say that that the moment you start creating umbrella categories such as “biological reality,” you have introduced, inductively and implicitly, conclusions about the essence of those things beyond the descriptive components. I am not expert on Hume, but I believe this touches on his fallacy or whatever of uniformity of nature.But, to be fair, again, who wants to live near diversity?I refute it thus 🙂

            Was there really a long march to tranny teachers sneaking hormones into the kids, or was it accomplished instantly—underlings swarming on command to manifest the will of one pervert, our king, or a few, our royalty?Your sense while it was happening is that it happened suddenly, right? There wasn’t much “while it was happening.” There was something like an autocratic decision made somewhere, then quickly implemented and harshly enforced everywhere. One day trannies are the weirdest sex maniacs, rare even in fetish pornography, and the next they’re our masters, in charge of the nation’s child raising and moral uplift (says the president), and if you complain about it Southern cops will beat you on TV.We like lineage. It’s conservative. “It all goes back to Plato…” But what if the analogy of ideas to genes is false? Or maybe there are no ideas at all, only types of people, and they do what’s possible—the most sadistic thing possible, usually.

                    The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert came out in 1994. Too Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar in 1995. The latter the one where Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo portrayed drag queens. I dunno if those were aimed at children, but I’m certain they weren’t hidden from children. The latter rated PG 13.
Of course Victor/Victoria was a dozen years earlier. Around the same time as Tootsie, which broached the topic more deceptively.

                Simplify, please.  I realize there is a butt-ton behind the ‘why’, the driving ideology, but the practical matter is that Tranny, Inc. is a marketing campaign for Teva Pharma in Israel*, and the fact that Michelle is a man.
*The clinics, having gone from 3 to 2500 in a few years as profit-making centers for Teva, the only maker of gender transition drugs.  This is a shiny new thing like wind turbines or Prohibition.

                    Teva is not the only manufacturer of transition drugs. They are only one of several companies making generic versions of standard hormone replacement therapies, which have been around for ages to treat menopause (m-&gt;f) or “legal” performance enhancing drugs (f-&gt;m).
They may have something new; I don’t know. My PDR is the last printed edition, from 2017. Trans Inc predates 2017, though…

                Most utopian schemes I’ve looked into share the same fault. They think the means they desire will bring about the end that they desire just because they are good people or something.
I think you can either define a movement by means (Golden rule, for example), or maybe an end state (judging from history, usually some kumbayah crap) but you don’t get to select both end and means except for some very special cases.

        The interview with Granza is interesting. He seems to have nearly crossed the great divide but isn’t sure if he wants to come ashore. However, from what he says, I’d be pretty damn surprised if he hadn’t read Z.As to Z’s post, it clarifies again that we are no longer a people. Indeed, the entire West has lost that foundation, which is why ideology takes center stage. When you are a people, how to run society focuses on practical matters.It’s no different than a person who knows himself. If you feel comfortable with who you are, you spend your life trying to improve your day-to-day life. If you aren’t comfortable with yourself, you go in search of meaning.Since Americans are no longer a people, we need ideology to fill the moral void, to create cohesion and to give direction. This is why our politicians bicker endlessly about ideological differences instead of practical issues such as infrastructure.But as Granza notes, people long for a sense of belonging, an attachment to land and culture. (But he doesn’t quite get that culture is downstream from biology – or, at least, he doesn’t admit it.) This is why ideology as the foundation of a country will fail. Ultimately, what we want is a people, a family with shared ancestry, culture, religion and language.Neither the Left nor the Right offer this. The Left offers a multi-everything bazaar where no one feels at home – except the one group that thrives in such an environment. The Right offers an efficient tax code and corporatism where you’re treated as an interchangeable widget.The Age of Ideology will give way (return, really) to the Age of Demographics because the Age of Ideology was always unnatural and immoral.

                    “Publicly.” Reading between the lines, Granza already has arrived. He touches on biological realities several times with his discussion of mass migration and acknowledgement the people Adams said were necessary for the system he created were more than simply churchgoers. Claremont funding and Dreher interviews are not possible in the present environment when someone rings the bell after walking up to it. Even the walking part was vilified not so long ago, so the open discussion is moving in the right direction.

            The distintion between ‘religion’ and ‘ideology’ that the Zman is making is this:  the Enlightenment attempt to get away from the wars of religion.  Even the Buddhist wars were genocidal.
Thus, the Age of Reason.  Taking out an instinctive hierarchy of authority– that is, “for God, King, and Country”, what the religious refer to as “we lost God!”, a natural understanding of order in one’s personal perspective– led to the scramble of ‘every man for himself’ in the opportunism of modern democracy, equality, and capitalism.

A potential outcome is these ongoing revolutions enable a ruthlessly realistic, managerial approach to human affairs.

        Biological determinism will be denied until the day it cannot be. The door to putting an end to this avoidance may have been opened, ironically enough, by the Left’s claim that “whiteness” more or less is a genetic defect much like a predisposition toward disease. If “whiteness” is biologically predetermined, what else is? Everything, of course. Yes, the power centers will try to contain the principle but is that possible? Expansive discussion of the concept has been pushed underground about as long as possible. This move beyond radical equalitarianism toward what is in effect an argument for extermination and genocide lays bare the only actual organizing principle. It is terrifying but clarifying to be on the receiving end.Ideology is reality avoidance presented as an intellectual exercise. Ideas and proposition nations never substituted for tribes and blood and soil. As you have pointed out, reality is the thing that does not go away once you no longer believe in it. Racial headcounts are all that matter. The open border is an acknowledgement of this, and the ethnic cleansing underway in Gaza represents the only political reality that ever has mattered.Those in charge are evil but they are at least honest.

            It is remarkable (also unexpected and ironic) that in just the last 5 years or so, the “left” has done more to promote biological determinism, and also “antisemitism,” and bring them into the mainstream, than anyone else has in a very long time. The recent growth of the DR is far more due to them than to its own efforts. The “colorblind” society persisted as long as it did, and fooled as many civnats as it did, because the left played along with it. Now that they’ve stopped playing, the only question is why any civnats still do.

                Recep Erdogan: “(D)emocracy is like a train; you get off once you have reached your [real] destination.”CivNats take all of their cues, and I do mean all, from the Left. Even their positions in alleged opposition are the moral leftist framework. Now that their directors have told the white ones that they are evil, I suspect those who do not wake up, which will be the majority, will embrace the idea. The Conservative Case for White Genocide is waiting to happen.I don’t really buy that our enemies are destroying themselves, at least as of now, but they no longer are hiding who they are, either. You are right in that by drawing the lines so clearly they have made the stakes undeniable. Separation is happening as a direct result.

            Jack:  “Ideology is reality avoidance presented as an intellectual exercise.”Excellently put.  Just another credentialed way to avoid reality.   And why I cannot find the desire to read today’s links.  Claremont – founded by Jew Harry Jaffa and pushing ‘natural rights.’  Yarvin – a strange looking and sounding Jew with an obsessive following.  Rufo – a cuckservatard married to a Thai who believes the system can be fixed, piecemeal, via lawfare.  And they all claim to be the champions of Western Civilization.I am so, so over all these mental masturbators.  Either one accepts the reality and highly-predictive nature of genetics, or one pushes pet theories.  I will not waste my time reading those who push their magic theories, and I do not respect anyone who is a ‘follower’ and champions their guy and his favorite magic theory.  No matter how late the hour or how dire the circumstances, there will always be some self-proclaimed super secret smart guy who will say “Wait, Wait!  I know THE answer!  My idea will fix everything!”FOAD.

                    Jack:  Appreciate the recommendation, but avoiding it is – in a way – the whole point of my comment.  I’m just not interested in yet one more account of how some guy is finally, tortuously, figuring out racial reality.  One more tale of “Oh, yeah.  I guess the theories don’t comport with reality.”I am very far past all that, and just no longer find it of interest.  People who get it, and alter their choices and lives to better align with reality – are generally busy doing – not debating.  I understand the point of Zman’s posts are to explain and elucidate for so many who endless fall back on unthinking, learned, liberal assumptions.  I have no need of the reminders and those who champion their special guy who best aligns with their personal preferences.  It’s just another filter between them and hard reality.  So very tiresome.

                        I’ll reup and recommend it again because of the substance involved. It isn’t what disgusts you (and me)–a tortured admission of sorts wrapped in an apologia is not what it is. As for the interviewer, well, that is a different matter and I wouldn’t have read it, either, if the author had been known to me beforehand.

        As I read this something memories of um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um Yarvin came to me. His analogy of the Monarch is the CEO. The CEO is the monarch. In other words, Yarvin is a quintessential managerialist and mercantilist.A CEO is not a monarch. He is a manager with an extremely narrow view – pursuing the well-being of his business and maximizing profits and product quality. He considers nothing else. This is why a mercantilist society is doomed. Its most powerful people may end up spending and bending all of their energy and wealth destroying the society since their mission is to enrich the company.Yarvin is proposing to defeat Managerialism with Hyper-Managerialism.In 5-7 years, the tech bros like Solana and Andreeson … … are going to be using our talking points because theirs are just doubling down on failure. We just didn’t really try mercantile capitalism they believe. I say this as a reformed minarchist libertarian. It is a guaranteed failure of an ideology.The question is, will they be begging us to rule over them. Dont’ count on it. The future will be owned by those to do what it takes to rule over the society – that includes the thing about aristocracy that Yarvin the consummate bugman does not understand. The aristocrat is in service to strengthening all columns of The Order not a tiny slice of it. The new aristocracy will go and tell Solana and Andreeson how it is going to be. We are a long way from that, but we will get there.

                    I intuitively suspect that you are right. But one should not forget that both Napoleonic France and the third Reich were only a few avoided mistakes (and less robust Russian adversaries) away from being far more permanent than they turned out to be. Contingencies do matter

Let us agree, rather, that princes are not made famous anymore. One does not see princes on TeeVee or in People Magazine. But we do still make them. They are out there.

            that we have government promoting this “public private partnership” (PPP) b.s. is a fairly obvious example of idiocracy. We have to suffer the indignity of Barnum statements like that and “defending our democracy” .The “Public” in PPP  does not represent the voter (whatever that means nowadays) but the hijacked globohomo government.Democracy, as we all know, is just sodomy.The very idea of just leaving people alone will never occur to them, If something is good and also not theirs, it must be taken or destroyed.

            Lest anyone forget, or never knew, Yarvin was an enthusiastic proponent of Seasteading. Its members have the admirable need to divorce themselves from the madness of the world that rules us, which is an exellent cause, and absolutely not one particle of practical awareness.

        Well I think the way forward may lie in the past. One of the bloggers (might have been Z) said that Rome bounced between tyrants and democracy as the situation dictated.Power and money corrupt. When your leader or leaders stop working, they are killed and swept aside. Human nature is what it is. If you allow greed and corruption to take hold in your leadership, and the people being governed are apathetic…no system or ideology is going to hold.There’s nothing new under the sun. The American Empire’s problems are “people” problems. Nothing will change until our leaders are held accountable.

        Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, English and Franks didn’t posses an equivalent to modern universities. Those matriculated were indoctrinated   by ideologues with ideologies acceptable to the state. Ideologies became new religions that supplanted the old ones and molded the public eventually so it no longer had faith or common sense.
