        Poor people have lots of kids because the government lends a generous hand. Wealthy and educated people have one or two kids because everything is so damn expensive and the future is murky. The $250k cost figure is scary but what is also scary is hearing that a college grad today will have 12 to 15 jobs over their lifetime. That is a lot of uncertainty.

        Society as a whole may not be having many kids, but certain segments of society are having plenty.  It is these people, and their descendents, who will own the future.  Prepare for a world with lots of Mexicans and Mormons.

        The next great step forward will actually be a step backward. Man’s ideal circumstance is that of agriculture. The amount of mental illness and unhappiness in the western world is due to lack of connection to the soil.Young Europeans and East Asians won’t have children because of the massive uncertainty the future holds when it comes to raising them. We’ve all heard the figures, every year they sound more ridiculous. I think it now costs $250,000 to raise a child until it is 20 years old. So that’s half a milly for Katie and Billie.Imagine however, that you knew Katie and Billie would always have enough to eat, would always be fully-clothed and sheltered and would be working from the age of 12 or 13. This is where the return to agriculture comes in.People only need work 25-30 hours a week and modern farming isn’t exactly the back-breaking drudgery it used to be. Cottage industries like clothing, shoe making, pottery and wood turning provide for the tangible goods we need. The advances in aqua/hydroponics along with solar power means a big backyard could supply what a medium sized farm previously could with about one-tenth of the resources.It may sound a bit Pol Pot but it really could work. No more soul-draining commute, staring at a computer for hours on end, worrying about the bitch from human-resources deciding your family’s fortunes or losing 50 hours of your week shuffling papers for people who don’t care if you live or die.If you offered jobs for life for people to pick corn and cucumbers 25 hours a week, I think you would get a line around the block. People lack confidence in the current system, they hate being a slave to a master they can’t see all the while pouring half their pay into a corrupt and soulless government.We yearn for security, for leisure time to improve ourselves and a promise for future generations.

        […] from Trump. Strangely, the establishmentarians think Trump offends women as much as he offends the Panda-Men of the party. Ever since, all of the usual suspects have been telling us Fiorina is surging in […]
