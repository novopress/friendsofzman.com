        The term “African-American” is so obnoxious I never let it pass in my presence. It has also predictably stupified language, which determines not only what people can say but what they can think about. I have heard actual Africans referred to as African-Americans.I don’t know what the percentage of blacks in baseball is, but the number is not represented by the number of Americans who are black. But I swear on the grave of Obama’s great grandmother that I have an associate, a hard left liberal, who literally did not see and could not be convinced that a Latin Negro could be considered black.

            The percentage of American blacks playing major league baseball tracks with US demographics. Latins are wildly over represented, but that’s due to foreign born players coming here. Many are obviously black, but they don’t carry the same duffel bag of grievances.
The term “African American” is just stupid. Black people think it is stupid too. I swear they only use it around white people. In the ghetto, it’s black and white.
