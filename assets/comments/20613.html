        Just sitting back and enjoying the schadenfreude in Minneapolis.  This can‚Äôt really be happening, since the city has elected the perfect soy boy mayor, the whole council is leftist.  The PD is woke enough to hire 85 IQ Somali show ponies as officers‚Äìeven if they randomly shoot a white woman talking to their partner.  The state AG is a hard core leftist with a governor just a paper width to his right.  Should be paradise.  They can burn themselves down for all I care.

            We have to hope the rioters take it to the liberal suburbs. In a weird way, the way forward is to encourage these mobs to attack their masters. Ideally, the mobs win and wipe out their masters. Then the gloves are off.

                Maybe, but I notice the police aren‚Äôt so hands off in NYC or LA. Cities or neighborhoods where the real masters live are protected.Also, black looters/rioters never seem to travel far. They limited to areas they can walk to within 20 minutes. Antifa, OTOH, go wherever the bus takes them.

                    Seen a few protests in NY including one where Antifa tried to gum up the main floor at GCT.  Happened to walk in the Lexington side entrance just as a flying squad of NYPD riot guys came in.  Basically did a ‚Äúwheel left forward‚Äù, swept them all up and right out the 42nd street entrance in about 3 minutes.  They had a permit to protest out in front of Trumps old hotel and decided to go off reservation to the Terminal.  NYPD generally exhibits zero tolerance for that.

                        Important people live in NYC. Different rules. Also, a lot of media live and work in NYC, so no coverage.

                        Back in 1979 I went to a ‚Äúsmoke in‚Äù in DC *(NORML, to potalize leeg üòÄ ) and I don‚Äôt remember a lot, but the DJ did announce that the Park Police were very strict and they suggested that everybody be gone by midnight, because in no uncertain terms any stragglers would be cleared out.

                    https://www.takimag.com/article/stop-with-the-golems-already/‚ÄúI have a little golem, I made it out of clay‚Ä¶.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs a bit horrifying that I know ‚ÄúThe Dreidel Song‚Äù. But I was taught it in elementary school when the mother of one of my classmates somehow was given an hour to come in and ‚Äúguest lecture‚Äù about Hanukkah. Even as a snot-nosed 7-yo I wondered, ‚ÄúWhy does Mrs Spellman get to talk an hour about HER customs, but other moms don‚Äôt?‚Äù I was deeply suspicious of the chocolate coins in gold foil that she passed out. Guess I was a Bad Person even then.

                I hope this rioting spreads throughout the country and advances into the suburbs and beyond.  I‚Äôm rooting for violent joggers to burn down suburban shopping malls and vandalize homes all summer.  If nog‚Äôs and their antifa enablers rise up en mass then perhaps the opportunity to resolve this problem will finally present itself.  Despite the screeching of the dimwit news readers, this episode is the best anti diversity education campaign we could ever hope for in a time of otherwise unending race propaganda.  I must admit to a certain wry smugness sitting here in my peaceful corner of  the lily white Rocky Mountains watching these feral animals destroy their vibrant blue metropolises.  The civnats and goodwhites are getting what they voted for good and hard.  Fuck em.

                In local news here in Portland (left coast), they have finally started burning the city down.  Whew!  I was thinking we would miss out!  My wife works remotely for a pozzed non-profit (there‚Äôs no other kind is there?).  All her coworkers this morning were virtue posting about how the rioting is totally legitimate, we need to check our white privilege, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúrebellion‚Äù, not a riot, etc‚Ä¶ I actually found myself getting angrier at these white shitlibs than at the rioters.  I really hope the arsonists make it to their little hipster lofts later tonight.  In all likelihood though they will just burn NorthEast (the black part of town) and the smug white hipsters will live to poz another day secure in the knowledge that the brutal racist cops they hate will not let those mobs anywhere near them.One day these fools will pick up the phone to call 911 when some mob comes to take ‚Äúreparations‚Äù in their neighborhood and there will only be laughter on the other end.

            Seriously, of all the degenerate, backwards, and hopeless denizens of the dispossessed in all the world, the idiot Lutheran Goodwhites in MN settled on ‚ÄúSomalis.‚Äù That was a bold strategy, Cotton, and we‚Äôre all getting to see how that worked out for them.Remembering that makes me much less sympathetic for any Goodwhite suffering in MN right now.

            It‚Äôs really amazing. Everything we‚Äôre seeing from the ruling class, corporations, universities, and 75% of the media now is ‚Äúracism happening‚Äù. They‚Äôd rather let their cities burn than be subjected to Sharkeisha on a rant. Actually it‚Äôs quite inspiring: imagine what Our People could get done if we had this kind of people power? But a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, and the first step is to get people to ignore or not worry about charges of racism.

            But it won‚Äôt, Bruno. This is part of the play and you suggest we play our part: ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt CARE about racism??!? You MONSTER!!!!‚ÄùI like this approach. Rub the normie‚Äôs nose in it with good natured banter and scathing wit as our blog host does ‚Äì and call the spade a spade. There is no defence against it.This guy is a piece of work. He doesn‚Äôt beg or plead for the moral high ground, he just assumes it in a completely moral and ethical way. It works too. ‚ÄúNo, leftie, I am not going to argue with you, nor will I be bullied by you‚Äù is the position we need to take. This tactic is so successful that the clowns will remove themselves from the discussion ‚Äì which leaves it wide open for the adults.

            Racist is an anti-White hate slur . Just as White is a synecdoche for European ,¬†racist¬†is a pejorative metonym for White. Only Whites are called racist¬†.If you notice a non-White you are a racist for making a distinction . If you claim not to see colour , you are a ‚Äòracist‚Äô for denying the non-White their experience of ‚Äòstructural racism‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhite supremacy‚Äô in a racist White society .There are people who will tell you with a straight face that it is not racist to exclude Whites , just as it isn‚Äôt sexist to exclude men .Racist is just another weaponized word that elicits a fixed action response from those who have taken to their conditioning . We have to take back our language .Whites were not consulted and never collectively agreed to accept every other breed of non-White on the planet , at the expense of our own . It‚Äôs natural to be wary of the other . Being called racist is to belabour the obvious and isn‚Äôt going to change our nature . We are not all equal and we have every right to exclude those we don‚Äôt wish to associate with .Racism is a very good thing for Whites and we should never accept the premise that racism is bad.By accepting the premise , even if subtle , that racism is bad, we harm White interests and we let the notion of racism being bad , seep into our subconscious minds.Whites need to stop caring what non-Whites think of us. They are not our kind and we should no more bend to what they think we should think, say and  do , than we would bend to what outsiders might prefer us to think , say or do.On the charge of ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù, I like to declare that I am indeed ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù.Then I like to state that I am the ‚ÄúMost Racist‚Äù person on the planet.I defy the questioner to find someone that is more racist than I am.I dare them to.If such a person is found, I‚Äôd challenge that person to a ‚ÄúRacism Contest‚Äù so that for once and for all, we can find out who ultimately is the most racist person on the planet.I am that ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù.Racist is a code word for Anti-White ‚Äì ‚Äú You‚Äôre only calling me a racist because you‚Äôre anti-White.‚ÄùThe popular definition of a racist as someone who hates other races is a pure inversion . It is impossible to be more wrong, in truth, a racist is a person who loves , prefers and/or prioritizes his own race and seeks to preserve it. A perfectly natural and sensible attitude that obtains in most other countries of the world.Racism is survival, anti-racism is treason and suicide !Saying you can‚Äôt be racist is like saying you can‚Äôt be tall or short, or you can‚Äôt have blue eyes. Everyone is born racist . It is not a choice !Racism isn‚Äôt some kind of mental illness ‚Äì pattern recognition is part of the foundational parameters of rational thought.  Being accused of racism is like being told one is handsome , sensible or intelligent .

            Today at 3:30 EST we are going to watch white men celebrate an attempt at a feat they had accomplish 60 years ago.¬†In the intervening 6 decades we have taken blood and treasure and spent it on an attempt to turn Sub Saharan cavemen into Swiss watchmakers.¬†Young boys in the 60s and 70s flooded the science and engineering departments of our universities dreaming of doing their part in our quest to explore and conquer the great unknown. Instead we‚Äôve spent 20 Trillion in trying to negate biology and 10s of trillions more in financial shenanigans.Instead of attempting and accomplishing great feats we are now striving to repeat what our grandparents and great-grandparents had accomplished and we will celebrate a successful attempt as progress. In 1960 NYC was 85% white and Minneapolis was 95% white. They were well functioning cities with some problems but were still a good place to raise a family.¬†Detroit was the industrial center of the world.¬†Now instead of building cities of the future we are watching them rot away into violent primitive dystopias.We have spend more than 2 generations burning away all of our opportunities and our natural striving to seek more and accomplish more ‚Äì things that have fashioned the character of our inheritance.¬†There are no more exits allowing us to escape the constant attack on who we are as we attempt to preserve who we were. Even the silly escapism that was once fed to us out of Challahwood is now a 24/7 psyops attack.Are we even capable of digging in our heels or does it all have to burn before our people learn to take their own side?

                Au contraire. Dragon will return those men on a reusable spacecraft. As an engineer I‚Äôve been told my whole life by people in the aerospace field (I am not) that this sort of thing was impossible. And I stupidly believed it.

instead we spent a ton of money putting wings into space that were death traps.

Im enthused, and so is my son. Getting independent groups off the earth may be one way to break the stranglehold of the pc crowd and perhaps bring back the frontier spirit.

one can hope!

        Were there riots in Baltimore? Seems like you were ripe. Here in Atlanta well everyone saw it and was rooting for CNN to be razed to the ground obviously.  I just talked to someone who expressed dismay because the protests were so peaceful and then all the sudden they weren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs insane. What she was saying literally sounded like nonsense to me.  much like the babel I hear when people talk about the hypocrisy on the left.The riots aren‚Äôt too far away from me and I‚Äôm in a neighborhood where probably most people are armed but they‚Äôve  indoctrinated their children to debase themselves before the black man.

            Back in the 90‚Äôs I resided in prestigious East Cobb county (do they still call it that?), and worked downtown ‚Äì few blocks from CNN.  This during the Freaknik era ‚Äì if you were around back then.  In those years, another couple riots/protests over‚Ä¶something (Rodney King? ‚Äì I forget).Not sure it‚Äôs different now than it was 25 yrs. ago ‚Äì at least in the ATL.  Joggers gonna‚Äô jog.  Good whites ‚Äì and around where you apparently live no doubt there are plenty of them ‚Äì gonna‚Äô debase themselves and their children.How is that going to go?  Many scenarios I can envision, but my short answer: not well ‚Äì for anyone.  I‚Äôd like to think the theory  Zman posited might work: ‚Äúthe way out of this endless drama is to simply ignore it‚Äù.  That seems less likely with every rerun.

                The first year that Freaknik got big, I was a bartender at a restaurant across the street from the Fox Theater. Yikes! We literally had people coming in the restaurant and peeing on the walls. Cars with drive by at 1 mile an hour, streets were essentially blocked, with their trunks open and women would be in the trunk with their legs spread charging $5 for a feel. Back in those days, I knew that I had to get out of the restaurant business or it would turn me into a racist. Literally that‚Äôs how I thought. It was the job‚Äôs fault.

But then I got back to campus, and saw the campus Diversity ‚Äî i.e. the most coddled, privileged people in the history of the human race ‚Äî doing exactly the same, and I had to ask myself: What, exactly, would they be doing differently if they weretryingto turn me into a racist?

                    Even in normal times, restaurants have double the failure rate of other small businesses (40% vs. 20% a year, if I recall‚Ä¶) COVID-19 is gonna incease that dramatically. On the up side: a chronic, dangerous disease will give surviving businesses legitmate reasons to be choosy about whom gets admitted to the premises. By definition, you won‚Äôt be able to have social distancing, higher safety standards and still allow free access by street denizens. Addicts will have to find another place to shoot up, homeless another place to bathe, and so on. Call us classist and racist, but people with money actually prefer to enjoy shopping or enjoying a service without elevated risk to our personal safety, health and even life.

                Yeah, how does one ignore our vibrancy burning the downtown district to the ground?  There are still 30% or so Whites living there.  In the long run, the powers that be will be sending them more of your tax dollars to rebuild what they destroyed so even if no Whites live there, your pockets are emptied.Seen this since 67-68. We seem never to learn.  In the end only a declaration of ‚Äúshoot on sight‚Äù end the ‚Äúprotest‚Äù.

                    It depends on which suburb. Some of the close-in, wealthy, shitlib suburban types will mouth diversity platitudes while packing to flee to their summer homes for safety.But if the rioters make it to the outer-ring suburbs where suburbia morphs into rural America, the population is 99% white, and everyone drives a 4√ó4 truck with a dead deer in the back come November, buy some popcorn ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs gonna be a hell of a show.

                            Walt, good insight.  I suspect as much.  In the city, you have a larger crowd and the hope of looting a big screen tv.  Risk is minimal.  Cops will warn you, then toss gas and you can run.  Odds are, no arrest and certainly, as of now, no death.Come over to a smallish (in comparison) home in a close knit neighborhood, and you run the risk of several homes zeroing in on you from their rooftops.  A group of you makes a ridiculously easy target since I really don‚Äôt give a shit which of you I hit and where.  A crowd shot would be as easy as hitting a barn‚Äîand I can pull the trigger faster than you can disperse.Hard part is that first shot, but after that they‚Äôre all free.

                Hey dumbass, it is not a race issue, you really think this violent psychopathic pig in a uniform would not do the exact same thing to a white man?The rioters are dumb violent scum, but it does NOT excuse the actions of the Minnesomalia Gestapo thug.The Po-Po better stop their pretend soldier nonsense soon, otherwise things are gonna get very ugly.

                    Sure, but if they did it wouldn‚Äôt be on the news and nobody would care. The media didn‚Äôt create this to fight police overreach, they did it to remind whitey we need to keep in line, or they will release the nogs upon us. Why do you think the first op they tried was with 2 white non-cops? To make it about evil whitey first, and not just cops, at least in black people‚Äôs minds. Then the karen thing in NY, and now this. They want us dead, our children and women raped and they think it‚Äôs funny. Fuck these media jews and their nogger pets.

                    That officer, Derek Chauvin, reminds me of my h.s. principal. Big, rangy guy, 6‚Äô5‚Ä≥. Always admired him. This was in an all-white county h.s. before integration, 1969. Lots of big rough country boys. His presence was a necessary complement to the smooth order of things. Guess you could say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúchauvinist‚Äù.

            Whitney‚Ä¶‚Ä¶stay safe and keep your powder dry, Hon. Since you were a bartender when young you likely have better survival instincts than me. That‚Äôs a crash course in human nature.Here‚Äôs a text thread from a distribution list today of former friends (women, some questionable) from 30 years long gone. An unknown added me to a long dead list of nutters. This is to confirm and see reality for yourself:Thread: ‚ÄúIn general however these time are confusing and alarming to me. Even though I feel personally fortunate, it is hard not to worry about the future of this beautiful Gia earth and about our country‚Äôs culture.‚ÄùResponse: ‚ÄúWe are all in time out to make choices to reframe our relationship with Her! We can do that ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a personal commitment.‚ÄùResponse: ‚ÄúI never expected to witness 2 live murders (Oakland) on TV. I am in shock. Then, by accident, I saw Idiocracy on TV and that was a picture too close for comfort!‚ÄùResponse: ‚ÄúOur police and other private citizens are now murdering black people with impunity. I wouldn‚Äôt believe it if I hadn‚Äôt seen it. Been happening for centuries ‚Äì no for prosecution, officer will get off.‚ÄùResponse:  ‚ÄúIn whatever way we can, will need to stand against the current horrifying resurgence taking place.‚ÄùThis is in real time and what the Boomer left woo-woo Karens are thinking.

        The conservatives are led through this by the nose as usual. Merely a couple days ago, they were all ‚ÄúDems are the Real Racists‚Äù with the Central Park dog walker. It went so far that Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit) endorsed a statement by Van Jones (Black race agitator) that the real danger to Blacks wasn‚Äôt rednecks in Klan robes but nice White liberal ladies. The conservatives just about came in their pants over that.Some didn‚Äôt react to kindly when I said ‚ÄúWhen you find yourself endorsing Van Jones, you have to ask yourself, ‚ÄòWhere have I gone wrong?&#x27;‚Äù Encouragingly, quite a few people got it, though. It became one of the top comments on the thread.With the current riots, once the conservetards found out there was antifa participation, they were again massively excited to find out there were White people they could blame. Representative was my post, ‚ÄúMake Liberia Great Again‚Äù to which one responded ‚ÄúWith a bunch of white Soy boy ANTIFAs? I could get behind that. I mean Liberia already has enough problems but maybe they could sell them to pervert Muslims or something.‚ÄùConservatives are going to ride the ‚ÄúI am not a racist‚Äù box car right to the camps.

            I like and respect the HBD camp (Sailer et al), the race realism camp (Taylor et al), the immigration restriction camp (Vdare), the 2nd amendment crowd, and even the FTN guys (yeah they have a lot of interesting points too).

Jared Taylor, you will not be allowed back on social media and into respectable Beltway party circuits. Nazbol guy, the left will never accept you just because you support universal health care and hate the police state too. Please, for the love of God, stop virtue signaling and falling into the left‚Äôs script. Please, just stand up for your own people. At the very least, when crap like this happens, just stay silent.There‚Äôs no need to engage in negrophilia on 2nd amendment forums or engage in cowardly, cautious, hopelessly reasonable ‚Äúwell it looks like the police made a mistake here‚Äù on the ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù dissident right podcasts. Please, just stay silent ‚Äì don‚Äôt give an ounce to the black undertow. I like you all way too much to see you get dragged into their games and converted into NPC.

            Actually, the true dangers to Blacks would be more or less in order of risk: poor diet, drinking too much alcohol, smoking tobacco, illegal drug use, and being murderd by another Black. Actually Whites share a similar menu of risks, but our murder rate is about 1/6 per capita that of our Melanic Hominid‚Ñ¢ brethren. When it comes to morbidity, we really are our own worst enemy. I‚Äôve done some reading and I‚Äôd guess 2/3 to 3/4 of all serious health problems are directly due to what we eat, smoke and drink. But it sho be hard to give up dat fried chicken, the 40 of malt liquor or the menthol cigarettes üòÄ Even the watermelon would seem healthy, but all that sugar done gonna give you diabletes, I tole you so!

                These guys aren‚Äôt representative of Normies but of the 10% (1% all the gains, 10% hold the line 89% shafted)Also the GOPe cares for very little other than money and can‚Äôt be expected to behave in any other way.The only reasons they care about riots are that the lack of stability hurts the economy and that they  resent other people looting.In any case these well coifed, well off types aren‚Äôt going to express beyond the pale views even if they  can think them. They are good citizens of the Empire after all.

        I tried to ignore the riots, but the stories are omnipresent with extensive coverage on ‚Äúconservative‚Äù sites, and not exclusively the realm of cable television.Despite the never-ending coverage, my attitude is of complete indifference.  What that tells me is that I no longer care about the rules and the current power structure, which is different than the ‚Äúpox on all their houses‚Äù attitude the the NRO-types like to take.  If others feel they way I do then perhaps that is progress.

            I‚Äôm right there with you ‚Äì I feel indifferent and try hard to remain detached from it all, because otherwise the typical nogger drama evokes rage, which is the entire purpose of the morality play.

        Our new nomenklatura, true to form, is running the old Stalin playbook. Stalin routinely gutted his nation in pursuit of his paranoid vendettas. The Holodomor because he hated kulaks, for instance, and Soviet agriculturestillhadn‚Äôt recovered by the time the USSR fell (just in case you think Kung Flu wasn‚Äôt so bad on our economy). Wreckers, saboteurs, Left-deviationists, Right-deviationists‚Ä¶ always a new enemy, and if the Soviet economy had to be thrown back to the Stone Age each and every time, well, so be it.The only reason it didn‚Äôt go on forever is that life in the Soviet Union was physically miserable. Life in the USSA is physically pretty nice, and will continue to be for the most part, despite the Kung Flu (though not for lack of trying on our Masters‚Äô part). It can‚Äôt go on forever here, either, but that‚Äôs because sportsball, porn, and gibs have createdCalhoun‚Äôs rat utopia.It won‚Äôt be long before suburban White kids start joining in the rioting‚Ä¶ and not long after that, they‚Äôll start rioting in their own neighborhoods, because who‚Äôs going to stop them?

            Collapse is the inevitable end. The question is whether some authoritarian steps into the breech first, thus delaying the inevitable. I think we are seeing that now with the lock downs. The authoritarian in a liberal democracy will wield soft power, rather than hard power. It will also be a collective, rather than a strong man. America is about to be taken over by a committee that does not meet in public or acknowledge its own existence.

        I can already see the writing on the wall that this is going to end in anarcho-tyranny.Within just a few weeks time we saw cops going from full stasi on anyone (esp. whites) doing normal activities because of Wu-Flu to basically backing down to Tyrone because of their lefty handlers telling them to. So they don‚Äôt care who they get to pounce on, most enjoy the power trip and will gladly divert to white males if they are the only acceptable target left. The narrative is, in fact, being built right now and has been for years with the FBI focus on ‚Äòdomestic terrorism‚Äô, etc etc.Lawmakers are going to start passing laws that give Tyrone a pass to do whatever the f-ck he wants (Again, we saw this already with non-enforcement of lockdown in ghetto areas, etc) and whitey is going to be broken on the wheel for increasingly superfluous bullchit.If you doubt this, consider that White Supremacists! are mainly the ones causing riots. (see linked article). See, we are in Clown World now. And if 2+2=5 and black people rioting are actually white supremacists then that is what we say it is you f-cking plebe, question it at your own peril esp. if you are a white male. You will be made a prisoner in your own society and if you think the Karens and Soyboys are going to protest you haven‚Äôt been paying attention.

        The shocking thing for me, at least in ATL, was that I saw young whites of both sexes involved in the protest. I guess their lifelong marination in white hatred thanks to our media and ‚Äúeducational‚Äù system had finally borne its evil fruit.There were the Antifa idiots assaulting cars on a California freeway. How those goons weren‚Äôt shot is beyond me.The one positive from these insurrections is that even the most oblivious Normie-con can‚Äôt ignore when objective reality slaps them in the face. Sub-85 IQ savages aren‚Äôt compatible with our civilization. We‚Äôve spent trillions on them and they‚Äôve never lifted themselves ‚Äúup by the bootstraps‚Äù out of multi-generational poverty.We seemingly subsidize the sexual proclivities of imbeciles in a reverse eugenics that ensures that support is provided for Chalmydia Fabulous and her 12 feral offspring by 10 different daddies, but whites are taxed to the point where they can‚Äôt afford more than a couple of kids at best.

                This is a myth.Most  of the money we pay in taxes goes to social security and medicare and the rest military spending.We borrow everything else including welfare programs which  quite a few Whites use as well.The issue is simply a decline  wages. For 90% of the population wages are down measured as percent GDP down by half since 1973 and drop roughly at  the rate 1% a yearThe ratio is more or less 90% shafted. (% hold the line, 1% get it allThe 90-9-1 rule if you like.Fertility decline tracks near exactly with wage decline BTW, it hit below replacement in 1973 when the recession hit and as wages never recovered only declined, the  fertility rate stayed the same. Now easy divorce was a contributor but divorce rape was not a common thing pre 90‚Äôs at least known to be.The wage decline comes from 4  sources , 1st open borders/cheap labor 2nd free trade  3rd female workforce entry and 4th  most perniciously automation.The first two could be mitigated easily enough, the 3rd and 4th would require non democratic means.And note , its not possible to cut enough in Social Security to recurred the tax burden . If you got rid of the program, this would increase wages about 8-10% (the employer contribution would just get pocketed by them) which might add 5k per family which would accomplish nothing.Its not enough for an extra kid and people would know need to save more to stop workin. Heck most would not stop working and  jobs would basically not open.Medicare could be fixed some but again not enough savingsLastly, military. We can cut 1/3 of the spending and go to the minimum 2% but that‚Äôs a lot of jobs gone.If we were to cut basically everything to the bare bones after a debt default, we‚Äôd end up with much higher savings than we have uses for and not get more kids,The only way to fix it is simply to make sure there is debt  jubilee  or default and that income goes up faster than inflation.This may not be possible which emans we‚Äôll bash our society to pieces and to a sustainable level of complexity before we stabilize.It will not be fun.

                            Me? Nothing. Unlike the CivNats, I am quite realistic about the level of black vote that can be obtained by Trump. It will be around 7%, the same as 2016.But the key is not to have blacks vote Trump, the key to winning MI,PA,FL,OH and even WI is to ensure that more blacks do not vote against Trump. Trump won in 2016 in MI as many blacks stayed home and did not vote for the shrieking Harpie.Trump strategy against Slow-Joe is obvious, point out Chinaman Biden‚Äôs racist statements, his support for the 1994 Crime bill and blacks will not support the old racist traitor. Blacks may not vote Trump, but they will not vote Biden either.

                                You vastly underestimate the hive mind of the black bloc vote. Biden could murder black babies on live TV and they‚Äôll still vote 95% for him; hell it might even drive up black voter enthusiasm for him. ‚ÄúSheeeeiit, that man ain‚Äôt playin, he‚Äôs the real thing!‚ÄùBy the way, blacks LOVED Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou Ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù comments. Their affection for him rose because they LOVE paternalistic and maternalistic figures. Only delusional CivNats and Con, Inc. deluded themselves into thinking this hurt Biden.Chinaman Biden? 1994 Crime Bill? Blacks don‚Äôt remember or care about details like this, only people like you do. Sorry, but you‚Äôre the epitome of a CivNat. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the D candidate says, does, or thinks ‚Äì blacks never remember these details and enthusiastically check D no matter what.Seriously, when Trump gets an insignificant fraction of the black vote in November, I urge you to return here and reexamine your delusions.

                                If Biden picks an authentic Black VP, the Black vote will follow.  The somewhat hidden message spoken in the Black community will be that the VP will replace Biden in his first term.Similarly, the White vote will consider this also after having such a disaster with Obama.  There are a lot more Whites still than Blacks. Food for thought.

Trump has promised much, and delivered less than what you and others here want, but the total failure you describe will not be an issue except for you and a smallish minority.His issues are still resonating and there is no one to pick up the gauntlet either at a primary level or the Presidential level. The opposition, Biden &amp; Dem‚Äôs, will run on doing the opposite of Trump‚Äînot the same policies only better‚Äîthe opposite of Trump.That dog no longer hunts outside of the Leftists of the Dem party.

        One small but revealing tell on narrative vs. reality in these cases: I actually lived in Ferguson, MO for a couple of years, about a decade before the trouble there. It certainly surprised me to hear one news organization after another describe it as ‚Äúthe small town of Ferguson‚Äù. In fact, it is no such thing: it‚Äôs a close suburb of St. Louis wedged between downtown and the airport, most definitely part of the metro area. So why the ‚Äúsmall town‚Äù thing? Because ‚ÄúTo Kill a Mockingbird‚Äù and its innumerable clones (‚ÄúA Time to Kill‚Äù, etc‚Äù) imprinted leftist journos from big coastal cities with a narrative about racial injustice happening in small southern towns. So when even this small detail of the reality of the story didn‚Äôt fit the script of the standard morality play, they bent reality to fit the script.Which is, of course, common practice with them. It‚Äôs narrative that matters, not reality; it‚Äôs morality that matters, not facts.

            Just saw the ending of the hit movie, ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù.  What prescience!  Hundreds of people are shown rioting and looting in the streets.  Celebrating the anarchy of it all.  All are wearing masks‚Äîclown masks‚Äîin honor of their new anarchist leader, the Joker.Now look at the rioters in any of these cities, but particularly Minneapolis.  They‚Äôre wearing ‚Äúface diapers‚Äù, aka surgical masks.    All at the behest of our ‚Äúleadership‚Äù to prevent a dreaded fauxdemic, COVID-19.  The police film them from afar, but will not identify them later.  Oh the sweet irony of it all.I must admit to being depressed all week.  But now, somehow I‚Äôm feeling happy, even elated.  Soon I‚Äôm certain, I‚Äôll be practicing my own Joker dance on our own smoldering ashes.  üôÇ

        One of the biggest problems we have is one Zman has written about many times. So many damned whites FEAR being called racist.I never fear being called racist because we all are racist. That simply means I am programed by God, Nature, Evolution, or some combination of the above to see the differences in people. I also believe in HBD results that tell us that IQ and behavior have a lot to do with heredity.Try it sometime: ‚Äúyou are racist!‚Äù. ‚ÄúEveryone is racist, so what?‚ÄùI got called ‚Äúracist‚Äù by a black student in class because I called him down for pushing his own blood brother as the brother passed by his seat. I responded, ‚ÄúHave you never noticed your brother is every bit as black as you are?‚Äù The class is laughing at him and the boy never said more than a few words to me the rest of the school year. (note: his is now in prison)At an inter-faith meeting our SJW Roman Catholic Priest called many of the local police policies ‚Äúracist‚Äù because they were arresting more black young men than white young men. Apparently the black Chief of Police was not pleased, nor many of the black officers that Chief had hired. He took the stage to say that ‚Äúwe arrest those who break the law‚Äù.If we are to save western civilizaion we will have to stop worrying about someone calling us names. Sticks and stones and all that.

        Couple of thoughts.  It‚Äôs absolutely worthwhile to put this issue under a spotlight and dissect it.  Once the dissection is over, though, ‚Äúthe race drama‚Äù needs to be set alongside the white-elite progressives who cheer barbarism, alongside the white-fright response to a pseudo pandemic, alongside the economic fragility of MMT and forever-expanding digital dollars,  alongside continual immigration of the swarthy masses, alongside faggotry and associated perversions, alongside demographics.  There are many other ‚Äúalongsides.‚Äù  Z-man addresses them all, and that‚Äôs why a compendium of essays in book format would be GREAT to give to our thoughtful friends trapped in 20th century groupthink.There are really only two possible responses for Whitey.  Teary-eyed hand-wringing over the loss of the Constitution, the loss of homeland, the loss of the country I once knew.  (I‚Äôm in my 50s now ‚Ä¶ took me a few years to work through that initial response, but time was on my side in the 1990s.)  Today, time isn‚Äôt on the side of teary-eyed handwringing ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt have the money to move‚Äù excuses.  Things are going south, deteriorating rapidly it seems.  But nostalgia is still an option ‚Ä¶ for those who think hope is a grand strategy (whilst residing in the enemy camp), I wish them well.Option 2 is clear-eyed, recognizing there‚Äôs an enemy who hates us and wants to take us out.  The enemy has many alliances, reminding us that we need allies as well.  Option 2 means taking steps ‚Äì ASAP ‚Äì to bolster family security, develop water/food and shelter independence.  Collocate with allies, disassociate from known enemies (e.g. public schools.)  Meanwhile, ridicule and mock the enemies.  We talk a lot about community ‚Ä¶ I think we need to lean really hard on the clergy, peeling as many away as possible from mainstream do-goodery ‚Äì they need to be on the side of truth &amp; righteousness or they‚Äôre the enemy.  Develop robust homeschooling co-ops. Cultivate and train young tradesmen in skills that can‚Äôt be easily outsourced or roboticized.  Option 2 takes on a myriad of forms but they have one thing in common ‚Äì decisive action.

                It has very little  to do with self loathing. Whites have rioted , looted and burned many times in the past over various grievances too.Heck Whites were active in some areas in the 1992 riots as well.And truth is White people have been screwed over every bit as much as Black people.  Youngsters of that generation have 1/3 the wealth (assets minus debts)  of the baby boomers and probably make half or less what the boomers did.They are painfully aware of this and between the wage arbitrage and the lock down its no wonder they are pissed.Having allies just makes the looting easier.Unlike the riot set though Antifa has goals and discipline which is something  the Dissident Right needs.I am not saying anyone  should act out, what Antifa is doing is criminal  and the DR doesn‚Äôt have   political cover anyway but having goals and discipline and energy deserves respect and ought to be emulated.

            E dear‚Ä¶..surely you recognize that ideology trumps a pair of eyes and reality. A few late comers will pop loose. Between you and me and a couple others, when I was a little kid sailing in my swing on the old walnut tree, I used to wonder why the jews didn‚Äôt get out. They experienced a few years that showed them it would end in the big ugly. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt run, and set it aside in a drawer in my brain for further incoming data. The last 5 years the data flowed in. Lineman is right. Ideology and blinkered family trumps safety. Trumps all reason. All my family and Basic Husband‚Äôs family are in Peoples Republic of Cali and they refuse to move. I am having to condition myself that they are making a choice‚Ä¶their agency‚Ä¶.their soul journey if you will‚Ä¶and I can just bugger off. In my case, to have family is to not talk about‚Ä¶the obvious. I can see‚Ä¶know‚Ä¶.do‚Ä¶and keep quiet.

        The thing suprising about this episode is it seems to be a genuine outrage.  These morality plays are almost always played with someone who won a Darwin Award. Because the white or cop was obviously in the right, the sacrificial lamb‚Äôs death goes unpunished and everyone pretends to be outraged at how the white or cop gets away with gunning down an innocent black man.Why are the blacks rioting? 4 cops were fired immediately and charges laid within 3 day. That is virtually unprecedented for one of these tales.

It‚Äôs why they burn and loot any business they can regardless of ownership. Africa always wins.Antifa, the white people, are just surfing the wave to actually attack targets like the police and CNN.

        We actually had a pseudo-riot in Denver 2 nights ago and it was mostly composed of bored and spoiled SJWs who were in need of some outdoor exercise due the the COVID lockdown.

Most cops are now affirmative action minorities who can‚Äôt even tie their shoes let alone control an angry mob.

            Here in Utah the Salt Lake suckbutts turned out 20 possible people to whine and cringe on the steps of the unitarian church. Examining the picture I sort of identified 1 tranny in a dress, a black something virtue signaling, and a blue haired sexually ambiguous someone. 200 people showed up downtown, mostly white lefties, many old Boomers, groveling and genuflecting. Today they will drive in a caravan around the formerly Mormon formerly beautiful city to wail and keen. People that are colored different hues don‚Äôt give a crap. All quiet here in southern Utah. Surprised the university here didn‚Äôt bust loose a small coven to virtue signal. The Piutes don‚Äôt give a crap as they don‚Äôt deal with blacks and stay away from white people unless they can do an AIM thing and get white people to bow and open the pocket book to them. Also Indian ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù men love to rope in young guilty white chicks. They pay handsome dividends.Let‚Äôs not forget to dump the lefties back into the People‚Äôs Republic along the west/east coasts when the great sorting hat is activated.

        No justice, no Nerf guns left in your Target.Your point about living in the present applies to so many who are more or less on our side. Like the media/system trusters with the virus who somehow forgot that the media are cynical liars and a pr outlet for a ruling class that hates us and would he happier if we were all dead. Or conservatives who forgot about Iraq and Afghanistan when Syria came around.I suspect this comes from a commitment to ideology over practical concerns about things like reality.It‚Äôs easy to forgot that the media, for instance, are psychopathic liars when they are saying something that confirms what you want to be true. I tend to do that tbh.The media heads being unaware of history is also a commitment to their narratives over truth.So then perhaps this means we are all saturated in ideology. Even supposed dissidents. I used to look the other way at that, but lately Ive grown tired of it. In a post Christian society the temptation to fallback to ideology, i am realizing, is too strong for most people.Im not averse to ideas and narratives per se, but when i see a self professed right winger who picks ideology over obvious reality or just basic common sense i have to wonder what is the point even of being right wing? Odd that this usually happens with people who were committed leftists who ‚Äúsaw the light‚Äù and realized they could solve all of the world‚Äôs problems with ideology AND racism.You see this with capitalism. I dont have any particular commitment to capitalism, but theres a large group of dissidents who seem to view capitalism as a system straight from hell created by the devil himself, but otoh while the media and ruling class of that system are also bad you gotta take them on a case-by-case basis and at least hear them out. Something doesnt add up there.

            I wonder if it‚Äôs more that ‚Äúthe Right‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a coherent movement with any ideology of its own.  Thinking the media is a den of vicious liars about Trump or Afghanistan is a start but if you take their word as gospel when they talk about Covid or Syria you actually don‚Äôt have an ideology of your own.  The old Marxists actually had the right idea here. They always made sure their grand theories had a doctrine about the role of everything in the grand drama of the Glorious Proletarian Revolution.  They never took bourgeois institutions at their word.A great deal of even the DR probably has the idea that some core element of the Establishment is still legitimate and that we can evaluate the ruling class‚Äô actions on a case by case basis ‚Äì Afghanistan was totally an unjust fiasco but Syria, now that‚Äôs the real deal, we need to send American boys to bleed on THAT sand.  As for the boomer-cons, well they‚Äôre all still sitting around waiting for Zombie Reagan to drive up in his DeLorean and take them back to 1983.  They just want things to go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù so they can pop open a Bud Light, turn on some Sportsball, and go back to sleep.Of course there is a danger to ideology which is that it oversimplifies reality but it does not seem to be an impediment to taking power.  Witness the Left‚Äôs remarkable rebound from what should have been the crushing defeat of watching the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact unravel.  In only 30 years they‚Äôve gone from being shown the futility of all their ideas to being able to impose them once again all over the Western world.

        This is a very good analysis of the situation.  It reminds us that blacks and whites can never live together.  Not only do blacks see themselves as victims of whites, but they believe that IF ONLY whites hadn‚Äôt colonized Africa, they would have some advanced civilization like in the movie Black Panther, which I never saw.  Somehow evil white European came to Africa in his powdered wig and destroyed their whole civilization.  In reality what little civilization there is in the world was an invention of the white man.  We need to realize, as whites, that the Curse of Ham exists, and that they need to be forcibly removed from our communities at some point.  It‚Äôs the only way.  The Civil War would have been worth it had they actually been forcibly removed to Liberia at the end.

        Here‚Äôs an idea of what some Zoomer peers are thinking. From Zoomer meme pages:Trump called the Minneapolis rioters THUGS. But he called the Michigan milita protesting with guns ‚Äúgood people‚Äù. Xrumpft raycis!!!Why are Black People not allowed to riot in Minneapolis, but the KKK are allowed to hold demonstrations? The police are the KKK.Not only are these horrible comparisons, but they are also just not true, and ignoring the constitution, etc. Nope, facts and logic ain‚Äôt gonna fix this. We need separation.

        &gt;‚ÄùIn theory, the way out of this endless drama is to simply ignore it. Get enough white people to stop showing up or even acknowledging these dramas and the theater runs out of audience members.‚ÄùWell sure, and as you point out, that‚Äôs exactly what happened withJogger. They then tried screeningAttack of the Central Park Karen, but getting bitched out by Karen is something that‚Äôs happened to all of us, so everyone just shrugged it off. That‚Äôs exactly why the Big Floyd case required an escalation. Antifa figured that nobody could ignore them burning down a half-dozen American cities over it, and they‚Äôre right ‚Äì we can‚Äôt. The question is whether that will redound to their benefit in an election year. Recent history ‚Äì from 1968 to 2016 ‚Äì suggests that it will not.

        Every once and a while America needs a new Great Awakening. A spasm of religiosity seizes the Yankee and he ruins the country in some way. Abolition and Prohibition were reflections of this, but as Yankee religion became more democratic, they are officially known as congregationalists, this impulse became more secular. So the 60‚Äôs religious insanity involved moving to California and becoming a hippy.Now negrophilia has seized the Yankee/ Good White mind once again. They worship Social Justice now, it is the newest impulse of the descendants of the Mayflower. They are more extreme, policy wise, than the their Person of Color Objects of Maternal Stimulus (POCOMS)

        The paradox of these cops versus blacks riot-dramas is that we live in a country that worships cops.
Cops are worshiped all over the world, at least outwardly. But the aware realize that even if the cops are a necessity in a large, complex society, you‚Äôre better off if you never meet one. When a cop dies on the job he‚Äôs instantly a hero. In any other profession death as a work event is regarded as a failure. In fact, often when a cop breaks the law, we aren‚Äôt even really informed ofhis identity.

        The police exist to serve and protect the state. When idiot blacks commit crimes and come out on the short end of the stick it is hard to sympathize. Being a cop a healthcare worker or a soldier in itself does not make you a hero. What thinking person isn‚Äôt sick to death of the we are in this together, we are here for you, you are a hero diatribe? The state always has been and always will be the enemy of the people. Avoid armed government workers if at all possible. Government is not anyone‚Äôs friend especially in a multi-culti paradise like ours. Black behavior and inability must continually be given a pass. Something serious needs to be done. White guilt enables bad black behavior and alleviates their responsibility to do anything about it at the same time. The black community and culture are better left to themselves. Avoid blacks especially when they are in large groups. One never knows when they may erupt in a chimp out. Chimp outs are bad. A ne‚Äôer do well negro resists arrest ends up dead and like magic it enables the obfuscation to commence in earnest. Again. Being a White Anglo Saxon Protestant has never felt so good. It really is OK to be White. Can‚Äôt keep the government in check. Can‚Äôt keep the joggers in check. Amicable separation is preferable.

        Friedrich Nietzsche, in his book: ‚ÄúOn the Genealogy of Morality.‚ÄùTalked aboutressentiment.He was using it to discribe the bitter feelings the weak have for the strong. The weak start out wanting what the strong have but they can‚Äôt have it. So they begin a revaluation process of what the strong have and proclaim it evil. It is the master v slave morality. This is what the left has been doing sense the French Revolution. They have demonized everything the Anglo-Europeans ever held dear. It is the 230 year guilting of White Western Civilisation. It is the demoralization and pussification of the White man. Every time a White person has the urge to defend themselves, a lifetime of leftist indoctrination screams in their skulls, NO! THAT‚ÄôS EVIL! Liberty starts with purging that voice from our minds.

        Just today visiting an old friend was taking off to the side and in a low whisper told me to behave myself because they had black neighbors.Went back to the barbecue but later on saw my friend‚Äôs wife running across the street just gushing over these negroes.  They lived in that house now for 7 years, don‚Äôt know any of the other white neighbors but seem to worship the darkies.Would they change their minds should the black plague descend upon their little suburban utopia ?Maybe ?

        Joggerman and the Orinthologist both got knocked off the pages. The latter, however, was quite an improvement over Jussi Smollett‚Äôs crude production. You have to wonder how many birds he dogged before landing the perfect situation with the tweaked woman. Selective videography like in Covington and an adroit rollout by sister. And the clincher was his statement after the woman lost her job and dog. Even if it might have been an attempt to recapture some lost media inertia, his closing remarks ensure the stunt‚Äôs inclusion in Project 1619‚Äôs Revised History of America.

        The exit is the thin blue line, blue as in Hillary.If you look at the riots or plague, they map blue.The police ARE the problem as they are in some kind of Afghan war like quagmire in the black neighborhoods but will crush your business if you try to break the lockdown.  Or give you a ticket while you watch the homeless take a dump and shoot up.That is minor in comparison to ‚ÄúI was in fear of my life‚Äù which gives the blue total immunity the blacks can only dream about.  See excited delirum and PCP.  Floyd MIGHT have been high and able to break out of his handcuffs and slaughter the four cops if the cop let up for an instant.  This is usually the ‚ÄúHe was in 25 feet and if I didn‚Äôt blow him away his reaching for his waistband might have resulted in a knife where I wouldn‚Äôt arrive home safe at night‚Äù.Better 100 dead innocent civilians than one cop not getting home safely because they hesitated.It will get more interesting after the famine hits.

        Please don‚Äôt confuse negrophilia for necrophilia. (I‚Äôm not claiming Z‚Äôs essay did!) While the former is progressively approved and the latter is often illegal, let me note its benefits: So far, nobody has said it‚Äôs wrong to force the dead to live, er, reside, in their own sections of town. In fact, properties are often zoned specficially for their use. Stores, theaters and other public areas are allowed to prohibit their entry.

            Once they start shooting looters wholesale, I‚Äôll begin paying closer attention. Before they do though, I really, really hope CNN gets thoroughly destroyed, along with the rest of the mainstream media. Hell, even the cucks on Fox were going on and on about how ‚Äújustified‚Äù the anger was. Burn them down as well.

        Another relevant angle is recently-arrived immigrant blacks who grasp what a lottery-win this country is.

My wife works with a Haitian immigrant female who listens to the native black cant about racism and privilege, and finds it nuts.

We need to get real leaders like Allen West out there to combat the idiocy and get to the truth: 23 chromosome pairs = human, at least until the mouth opens and the fools stands revealed.

            There is an old 60 Minutes episode about black immigrants. And I remember them being put off by American blacks, who often didn‚Äôt apply themselves or work because of ‚Äúmuh racist society‚Äù (this was before the ‚Äúmuh‚Äù meme of course).

                Years ago one of my kids ran AAU track.  Which in this area meant lots of quality time with the Caribbean crowd at local meets.  Track is a religion down there.  On the whole, they despised the local brand and half the reason they had their kids in the sport was to keep them away from the native variety.

                        aucontraire. Good Whites hear what they want to hear, especially from most Blacks who hide their hatred behind supposed grievances.  Thus giving good Whites the illusion that if only they work to solve such grievances, all can be made well.Calypso Louie calls the White man the devil and the source of all evil in the world‚Äîand will brook no repentance from Whitey. That man is Hitler‚Äôs doppelg√§nger and Whitey are his Jews.

            I have a neighbor who is a Nigerian immigrant who arrived here with $20 and now owns a huge house, a couple of Mercedes and 10 gas stations. We were talking at a neighborhood grillout before the Kung Flu hit and he was ranting about how lazy American blacks were and how he had to fire some of them working for him for stealing or not showing up for work.His son was a big-time football player at one of the SEC schools and got a DUI and a suspension from the team. The father goes with the son to the university and gets his son reinstated.He told me he straightened his son out with a belt and I had to laugh. Long story short, his son graduated with a MBA, played a few years in the NFL and owns some gas stations of his own.

                Magic Negro stuff aside, I can second such an experience.  Once was at a gathering, large, all White government/professional types with one exception‚Äîa young Black couple.Oddly, or perhaps not so odd.  The Black couple was seated at one of those 8 person round tables alone, while every one was engaged bullshitting with every other ‚Äúimportant‚Äù person.  I‚Äôm not that type, so I sat down with my plate of food and eventually, we spoke.The Black man introduced himself, I had suspected he was foreign. He stood up to do so, his wife remained seated.  He obviously was trained in proper etiquette. He and his wife were Black as night, not American Negro brown. He gave his name as Joseph and his wife, Mary.  English was impeccable, dressed very well‚Äîbut nothing foreign looking‚Äîmagazine stylish, somewhat of an African accent. Pleasant however.They were from the Congo and were refugees sponsored to be here.  Missionaries had raised and educated them in the Congo.  He was a law clerk for the city.  They had a couple of children who were not present.  I asked him how he liked his job and what he did and such.Obviously an AA hire, but not incompetent.  He was leaving soon to go to NYC.  There to attend Columbia U law school.  In the next 20 minutes or so, he outlined a plan for their future that was well conceived as any I‚Äôve heard.  I have no doubt he succeeded.  Never during the conversation was there a hint of a chip on his shoulder.  He and wife knew that had it made in America.  And they did.

                        My intention was not setting him up as a positive example‚Äîbut for American Blacks he could very well be.The anecdote is to show a stark contrast between an American Black‚Äîwho has been given every advantage (post civil rights) for three generations‚Äîand yet is still an ingrate and unable to succeed. Whereas, his cousin from Africa‚Äîfar more disadvantaged, got the hell out of that shit hole‚ÄîAfrica. Turned his back on his jungle roots, adopted a superior culture and manner‚Äîdress, names, language‚Äîand made a success of himself in this country.Such a situation is quite similar to my father who came here after the war. America used to be populated by such people. Alas, no more.

                So what. The guy took advantage of all the affirmative actin programs and SBA set asides to get what no white is allowed to no matter how talented,You really have no clue how much the Feds and state agencies bend over to help blacks. They have access to state and county jobs that white men  can‚Äôt even apply for.But wait there is more. Negro students are all socially promoted, they are not allowed to fail unless he drop out. So that magic black man with the MBA is really just a result of affirmative action.

                    That‚Äôs precisely the point.  With all the advantages enjoyed, we still have a population of malcontents who can not prosper.Now we all understand why this is wrt American minorities. We are race realists.  The stories here center upon, oddly enough, folks who have not been raised in this liberal/leftist environment known as America.  Yet, they come to this place and prosper?  What is the difference?Certainly, they are select in some way.  IQ‚Äîsure.  But there is also an attitude that they bring, or fail to bring.  Seems we instill an attitude of failure or at least and excuse for failure in our minorities.  It‚Äôs a heady drug to blame one‚Äôs poor life choices on Whitey.  Hell, it‚Äôs even affecting Whites.

You‚Äôre both wonderful.I‚Äôve seen the error of my ways. Race doesn‚Äôt matter, only character. We should let every smart or hard-working person into this country regardless of color. America has always been a beacon for people wanting to improve themselves. It‚Äôs says so right on the Statue of Liberty.Just kidding, of course. You‚Äôre story is hilarious. You‚Äôve never had to write for a living, have you. I mean, there‚Äôs schlock and then there‚Äôs crap. Look, you have to make the story at least somewhat believable. CivNat are incredibly gullible, but even they are going to buy that story. You can do better.

                This. This. This. We‚Äôve poached the talented tenth from other countries, and they need to be immediately returned to their countries of origin so they can shore up the medical professions, universities, legal systems, engineering and research industries, and business fields in their own countries.As long as we keep poaching this talented tenth, their native countries will continue collapsing, resulting in worse and worse migration of the other 90% to our lands. Every country needs a smart fraction and the US shouldn‚Äôt be imperiously stealing it from them.We don‚Äôt need talented Haitians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Indians, or Syrians. Haiti, the Phillipines, Nigeria, India, and Syria need them more.Amazingly, my lefty friends have been way more sympathetic to this point of view than the CivNat ‚Äúas long as they come here LEGALLY; we need SKILLED immigrants‚Äù traitors like Matt Gaetz.Z is always talking about how the dissident right needs to police its borders from grifters. The ‚ÄúI know a Good Nigerian LEGAL and SKILLED immigration crowd‚Äù needs to be excommunicated and banished to Antartica, including negrophilic grifters and trolls in this very comments section, like UpYours.

            Sure, smitty, you go round up Allen West and other magic black conservatives and the truth will win the day.  Perhaps your wife‚Äôs Haitian immigrant coworker can help ‚Äì we all know Haitians don‚Äôt want gibs like American blacks ‚Äì they just want a fair chance.  And besides, it‚Äôs character not color.

            If anything can be said for immigrants from sub-Sahara, it is that they loathe American blacks. Now most of those I‚Äôve met could be called the ‚Äútalented tenth‚Äù so maybe not representative. I‚Äôm no bleeding heart liberal by any means, but my current heart doc is a Haitain immigrant. I‚Äôve not checked his credentials, but the State thinks highly enough of him to let him practice medicine. So far, he‚Äôs done nothing more invasive than start me on statins and bombard me with x-rays. I‚Äôll repose confidence in him, unless he starts giving me amulets, magic potions or tells me I have to slaughter a chicken üòÄ
