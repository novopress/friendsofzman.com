        I just have to disagree with Z-man’s last sentence. There’s plenty of people who know pretty much what needs to be done to reform our financial system, our tax system, our healthcare system, and our legal system.Most of these steps fall under the heading of “clean out the Augean stables” It’s time to flush out the corruption that is piled sky high and miles wide.It would be simple, not complicated to do many of these things. So, if I was king for a day, here’s what I’d decree:Taxes: Repeal the income tax and nuke the IRS. Institute a nationwide 15% sales tax.Legal: Immediately kill the EPA and the DOE, HUD, and the TSA. These are properly state or private functions anyway. Pass the Liberty Amendments, more or less in toto. Pass reasonable tort reform. Also require all public corporations over a certain size to pay all employees in voting stock, at a rate of 25% of salary.For healthcare: Abolish Medicare and the VA. Give generous vouchers to all recipients to spend as they individually see fit. At the same time, require all doctors and hospitals to publish their prices, and their quality ratings on each doctor. Require all insurance companies to use the same forms, the same codes, and to pay the patients directly.For banking: Abolish the Federal Reserve, outlaw fractional reserve banking, and set up simple reasonable usury laws. Require all mortgage lenders and attorneys to use the same simple set of forms for each sale. Require all speculative financial players to exit the regulated banking system and form separate entities, using ONLY private funding and private insurance. Require any bank larger than a certain size to exit consumer banking and the FDIC system.I’m sure the astute readers of this blog can come up with several clear simple additions in each of these four areas, such as phasing out Social Security, outlawing public employee unions, repealing the death tax, etc. I’m also sure that pretty much everyone can imagine how dynamically the American economy would respond to all these steps. The government would shrink, even as the economy boomed dramatically, and tax receipts went higher.The only problem is, a LOT of wealthy powerful entrenched interests would end up taking a big haircut when these things happen. So, as Reagan said, “There are no easy answers, but there are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally right.”So I’d add just one more thing, to bolster our courage : We should strengthen the 2nd amendment to state that any weapon carried into battle by an American soldier, shall be legal for any honest citizen to own and carry. That includes mortars, hand grenades, .50 caliber sniper rifles, automatic rifles, and bazookas, among others. That ought to give our (remaining) legislators whatever fortitude they need to stand up for the constitution and ordered liberty.

            You won’t see price competition in healthcare until the cartelized monopoly is broken up. The only way to do that is by abolishing licensing and accreditation.

                well, yes but…  I would be disinclined to use the services of a non-accredited heart surgeon  — should the need ever arise.  Indeed, how would one identify quality without some sort of standards?

                    By reputation, the same way many of us evaluate surgeon’s now, but better as we’d be more astute rather than depending to greater or lesser degree, depending upon the patient, on the License. Some docs now are known by reputation as Quacks. I’m an old guy lucky enough to have had &amp; still have very few medical issues so don’t keep up, but some yrs ago a web site started by some concerned about a particular doc operating on wrong body parts or persons multiple times listed all doc law suits &amp; allowed patients to post reviews. At the time the docs raised hell, saying such didn’t tell the whole story &amp; was unfair. I don’t know if it still exists, but such would be better than a license.With no accreditation at all you know very well, Stanford, MIT, Ga Tech, UT-Austin, and such are top colleges. In my town ignoring accreditation we know of a small, much cheaper &amp; must faster service hospital but know you don’t go there for the big stuff.

        My grandfather had a more secure retirement than I will.  He was an elevator operator (kids ask your teacher what that is?) and I was a Telecom Engineer.My grandparents and my mother lived through the Depression and the War very well, the Danish cousins in NH had farms, with vegetables, chickens and eggs.  They drove up and stocked up with produce that they ate and sold in the neighborhood.   Those farms are all condos now, faint good they are anyone now.I expect that the government will start confiscating  bank and retirement accounts from the elderly before I’m gone (the whites at least).  If I had a basement nuc, I’d set it off when they come for whats mine.

        Another good reason to vote for Trump — elect him, and the entire uniparty will do everything they can to torpedo him.  Not only will the media be interested in abuses of federal power again, they’ll start worrying about the economy, too (funny how all those “ZOMG gas is $3 a gallon!” stories disappeared all at the same time, at about 12:01 AM on 20 January 2008).  Watch how fast raising interest rates becomes the *only* policy if it will trigger a “Trump recession.”

        Karl Denninger thinkshealthcarewill fold this house of cards:“In the most-recent Treasury Statement (which is canonically correct when it comes to government spending) this fiscal year to date Medicare and Medicaid have spent $1,034,867 (millions); that is, $1.035 trillion. The entire government spent $2,869,374, so this amounts to more than one-third of the total, 36% to be exact.Last year to the same point in the fiscal year these two programs consumed $950,861.That is, this fiscal year spending increased 8.83% on a comparable period basis.Last full fiscal year (September 2014-2015) said spending rose 9.25%.The prior fiscal (September 2013-2014) said spending rose 6.63% and the year prior to that it rose 5.74%.There has been no “decrease”; in point of fact it has accelerated by approximately one third in the last two years over the previous two!…This rate of acceleration will, as I have repeatedly pointed out, bankrupt the Federal Government within the next administration’s term. It will in fact exceed all current federal spending within the next 10 years. Neither of these events will actually come to pass because you cannot have a government when you can’t pay the light bill in Washington DC.”

        There are two fears.  The first being the one you describe, which is in their opinion less likely.  The second scenario is the opposite of the first.  Its low interest rates forever (for multiple decades at least).  This is the situation that Japan is in.  They have a humongous debt and a massive dependent elderly population which makes no interest on its massive savings.  Europe also has a huge elderly population, and government bonds from governments like Germany have negative interests rates meaning that you lose money if you buy on (except if rates go lower where the value of the bond with a less-negative yield increases).  We’re facing low low rates here too.  The 10 year US govt bond is about 1.6% right now.  Our rates may not be as low yet because our demographics are a bit better and our government is taking on new debt where I don’t believe Germany and other negative rate nations are, at least not in significant amounts.Among the dangers of low interest rates are that it is hard for those in retirement to get a safe income from their savings.  This has led to inflation in the cost of financial assets such as stocks because bonds will not pay enough (company valuations have gone up even as profits have gone down over the last year or so).  Pension funds from states and private companies are in big trouble because their projections are for significantly better returns than they will be able to get in a low interest rate environment.There was a ton of money around looking for safe income even before the financial crisis.  One of the causes of the financial crisis was huge demand by pension funds and other retirement related funds for mortgage backed securities, which led to a juiced up supply which led to the price crash (which led to the liquidity crunch which was the proximate cause of the difficulty).You see a lot of demands for stimulus – building roads and bridges to “create demand” as a cure for low interest rates, to boost the economy.  This is what the Japs have been doing for 30 years with no success so far.  The low interest rates are the result of a middle class global world which did not reproduce in adequate numbers and so has no one willing to borrow its savings to invest in the future.

        I’ve been keeping fairly detailed financial records since I got married half a decade ago and the government’s inflation numbers are a fiction. The biggest expenses in our household (like most?) are housing, healthcare and food. At least in those areas, inflation is sure as hell not running at 1-2% a year. “Stuff” or consumer goods, have not experienced the same cost growth, but I don’t need new clothes or furniture or a television the way I need to eat and live somewhere. I’ve kept costs relatively flat, but only by becoming increasingly savvy and careful as a shopper. Everything is now a game of me against the stores/utility companies/laundromat/bank. We’ve reexamined every dollar spent and cut our standard of living to control costs. I anticipate more in that vein to come,

            Right, inflation is nil unless you have to do things like feed your family, heat your home, maintain your health, educate your children, drive, and buy or rent shelter. You know, little “discretionary” items like that. Pffft.

                Yep, licensing. And the FDA. Right now we have both, plus the plague of lawyers, a great redundancy of costs. Then there is insurance, which soaks up one third of the bill. Anyone who actually wishes to understand what quality health care would cost under liberty needs only to appraise veterinary fees. Not cheap, nor should they be, but quite affordable. It’s pretty much what health care cost in 1950.

        The bankers seem confused about how the glorious revolution is coming along with an impressive list of pin headed; know it all, ivory tower, super double doctorate idiots miffed over wha, wha, what to do. The bankers used to use the very polite term “Policy Headwinds” when referring to gov policy, tax rates, over regulation, etc.I don’t blame the bankers. This is solely the fault of the US Congress whose job it is to coin the money. It keeps borrowing. What is a banker going to do, not lend? The one sure way to fix it is the scariest of all. It means gov will have to let go. It will have to step aside. It will have to admit that it is a problem and that free men are better served by being at liberty.Because, you see, there is nothing that isn’t regulated, taxed, controlled, prohibited or outlawed. Name one single thing, name it. Gov wanted top down authoritarian command and control over every last teeny weeny little aspect of everything on earth and expects the robust dynamism of a highly mobile, risk it all, entrepreneurial, all I need is a shot economy. You can’t have both. You and your rules suck ass m-f-ers.Give us our land back, throw the federal register on a bonfire and six months, one year tops, the largest, fastest economic explosion in the history of the world would be off like a rocket raising the standard of living for everyone on the entire planet, AGAIN. Screw them. I guess I’ll just get more ammo against the day they make that one rule too many.

        History is replete with plate-spinners.. who just want to get by one more day.  We are there now, but the catch is, the rest of the industrial world is right there with us.  Think about it…  there is no industrial nation in better financial shape than the U.S.   And that is our saving grace.The interconnected global economy is historic and so far all the plates are still spinning.  The cynic says, sooner or later, something will happen and it will all fall to pieces.  The grifter elite are ok with that really… they appear to just want to get theirs and take care of their friends… and that sets up any leader in the world, who honestly tries to take the hit and fix their system, the fool… because they will endure pain for their country while the rest of the world spins their plates.  No, I do not know the answer, but history rhymes.

        IIRC re the French Revolution, ‘everyone’ in the elite of the ancient regime knew that serious financial reforms were need and worked diligently to have some other group than theirs give up their privileges for the good of the nation.  French intellectuals being French intellectuals, indignant indictments and ponderous polemics abounded against this or that (actual) abuse.  But the French being the French, nobody actually was willing to give up any of their own ‘privileges and immunities’.  The net result was that they all effectively/collectively agreed to kick the can down the road.  This worked until it didn’t.Seems like that is where we are now too.
