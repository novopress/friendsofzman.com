        Anyone with a rudimentary acquaintance with military strategy knows that longer supply lines translates into less effective operations.  Let’s go back to the American Revolution, shall we?  Great Britain had the world’s largest navy and one of its largest armies, both of which had been honed to near perfection after a century of wars against France and Spain.  Regardless, it had to send those forces halfway around the globe to put down an insurrection instigated by a few thousand ill-equipped, inexperienced militias.  GB eventually lost.  The American Civil War was won by the Union because it had massive superiority in numbers and industrial capacity, yet the Confederacy strung the Union out for four years, because it was fighting on its own turf and could disrupt Union supply lines at will, at least until it literally ran out of men and money.  WW I found a stalemate along the front where neither side could hold on to its advances because it would run out of supplies if it advanced too far.  WW II same.  Fall Blau was unsuccessful because Germany could not keep its forces supplied over the vast Russian countryside that it initially overran with ease.  Japan could not keep its forces supplied over the vast distances of the Pacific once the juggernaut USA got its industrial capacity up to snuff.  It’s is always logistics and rarely tactics that wins wars between peers.  Russia can keep its forces supplied over its home territory, whereas Ukraine must rely on the receipt of weapons from the other side of the globe, viz., the USA.  At some point, the logistics will determine the outcome, unless the feckless neocon traitors holding power in DC overstep the red lines that Russia has set out.  At that point, there will be a huge and unpleasant reckoning.

The American people are 19 times more likely to see Washington, not Moscow as the problem.

        The problem is the decaying empire this time has nuclear weapons. Will they get used? I don’t know. I actually trust the Russians to behave rationally. But I wonder about our own political class. I’ve been following the Youtube videos on Judge Napolitano’s channel of both Douglas Macgreger and Scott Ritter. I find both men to be far more believable than our MSM. Russia will clearly win this conflict. My only concern is if our political class can stand the humiliation. Or if they will act irrationally like spoiled children and use nukes.

        I will play Devil’s Advocate. Everything is working out fine for the Regime. The drastic fall in living standards? Part of the Klaus Schwabian plan for “you will own nothing, have no privacy, and eat the bugs bigot!” Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos all approve. Any move to oppose this is easily crushed as a “coup” and “threat to our democracy!” — like more open-ness on Twitter. As Yuval Hariri noted, “there are billions of useless people” who need to be eliminated. Call it the ultimate corporate reduction in force.[Elon Musk needs motivated engineers and skilled trades to build stuff to get to Mars and they don’t work for an extra ration of cockroaches, so he’s on the outs, there is a move to strip him of his citizenship and deport him and seize his companies among Democrats. Bezos, Gates, and Soros already have their money and seem intent on other things.]There is now a new enemy with endless amounts of money to be spent on military-adjacent stuff. Our new army of transgenders, homosexuals, and lesbians is working out fine. When/if the Ukrainians face defeat (Putin’s national address postponement seems as if signaling something big beforehand), no problem. War in Serbia, with the US simply sending troops to Ukraine to fight Russians … along with “advisors” already there. Those Patriot missiles require a crew of 90 to service and operate it so there will be Americans, and Americans to protect Americans, and Americans to protect Americans protecting the Patriot crews. Already the Pentagon is not opposed to strikes deep inside Russia as they say they “fear no escalation” and the mood in DC is that Russia is a paper tiger. Not very good, can’t strike back, won’t use nukes no matter what and with an inferior air force and air defense system. There are plans galore to “decolonize” Russia by breaking it into sections after Putin is removed. If necessary there will be a draft and the Regime will hoover up every White guy under 60 to send to Ukraine. And/or use immigrants. Unlimited manpower and disposable too. Dems and RINOs are proposing instant family citizenship for immigrants who join the military.IMHO, this Regime attitude is based on Putin’s seemingly endless desire to be an accepted part of the West and unwillingness to respond to any provocation. Much like Rod Dreher really, really wants to be part of the Left, Putin scares no one, least of all the Biden people who have nothing but contempt for Putin. The Regime is not afraid at all of Putin. Not in any way.Note I don’t agree with the Regime in the slightest, but that seems to be their take.

        “The Global American Empire is not dying because it has run its course, but because it is run by stupid people who keep making critical errors in vitally important areas of imperial business. Adams famously said of democracy that it “wastes, exhausts, and murders itself.” Perhaps this is true of democratic empires and America is now in the murder itself phase.”“Stupid” is a cope and misdirection. It’s murder, deliberately planned. The tell is the demand for “unconditional surrender” and the corresponding designation of the foe as an entirely “evil” entity, Satan, Hitler, Putler. Both a characteristics of the mindset of a certain desert Tribe.

                That’s our 20th Century revision of cyclical theory.It’s a chicken-and-egg question; do ambitious outgroups cause, or do they merely exploit, dynasty collapse?The unique history of the West is pinned on one Book.My version of that history says “We wrote it, They stole it,” and that the entire Book is a chronicle of the back-and-forth between a whitish majority and their would-be rulers, contesting the direction.A unique irritant, as in the pearl of an oyster.  Will no one rid us of these meddlesome priests?Is there a driver over the cliff,  or is Enlightenment democracy correct and inescapable.  I, for one, would like how long /our/ team of horses would last.

            No , we are being done in by the puppets of the WEF type group that has sized absolute control of the west and sees the people of the west as ants at their picnic. I don’t know if the CCP is their servant of master, but seem to have a big part in it because everything from the one part system to the social credit score and media manipulation they use to control their people is clearly coming to the west.The CCP will own all this useful land once we are gone.Covid was the takeover, and they may not be using it but all the emergency powers they granted themselves have never been rescinded.

                The American electorate is the CCP.  Humanity isn’t majority winners.  It’s majority losers.  Losers are envious.  Losers with ballots use them to box check thieves to steal from the winners.  It’s that simple.  We are the enemy of ourselves.

        “I wonder whether the extreme egalitarianism of the elite universities is a kind of defense mechanism to avoid dealing with the ways in which they are betraying their students. If you tell your students, ‘check your privilege, you shouldn’t expect to do more than the average person …’ that is a way for the elite University to absolve itself of its responsibility to see that its graduates become leading members of our society.” – Peter Thiel discussing the stagnation of the society and inability of Universities.In the same talk he acknowledges that you cannot go back to classical liberalism because there are aspects of it that have failed and we have to move. Take whatever good may be in it, but accept it has failed and move on to the next political organizing principles is his recommendation. Encouraging to hear it spelled out.

        False assumptions on both sides produced this war.The initial Russian blunders ensured the war was going to be a mess.  But the greenzone junta’s response ensured the conflict was going to be both global and intractable.Over the summer, I began thinking that a possible center-of-gravity in this now-global war was the German middle class, its political power.  Once the burghers freaked over the war’s price tag, I imagined, they would say Enough.But this was before the US and the UK re-conquered Germany.And now it seems that the German secret police have staged their own Jan6 farce and will use this to suppress any non-globalist movement or party.Maybe the Germans are not going to be allowed to vote their way out of this.  Which seems the case in every corner of the West.The UK is conquered, moribund.  The German regime is  behaving like the greenzone’s retarded little brother.  Macron has years left in office, and is short.  Italy?  Meloni often sounds good, but she is still going along with the war.  And expecting anything from Italy — especially from a woman who smoked cloves and listened to the Violet Femmes as a girl — is a fool’s errand.I don’t know how long the spillover from this war can be kept out of politics,  But my sense is that every state security apparatus inside GAE will be used to that end.

            The Germany coup story is a farce. They breathlessly reported that 25-50 individuals were going to take over the German government? In a country of 83 million? This appears to be a way to smear the AFD political party so to have cause to ban their participation in the parliament.
Seems they are taking cues from the J6 fiasco. They really pushed the unbelievable idea that precious “Democracy” nearly fell that day. If selfie-talking Ohio grandmas and a guy LARPing as a Viking had any chance to take over, then we didn’t have a country worth defending.

        The way to save the US dollar in the face of petrodollar erosion looks pretty straightforward to me: blow up the Euro and force the Europeans into using the USD. Considering the fecklessness and incompetence of European leadership this shouldn’t be all that hard to do. I’m sure somebody up there in the globohomo hierarchy has already thought of it if I have. This probably buys the USD another half century or so, kind of like the last two resets did. It also moves the world closer to one world currency/one world govt, which I read somewhere is important to somebody or another.I try to give globohomo a little credit for strategic thinking sometimes. They can’t be 100% stupid wrong 100% of the time. Nobody can. Well, Joe Biden can, believe it or not, the historical record is there to back that up. But for the most part, even complete idiots luck into doing the smart thing some percentage of the time.There is no peace party in the US. The former peace party, the Democrats, just passed the largest military spending bill in the nation’s history. Civnat normiecon appears to be fully on board with supporting “freedom” and “democracy” in Ukraine against the Putin/Hitler. Thus there will be no domestic impediment to globohomo’s plan for Ukraine. Whatever it is. If they have one at this point other than “throw money.”

        Why do the ink-stained wretches of the MSM insist on using the “democracy” tag instead of the “republic”  to describe the US of A? Most certainly we have devolved into a cluttered mess of Mob rule that properly describes a democracy….corruption,immorality,perversion, habitual lying. But occasionally I would like an absentminded know-it -all wretch to use the REPUBLIC term just for old times sake.

            I spent around 50 commenting years correcting “democracy” to “republic”, only to concede, now, that the republic is dead and has been dead for a while. All our present ills are the result of democracy, which is the proper name for the regime we live under.Further, once you accept that the republic is dead, you can move on to understanding that it was the permissiveness and reckless libertarianism to which the republic gave birth and then to which it gave shelter which facilitated its overthrow.In the event that the nation is saved, the government which does the saving will not be bound by the 18th-century limits on power which killed the Old Republic.

        Forget armaments, Putin is turning this into a “balance sheet” war. The West has huge amounts of government and, to a lessor degree, corporate debt. It simply can’t handle high interest rates via inflation on that debt, especially if that inflation is caused by higher energy costs.Higher energy costs that you pay to someone else for energy means that it costs you more to produce the same amount of goods and services. Inflation up, interest rates up but “real” GDP steady or lower. Doesn’t work with high debt.You’re screwed in that situation if debt-to-GDP is higher than 100%. We’re at 125%.Say before, you had 2% inflation and 2% real GDP growth for 4% nominal. Let’s also say that you had debt to gdp of 75%. If you keep interest rates at inflation – 2% – your interest expense was 1.5% of GDP.Now, let’s say that inflation rises to 6% and real GDP growth drops to 1% for a nominal growth of 7%. Great, nominal GDP is growing quickly. But now, let’s say that debt to gdp is 125% and interest rates are still at inflation or 6%. Now, your interest expense 7.5%.Your nominal GDP rose from 4% to 7% or three percentage points. But your interest expense rose from 1.5% to 7.5% or six percentage points. You just blew out your budget.Look at the sovereign and corporate balance sheets. The higher interest rates haven’t really hit yet b/c of debt duration but it’s coming. The West can’t afford high inflation for very long if interest rates are allowed to rise to the level of inflation. And the only way to avoid that is yield curve control, i.e., central banks buy the bonds. But that cause currency issues.Of course, you can always just crush demand via a recession to bring down inflation but that destroys budgets as well.

            Preaching to the choir here.  The biggest issue of our lives is the one issue that nobody (including investment advisors!) is talking about… The massive million kiloton hydrogen bomb that is the U.S. debt market.  (And of course the Europeans and Japanese).  The U.S. government became insolvent around early to mid-Obama.  Under the current debt structure it cannot continue as a going concern without inflation as far as the eye can see.

                Ordinarily that would be correct.  But you would need a regime of austerity, not one that will create infinite PPP loans and various other vehicles as sedatives during the massive recession.  Covid was a dry run for this.  I’m sure they said “holy shit, why didn’t we think of this PPP stuff sooner?”

        “Can the petrodollar survive if the largest energy producers are comfortable dealing in alternative currencies?” –ZmanQuick trip down memory lane – remember how the establishment lost its friggin’ wig the last time something like this came even close to happening?  OPEC – the very name sent shivvers down our spine for decades.  The lines at gas stations were real, but the oversized reaction and narrative the establishment concocted to explain the oil embargo were not. It became a scarring, life changing event in the national psyche.DC presented it to the public as a comic book narrative of the Bad Saudis being greedy and simply price gouging the Good US when they had the chance.  In reality, Nixon had just closed the gold window, was expanding the bureaucracy with new agencies, and had further committed megabucks to Johnson’s welfare state. Inflation was on the rise and the Saudis realized they were being paid in depreciating dollars, so they demanded more dollars. A rational response (but very inconvenient and a grave challenge to the honor of our fiat system).DC went into hysterical overdrive and the environmental movement morphed from concern about environmental pollution to fretting over “oil dependence”.  New think tanks were born on the premise that America needed “energy independence”. (The very same energy independence Biden blithely threw in the trash last summer because the environmental movement has since morphed yet again to its current anti-oil/anti-civilization stance.) Energy-independence is now yesteryear’s agenda.To this day, left doors on all government buildings remain locked as Jimmy Carter’s little souvenir of all this nonsense.Now that inflation is pretty much going to be baked into the American cake for the immediate future (and more importantly as treasuries lag behind the inflation rate), it’s not irrational for countries to look around for alternatives. Biden’s Embargo is hastening the encouragement of new trade blocks to develop. That these nations can avoid color revolutions and mandatory gender confusion for their next generation is all the more incentive.What the DC children in charge don’t seem to have a handle on is the very same disdain that they have for heritage America is the same disdain other nations have towards them.

            The last two threats to the petro dollar were Saddam Hussein in 2002 and Gaddafi in 2008.The GAE neutralized both with ease.Don’t kid yourself. Its military might that ultimately underlies the petrodollar system.  And even today the US is the most powerful military on earth.Losing Ukraine would be a blow to,US prestige – which is why the regime was idiotic to go all in on it.  But even with such a blow the GAE’s military would remain the worlds strongest and the petrodollar system intact, if less predominant than it is now.The bottom line is that no country has the military capability to guarantee a Saudi Regime, as the GAE does.  And they are the key to empire because their oil reserves gives them unlimited pricing power in global oil markets.The most likely result of a GAE defeat in Ukraine would be a regime change in DC that resulted in serious people being in charge and their securing the dominance of the GAE, if for only their own preservation.The analogy here is the Roman Empire – where decadence in the imperial city led to revolt and replacement by a faction of competent military leaders.  That happened six times in the west before its fall and close to a dozen more times in the byzantine east.

        One thing I distinctly remember during the start of the war was the blowback from D.C. towards India for not signing onto the sanctions.  One day, as I recall, we threatened to sanction India for not sanctioning Russia.  Someone in D.C. surely miscalculated.  I couldn’t imagine them thinking that India would do this.  It’s a poor country where people still starve to death.  They’re not all dying of diabetes from stuffing their faces like Americans.  Also, it showed the cold indifference of the U.S. towards a country with a billion people, clear on the other side of the world, that just wanted to improve its standard of living.Germany, on the other hand, is committing suicide faster than any place I can think of.  And for what?   It’s not just about Ukraine.  The Greens in charge over there find this to be the perfect time for an “energy transition” from actual fuels to unicorn dust.  Germany, having a semi-autistic culture, actually has true believers on the eco-sh..t.  A lot of Europe has these people.  The Netherlands may be even worse.The coming global debt crisis will hit, Europe, North America and Japan at the same time.  It will be unprecedented.  Too many people were promised too much in the good times and that bill is coming due.

            The Arrogance of America is so overwhelming that the assumption is that other Nations will succumb and like it. The Stupidity of Biden upbraiding the Saudi’s for insufficiently celebrating sodomy and charging their Crown Prince with murder is stunning. The clowns are then upset when Joe goes to Riyadh to beg for oil and is greeted by an uber at the airport and a fist bump when he gets to town, before being to to go fuck himself. Contrast that with the reception of Xi. The king, not MBS but the King, an old and infirm man who walks with a cane, went to the airport to meet Xi, the Chinese plane had an honor guard, cannons  and a flypast when he landed, painting the sky with the colors of the Chinese flag.The West has fought, and handily won the Ukraine war in the media,Russia has fought it militarily, economically and Geo-politically.The world has moved on. Buchanan’s Death of the West is proving prophetic.

            “One day, as I recall, we threatened to sanction India for not sanctioning Russia. Someone in D.C. surely miscalculated. I couldn’t imagine them thinking that India would do this. It’s a poor country where people still starve to death. They’re not all dying of diabetes from stuffing their faces like Americans. Also, it showed the cold indifference of the U.S. towards a country with a billion people, clear on the other side of the world, that just wanted to improve its standard of living.”Agree with everything you’ve written. The general problem is the US government has nothing to offer for the concessions it asks for. This is about quid pro quo — there’s got be some quo for the quid. You can’t be hegemon simply on the basis of a fading dollar nor on the basis of aircraft carriers, nuclear missiles, white phosphorus, and fighter aircraft. Especially when others can match your military capabilities, if not trump them. The US offered India nothing. Likewise, the US offered Saudi nothing — but expected the Saudis to keel over. The US is running on empty and bluster and bravado. As Z man remarked a year and a half back, Biden is the death mask of the dying regime

        Now the neocons are attempting to start conflict in Serbia again to put more pressure on Russia.    Putin should just call Benjamin Netanyahu and tell him that the tribe had better call off its’ vassals.    Tell him if Serbia is attacked that will well and truly start WWIII.
Also let him know that if the nukes start flying, not to worry,  Russia has saved a few for them.

        I cannot recommend enough the three part conversation that Dr. Michael Vlahos and Col. Douglas Magcregor had several days ago covering the reality of the Ukraine War, what does it mean for grand strategy and what can be done to fix it.
https://youtu.be/GhA1yofpkMg
The overlap between the discussions on DR boards like this one and a few others (hi Sev) is remarkable. Well worth the time.

        The regime seems to be making itself as grotesque as possible, to both foreign and domestic partners as well as enemies.The worship of Africans is the first thing. Fielding a team of all Africans does not endear the West to the rest of the world.Sticking LGBT in the Gulf’s face is another mistake. It’s now a rallying point for the entire world. Nobody, from Russia, to Qatar, to China, to India, to Afganistan, to Black-as-Coal Africans, wants the perverted Western sexual morality. Xi Jinging doesn’t want to have sex with men in dresses anymore than the Taliban do. They were willing to play along when it was vague, basic things like “human rights”, “womens safety” etc. The aggressive homo worship and especially the gender bending stuff is pushing the whole world away from them.Finally, the world is not interested in the green agenda either. Narendra Modi doesn’t want to spend his free time collecting firewood to heat his house. Everybody wants cheap resources so that they can make stuff and sell stuff, simple as.They’ve also more or less declared war on their own citizens. We’ve been over this many times. Many Western people go along with it, but many don’t. The fact the jingoism around Russia fell so flat this time, compared to Iraq 20 years ago, shows a big shift.I wouldn’t count them out though. America is crazy, but it’s still rich and powerful. Even if the pan-Asia multipolarity happens, we (average white people) will still lose. They don’t care about us. We’re in a lose-lose situation. Our material standard of living is probably much better with a strong, but crazy America.

            When Xi traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet the King and Mohammed bin Salman that might be marked as the beginning of the end for the West.   Xi stated  that  he intends to pay for oil in Chinese currency and the Saudis were receptive.
It will take a little time to make that happen administratively but the writing is on the wall.  They went to war in Iraq and Libya to maintain the petro dollar.  Maybe they will attack Saudi Arabia.   Wouldn’t it be funny if the idiots managed to force Saudi Arabia and Iran into an alliance.

                george1,
Good analysis on SA &amp; China. Lots of moving parts behind the geopolitical curtains these days wrt the world shifting to a multipolar stance.
A good book to read for details and insight into Middle Eastern cultures and traditions is, “The Arab Mind” by Raphael Patai. As with all scholarly works, there are some blind spots, hits and misses, but it is still a decent overview of the sociocultural factors that affect the region.

That’s not any crazier than forcing Russia, China, and India into one, yet here we are.
What gets really funny is when you start talking about NATO members such as Hungary and Turkey.

            We are in this mess because the only thing we thought about was our material standard of living. We needed to maintain it at any cost  – increase the debt and import future taxpayers to keep the Soc. Sec ponzi afloat to avoid lowering benefit payouts.The best thing to happen to us is sooner than later having serious issues with our standard of living. The bigger issue is our homelands have been invaded, internal tribes with a blood libel against us are emboldened and empowered. The very survival of our posterity is at stake.A lower standard of living and being made last in line for jobs because of our race should wake us up. If it doesn’t, then our ancestor’s fight for survival in the cold and scarce so we could be here was for nothing. We’ve been maintaining and sustaining for a long time. It is time to re-awaken our survival instinct and raise our aspirations and the expectations we have for ourselves.

                PeriheliusLux:  While it may not affect a majority of commenters here, from what I’m reading a large number of Americans already have a lower standard of living.  And White heterosexual men have been last in line for jobs for some time now – it’s just that the GoodWhites and POX are explicit and triumphalist about it today.  Older White men are dying or taking early retirement.  Young White men are opting out of the entire system of faux jobs and blue-haired landwhales.A people who will not defend their own children from sexual predators has no future.  A people who allow their children to be taught to hate their genetics, their ancestry, their culture, and their natural sexuality is already dead.  There is no great ‘awakening’ coming.  Those who are aware of reality – perhaps 10% at the outside – will remain a tiny minority.  Aspirations are for people with a hope for the future, and children for whom they wish to build one.

                    There are, more than ever, “two Americas.”My friend across the street, an old Japanese guy obsessed with ’50s American culture (as they were), recently died. In his last few years, mostly because of the failure of his pension to match inflation, he’d had to sell the antique cars and guitars he’d bought new and planned to will to friends and relatives who’d value them. Again and again he’d cut back, but it was never enough to pay the obligatory bills while still having anything like a normal life. He had to give up. Then of course he died almost immediately.A few days ago an actual person, not Blackrock or whatever, bought his house—sight unseen (except photos), at full asking price, for twice the assessed value of mine, and mine is very obviously worth much more. His is a plain, characterless, one-middle-class-man urban house with a slightly oversized garage. The price was *psychotic*, beyond even a “professional couple”‘s ability to pay.My new neighbor hasn’t arrived yet, but I know he’s not one of us, and there are going to be problems.

                “increase the debt and import future taxpayers to keep the Soc. Sec ponzi afloat to avoid lowering benefit payouts.”Can you point me to these ‘future taxpayers’? Because the 85 IQ 5 foot tall genetic slurry mud goblins steaming across the border are NOT and likely will never be taxpayers.Is there a secret stream of Europeans pouring into the States I’m unaware of? No, they are not bright enough to consider anything past the next election cycle or two and the lefty Boomers in charge are happy to have their final moment in the sun.They will leave the dysfunctional broke AF wasteland to the Millennials &amp; Zoomers after they die because, ‘I got mine at least’. If these younger generations had a single brain cell between them they’d have lit the entire edifice on fire already but instead they are compliant serfs who will go down with the ship.Black Pill status for 12/14/22: Achieved!

                    Apex Predator –the next generation of taxpayers is their line and it is also what denialist cons tell themselves about the immigrants. I know people who say, “as long as they pay taxes!”Some of them do work and pay taxes and some of them work and do not pay taxes and some of them lay about and collect taxes. Any of them who work and send home remittances are paying taxes directly to the Wall St. banks and to the currency converters on both sides of the border.In any case, I think some of the managers were convinced that the way to keep Soc. Sec from going tits up was to import new tax payers who will rapidly breed even more taxpayers. How that will pan out when the heritage Americans who had far fewer kids  who now work the worthless jobs discussed yesterday we know. Too many mouths to feed even if you do have a printing press and digital helicopter drops.

                So true. In the multi-culti population dump that America is being fashioned into, about the only thing anyone has in common is the concern over one’s own standard of living.Unfortunately, in this growing population dump (as opposed to middle/working class society that creates wealth), one man’s SOL comes at the expense of another’s, once the books are balanced. (Or alternatively, it is “financed” by borrowing from the creative society’s future. Just put it on the tab!)  Meaning it is a zero sum game when the majority of population enters the useless eater category, to borrow Mustachioed One’s phrase.An improved  SOL is the magnet that pulls people here in the absence of several normal impediments a responsible country would have in place like a wall, proof of identity requirements, etc, to protect the existing society’s SOL and its capacity to produce future wealth. Basic preservation of a nation 101 stuff.I’m kind of surprised the government hasn’t started taxing social security as the next magic scam to keep the fairy dust plates spinning midair.

Neocons like Nuland will snap bones patting each other on the back while praising each other for having astronomically high IQ’s, but they have the common sense and judgement of an eggplant. Of course, my IQ score would be astronomically high if I took the test several times or found out what questions were on it.Unfortunately, were stuck with them. They’re like a virus that infects all politicians. They thrive on the misery of others and have caused a lot of it.

        Great stuff. Yes the fools, the fake elites running the West simply got several hundred thousand people killed in East Europe and destroyed our credibility as honest brokers.
Will Europe have enough self-preservation instincts to start aligning more with Russia? We’ll see.   Obviously Russia has been shocked and how rotten our leadership class is.
Americans and Russians should realize they have a lot in common. I’m talking old stock Americans. We need to find every way to connect with them. Like someone said, cowboys and cossacks have a lot in common.

        The number and magnitude of the West’s errors is truly astonishing.I recall early on in the conflict, Western “experts” were predicting that the sanctions would destroy the Russian economy, and the Russian people would overthrow Putin as a result.Instead, Putin is apparently more popular than ever; and the sanctions have not only *not* had the desired effect, they have— as Z-man points out— encouraged the formation of a Russia-China-India alliance, thereby strengthening the Russians, and threatening to end the hegemony of the petrodollar; while weakening the West. Without sufficient electricity, the deindustrialization of Germany is apparently very likely.Talk about your intentions backfiring! These people really do appear to be as incompetent and clueless as they seem. With leaders like that, the self-inflicted implosion of the GAE would appear to be inevitable.

        If this a world war, maybe clown world deserves credit for making war as larpy as possible. Otoh, the larpiness is what I can’t take. Sympathy to the soldiers and civilians actually getting blown up, but I want out of the asylum.Keep coming back to it: why not holy war for Zion? Isn’t that what’s at the heart of the new religion? Honestly, isn’t God now subject to the teachers? Isn’t nature just fodder for the debate club? People are so trapped in their own heads, so unable to resist the head-fuckery, that the metaphor might as well be real— except that it isn’t.I’m getting tired of thinking about this stuff because it takes increasingly greater effort to resist infection. Still do it because it’s fun, but it’s also playing on their court. Probably should get really serious about dripping out, lol.

            The people in charge have way too much time on their hands. If Ms. Nuland had to chop firewood, pump water, wash cloth diapers and cook from scratch she’d be much better off. If Chuck Schumer had to pitch hay, shovel manure, and hitch up a horse to a wagon and drive 10 miles (taking 2 hours one way) to converse with another man, he’d be better off. If AOC had to wash clothes in a tub of cold water and spend time weeding and watering a vegetable patch, and spend hours in a hot summer kitchen canning same, she’d be better off. Only when the things run out will there be change-

                Whether or not Chuck, AOC, et al would be better off doing those chores – I’m sure they would not think so.  As for the rest of us, there can be no debate whatsoever that we would be better off if they spent their time in manual labor.

        The public, with their unwavering belief in the regime’s credibility appears boundless. People you thought were rational creatures it seemed, almost overnight, plastered Ukrainian flags in their profiles. I have personally seen a few Ukie flags in the front yard of homes in my area. Now, one can surmise that some of those at private residences may have personal ties to the country, but rest assured that a few are there for the extra virtue points.It was naïve to think that after decades of proven deception told to the US public in the arena of foreign military operations and policy, the credibility would begin to show a few cracks. At least more skepticism and caution would be applied. But no. All it still seems to take is to repeat a few lines about “freedom-loving people”, or the magical incantation of “Democracy”, and most fall in line to send billions worth of armaments and financial aid to a country that 9 out of 10 couldn’t find on a globe with any proficiency. Even having a Secretary of Defense who sat on the board of directors for Raytheon, a defense contract company, did not raise much alarm.Instead of looking at these geopolitical situations with a critical eye, or at least a semblance of logic, the most effective retort is to accuse anyone not in lockstep with support for Ukraine as a Putin lover, or a possible commie.What positive results have occurred from the US response? A re-alignment of world powers in a rapidly changing multipolar world. India, China, and now more nations in the middle east are re-evaluating the emerging order. Biden, looking pathetic as he begs Saudi Arabia for more oil production, is this week hosting a number of leaders from African countries in an attempt to sway the tide of Chinese influence. We sold them arms to kill each other with; China builds roads and industry in their lands. Who looks like a better partner?Regional conflicts should remain just that. Regional. Small wars are preferable to world wars.

            If anyone needs a refresher course about Africa, view the film “Empire of Dust.” In the general case, third world leaders host competing nations or corporations, extract as much loot as they can, and resume being local warlords. They might allow a little token resource plundering and such just to keep up appearances. If they’re really stupid, they will allow a foreign nation to build a military base in their country. Even in the very best case, call it a successful occupation and/or colonization, the costs  to maintain an outpost of one’s empire are high. In part this explains why they rarely last. I wish China luck.

You yourself spoke about them already. They were the Georgia family that the regime crushed in the context of the Ahmaud Arbery case (the jogger, remember?).Here is the donation page that Leigh McMichael (Greg’s wife and Travis’s mother) has set up on Give Send Go in order to help with their legal expenses and Travis’s daughter upbringing and education.:https://www.givesendgo.com/McMichaeldefenseAnd here is a website published by her also with the help of some friends, where she tells their side of the story:https://mcmichaeltrial.com/

            Last report wrt weather was that winter had been somewhat mild and the the ground was not yet frozen solid enough.  Current predictions are for late December for ground freeze.  Until then, the Russians are enjoying a 10-1 kill ratio on the fronts.  This may be an exaggeration, but there seems agreement that Russian strength grows daily as Ukrainian strength declines steadily.  An attack postponed does not seem to be in Ukrainian favor.  One unknown is if USA will supply even more advanced weaponry.

            Some of the better analysts are now saying that the Winter offensive may not happen for reasons that the Z man has pointed out.   The Ukrainians keep sending massive amounts of troops and equipment that the Russians keep destroying.   This is especially true in Bakhmut.
Seeing this the Russians may be quite content to just let them keep coming.

                I think the Russians have struggled mightily to grasp what the West and by extension the Ukrainians are doing and why they are doing it, but they seem to be slowly adjusting. This Bakhmut trap is one example. The Russians pulled out of Kherson in order to create a similar trap, but reportedly the foreign legions in the south refused to go along so the Ukrainians did not send a big force into the abandoned areas.

                    Its funny that the Russians don’t recognize their own playbook.  They need to go to the archives and study how the Republican war effort in Spain went (which the russkie’s predecessors planned and carried out).  The same globalists are fighting for ukraine as were fighting there for democracy, w the same events: massive victories announced in the press while the front line retreats ever rearward

            In truth, you do care, and care deeply. It’s just that you don’t foresee any way to make a difference when the Deep State runs everything; including MSM, institutions, Big Tech, and all the woke corporations.But that is just defeatism, which is the Deep State’s best defense. Create enough despair and the dirt people will stay on the couch.Don’t give them that easy victory. You have two jobs now. First is to simply survive the Crazy and the coming Chaos. Second is to fight back on circumstances and ground that is favorable to you. Exploit being the nobody that nobody sees coming. That is how you should evince your anger.

        Nuts &amp; bolts.Both Russia and Ukraine have enormous natural resources (energy, mineral, and agricultural) that, if stolen and exploited by the West, could produce a revenue stream sufficient to forestall the sovereign debt crises of many profligate Western economies. In other words, if the Russians win in Ukraine, DC and the EU will not be able to avoid bankruptcy when it comes time to refinance short term sovereign debt. This explains why the RINOs are committed to the war too.So what happens when Russia wins and the dominoes start falling? Europe will crater first (largely because the US has set them up to fail first). The ensuing chaos in the EU will become a harbinger of what is to befall the US later. Change in political leadership will the least impactful consequence because the new bozos will just be closet versions of the old bozos. But real hardship will return, and with it will come a revival of survival of the fittest. Which is a good thing.What can go wrong? Brandon might stupidly start WW3 and if the nukes start flying, you really, really don’t want to be near a big city. Just sayin’.

        Were it only high energy prices, but a healthy nation on solid economic footing and a population committed to itself.
Throw on top of it mass immigration, of people the Word Cup is exposing as hostile to the nation that feeds and shelters them, a dire balance sheet situation and you have a set of nations that could be moving from a cold multi-ethnic civil war to a full throttle multi-ethnic civil war as mass material deprivation sets in and sovereign bankruptcy hits at the same time.
The West isn’t committing suicide, it likely already has.

                It’s worth mentioning that rioting at (or outside the pubs during) a football match (that’s “soccer” for us Americans) is far from unusual in Europe and Latin America. Not sure about the rest of the globe.

            It is very true, what you say here.I live in Great Britain. Giver (for better of worse) of the Industrial Revolution. Provider-to-the-world of minds like John Harrison, Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell and Robert Hooke; of leaders like Alfred of Wessex and Major-General Charles Gordon; of scholars like The Venerable Bede…Doesn’t matter that much now, though. Not amongst the spiritually demotivated English, nor amongst the many darker-skinned invaders. Very sad indeed. It is amazing what can be done with a devoutness and belief in one’s people, one’s country.Indeed, if only the problems were simply material. So what? I have to turn my heater down and wear a jumper, so it goes. Seems like modernity is going to run itself into a wall at some point. We’ve had it too good, for too long. Perhaps the harshness of reality will marshal many of the plebs back to common sense; probably too much to ask.The World Cup is interesting to me only in-so-far as I used to watch it and now I do not. I was not surprised that there was much knee-taking from the spiritually hollow “English” football team.

                We also fought two wars against your tyranny loving shithole island. We still have the remnants in that tyrannical shithole to the north. If oy we were strong enough to eliminate that crap hat back in the 1800s. Why we wasted blood and treasure fighting with your dumbasses in the 20th century escapes me. The Europeans who stayed in the continent are good for nothing but eternal wars and destruction. We should cut you off entirely except our bullshit leaders in dc and nyc still have a hard on for your london bankers. The sooner you vassals are cut off entirely the better for true Americans.

        If the Russians conclude no negotiated peace is possible, the gloves would have to come off – whatever that entails.  The only hope would be for the EU to tell the gay american empire to go pound sand and work out a deal.  Unfortunately, they seem as determined to commit hara kiri as this government.
I guess it’s just going to come down to how much more the various populations in the west are going to put up with.  Based on what’s going on around here, it looks like a lot more, sadly.

Western populations will put up with anything and everything until the electricity goes out and grocery store shelves are empty. If Big Bro can manage those two things, then he can stay in power and carry on the drag show.
But he can’t manage those two things.
Still, FedGov is good for another ten years, max.

                I would think at some point there would be a disconnect of sorts between the red states/areas and the empire proper.  Local GOPers had an incentive to keep the scheme going since that kept open the possibility of higher office (however remote), but with Federal positions either sealed off or being glorified appointments the state GOP offices gain nothing from being part of the national.  Nothing so brave as secession, but still, might be interesting.

        I followed the link in the article discussing the trick. I followed a related story at the bottom to a China ambassador to the WTO saying the US a destroyer of the global trading system. The story referenced the US WTO Ambassador, Maria Pagan. So, as always, I like to see who is working for the US. I looked her up and on her Ambassador’s page is a list of her recent statements.One was a statement on the second anniversary of the, “murder”, of George Floyd. It prattled on about how blacks in America are victims of racism and went into self immolation about how we can’t spread democratic values if we don’t take care of our own systemic injustices … …Pagan was born and raised in Puerto Rico. She is another immigrant who has made it into the upper echelons of America, yet denigrates it on the world stage. Perhaps the most stupid thing we have done is elevate foreigners who have no gratitude or appreciation or sense of duty and fealty to the nation where in a generation they made it to the top. We have people with at best dual loyalties as ambassadors representing our country. Meanwhile, we confront China and Russia. While their elites certainly have rivalries, they at least are Chinese and Russian and must feel some deep love and loyalty for their homeland and their people.Reserve a slot at the 24×7 guillotine factory for Ms. Pagan and the St. George eulogizers she pays with our money. Imagine going to a negotiation with China after you have ceded the moral standing of the nation you represent and he then tells you that you are a destroyer of law and order after you have called your nation a racist murderer. What if this isn’t stupidity, but Pagan and her ilk work for China?

            PeriheliusLux:  I would suggest you’re overthinking this.  To claim Pagan et al work for China seems to me equivalent to people labeling those of us who want the GAE to lose as lovers of Putin or ‘commies.’  Not that China wouldn’t seek to suborn such, but why on earth would they need to?  Pagan and her ilk hate and envy White men and White, western civilization.  Yes, their motivation really is that simple.  While I’m certain they’d have no scruples accepting foreign money, why would any other nation want to waste the funds trying to buy people who have no allegiance other than to themselves?  The enemies within are destroying things at quite a rapid clip all by themselves.

Now our neo-cons want another war with Serbia just for the hell of it.  Everyone is sick of this crap.

            Back in the spring I wrote a post about a report from the Royal something or other study in the relative military industrial capacity of the West versus the East. The guy pretty much nailed the situation perfectly. Contrary to Western assertions, Russia has a massive military industrial capacity. Much of it was a hangover from the Cold War, but it is clear that those old systems have plenty of use in this age. Artillery, for example, is critical to land warfare and the Russians have enormous capacity for producing artillery and artillery shells.
Here is the report:https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/return-industrial-warfare

                I read David Hackworth’s book long ago.  At the end he was adamant the western weapons systems were way too complicated, expensive, and unreliable.  At the time (1991?)  I didn’t really agree, in part because we still had a huge stockpile of unsophisticated Vietnam and Cold War era stuff.  Now – he’s absolutely right and we have no ability to produce big stuff such as tanks and artillery quickly and in quantity.

                    The Germans did the same thing. They were cutting edge in tank design, for example, but one really good tank is not better than fifty good enough tanks. The excuse the usual suspects make is that the Germans could not match the West in terms of volume, but that claim was only true later in the war.I think one reason the West has gone all in for super weapons is the shift from the draft to a volunteer army. By turning the military into a profession, they could select for the sorts of people they needed for the system they wanted to create. If you want a forward deployed military using cutting edge technology, you self people for those tasks. This set off a dynamic in which the weapons got more complex as the personnel became more highly trained.If the US army was relying on conscripts on two year enlistments as the primary recruiting tool, like you see in Russia, then it changes how the army configures itself. You need system that the typical conscript can operate. That also means you need leadership that can make the most of those conscripts using those systems. While the Russian army is primarily volunteers on contracts, like in the West, they came through the conscript system.

                        “The Desert Fox” Erwin Rommel, the German tank commander proved that tactics and strategy can be more decisive than technology during the WWII North African campaign against the Allied forces. Logistics and supply breakdown, not strategy, was the downfall for his Panzer division. Reading how his troops would scour a battlefield for parts after a battle was an interesting tidbit to learn. Also finding out that many of his tactics were taught at US tank command training.

                        Fifty good tanks will almost always defeat one or two excellent tanks because the excellent tanks only have two guns that can point in two directions while the fifty good tanks can approach from fifty different angles, many of which where the armor is quite thin.
Same argument applies to an F-22 versus a few dozen unmanned drones.

                        The veterans recounting WWII on YT told of Sherman tanks in the European theater against German Panzers of the time.  Something like 6 Shermans were lost for each Panzer killed.  However, USA had made something like 50k Sherman’s by the time of the invasion.
Had a HS teacher who was in the European theater, his job was to wash out the insides of the Sherman’s recovered and patch holes.  His story to a kid of 14 was a real eye opener.

                        Russia’s reduced conscription to 12 months. about 60% of the Russian Army are now professionals. Given the current ethnic mix enlisting in the US, I’d say the Russians have a more professional one.

                    There are reasons why our weapons systems are so complicated. One is we have a professional military with well-trained people who can operate and maintain cutting edge gear.Another is that we aim to supersede not only the existing generation of a weapon, but the next one as well. For example, the F-22/F-35 fighter aircraft were not only intended to beat 4th Generation aircraft like the Russian Su-30 and the Chinese J-10 (which looks suspiciously like an old Israeli Lavi that we helped develop), but they’re designed to beat the next generation as well, as evidenced by the Chinese J-20 and the Russian Su-57 Felon.Russian gear is designed to be operated and maintained by two-year conscripts. It’s tough and reliable. They don’t need a lot of tech reps to help fix seemingly unsolvable issues as we do.Another problem for us is the structure of our procurement process. In a sane, rational procurement process, the customer spells out what they want and hand it to the contractor who delivers. In our procurement process, the customer constantly changes their minds on what they want out of a new system or wants the impossible or, in the case of the F-35, tries to go a route intended to save costs that actually added to them.The F-35 should’ve been three different airplanes (or at least two) sharing propulsion, avionics, cockpit layout and basic configuration instead of compromising two of the airplanes for V/STOL capability for the Marines and Brits. The commonality between the three versions of the F-35 is a lot less than they intended and it’s hit us hard. Also, the maintenance program that helps maintainers find issues with the aircraft was a turd from day one and is being replaced, of course at great cost.There’s also the times we’ve done completely idiotic things. One example is the Sergeant York DIVADS mobile antiaircraft armored vehicle that couldn’t keep up with our Abrams tanks and Bradley APCs and couldn’t shoot down enemy aircraft at all.Another is the Navy’s stupid idea of “transformationalism” that became their new religion and led to a ship without a mission (the DD-1000 class) since we can’t afford the ammunition for the guns they carry (expensive paperweights) and a ship that can’t defend itself and is as reliable as a Fiat, the littoral “combat” ship known as the Little Crappy Ship. The Navy has run its cruisers and destroyers into the ground on silly show-the-flag ops and we’re not able to get hulls in the water like the ChiComs because our shipbuilding industry was never subsidized and its workforce was gutted because our ruling class told our young people that working a trade was beneath them.

                    The US has always been first and foremost a sea power, augmented by air/space power when it became available.There is no conceivable way the US could go toe to toe on its own in Europe or China with massive land armies.  It was never meant to. Logistically impossible.Now that NATO has hollowed itself out and member countries stopped meaningful contributions, this conflict is making it obvious that the US is not a mobile million man army.US is good at “The Assassin’s Mace”; when that fails, and mass troops are needed, the US comes up very short.(Thank god)

He then related about the time he pulled an A K out of a garbage heap; if fired just fine. Might have been BS, but…I can imagine what Hackworth would have to say about the current madness…

                The proof of that is all the equipment going to the front lines from Russia.   A few months ago we were told that Russia was out of tanks and that they could not quickly build more.  Well a lot of brand new T90 tanks are being shown on railcars in several locations as well as the fron.
It looks like Russia can build them in short order.

            It’s clear these two leaders are strong. The value power and their peoples. Biden and the rest of our betters value only power (money).It would be a mistake to think Putin or anyone else will save us. We can admire their presumed (I have no firsthand knowledge, so I presume) conviction to their people, but they have no such conviction for us.US citizens will be a side note if the US or dollar are ruined. As much as I hate to say it, maintaining our standard of living depends on continuing the depravity and the success of GH.Makes one wonder if he’s strong enough to stand on principle.

If more money is printed, the nominal value of each unit of that currency will go down, yes, but the value of the currency as a whole will remain unchanged.Now sending our currency overseas as part of an increasingly-vulgar money-laundering operation, forbidding domestic energy development, and sending critical manufacturing to potentially-hostile foreign countries doesn’t increase or maintain *our* standard of living at all.What *our* standard of living *is* dependent on is the efficient development of domestic energy, manufacturing, and agriculture. Period. Currency floating, trade “deficits”, military spending, and any other financialization of economic activity is at best bloat and at worst malignant grifting from the parasite class.

        “The question that must follow is can the economic and political model of the Global American Empire survive when it is confined to a minority of the world? The West is a little more than a tenth of the global population. How will the GAE function if the EU is in economic ruins? Can the petrodollar survive if the largest energy producers are comfortable dealing in alternative currencies? These are questions that get to the core logic of the American empire.”The answer is obvious: Nyet. The GAE is configured as a set of concentric circles: the USA at the core, then the first circle of vassals (Europe, Britain, Japan, maybe South Korea) that get some of the pickings once the tiger has had its fill, and then the rest of the world, which is dominated by the twin instruments of finance and military coercion. Once this configuration of core, buffer, and periphery no longer exists, then the core itself will be shaken to its foundations, as when Barad-Dur was when the ring fell into Mount Doom. Hmm, that’s a good analogy: the USA is Mordor, Russia is Gondor and China Rohan.The British Empire folded not only because of economic and military losses (though they think they won the war) but because of loss of credibility and the slow evaporation of the sterling area after WW2 (the predecessor to dollar hegemony).https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-13-0596-2_29The neo-con cabal that seems to create political and military policy appears to be completely composed of desk jockeys with little real-world experience. Their worldview seems to come entirely through the prism of the written word, rather than practical first-hand experience. One of the tropes, the catch-phrases, has been of Russia as a filling station. Alternatively, that it has an economy the size of Spain. Decades earlier, it used to be characterised by the US elite as “Upper Volta with rockets.

As much as I dislike FDR, it was truly a masterstroke how he facilitated the financial destruction of the British Empire along with destroying Germany as global competitors in one fell swoop.  Quite the ally the ole’ USA is.

                Quite. The US was instrumental in dismantling the British Empire. But an enduring myth in Britain is how it won the war against the Germans. Forget the inconvenient fact that food rationing stayed in place until 1954. Britain ended the war skint, its domestic population none too well fed, its colonies in open revolt, and the eclipse of pound sterling by the dollar. Its humiliating subservience to the US is described by the euphemism, “the special relationship.”

                    It amuses me that Churchill hated the Germans so much that he inadvertently destroyed the British Empire. I used to admire Churchill in my youth but the more I’ve learned the less respect I have for him. Now it’s pretty much disrespect in fact.The whole UK managerial class in the first half of the 20th century is almost as contempible as ours is now. The best of them died in WW I. Actually after I saw this on my screen, the best of them died in the endless colonial wars in the Victorian era.Empires seem to sow the seeds of their destruction for years before they actually fail. Their attempts to remain empire do nothing but hasten the inevitable end and in fact make it worse.

                Chet Rollins: FDR was devious but no great strategic genius.  Those who “facilitated the financial destruction of the British Empire along with destroying Germany as global competitors” were the international bankers and financiers, many of whose relatives first tasted power as part of FDR’s massive expansion and control of the federal government.

            WW I all but destroyed the old European world order. This included the “classical” gold standard. Great Britain was, for all practical purposes, no longer a going concern by 1918. No matter, they made a half-assed attempt to restore it in the 1920s but come the Depression, abandoned it for good. It’s an overlooked aspect of history that the prior war’s massive inflation ( = loss of purchasing power) directly led to other unhappy outcomes, like a disastrous German inflation, the ruin of an economy barely done with a major war, and the election as Chancellor of a certain mustachioed Austrian who in a few years’ time would briefly achieve world fame.It’s not a mainstream belief in economics, but some believe that UK’s resumed gold standard created serious imbalances which directly led to the Wall St. crash and the Depression.It’s one of those counterfactuals that historians will argue over, but a good case can be made that the Allies’ reparations imposed on Germany indirectly led to WW II with its doubled or tripled body count.

        here’s what i don’t get about the EU.   they are actively antagonising Russia, while counting on the US to protect them from reprisal.  once the US gives up on ukraine – and it will – the EU will be on its own.  and Russia will be looking for some heavy payback.   my point is, Russia is right there on the border of Eastern Europe, not half a world away like Afghanistan.   why pick a fight with such a formidable country that is so close?   you have to know the blowback is going to be very bad for the EU, and for what?  there is no upside for the EU in any conceivable scenario.

            We’re about a year on from the Russians crossing the border into Ukraine and they still haven’t been able to advance beyond east Ukraine. Still unable to take even Kharkov. Thus Europe has little to fear from a conventional Russian military invasion.Of course European leaders are incompetent, how could they be otherwise after decades of vassalship with the globohomo empire backstopping everything they do and shielding them from all consequences, like kids at college while Uncle Sugar across the atlantic pays the freight.But that’s a separate question from the military reality. Russia is obviously not capable of staging a large scale military campaign against the rest of Europe.

            It’s a Janissary thing. GAE selects ‘promising youths’ in client nations, raises them in its Totalist college culture, then returns them to their home country and installs them as rulers using EU, NATO and NGOs as Trojan horses. Thus, the leaders of countries such as Sweden consider the destruction of their own countries to be acceptable losses. Their true loyalty is to the Empire.GAE’s been doing the same thing to USA via the Ivy League colleges, to the point that Harvard and Georgetown are government service academies in all but name. Those kids aren’t learning to be proud of America there.

        The West thought they would provoke Russia in to a war that would drain Russian will and resources. What the West got was a prolonged war that is draining Western will and resources. It couldn’t happen to a nicer bunch of globalist pricks.My question is whether or not it will destroy the “Global American Empire”. I question is whether or not there ever was a “Global American Empire”? A Global Empire? Sure, I can by that, but an empire controlled by America and Americans? From where I’m sitting it sure does seem like the modern globalist villains are almost exclusively European flavored lollipops.

        These “wars” are really just Long Cons and the taxpayers are the marks. All of them were presented as existential threats to the US homeland blah blah – “we have to fight them over there so we don’t have to fight ’em here” etc. – I should have a dollar for each time my civnat friends said this to me.After a long spell of futility, we will just give up and go home. We leave some agents in a Green Zone (Iraq), a base camp to make trouble (Syria) or just go home entirely (Kabul/Afg.). Kiev will be the same, although there are some hot women and good clubs, so it could take a while longer to play out.The wars will end when the only buyer for our constant, huge emission of Treasury Bonds is the Federal Reserve.

            My guess is that this conflict is as much about forcing Russians to praise homos and trannies as it is about the huge amounts of money that are surely being grifted.  Just like our wars in the ME were as much about harassing the enemies of Israel as they were about enriching the military industrial complex.

                    There is substantial evidence that our ‘elites’ are far worse than being only pedophiles. New wars or other ‘crises’ spring forth to distract from those stories when they come out. Merely a cohencidence, to be sure.

                    Zman:  Per this Daily Mail story, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey claims Twitter’s government connections/subversion was largely due to Elliot Management, run by Jesse Cohn, buying a controlling interest and clearly steering the company’s direction.  Fwiw, Jesse Cohn’s photo strongly pings my gaydar.

            A democratic republic can work in a high trust relatively homogenous society, which America ain’t anymore.  So the USA is  now a confederacy of tribal grifters looking to fleece a dwindling band of suckers.
I for one welcome the decision to send Patriot missile batteries to the Ukraine.  There’s virtually no downside, none whatsoever.  Real forward thinking, long term strategery there.

            “Hey, I hear the government is now sending patriot missles to Ukraine, that will right the ship. Put in a few more billion dollar xmas gift cards in with it being the holidays and all. Russia seems real scared don’t they.”It’s unaccountable (to me, anyway) why the Russians haven’t yet activated some of their assets here. It would be a simple matter (for them or for anybody else) to shut down the entire power grid in one night:https://www.utilitydive.com/news/could-terrorists-really-black-out-the-power-grid/241192/And if I know that, then so does Putin. And he also knows that anybody–including him–can literally walk into “our” country. He might have to wear a mask. Or dress in drag. But we don’t have borders.It makes more sense to think of the situation as one in which FedGov is actively trying to destroy the USA rather than just making a mess of everything because they are stupid.What a sorry excuse for a government. And what a sorry excuse for a country.

        Does anybody read Niccolo Soldo (AKA Fisted by Foucault)? He has the opposite view: that America is in fact at its height of power. He writes that despite our own legion of problems, we are still much more powerful, wealthier, and more competent than our rivals China and Russia, and certainly moreso than India or Arabia. And that western dissidents now are akin to the ancient Romans who were grumbling about the growing number of slaves and barbarians living in their midst, circa 2nd century AD. We notice things, and can predict where this is all going, but we are living during an imperial high point, and have a long time before collapse happens.

            I think he’s right. But the rate of change isn’t in our favor and the second derivative is strongly negative.
Rome gave up messing with Germanic tribes early on and wisely left the Persians alone after a long period of hassles and the capture of an Emperor. They staggered on for a long time after. We seem to recognize no limits at all.

                Aside from their war-like proclivity and huge replacement numbers, there was simply no wealth in Germany of the time of the Romans.  Like Britain, it was a waste of their time and treasure to occupy and secure Germany.  The Roman Republic became great and then declined after they had taken most of the wealth of their occupied lands.  Reads something like the GAE if you think of it.

            I would argue that it’s less “strength” than the fact that no one wants to even bother challenging GAE, the brass ring of global dominance is there for the taking, but no one else is interested.  Lack of testosterone is a global issue apparently.

                Evil Sandmich:  Global dominance is not all it’s cracked up to be.  I always laugh when various boomers pontificate about Putin wanting to reoccupy eastern Europe and/or conquer western Europe – he’s far too smart to want the hassle.  Who needs political dominance when you can have economic dominance a la China?
I realize it’s ancient dead-White history, but I seem to remember something about avoiding foreign entanglements.  Most of us would have been happy and proud to have a safe, prosperous, homogeneous,  and stable home country.

            &gt; Romans who were grumbling about the growing number of slaves and barbarians living in their midst, circa 2nd century AD.If one is in a reading mood:  “The Final Pagan Generation” is startling in some similarities.We’re probably closest to the Roman Pagans in the fourth century who were looking in confusion as the ascendant Christians could topple pagan statues with impunity and the imperial government encouraged the destruction.  Meanwhile, the Roman government was so infested with sycophants disguised as philosophers there was essentially no understanding of what was happening at the ground level in the empire, leading alternative ecclesiastical institutions to take over the responsibilities the government was no longer doing.

                Thanks for the recommendation Chet.  I’m interested in that period.  Does the author present the early Christians as something closer to our revolutionary generation or closer to antifa?  Is there an estimate about the size of the early Christian population relative to the entire population?  Is there a demographic profile of the average Christian at that time?

                    There is definitely some destruction of idols by the Christians that would resonate with the destruction of confederate monuments today, but there was also a strong undercurrent of elites who eschewed the usual Roman bureaucracy in favor of the new religion, many becoming extreme monks or Bishops and forming what was essentially an alternative government.
Big picture items like demographics are missing, mostly because he writes by tracking the story of four historical figures, so it’s more of a catalogue of day-to-day observances of these figures through the years of changes than a grand narrative.

            That seems somewhat plausible although the collapse is well underway. Economic dominance was near-total a few years back and the failed sanctions have exposed how this has changed. Also, while the military is the most technologically advanced in history, it is utterly corrupt and led by incompetents. The repeated military humiliations have been as much the responsibility of the Pentagon as the political leadership despite claims to the contrary (Southern civil war buffs recognize this phenomenon of misdirected blame).There is a better historical analogy, although those always far short. More than ancient Rome, the GAE resembles the British Empire in the interwar period, when it also was at its height. The Great Depression came along, then World War II, and by 1946 the British Empire was fading fast and rapidly, which the Suez Crisis made clear once and for all. The British Empire’s apex was somewhere between 1922 and 1929, I would argue. It would be gone in little more than a generation.Back to the present, the Ukraine War seems more geared toward keeping Europe, and I include Canada, the United States land mass, and Australia and New Zealand in this, under imperial domination.  Nothing substantive has been done to check China, largely because that is out of reach, and there is no way this ends without Russia having more territory and a strengthened hand once it recovers. India and the rest of the world sees which way the wind is blowing.To use the British Empire analogy, it is 1928 all over again. We are likely to suffer both our Great Depression and Suez Crisis next year.

                Thanks for the link. The penultimate paragraph is key:“Openly telling everyone that they will lie to us to make Russia bleed to death, and openly threatening to sanction both China and India at the same time for not breaking with Russia is a big, glowing red sign indicating hubris. For some, this will suggest desperation on the part of the USA to maintain its global standing. To me, it suggests that the USA is confident in its own power, having put Russia onto the Europeans to allow itself to effect its Pivot to East Asia once and for all.”Very clearly, the question presented is whether the hubris is warranted. I agree it is, for a very short term*, so the question to me is whether the hubris can sustain domination. This piece leaves that open, but as I set forth above the answer clearly is the domination is not sustainable and is fading fast.Hubris, meet nemesis.*There is a very real error in the piece about industrial capacity and weapons-manufacturing; the United States is running on fumes there.

            Yeah, but Rome’s slaves were mostly genetically close to the Romans – by and large. They were still slaves at least producing things of value. Rome and its leaders glorified Rome.I think Manc’s description: “So the USA is now a confederacy of tribal grifters looking to fleece a dwindling band of suckers.”It is hard to look at the GAE’s domestic situation in terms of demographics. When the people rising up the ranks hate the nation they represent and have arrived to fleece it for their own material advantage it doesn’t look like a place that can stand up to its rivals.

            Soldo is righter than most, but too optimistic.I believe our rulers when they say their goal is to kill almost all of us and confine the rest in Habitrails (virtual ones within literal ones), and I think they’ve nearly accomplished it. If that’s taken as their medium-term aim, the “meta” in which they operate, their near-term irrationalities and failures at war/economy/etc. are great victories—against us.Do they know it? Largely not. But they are all, at some level of consciousness, murderous sadists*, and the machine has been so refined that there are no levers left on it that do anything but hurt us. They’ll jerk them until they break off.*Even Rand Paul voted to reward the capitol police for their heroic service against the insurrection. Conscience of the Senate.

            The comments bring up a good point too: the Patriot system never worked all that great, especially for its…billion dollar per-battery price tag (?!).  And $3 million a missile?  That price disparity is too great for something going up a piece of ordinance that costs maybe $10K.

            Except they won’t really be in Ukraine.
They’ll be in Poland.
The press releases will tout their effectiveness and the heroic actions of  Ukraine, but they’re going to be operated from Poland using NATO or US troops.

            The only thing I can think is that the Russians are keenly aware they have a serious demographic problem (low fertility, lack of new births, etc.) going into a war that could last years, possibly decades.Based on this realization, they are trying to keep their casualties to an absolute minimum by repeatedly bouncing the rubble with massed artillery strikes.I’m certain Russia has chemical agents they could drop into the Uke fortifications that would move things along, but Putin is too shrewd a legal mind to toss the GAE a golden opportunity to try him for crimes against humanity in the GAE media.

                Putin is adding new regions to Russia: Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhie, Kherson and hopefully Odessa and Kharkov. These are mostly ethnic Russian and Russian speaking regions which were given to Ukraine 100 years ago by Lenin.This is a way to overcome a dwindling number of Russians in Russian Federation, dwindling because of a low birthrate in the last 60-70 years.The success of this undertaking will forever place Putin in the Russian history books.

            The Russians have a peculiar way of war that starts with the premise that the point of war is to destroy the opposing army, not occupy its territory. They shaped the fight in Bakhmut, for example, so that the Ukrainians can bring in reinforcements to hold their positions, but take horrible punishment in the process. The longer it goes on, the weaker the Ukrainian army becomes as it funnels resources into this meat grinder.If the Russians were to make a frontal assault they would be the ones taking the huge casualties. Sure, they could over run the position eventually, but the cost of that ground would be enormous. Instead, they expend something they have in abundance, which is time, while the Ukrainians spend what they have in limited supply, which is blood.At some point, the Ukrainians will have to withdraw, probably to Kramtorsk, which is where the Ukrainian army HQ is located. it is another heavily fortified area. The Russians will quickly create another semi-caldron, hoping that it becomes a meat grinder for the Ukrainians.

                    I keep wondering if the long plan is not to so drain the West that the Chinese feel they can make a play for Taiwan. There is no getting around the fact that the West has run out of weapons to send to Ukraine. it is also clear that the capacity to make new stuff will not be on line for at least a year, maybe two.Imagine North Korea gets the green light to attack across the DMZ. At the same time, China blockades Taiwan. Meanwhile, the Russian army is on the border of Poland, after the Ukrainian army collapsed. it will make for an interesting round of negotiations.

                        If the North Koreans were foolish enough to head south over the DMZ, the South Korean military is more than game enough to handle them. Besides the Israelis and the Taiwanese, there’s no military more prepared for battle than the South Koreans.They have better tanks than our old, but still effective Abrams and they’re well-trained and capably led. They’re building a fighter aircraft (not too many countries can accomplish that feat) that will be a stealthier F-16 at first and later will have 80% of the F-35’s capability at 50% of the cost.Even though the North Koreans have gazillions of artillery pieces and tanks (more than what the Germans had when they invaded Poland), they’d be easy meat for a South Korean air force that’s well equipped with smart weapons to eliminate them.The North Korean air force is elderly relics with no in-flight refueling capability and no AWACS that wouldn’t last a few minutes if they made it into the air if not caught on the ground.The only North Korean goal would be to destroy Seoul and cripple the South Korean economy in a “from hell’s heart, I stab at thee” desperate last gasp. There’s no way they could conquer the South without losing their entire, antiquated military in the process. It would be a very costly war for sure, but one that would be impossible for North Korea to win, except if their goal is taking their enemies with them in a final blaze of glory.

                            This seems like an Asian variant on the Ukraine blunder. Land wars are won with artillery and infantry. This is the hard lesson in Ukraine right now. That and the North Koreans have modern air defense systems. The reason Washington has freaked out over the sale of S400 systems is they can knock down our best aircraft.
Frankly, the lesson of Ukraine is the era of manned fighter aircraft is coming to an end.

                            It is always hard to judge these things, but I suspect this is true. Maybe their military is a paper tiger and most of their stuff does not work very well. They do struggle to feed themselves, so how well are they doing with their military? On the other hand, their missile program suggests that maybe the famine claims may be over done.Even assuming a reasonable degree of ignorance, the best estimates are that the US would need to deploy a minimum of 250,000 troops to the peninsula and at least 1,000 combat aircraft. That is a huge undertaking under ideal conditions, but close to impossible if China is also blockading Taiwan. Of course, North Korea would be attacking Seoul. Most estimates say that millions would be dead as a result.

                        The S400 is good, but like any good SAM system, it can be spoofed or jammed or downright destroyed. We’ve given the Ukies some old HARMs (High Speed Antiradiation Missile) that date from the 1970s, but are pretty good with the frequent threat updates they receive. They’re not our best gear there. Our new HARM is a lot better than even its updated predecessor and could be considered a quantum leap better weapon. And it needs to be because the latest generation of Russian and Chinese SAMs are damned lethal from long range.What makes them tough is they’re getting closer to being able to knock out our tankers and AWACs, which would cripple U.S. airpower.It’s interesting to note that the Ukies’ old Soviet-era ECM systems have struggled against Russian SAMs and fighters.I disagree with you on the obsolescence of tactical aircraft because they’re highly mobile and can quickly bring a lot of firepower on targets faster than any artillery. If they have a degree of stealth (even frontal stealth is fine) and good ECM and ECCM (electronic counter counter measures), they have a really good change of surviving even in a heavy SAM environment. You have to degrade the threat radars with jamming and spoofing with chaff and other countermeasures and create a SAM-free corridor by taking out the radars and the launchers themselves.What’s going to be the gamechanger that could end tactical aircraft as we know them will be directed energy weapons such as lasers. There’s no juking a laser, but you combine that with SAMs for when atmospheric conditions degrade laser performance and that airspace will be tough if not impossible to enter.

                            The S400 *could* be jammed, but no evidence of it happening. That and the Russians are already rolling out the S500. You can be sure the Chinese are working this problem as well.
Where the Russians are making great leaps ahead of the West is in responding to the advances in SAM systems with cheap drones, which is the future. One F35 can be replaced with how many flying Doritos?

                The West was stupid to allow Russia an opportunity to go toe to toe against NATO equipment and operations and win.  Once Russia achieves overwhelming victory in Ukraine, the value of Western armaments is bound to go down in the marketplace. And our ability to intimidate other nations will fall precipitously.On top of that, Russia has been learning in real time how our intelligence and operations work. This strengthens them immensely.We had a nice bluff in on Russia. We should have kept it. But now we’ve shown our hand and they see they can kick our ass. It’s going to be a whole new world.

                If the strategy is to hold towns and bog down the Russians with a defense, that may not be a sound tactic for them.  Nothing prevents the Russians from encirclement and bypassing the towns.  A large army from could encircle, leave a smaller group to maintain the blockade and move on.

                Drones have been used against SAMs since the Israelis did in Lebanon in the early 1980s against the Syrians. One reason why the Ukies aren’t jamming S400s is we’re not giving them our best ECM gear and even if we did it likely isn’t compatible with their old Soviet-era jets. And we don’t want to expose our best methods to the Russians as well. Even the Patriot SAM is old and not as infallible as the Raytheon people had us believing during the Gulf War.The reason why UAVs haven’t taken over warfare is there is no substitute for a flesh-and-blood, well-trained pilot in the cockpit making decisions that not even an autonomous UAV can make. You could do man-in-the-loop like we do the Predator and Reapers, but datalinks are EASILY jammed or even hacked.Granted, my opinions are colored by my job in the defense industry working with manned tactical aircraft, but just like with autonomous “self-driving” cars, you’re going to throw scenarios at the programming in war that haven’t been considered by the programmers. AI is a pipe dream.The future of UAVs is as “loyal wingman” who carry more missiles in the fight and do so under the direction of a manned aircraft in the vicinity. It’s a force multiplier, much as smart weapons allowed one manned aircraft to destroy 20 or so targets in a single pass that would’ve taken what the Navy calls an “alpha strike” with lots of fighter escort, lethal suppression of air defenses, ECM jamming, tanker and AWACS sorties.

                    “And we don’t want to expose our best methods to the Russians as well.” That’s rich!!! Chances are they (and the Chinese, and the Israelis) had most or all of it before the first production units rolled off the lines. If we have any advantage, it’s that we are (were?) far better at actually manufacturing the hardware. But keep it secret? Doubtful.

            Breaking through massive, in-depth fortifications may be easier said than done.  And a breathrough that cannot be rapidly reinforced and be widened, can be pinched off and destroyed by a counter attack.  Better to wait until considerable forces have been assembled or “the big push” will end up looking like the Somme in 1916 or the Chemin des Dames in 1917.

                    Alzaebo: “The daily ‘parallel economy’ highlight is a real plus; I’m glad and grateful to see it.”On yesterday’s essay, “Custodial Musings”, I was trying to make the contrast between “too much fake money coming out of the Fed” versus “too many useless people”.And I had said [on that thread] that B!tch McConnell consistently voting for all of Tater Joe’s new spending bills is strong evidence in favor of the Elites &amp; the Oligarchs being terrified of the combination which is “too many useless people” and “not enough fake money”.Then today, we get the following headline…GOP SENATORS: Mitch McConnell ‘coercing’ them into backing big Democrat spendinghttps://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/4116381/postsI’m sensing that Jerome Powell’s crackdown on fake money has the Elites &amp; the Oligarchs terrified.Wouldn’t it be fascinating if Jerome Powell were to prove to have been an even moar important appointment by Trump than were Kavanaugh and Comey-Barrett?I’m thinking Jerome Powell needs to hire himself a food taster.And a 24×7 cadre of ex-USMC/ex-Seal/ex-Green-Beret dudes to jump in front of the bu11ets.Seriously.We have ample historical evidence [Lincoln, McKinley, Huey Long, Patton, Forrestal, McCarthy, Oswald, etc] that the Shape Shifters will not hesitate to liquidate an existential threat to their agenda.
