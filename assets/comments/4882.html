        I flew once after the TSA was empowered. Once.
Every single airport I stopped at I was the guy pulled out of line and patted down (What! No kiss first?).   The light brown and darker assholes who were left standing in line were looking at me and smirking.Now I drive or take the train, if the TSA is put onto trains, then I will only drive.

        I was watching ‘Orange Is The New Black’ the other day and I am pretty sure an airport employee, in a flashback to her life before she ended up in jail, was shown stealing an iPad from a passenger’s bag. However it was, a) understandable as she worked for the government (if she was TSA, that is), b) it was stolen for a birthday present and c) she was black, so I suppose all things considered it wasn’t such a big crime at all.

            A few years ago I was going through security. I never check anything of value. I put my electronics on the belt and strip down as required. Waiting to be fingered by the agent, I notice one of the blue shirts looking at by Chrome Book. He then walks off with it. I go through the rest of security and collect my things and walk over to where the blue shirt disappeared with by Chromebook. Another security guy stops me and I tell him I saw his partner steal by item and I wanted it back. He goes back to the room where the first blue shirt retreated and they both return with my ChromebookThe amazing thing was neither made any attempt to explain it. They were indifferent to having been caught stealing. Frankly, I was indifferent as it is what I have come to expect.

                Your name may be on “The List”, and they were just copying the entire hard drive.
To me, that’s a worse supposition.

        TSA officers remind me of Walmart employees. Walmart gives many feeble people jobs, an opportunity to make a few dollars serving the public. What TSA employees get for harassing people- six figures? huge pension at 55?- is hard to imagine. Very heavily racial minorities and lesbians, of course.
