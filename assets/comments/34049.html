        These filthy dirtbags ruined our telephone system too. Tell a zoomer that there was once a time when your phone rang and you just… picked it up and said hello. Now, 98% of phone calls are fraud/scammers and 98% of those calls are from India or Nigeria. The bottom line here goes beyond technology. The open society Tower of Babel is fundamentally flawed. These people come from a culture where this is just the standard way of doing things. It’s not a big deal to them, it’s normal. We do not come from this culture. For us this imposes a burden and strain. It’s not fair to demand that we live this way. We invented and propagated the telephone system because it made our lives better. The system as it functions now makes our lives worse. One imagines Alexander Graham Bell putting his invention in the closet when calls 2-100 were Indian scammers telling him his horse insurance is running out.

                Citizen of a Silly Country:“the white commons“
Always capitalize “White”.
Never type it in lower case.
kneegrow &amp; j00 &amp; pajeet &amp; wetback are to be typed in lower case.
But “White” must always be capitalized.

            It’s not just a culture. Gypsies have been in Europe for hundreds of years and their only ply and trade is scamming and scheming. Where did they come from originally? India. Shockingly, the only people you’re permitted to be racist towards in Europe are gypsies. A European will lecture an American for hours about how we just don’t understand blacks and that we need to be nice to them and demonstrate compassion. If you counter with their feelings about gypsies, they’ll say, “no, you don’t understand, you’ve never been around them,” without any hint of irony. Anti-Indian sentiment in Canada is becoming tolerable in the mainstream as they experience the excitement of their cities turning into open-air latrines.

                It’s fascinating to watch white Canadians start to openly complain about Indians. I’ve saying for years now that whites – even liberal whites – don’t like Indians and really don’t like Indians lecturing them.
But Indians can’t help it. Things are going to start getting interesting.

                    Someone posted an X link to the “joys of multiculturalism”:
https://x.com/ForeverScept/status/1915800349945794639
TL/DR/Don’t use X: It’s a link of Indian and Pakistanis protesting each other in the wake of the latest terrorist attack on Indians. The protest is in London.
One used to be able to say of events far away “Not my circus, not my monkey.” Except now the circus has pitched its big top in your backyard and the monkeys are running around your house screeching.

                    I try hard to not be a bigot. But when Shri Thana-whatshisname got on TV and said he was going to start impeachment against Trump, it gave me impure thoughts. How dare a fellow Anglo-Saxon like myself live in, say, India, and demand Droupadi Murmu’s resignation? In a stupid white accent speaking Hindi as well? I would not tolerate that among my people, living abroad. Neither should Indians.

                        Yeah i love how Indians in america are some of the loudest screechers of progressivism, but their own country still operates under the caste system.  If you want to fix something, fix your own damn country.

                Speaking as a European it’s you Americans constantly berating Europeans for our racism; if it’s not lectures on Muslims it’s whining about the evils of Russophobia. And then there’s our problematic attitude towards Israel…
Apparently we do nothing but sneer at Trump supporters who have a deep love for all things European and would never refer to us as Eurotrash or gloat about the latest massacre of the innocents in a European market.
Anyway,I’m just going to go out and be generally racist and condescending as only a snooty European can.
Toodle-oo.

                        Also consider that ethnocentric Russians were not running the Soviet Union until its very end, and when they ‘finally’ got control over it and failed in attempts to reform it, they disbanded it. There were two revolutions in Russia 1917/18. The first was a genuine Russian revolution (backbone agrarian socialists wanting land reform) which overthrew the monarchy, and the second was Judeobolsevik which overthrew the genuine Russian revolution.Blaming the Russians as a people for everything Soviet bad is shortsighted. They were a people without a ruling class, stampeded like the human cattle all working classes are, serving the objectives of the minorities who ruled over them. We Americans, indeed most European-race peoples, are now in the same sinking boat.

                Europeans are getting a full dose of Diversity now. Some of them have opened their eyes, but the Spiteful Mutants among them will continue on their merry way to destruction.In the 70’s and 80’s, I experienced that exact same European disapproval against Americans and our supposed treatment of blacks. And I also heard back then that exact same opinion of Gypsies, almost word-for-word what you described.Well, the European gated community of decades ago has been thrown wide open. Maybe some of them will realize that Jim Crow wasn’t so bad after all. If there is any sense of self-preservation, that is.

                Shockingly, the only people you’re permitted to be racist towards in Europe are gypsies.
Not so much, anymore. The thought police are coming for that, too. Even calling them “gypsies” is now officially frowned-upon.

                    Gypsies arrived into Europe aprox 1000 years ago, telling a BS story about being oppressed in Egypt, hence the name Gypsies
Now I wonder where did the get the idea for such a story, they run low level scams, the other group runs high level scams
Both hate the Gadjo, but need the Gadjo to live

                        Hence the “4th Nail” excuse, it was a gypsy that stole the 4th nail, the one that would have gone through Christ’s heart when he was on the cross, so gypsies believe they have a God given right to steal.

                            The European gypsies call themselves romanians, but heritage romanians are White, not brown.  I’ve seen gypsies throught the US, although most American Whites cannot distinguish them from other subcons.  The ‘Travelers’ usually refers to White Irish who live a similar lifestyle.  They are genetically distinct from other Irish but have zero biological connection to brownsubcon gypsies.

                In fairness to the Indians, the word gypsies and “getting gypped or getting gipped” has its roots in Egypt and not India.
Just to be clear, it is merely the origin of the word and not the people.
As far as the Indians themselves, their whole independence movement was based on getting the “phirangs” (white people) out.    They can hardly complain when the “phirangs” return the favour a few decades later when they invade the phirang’s homelands.

            Imagine having to manage the affairs of three Silent Generation relatives right now, all of whom are still mentally sharp but whose social attitudes remain in 1958. Every day is Groundhog Dog: stop sending cash and checks in the mail with birthday stickers all over the envelope, stop answering the phone, ignore any email with these words…24 hours later, they’re right back to the same practice. Because the scammers use the same area code and often local prefix for the numbers, the calls appear to be coming from their own towns.“Why do these people call me all day? Where are they living in town? Don’t they realize it doesn’t work? I tell them and they just hang up! They’re not supposed to do that!”

                I wonder if a day will come when I get old enough to start falling for internet scammers, or if the victims are exclusively people who turned 50 before the internet became ubiquitous and thus never got comfortable with it. If the latter, then presumably there might come a day when the scammers no longer have any marks. At least among the white west (if it still exists). Perhaps they will have to start scamming SSAs who are late to the internet, but from them, there isn’t so much to scam.

How many times will it attempt to upgrade you thru out the process to wring money out of you?  Then at the end, want your return quicker?  We’ll send you a pre loaded card but also charge you 150 bucks on the spot.  Stupid and desperate people will fall for this.  We need to be stewards of society, not predators.

                            Interesting flashback—especially when one thinks of the implication then of the song.  Girls being liberated by Feminism, boys wearing long hair and tie dyed pants, etc.
Now it is girls thinking they really *are* men and men thinking they are women.  Both dressing/acting the part and demanding you play-act with them.  😉

                                The god they serve is hermaphroditic, a la Baphomet.  Thus they push the bi-sexual and trans agenda ceaselessly.
These apparently secular mores and laws have very ancient precedent; as always, it is a religious war.

Anyone sane born 1980 or before must be deeply saddened and shocked by how the country has profoundly changed.

                They also target certain zipcodes based on income and past successes.  I used to get tons of calls – a dozen a day at least – from Indian scammers.  I had limited success by telling them they were compensating for having tiny brown d*cks and then calling them back when they hung up.  Now, I get no calls at all.  Plenty of old farts around here, but not a lot of them are wealthy.  In my case, in no way has absence made the heart grow fonder – I generally abhor all variants of sucons wherever I encounter or even read of them.

                    Spam calls used to be only a couple weeks but now they are several a day. Recently I learned how to find tune the “do not disturb feature” on my Android phone. Chances are your iPhone has something similar. Figuring out how to work it is up to you. If your lifestyle requires you to field all calls you may be at a disadvantage.

                        An iPhone?  Heaven forfend!  I have the cheapest Android ‘smartphone’ I could find.  Zero apps.  Don’t answer calls unless I recognize the #, and only a few have that #.  I use it primarily to call/text within immediate family, and to have for emergencies.  I will not allow tech to run my life; it is a servant and will remain so.

            Around 2017 I had to install an app that blocks all calls unless they’re in my contacts because I would get upwards of 50 spam calls a day. I used to use the built in spam blocker &amp; then I had to download 3rd party apps, both use databases to detect spam numbers but that year they got completely overwhelmed.I also had to record a five minute voicemail intro &amp; explain to everyone what number to hit to skip it because half those calls are robots that never shut hell up. It got to the point where my voicemail was full every 3-4 days from robots talking into it. I had to record something long enough that the robots could talk their asses off &amp; finally hang up before the beep.Oh and semi related but thanks to HUD housing, biden (and earlier, obama) &amp; black rock there’s now so many nogs living in my area code that its added another layer of pollution. I now routinely get texts &amp; calls from apes either dialing the wrong number or, my favorite, putting my number on craiglist when selling stolen items.I ended up driving to the Whitest county near me that had a different area code &amp; swapped my number to get theirs which has thankfully put an end to that problem.In other words I had to White flight my phone number lol, kinda funny to think about.

                The horrible thing is that they can fake any phone number at all, so theoretically, you can get spam calls from people in your contact list. Probably mostly a coincidence so far, but I’m sure they’re working on stealing your contacts.

Hopefully someday someone I know will get an AI phone call claiming to be me with my gorilla voice impression. That’d be funny.

                    That wouldn’t surprise me at all &amp; its not that hard to come by that info. You can pay to advertise on apps &amp; with that you get access to tons of metadata of the people who see them. Given all these apps want access to everything on your phone it doesn’t seem like a stretch that they’d also hand over everything they could.It doesn’t even need to be accessed that way either, think about all the websites that have been hacked, there’s next to no chance that info isn’t being compiled &amp; shared/sold. Even when its a “minor” hack &amp; they didn’t steal very sensitive stuff like credit card info they virtually always get your name, address &amp; phone number.

            Years ago, I got a heavily Jamaican accented fellow calling me about something ridiculous. I decided to have some fun with them.Caller: Would you like to buy this service? What is your name?Me: I am Satan, the leader of the fallen, the Prince of this World, Accuser of Man, Lord of the Flies and the doom to fallen souls. (in a growling voice not unlike Tom Waits)Caller: No, you’re not mon.Me: You’re going to come see me soon and we’re going to spend all eternity raping your soul again and again while you burn in the flames of perdition for your sins.Caller: You are joking mon.Me: I’m standing right behind you. I own your soul now.He hung up pretty quickly.I remember as a kid in the 80s all of the telemarketers calling at dinner. My mother had a whistle that she’d blow into the receiver to let the telemarketer know how she felt about them. Good times.

                I did something similar with a guy once a couple years ago. He put my number on double extra frequent dial from his scam house, so I had to forward my number to a Florida Time and Weather number for several months to let it die down.
Sad lesson: Don’t mud wrestle with a pig, they’ll drag you down and beat you with experience.

                They use bulk phone systems. One of them in Chicago used to be a customer of mine. The phone system is designed to permit this sort of scam. They use the legacy excuse that the old switched public telephone system had no way to do source verification, and thus they are powerless to stop it … while simultaneously resisting updating standards so theycanstop it.

                There’s a small chance that Pakistan and India will nuke one another over the latest violence in Kashmir. My biggest fear is that the innate cowardice of both sets will prevent them from escalating past lobbing mortars at nothing. My second biggest fear is that neither country has the nuclear ordnance to do the job properly and we’ll get even more “refugees.”

            Now, 98% of phone calls are fraud/scammers and 98% of those calls are from India or Nigeria.
You can get yourself blacklisted, though. Whenever an Indian guy called, I started screaming insults at him until he hung up, and after a while, the number of calls dropped to a trickle, about two a year.
I told my sister this, and the next time she got a scam call, she handed the phone to her 12-y.o. son and told him he could say “nigger” all he wanted – a chance he leapt at with commendable enthusiasm. It worked for her too.

                Problem is these calls are now almost all fronted by AI—poor AI I’ll admit—but AI nonetheless.  You annoy no human being because you are not talking a human being.  If you say the correct responses, you may get connected to a human, but that not always so.  Is it worth your time to wait through the sales pitch, then answer a few questions in order to be switched to a human who can hang up faster than you can swear?

And yes, it was totally worth it, because it took three calls to get me off their call lists.

Of course, these calls are never from the same number twice and because of that reporting them as spam perhaps identifies one in three to my (and others’) phones.I maintain this is a scam that is easily prevented.  These scammers contract with the regional phone companies for these “special” lines and the regional phone companies collect handsome profits for this “service”.  Seems a simple fix to require that all such services sold be monitored for spam and when detected, the service cancelled.  This is not against current law as when I was in the business years ago, we were exempted because we needed to monitor phone lines we provided as technical support folk.  Of course, we only listened for quality assurance and buggy lines and then moved on.

        It’s a bummer how awful the Internet has become along with all forms of media (movies, music etc). Talking to Amish and Mennonite farmers in the midwest has convinced me they are the sane ones and rest of us are nuts.

        The internet is just another example of tragedy of the white (men) public commons. Whites are the only group that can maintain public commons. Our pleasant neighborhoods, our childlike adherence to the law, our fair business practices, our impartial judiciary, etc.All of these create a society unlike and far better than any other group. Alas, we’ve allowed non-whites into our public commons, and they are tearing them apart, even forcing us to act like them if only in self-defense.The answer, of course, is privatizing everything – schools, neighborhoods, community groups, internet, etc. – to maintain order. We are heading toward a South American-style society, and there’s nothing that we can do to stop it.

            They see us as marks, and maybe we are. But the idea that we are forced to live around them and be subject to their scams and shady business dealings is ridiculous. Our governments used to try to protect us from this behavior – but now it is starting to be run by these people, so there is no hope of that anymore. They will bleed us dry and then go back to their usual behavior, where they treat each other far worse than we treat them.

                    As Citizen of a Silly Country says, the fact that we are generally honest and open also enabled us to build a nice society. But it is bad for us when confronted with hostile outsiders who come from a culture built around scamming people. This isn’t even the first outsider group that treated us this way. These outsider groups don’t even like our society. They will live in it it because it is prosperous, but then they go back to their home country to live like kings and mistreat their countrymen. I can’t tell you how many times I read a story about how some couple got arrested for enslaving someone here, and it is always a fellow countryperson. This is just how they see the world. The shitlib attempt to codify “caste discrimination” alongside the other isms is hilarious.The failure of the “open society” to recognize this will be its downfall.

Which is the point, at least among the ringleaders.
Your comment reminds me that I never read Popper’s famous work about the enemies of the open society of universal brotherhood and crypto-Masonry, or whatever the OS is supposed to be. Since I have other stuff in queue, I will order Google Genesis 2.5  Flash (“Uses advanced reasoning”) for a summary and analysis. I expect rose petals, sugar, and spice.

                    One could state that “suckers” should be removed from their money.  However, note that many of these “suckers” are the very elderly who are mentally impaired through the process of age and quite helpless to defend themselves from a scammers’ persuasion.I was at my bank a few months ago to obtain a couple of large cashiers checks to send the kids.  The older teller-manager was called and engaged me in conversation about who and what and life in general—but the real reason was to get a sense of my competency.I brought this (that I was savvy) to her motivation and she readily admitted such.  She stated she catches 3-4 fraudulent money transfer schemes regarding the elderly draining their bank accounts *per week* at just this, my branch!  I joked about Nigerian princes, but she said such was no joke and many of these scams were of such a ridiculous nature and they still worked.Ordinarily, I tell people to mind their own business, but not this time.  I was glad there was such a person at the branch.

                We are marks to some extent, but white people have scammed too. I just think it’s the cultural difference of it. White folk scam other white folk and we blame ourselves, and understand the game and the players to some extent. When anAuslanderdoes it, it’s like an unknown virus attacking the body.That’s the great shame of all this globalism and diversity. When I meet an Indian or a Nigerian, I want the meet the best they have to offer. I don’t want to meet some normie scumbag. I don’t want to invite bigotry into my life. There’s enough people I dislike, and hatred is a sin.

Bed bugs, too, are going to act according to their nature, and nurture, if any. This is not a good reason for indifference when they tag along for a ride into your home or for seeking the best which the bed bugs have to offer in them.

For him, it’s a condition which makes it bothersome not to insert his ancestors into the fictional family tree of BŠ. His ethics are like that of a fearful dog, child, or enlisted man. (Read: “sin”, i.e. disobedience.)His condition makes himan enemy, as is 3g4me with her simple, idolatrous reading of Israel’s complicated literature of national elitism and supremacy. With better reading of better translations, however, that ancient scribbling can be used victoriously against the nazis without becoming mentally disordered like the trinitolaters and Israel’s own many superstitious simpletons.

                            In the modern sense, it is not sinful because it is not on the list of thou shalt nots. In the classical sense, it is sinful, as in falling short of the glory of God.
Hate is a soul poison. Get yourself all riled up about pajeets or whatever and see how long it takes to settle down enough to truly appreciate the sound of the birds, or the beauty of the delicate crabapple blossoms.
You only get 24 hours a day, and only so many days. Why waste them on hate?

                                Yeah, destabilizing, but the fact didn’t get in the way of those who wrote Israel’s literature. We read that ha’šem hates the false witness and the divider (Prov. 6:19). It or they has hated many others, too, such as men who lie with men (Lev. 18, 20). The “glory of [Israel’s] God” has never excluded hatred. It’s a fact which has been on display to the whole world for decades in Palestine. Even Jesus made this clear his the fuming parables about minas and talents.

            Yes. But privatizing everything here is a very heavy lift. Down in LatAm, everything has been organized from the jump around your principle. At our HQ in Brazil, our guys drive right into the basement or chopper onto our roof. They never leave the building. All fancy restaurants and private clubs have armed guards. In other cities in LatAm, country clubs are mini-cities, with gyms, pools, restaurants, spa all behind gates, guards and guns. This is considered perfectly normal. We would take a generation at least to make this transition. It’ll happen, but I won’t live to see it.

            The white commons used to be the white cities. Back before the so-called “civil rights movement” mandated inclusion of the Hutus and criminalized any attempt to resist their encroachments. Now look at those cities. Compare the cities of 2025 with the cities of 1955. Once clean, safe and beautiful, they have been wrecked. These are the fruits diversity and inclusion.

            Another downside to losing the white commons is that companies no longer give you a contact email on their website. You either have to call their tedious bot or use some wonky custom messaging app embedded in their site.
…privatizing everything…
If I could pay a small fee to have a direct phone number to my account manager in the bank, I’d happily shell out $10 for each call.

            As an Anglo who has widely traveled in and even lived in 2 Latin American countries, you have the right of it. It’s not all bad. Except a handful of cases where I traveled with an armed escort, the main problem in Latin America is simply crimes of opportunity which usually means petty theft. It’s amazing how quickly you can get used to living in a nice home with every door and window covered with metal bars, often decorative wrought iron,broken glass embedded in  high masonry walls, razor wire as needed and perhaps a vicious dog. And depending on the specific circumstances perhaps firearms on hand or even armed guards.

                A Brazilian was telling me a while back, that one of the reasons he likes Dublin is the lack of crime, he can just take money out of any random ATM, and just not worry about it. Generally for him its a safe city
Stuff like this is all relative, Dublin seems safe if you’re from Brazil, but the locals in Dublin can see what direction the trend is moving. My guess is Dublin and other European cites converge with Brazil/South America

                    A variation exists in my burg on the Hispanic side of town.  You’ll see not only iron bars on windows and doors, but also a chain link fence that runs around the entire home—front, side and back yards.  Inside the perimeter (kill zone) run two or more pit bulls.  You simply don’t make it to the door or windows to attempt a break in.  This is reminiscent of the boar farmers in South Africa.  Their homes often have a porch that runs around the entire house and at night they have the dogs sleep on it.  Keeps out the animals and negros—but then I’m being redundant here.

        The problem with Indians is that every barrier erected to their scheming and scamming will eventually be circumvented. If we IP-blocked the entire subcontinent of India, they’d all be running VPNs by the next week. They’re completely unproductive people. The few of them who are somewhat intelligence use their acumen for more elaborate scams. This is why they’re still a 3rd world country. They might have sky scrapers, but those were built by Koreans. And these are the Indians that are separated by an entire ocean. They’re a nuisance.The ones within our country are infinitely more of a problem due to their monopolization of industries. If you talk to an apolitical white person, you’d get the impression that no white guy had ever ran a gas station or a hotel before. Maybe they’re just better at managing these things? Anybody who has stayed in a hotel prior to the patelification of the hospitality industry can tell you hotels have gotten a lot worse. They’ve also pushed into the tech industry in the past 15 years to the point that they’re able to lock out white talent. If you want to see white guys in tech, you need to go find a company that’s contracted to maintain government legacy systems in ancient languages like COBOL and PL1. Of course Indians never intended to stay in the technical roles (not that they were any good at it) but have occupied the next rung up in management and middle management. There’s also a top-down press. At one point, almost every CEO of every tech company was an Indian. It goes without saying that if you are dumb enough to hire a major consulting firm like Deloitte, Accenture, McKinsey, IBM, Bain, etc., the actual team assigned from them will be 3/4 or more Indian. And their main job will be to act as go-betweens between you and their peons in India.Even if we deported the frauds here and made it unpalatable for the ones who couldn’t be caught to live here anymore, we’d still face the problem of Indians in India. India has almost 700 million internet users to the United States’ 312 million (China leads with over a billion and 4th place is Indonesia with 212 million). As mentioned before, they’re sneaky, even if they are dumb. But one can have hope. There are 3 countries on Earth that have nukes and are dumb and/or vindictive enough to use them flippantly. Two of them are India and Pakistan (Indians who converted to Islam, basically). They’re both at war currently.

                They’ve definitely been at it for a long time, but around 15 years ago was when the entryism stopped and the occupation began. Most people think of 2015 when Disney fired their white tech workers and had to train their H1B replacements as the defining moment of the era of Indian domination of tech jobs in the US. Prior to 2010, most IT departments and programming teams were still pretty white in the US.

                    The biggest problem for the Chinese at my university was spoken language proficiency.  It was often the case where we had to communicate mostly by email.  Of course, this made the Chinese student ineligible to teach classes, or rather discussion sections.  Indians however, were mostly high caste and spoke excellent conversational English.

            If you talk to an apolitical white person, you’d get the impression that no white guy had ever ran a gas station or a hotel before. Maybe they’re just better at managing these things?I wondered about the Indian takeover of gas stations and hotels as well, and I saw a post a few weeks back describing how it was done. Apparently it’s a government funded scam where the government hands out low/no-interest loans to Indians that heritage Americans aren’t allowed to qualify for. One Indian will buy a gas station with the loan while his cousin will buy another gas station with another loan. When the loans come due, they both apply for new near-zero interest loans to purchase theother’sgas station – essentially flipping them to each other. In that way, the principal never comes due and given the tiny interest payments all the proceeds of the businesses are pure gravy. I suspect they can inflate the values of their businesses as well when they flip them and the government will happily loan up to and beyond any declared and inflated value so they can pocket some of the loan proceeds.

                As businessmen they are risk-averse bottom feeders and go into businesses like motels, gasoline stations, sweatshops, buying and renting out houses and apartments, online loan sharking, and the like. The businesses are at the bottom of the totem pole, with little risk and low returns to capital. What they do is relentlessly cut costs by cutting corners on service and by exploiting their workers. They are not innovative, they will not invest in speculative ventures, they are not adventurous. They were at the bottom of the totem pole during the glory days of the British empire as well, serving as shopkeepers and petty traders, the most petite of the petite bourgeoisie.

                A Mr. Heroes opened up by me &amp; I grabbed some food &amp; chatted up the indian &amp; he told me straight up that he got a grant from the government to start a business.Our government puts us into debt &amp; uses our tax dollars to to fund foreigners &amp; give them a financial edge against their own citizens.I’m flirting with hopping the border &amp; then cross back over with the darkest tan I can get with a turban on my head &amp; larp as an indian with a made up name so I can get all the benefits these invaders have. Its not like they vet these people at all anyway &amp; the way the courts are run I’ll be dead before they ever deport me or cut off the handouts.

People who love to pontificate seldomly accept information that contradicts their dogmatic beliefs. Its like talking to a wall, one that that can talk back to you &amp; while the ability to talk back is certainly more stimulating than a regular wall the end result is nigh identical.

                    The sad fact is that if you want to access even half the privileges this country gives to foreigners, you need to do time in the nation’s military and leave it without getting into trouble before you get your honorable on your DD214. And the only reason the country keeps that up is because they have to entice people to join and because veterans tend to do very “antisocial” things when they’re angry. Better to buy them off and keep them happy. And if they’re not happy, at least you have something you can hold over their heads. Can’t use VA benefits if you get convicted of a felony.

                        I had a friend who was in the Navy &amp; after his first voyage around the world he came back &amp; was telling me about it. One thing he said that stuck out to me is that the military is one of just a handful of ways blue collar guys in the midwest &amp; south can get a semblance of the stability &amp; trajectory what previous generations had.
He would’ve had to go into obscene debt to get his degree if he hadn’t done that &amp; he’d probably be dead if he didn’t join, that straightened him out good.

You are exactly correct about the sweetheart loan scam the government provides to these foreigners.
This same scam was used to start awful corporations like Chobani, who actively aid in the invasion of America any way they can.

        Years ago, my daughter and I watched skin and hair car tutorials on you tube. It was mostly young white moms with many adorable little girls. At some point, it devolved into black women or men who pretend to be women. It was almost comical because they were often fat and bearded. The last time I checked, it was Indian women speaking indiscernibly.Indians are insufferable. An Indian doctor said of India “if the weather doesn’t kill you, the food will and if the food doesn’t kill you, the people will.”

        I used to loathe the block/mute/ignore functions… but now I make use of them without hesitation, every day. Brave seems to block most of the ads fairly well. I don’t waste time in heavily moderated spaces…I’ve become a digital nomad. If a space becomes pozzed or enriched by ethnics and perverts I just leave. Such people can invade spaces but they can’t maintain them. If a site dies I’ll just leave it behind without remorse.The public square is a bad analogy. Once the usual suspects trash a public square you’re left with an eye sore…and a desolate space for druggies, nogs, and failed derelicts. When a popular website dies it’s just another obscure internet site with nothing in it.

            The best thing I did years ago was keep and use my landline phone and answering machine. I now get ZERO spam calls. I used a recorded message that goes like this “You’ve reached the number you dialed. If my voice is not the voice you expected to hear, you’ve dialed the wrong number. If my voice IS the voice you expected to hear, leave your message after the beep”. That way I neither provide my name nor my actual phone number. The rest of the time I use a throwaway phone and change it monthly.

        Another thing to add is the proliferation of goofy and cutesy runarounds in TikTok to everyday speech such as “grape” for rape, “SA” for sexual assault, “unalive” for death, whether it be murder or suicide, and so on. What makes this onerous is that you encounter this TikTok speech all the time in other platforms that don’t have onerous censorship like that.The internet slop not only threatens to upend the internet public spaces, it will upend language itself. How many times have certain ethnicities been mocked for their speech, such as the American Blacks Ebonics, or the Ukrainians butchered Russian, rightly so in my opinion?

            A lot of those words are also because Youtube demonitizes and/or uses the algorithm to punish anything using those words or swear words since trying to become a “family friendly” platform. That’s why you’ll see a lot of popular “content creators” “bleeping” themselves. A lot of our guys who try to make some money on Youtube have to use the same euphemisms when they talk about the Muslim rape gangs of Europe or the white male suicide epidemic. This is nothing new for the right as we’ve had to use coded language for a long time, leading to sometimes humorous epithets like “basketball Americans.”

                I’d rather they just use “bleeping” rather than using the cutesy language. For God’s sake, grapes is one of my favorite foods. I’d rather it not be associated with such an ugly subject, and you know there are going to be a lot of morons who will do exactly that.

            The dumbest example so far (It’s early, I could see something even dumber) occurred on YouTube related to my hobby. (NERD ALERT! 🤓🚨It’s scale modeling building plastic kits)So YouTube model builders and reviewers are threatened with being banned and de-monetized because they’ve shown the dreaded “crooked cross” that adorned the tails of German aircraft 1933-45, and often other military equipment. Forget for a moment that 1) It’s depicting a 100% accurate representation of a piece of equipment and 2) Thanks to busy-bodies world wide model companies CAN’T include that marking on decal sheets or have to print it in multiple pieces so someone won’t scream and faint.(Odd Red Stars for the USSR are A-OK. The Soviets treated my ancestral homeland as bad as, if not worse than, the Germans as they and the Germans rolled back and forth across it from 1939 – 44)These are the same people who banned model racing cars sponsored by cigarette companies, yet want to legalize the pot. 🙄

            For me its the acronyms instead of words “rn” “af” “wdym” &amp; I swear people go out of their way to alter what they’re going to say to needlessly insert them. That or they’ll just tack it on to the end of a statement.They’ll take something like “hey I’m coming over” &amp; slap “rn” onto it to ebonicize it. Or “thats cool” &amp; they’ll slap “af” on the end.I don’t know how people delude themselves into believing that IQ hasn’t been dropping every generation, we’re getting to the point people aren’t even typing out words despite the fact phones &amp; computers all have autofill typing. I’m counting down the days until we start communicating with clicks &amp; stick bones through our noses, already halfway there with all the septum piercings I see on women.

                I’ve dropped close relatives from my life because they insisted on typing “u” as a substitute for “you.” Nobody is so busy or space-constrained they cannot type “you.” And it was invariably the couch potatoes who insisted on this convention.No.

                    Nobody is so busy or space-constrained they cannot type “you.”I think that’s what makes it so infuriating to me, there’s no legitimate reason to type that way unless done intentionally for humorous effect or something.Almost without exception the people who type like this are insufferable to interact with in person as well.

            TikTok isn’t the source of the problem. Elon is. Twitter hides (to some degree) any post that mentions any crime or that seems to be “negative” toward any business. He announced/admitted it during his Christmas drug binge.Of course the filters are a mess and barely work because he doesn’t hire white people or English speakers, but his positivity policy has polluted the language of all the good-boy Republicans, who no longer enumerate the crimes of our social betters (e.g., illegal aliens). And you can’t search for words with asterisks randomly*n*s*r*t*dinto them, so you can’t find that news even if you’re looking for it.Are we allowed to talk about congressional insider trading? ICE participation in child prostitution? Nobody’s sure, but apparently not—not without getting put on secret probation.

        for some reason, i no longer see ads on twitter.  and my feed doesn’t get saturated with irritating topics i don’t care about (e.g. taylor swift fans).  have noticed the slop effect all over.  people “reviewing” a piece of hifi equipment they have clearly not listened to.the current internet is doomed, for the reasons stated in this post.  what comes next will have to address the slop and other failings, in order to be useful.  i only pay attention to a few sites and individuals now, and will skipanything about trump, ukraine deal, doge, eu rearmament, etc etc etc.  all time wasting topics, especially if the word “should” appears in the title.just out of curiosity, do people here still watch big three tv networks?  i could get them for free, with an antenna, but don’t bother.  it’s like they don’t exist for me.  which is an odd feeling, because growing up they really did have a lot of fun shows.

The computer is literally the libraries of Alexandria. It is the sum knowledge of Man. You can waste your time in the kids’ section with the clowns and retards – or set your mind free and use this tool to its true potential. Most of us can’t do a rudimentary objective web search. And yet – that is all you need to do to avoid the slop farms, the manipulators and propagandists.Twitter and Facebook are time sucks where you roll in the gutters brawling with stupids.

            do people here still watch big three tv networks?
Sparingly. The Mrs. likes her “singing” shows and watchingJeopardy!,all of which are on Big Network TV. Once in a great while we’ll watch a sporting event (IndyCar is on Fox this season) but other than that, it’s no longer Must See TV and hasn’t been for decades.

Google? Seriously, that ended its life as a ‘search’ engine years ago. An ad server with Surveillance baked in — see those immediate claims of what some person, accused of some thing, “searched”. Always from this ‘Don’t Be Evil’ outfit of spiteful mutants. Use Startpage.

            “Yourube is only good for repair videos.”Just before the COVID panic I starred watching videos about differential equations. I continued to watch them until I had filled up almost two notebooks with lecture notes and sample problems from a few teachers ‘ channels. I’d stop a video at a problem, figure out the solution on my own if I could, then continue the vid to see how well I did. Getting stuck was never a problem, since I could just tap the play button after a few minutes of fruitless struggle. In the old times, getting stuck at home on a problem was like driving unawares into a dead end alley in long truck.Yourube has lots of videos about carpentry saws, too. You can watch demos about all sorts of saws, techniques, and methods. It’s great if you know how to avoid ads and the slop.

            You Tube has some good medical advice on some topics.  I’ve had plantar fasciitis and there are dozens of videos on treatments.   Some useless some not.  Repair videos- excellent.  Historical documentaries made before the awokening are superior.    Even old Noir movies filmed in LA and NYC in the 50s.  Watch it through Brave and you get no ads.

        This is another aspect of having to pay for the past.  Indians wouldn’t/couldn’t be doing all this today if they had not been colonized by Britain.  There would be a language barrier.
Indian and Pakistan have had rumors of war this week.  May they nuke each other off the face of the earth.

            Japan would most likely still be in a state of pre-industrial feudalism and China still mostly peasants on rice paddies were it not for white intervention. The whole world as we know it is a white creation, and the wogs, whose every modern possession and custom came from whites, can’t stop complaining that whites haven’t given them enough.

                Wrong and wrong.
Much of rest of the world, yes.
Pride in one’s own race is good. Ignorant narcissism is not.
FWIW the sanest people literally *ever* were the early Tokugawa shoguns and their advisors who erected an early Great Firewall (*) against the world and enjoyed two centuries of peace, prosperity, and cultural flourishing.
*Plenty of useful things were allowed in. It wasn’t a total shut-out.

            I watched this “Agatha Christie” docu-thing with the short guy that played her Poirot character — even in this they stuffed the DEI into the viewers like turkeys.So they feature the usual ‘crimes’ against the poor, poor indig-peeps. While in S. Africa, they have some fugly bleck broad, and two swarthy guys demanding ‘what is Africa’s is given to Af-RICK-ah!’Maybe it would be better if there was some HINT of recogntion … before they claw it all away …. you know, clean water, railroads, hell, roads, indoor plumbing.At this point I would be fine if they got their Monkey’s Paw curse recompense: return to their pre-British (Italian/German/Portugeuse/Belgian/French) state — back it all out.Likely it collapses there soon enough anyway.

        You can’t miss what you never had. I avoided those sites when they were (presumably) full of white folks because they were slop even then. Interestingly, the DR sphere (if there is such a thing) seems to still be mostly free of this. It’s as if saying badwords and engaging in wrongthink throws up some kind of force field against it. I suspect this poses a real problem for the creators of the digital panopticon. How can they control our digital ghetto without saying badwords and promoting wrongthink themselves? They could just shut it all down, but then we might go out and get more active in meatspace. It’s a real conundrum.

        Ah, the ‘cell phone experience’….A couple of DECADES ago I realized life was way too short to spend time DAILY ‘checking messages’ that were set up for the mentally deprived. Like those ‘text scrolls’ in movies …. set at a speed for those that read at a 2nd grade level.I see/hear others ‘checking their messaegs’ … sloooow intonation, “press one” … “press 2” and most of the “messages” are some Indian guy, calling about your (fill in here) — scam.Set your phone to ONLY receive calls from people in your Contact list.Set it so that it does not accept messages, with a message, ‘text me if important…’ and reclaim your life.Set it to NEVER ‘notify’ you, light up while you are sleeping.. and so on. Sure, some fambly will grumble… usually older folks. Trust me, you can explain to them until the cows come home but they will not get it.I use this fucking device, it does not use me — as much as is possible in the modren world.

        I was talking with a relative who is planning to take her young ones to the Smithstonian and DC this summer. She went when she was a kid, back before the cultural genocide had advanced so far. In any case, I did what I always do which is vet it for anti-White stuff and try to make a roadmap. I don’t want her kids internalizing self-hatred.At the top of the offering of black,black, black, black, and more black black black black was a featured exhibit of Nat Turner’s bible. Yes. A savage band of indiscriminate mass murderers is given moral sanction at the Smithstonian. Why? Because they murdered the collective guilty who deserve mass murder. I wanted to get the information on Nat Turner to send my relative so she could see for herself that it wouldn’t be a good idea to expose the kids to power condoning their mass murder.I went through 12 pages of results of, “academic studies”, which were polemics discussing why Turner was justified and how his actions were heroic. I never found a source article or short summary to send.In the end she took my word for it, and has plans to see the space center museum which I am told is still wholesome. No doubt, they will center Africans somewhere there, but hopefully there will be no Nat Turner the scientist exhibit.The point is, search has become like those days when Whites were erased from all of human existence by Google. That is also the lesson about the Probability Calculators we call AI. Those things are not intelligent. The do not seek out information on their own and reason through it and weigh it against human experience, intuition and an understanding of the foibles of being human. They regurgitate what someone trained them to regurgitate.Speaking of feudalism, incorporate drones into your planning for how to survive the Kali Yuga.

            Smithsonian has been bad for a long time.  It was tolerable (about 50% good and 50% questionable diversity exhibits) back in the late ’90s when I took my older son.  When I took the younger in ’07 it was about 80% non-White.  Nothing like I used to see on annual school fieldtrips in the ’60s – ’70s.  It’s run by womyn, joos, DEI hires, etc.

            ATTENTION: RealityRules!!!The DC version of the Smithsonian literally abuts N!66erTown to the South [Independence Avenue is the demarcation line].It is NOT safe for any White people to venture to the South of the Smithsonian, and I wouldn’t be all that crazy about simply walking around on the Mall north of the Smithsonian.I strongly strongly strongly urge your peeps to head out west, to Chantilly, VA, to enjoy the safety of the Air &amp; Space museum to be found there.It’s now named for a non-j00ish Hungarian, named “Steven F Udvar-Hazy”.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_F._Udvar-Hazy_CenterIf they keep to the horse country around Chantilly, they should be able to experience a wonderful trip.But venturing into the jungle around Independence Avenue is just begging for the head hunters to eat them for dinner.Here’s an hastily improvised screen-shot highlighting a comparison of the crime map for Chantilly versus Independence Avenue:STAY IN CHANTILLY!!!!!

        An enterprising White Man can still prosper.I recently concluded representation of an Indian company against a Chinese company. I am convinced the slimey lawyers for the Chinese passed on sealed trade secrets to their client. The Chinese thus stole their opponent’s IP.The Indian C-levels drove their Chinese counterparts mad with relentless hectoring motions and discovery which frequently interferred with business ops and large customer relationships.The Chinese knuckled under to the Indians but may have misappropriated core Indian tech thus making what they paid to settle an investment in Indian tech acquisition. The tech was pioneered by Japanese in any event.Wire payment transfers to the undersigned White dude all cleared. I’m the only one who is better off, and the Chinese and Indian parties each “lost.” I’m not even jewish. Consider.

            I would hate to learn that I’m first to inform you that neither company deserves to be allowed into one of our courtrooms except as a rightless defendant. Both are alien organizations. Further, a corporation is an imaginary person, and imaginary persons can’t have rights (which must be real to be counted as rights).During or after the revolution, all judges and court clerks responsible for that abomination will twist in the still air of their own offices and court rooms.  Collaborationist lawyers will be compelled to make the neck ties and to do the work of putting them on deserving necks.

        Occasionally I’ll watch what I now know as a reaction YouTuber known as the charismatic voice, where she’ll listen to some old rock star, critiquing his/her voice and making all sorts of faces etc. looking like she’s having an orgasm.  Then, while searching for other videos of her, I noticed similar types with some sambo/sambette doing the same – for White rock music.  Yeah sure, I’m going to watch some darkie mugging and yammering about classic rock, not.  Could be entertaining in a comedic sort of way though…

            I see those “reaction” videos show up in my youtube search feeds when I’m looking for some old-time musical artist. The thumbnails usually have some diversity, with dreadlocks and what I call a “constipated” expression on their face. No thanks. I tried watching a couple of those unctuous, performative click-bait videos several years ago, no thank you. I’ve got less annoying things to do with my time, like watch a Ben Shapiro lecture, lol!

                    One of the more common YT tropes in the comments sections for videos of classic white music is for some nuggress posting, “I’m a 30 year old black woman and I love Led Zeppelin!” As if she thinks she should receive a medal for not abominating great music made by whites. Alas, these solipsistic posts inevitably receive many upvotes and quite a few you-go-girl comments. I’ll leave something snarky and racist.

            They can play an entire song and keep their videos up and monetized.  Meanwhile, if you want to demonstrate an audio device (like a radio or CD player or something), 8 seconds of a copyrighted song in a 2 hour video will get demonetized or taken down or worse, monetized, but with the record company getting the money.  They are even doing it with video game music.It’s even worse with TV.  I follow a guy who repairs a lot of old CRT TVs.  When he demonstrates them working, he has to put on HSN, otherwise 5 seconds of video or audio from OTA broadcasts gets a copyright violation.It’s all a big stupid clownshow.

                I wonder how the big box stores manage when they’re demoing all their TVs on the floor. Must they pay royalties when they are probably just showing something from cable or satellite? Perhaps so.Lots of old films and other video can’t be released. We know why something like “Song of the South” hasn’t been released in decades but that’s a topic for another time. 😎 No I’m talking about programs that had licensed music or other copyrighted content that they would have to negotiate new licensing for. In many cases it’s probably not economical to even consider releasing the old stuff.

            The first phase of this was the cover playthrough video. At least the person was playing the drum or guitar part to a song. It did debauch music and make it impossible for original and unique creators to bubble up past the click bait of using a highly popular brand name to capture the attention of the knuckle draggers who once upon a time went to record stores to find new music.The second phase was black guys doing reaction videos to Metal. It had that tinge of black superiority in musical tastes. However, it was also funny because once they started reacting to modern heavy music the disposition changed. You could see it was undeniable that it is here where talent and conviction turned when the music industry was captured by low IQ lowest common denominator beats and kinder-melody.Nonetheless, back in ’15 you could see where this was headed. It was going to be a reaction video to a reaction to a reaction to video done by a woman wiggling her bosom.It isn’t new when it comes to mass man. It started with the 70s dance shows featuring some young pop wunderkind. Then it turned into karaoke on Star Search. Then it became American Idol and a million knock-offs.This is to Z’s point today. At some point the lowest common denominator and artificiality will no longer convey status. Like a feudal society, at some point taste will be cultivated behind the fire and castle walls of the feudal nobility. That won’t happen until the best at taking and holding physical space emerge. Include high competence in use and repair of drones and drone software in your self sufficiency kit.Imperium Press has a great series on The Coming Tribal Conflict. Part III came out recently and it is a banger.

                First, there is almost no chance of turning this around.  Do yourself a favor and look at all the top twitter accounts. They are all low IQ retards with 100s of millions or billions of followers.  People are stupid and vapid and love stupid and vapid things. It’s why video shorts are so popular.Second, in my experience, I have to specifically put cover in a song title to get any cover versions high in the search results.  Frankly, some of it is pretty good.  There is a band called Leonid and Friends who do Chicago, EW&amp;F and one offs like a Carpenters song.  They are spectacular.  All Russian.

        Reaction to the reaction video recursion is a fun genre sometimes.
Asmongold is a YT that plays a whole video from another channel and pauses to make commentary making a 45min video of a 15min original video. You can see live comments of the original airing of the comment to comment and they can be hilarious.

            This was what youtube was originally for.  Reply videos were a staple of youtube.  There were some lively debates back in the day.  One person would put up a video with their hot take on some random topic and then someone would download the video and then play clips from the original video and then say why they were a moron for saying that.  If I understand it correctly, youtube itself helped facilitate this through a setting which is now gone.  The star system is long gone too. Now even the up down ratio is gone.

                Right you are, and Asmongold as a reply videographer is just plain fun to watch.  Actually, he’s a blast.  Just a gamer on the make.

        Ok, so how ought children to be raised so that they do not become brittle vessels filled with slop and stained by slop? If they are raised right, most of them will not deviate from a correct path as adults except for brief excursions during occasional lapses, which we ought to expect from any inherently fallible being.This is a difficult problem for a moral relativist to answer. What criteria can such a person admit into his system of education without making use of a stolen concept? How can he tell the kids that habitual dissembling is an evil way, the way of Shemitizers, democrats, corporate capitalists, joggers, feminists, queers, secular humanists, Flattards, and other pests whom the kids will never need in their lives?

I just cannot imagine how much worse our phones would be if Chinese spoke English.  Thankfully, pretty much all antisocial  media is banned in China with serious consequences (if caught and if they want to prosecute) for using a firewall to access them.This is why God made the nations. We are supposed to live separately in our own lands.  Trade, tourism, sure. Temp work visas and immigration, absolutely not.  Even in small numbers they will always agitate for themselves and their people and always compare the shitholes they left favorably to our countries and bitch about it.

        (a) The civil right to religious liberty.“The Council further declares that the right to religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person… This right to religious freedom is to be recognised in the constitutional law whereby society is governed. Thus it is to become a civil right.”2 (Declaration on Religious LibertyDignitatis Humanae,paragraph 2)What is more, the Vatican II “popes” took steps to ensure that, in countries where such freedom was not already a “civil right”, it became one. Thus the Catholic constitutions of Spain and Colombia were suppressed at the express direction of the Vatican, and the laws of those countries changed to permit the public practice of non-Catholic religions.And as though to refute as clearly as possible the attempts of certain misguided “conservative” members of the Conciliar Sect to explain away the text cited above, interpreting it in some quite incredible fashion, Karol Wojtyla never misses an opportunity to inculcate his own – surely accurate – interpretation of the Council’s intention. For instance in February 1993 he declared, in the predominantly pagan African Republic of Benin, that “the Church considers religious liberty as an inalienable right…”The correct doctrine, which popes have often reiterated, is most authoritatively stated in the following passage fromPope Pius IX’sQuanta Cura(1864):“And from this wholly false idea of social organisation they do not fear to foster thaterroneous opinion, especially fatal to the Catholic Church and the salvation of souls, called by our predecessor,Gregory XVI, insanity, namely that the liberty of conscience and worship is the proper right of every man, and should be proclaimed by law in every correctly established society… Each and every doctrine individually mentioned in this letter, by Our Apostolic authority We reject, proscribe and condemn; and We wishand commandthat they be considered as absolutely rejected byallthe sons of the Church.”Almost the only label thatPope Pius IXdoes not attach to this doctrine is in fact that of “heresy”, but he clearly thought the “insanity” he spoke of to be heretical for he says that it contradicts Divine Revelation. Moreover, this notion of religious liberty had already been expressly qualified as heretical byPope Pius VIIin his briefPost Tam Diuturnas, so there is no doubt about the matter.Theological Censure:HERETICAL.

        Currently I’m happy to pay Kagi $10/month for unlimited search of much better quality than one gets from Google.
It’s no-nonsense search. Can read about ithere.
I’m not affiliated in any way.
That being said, I do re-evaluate all my subscriptions every month or two and prune ruthlessly. Fast-moving field and all that.

        Twitter needs to implement user filtering options, one of which could be regional IP address blocks, e.g. a user can block or mute posts originating from IP addresses in India.

        Z’s analogy to the tragedy of the commons is very apt. In actuality the commons works very well but only in the situation where in economic terms supply (pasture) vastly exceeds demand (nomads). That works fine in prehistoric times or or such places where people are very sparse. But once you have increasing populations you have competition for limited resources leading to claims to property ownership, disputes, wars and all the other baggage that civilization brings.As an aside it is worth mentioning that communism or socialism can work in the real world but only in very restricted circumstances such as a convent or monastery that is self supporting. The key here is that the entire membership is self-selected, rarely if ever imposed upon entire populations.Mapping this back to the internet I don’t know what the the future holds. Probably some electronic version of a fortified medieval city, where the the peasants farm on the outside and, if they’re lucky, some may find shelter within the stone walls on those times when barbarians come to call. A major problem with such a world is that, while there may be trade between cities it’s on much more primitive terms than what we have come to think was normal in our modern world.

Neofeudal Review makes a compelling argument Trump has cut a deal and sold out:
https://neofeudalreview.substack.com/p/trump-20-has-already-stolen-more
I also find the relative lack of MSM outrage over Trump and Melania coin telling.

            Saw that, but nah. The Coins were sold to willing buyers, not some secretive theft through a USAID cutout. There is a difference, the telling difference.
Didn’t harm me in the slightest.  It wasn’t used to hurt my people, or white children.  That’s all that matters.

        Finally caught the RAMZ show.The thing this week with the two pictures of the dude was a total “black pill”—about /ourguys/. The question was about twophotographs, not about twomen. In other pictures that same guy looks completely different, but in the two that were initially offered, the “before” was obviously the more sexually appealing—to women.So many supposed aesthetes of the right couldn’t see that the “after” picture was of a tiny gay nerd. That’s not what the guyis(probably), but that’s what thepictureis—unmistakably. That picture wants to marry a single mom so he can rape her son. All the talk of women’s other, extra-pictorial thoughts was bullshit. It was apicture of a child molester.“Right-wingers are secretly all faggots” stonks are way up.
