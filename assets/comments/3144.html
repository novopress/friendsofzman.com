        The existence of the Left is dependent on appropriating money from Producers to give to Consumers using the muscle of the State. It’s a bribe, no? Vote for us and we will give you Free Stuff. What happens when there is no longer enough money for all the promises? What happens when the State itself goes belly up? Or is forced by the economics of the situation to become a much smaller version of itself, unable to provide Free Stuff? What will make people fall into line behind Leftism then? I think that whoever has made the most promises that will not be kept is going to see its future waning. So, James Wilson, I think we will just have to agree to disagree.

        It will not happen that way Kathleen. Cycles occur within like environments. The environment has changed. Universal suffrage is a revolutionary instrument, and nothing but. Both public and private discussion is continually corrupted until no one can learn even from disaster. The left has won because they understand what democracy actually is. They may not understand that they too are committing suicide, but they may not care.

        James Wilson: it is typically human to believe that since something has continued for some time that it will continue for the foreseeable future. We are always fighting the last war. But movements come, have their heyday, and eventually recede. Another movement takes it’s place and the cycle is repeated. Leftist thought and policy has infected the nation for about a hundred years now, slowly gaining ground until it has reached the pinnacle of power. It may have another few years to enjoy the fruits of its poisonous labor, but the seeds of its destruction have already been sown. We are broke, and once everyone acknowledges that, once reality is in everyone’s face, then the State, and the symbiotic relationship with Leftism cannot survive in its present Leviathan form.

        Oh, no, Kathleen. The disease is gaining ground, and not incrementally. There is no longer a benefit to be had by learning from failure. Centralization never had a good day, but it had a heyday when it could still exist on the momentum of a great civilization.  We’re eating the seed corn now.I hadn’t read those questions which Zman raised about Hoffer’s life, so I may simply not have very good information. But what I have read is that he claimed his mother died while holding him in a fall down the stairs in their home when Hoffer was five, after which he lost his sight for several years. I had taken the great leap to assume that he caused his mothers death and developed hysterical blindness as a result. So far as I am aware, he had no relationships with women other than prostitutes.My reading of Hoffer’s works suggest to me that he had identical views to your own about blue collar union men as well as professional progressives.  Also, although he was an atheist he was more kindly disposed toward the religious than he was toward atheist in general.

        I agree. Just like centralization, Leftism has seen its best days. The apex has been reached and it’s all down hill from here. Until another generation or two passes and people forget just how much of a failure Leftist policies are. When times are good and people think the future looks bright, they will let their guard down and once again allow the Leftists to go for the brass ring. Who says history doesn’t repeat?
