        Twice before there existed here, in the Land of Israel, sovereign Jewish kingdoms, and the beginning of the collapse of both kingdoms began in the eighth decade of their existence. Both kingdoms existed for about 220 years
Oh no!
To be honest, I am getting a little sick of their shenanigans.

            How is that any different from Louis Farrakhan’s numerology? The superstition is much more prevalent than the math.

            I don’t care what the Israelis and Muslims do to each other.  I just don’t want to pay for it.  $26 billion for Gaza war.  NY is spending $5 billion to redo JFK airport.  The US could redo 5 major airports for what we spent last year on Israel.  And I don’t want to think about what we could build for the $200 billion sent to Ukraine.  Or the trillions sent to Iraq and Afghanistan.

                They are also only going to contract with non-white businesses and labor. Whites will be excluded from all JFK contracts.This is related. Whites are needed and desired as canon fodder for the Great American Satrapy. So we get excluded from the contracts that our tax dollars will fund. We are needed and wanted to fight and die for another country while ours is left undefended.What a bargain!We have leverage if we choose to organize and use it. Per my post above, the GAE ends the day we walk away. Sorry. We are too busy fending off the 20,000 Haitians you just dumped into our town to fight for Zion.

                    Einstein,(when he was not urging FDR to make the A-bomb to use on Germany) was a pacifist, and once wrote “If men refused the draft, the jails would not hold them all.” This possibility is all the more likely given Title 9 which demands equal shares for both sexes, plus the presence of female admirals and generals(and even fighter pilots and Green Berets)in the military- if they are not subject to the draft, the men may well refuse this time, and if they are, women may finally wake up to what double MOH  winner and General Smedley Butler wrote: “War is a Racket.”

                    Annuities for participants, a two-fer to push that D, E and I with extra $.Look for rework, budget overruns, added funding requests for the rubber stamp overseers.Do not expect scheduled completion as that is self-defeating.

                    So true- Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) were both rebuilt in less time than it will take, IMJHO, to re-build the Francis Scott Key Bridge, toppled by a tanker merely bumping into a pier.

                        The same thing that we do when groundwater which enabled desert farming depletes.  It will be no longer viable. It will be abandoned.  Places like Saudi Arabia had a ton of these farms. The ground water was used up and the places were abandoned.America has tons of abandoned places.  She’s strewn with old mining towns, for example.  Without the mining, the town is simply not viable and the town is abandoned.If the grid becomes unreliable to the point of say, South Africa’s grid, the places that reach these absurd levels of heat will be uninhabitable.  Air conditioning is what made these places metropolises in the first place.

                            Yea agree but those areas you mentioned had time to be abandoned where if the grid goes down a lot of people are going to suffer and die which is why I directed that question at him since he lives in the southwest…I think people think it’s not really a possibility otherwise how could you know your place where you reside isn’t tenable if it happens…

                                Nah, people will leave. People aren’t just going to sit in their house waiting to die.  They’ll drive out of there.  Maybe some will, but most won’t.  Sady, the “some” would most likely be seniors.Some will stay.  Solar could make it viable if you have to be there for some reason, though it would be expensive.  The large number of people leaving will ease the pressure on infrastructure.  Like if water shortages started causing people to leave, that will greatly ease the shortage.  There are people today in America with no running water. They have a truck with a 500 gallon water bottle which they fill up in town.

                                        Well, in terms of electricity, I would assume load shedding would come before collapse.  Same with water.  You get 2 hours of water and/or electricity a day and that’s it.  This would be likely to drive out anyone who could afford to leave.  Who the hell wants to live in an environment that can easily reach 110f with no air most of the day and limited water?
I’m not sure of the likelihood of total grid failure in any particular area in the US.  Perhaps it is way more likely than I believe it to be?

                                    A large fraction of the Southwest is entirely reliant on Federal water projects much of it from the Colorado river. Much of that infrastructure is nearly a century old. The quality of the engineers that designed it and the people that built it is long gone and won’t be coming back. Even maintaining it is a big question mark. A major electrical failure is only one of several things that could cripple part or all of that network.

                    Speaking of which, here in Houston, your average thunderstorm routinely knocks out power (a dozen+ times this year alone, without one major hurricane yet), largely due to neglect of the most basic maintenance: cutting trees near power lines- and yet, 100 years ago, when Americans built the first real urban power grid, in Panama, as part of the canal infrastructure, they knew enough to bury all the lines. A dreary example of the decline of civilization, for all the advances in technology.

        Actuarial tables play a major role. Israel exists due to American largesse, and the support of elderly voters who elect easily bribed pro-Zionist politicians. The Silents almost all are gone now and the Boomers are right behind them. The younger cohort following the Boomers has been exposed to different propaganda and a different reality. Even the Evangelical Cult has younger members who see the Kagan Cult for what it is, and they conflate, sometimes wrongly, Club Kagan with Club Israel.Add to the mix Muslims imported with Jewish connivance, ironically enough. That cohort exerts outsized political power in key swing states such as Michigan. Islamic Centers are the new Holocaust Museums. Closely related, the wide-open border makes the United States basically unable to piss off Muslims, among others, due to inevitable terrorist cells who have noted they can just walk into the country. The mandarins for the Ruling Class realize it is not Appalachia that will go all ‘splodey if the United States decides to lose a war in Iran.As to that last point, Israel sees the rank ineptitude of the American military (its own is a mere shadow of its former self). If the Goy Brigades even would enter into a conflict on Israel’s behalf, the mincing tranny brigades probably could not prevent a full-scale assault on Our Gayest Ally. Whether intended or not, the People’s Liberation Army base in nearby Djibouti no doubt would serve as a trip wire just as much as Russia’s Tarsus Naval Base if things jump off and also draw that country into conflict.Israel’s decision to go for the gold is a harbinger of things to come. Old hatreds and long-suppressed and simmering conflicts will re-emerge as the GAE recedes. For all the bad it has done in the world, the GAE also has kept somewhat of a lid on regional wars and rivalries (yes, it exploited and caused many, too). Situations similar to the bloodbath in South Asia that followed Britain’s decision to decolonize the Subcontinent will be realized many times over in the years to come. Westerners will not be immune at all as the alien populations that flooded their countries support their co-nationals through proxy conflicts in the nations they invaded. This already has happened in London as Hindus and Muslims go at it just like the kin folks back in Delhi.The post-Empire outlook is not good.

            It seems like a frantic throw of the dice. The IDF is a spent force as far as its ground forces are concerned. They really got chewed up badly in Gaza. Heading into Lebanon will be catastrophic for them…unless they use nukes on Hezbollah’s tunnel system. I don’t know how well they would actually work. But using nukes would definitely be the signal for a war that could easily spiral completely out of control. There is a touch of insanity driving the Israelis.

Too many White folk [particularly White females] are swallowing way too many pills every day to be able to get in touch with their instincts.

                            Our entire illegal immigration, at least the Overland portion could be easily solved by a no man’s land at the border. Firing positions could be staffed by Citizen Soldier volunteers providing their own arms and other equipment. It wouldn’t cost the military a cent. Just make the rules of engagement fire at will and shoot to kill. You would completely solve the Border problem at no more cost to the government than the cost to eminent domain the No Man’s land.

                    Not really. Who is going to retaliate? The only one that -might- take that gambit is Pakistan but they don’t really love other Muslims enough to send canned sunshine onto distant Israel.No actually Israel is perhaps one of the only countries that could successfully deploy a nuke without a retaliatory nuclear strike. You specifically mention “the powers that be” but that is non-sensical. They would not only tolerate it but would probably be happy with Tehran as a smoking crater. (Assuming you are referring to Western Powers)Had you said the Arab countries would retaliate conventionally, then yes, assuredly that would happen but the Powers That Be could care less.What you said doesn’t compute…

                It is certainly a possibility.   Bibi recently said that he thought Israel could overcome its’ opposition in Southern Lebanon in about “one week.”  10 months of a meatgrinder with Hamas and he thinks he could quickly overcome Hezbollah?
I don’t know any way to interpret that except tactical nukes are on the table.

Seems like a crazy suicide run. A decade.or so ago they had improving relationships with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf States. Could have made a peace deal in Gaza. Instead, they chose chaos and war – but it isn’t 1967 any longer when they could beat the rest of the Middle East.

            I think this relationship goes way back. The Jews always seemed to get along with the Ottomans. The Ottomans stayed in power cultivating janissaries.

                                    Jews got along well with the Turks during the days of the Ottoman Empire.
That is FACT.
If you want to call my speculating that those patterns and connections and friendly relations carry over to today as “opinion,” knock yourself out, but I believe they do.
Just look at how the EUnuchs tried to hasten the destruction of Yugoslavia. They couldn’t wait to recognize Slovenia and Croatia. Austro-Hungarian Empire connections live on. Similar thing with the Turks and the Jews.

                                        “Jews got along well with the Turks during the days of the Ottoman Empire.”That is not a fact.“A census conducted by the Ottoman chancery in 1584 returned 348,773 self-identified Jews living within the Ottoman Empire’s borders,” would be a fact if existing primary sources proved such a census was conducted and produced those returns.“In the year 1396 sultan Bayazid granted Jews living in the city of Bursa the right to lend money at an interest rate of 7.75% per annum,” would be a fact if extant primary sources proved Bayazid issued that edict that year.“A report commissioned by the Ottoman Imperial Council in 1426 found that Turks committed 40 acts of violence against self-identified Jews within the Empire’s borders that year,” would be a fact if surviving historical documents proved the Council commissioned the report that year and that its findings matched the statement.Your statement about Jews “getting along well” with Turks during Ottoman days, on the other hand, is little more than subjective opinion. Got along well in what ways? How does one measure getting along well? Got along well compared to how they got along with whom?Now your statement may well be broadly true just as “it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all” may be true, but neither are factual insofar as both may be reasonably contested.

            By Green Light, that means assurances from the juice that run the US that the US will fall in line and do what Israel wants.
My only question is whether the American draftees for Jew wars will give them the middle finger.  I hope so.

        I despise conspiracies, but there’s a pretty plausible one floating around that Trump was supposed to be taking a dirt nap, the blame was going to be pinned on Iran, Bibi was set to come up and give a rah-rah war speech (Biden not up for it), and we were going to do Gulf War 3.0.
Nothing like a splendid little war to unite Americans, right?

That’s what I’ll call an “optimistic take”.They wouldn’t even need a majority, just “enough”, and it just so happens that they would be the regimes most fanatical cheerleaders.

Belay that. There’s the TempoNick “staged” theory, which should be hurled aside with great force.

                Yep. Occam’s Razor does not support the lone gunman theory in this case. I saw a cell phone video yesterday which purported to show “Crooks” being shot while Trump was still speaking. Couldn’t tell if legit.

                Oh come on! He’s parading around with a bandage on his ear as if he won the purple heart or something. And then two days later everybody forgets about it. If this assassination attempt was real, people would still be talking about it. You’re smarter than that.

                    Not sure what pic’s you’ve seen—or imagined more likely—but Trump lost the bandage after the Convention.  This is why you (TempoNick) lack credibility in your assertions—you lack facts and gravitas.

                        And you think that makes me to lose credibility? I thought somebody shot a hole through his ear and is bandage is off already? If anything, it proves the assassination was fake and gay.
I’m not following this election very much. I already know Trump’s positions and they have him on monotone and acting like a regular politician so it’s boring for me. Once he starts insulting people again, I might pay attention.

                            No, the bullet through the ear is again *your* supposition/misunderstanding.  The wound could be little more than a scratch to the back of the ear—which would explain the current lack of markings on the visible outer part of the ear.I’ve had the back of my ear cut shaving.  It bled like a stuck pig.  I take daily aspirin.  Would not surprise me if Trump does too.  His bleeding was really not that bad, I’ve had worse.  Lots of show, nothing to worry about. Not different from a nose bleed.  Mostly embarrassing in many situations.  For Trump, a great PR gimmick—assuming you live.  He did.

                Doesn’t really have to be staged when there have probably been many times that we don’t know about where someone tried to take Trump out. They couldn’t tell us about it because it would make him ‘humanized’ as those crones from The View call it.
We should probably be more amazed that this one was the first who got to take a shot.

Isn’t the simplest explanation that against long odds a lone nut actually did get up on a rooftop and take shots at Trump? Three improbable contingent events (1) a suicidal marksman (2) that he was able to get into position unopposed, and (3) Trump’s miraculous Escape each very improbable even considered in isolation. That doesn’t change the fact that any conspiracy theory is of necessity orders of magnitude more complex and thus less probable.

                You let the lone nut do what he’s going to do. Or put women in charge, apparently.
Even the bit about explosives isn’t that sophisticated these days, and Crooks doesn’t sound like he was a dullard. Nebulous details, not that I’ve looked into it lately, so I’m kind of skeptical about that part anyway.
Regardless, doesn’t sound like anything a troubled but otherwise competent guy couldn’t do if everybody is looking the other way.

            “I despise conspiracies,”  I felt that way for most of my life.  I calmed my suspicions with “Don’t ascribe to malevolence that which can be explained by incompetence.”
Now, I believe that “malevolence &lt; incompetence” depended on my belief that most people who could affect me were mostly honest and well-meaning.  Most people had no particular hostility towards me or the group that they put me in.
If there are people out to harm you or your group,“malevolence &lt; incompetence” blinds you.

        The essential lesson of the Israeli assassinations in Beirut and Tehran is that killing someone by remote control is now a practical reality due to modern technology. And this process has been evolving ever since the Cheney Administration started using Predator drones for similar ends in the wake of 9/11. And it doesn’t even need to be expensive anymore, as is being demonstrated in Ukraine. You can’t take a peaceful shit in a trench latrine without an FPV dropping a grenade on your ass. You would think that this should be a lesson to the assholes ruining the world right now. Methnks turnabout is fair play.

                You make a very good argument that compulsory education, and the mischief attendant in part to teacher’s unions, has produced a generally semi-literate citizenry, further degraded by popular TV. I never fail to be amazed at what Abe Lincoln learned at home, or Sam Houston, who, for all the characterization as a rough and ready frontiersman, had read the classics voraciously, once taught in a one-room schoolhouse, and was so enamored of the Greek ideal that he saw in the American native Indian that as a young man he lived with them (and after being elected to Congress once gave a speech that was so eloquent that the leading Shakespearean actor of the day, Junius Booth, came down from the visitor’s gallery to hug him. But the evils you decry do indeed come from democratically elected politicians. The Constitution defines our republic. Ben Franklin, emerging from the Constitutional Congress debates in Philadelphia, asked, “What kind of government do we have?” “A republic…if you can keep it,” he replied. Implying that rule by the mob would become mob rule.

        With all my heart I wish Israel to disintegrate. Only when the state of Israel dissolves back into Palestine will there be anything approaching peace in that region. Perhaps we should allow the Turks to run things in the region, as there was little conflict between Jew and Arab at that time. I have no answer. We seem to be headed to a regional war of annihilation between Israel and Hezbollah, with one side or the other emerging victorious. But if Iran steps in, we could see Israel using its nukes, thus dragging in Russia and China. Best strap yourselves in for a wild ride.

            No.
2% of 335 million is roughly 7 million. Add another 7 million to our population and you get 4% Jew.
If Israel disintegrates, they’re coming here.

                Then total destruction of the Israeli nation will have to be the outcome. And in that case, the madmen running Israel will fire nukes at random into European capital cities in an act of final vengeance and hatred. They’ve stated they would do as much…the Samson Option. We’re dealing with something demonic.

                That’s the problem with dual citizenship.  We didn’t used to have it, now it’s all too common for Israelis.  The American “hostages” in Gaza for example are dual citizens.  There are IDF folk in that situation as well, but we do not react to this *treason*.
On the other hand, so what?  We are adding your number now through legal and illegal immigration.  Sigh….

                    P.S. I’ve toyed with the idea of getting dual citizenship. As unstable as this world is and considering that we are well beyond peak empire, it’s not a bad insurance policy. I bet you’re eligible for dual citizenship from Italy if you look into it. If nothing else, if they start hijacking airplanes again, they’re probably not going to whack you around too much if you have a non American passport to show.

                            1)Natural born citizens in most nations don’t have that option. I’m an American several generations back. I might be able to get a passport from Canada (maybe), but only because it was settled by the same stock as Americans. Any European nation is off the table. Congrats on the paper citizenship somewhere else. I have an actual nation to worry about.2)It’s mostly Jews who spend a lot of time trying to up keep any recent legal ties they may have to keep open the option to skedaddle in a hurry. It explains their indifferent advocacy of change. They only have one foot here and will never be responsible for the consequence of their actions.In other words, there is no more “Jewy” sort of hot take than “Hurry up get your 2nd passport for when it all crumbles here.” If you are a Jew or not, I don’t know, although I know they are quite fond of trolling people and about the Jewish question itself. If you’re not Jewish, I would suggest to stop advocating for their stereotypical behavior. It is disruptive.

                                Mine would come from the former Yugoslavia. People do it for a variety of reasons. Some do it for sentimental reasons, others as an insurance policy, still others just think it’s cool to have. Each situation depends on individual.

                                    And? Lots of Jews come from Eastern Europe. If you don’t want to be called out for highly Jewish behavior, I’d suggest stop claiming to be doing that.In my experience it’s mostly Jews who think it’s “fun” and/or “cool” to have 2nd passport. Jews would also see it as an insurance policy, as they are forever seeing life through the eyes of a traveler, rather than a home builder.There will be some Gentiles of course, but they would mostly be mulattos/immigrants. In other words they are natural born citizens of no nation. Members of actual nations would have no use for a 2nd passport.

                        Actually, I’m Dutch and *was* eligible until age 30 to apply.  I did not.  I do not fault people using your logic, but in those days I was pretty much a “gung ho” American.  So was my father which is how I was raised.  He emigrated and dropped all connections when he took the oath of citizenship.  That’s why I’m not totally against legal immigration of meritorious new, and in the main, White citizens.

                                A second passport means you’re mostly from either Yugo or Slava, and quite possibly Jewish. Yes, of course it has impact. You’re not an natural born citizen of America. It makes American a giant open air shopping mall for you.I have an affinity for the American nation precisely because I am an American without the asterisk.

                            As an American founding stock, I’d appreciate it if can turn off the spigot at this point. The Dutch are a part of the founding stock in the US, so the blend will come pretty easily. If we’re talking refugee Afrikaners especially, okay. But this talk of “meritorious immigration” is what got us in trouble in the first place.

                                I’ll argue with you there, but you’re not alone in such thinking.  Sometime around the great 1964 revision of the quota system for immigration was also a clause put in for “family reunification”.In essence, you—as a learned person from wherever, after citizenship, can sponsor for immediate immigration family members—regardless of their usefulness to this country.  I’ve heard that this provision alone multiplies immigration of so called “legal” immigrants 10x’s over.One of the most useful changes to current “legal” immigration law is the halt of this practice, or at the very least a process of immigration—really residency—that can not, by law, lead to citizenship, welfare, and voting rights—ever!

                                    I don’t agree with this at all. If you let someone into this country, they need to have all the benefits any other American has and that means having your own family and social circle as your safety blanket to get you through the hard times you’re going to encounter. This mentality creates a nation of a different type of ferals without a familial support system around them.

The Israelis are coming here.Perhaps that was what Netanyahoo was greasing the skids for, in the back room discussions.
And, they’ll have a whole new Holocaust narrative ready when they arrive.

            “Perhaps we should allow the Turks to run things in the region, as there was little conflict between Jew and Arab at that time.”
Bring back the Ottoman Empire, I agree.  This is an unexpected insight, Gotterdam-it-all.
Remember, it’s official fall was 1924, 100 years ago.  Surely there is something left.

        Even at its post WW2 peak, say 1990, the GAE military machine would not have been able to conquer or occupy Iran. Roughly 3x size of Iraq, 3x population, mostly mountainous terrain, and without a convenient cross border staging area like in Gulf War I. It’s questionable if they could have done it in 1944. In light of this, one is left to wonder what “winning” a war with Iran is supposed to look like. Assange would tell us the war is not meant to be won, but from the Israeli perspective, and presumably they are the ones pushing for it, there does not seem much benefit to a perpetual war. Indeed, the longer war with Iran went on, the greater the peril Israel would be in. It seems a safe assumption that they want this war to be won. But how? Some stand off missile strikes aren’t going to do it. They can’t even beat the Houthis that way. Unless it’s a certain kind of missile they have in mind.

            I saw that incorrigible warmonger and faggot Lindsey Graham is out again agitating for strikes on Iran’s oil refineries.  I genuinely can’t understand if he’s saying this because he thinks it’ll work or, like Z-Man mentions frequently, it’s because he lacks any sort of second order thinking.  Perhaps he’s just playing the mad dog role like Medvedev in Russia does.  Either way, I’m sure the American people will love paying $8+/gal for gasoline so that our compromised zio-slave politicians can feel like tough guys.

            Iran would be our sclerotic Empire’s Afghanistan (the one that crippled the Soviet Union, not our later adventure there). I think the US would lose in Iran faster than the Soviets did in Afghanistan though because they would be fighting not only irregulars but a pretty competent and modern state. The security arrangements with Russia and (I think) now China would make this adventure doubly idiotic.

On a serious note, this all falls apart if American men, that is to say, European descended men, give them what they said they wished for – no more of them. The GAE ends tomorrow when we just stay home.

        Israel can hardly afford to stay in the game if Iran starts playing by their same rules (and contra Z’s point about the assassinations, Israel has spent the last several decades killing Iranian scientists).  A slow assault of assassination drones would make life unlivable for them.  How many politicians would Iran have to hit before they’re all living in a bunker?  I doubt it’s more than half a dozen.

            That’s the Jews-eye view of things. In fact, Jordan and Egypt have diplomatic relations with Israel; both are heavy recipients of U.S. aid. They will not attack Israel no matter what their people want (and Jordan’s population is heavily Palestinian). Syria has been comprehensively defeated by Israel in prior wars and no longer responds in kind to even the most open provocations. Likewise, the Jews and Zionism have never enjoyed such unconditional support in the U.S. Even European governments run interference for their actions in Gaza. We need to disabuse ourselves of the idea that Jewish behavior towards non-Jews is a response to existential threats. In reality, it is only when Jews are in dire straits that they behave even remotely decently towards gentiles.

                As the Zman said, “the Middle East has had tyrants since Ur of the Chaldees,” since tyranny is the only language the entire West-South Asian region of hybrids understands.
The good news: Blue eyed blonde people came to israel from Iran 6500 years ago, DNA shows, from a massive bonepile in a Galilee necropolis.An “Arab” from Iran in the year 721 was portraitured having blonde hair.Long before it was Semitic Arab, the Mideast was Hellenic.

                    I don’t disagree with your prognosis, just the immediate cause. It is Jewish internal politics, no longer neighboring Arab countries’ active hostility, that largely feeds the current Israeli–Arab conflicts. Of course, as Israel’s Western protectors weaken—in no small part due to Jewish diaspora subversion and warmongering—a Saladin could well rise up.

        Bibi understands that it is now or never regards the greater Israel project.   The GAE grows weaker by the day and despite what the folks at the Conservative Treehouse think Trump will not be able to fix that.The 10/07/23 attack was obviously allowed to happen so Israel could get rid of its’ Palestinian problem and launch their long planned war of expansion.   Their problem is they have bitten off more than they and Uncle Sugar will be able to chew.The GAE as configured today is inevitably going to decline.   Go to war with Russia, China or Iran and that decline will probably come about more quickly that any of our betters can understand.As Col. Macgregor and other thinking men have said, there are no more easy wars left to fight for the GAE.

            The US won’t be able to withstand supply chain disruptions, nor the economic shockwaves. Perhaps global capital flies into the US. If not, it is game over. Or, Japan could decide that an alliance with China is better than undergoing forced negrification at the behest of the GAE.White men would be better off immigrating on boats to Ireland or England. Then they can join forces with Irishmen and Englishmen to fight the true existential war for OUR civilization. Help them de-colonize their homelands. Then filled with the high of homeland reclamation, someday they or their sons can return and do the same on our continental homeland.

        Well it’s clear we’re being pushed to go to war. Ukraine failed to register with the public. Russia was smart to concentrate on Ukraine-only. The pin-prick terrorist attacks funded and orchestrated by Washington (Nordstream, Moscow theater, etc.) were absorbed by Russia, also a smart play. That avoided a monstrous conflict with nukes.Iran will do the same. Or maybe a couple of missiles for show like last time.They know something the Wizards of Smart haven’t even considered: citizens who won’t even protest the grotesque abuses of their government in the US are no threat to Russia and Iran.A people that is too lazy and stupid to defend itself is a fickle ally at best.I suspect the Israelis also know this. So why not kill some enemies knowing there won’t be any significant retaliation because Iran knows it is safe as long as it shows restraint.Of course, all the usual suspects in the US will blow their war trumpets.  But nobody will listen and it’ll mostly be used for fundraising.  The neocons aren’t going to get their Final Battle.The only way the war widens is a military attack on US soil. And that simply won’t happen. Not yet. We’re not weak enough for that.Yet.

        Good article. Except for…“they understand how the neocons use Zionism as a cover”I think you mixed up the syntactical order here. Zionists use evangelical Christians and neocons as cover, not the other way around.Evangelicals get nothing out of this arrangement. They used to say America got oil and that would have made some sense I suppose… but that was too obvious of a lie so they had to stop. Same with the WMD excuse.But Israel gets Christian soldiers and Trillions of US dollars to fight their middle eastern enemies for them.Pretty great deal for jews. Pretty bad deal for Christians and America in general.

        The Zionist project could well go the way of prior experiments in Jewish autonomy. At present Zionists are preeminent in the West, especially the U.S., where its ethnics are almost universally revered. But their presence in our nations has fatally weakened us just as their throwing open the gates of Toledo aided the fall of the Visigoths. Their Neocon (Trotskyite) element provoked a conflict with Russia together with sanctions that will result to the eventual de-dollarization of trade. This need not have been fatal but for the offshoring of our manufacturing base to China. Now for the eternal question: “How does this affect the Jews?” Israel provoking Iran at a time when what’s left of U.S. industry is unable to keep up with the material demands even of the Ukraine war—not to mention a Neocon struggle with China over Taiwan—means we will be hard-pressed to support them in any conflict just now. Over time, Israel may have to look to Russia or China for support. Good luck with that! As with the ancient Israelites, modern-day Israel may well tear itself apart with internal conflicts (as evidenced before October 7th). Its nuclear weapons are about as useful as South Africa’s were in relation to its internal black population. The ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians might make some sense from an Israeli perspective; but a transfer of Palestinians to the West merely compounds their alliance dilemma. Of course, they could try behaving more like a normal people, both at home and abroad, but we see little sign of that.

        Something that hasn’t gotten any attention, at least as far as I know, how long before Israeli society and the country fall apart completely? Reservists called up, who does their jobs and how does the country function with so many workers gone? Their exports, either by boycott or just no production, are gone. How do they maintain a functioning economy? They still need a semblance of normal economic life.Also, a lot of productive people are leaving and the fanatics and drains on society(the ultra-Orthodox) remain. You can’t have a functioning country with just them. The rape scandal ought to be enough to get any decent person out of the country rather than be a party to that.When does it all end for them? It can’t continue indefinitely unless they know that and have a national suicide agenda.

        I hadn’t previously heard of “the curse of the eighth decade”; but I had reached a similar conclusion but expressed in terms of three generations.A human generation has traditionally been defined as 25 years. 3 X 25 = about 75 years; although recently in the developed world it is more like 30 years. 3 X 30 = 90 years – or a bit less, to account for the gradual change.This is (approximately) the time it takes for a false, incoherent ideology/ religion to work its way right-through a society, from bottom to top; the time taken for the children born-into the new regime, to have become the elders of the new regime.…Until what went before, has essentially died-out (at least as far as public discourse goes) – and the new regime must survive on its own aims and motivational resources.Of course, this only applies when there is a hard re-set; and the three generations clock does not properly start until the last of the old regime has died-out. For example, the USSR was a hard-reset of atheism in 1917 with the rapid genocide of bishops/ priest/ monks/ nuns and the devout (?10s of millions?).But when the West abandoned Christianity, the abandonment was incremental and took several generations – IMO (in the UK) the three-generation clock only started some times in the 1950s – three generations after-which takes us to… now.

                My black pill has centered around my mortality and that concept as well.  As common folk, we all are 3 generations away from total obscurity.  It will be as if we never existed. Even direct descendants will not remember us.  At best we’ll be a line item in an old records book, now in digital format.Such of course is different for those who have strived to rise above mediocrity.  Even that slime ball Biden will have schoolchildren reciting his name (along with the other Presidents) as an academic exercise in grade school—assuming nation status for an entity called America remains.I’m beginning to appreciate why the old Norsemen desired so hard to be in the people’s “saga’s”.

                            Depends what your religious beliefs are. I believe life is just an antichamber to something else. That’s why every civilisation (except our current one) has had religious belief. NDEs also give us the first glimmerings of scientific evidence for an after life. So, despite the craziness of the psychopaths, that’s why we shouldn’t get too down. All will be well, and all manner of things will be well.

I am continually amazed that among so much thoughtful analysis and stylish writing here, almost no comment takes account of the spiritual life, or even the findings of psychical research. God and the human soul are as absent in Zman’s followers as in Stalin’s USSR … no, even in the Soviet Union the call of the divine was only suppressed, not eliminated.

        80 years sounds like a pretty good estimate of living memory. I’d guess that’s the something to it. Demographics, along with economics, seem to be the big filters on human affairs imo. ‘Filters’ seems more appropriate than ‘influences’ to me, because they’re practical things.

            We’re about 80 years past WW2, the founding event/myth of Israel—and of all the rest of current_year. It’s recently becomeentirelymythological, a thing literally no one remembers and almost no one has reliable secondhand knowledge of. So its story has been rewritten.Old guys may not know (or believe) this: All surviving present regimes—including the Russian one—agree: The story of WW2 is oftemporary, forever fragile victory, achieved via massive blood sacrifice forced on resistant populaces, over the demonic nature of whiteness.The mission of globohomo (“GAE” greatly undersells it) is to secure this victory into eternity: End Whiteness.Fermi’s question answered.

        Iran does not have the military industrial capacity of Russia, but it does have the support of Russia and China. Iran can also count on Syria and Iraq to help deliver weapons and men to the border of Israel. She can also count on OPEC not coming to the rescue when oil prices double overnight. In other words, whatever the motivations, a regional war that drags in the American empire to fight Iran could very well be a catastrophe for the American empire.And with India’s BRICS membership, it’s quite likely that despite it’s long association with the Anglo countries, if a contract breaks out they’ll be all “What do you mean ‘we’ Caucasian man?”

        Maybe, just maybe, the Secret Service’s latest statement that another Shot is near certain within the next 30 days has something to do with the timing.

                Of course it is.  Many on here may not like E Michael Jones, and at first I was meh, but his assessments of the current scene are the most incisive.The likes of Jared Taylor and Sailer and the whole white thing and IQ thing was just a way to make the Jews invisible and/or to sell the IQ/life-outcomes pseudo science to naive white guys so that there was some type of science behind the fact that Jews ruled over them (it’s the IQ stupid!).  It was always there to simply throw them off the scent.  Quite clever.  Jared probably doesn’t even realize it’s what he’s doing, or maybe he does.On a related note, anyone else see the “white” thing as something of a homosexual grooming operation ?

            IQ was never and is not now the be all and end all.  Really, we are talking here of genetics where one aspect is intellectual inheritance.  But another inheritable trait is behavioral proclivities and these are also shaped by culture.

        I visited Rand’s website. DIE is at the top of the About page listings.
Jason MathenyPresident and Chief Executive Officer, RANDhttps://www.rand.org/about/diversity-equity-inclusion/presidents-message-on-diversity.htmlhe says:“I know that my background and life experiences do not reflect all the perspectives that RAND needs to succeed. By building a collective of broadly different experiences and backgrounds, we are generating better ideas, while avoiding groupthink and ideological or partisan leanings that can undermine the objectivity of our analysis.”
Could there be any more proof of group think than this sepuku committing race traitor? ChatGPT could do better than that at this point.

        When you’re a tiny little twerp on the global stage and all your neighbors are sworn to kill you, it’s good policy to keep them at one another’s throats instead of at yours.
“The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.” — from the hadith Sahih Muslim, 41:6985

        I say most, including Z-man, are not thinking clearly, and objectively, but emotionally. Bibi’s main objectives are to stay in power to stay out of jail, as Israel is very much divided as Z-Man has noted before. While not mapping to MAGA vs. Obama Country, the splits are roughly similar. Urban high income bureaucrat professionals vs. everyone else, with single women added to the Urban professariat.Bibi is not alone of course, and the Hamas Oct 7 shattered the old US “KKKrazy Glue” that Sailer noted kept people who hated each other in line mutually hating (and asset / position stripping) White guys.After Oct 7, the Coalition of the Ascendant (Alphabet+, non Whites, single White women, plus Jews) voted Jews off the island. There was a sustained (and in the fall renewed) effort to push Jews out of the Ivies and near Ivies: Penn’s protest was led by the daughter of a Philippines TV personality billionaire (her mother is some lawyer big shot associated the Biden regime). Similar stuff happened at Columbia, Harvard, Yale, USC, UCLA, etc. The aim was NOT stop the assault on Gaza but push Jews out of the upper tier colleges. People like Bill Ackman acted in alarm, fled to MAGA-country, as they understood that today’s non White female undergrads were tomorrow’s powerful bureaucrats taking their stuff and putting them in jail just like the OMB.Bibi and his coalition have concluded that Harris/Obama are the likely victors in November, with Maduro-like fraud and crackdowns so better act now. Trump will NOT be President, almost certainly. [That’s why Biden is ‘accepting’ Maduro’s victory — it is the Democratic template].There was of course no “deal” to release any hostages. Hamas cannot afford the survivors who have not been either starved / beaten to death; or killed by Israeli bombs, to speak about their torture, other things, and killings of fellow hostages. Thus killing the Senior Hamas leader who was also the lead negotiator is cost-free for Bibi. He was never going to get a deal, and he gets to look like the Armenians post WWI who tracked down the Young Turks and killed them, or the post-War Israelis hunting Eichman, or the US with Solemani (responsible for the Beirut barracks bombing). Putin btw is guaranteed to do the same thing with respect to the Crocus City Hall attacks.As for Hezbollah, the leaders there knew the rocket attack in Northern Israel that killed a bunch of people including kids would result in Israeli retaliation. It was as predictable as the Calendar.As for the brutal assaults on the prisoners (all Hamas btw) by the Israeli conscript soldiers, well this is what you get when you get Wars between religions/races/ethnicities. Is any one surprised? US troops after Malmedy did not accept SS surrenders. US troops in Iraq behaved similarly (poorly trained, often National Guard, holding “suspected terrorists”). Most Israelis don’t care or support the conduct, given that the prisoners were accused Hamas. [If they were, weren’t and just informants revenge, or somewhere in between beats me.] The Israeli peace movement is dead and will never come back after Oct. 7. The Urban professariat including Army commanders are fighting a rear guard action. The Army leadership was shown to be inept, stupid, and unimaginative in responding to Oct 7 behaving like Uvalde cops. The future in Israeli are the ultra Hardliners who are mostly Mizrahi. Not the aging Ashkenazi leadership.Just as in the Democratic Party, the leadership of aging people like Schumer and Pelosi are the past, the future is Obama, Ilhan Omar, AOC, Jaime Pressly, Rashida Tlaib, and Pramila Jayapal. That is who is sort of running things now during the Regency and will be running things fully next January under President Harris.Already the policy of the US is pro-Iranian. Obama has always tilted this way, giving Iran billions in cash on pallets (not kidding), easing sanctions, restricting Israeli actions, seeking to make Iran under the Ayatollah’s the main American proxy, just to repudiate White guys. The way Hamas protesters here burn American flags and curse America more than they protest Bibi. America is functionally a non-White country with non-White leadership that reflexively backs non-Whites like Hamas, or Iran, or Hezbollah against White Israel.THAT is ultimately why Bibi acted now. Come November, with the massive crackdown on YT, President Elect Harris will not tolerate anything White. That is just the nature of a non-White majority bureaucracy that makes. Policy. Turns out Huntington was right.[Hamas burns American flags and curses America because it believes Israel and the US are both “White” and must be destroyed, the same way White frat boys in “White” colleges in the South — Alabama, Auburn, Florida State, Georgia etc. saved the American flag and waved the Israeli one around — White identity. On both sides.]

            The tide may be slowly turning. The UK is currently experiencing no-shit major rioting, by “right wing extremists” of course. I only skim news reports, but you see the word “thousands” describing the demonstrators. I’d guess the response is comparable to the unrest following the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. One might describe the UK protests as not “mostly peaceful” but “not all violent”. Turns out a lot of Brits are unhappy that a 17-year old [probably] Muzzie got stabby last Monday mid-day. Seems the young man took offense at young girls at a dance class. Quite a death toll too: 3 dead, at least 6-7 wounded, some critically, including adults. Of course that’s far from the only such incident in recent years in Europe. Perhaps a critical mass has finally been reached and the legacy population has had enough. I say good luck chaps, burn it down, and perhaps start over. But you’ve got a very steep hill to climb, especially with the newly installed Labour government. After all, those non-whites have rights, whether they just got off the boat after illegally entering your land or they’re native-born citizens from alien cultures. In fact, they have more rights than you, you despicable working-class English white scum.This morning (08/04) RT reports that Elon Musk says that UK is headed for civil war. While the details are different, many other nations beset by idiotic immi-vasion may be at risk for similar upheaval. That tide may be turning. Alas, if the situation deteriorates badly, the tides will be shed human blood.

        Things are becoming clearer and clearer. It’s soooo satisfying to murder the Jews when they are helpless. After all it’s been satisfying for over 2000 years.Now that the Jews can beat back, the beating back is called “murder”. The top Hellsbollah guy Fuad Shukr just assasinated in Beirut, has been wanted by America for participating in suicide bombing of 241 American marines in 1983. America had $5M on his head since then.US should pay this $5M to the families of 12 Druze children murdered by Shukr several days ago while playing soccer in Golans.

            It’s still not clear exactly who killed them. It’s an even chance it was an Iron Dome rocket gone bad or an Israeli false flag. It’s no cost to them. The Druze are not human by their reckoning.

            Anna,War is coming.   If you are happy about that you should consider that the U.S. and Israel going to war with Iran could very well lead to WWIII.   There a a few ways this could happen.   One way is that if Iran moves to close the strait of Hormuz the Chinese may get involved.  They get a lot of oil via that route and they may come to the aid of Iran to prevent the closure.
There are other scenarios as well.  None of them would be good for the world.  So be careful what you wish for.
