        heh, might as well call it a lost cause. Shop owners should just leave and never come back. Let them subsist on government cheese for awhile and barter for Kools menthol’s with what they can steal from each other.

        I say Egg ’em on.
When the riots start, throw eggs.  Also water balloons. Show ’em that we take their 80 IQ antics seriously.

        And just as soon as the rioting stops….The shovel ready, minimum wage, “infrastructure”, union free,  employment office will open.“Special” consideration will be given to those “suddenly” able to produce ID suitable for voting in National Elections.Wonder how well “outsiders” will be “tolerated” then?

        The checks are a bribe to keep them from rioting.  If they can’t keep to the deal, if they are going to riot anyway, cut them off.  And yes, seal them off as well.

        If I were to hang fifty thousand people and it were to mark a great change for the better, they would almost without exception be Caucasian, have 1.2 children, and a masters degree.
The first thing I would do, and perhaps the only thing, is stop sending the checks. Idleness is more destructive than any other human condition. Rich and poor.
