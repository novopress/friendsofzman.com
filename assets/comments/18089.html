        Reality has no place in America today.
In the meantime, “Conservative Firebrand” Sen. Ted Cruz is ripping Gov Lee of Tennessee as racist for designating a “Nathan Bedford Forrest Day” in Tenn.
Trad America has no leadership and no representation in government.  We are alone in a sea of pandering mediocrity and cowardice.   Hooray for the Red White &amp; Blue.

            What’s happening in meatspace is not as frightening as the fringes world the media falsely presents us. We are meatspace based organisms – just a reminder.
The war on nature will fail.It will fail sooner and with less suffering the sooner we stand up.

                Whites are now set, w mathematical certainty, not counting something ‘very dramatic’, to become a minority in the US. W all the love for whitey you hear, why on earth would that worry anyone?? Well, I can think of a few reasons actually….

                    So?  Whites have always been a minority in the world, but that’s never stopped us from creating the greatest civilizations and the highest culture ever seen.  Even when it comes to killing, numbers don’t outweigh the advantage that comes from being white.  Just wait and see.

                        Yeah well we used to not be a minority in our own damn places. How did that change? Is that also some part of ‘white genius’ to first burn down the house and then get serious??
I find mindless, unsubstantiated optimism insufferable.

                            In regards to unsubstantiated optimism, there’s a reason I read the Breitbart Facebook comments section daily.  It reminds me of just how unprepared “our side” really is.

                    Gracious!No human life has mathematical certainty.Never mind demographics.There is this certainty; you must fight to survive. if you are weak you will be eliminated sooner or later as will your offspring.  This is the way it should be per Nature.  This is Nature: the weak are culled from the pool.  No matter their “intelligence.”No matter how many “children you have” which is of course woman’s victory not a man’s.TBH what I read in neorxn makes me hesitant to breed with a white woman.  I value strength and bravery over “Intelligence.”   Somehow we ended up with a lot of weak males.   Smart beta cucks but weak on physical and moral courage.   As Z said we have peace and prosperity problems.  But maybe we have genetic weakness as well.   Maybe we need to look to fierce if dusky women to stir in some balls.   Tis certain we are presently and for some time weak and that sons won’t get balls from certain Fathers.The strong survive, the weak perish.  That is Nature’s Law.

Have you heard of statistics? Technically you re right, statistics is not mathematics. But that’s not what you meant.
Meat and potato time, in every generation born from 2010 and since, non-whites are in a majority in the US. That makes non-white majority a – I ll humor you –statisticalcertainty.
About breeding, no comments, suit yourself.

Wrong.
I’m actually not in favor of manifestos for our side, but what is the Black Pill manifesto?
Because the Black Pill manifesto (and script) seems to be affirming the Progressive manifesto but as “fellow doomed white people.”
Where are you Black Pillers going with this and why should we follow you?
I politely await the answer.

                                Okay, legit and good question I think. When I say that whites will be minority in the US in the future, I dont mean it in a black pill, ‘it’s hopeless, let’s just all give up’, sense. I just mean that it is something so crushingly probable that it should be assumed to be something that will happen. B/c denying that this is so seems increasingly like a delusion.Whether you are in the US or in Europe, there are undeniable demographic changes happening. And we must acknowledge them, b/c they are part of the reality we are going to live inside whether we like it or not. And then, under the restrictions imposed by reality, we can discuss how and what to do from here. Does that make sense?

                                    Thank you for the answer.My answer is we fight.That’s what we do.Because I already factored in the migrants.In 2015 most of those flooding over the border were military age males.They’re not here to vote.Or even get on welfare.Those aren’t refugees, they’re reinforcements.This was of course the height of the Democrats shoot cops to get out the black vote campaign drive.Their position now is openly more extreme on Open Borders – they all endorsed opening the borders and have added in free health care.Why?Because they don’t care about elections.  They know they won’t get elected by whites, possibly soon not by blacks, or anyone born here with a stake in the country.They also now know we won’t be disarmed, they don’t have the military or vets, they pretty much have burnt the bridges with the police.    They moved past voting 2014-2016.  They moved past honoring the vote the night Trump was elected.  They just attempted a failed coup (most coups flop).Far from not factoring in the migration I concluded years ago they have chosen war and genocide.   The migrants are to deliver both.That’s why I get on about the Black Pill, or the Pink Pill of cringe.   Not because I dispute the facts but because I dispute the despair.   I dispute the passive resignation to our doom.We fight.  That’s what we do.   That’s my pill.  They already chose for us.

            I’m no fan of Forrest.  And in fact almost am not here because of him.  But if they want to have “Nate Forrest Day” so be it–let the chips fall were they may.  He wasn’t much of a human, but a damn good cavalryman.  Had Lee had him, instead of that peacock, Stuart, at Gettysburg, Buford never would have been able to dictate the disposition of the fighting ground.

                Forrest may not have been “much of a human” as you say but he was a helluva man.   He came from nothing, was fearless, and could fight.   Trad America could use a trainload of NBF’s today.  Instead we have weakling cucks who just passed a law forcing the US military to accept transgenders.

                    No we’re not.
And on the black pill, et al…
Far from not factoring in the migration I concluded years ago they have chosen war and genocide. The migrants are to deliver both.
That’s why I get on about the Black Pill, or the Pink Pill of cringe. Not because I dispute the facts but because I dispute the despair. I dispute the passive resignation to our doom.

                NBF founded the KKK, this is the limit of Prog knowledge about him. But NBF founded it as a fraternity and left the group before it became a violent racial militia. Hes just another Confederate war hero, the kind of figure that every nation needs. The only reason Tennessee made it an official holiday is to trigger the Progs.

        I don’t think the Left is so much at war with nature as with the understanding and recognition of it – that is, with science. A good example would be the fact that there is now essentially no objective, skeptical study of homosexuality in the Western world. Around 1970 the psychological profession (which admittedly always followed dubiously unscientific methods, see Freud, Jung, etc…) abandoned the idea that there could be *anything* bad about it. Today the subject is dominated by the pseudo-sciences of “queer theory” and “gender studies” taught/preached as a new religion in universities all over.Civilization itself is a “war on nature” to some extent. Monogamy, for example, is almost certainly not natural but seems to be the foundation of a stable advanced technological society. The modern Left has successfully freed women from dependence on a man through a convoluted system of make-work jobs in corporations and government, ridiculously prolonged “education”, and for the less capable and intelligent ones, outright welfare. This was all supposed to lead to a wonderful world of equality where men and women met and married on equal terms and divided up chores and paid work 50/50. The reality is that it simply let women return to their most essential nature. The last time anyone saw this as a mainstream lifestyle though, was 10,000 years ago. The modern career girl is just a neolithic ur-mutter ignoring 80% of the men and spending her fertile years riding as much alpha dick as possible which the workplace of course makes available in droves. The problem is that you end up with the average man unable to find a stable relationship and thus saving, productive work, domestic life and delayed gratification go away. You get the modern pot-smoking porn addled herbivore kid who doesn’t care about the future, his country, or much of anything else. Since the women are “employed” doing mostly useless make-work you eventually have a society without skilled workers, scientists, or in the end-game, even cops and soldiers. This is all perfectly “natural” though, it’s just a reversion to the neolithic norm. It’s not compatible with maintaining our kind of society though.

        Ironically, the idea that “reality always wins therefore my realistic views will win” was much more consoling when I was a CivNat libertarian.  Tea Party Me believed in the  BoomerCon view of “Manifested Destiny” best expressed by the awful patriotard pandering of Trump’s 7/4 speech – Eternal Ascendent Exceptional America.Red-pilling includes acceptance of the idea that we can lose, our race/culture could be effectively wiped out ala Amerindians.  It also includes the idea that we’re part of an ecosystem of races/cultures, all rising or falling according to circumstances (of which evolution and history are the most determinative).  It requires that we let go of end-times destiny (arcs of history, apocalpse, sudden social collapse, Singularity, etc) while figuring out how to hang on to the spiritual, transcendent and ideal in a way that doesn’t grossly warp our view of reality.  Accepting nature means accepting responsibility to fight for our own survival rather than wishing for it, and letting go of the blinders that stand in the way of that process.

            Well said.  Not long ago got into a mini-debate with a lefty who was decrying the treatment of native Americans.  My comeback was “why we they not morere welcoming of the rich diversity and enrichment the European settlers, who were mostly refugees from oppression, brought?  Sounds like the Indians were cultural bigots to me”.  Poor thing did not know how to counter that.

                    But the men didn’t stand up.   The women did- and moved the Ball considerably before the Left pincer of Federal IRS and the Right Flank sellout collapsed them.   That’s the nature of dissident politics BTW.
Dalrock has no courage so he has no real convictions.We can get wailing and bitching from the women too.  My main point is where were the men?

        The great problem of our time is that the Left has finally figured out how to induce mass moral paralysis in its victims: this time the invaders are unarmed, and they use their women and children as human shields and as biological weapons.  No normal person wants to shoot a bunch of begging, pleading, wheedling, unarmed paupers.  The Left is counting on this, they are using your very decency against you.  It is, one must admit, a very potent weapon.  Nobody has yet figured out a morally permissible way to counter it.Think of it.  The Nazis, the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Red Army with its /nuclear arsenal/, not one of them could overcome American might and American resolve.  But America will now be successfully invaded and destroyed by an endless swarm of greasy paupers who show up with their sniffling children, and offer to mow the lawn and wash the dishes.As the old French military saying goes: C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre.

            Well we can be innocuous too.Meanwhile we organize.Practical Organizing.Our only flaw on the Right is organization.  But how to do safely?   By keeping it light.Groups can quite organize along the lines of food banks, community self help and other innocuous matters.  The key point is organization.   Organizing builds skills.Organizing builds organizations.  Organization is our potential fatal flaw.  The Left is very organized.  That’s the key to the Lefts success.Money, numbers are off far less importance then organization.Organizing events that involve traveling, logistics, etc is the key deficiency we are trying to solve.Any explicit manifesto or statement of values or probably any politics at all is unnecessary, unwise and a security risk.  Any amateur never mind professional will quite master the shibboleths some are foolishly using as a screen.   B_tch please.  Oaths?Useless.  Threats?  If you were in a line of work where that was credible instead of counterproductive you wouldn’t be here.Stay off social media.B-Please.  Use secure chat.WhatsApp is fine.Don’t deceive innocents.They’ll be angry – and owe you no loyalty.The Harder Stuff.   Avoid anything illegal.   Including discussions; that’s called Conspiracy and you go to Jail achieving nothing.Protests;  fine.   Good for organizing.  Don’t mix it with innocuous, non- threatening groups.  Don’t cross the streams.  That’s Bad.Harder stuff training.PT you do yourself.   Weapons?  Join the local gun club.   Paint ball.Guns teach you the weapon.Paintball teaches tactics.8 men is enough (squad).&gt;Squads build armies not armies build squads.At the local gun club do not discuss romantic notions of government beyond the Constitution.  It doesn’t matter what you think or theorize about how the Constitution failed** the sworn, trained soldiers and cops there who swore sacred oaths to it will not be impressed by the Right Wing version of Jon Stewart mocking their sacrifice.**We’re failing and far beyond mere politics.Shut up and listen.  Ask polite technical questions.  Trust is earned slow.  Don’t be chatty.Do not expect vets or cops to trust or even talk to strangers.Nor rednecks.  Maybe a little after awhile. Slowly.Prospects:  sound out slowly, do not deceive.  Do not ask too much.  In fact ask little. See if a little is given.Shun drug users, people who wear camo unless hunting, or anyone with a beef they talk about- especially anyone who has a beef with the cops.  THAT’S THE SNITCH.  If he isn’t already he will be upon arrest.  His next arrest I mean, because people don’t hate cops over tickets or the 2d Amendment.   They hate cops cuz….the cops are a threat to the drugs.  Or the cops busted them in real crime.   His next arrest is the maximum limit of his loyalty or discretion.  There will be another arrest, it’s what he does.The police as enemy is utterly fatal.  They are not or we would know, they are not or leftists wouldn’t be shooting them.  Make them one and it’s over- because they do see you.They’ll know.  But what do they act on or report?  We’d know if they were leftists.   All you can ask of them is benign neutrality – see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil;  and magic will happen – you’ll be invisible.Really.   But you must respect them in return, and reciprocate.Be careful.  Listen to instincts.If it feels off then back off.Once someone wise told me the best man for covert ops was a coward.  He won’t get caught or make drama or mess.  Drama or mess draws attention.  Attention brings detection.   Detection is Doom.To summarize;  organization above all is what we lack, and after that logistics – the organization of supply and transport – these are what we lack.  Not men, not guns, not even will.Organize, keep anything public innocuous, don’t break the law or even discuss it.Organize, Train and wait.

        “Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains”
My purely anecdotal observation is that man is born naked, squalling and helpless. To the extent he acquires any freedom at all, it’s through being socialized into a society interested in defending those kinds of things.

        Great post.  As a Christian, I completely agree with your premise but would state it slightly differently – radical (i.e. fallen) man is at war with God and His order.  But leaving aside the tenets of Christianity, the natural law worldview necessitates something transcendent, a “Divine Providence” that established objective truth, laws of logic, and human rationality.  These are metaphysical, non-material concepts that don’t biologically evolve; science can’t begin to explain them because science RESTS on them.  Our Founders, whether Christian or deist, grasped this, along with the paradox that in order for imperfect man to be free he must be bound by a transcendent moral (or natural) law.  Thus the starkly differing results between the American vs French revolutions.The big problem for the Left is that when they war with God (or Nature), by necessity they’re also at war with truth, logic, and rationality.  And moral codes?  Concepts of honor, civility, decency?  The nation-state, community, family?  Social constructs to be tossed on the rubbish heap.  Welcome to the brave Left world, where today 2+2=5 … tomorrow, who knows?  But nutty philosophies aren’t benign – they lead to barbarism, as we’re seeing throughout the West.  The Left may have their coalitions of convenience (which are constantly unravelling, e.g AOC vs Pelosi), but they’re all essentially self-proclaimed gods. They live a life of perpetual delusion … this is the natural, consequential curse of warring against God; we need to understand that these people are no longer rational beings.  And whenever the demigods get power – every and any time in history – they deliver slaughter, destruction, misery.

        The rejection of nature by the left is less a reasoned position and much more of a rationalized excuse for their aggression and usurpation of the West. Reason is a rare commodity, rationalization is the standard in human affairs.  There is a very good evolutionary reason for this: group cohesion and the ability to define in-group vs out-group needs and interests.Characterizing the evolved natural order of the West as not bio-historical but as social-constructivist exploitation in the service of the worst of humanity (cis white males)…gives moral ascendancy to an enemy who cannot simple march in and conquer what they envy.“The Shadow of Christianity ” has given them that rationalization.Reason didn’t get us into this and it won’t get us out of it.“You cannot come in, because we live here and we say so”… is all the rationalization we need.

        Nuts and bolts matter. Waves of illegals are still streaming here despite the rhetoric of the Trump Administration, and Democrats are highly incentivized to cheat in the 2020 election in order to reclaim the Supreme Court. It is likely that literally millions of illegals will vote in this upcoming election. Whining won’t make it better, and we’re not going to talk our way out of the coming crisis.

                In the days when process might have still mattered, a based POTUS should have packed the court with 5 nominees, forcing a Constitutional crisis that would have in turn forced a debate on the scope of judicial review and Congress’ failure to use jurisdiction stripping authority to de-fang Justice Marshall’s hellspawn.  Given that our last chance to do soemething like that was the HW administration, it’s a moot point for weekend musing now.  It’s true that Congress’ abdication of its responsibilities in return for shekels is the root cause of our present Constitional collapse, but as Z has discussed before, the cracks in our system were foundational and most of the fatal damage was done in the Second Founding.  All the Constitutional witchery we could have deployed couldn’t give a democratic Empire the kind of leadership who wouldn’t eventually sell the country by the pound.

We’ve lost that war.  Follow Law 22: Transform Weakness into Power.  (This is what Z calls “sand in the gears).-So called “prepping” is nonsense charlatans sell to part Boomers from their Social Security checks.  There will be no TEOWAKI.-Stay flexible.

                Or we could fight.Victory would allow rapid demographic change in our favor.You may not be ready.I’m a vet.  You’re never ready.  Not at first.Migration;Those aren’t voters, welfare recipients from Mexico.They’re military age males, 80% in 2015.Those aren’t refugees, they’re reinforcements.The Dems know they’re finished with elections.  So they’ve dispensed with them.   AoCortez isn’t Lenin but she has a sound plan.The open borders signaling from the debate isn’t to win primary votes- its giving the bureaucracy their orders along with the NGOs, teachers, churches and the rest.They’re betting on war and genocide, and the migrants are to deliver both.  The migrants who think otherwise will find their choice has been made for them.  Once over the border they burnt their boats.  Perhaps in a way AoCortes is a shade of her namesake.I don’t dispute black pill facts.   I do dispute the resigned despair.We know what they’re doing.   What are we going to do?  Unlike AoCortes we have no country to flee to.We really have two choices:Fight.Lay down and die.Flee?Where? 🤣🤣

            Practical Organizing.Our only flaw on the Right is organization.  But how to do safely?   By keeping it light.Groups can quite organize along the lines of food banks, community self help and other innocuous matters.  The key point is organization.   Organizing builds skills.Organizing builds organizations.  Organization is our potential fatal flaw.  The Left is very organized.  That’s the key to the Lefts success.Money, numbers are off far less importance then organization.Organizing events that involve traveling, logistics, etc is the key deficiency we are trying to solve.Any explicit manifesto or statement of values or probably any politics at all is unnecessary, unwise and a security risk.  Any amateur never mind professional will quite master the shibboleths some are foolishly using as a screen.   B_tch please.  Oaths?Useless.  Threats?  If you were in a line of work where that was credible instead of counterproductive you wouldn’t be here.Stay off social media.B-Please.  Use secure chat.WhatsApp is fine.Don’t deceive innocents.They’ll be angry – and owe you no loyalty.The Harder Stuff.   Avoid anything illegal.   Including discussions; that’s called Conspiracy and you go to Jail achieving nothing.Protests;  fine.   Good for organizing.  Don’t mix it with innocuous, non- threatening groups.  Don’t cross the streams.  That’s Bad.Harder stuff training.PT you do yourself.   Weapons?  Join the local gun club.   Paint ball.Guns teach you the weapon.Paintball teaches tactics.8 men is enough (squad).&gt;Squads build armies not armies build squads.At the local gun club do not discuss romantic notions of government beyond the Constitution.  It doesn’t matter what you think or theorize about how the Constitution failed** the sworn, trained soldiers and cops there who swore sacred oaths to it will not be impressed by the Right Wing version of Jon Stewart mocking their sacrifice.**We’re failing and far beyond mere politics.Shut up and listen.  Ask polite technical questions.  Trust is earned slow.  Don’t be chatty.Do not expect vets or cops to trust or even talk to strangers.Nor rednecks.  Maybe a little after awhile. Slowly.Prospects:  sound out slowly, do not deceive.  Do not ask too much.  In fact ask little. See if a little is given.Shun drug users, people who wear camo unless hunting, or anyone with a beef they talk about- especially anyone who has a beef with the cops.  THAT’S THE SNITCH.  If he isn’t already he will be upon arrest.  His next arrest I mean, because people don’t hate cops over tickets or the 2d Amendment.   They hate cops cuz….the cops are a threat to the drugs.  Or the cops busted them in real crime.   His next arrest is the maximum limit of his loyalty or discretion.  There will be another arrest, it’s what he does.The police as enemy is utterly fatal.  They are not or we would know, they are not or leftists wouldn’t be shooting them.  Make them one and it’s over- because they do see you.They’ll know.  But what do they act on or report?  We’d know if they were leftists.   All you can ask of them is benign neutrality – see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil;  and magic will happen – you’ll be invisible.Really.   But you must respect them in return, and reciprocate.Be careful.  Listen to instincts.If it feels off then back off.Once someone wise told me the best man for covert ops was a coward.  He won’t get caught or make drama or mess.  Drama or mess draws attention.  Attention brings detection.   Detection is Doom.To summarize;  organization above all is what we lack, and after that logistics – the organization of supply and transport – these are what we lack.  Not men, not guns, not even will.Organize, keep anything public innocuous, don’t break the law or even discuss it.Organize, Train and wait.

        Reality may win over the long term. But when you have a para-military police force, academia and a judicial system on your side to dictate what is and what isn’t.  Reality can go take a hike for a long time.Lysenko knew it and do modern Lefties. This is why we have the Gender Unicorn teaching our kids about how fluid sex is, etc.Or go on a public venue and state there are only two sexes and dressing differently does  not change it. and see what happens.  You won’t get arrested(yet) but you will get doxed and most likely lose your job when the SJW’s figure our who you are.Reality will continue getting kicked around as long as the police and welfare state exists.

                MemeWarVet said: “All the more reason to support Universal Basic Income…quicker we crash the plane the better.” That’s the  “Cloward–Piven strategy.”  It was cooked up by two commie professors teaching at Columbia University school of social work in 1966.

                    So what?  Leverage the enemy’s tools against him.

Right now, all the spots on the lifeboats are being given to blacks and browns.  I’m of the opinion that, if we all get cast into the water at once, Team White will be the only ones smart enough to figure out how to swim.
We stay on the Titanic, we watch Paco and Shoqueesha sail away to safety.

        Yeah, like the excellent comment of “Exile” above but put more bluntly, it’s very clear that one element of nature in human life isviolence.
I think there is some sort of delusion onourpart that once you’ve done the violence bit, and set up a deliberative, procedural political system, that it will run forever, like a perpetual-notion machine, and violence will never be needed again.
Nature suggests that this is a delusion. Sometimes you’ve got to, ah,weed the garden. Or else the weeds crowd out the flowers.

            Jefferson, for all his flaws, had the water the tree part right.  Like economics needs a periodic debt jubilee, politics needs to circulate the elites (h/t Pareto).  Burnham’s “Machiavellians” covers Pareto’s thought on this and also other realthinkers, including one (Mosca, IIRC) who expressly said that the threat of violence is a necessary corrective to political corruption and decadence.  Essentially, the theory was that Karl Roves and Sheldon Adelsons wouldn’t exist in a populace which knew the rope and pitchfork have valid roles in maintaining a just and happy society.

        I respectfully disagree. I’d say that liberalism or progressives or the woke or whatever you want to call them are far more in tune with nature than we are: they are the footsoldiers of the new dynasties.Just as Communism just made a pseudo-scientific aristocracy and its own (worse) Ivan the Terrible in Stalin, or Mao, or Pol Pot, our progressive/woke stack is basically nothing more than dynasty after dynasty, mostly allied with weird foreigners with weirdo foreign obsessions (like Saikat Chakrabarti’s weirdo foreign obsession with weirdo “Nazis for Brown People” Chandra Bose).The Soviets lasted as long as they did because they had a ruling class that could pay for people to kill on their behalf, and allow selected members of the killers (such as Putin) to move up into the ranks. When they ran out of money to pay killers they ran out of chances. The Chinese have not made that mistake. Indeed New Yellow Emperor Xi and his family seem firmly established.The dissident right has yet to fully grasp this, and understand that the long, long winning streak is nothing more than spoils politics: the budding New Class dynasties throw off various tidbits to various groups which then aggressively defend their “iron rice bowls” or more accurately their pseudo feudalistic privileges. Just as students in Universities in Medieval times were considered “clergy” and thus able to break laws in University towns with impunity, sometimes even boycotting towns when the freedom of students to riot, steal, etc. was limited by outraged townspeople (they would pick up and move elsewhere) so too do the LGBTQWERTY groups, people of color, various weirdos etc. all get privileges granted by the semi hereditary groups in the military, NGOs, woke corporate capital*, and so on. And show up to fight to preserve said privileges. Such as at least two free murders if the victims are White and the perp Black (OJ Simpson).*That weirdo foreigners like Indra Nooyi (CEO of Pepsi), that weirdo Turk (CEO of Coke), weirdo CEO of Microsoft (another upper caste thinks his poop does not reek Indian), Google/Alphabet, foreign gay Tim Cook of Apple, run some of the most important US corporations is a flashing red flag that we are seeing neo feudal dynasties as the nation state falls apart.If the Left broadly was incompetent, stupid and at war with human nature it would have failed spectacularly like a Jim Jones Kool-Aide festival. For the most part, that did not happen — instead they took over the entire West.The mistake is listening to their drivel, instead of watching their actions. In all instances they combine the worst of Anglo Adventurism (“I could be a King of the Foreigners instead of Joe Average at home” : see Dances with Wolves, Little Big Man, Avatar, etc). And the ruthless dynastic combinations of the Hapsburgs and Bourbons. Marriage for them is a loveless affair of combining joint assets and spawning out privileged heirs of Hamptons cottages and Summer as a verb not a season. They often intermarry or ally themselves with foreign elite weirdos: Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, etc. Mayor Pete Buttgig is a golden example of the corrupt nature of their dynasties.That women love love love dynasties and see themselves as Game of Thrones Danishcookie Teagarden ruling a bunch of Black dudes in some unstoppable Army with a dragon ought to be an indication that dynasties and hereditary rulers benefit (hot women or those that figure with a bit more beauty regimen they too can land at least part of a hereditary big shot) the fairer sex and give ordinary men the short end of the stick.The fact that the Left offers a hereditary dynasty and the Right offers a flat, less hierarchical mostly meritocracy is the REASON the Left always wins. The way to beat that is not more of the same offer of meritocracy, but our own budding dynasty.Of course, a prerequisite is that the current rulers lose a major war, badly. It would show they can be beaten (because they were) and losers have to hand over privileges to the foreign winners which shows their patronage powers on the wane.Our thing ought to be: Joe Average you can be the ruler not the slave of: various hot women, icky weird foreigners have to grovel to you not the other way around, he gets feudal privileges and immunity from laws not foreigners and various weirdo sex groups and people of color.No one will fight and die to be average and treated fairly. To be King? That’s another matter. And that’s human nature.

            That’s pretty good, Whiskey. I like the medieval and dynasty connection. The modernists are more Dionysian, more into the irrational which is certainly a big part of Nature. That said, they make unnatural, abstract architecture. So, there’s a kind of disconnect there.

            The problem is democracy itself, which breeds its own dynasties (See Kennedys, Bush family, various representatives who are the sons or daughters of previous ones).  The dynasties that democracy breeds are feeble ones, just as feeble as Louis XVI, maybe more media savvy and better liars.  Putin is actually the happy medium, a lower middle class (by Russian standards) kid from the St. Petersburg projects who rose to greatness, all the way through the ranks.  Those are the leaders you have to take notice of.  A mix of brutality, realism, and craftiness.  In any altercation, diplomatic or otherwise that we have with Putin, my money is on Putin every single time to find some upper hand.  Not any of our dynasties, and not Orange fuck face who was born on home plate with his idiot daughter and son in law.  Yes, you could say Hitler and Napoleon were the same, and they did make catastrophic errors (strangely involving Russia).  The ones who jump fences from the perimeter of society to the core are the ones you look at.  Rare talents, some of them purely sociopathic, but talented nonetheless.  When you compare them to that whore Kamala Harris?  But-gag?  Whoever?  Like a hot knife through butter.  Should our country ever turn a corner and once again be on the upswing, it will be done by a brutal, smart upstart from the perimeter (NOT DC metro area).

            Good comment, thanks. Related to this, in my view, is the perennial attraction of socialism. I agree with you that right-wing societies tend to be flatter and more meritocratic which is fine if you believe yourself to be among the meritorious. But not everyone does. In fact, it is probably only a minority that do. If you lack merit (or perceive yourself as lacking merit) then that is a decidedly grim prospect because you’re likely to spend your whole life rattling around at the bottom end of the pecking order. Who votes for that?Nor is there any shortage of such people. In fact, there are tens of millions of them and socialism is always going to be attractive to them because it offers them the prospect of enjoying a higher status in society than they otherwise would have. For many people, money plundered is twice as sweet as money earned.I have many FB friends (Chamber of Commerce types, it must be said) who agonise over the seemingly inexplicable attraction of left-wings ideas to successive generations when it has been proved time and again that socialism leads to stagnation at best and tyranny and poverty at worst. So they keep churning out articles and memes aimed at convincing everyone that “socialism doesn’t work”.What they miss is the acute human desire for higher status. If you happen to be someone for whom a rugged, free-market economy means a lifetime of futile struggle and a pauper’s grave, then socialism not only works but it works better than anything else.What definitely doesn’t work is going around saying that socialism doesn’t work. That’s what doesn’t work.

                Many people who love socialism have poor genes and are using hired guns, through the electoral process, to compensate for that by stealing more resources for them.  It’s reverse darwinism…for a time, but when the public purse is used up the tide comes back in and corrects the equilibrium.

            I dont think you re right but it’s a good comment and hard to put my finger on why I disagree. I believe leftie is less hierarchical than we are. They are fighting for a decadent ‘screw, party and be happy.’ We want a  more orderly society where good things happen to people earn them. And that is the part they hate, that you must earn your wins.

        “Freedom” is an interesting word.  The radicals always cry freedom as their motivating factor.  Even the Soviet Union was about “liberation” of the workers.  But when you sift through those words you get the real reason, coined by TS Elliot a hundred hears ago.–“They constantly try to escape from the darkness outside and within by dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.  But the man that is shall shadow the man that pretends to be.”The French Revolution is fascinating.  They no only overthrew the king, they re-drew France into perfectly square precincts, they re-named and re-enumerated the months days and weeks to 10.  They loved the number 10 because it was round and orderly.  They put the remaining clergy on the government payroll, and an overtaken Catholic church in France began to worship the state and the revolution.  It goes on and on, and in so many of those things, we see things today that rhyme.  Right down to the printing of Assignats (govt. bonds) to keep the show going, ending in spectacular currency devaluation.  They dreamt and tried to create a perfect machine that takes away the need to sacrifice for each other, and when they did that, in a twist of irony, it ended in human sacrifice of each other.  It’s been done so many places, China, Russia, Cambodia, etc.  And the most strident members are upper middle class book worms who do something in the public sector, govt., universities, etc. and the college “educated” unemployed in coffee shops.

            Wikipedia, for the curious:
Kokutai (国体, “national body/structure of state”) is a concept in the Japanese language translatable as “system of government”, “sovereignty”, “national identity, essence and character”, “national polity; body politic; national entity; basis for the Emperor’s sovereignty; Japanese constitution”.
And a smack upside the head for all who use untranslated foreign terms.

                That’s the point of the untranslated foreign term, though — why DON’T we have a term for this?  “Kokutai” is “Japanese-ness.”  There once was a thing we could call “American-ness,” but it’s gone, killed off by the word “privilege.”  Any attempt to bring it back would, of course, be rayciss.  So we need a loan word.  (Re: “Greatest hits,” I have no idea what a “greatest hit” would be.  The stuff I write that I like, nobody else seems to; the stuff other people seem to like, I can’t figure out why).

                        I have commented on this before. Some time in the 1990s the word “queer” went from being a below-the-belt insult to a badge of honour. Now we have LGBTQ proudly emblazoned on the battle flags of the Globohomo army.

                    We /do/ have a word for this –several, in fact:  one is “commonwealth,” and another is “republic” (literally res publica, meaning “the public, viz. shared, common, affairs or goods or stuff).  Another such word is “patria”, the fatherland — literally “having to do with fathers”, viz the land (which is tangible, and has a fixed, defined reality) of our fathers, viz the men who were OUR fathers, not just anybody’s father.We’ve allowed ourselves to become so deracinated that we no longer recognize the basic meanings of very common words in our own language.  And it was Somebody, meaning not ourselves, who slowly and patiently eroded our sense of specificity, and replaced it with poisonous universalism.  Hint: the idea of the “melting pot” is not actually an American idea, guess Whose idea it was…  and that stupid sentimental poem that changed the Statue of “Liberty” into the Statue of Immigration, and basically invited the whole planet here — on whose authority?  Who wrote that nonsense?  Oh, right.  Every. Single. Time.

                    If I am out on the streets and shoot down an Antifah member who just bashed me across the head with a baseball bat – it’s highly likely my ass is going to jail.But if that Antifah member doxes me and shows up with a few of his friends at my house and breaks in and threatens my wife and infant child with weapons – even here in MA I do stand of chance of getting away with shooting them down.In fact most self defense experts will tell you : If you’re going to shoot in self defense – shoot to kill.So explain to me again how progs “taking their revenge upon us” – is necessarily a bad thing?

                        Antifa has an army of (((lawyers))) behind them.  They may be degenerate drug addicts, but they have training and organization.
They aren’t going to break into your house so you can shoot them.  They will hit it with multiple Molotov cocktails while you sleep, and shoot you if you’re fortunate enough to wake up and flee.  And the befuddled keystone kops will mysteriously find no actionable evidence.

                            Look – if that’s where you think this is going – you need to stop with the “they’re all out to get us” bullshit and realize that the violence IS going to go both ways.  I’m not a big cop defender – but the ones I do know – and I’ve talked with a few – would beat down Antifah clowns with a smile on their face.  And (again) – that is out here in MA.If the cops are not going after Antifah – it’s because the the street cops are being told by the  higher ups to stand down.  And I would bet that they’re not happy about it.  Rank and file and “management” in police circles are two very different things.  That gets made very clear out here when you look at gun laws.  The local police captains are often very anti gun – especially when it comes to handing out permits to civilians.  But there is quite a few  officers who patrol the streets every day who are enthusiastic gun owners.If it really comes to what you’re describing – and a few Antifah members burn up in front of my house while they’re throwing Molotov cocktails at it – and also get shot while they’re shooting at me – I am pretty sure the rank and file – who are the ones tasked with “investigating” what happened – will be more than willing to write it off as Antifah being Antifah.Same way they are in the inner cities when blacks shoot each other.  Maybe you need to go look at the crime statistics for solved murders.  The nightly news headlines the EASY cases.  The one where some rich white guy killed his wife.  Those ones get solved because their high profile, they happen in rich towns where the detectives don’t have anything to do anyway – so there’s time to spend solving them.If Antifah starts going apeshit – the rate of those murders that will get “solved” will be more like Chicago:https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/21/chicago-police-homicide-clearance-rate-killing-murder-shooting/1368099002/Chicago police solved fewer than one in six homicides in the first half of 2018You know why they don’t solve them?  Yes – partially because they’re understaffed,  but there’s also a very high ” I simply don’t give a fuck” component at work here.  The fact of the matter is that the average cop simply isn’t going to go above and beyond to solve a street murder in Chicago.The same principle will apply if and when Antifah starts going off their leash.

        a nation has the right to decide who enters their lands.
Much as the current Pope (and many of the Bishops) disagree with that, the Church’s catechism says exactly that, too.  No surprise, as that’s Natural Law.

        Z Man said: “This long super-cycle, which began with the Enlightenment and will conclude at some as yet undetermined point in the future, is a long war on nature. Each generation of radicals conjures a new world and new war on biological reality. Rousseau said, “The world of reality has its limits; the world of imagination is boundless.” This is the radical’s creed, but nature has a creed of her own. That is, reality is that thing that does not go away when you stop believing in it.” Here’s an artical from the American Renaissance website called “The Rise of Political Correctness” that has some great things to say about this subject.https://www.amren.com/news/2017/01/rise-political-correctness/From the old hippy days until now, I’ve watched the world desend deeper and deeper into madness with no end in sight. I Watched the Concervitives get the evangelical churches involved in politics which was a terrible mistake. Because it left the church wide open for infiltration and subversion by the progressives. The Concervitives, (being who they are) , never had a chance against the radical left.  Here’s an artical by Robert L. Dabney , a southern preacher in the 18 hundreds on “Political Compromise and  Conservatives.”https://youngpuritan.wordpress.com/2010/04/09/dabney-on-political-compromise-and-conservatives/It’s been a long road to the bottom.

        Z Man said: “…so the radicals have been forced to take a different tact. Instead of arguing that their cause is a return to man’s natural condition, they now argue that nature is imaginary, an optical illusion, socially constructed by the people benefiting from the current order. Nature is now the chains of man.” Unfortunately for the PC freakshow we still don’t live in the tightly controlable world there striving for. Even in the Soviet Union there were lots of people that weren’t completely zombified. Look at Alexander Solzhenitsyn. For those white dissidents who have the resources and expertise, there must be loads of ways to screw with the leftist beast without ever getting there hands dirty. Remember that quote I posted from rules for radicals the other day?  Rule #5. “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” “There is no defense.”  “It’s irrational.”  “It’s infuriating.”  “It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.”  An unrelenting torrent of ridicule from every possible angle would be a good place to start. Here’s a website called ” Right Wing News ” with a few suggestion.https://rightwingnews.com/john-hawkins/12-ways-to-use-saul-alinskys-rules-for-radicals-against-liberals/I think James O’Keefe at Project Veritas has done some good things in the past. I would to see a lot more of that. Try to find ways to pry apart the rainbow horde. Stir up a little hate and strife between the beautiful people. Blue sky thinking, that’s the key.

Is this true? You cannot trust the British press. If it is so, then has he just broken some taboo?

        Z: “The answer to foreigners demanding access to your land does not have to be any more than, “You cannot come in, because we live here and we say so.”fuckin’ a.   Back when the border “caravan” was a developing news story, I overheard some guy virtue boasting about “why SHOULDN’T they be allowed to come here!?”  Like it was some philosophical question that required a rational answer.  I boasted back, “because we don’t WANT them here!”  He didn’t respond but just stared at me dumbfounded.  Like he hadn’t heard such a thing since childhood and had forgotten that such a “selfish” way of thinking still exists.   It was all instinct.  I guess his Universal Benevolence! outburst lost to my Will of the People! outburst.  heh.  (Of course, given demo changes, in about 3 years the Will of the People argument is gonna be used against us.)

            It’s funny how dudes on our side have their pet era or person that denotes the *real* start of things going to hell.  My pet catalyst is Rousseau, as he unleashed both the drama queens and the drama queens who weep for the drama queens.  (Pretty much everyone now except us.) The further you reach back for your pet watershed moment, the more utopian you are.  If you think it all started going to hell with freakin Wycliffe or Plato, you’re just butthurt about mankind in general.

        The Thousand Deaths are The Thousand Degradations.Cowards die a thousand deaths, the brave man dies but once.But cowardice is not a path to survival.  Public Degradations are the case being made to our very natures, our biology that we deserve extinction.What the poet meant was not 1000 deaths but 1000 Degradations.    Death you do not believe in nor will you until the light fades in your eyes.We’re well over 950 on the 1000 degradations.  By the way… but back to death.  You do not really believe in Death.But you can believe in Degradations.   You are white.You’ve been getting publicly degraded by Officialdom and the Official Religion your entire lives.   What you fail to accept is that yes they mean your extinction.   Your Intellect knows this but your Heart does not accept.What you failed to grasp even in mind it seems is that the Degradations were also a fitness test for your survival, and in a way an offer of redemption.   Had you shown Heart and Fought respect would have followed from most.   Respect is safety, contempt is constant primal danger.   Our biology commands us – ultimately the contemptible cannot be endured.Most Respect Heart but not all.   Some who influence but do not lead the Diversity Wolfpack against you  mean our genocide.   Influence, do not lead.  They have money, more importantly they are the traitors opening our gates.   A role some of (((them))) sanctify in their Holy Books- and call Righteous in the Old Testament.   Some.   As they endured endless Degradations to survive they return the favor.   As they rediscovered genocide with Communism they both commit Purim against us and enjoy degrading us to a knub on the way to our extinction.  Sexual degradation being a Tribal Custom.(The reverse is true with the Arabs; they are very, very upright in public to the point of Honor Killings-but wild behind closed doors.  The point of this aside is both are obsessed with sex.).Purim was Pre-Emptive Genocide.   Holy and a Holiday.When I say pre-emptive genocide is committing Purim that’s what I mean.We know this same conversation we’re having happened in Germany in the 1920s.   We know Stalin’s solution.   We know the Roman’s solution to the question especially after Cyprus.   Our closest historical analogue for this question is Rome’s 1st Century.    I suspect the same conversation happened in Persia just before Purim.   Purim is what’s intended for us.Now lets also understand that is very few of very few; but they’re the leaders or at least representing their Tribe.But Auto-Genocidal Puritans are in charge of ours.   The withered decency of sane Anglo Elites like Prescott Bush or even Kerry or Gore has long since given way.    It doesn’t matter why although sensing their own decadence and weakness must factor in.  They hate Sarah Palin, the Deplorables and the white working class far more than diversity does.  We’re their natural replacements when they fall.   The Hofjuden are just being themselves and either neither instinctively aggressive nor would they be entertaining Purim or The Great Replacement *except that we are so contemptible*.Lets understand Diversity’s aggressions against us – it’s Human Nature winning out over whatever decent restraints they have.   That’s not racial – it’s common human biology.    Not pigment, not impulse control, not lower IQ.Attempting to repress contempt for cowardice is repressing human nature – you may banish nature for a time but nature returns.We asked the impossible.  We asked our fellow man to respect the coward, the degraded, the contemptible.That is too much.   Because instinctively all humans know the weak drag you to your Doom.  Its our common biology.Now as to strife or war- we’ll see.   But the notion that one can from being spineless stand erect as a warrior in a moment or a day is fantasy.Start standing up for yourselves now, it vastly increases your chances of survival immediately and long term.  Even your “genetic enemies” will see use for you.At worst give you a man’s death.  At absolute worst.There was one more thing…You’re a threat to us too, fellow white man.  Far more than the Hofjude or the dusky hued.You make the case for our genocide to man’s very nature.You, weakling. You’re the real case to exterminate us.Now its ok to be scared if you don’t turn cur.  Practice being brave- its the path to fearless.Fearless is past brave.  Fearless loves danger like sex.The path begins with not showing weak.  Then be brave.That’s the case for our survival.Stop making the case for our genocide.  Stop accepting degradation or insult.Be strong.   We need you.Don’t show weak you embarrass us all.And endanger us all.

            Short version:  them making whites public cowards is making the case to our common human nature  that we must be destroyed.   And its working.
The 1000 deaths a coward dies are the 1000 degradations that justify to our very human natures the pressing urgency of the cowards removal.

        Libertarians are less so for saying nature is a social construct.  It seems they don’t consider nature at all, or natural law.  But write thousands of pages of scholarly articles where they explain their wished for utopia where everyone rides unicorns.Tom Woods might be emerging, but it is hard to tell.  He has said “Maybe the French might not adopt 2nd amendment ideas” (paraphrased).  What he has failed to say is that if 1 in 100 French wants to own a gun they should and would have shot the terrorists at the rock concert.  But at least it is a start to the understanding you need people who love liberty to have a libertarian society.

        As usual, you got it the wrong way around. Nationalism, as opposed to global government, IS more compatible with libertarianism. All human institutions are bureaucracies, the bigger they are, the more bureaucratic they are. Decentralized nationalism implies a future world of a 1,000 political entities. You don’t like one, you can go to another as long as they are willing to take you in. The possibility of exit exists. Global government is, well, global. There is no “exit” from it since it, by definition, would be everywhere.This is the reason why every libertarian worth their salt ought to support or at least be sympathetic with the current myriad movements towards national self-determination, even if many of those national entities end up not being “liberal” in and of themselves.In any case, the thousand state soverieghty world of the future you guys desire so much will have its trading cities, just like even the feudal, medieval Europe had its Venice and the like. The trading city-states will always be the abode of a cosmopolitan libertarianism.

        There is one reality of human nature that libertarians are well aware of and that all non-libertarians seem to ignore and that is the nature of bureaucracy. All human institutions are bureaucracies. The larger the institution, the more bureaucratic it is. It seems to be a law of human nature that bureaucracy, in general, is dysfunctional. The larger the human institution, the more dysfunctional it is. Libertarianism, with its emphasis on decentralization and individual autonomy recognizes this reality. All non-libertarian world-views seem in denial of this reality of human nature.As Murray Rothbard once said: If all humans are by nature good, then any kind of system ought to work. However, if humans are by nature bad (which seems to be the position of religions such as Christianity) it makes no sense to put one person or group of persons in charge of all others.Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It seems to me the best antidote to this is the negation of the very concept of monopoly-authoritarianism.

            I would think men would be in competition for access to beautiful women. And real estate is like a beautiful woman, she doesn’t sleep with poor, ugly men.

            Besides being wrong, Libertarian writing, posts, comments, just make me tired.  So tedious and boring.  Every sentence is a long wind-up to yet another boring sentence.
