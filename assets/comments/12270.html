            That’s giving him attention. He’s a little nobody mandarin. If it wasn’t for the loony left triggering at anything slightly to the right of them, nobody would know who he is.

                Does Shapiro ever do his debate shtick against someone on the right? It was a long time ago, but I recall watching Dinesh D’Souza debating Joe Sobran. We don’t see things like that anymore.

        This episode was so good, I listened to it twice.Shapiro reminded me of the whole Todd Akin fiasco, after which I could no longer believe Repubs were serious about winning and ruling.  For as long as anyone remembers,  we have been told to support the Republican candidate, and to fret over how insufficiently conservative a McCain or Romney was merely indicated you weren’t serious about winning. Half a loaf, art of the possible, etc.Along comes Todd Akin, and it was the turn of Responsible Republicans to back someone in order to win, despite his insufficiently politic views, and keep the Democrat out. The Repubs ran for the exits so fast it was like yelling fire in the crowded theater. All sham. Willing to lose habitually in order to avoid Prog shaming.The gay Stalinism of wedding cakes inspires another thought. The fags indeed want to use force legally to compel anyone they choose to work for them. One group, permitted to force another person to labor for them. If that’s not slavery it’s something damn close. That raises another question; if you can force that Christian baker to work for you, why do you have to pay him? After all, payments are negotiated in a normal transaction. But the baker doesn’t even get the normality of declining or accepting the work in the first place. The tyranny of the slaveholding sodomite.

        My favorite seasons are Fall and Spring but I also like the Winter. For some odd reason I find hot, humid weather and the ghost town effects of the summer months to be more despairing than the Winter

        George Coppard talked about the Spanish Flu overlap with gas casualties near the end of “With a Machine Gun to Cambrai.” The symptoms of surviving an “accessory” attack (phosgene, chlorine, etc.) are pretty similar (runny nose, sore throat) to Spanish flu. Our current immigration policy ensures there will be a similar pandemic in the future. New strains of TB are created every time someone starts treatment and then abandons it, and some of our friends to the south like to celebrate diversity by eating Armadillo meat, which can spread leprosy.

        I think the only thing Shapiro stands for is what whoever is paying him stands for. And if they aren’t telling him what they stand for, then he stands for nothing or whatever offends the least amount of people. He’s just a puppet, look at who pulls his strings.The other thing about mandarins like Shapiro is they’re what I like to call “box checkers”, the kind of kids who are Ivy League bound. When he was a kid, when he grew up he wanted to be a mandarin for the ruling class. I know that type and I can smell their odor. And oh, lookee there, graduated from Hahvahd Law School. Don’t give him attention or point out that only normies who don’t know any better are the only ones taking him seriously.Otherwise, he’s harmless. After all, he’s soft and weak and never really has had to face danger or make hard choices or take risks. Unlike, say, Trump.

            This. The above description also applies to lots of other members of Conservatism, Inc. George Will often seems to be just Ben Shapiro plus about forty years.

                Well, now you made me all curious as to Will’s mandarin cred. He dropped out of Hahvahd Law School but Hahvahd hired him as a teacher later (ha). But yes, this is a guy who has always played it safe, always collected a paycheck, always played ball. He’s not special, his name is Legion, especially around the cities and especially around, how does Z put it? The Imperial Capital?I dunno, in a more stable time (like the 80s) he probably made more sense. But with everything coming unglued and going to shit, nah, you shouldn’t listen to him anymore than you should listen to Shapiro.

                At least Will isn’t irritating to listen to. Little Benny OTOH:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_rQtGPBu98Only Mark ”fingernails on a chalkboard” Levin is worse.

            Born in Los Angeles, I look around and say, “Dude!  Like, what is all this WHITE sh*t?!”
When people say they like four seasons, I start reaching for blunt instruments.
So I saw some maniacs on snowmobiles in Wisconsin.Barbarians.  You Northmen are barbarians.Not an ounce of sense, not a trace of fear.

            Winter is my favorite season. Fall is next, followed by the thoroughly depressing arrival of spring. If I every leave the ghetto, my first choice would be northern New England.

        Hey! I listen to your Gab bonus segments. That alone, the mere fact that I, a Certified Curmudgeon, listen’s to your effusive flap jawing on Gab should, alone, be reason enough for you to continue those segments.

        regarding the first youtube segment on how the establishment now consider wrongthinking on the internet as a terror weapon, have you taken note of the recent media push on how children must be protected on the internet?They know that if we white dissidents can get our ideas into the heads of young white kids, we can win…they know that their propaganda war is best waged in the minds of impressionable youth…and now that all these white kids have cellphones, that gives us a way into their minds, which scares the establishment…The establishment is trying to scare parents into restricting internet freedom for children even more than it already is…look at the whole youtube child-oriented videos media hype…

                Don’t give your kids (&lt;16) a smart phone. The argument can be made that yes, kids do need a phone, I get that. A dumb &#x27;&#x27;burner&#x27;&#x27; phone, cheap (so if it&#x27;s lost/stolen/destroyed no biggie) simple, no personal information to be mined by faceberg, google, ect. Parents who give there kids iCrap or other such phones are doing it because they&#x27;re spineless or showoffs.The policy should be &#x27;&#x27;You want iCrap? Earn and save your money, then buy one yourself, otherwise it&#x27;s burner phones for you&#x27;&#x27;.

        I like Gab and keep a paid account, but my efforts to promote my own blog there resulted in virtually no traffic. A lot of bigger names who set up accounts there aren’t active either, I suspect for the same reason.

            Gab is in its infancy. I think they have 300K users at this point. My hunch is it will end up being something different from the last generation of social media.
Keep in mind that Gab does not include a referrer in links so it is really hard to know what traffic comes from them.
