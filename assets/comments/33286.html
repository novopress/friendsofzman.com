        Many Christians like myself believe we’re in end times, so none of what we are witnessing going on in the world is a surprise. European churches have been empty for decades. Some are now libraries, coffee shops, pubs, museums and some have already been converted to Mosques.While most Europeans claim to be a ‘Christians’ it’s mostly in contrast to being non-Christian. Christmas in Europe is predominantly secular and in Germany it’s about drinking Glühwein at the Christmas markets with friends more than celebrating Christmas as the time we reflect on the birth of Jesus Christ.Celebrating Christs birth is worthwhile as he came into this world to bear our sins and die in our place. Being with family and giving gifts is a wonderful tradition. But ultimately we should focus on what’s really important; repentance, accepting Christ as our Lord and savior and living our lives to please God until he calls us home.

                Not everybody is Christian here, plus mebbe some Christians didn’t like the ‘end times’ reference.  To be fair, that’s pretty hard yakka if you’re trying to raise a family, be stable and so forth.  Ok sure, no problem, I’ll just tell my kids it’s the end of the world.I understand that.  Unhappily, we have indeed reached the beginning pangs of the ‘tribulation’ — essentially an in-gathering of both Christians and evil.The acceleration of malice witnessed in America and elsewhere these decades past demonstrates a heightened number and quality of malevolent influences, both in organized order and in individuals.  Spiritual war gets downright frisky as planetary rights and ownership are at contention.

                Like Ray, I didn’t upvote because I don’t believe we’re in “end times.” I did, however, find much to agree with in the rest of the comment. Thus no downvote.
Still, end times or not, the worlddoesseem to be going to hell in a handbasket.

                    Agreed, sort of. Christians have been saying that since before the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, though. And “the youth” have always been Godless heathens, at least to large swaths of the elder generations.

            ‘Many Christians like myself believe we’re in end times, so none of what we are witnessing going on in the world is a surprise.’
Yes.  A significant portion of Scripture relates directly to our times.  We are forewarned in all things.

            Christianity specifically evolved as a way to deal with the existential facts of suffering, injustice, and meaningless, forgotten death. Christianity says that the Jewish tyrant Herod tried to kill Christ in the crib — and eventually the Jews, in collusion with the Romans, succeeded in humiliating and torturing him to death for exposing the hypocrisy and wickedness of the Jewish political and religious elites and exposing their moral self-righteousness as fraudulent.As hundreds, and then thousands, and then millions of people began to realize “They’d do that to me, too, and wouldn’t give it a second thought” Christianity began to spread.People in the wealthy, materialist, Jewish-controlled West have it too good to understand the true meaning of Christianity. They do not suffer and they are not tortured to death and mocked by soldiers in front of their fellow citizens for speaking truth to power. The modern welfare state buys their votes and their compliance by giving them government benefits, giving the false appearance that the government is benevolent.There will be a resurgence of Christianity in the future, but only when, like third-century Rome, the existing order becomes so thoroughly corrupt and debased that people simply “go Galt” and check out of the existing society and the existing power structure and create a parallel, subterranean society that rejects the materialist and Jewish values of ZOG and the GAE.

        A parallel evolution is happening with humans in general. We are going through a genetic bottleneck. Birthrates have plummeted so certain types of genes are disappearing. The genes of feminists, non-religious people and just people who aren’t into family are dying out – literally. The genes of those who want children are surviving. These are very different types of people.
In a few generations, we’ll only have the genes of those who really want to have children. They will be much more conservative, religious and family oriented. The Church will evolve to serve these people.

            I so want to believe this.  There are lots of children at our small church here in the Ozarks, and it’s common to see families with 2-4 towheads out eating with both parents and grandparents.  But then, just last week, we saw grandparents with just one granddaughter – a mulatto.  The threat of White extinction is still very real.

                Very much so. But the genes of those whites having kids with other whites will not only be more conservative, they’ll likely be more ethnocentric. People naturally connect to their own, but in a multi-everything world, you have to go out of your way to mate with your own kind. Even if its unconscious, these people have a natural affinity for other whites. Those genes will get passed down.

                “…just one granddaughter – a mulatto.”
Don’t ruin your day focusing on the “mulatto” part, but rather the “one” part. Oddly enough, in cases like this, DR can focus too much on the exceptions, and not realize they are doing the same thing they scream “NAXALT” about.
Merry Christmas!

            Conservative whites having more children than liberal whites is quite a recent development too. Probably not much difference until the 1990s and only really taking off in the 2010s.As the proliferation of different lifestyles takes place, people who would have been in a similar 2.5 kids white picket fence life a generation ago are now on diverging paths.One could even wonder if whites are splitting off into different ethnic groups. I don’t feel any self loathing for my heritage, nor do i idolize homosexuals, nor am i fascinated by foreign cultures. I don’t believe it’s just taught, i don’t think that i am capable of thinking and feeling the way liberals do.So are we really the same people anymore?

            Keep in mind that blacks, Muslims and Hispanics are more into having kids than whites overall. While the rest of the planet is threatened by a population collapse, Africa is growing by leaps and bounds and most want to live in your neighborhood.
But you are right that the greater birthrate among bad whites will change the culture assuming the Jews don’t succeed in subverting that trend by successfully proselytizing their ideology to the young especially young women.

                I’m inclined to disagree regarding blacks.  They aren’t so much into family as they are just irresponsible.  But even that is changing as universally, staring into one’s cell phone has become more mesmerizing than procreating.  Not fast enough, unfortunately.
It’s going to be impossible to stop the general subversion trend by our Greatest Friends and Allies.  We European Gentiles must  learn to develop immunity – to become Parasite Proof.

                    If you follow Birth Gauge on Twitter, Black total fertility was lower than White total fertility for the first time ever in 2023.
And African immigrants bring the average up. African Americans are below whites. However, about 10% of white women produce a mixed baby.
But yeah, overall the black fertility rate is no longer high. Black women are just choosing to be single and childless instead of navigating single motherhood, unless they’re really low class.

                    The issue isn’t just blacks, of course.  Back in Texas, most Indian and Chinese families (and there were a ton) had three kids – and often more until they had a boy.  The mestizos (Mexicans, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, etc.) had a minimum of three – and I’m talking LONG before 2020 and Biden’s Willkommen.   There was a public school down the block from the private Christian school my oldest attended in the late ’90s – and it was almost entirely mestizo.

        &lt;i&gt;The Gospels were not written until roughly a century after the life of Christ and his disciples.&lt;/i&gt;
Ah yes!!  The Jesuit mal-education comes to the fore.  That particular gross error has been proven wrong for roughly 40 years.  Reality?  Matthew was almost immediate; Mark &amp; Luke were finished by A.D. 50, and John’s by A.D. 100.
Merry Christmas to your bah/humbug.

            Not to mention the Septuagint was widely available in the common tongue, and the early apostles were quite adept at quoting it and applying it in their apologetics. The fact that Christ’s virgin birth was one of many fulfilled prophesies (from scripture) strengthened the argument that Jesus was the Messiah.And then there’s the inconvenient fact of how we get a New Testament anyway. The reason we have all the epistles is because the early churches knew the value in sound doctrine and in preserving the texts. They held onto the letters from Paul and the other apostles, and made as many copies as they could to share with other churches. If those letters had no scriptural value they would’ve immediately been thrown in the trash and lost to history.Dating the “creation” of the Christian Bible back to one particular moment of curation is as absurd as claiming “The Bible” only dates back to 1963, because that was when the edition I choose to use was first published.

                The fact that Christ’s virgin birth was one of many fulfilled prophesies (from scripture) strengthened the argument that Jesus was the Messiah.The Hebrew text reads almah (young woman) not bethulah (virgin) at Isaiah 7:14. The former word was mistranslated as parthenos (virgin) by the people who prepared the Septuagint, which isn’t authoritarive in Israelite religion but appears to have acquired some absurd amount of reverence in ancient times among people who didn’t know much Hebrew.Also, the passage in Isaiah doesn’t even relate to the messiah prophesy of Israel. It’s about events and circumstances contemporary to Ahaz, so even if 7:14 read bethulah, it would not provide support to the fantasy of Jesus not having a human father—which if true disqualifies Jesus from consideration as moshiach.So the story about a virginal conception fulfilling a prophecy is just bogus. You are living by an ancient delusion which can be traced back to a mundane error. There’s a good lesson to be learned from this however: Always doubt translations of the scriptures of an ancient nazi religion into which you are trying to insert yourself and your family tree.

                    The hebrew/masoretic text was compiled around the year 1000AD by jews hostile to Christ and Christians.  It is not to be trusted.  On the other hand, the Septuagint was put together the third century before the birth of Christ and is what Christ and his Apostles quoted.  FTR, the Septuagint was in greek, greek was the common language in the levant at that time.  Some spoke aramaic, but greek was what most used and is the original language of the New Testament.
So put all this hebrew text quoting in the trash bin, where it belongs.

            Yes, Z made a mistake.  The principal texts of the Hebrew prophets and their schools, plus the NT accounts, all were complete within a century of Christ’s life, with Patmos John finishing-up in Revelation.  Here is just one incident from Jeshua’s travels —‘And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.‘And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.  (Luke 4: 16-18)Here, Christ receives a document authored by Isaiah, who lived during the 8th Century B.C.

            Don’t be too harsh on him, it’s a common error. The biggest argument against the error is that none of the Gospels make any mention of the Temple’s destruction by Hadrian, despite the fact that it’s the final nail in the coffin to the opponents of Christ.

        One of the reasons the early Catholic Church thrived was it proscribed abortion, and saved unwanted children the Romans had left exposed to die, baptising the babies and raising them as their own. All life was treasured by God. See the Didache. Something similar is happening today. Ed Dutton has written on the demographics of this. Attend a Traditional Latin Mass and you will see many babies and the ladies in dresses. The TLM orders enjoy 6X the vocations for the priesthood as the Novus Order orders and dioceses. This despite the nonsense from Francis in Rome, soon to end. In your terminology, the Church is evolving again.

            For today’s clericy, Christianity is Leftist subversion or it is nothing. In other words, for such people, Christianity is nothing more than a vehicle for the Left’s ongoing destruction of the West. In point of fact, I believe most “Christian” clergy are at most, agnostic, and more likely atheistic. Some of them, what’s more, are Satanic.

            Yes. Like beware those wolves in sheep’s clothing.Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.Sadly, the wolves are running the sheep pen.  I saw a picture of a “wedding” in a Church of England “church” where the “priest” was a female and lesbian of course, “marrying” obvious trannies looking like weirdos.That is the point. To make it look as disgusting and anti-human as possible as to drive people away.  They are destroying the churches from within while driving away the faithful. They are driven away into a spiritual ghetto where they preyed upon by other progressive lunatics and (((others))) who hate Christ and who promote suffering.

        I converted to Catholicism in large part because of the… non-Biblical elements of it, the philosophical tradition, the Magisterium, the “scripture in light of tradition”, all made more sense to me than what I learned growing up in a Pentacostal household. If things that Thomas Aquinas or Augustine said still resonate with people hundreds of years later, there is no reason to think that is going to stop. The best Satan can do is work to try to get people not to read or learn about Augustine or Aquinas. Sure, he has done very well on that front in the past 200 years, but he has not totally succeeded.I think we are moving past the thankfully brief age of the openly queer “pastor” in a church his ancestors built, surrounded by gay flags talking about “social justice” or posting tiktoks about how God is nonbinary or whatever. These chuches still exist and still theoretically hold services but nobody is going to any of them. They’ve run their course. The churches I go to have young people with children. Not as many as you want to see, of course, but certainly more than there would have been in 50AD or 100AD. So, there’s reason for optimism.

            Interesting. Aquinas was the reason I decided the Catholics had lost the way.
After spending the better part of a decade on Aquinas, when I saw The Life of Brian, I perceived all the schisms of the early church in living color. We can’t count on manmade doctrine and dogma, but rather on what He is reported to have said, and the Septuagint, the only part of the Bible He got to proofread.

            Because he writes in French, Houellbecq is probably the most underrated and underestimated author by folks in the Anglosphere.
There is no other modern author who so brilliantly evokes and analyzes the ennui of existence in the Current Year GAE.

        “The Gospels were not written until roughly a century after the life of Christ and his disciples.”
This is not really accurate.  The Gospels were written within a few decades after the death of Christ by His living disciples, such as Matthew, John and Peter, or by those who spoke directly with His living disciples, such as Mark, Luke and Paul.
While this clarification is not central to Zman’s point, it is important to note that the gospels are first hand accounts, and not second or third hand accounts written after the direct witnesses were dead.

        I attend a conservative christian assembly 99% white, where men lead the congregation and women have traditional roles. I notice that a lot of young couples are having children.Purple hairs do not have as many children, I think Ed Dutton spoke about this and how evolution will gradually select for the religious over the secular.

        The various Christian denominations need to ditch the “religion” of universalism and DEI as well as allowing women and various sexual deviants into the priesthood and church upper echelons.  The old traditions need to be resurrected as it were.

        All the new-agey stuff since the 20th century is people looking for meaning. Anti-materialism and all. This is the void Christianity left.
Prosperity gospel, trying to be cool, look like own goals, and maybe so. OTOH, the carnage of the 20th could’ve been a mortal wound.
It’s a tough spot. I lean towards another Reformation of sorts. That might be possible now because of demographic turnover. More people today are disillusioned with current world than the one that died a century ago.

                The West lost faith in itself, and why not? Destroyed itself for God and Country.
Faith and nationalism need a serious reworking, because they failed in the last century. Obviously, there’s no future without them.
The sad truth is Lefty is still the heart of the West. She’s done her best in the absence of men, but she’s a train wreck on her own.

        Some behaviors are encoded in DNA and embody our most fundamental proclivities and essential habits (breathing for example). One of these is known as the “common good” allegiance gene. It is an instinctive reflect response to band together in times of great hardship or immediate threat (strength in numbers). The initial response in automatic, but sustained allegiance requires a shared set of core beliefs and group trust in those beliefs. This is the mental habit and bond that ensures cooperation and sacrifice. The eternal wisdom embodied in Christianity works, and therefore persists.

        The numbers don’t lie though – it is largely the Christians, zealous Christians, who are reproducing. I think we will see American Christianity change pretty thoroughly in the next few decades, but I think that change will be a bending back towards ancient Christianity, rather than morphing into something new.
Admittedly, I was pursuing Orthodox Christianity before I awoke on this side of politics, so I have a clear bias in this regard.

        I have been going back to the church of my youth for a while now.  It is pretty fundamental in some ways and felt legalistic growing up; now you can see the children have been leaving fora generation or twoand the pews are filled with African migrants.The conversation inside the church seems divided between the old school that want to hold an unrealistic standard of behavior, and the younger folks that want to relax standards—but the only alternative they seem to be looking at is generic liberalism, with female pastors, refugees and LGBTQ ‘acceptance’.  While the old standards have held off liberalism up to now they do not seem like they will help winning new converts.  Unless it is having strict behavioral standards that people are looking for? (Is that a part of Islam’s success?). And while it is not focused on ‘our greatest ally’ it does not seem to have a way to avoid them either.Anyway i appreciate your thoughts Zman as i am hopeful some new path can be forged. Perhaps looking at some of the early church options—Marcionism seems like it might have some good ideas, for instance.

        I would characterize the evolution of Christianity as mostly a process of making peace and allying with secular rulers…For instance, reincarnation was a fundamental belief of Essenes like Jesus, and is referred to in the Bible, but it made the rulers nervous and was deemed heretical by the 4th century Church….Similarly, a decentralized early Christianity became much more hierarchical in order to deal with the demands of secular rulers..

        Why, Z!!!What errant rot! You should be ashamed of yourself! The last guys that stamped out Christianity were the Soviets. Look at Russia now.Before them it was an endless procession of fascists, moslems, Romans, Assyrians, Ottomans…and worst of all, ruthless grifters right smack dab in the Vatican itself.Christisnity is not going to fall to intellectual derelicts like faggots, pedos and expendable and disposable politicians.The only reason these people have the upper hand now is that we live in artificially sustained prosperity in a bubble that is about to burst.The old nickel goes that there are no atheists in fox holes. We have been here before… and we are doing fine.

            Don’t downvote the guy. He may be right. Christianity has filled a void in China (and Korea, big time) that Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and then Communism left. They are taking to Christianity like a duck to water. Same thing with classical music. East Asians love those things Westerners have tossed aside.On a personal note, I have never met more “crazy Christians” than East Asians. They make Jimmy Swaggart look like Gore Vidal. Korean megachurches make Texas megachurches look like sleepy Greek Orthodox chapels. Remember the guy who thought he could convert the South Sentinelese to Christ, then got murdered by them? He was a Chinaman who went to Oral Roberts University.The near future of Christianity is emotive East Asian Protestantism, until the Africans take over and then the distant future of Christianity is Nigerian Fusionism.

                A supermajority of Chinese are atheists. There are about as many Chinese Christians per capita as there are American Jews. In China, however, the Christians have little influence. The official churches toe the Party’s line as assiduously as the established churches of Europe. Unofficial churches in people’s homes, etc. survive by not drawing too much attention to themselves.

                    I visited Taiwan not long ago and was surprised at the amount of “Merry Christmas” signage you could see, much more than i typically see here in the states.  Given that Christians are &lt;5% of the population it was funny to compare it to the push against public displays here—as long as you’re a tiny minority, you can publicly celebrate your holidays?

                Relatedly, possibly:The only non-Catholic young Christian white person I know goes to “Korean church.” I don’t know what that means. Where we live there aren’t enough Koreans to fill a church, and the few I know are devotees of the cult of “woke” managerialism, because they were good students and they’re rich now. They doregime things, not religious things. They have TVs and talk about what’s on them.Apparently there’s a fad among the kids, the white female kids, to join the “Korean church” in America. She said it to me with thatadmitting to succumbing to a trendtone girls use on old guys to preempt us asking why they’re doing some stupid girl thing. She thought I’d know. I assume TikTok could explain.

            Sure – just like classical music, amirite?  Copying something because it’s seen as high status is a far cry from organic creation of and belief in something.  Plenty of Koreans claim to be Christian, too – but despite the faith’s ‘universalist’ message, they set up their own, ethnic churches here in the US, and they still prioritize male births.  I am a believing Christian  . . . and the brain and rationality God gave me shows me that genes and ethnicity are at least equal to faith in shaping how people live.

                I don’t think there is any conflict between ethnic churches and Catholic universalism. People need to see Jesus where they are, and in a strange land that needs to be a place that speaks their language, literally. Ethnic churches eventually fade away as the future generations become more integrated (note I did not say assimilated) to the American project. I’ve seen this happen, people grow up in ethnic churches but after striking out on their own attend “regular” ones where the liturgy is in English.

                    I disagree.  Many of these churches are second generation and growing – new buildings, etc.  Even worse, many of them began by buying formerly White churches where the congregation aged out and just stopped attending.  I watched it happen.  Also note the Taiwanese Chinese establish their churches separate from the mainland Chinese, etc.  It’s total ethnic isolationism, not finding Jesus ‘where they are.’

                Man, 3g4me, I knew you were off the rails a long time ago when you said that the Chinese girl’s classical piano performance, which won some competitions, lacked something compared to a European performance. Sorry that the “chinks” made sure that their kids learned classical music that your spawn couldn’t be bothered to.  On your children, if you closed your eyes, swear that you would have been able to tell the difference. I am sure you are delusional enough to say yes.   If it wasn’t for the Vietnamese community in my neck of the woods, every one of the inner city churches would be trashed by now.  They are the ONLY ones keeping Christianity alive (the real type, not the fake Leftist type).  Maybe us whites could learn a thing or two about not running away when an undesirable moves into the neighborhood and instead protect what our forefathers created.  But I am sure you are too far deep into the Ozarks to be worried about such details 3g4me.  Amirite?  But you had to throw in a pot shot against the Koreans for “killing girls in favor of boys” ( I know what you you wrote, I also know what you meant). If you are right, every one of the Korean girls that survived ended up at my school but none of the boys.  I wonder where they went?  What will you and your other 20 survivalist “families” do when diversity pays you a visit?

                    That’s a bit harsh. She’s just been so blackpilled that it appears to be hard to see a silver lining in any cloud. It’s probably irrational to let yourself get so worked up about stuff you can’t do anything about.
I do have some sympathy for what you are saying, though. There is a small splinter of traditionalist Lutheran clergy who might be able to pull the fat out of the fire, and if the Methodists can be saved, it’s Africans in Africa. Catholics, probably not. Definitely not at scale.

                        Fair enough sir.  I have always told my kids that their energy would better spent on bettering oneself and correcting one’s own flaws. The good Lord knows I have way too many flaws to keep track of.   Talking about how other people are crappy is counter productive.  It is ok to acknowledge other races in a non derogatory light and still focus on my own people. As a proud Catholic, I have hope for us and the Orthodox more than the protestant denominations….BUT I hope they succeed also rather than assuming they won’t.

                            I, too, hope for the best. I just fear that Catholicism is too deeply rooted in the relatively recent principle ofex cathedra.  In retrospect, many of the doctrines put in place were in error, but until Catholics reject papal infallibility, and essentially become Protestants with better hats and sense of architecture, I’m pretty sure most will be led into error.
Yeah, I know Tridentine Mass is a Middle Ages thing, so we can’t talk about it as early church tradition. At some point, we have to accept that anything created by man is flawed, and that includes papal bulls.

                    The “only ones keeping Christianity alive” reminds me of the handful of white Canadians who have taken it upon themselves to carve new totems for an Amerindian band living along a stretch of coast in British Columbia. Apparently the elders have neglected this, and their extant totems have rotted in the wet climate. It doesn’t bode well for the perpetuation of their culture. Twenty survivalist families in the Ozarks is better than they’ve got.

                        A congregation of a 1000 in the church a half mile from my house that is full. every Sunday morning with Moms/Dads/multiple kids per family/Grandmas and Grandmas. is a heck of a lot better than 20 survivalist families.  And this is not the only one.  A handful of families had the courage to move in to the blight and gentrified entire neighborhoods in half a generation. The houses are glowing currently with Christmas lights and crosses. It is wonderful.

            I very much doubt it that it will die here and live on there. But it will live on there as well as here. Jesus gave his disciples the Great Commission. The Great Commission in simple terms was for his disciples to go out and preach the Gospel to the four corners of the world. But He didn’t say anything about sponsoring mass movements of people to move from one corner of the world and invade the living space of people in another corner of the world.

        I don’t know. What I learned in school was that Christianity developed and spread as a form of Judaism with a more conciliatory God, and because monotheism became regarded as more sophisticated and less barbarian than paganism and the polytheistic predecessors. When I look back, all I can see and say is that the monotheistic claims of the Big 3, in particular of Christianity, are pretty much bogus, with all those sons, mothers, saints and prophets added, we might as well have stuck to the Greek and Roman Gods in that regard. And the track record of all 3 in practice with regard to humanism and tolerance is also just a disaster.Do I have decided to try to adhere to Do not steal! and to the Golden rule, to believe that there is in the end just one God/creator whoever it may be and however many sons, demi-Gods, saints or helpers he has, but if it turns out that it’s the eye for an eye, the 70 virgin for a kill one or one that sends me back to Earth as a rat, it’s not the one and the ones message I believed in and I don’t want to have anything to do with him anyway thenAs for any of the churches who preach this sh*t, go figure….
