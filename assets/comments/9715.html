        Poor social justice warriors. How do we raise the ratings of women’s sports since everyone knows that women should be paid the same as men for the same work? I have a suggestion. Let women play topless.I am from Texas and was unaware of the wrestling tranny until I visited relatives and got something on the news. I then read about it the next day in the paper. Amazing. First of all, I wasn’t even aware that there was wrestling for girls except in venues with large amounts of mud. Only parents and pervs would watch. But, I saw the 5 minute segment on a Dallas news program the first night I got there. The sound was off and I was watching what looked like an adolescent boy wrestling a girl. I could tell one was a girl because of the knobs on her chest. I turned the sound up because the text scrolling across the bottom indicated that some tranny was wrestling someone. Turns out both were girls but one was receiving male anabolic steroids so she could be a he. How is this fair? But, the comments on the news were about how everyone at the school and all the parents “supported” this mentally ill person. Except, of course, for some unreasonable haters that objected to their daughters wrestling someone with male hormones. This was about the inevitable madness that comes when a certain number of brain damaged people pretend that there are no rules to reality and that everything is subjective. The will pat themselves on the back about how progressive they are, completely unconcerned with how ridiculous they are and what damage they are doing to entire generations of people. May the Apocolypse come soon.

            None of the women playing pro golf would be any more worth watching topless. The Williams sisters playing tennis would be, because that would be hilarious.

                Granted this was a while ago, 2004, but I was a volunteer at the Women’s US golf open. I was amazed at how good looking many of the players were- and how fashionable . The first golfer I say after getting out of my car was Suzanne Petersen – VA VA Voom!

                They’ve gotten better looking over the years (excluding some  of the heavy block-like Asians), but I don’t think going “topless” is playing to their  strengths.  Most good women golfers  have pretty small hooters – big ones impede  a good golf swing.

                    By “they”, I meant the womens golfers.  Tennis players have stayed about the same, I think, with occasional exceptions like  Pornakova.

                    Back when I used to do archery I soon noted, being male and aware of certain areas of female anatomy, that women archers often wore a kind of mesh ‘suppressor’ over one breast so drawing a bow was not impeded. Archers at club level were always mixed with male and female shooting together and even people with disabilities were there too. I recall a certain annoyance from some that the guy in the wheelchair not only had much bigger muscles in his arms and shoulders (understandably so) but had a sort of more stable shooting position. Fully abled had a greater challenge with keeping the same position because at longer ranges even the tiniest shift in position and angle could put an arrow an inch the wrong side of your intention. My intention, being not very good, was to merely hit the target. But Joe in the wheelchair was literally rock solid.Then I read, by the way, that amazon archers resorted — legend has it — to cutting one breast off. Topless archery there would only be half the fun some might say.

            Volley ball is a great sport for girls. It is much more of a point to point sport so it plays to the female spatial awareness. But, it will never have a TV audience, beach or otherwise.

                I actually used to watch women’s pro-volleyball back in the 80’s.  That sport died with Flo Hyman.
One thing that makes it watchable is they simply lower the net half a foot for the ladies – so it doesn’t look as ridiculous as women’s basketball.  Doesn’t hurt that female volleyball players are often attractive.

        I used to have a pretty dim view of figure skating, but my wife has always loved it.  For her birthday, I took her to Skate America which was a big national competition that was in our neighborhood.  I’ll tell you what, I went in with one idea of figure skating and left with another one.  First, the competitors you see on TV Scott Hamilton and Dick Button, represent about 1/10th of the competitors.  The other 9/10ths don’t get on television.  Why?  Because they fall down.  A lot.But the thing you don’t get to see – or rather, hear – is the sickening sound of a thinly clad skater hitting the ice at 30mph.  The best I could describe it would be to take a thawed rack of ribs, and drop it from 30 ft onto the ice.  It’s this crunchy-splatty kind of sound……and the kids get right back up, smile, and keep right on going.I wouldn’t walk for a week if I landed like that on ice.  No helmets, no padding, no refs throwing flags.  They just get up and skate it off.  After they’re done, they walk over to the “kiss and cry” area (yes, it’s gender neutral), and they still don’t show how much pain they are obviously in.It’s not like I became a sudden convert to the sport, and I’ve never been to a live event since.  But I do respect those kids a lot more than I did before I walked into the arena.  I’ve watched NFL games where a guy in body armor dives onto a padded turf field, has to be carried off the field, has 5 trainers tending to him, and doesn’t finish the game…and on Monday’s injury report “possible bruised thigh, listed as probable for next Sunday”.

            It’s what I tell people about boxing. Go to an armory fight and you walk away with a very different view of boxing. Rodeo is another that has to be seen live to have any clue about what happens. TV both sanitizes and distorts.

            Yep. Been on the ice when a kid catches their toe pick and slams into the boards coming out of a serious jump. It’s painful to watch. Especially if they’re working on a particularly difficult jump and their coach is getting them to do it over and over. By about the fourth time falling hard they get up very slowly.
I’ve fallen hard enough to bruise and send shock waves across the ice. But then I’m a middle-aged woman with a bit more meat on my bones than those kids. Nevertheless it hurts like hell.

        A boy-to-girl transgenderite just won a championship in Texas, pinning everybody along the way. This will happen more and more until all the athletes in women’s sports will be men. This sets up the clash between feminism and transgenderism, which itself will be way more fun to watch than the WNBA. I predict the transgenderites will win because they are stronger and better at math, critical thinking and PR. At that point all sports will be all men all the time, which will require the government to pass Title 9 1/2, mandating equal participation for “real” girls. Then the cycle will start again. Oh brave new world…

                Yeah, it was a girl to boy.  To her/his credit, she/he/it wanted to compete as a boy, but they made it compete as a girl (since that’s how it was born).  But the testosterone it was taking as part of the treatment undoubtedly gave it a huge advantage over the girls.

                It’s just a matter of time until it goes the other way, and the lawsuits start demanding equal access.  When the boys can “identify” a certain way just to gain a competitive advantage, you’ll see whatever self-righteous piety flowing from women evaporate.

                    In Massachusetts if you have a boy who wants to play field hockey, and you don’t have a boys’ team you MUST let him play on the girls’ team. I can’t fathom it. People will say that girls play on boys’ teams- ice hockey in particular, but they are not equivalent. I really don’t think girls should be on boys’ teams period, but at least, if I had a daughter I would be making the decision to put her on the ice with biggerstrongerfaster boys. The other field hockey parents made no such decision, but there is their daughter playing against boys. Some girl will get badly hurt- and lawyers will have a feast. We have gone batshit crazy.

        Skating is too white. Remember the last big coverage was back when a black girl was in contention. Watch what happens to tennis when the Williams sisters are gone. WNBA–a bunch of black lesbians–as long as it’s like this they’ll get attention out the wazoo, no sign of that ever changing. It will be on TV even if no one at all is watching. They give tickets to local organizations and businesses to get folks to go to the local NBA and WNBA games. If it weren’t for TV contracts they’d be broke. Cable cutting will be the death of pro basketball. If we had ala carte cable/satellite, it would be gone already.

            Also, figure skating used to be a thing of grace and beauty, including the music.  The last time I watched, it seemed near porn set to raucous sound.  Maybe it’s just my ‘old fart’ showing, but even my wife has given up on it and she used to be a faithful watcher, at least for the olympics. Seems the Hollywood elite culture coarsens everything it touches.

                what has greatly parcipitated the drop in womens figure skating popuarity among whites or the very few blacks is the rise in popularity of womens ice hockey. Go to any rink, most asian girls you see will be the figure skaters; many of the American girls you see there will have hockey skates, pads, lids &amp; twigs (helmets &amp; hockey sticks, for the uninitiated). much as very few guy skaters would even think of lacing up figure skates (frankly, because that would be gay) so now the ladies.

                    I think you’re right. I skate regularly here in San Francisco, and almost all the girls on the ice for the early morning before school sessions are Asian, mainly Chinese. There are a couple of white girls, and they are Russian. The lone boy is around 12 years old and he is Vietnamese. Over the span of the 6 years that I’ve been at the rink, the number of young white girls strapping on the padding and working hard in the hockey clinics has increased.Figure skating killed the golden goose in the mid-90s by overexposure. You couldn’t turn the channel without there being some half-baked exhibition or competition being presented. And, this was also about the time that compulsory figures were eliminated from competition. You know, the actual skills needed to prove mastery of the sport. Not to mention the ages of the kids competing. Dorothy Hamill in her Olympic prime would have no chance now.

                They changed the scoring system several years ago to reduce the subjectivity. So the way to do well now is to do as many elaborate jumps and spins as possible, rather than skate beautifully. The programs are much less pretty to watch now.

            I remember at a Vikings-Packers game at Lambeau one Vikings fan holding up a sign that said “Hey Green Bay, where’ s YOUR WNBA championship?”Like much of modern life, women’s sports have taken something good and made it into something ridiculous. Opening up opportunities for girls to experience the joys of competition was probably good, making it compulsory was not. “All that’s not forbidden is compulsory!!”

                    Yeah, it was hard to keep track at first. My assumption was it was a boy pretending to be a girl so he could beat up girls. Instead it is a girl full of male hormones beating up girls.

                    Drake, the kid wanted to and was unable to due to Texas law.  You must compete with sex from your birth.  Obviously, I would think when they passed that law/rule, this eventuality was not even considered.  The girl has been taking massive testosterone for her change.  That’s doping… BUT.. since we’re in the rabbit hole with the Mad Hatter, it’s all mixed up and no one can complain because the PC police will jump in.  Heh.  Social engineering , ain’t it great?

                        The problem with changing the rules of course is that some guy will decide he’s a chick and win the state championship easily.  There was an episode of “Married with Children” in which Al was invited to an elderly olympics meet and had a great time beating down all the geezers.  Funny how life imitates the most absurd art eventually.

                    Was a competitive rower until I was thirty.  When we first started having  coaches coming over from the Eastern bloc to coach the national teams and development camps a lot of us started developing all sort of overuse injuries from the new training loads.  Turns out most of the athletes they worked with in Russia, Poland and East Germany were regularly doped–but it was compartmentalized from the coaches.  So they simply thought that athletes could handle that sort of mileage and intensity.  We could have, if we had regular low dose steroids to speed recovery.  We were all clean, so we broke down.  Over time they adjusted, but boy was the learning period painful.

                        I recall reading about how many of the women from the DDR sports teams had horrible lives after their career. The physical damage and the psychological damage was severe. There’s long been a suspicion that steroid abuse results in long term psychological effects on men. We know, for example, that very low testosterone levels can result in depression and suicide. Steroid abuse destroys the body’s natural production of testosterone so guys who go off the gear will suddenly be faced with a new problem, that is remedied by taking steroids, ironically. Whether there are changes in brain chemistry that far outlast the doping is unknown, but suspected.My guess is females taking large quantities of male growth hormones probably suffer unique challenges. I don’t know of any studies on the matter, but my guess is the wild swings in hormone levels sets off some unpredictable hormone swings after they go off the gear.

                        I read that in 2013, “…167 former DDR athletes would be financially compensated through Germany’s Olympic Committee for the systematic doping of DDR athletes from 1973 through 1989. When told of this fact, Shirley Babashoff’s first comment was, “Only 167 Athletes!”  whole article here …https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/dopings-darkest-hour-the-east-germans-and-the-1976-montreal-games/The final relay for the women in Montreal – the 4×100 free – was a throwdown moment in swimming – a sport with a dearth of such things.   It’s on youtube but the video is not great and the camera shots focus primarily on the USA team so you can’t gauge the size differential.  One interesting thing to note is De Varona’s commentary about Title IX just coming on line, blah, blah, blah…. and that’s why our women are getting waxed in the pool. To this day, I would guess that the average age of the women world record holders is significantly lower than that of the men.

        Zman, you could have said “Female athletes used to be featured on Wheaties boxes, now they could be on milk cartons.”But I think it is an interesting question: where have the female athletes gone?In many Olympic sports, the women’s record would not even qualify for the men’s event, that is, the women’s world record performance in the event would not meet the cut for the men’s event.Tennis players, across generations, have stated that tournament-winning female tennis players would be beaten easily by unranked men.And before anyone brings Bobby Riggs:Bobby Riggs was a very good tennis player and a hustler of the first magnitude. He made a lot of money hustling on tennis courts around the world, just like the pool-hustler Paul Newman character.Yes, he lost to Billy Jean King in a highly-publicized match. But how did the Billy Jean King match get so much hype.Riggs had first challenged Margaret Court. Who was she? Shame on you! Margaret Court was the #1 ranked female tennis player at the time, and had recently won Wimbledon. Riggs was 55 years old. Riggs beat her 6-1, 6-2.Riggs created enormous hype with the match with King, and turned it into a big payday. Everyone was taken and Riggs cleaned up by losing.

        I. for one, welcome the end of all women’s sport by the forced participation of “trans-gendered” “men”.  No biological women will ever win a major sporting event again once the Left gets its way on this point.

        Women’s sports are generally uninteresting because men’s high school teams are far superior to women’s professional teams. Why watch something that is just inferior? Particularly awful is the WNBA, where the absence of upper body strength (50% less than men), jumping ability, and speed turns the game into a travesty…

        From what I can see, middle class and better white parents do a lot of sports (or dance) with their daughters because it plumps up the college resume and keeps teenaged girls in a relatively healthy, wholesome environment doing something tiring so they don’t get into trouble. Another activity that offered this would probably be welcomed, particularly for those with unathletic daughters. You can’t have teenaged girls around every afternoon and weekend unsupervised, so a job or family duties or youth theater or something has to be there.

            My neighbor and good friends put 3 of their girls through college on full-ride soccer scholarships.  All three got worthless degrees, married and got careers in nothing to do with their degrees.  Title XI and it’s twisted effects on higher education is stunning to me, but I’m old.  Universities are run by women, and women attend at higher rates than men.  But it’s not enough!  They demand moar!!  Because….  because!

                The stupid thing about Title Nine requirements is that boys are vastly more interested in sports than girls are. This starts in childhood, where boys will organize spontaneous games of soccer or baseball and continues into adulthood. Absent mandates, a small university could probably field several men’s basketball or soccer teams, allowing less capable but interested athletes to play. My college had a number of non school sponsored men’s sports teams because demand for slots on teams significantly outstripped supply. The players would fundraise for their own uniforms and supplies and organize matches with other schools and so on. Meanwhile the school was desperately trying to get girls to sign up to run cross country to keep the participant numbers up.

                    I recall an argument from a Title IX supporter. It went something like this: Girls are just as interested in sports participation as boys. They just don’t realize it. They must be told (or sold) that it is OK to want to participate.

                    Now that you bring it up, Marina, when I was eight years old (this would be Eisenhower’s second heart attack), myself and a gaggle of other yuts of similar age attacked a wild field just behind our new development, tore up the weeds and bushes, cut down a few trees, picked up bushels of rocks, and shoveled and raked for a week. We played baseball and football there for two years. We never saw an adult, or a girl.

        I think the fall of women’s gymnastics and skating is in large part  a delayed consequence of the end of the Cold War.  Nobody really cares anymore whether our female athletes beat the Russians, (East) Germans, Bulgarians, Romanians, etc.  Or even the Chinese.  The Olympics  seemed  to drive the popularity of those sports, in my opinion.

            That’s a possibility, but it was not so long ago that we had traveling ice shows that sold out big arenas. Women loved taking their daughters to those things. Now they are all gone. I think your point works much better for gymnastics, which has always been an every four year thing.

                Yeah, we had the Ice Capades, which were popular with women.  But, at least in my adult lifetime, and maybe even when I was a teen in the late 70s, the main attractions always seemed to be popular and well known only as a result of being Olympic medalists.   Gave them a vehicle to keep skating and monetize their Olympic success.

        Btw, did you know that the boys high school track and field world records are higher, faster, and farther than most (if not all) of the women’s world records?  That shouldn’t be too surprising, but in our “everybody is all the same” age, it’s easy to lose sight of that.  I remember being told that a few years ago, so I looked up both.  Although I wasn’t terribly surprised, it was amusing when you consider that high school boys generally do not have the training regimen of olympic women athletes.

        What’s killing ”Women’s” (little girls really) gymnastics and figure skating is the expense in both time and money. If married (and of course, with a job) the mothers simply don’t have enough spare time or energy to invest in lessons/training/travel/competition that gymnastics and figure skating require. Getting little Sally to all those several hour lessons/practice/training and then competitions is literally a full time job – unpaid, and in fact rather costly. If a ‘single’ Mom, she not only has even less time and energy, she also probably can’t afford the expenses involved.In Europe and Asia the promising young gymnasts and skaters get separated from the family and the girl’s main occupation is training, ect. – complete with her living in dorms, and schooling tailored around preparing for the sport. In the US that life is neither supported culturally nor with exclusive (and isolated) facilities. Not to mention the increasing physical and sexual abuse scandals in both sports.Like you mentioned Women’s basketball is uninteresting and the only reason the WNBA hasn’t folded is due to heavy subsidies from the NBA (and for one of the teams, a casino) and has always needed them. The LPGA used to have stars in the entertainment industry take up the game and their ‘star power’ drew attention to it. Boomer/Xer/Millenial celebs are too busy with their sex and drug lives to have the time or energy for golf.

        Define the issue better. Is it trying to attract more female viewers for women’s sport or trying to attract more more male viewers?If it is the latter the answer is attractive women moving around in skimpy costumes. That rules out WNBA, golf, and baseball. Skating, tennis, and Lingere Football have a chance. If its the former ask a woman, I can’t guess.

        I don’t care if they can’t play worth a damn. I still love to watch the girls jump around in NCAA basketball.
It’s on cable anyway, so why not? Of course, I certainly wouldn’t pay anything to watch them play. OK, maybe a buck or two if they were naked.
That’s the solution to the WNBA problem with viewership. Have all the lezbos turn out nude to play.
Guys will turn out to see the games and pay for the privilege.
