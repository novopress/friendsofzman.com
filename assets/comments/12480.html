        I predict the beginning of a cooling trend will cause global warmists to shift their theories to claim carbon emissions block the sun’s rays, or some other ridiculous explanation, and then claim that 97% of scientists agree, in complete contradiction to their previous certainty.  The 180 degree shift will occur with no shame or doubt.

            They’re already way ahead of you, unfortunately.  For several years they’ve been labeling any kind of extreme weather as “anthropogenic global climate change.”  You’re right: no shame or doubt.
In spite of that, best wishes to all the Z-fans for an excellent 2018!

        I predict the femzombies will be blindsided by a tsunami-sized male backlash largely fueled by flipped liberal males who were accused, but denied due process.  Immune to irony, those benefiting the most from affirmative action laws, white women, will set the wheels in motion to bring it to an end.

            Spot on about the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action. And they seem to be blithely oblivious to it, and how destructive it is to their ability to form families, as well. There aren’t enough beta males to go around to be Mr. Mom. Not so bad being superwoman up until you hit 45. Then the fatigue sets in, productivity wanes, and it’s a total grind getting to retirement. No wonder they want the welfare state and immigration, too. Problem is, it was designed when men were the breadwinners and male type productivity the norm.

        Why Trump has allowed the Mueller investigation to go on is becoming obvious now.  It is the Democrats, and especially Hillary and Obama and their people, who have been the ones breaking the laws and abusing the system.  The Russian Dossier and wire taps and all that.  For 2018, the Mueller investigation will complete the job of exposing the wrongdoers, and they are not Trump.  The Donald has stood by while Mueller dug a deeper and deeper hole for his people.  Lots of discipline and a calculated risk on Trump’s part in doing so.  Had he cracked down on Mueller, the whole conspiracy would have had a much harder time finding the light of day.

            Trump my be playing the long game but only because his own swamp rhetoric was timid in comparison to the reality of DC and the force that has to be overcome. Now he knows. We shall see soon enough if he has organized to take them down. I have no idea, but the man is full of surprises.

            Dansidea – I agree, great blog. Thank you, Zman.
One quibble; David Fischer’s Albion’s Seed is too important a work to not read, Zman. It looks longer than it really is, about a third of its volume taken up with footnotes and historiography. It’s the best history book on America’s beginning that exists. Explains so much about who we are and why we do the things we do. Hope you read it some day.

                re: Albion’s Seed
Reality has eclipsed Albion’s Seed as a NEW RELEVANT screed is needed. I propose some scholar write Mexico’s Seed including all of Latin America’s and the Caribbean’s Seed written in both Spanish &amp; English on facing pages. Ok, just in Spanish is fine as the Democrats to gain votes will soon make Spanish America’s legal Language.

        100% agree on the House/Senate.  Too many House races for the GOP to put all the fires out, so to speak. Gerrymandering will save them from losing the majority, however. But the numbers favor the GOP (by sheer chance) in the Senate because more Dems are up for re-election this time around. The media will portray the gains in the House as a “mandate” that America as a whole hates Trump.

            Yep.  All have found themselves “on the menu” in the past and I detect zero appetite for another round of that.  The Polacks in particular.  They are a flinty lot, much harder than the Westerners.  I think they will eat Brussels alive.

        I predict a failure of Bannonism against the establishment, unless Bannon does something major to put forth more than Tea Party lite/middling/bland/unprepared candidates that  are not hugely distinctive from the GOP offerings, in the grand scheme of things. Another batch of normie Zionists are not going get people excited.In that same vein, I predict the continued decline of milquetoast civic nationalism. Pushing hard against immigration without distinguishing the racial nature of the problem will continue to be a losing hand.I predict the further decline &amp; marginalization of the NeoCons, with the more prominent openly making their way leftward to NeoLiberalism, w/ some completing the journey.I predict DACA “kids” getting amnesty, in exchange for wall funding, and an end to chain migration and/or a large reduction to H1B Visas, maybe end of Visa lottery system, possibly e-verify. It won’t be a great deal, but a compromise that the GOP pushes Trump to take, before the 2018 elections, which will be a huge mistake.Happy New Year, everyone!

            Trump coming to an understanding with the establishment GOP and them working in tandem is the big story. Only it is the establishment that moves more than Trump. They are beginning to realize that he’s the one with the mandate and he isn’t going anywhere.Watch Orrin Hatch talking about the tax bill. He’s so happy he looks like he’s going to cry.I think Bannon moderates his tone in tune with this change in the environment and he ends up helping the GOP retain some of the base who might be prone to stay home during elections. They will tolerate him saying a few slightly inflammatory things just to keep the train moving.

                In the 80’s and 90’s, I would wear a T-shirt for the 1918 World Series Red Sox, whenever I was around Yankee fans. The “1918” chant does not resonate anymore.

        Fox News is reporting Susie Buell of Esprit Clothing put up $500,000 trying to find any woman to accuse Trump of impropriety.

        Here are three predictions:1. Another high-profile leftist male will get devoured by Hillary’s Harpie Praetorian Guards alleging harassment. Maybe Bill Maher (he’s so sleazy that accusations against him may be met with a shrug, but it would be beautiful to see him gored by the leftist ox, with some charges that he harassed or raped someone; he’s survived these in the past, so he may be Teflon, but a guy can hope).2. Ben Shapiro will have some sort of weepy, Glenn Beck sort of meltdown after one too many antisemitic memes hits his twitter feed, and he’ll be writing for Huffington Post about how he saw the light. I’d hedge this with a Gavin McInnes doing something similar, though it would be something like a lucrative TV or book offer that might get him to switch from alt-light to prog loon. I could even see Milo doing this.3. Escalating violence against Christians in Pakistan and Iraq provides a chance for Trump’s foes among the neocons to sell him on a boots-on-the-ground fiasco in another Middle Eastern shit hole. The media’s clarion of “Trump is being presidential/serious” works on him (as it has in the past) and he becomes George W. Bush, in essence, losing even his qualified support among the alt-right. Bannon and Sessions are totally handcuffed, and Washington goes back to business as usual. The Deep State is so confident at this point that they lay off the Russiagate stuff and Trump’s poll numbers climb.

            For many “right wing” media types their posturing is calculated to garner attention while not crossing certain lines, so that when it is convenient they can transition into a more mainstream, or even left wing venue.IOW it isn’t about the movement, it is about them and shekels.Right now Shapiro is paid well by pro-zionist evangelicals to say what they want, and their goals coincide. If the money runs out on such gigs, or if the opportunity to move into an establishment organ presents itself with the only requirement being a slight shift to the left, he will do it.There is a niche market for “right wingers” to be a kept opposition for media political theater. And the merchant right is positioning itself to fill that niche.I look at it like my specialty. The average age of people in it is old. Huge opportunity for people willing to work hard enough to do it. Look at how old George Will is.

        Good call on electric bicycles. There is a lot of ferment in this field right now. It’s definitely going to take off in the cities, as people sitting in their cars in traffic jams see their associates getting to work without problems.
Still wondering when the other shoe (of economic crash through debt) is going to drop. An infrastructure bill will probably make Obama’s deficits look modest.

                That and the continued rise of telecommuting. Some business has to be done in person, but lots of things can be done from home. Federal contractors were onto this early. Twenty years ago a buddy’s wife worked a a contract admin from home. She had two little kids to watch so it worked for her. She had to be logged in during work hours and her productivity was tracked, to make sure she was doing her job, but otherwise, she stayed home.

            Also suspect the EU is going to be in a two front war.  They’ve raised the ante with Poland and  Hungary on refugees. The Polacks in particular have seen this how this play works out for them in the past and seem to be in a BFYTW mood with the Hungarians right behind them.  Don’t see them compromising one bit, which is a huge challenge to Brussels.

                The young and healthy will pull out. Their participation was and is the foundation of the ACA. Only the takers will remain. The insurance companies will continue to pull out.

                    This only applies to the individual market. In my state, only seven percent of the population is in the individual market. Nationally it is around 10%. My guess is very few young people are in that pool, as it is mostly professionals and the self-employed. That’s a middle-aged crowd and older.
I’m not willing to place any bets on what happens with insurance markets. Our rulers have built a machine too complicated to reform or control.

It’s funny, I don’t think I have a good speaking voice, but I have gotten better as I’ve been doing it. The trick, it seems, is to maintain an even pace. The temptation to rush when speaking into the mic is almost overwhelming. I’ve started using the software to slow the tempo, which seems to help.

                    You’re just proving Z right. There was a huge bureaucracy built to administer the ACA, and that isn’t going anywhere. What you’re actually describing is the fates of the exchanges.

        Lose all 162 games! Not likely. Suppose they have a 95% chance of losing any one game, and the all the games are statistically independent. Then there is about two and a half chances out of 10,000 they will lose all 162 games. Of course this model not realistic because the games are not all independent as the team remembers past games. A string of loses will could cause them to get discouraged and bump up that loss probability. On the other hand, a losing streak could provoke corrective action improving their play. We need a more realistic model to do forecasting, but I think your prediction is way off.

        As a half-assed Red Sox fan I appreciate the Yankee prediction 🙂
Funny you should mention the electric bicycles. Seems to be an uptick in their media exposure.
Happy New Year to you and yours and thanks for the work you do here at the Z – man blog. !

        I suspect folks are not going to like this prediction but the loss of Net Neutrality along with “we are in charge” sloth will quite a few  Republican losses in the House elections unless real effort is made otherwise,
It might, might be enough to end Republican control of the house.

        So how do you think the elections will ultimately turn out?
I’m predicting -10 for the GOP in the House but +6 in the Senate.

        That the Yankees will lose all 162 games is one of the silliest things ever since they will have beaten the winless Red Sox multiple times.

            My advice is to never get preemptively disappointed. Guys like Spencer and Hunter Wallace seem to think the way forward for their movements is to get angry now about things that may or may not happen in the future. It’s borrowing against the future that comes with a big interest penalty.
I’ll wait to see what happens and then respond accordingly.

            1. The Democrats will have to take the Senate and get enough Republicans to vote with them. Both are doubtful.2. Massive? Based on what? They might take the House, but too many Dems are up for election in the Senate. You are predicting a wave year which rarely happens. Trump is not that unpopular. Remember all politics are local. You can’t generslize from one or two states. A massive recession might do it, but the very opposite is the trend.3. Huh? What are you smoking? The Europeans hate diversity because they are a collection of nations with a long history. Nationalist parties are gaining, not losing.I think you are just trying to be provocative unless you can articulate the reasons for your predictions.
