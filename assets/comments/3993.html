        The interesting thing for me is people giving their kids an unusual name in the hope they stand out from the pack. It’s like da yoof who insist on wearing a baseball cap at a certain angle or have tattoos up their neck because no one else does. Except of course the hundred kids around them all with the same lack of style in headgear and equally bad taste in cheap tattoos.It may be hard to imagine for a young parent that say Angel Pretty might not turn out to be as named, or Khaleesi doesn’t make the grade as a bold leader of warriors after all, but the naming comes easy. Especially when much-admired mindless singers and inane actors insist on giving their children ridiculous names too.Many people are not descended from apes. They are the ones that ape.
