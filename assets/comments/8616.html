        This is why we must elect Donald Trump.  Elect der Trumpenfuhrer, and I promise you that the Media and the federal bureaucracy (assuming there’s a functional difference at this point) will suddenly be VERY interested in even the hint of an allegation of an impropriety.  President Trump won’t be able to cheat at Solitaire without a blue ribbon Congressional commission and a twelve part expose in the New York Times.

            That’s what cancels out any worries about what Trump might do. The Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself), academia, the bureaucracy, “law” “enforcement” and the-butt sore central apparatchiks in his own party hate him and would be hot to impeach him or at least thwart anything he tried that looked suspicious. The Congress and the courts would rediscover their function as coequal branches of government. We might remember what checks and balances are.

                Sure, the permanent, unelected government might rediscover checks and balances in order to fight him on every little detail of: the Trumpenwall, deporting 100 million foreigners, restoring marriage to its proper patriarchal order, improving White (American) fertility, making the military a masculine institution again, nuking the Ivy League, restoring manufacturing industry, eliminating the government debt, and slipping a knife between the ribs of the Federal Reserve.So Trump doesn’t fire 90% of Washington and he doesn’t become God-Emperor, and also doesn’t accomplish much of anything else.And then what? In 8 years, the permanent, unelected government creaks back into gear, White genocide resumes, the nation formerly known as America becomes indistinguishable from Brazil, and that’s the permanent, irrevocable end of Western civilization.Bring on the age of Caesars, I say.

Seems the President can fire any Federal employee without Congressional over site.

                    Nobody is going to cure a century of metastasizing government and proggie lunacy in one administration. Stopping the downward slide for 8 years is preferable to letting it accelerate for 8 years. Gridlock is our friend for now. It’s up to sane and responsible people to use such a breather to organize and start arsing themselves to fix things. If we don’t try, we’re permascrewed. We might be screwed anyway, but why give up? Eight years of Obama’s abuses and usurpations should be enough to scare the normals into action.

                        The trouble is that the next crazy always turns into the new normal. Most people won’t believe the waters getting hot until they see the bubbles.
And even then, it’s “If only Comrade Stalin knew!”

Yeah totally man, we just need another 10 years to totally get the naturally conservatarian Hispanics onboard with English Common Law and the Right of the Weal.  It’ll totally happen bro.

Z – I’m surprised any FB’y would go fishing or hunting in the woods. Maybe that was in olden times.

                    I’ll tell you then what. If we are wise, we use this time to hold an Article 5 Convention of States, and we pass the Liberty Amendments on their DC asses! That’s what. If The POTUS Trump got behind it with his Master Persuader skills, it could be done in 5 years.

                        You have way too much confidence in the public, Fred. They ratified the 16th Amendment 103 years ago, and it’s been downhill ever since. Conservative of that day figured they’s shut up the progressive yammering by passing the income tax in Congress and putting it put to the States for a sound rejection.

                            Little did they know the Proggies would lie, cheat and steal the ratification elections! To this day there is serious, if very quiet, debate as to whether the ratification was accomplished in legal fashion.

            I’m hoping for the Trumpenfuhrer precisely because I want this charade to end with the blood-dripping hammer in my team’s hand.The fiction of our Republic ended long before I was ever born.  The “we can’t do that, what if the Dems do it” bullshit doesn’t faze me anymore, BECAUSE THE DEMS HAVE ALREADY FUCKING DONE IT.  All.  All of it.  Every form of corruption and abuse of power imaginable the fucking Dems and their Benetton Army of subhuman shitskin monkeys have inflicted on me and mine.  All while the Jew lugenpresse and enabler GOP cucks looked on silently.Fuck ’em.I want Trump to have public executions and show trials and I want him to laugh at Congress when they try to impeach him.  “Where’s your Army pendejo?”I know that’s not likely to happen, but it’s what I’m praying for.

                @Karl Horst, I wish it were original to me (and knew how to make umlauts in html).  Alas, I’m not that clever.  But as Commissioner of Ballistic Punishments, I’ll need you to devise proper…motivation… for people to refer to him correctly.  Including the article — I assume it’s “die Trumpenfuhrer”?  (N.b. to  lurking NSA men, this is a question about German grammar).  I get the impression “der” is for direct objects…?

                    @ Severian – In German, der, die and das are definite articles for masculine (der), feminine (die) and neuter (das). In this case “Der Trumpenführer” would be correct.
Here is a link to foreign ASCII characters:http://www.theasciicode.com.ar/
As for motivation…I think the words Sieg and Heil have already been used. And I would definitely avoid anything with the right arm in the air. 🙂

        Not only did Comey go in the tank for Hilary, his FBI has given too many domestic terrorists a free pass. How many Islamic madmen is it now who have been “interviewed” by the FBI and let go? They of course hide behind the “civil rights” of the madmen. Or they say it’s a resource issue. I don’t believe it. I could understand administration lackeys like Josh Ernst and Jeh Johnson adopting and facilitating Obama’s love of Islam, but the FBI? The rule of law is a joke while Obama is president.

            I used to fish with a guy who was a field agent. He used to work drug cases, but got reassigned to terrorism in DC. He said he would quit, but he was hanging in for the pension. The reason he wanted to quit is he did nothing. He said it was all office politics and if you did not like that you drove around all day killing time.

                Our pet FBI agent years ago spent at least 5 years beyond his retirement age just to bulk up his pension.  Then he lasted about a year and poof dead.  Those were the days post Bobby when gambling was the game.
It was obvious that you could kill someone in broad daylight and they would ignore it if it wasn’t approved by DC.

        I’m no genius, but I could write a little script to strip out a bit of text from some emails with a few dozen lines of code, regex, and an hour, but this chucklefuck goes on plebbit of all places to ask how to alter Hillary Goddamn Clinton’s classified email records.
The incompetence is mind-blowing.

        In a way it does make sense that this guy was picked to set up the email server. A truly smart IT guy would have made regular backups of the underlying db in a location he controlled. Hillary wanted someone just smart enough to get things set up, but not smart enough to think for himself.

        In my view, one of the most fun things about the Clintons is that they hired people not for competence, but for loyalty to the Clintons, do or die loyalty. So they got incompetent help, which ensured that all their bullshit antics would sooner or later see the light of day. It was extremely appalling to watch them do their criminal bit in the 90s, and it seems their MO is still how they function–bumbling, incompetent, unprofessional crooks who get caught every time, but are allowed to skate. It’s the “allowed to skate” problem that needs to be fixed and pronto.

                You got it! I wrote political satire about the Clintons back in the 90s including one called something like “Apparent Suicide Syndrome (ASS).” At least it made me laugh.

            You’re 100% correct. Politicians hire for loyalty, not brains. Brains usually have some ethics or a sense of self-preservation, which will be bad for the politician.

        The really sad and very frightening thing about all of the crimes Hillary has committed is the total and complete indifference of her supporters to her criminal actions. They really are true believers.On CNBC recently, the former US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson reiterated his support for the criminal Hillary. This is really un-F’n believable.And also on CNBC recently, the BILLIONAIRE, and famous short seller, Jim Chanos (who runs Kynikos Assoc.) mentioned he will be voting for Hillary.Supposedly, these really smart folks should know better.One and only conclude, as did Woodrow Wilson, that the US Constitution must be eviscerated and replaced by the rule of, by and for the wealthy elites.And if the top dog elite, say Hillary, is a proven criminal, well, no big deal.If Hillary is elected, I sincerely hope that several US States band together and begin proceedings to amend the Constitution and strip the vast majority of powers from the Federal Rogue govt. and return them (as originally intended) back to the states.And if this does not work, then the states must begin proceedings to to secede from our former Constitutional Republic.Our Federal Govt. is already a rogue government and the congress long ago abrogated its constitutional responsibilities. Let’s not even mention the joke that is the supreme court.

        “What’s astonishing to me is the fact Team Cankles hired the dumbest IT people they could find.”
No, this is not astonishing, this is politics. Politicians hire staffers and help for loyalty, not brains. Believe me, I know, having consulted to government offices. Politicians believe loyalty protects them from their less-than-honest actions, but it results in people whose technical acumen makes them say their computer is broken when it’s actually turned off. Seriously. Three times in one day.
