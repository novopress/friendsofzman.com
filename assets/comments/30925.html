        What you see in Palestine is old school patriarchal virtue. The West is matriarchal now and women don’t want to accomplish virtuous deeds to be considered virtuous. Thus, the virus signaling about the current thing on social media. In Israel and Palestine leaders have to do more than tweet that they are mad.
This is why the cabal of female leftist legislators never need to even vote against the War Machine or the other neocon aspects of the Biden administration. All they need to do is tweet and post to be revolutionaries

        Great post. Don’t comment much here, or elsewhere, anymore. But still enjoy a good post like today’s. The answer to the last question in the OP is emphatically yes! We need to become tribal and forget abstract “objective” values that are repeatedly weaponized against us. Or we won’t survive.
Hope all the regulars here are doing well.

        Noteworthy here is how a high IQ population can still be utterly incompatible with Western civilization.  All of these Jews chirping on twitter have advanced degrees and supposedly have been fully exposed to Western ethical concepts, yet one little bop on the nose and they’re acting, in unison, just as bloodthirsty as the people they’re accusing of being animals and savages.Comparatively here after 9/11 the “let’s nuke them ay-rabs” opinion among the gentile population was generally limited to the truck nutz aficionado crowd.  For Europeans low empathy correlates strongly with low IQ, but that doesn’t seem to be the case for everyone else and is likely to be our undoing in the end.  The only last laugh we’ll have as whites will be the misery of the brown and yellow swarm of humanity endlessly butchering one another until the resources are all expended and their brutality can only be checked by being limited to sticks and rocks.

        More and more, the most likely probability is Jews let Happen On Purpose, and perhaps even helped it along.  Going back over the years, many will have heard the stories of IDF snipers shooting through the fence to takeout Pali Children who got too close to the fence. And now by surprise a horde rips a hole in the fence. Nah.
Netanyahu can’t really even hide his glee.  He and they can book a win of many fronts.

            The Iron Dome just happened to be turned off. They expect me to believe that?
But we’re at the point where even if the prime minister had sent the entire military on vacation a couple days prior, you’d be labeled a ‘conspiracy theorist’ if you questioned why

                Congressman Michael McCaul chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
McCaul asserts:
“We know that Egypt has warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” Mr McCaul told reporters following a closed-door intelligence briefing on Wednesday for lawmakers about the Middle East crisis, according to AFP news agency.
“I don’t want to get too much into classified, but a warning was given,” the Texas Republican added. “I think the question was at what level.”
Three days would seem to provide the special people sufficient time to turn off the Iron Dome.

                Probably the Iron Dome was never that good anyway. It had problems against even the 1st gen stuff Hezbollah was throwing at it and it being overwhelmed was to be expected. But if turned off, then yeah someone let it happen. Cui bono, the hardliners have the most to benefit. They get rid of Gaza and then start on the West Bank and Lebanon. Empires don’t build themselves after all.

            The 101st Airborne Division is being moved from Eastern Europe to Jordan.    So I guess Putin’s plan to overrun  Poland and the Baltics and wind up drinking  Vodka in Paris, as CNN has warned us,  were put on hold?
Or maybe the HOA reps showed up and told everyone they had to take down their Ukraine decorations as it is now Israel season?

                The 101st… somehow that rings a bell. That would be the same unit that was deployed to desegregate Little Rock High School in 1957 with bayonets fixed… right?

        There really is no such thing as a “tribal” person. There is no such thing as “tribal” justice. The term ‘justice’ does not take a modifier. One can, of course, invent meaningless combinations of words and speak about them, but that does not mean that they refer to anything in the real world.On the subject of “tribal” peoples, the Dissident online community says a lot of nonsense that doesn’t bear up under scrutiny (not even their own scrutiny), but they go on repeating it because it derives from their underlying worldview that they wish not to examine or change. Take, for instance, the oft-asserted claim that white people are “individualist, universalist, and high-trust” while black people are “tribal.”When you further enquire into what is meant by “tribal” here, the answer comes back that black people will always side with their own race and have no regard for those “white, universalist” concepts of right and wrong. After this, the Dissidents split into camps, divided over whether whites should isolate themselves to protect their vulnerable, high-trust societies or should adopt the behavior of the other races so as to defend the white tribe. When an added infatuation with HBD conduces them to the belief that all these behaviors are genetic and basically unalterable, it would seem to leave Dissidents at an impasse.However, the fundamental assumption here is wrong. Are blacks really “tribal”? Do they really side with their own race as a matter of default? Well, no, obviously not. How many blacks are killed by other blacks in the ghetto? Quite a lot. How many blacks are killed by other blacks in Africa. An astonishing number. This idea that black ethics is hardwired to preserve the members of the tribe has no basis in reality.What really happens is that blacksin Americaperceive themselves as a subordinate but free and entitled minority, rather like children. They tend to be somewhat “groupy,” but only in the manner that a bunch of school children playing hooky get groupy when they’re hiding under the bleachers and they hear the principal coming. Then they huddle together and giggle and flatter themselves that they’re really pulling one over on “the man.” If they have the chance to grandstand and defend one of their own in public, knowing that the possibility of reprisal is low and that the psychological rewards are high, of course they’re going to do it; but f you bring some real heat down on them, such that they will suffer personal consequences for goofing off, they are quick to throw each other under the bus as busted children do.The whole idea of black tribalism is really just black people playing the game that our system incentivizes them to play. But who built the system? It certainly wasn’t the black people. It was the white people. And the white people’ system is not “universalist,” it exists mainly so that upper class whites can persecute and exploit the lower class whites, with the black people thrown into the mix as irregulars.If it weren’t for the existence of this system, there would be no black “tribalism,” and the same could be said for all the other tribal minority groups in the West. All people, including whites, will behave this way under certain circumstances. But the Dissident program that exhorts whites to adopt “tribalism” as theself-consciously chosenpolitical platform ignores the fact that no people anywhere have ever done that, and the reason they haven’t done that is because it’s impossible. It simply is not within the purview of politics to do that, because that is disharmonious with the nature of reality and it is not anything truly desired. It equates to no real human good, so no one will ever spend any effort pursuing it. It is pure positivism—a worse example by far than any of the “universalist” ethics the Dissidents claim to oppose.The nearest thing that exists to a deliberately tribal organization would be something like a labor union, where the representatives defend anybody covered by the contract, come what may. But even then it is thecontractthat is defended, not the mere person, so it is not possible to get away from the concept of an impersonal law.

            A white OJ doing what he did with a white jury would have been convicted and removed him from society, forever.  Tribal blacks chose to ignore the overwhelming evidence in the case because he was being prosecuted by whitey for killing someone out of their tribe.   Marcia Clark was an idiot and she seriously thought that the sisterhood trumped race and that black women were going to be sympathetic to and relate to Nicole as a female instead siding with their race.There are numerous lesser known examples of tribal justice.  Ethan Limming recently is a good example.The more I type this the more I think that I am stating the obvious.   If you don’t know or believe this by now then probably you never will.

Not enough, is the glib answer, zero is the correct one.I quit reading at that point and no longer will bother with wasting eyesight even that long.

                    I have to take umbrage with being called disingenuous and dishonest. That is not true. If I said anything not factually accurate, I’m sure you could point it out.My brief here is that fact that the Dissident worldview, as articulated on its better-known blogs, is not reality. It is actually a genuine example of clinical hysteria, i.e. a womanish overreaction to unimportant details that have been imbued with an excess of symbolic weight. The reason is because the whole thing was developed by narrow-minded materialist dweebs who were infatuated with HBD and everything about Dissidentism has been saturated with it ever since. That’s not something that you can build a coherent philosophy out of. The movement would have been much better off if Steve Sailer had never existed.It’s not as if these things are difficult to prove. For instance, the often-made claim that white people are genetically trusting, altruistic, and universalistic in behavior can only be maintained by sweepingly disregarding century after century of bloody internecine warfare in Europe. Machiavelli’s Florence, the Thirty Years’ War, the Napoleonic era—all the work high-trust grillers?Clearly something is very amiss with this worldview, and that something is HBD. In its attempt to sacralize racial differences, the Dissident Right has destroyed intellectual integrity. That’s what needs to stop.

                        The explanation for white altruism was that during the last few centuries white criminals were drawn and quartered for stealing bread, thus producing selection pressure against antisocial behavior.  Claiming whites are just like jungle bunnies because the Vikings were all about thug life is ridiculous.

ID, do you believe that every IQ test that has ever been developed, even those that use images instead of words, demonstrate that blacks have an IQ that is one SD below whites?

I didn’t say that race doesn’t exist, I said that race doesn’t suffice as a national ideal. This is why an explicitly white ethno-state is impossible. However, a predominantly white nation protected byjus sanguinisis entirely possible, but it needs to be founded on something other than mere whiteness.White Nationalists talk as if they could just set up a “voluntary Switzerland ” somewhere and have at it, not realizing that this whole notion is just as fantastical as the project to set up a liberal democracy in Iraq. It doesn’t work that way. Real nations are the products of history, not the conscious creations of ideologues. The one nation on Earth that closely matches what the WNs want to achieve (i.e. Israel) is an unstable mess despite being grafted onto a very ancient people and enjoying the protection of the empire, and no WN state would have even that much.Artificial statelets and imperial dependencies aren’t the answer. The answer is in defeating the oligarchy.

You are not loquacious, not in a good way. Overly wordy, pedantic, and just come off as someone that has never set foot off a college campus and in the real world.
Either a neckbeard professor who sequesters on campus or a ‘professional student’. Either way, its a bad look and you just sound smarmy, out of touch, and sheltered. I was going to use the C word but I’ve used it on you once before. I’m feeling magnanimous today so I’ll give you a pass.

        In the past few years in Canada we have had:
– Iranian “Women, Life, Freedom” protests– Ukraine protests (no Russian protests allowed)– Sikh / Khalistan protests– Dueling Israeli / Palestinian protests
Time to send all these super patriots back to their homelands so they can carry on the good fight where it matters. Of course that will never happen.
Our people simply need to rediscover group identity. Treat your own people with those beautiful white values. Treat the rest with indifference because they are not us and will take advantage of our nice values.

                    Every “protest” is the government chanting encouragement to itself.
If your demonstration isn’t a *punished* crime, you’re a fed—of the soul if not the badge.
“Both sides” of Israel/Palestine can march in the West because our governments support them both.

        Even a worm will turn eventually. The frustration of the people inside the “world’s largest concentration camp” eventually broke out and they spent their military capital (what little they had of it) in an act of savage violence against their oppressors. What else could they do? Now the Jews are all outraged against the inevitable consequence of their own barbarity and indifference. You reap what you sow. But the Jews won’t stop. I suspect we’re in for Hollywood to jump into the fray on cue with some “high-production values” atrocity porn if they haven’t already (beheaded babies?)

            Tom K: “Now the Jews are all outraged against the inevitable consequence of their own barbarity and indifference.”Thinking back on what I used to see of j00ish p0rnography, many many moons ago, rather than barbarity &amp; indifference, I think I would be analyzing it more at outright sadism [plus psychopathy, of course].We misunderestimate j00ish sadism at our peril.They say you get the very best adrenochrome from torturing to death the little virgin shegetz, before you drain him.And that’s certainly how the kosher meat-packing industry operates.Torture the Lamb, in a vat of boiling urine &amp; excrement, for all eternity…

            “I suspect we’re in for Hollywood to jump into the fray on cue with some “high-production values” atrocity porn if they haven’t already (beheaded babies?)”I don’t know the truth of these claims—and neither does anyone else—certainly not the talking heads MSM and their Hebrew accomplices. Slaughtering the innocent is a time honored trigger in the Western world, especially in the Christian Era.  What I do know is that such a ploy(?) to ignite disgust, hatred, and retribution has been used quite recently and in the same regional area.Remember the first Gulf War.  I do.  In that case, we were treated—courtesy of the MSM—to Congressional hearings where a young Kuwaiti girl testified as to witnessing the Iraqi occupation soldiers enter her hospital maternity ward and throw babies (to the floor) from their incubators and then pack up the equipment for shipment back to Iraq.Baby killers all, we were told.  Evil incarnate. In the audience was the Kuwait ambassador.  Cameras panned to him and his tears and disgust at the gruesome “revelation”, of this innocent girl.  The media cried *atrocity*, the public cried “revenge”, and Bush the first cried “this shall not stand”.What was never revealed at that time was that this young girl was the daughter of that Kuwaiti ambassador seen weeping in the audience and further, it was never proven that she had even been in Kuwait during the invasion—having lived with her father in the Washington Kuwaiti embassy during the invasion.As has been said time and again here and touched upon today once more by Z-man—don’t let your virtues be used against you by your enemies.  Those who would draw us into war on another’s behalf are doing just that.

            I don’t know if the “beheaded babies” thing is true or not. Maybe it is. But I do know that in 1917, the “Huns” were accused of bayonetting babies, and that was false. In 1991, the Iraqi army was accused of murdering babies in incubators, and that was false.
So until I get more information I will remain skeptical that this is war propaganda intended to incite the goyim to support Israel.

                To be skeptical of atrocity claims is not to support “Muzzies”, but rather to support the truth.  Those who would lie to you wrt such events are *not* your friend—even though you both seemingly have the same enemy—but rather *your* enemy who wishes to deceive you into rash action which will be ultimately to his, rather than your benefit.I personally don’t want these folk (Muzzies) anywhere near me or living in my country (they have their own), but after a lifetime of seeing “war frenzy” whipped up generate popular support for elitist interests, I’m fairly retrospect when I see a repeat of this tactic.

                “Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.”
1 Samuel 15:3
The Muzzies aren’t the only “barbaric savages” out there whose religion tells them to kill anyone who disagrees… if you hold that “the earth has no place for such vermin” then you must logically agree that it has no place for a certain Semitic tribe, either.

        These days it seems the “highest” form of virtue that matters anymore is kissing black, tranny, jewish, illegal alien and gay ass – furthermore, the greatest exercise of justice is making sure White people get none, regardless of their virtue…

        The problem with the Middle East is the same reason that southern Italy could never develop no matter how many autostradas were paved and power lines hung.  The concept of “il vendetta.”   Nothing big can be built without drawing a thick black line and moving forward.Historically the only way this could be done was the total obliteration of your enemy.   In Christianity the concept of “forgiveness” is front and center.   The fact that the modern Christian since the 2nd “great awakening” has expanded the concept of forgiveness into a pacifist death cult is a Christian problem not a non-Christian one.  Even a Buddhist will lay down the law when his community is at stake.The only way to save Christianity is to obliterate it in its current form and have it germinate once again in a pre-great awakening form.   Both Jewish and Arab people could only achieve anything  while operating within the Christian superstructure of western civilization which is meeting its end.      Without it they would only kill each other anyway, because that’s the kind of people they are.

            A population with a Bronze Age mindset will eventually end up with Bronze Age living conditions. Things that are not maintained can fall apart surprisingly fast and the West is rapidly losing the human capital capable of keeping the lights on and the toilets flushing. The fact that we even know that anything happened in Israeli is because of technological advances in telecommunications by Western civilization,   a civilization which appears to be in terminal decline.  We may soon be entering a World without Whiteys creature comforts.

        “The sanctions regime was specifically aimed at the Russian people. The hope was that sanctions would collapse the economy and throw the population into starvation.”The theoretical way sanctions regimes are supposed to work is to punish the population in the target country until they rise of and throw off their leaders who we don’t like.  Aside the fact that this almost never works, they will often say this in the same paragraph as they are calling the leader a “brutal dictator.”  Civilian uprisings almost always end in lots of dead bodies in the streets.  Mao even invited criticism from “the people” and then promptly killed or imprisoned anyone who accepted the invitation.The only places this could theoretically work is in a liberal democracy. But liberal democracies are so drenched in propaganda and lies that the people wouldn’t even know why they were suffering. If they did figure it out, the target leaders would fill their society with propaganda explaining the country targeting them is run by Hitler and that we are the ones upholding freedom while modern-day Hitler wants to enslave them.

Recently listened to a US Naval War college professor address this:
Basic argument is that they don’t work in the short term, but over decades they utterly destroy countries that are enemies of the US.
Not sure how true that is, but it’s pretty f-ing evil

                Seems like it might have worked in Venezuela and Cuba. Sort of. In Iran, not so much. But in all cases, the regime lives on. Off the top of my head, I’m not coming up with a single case where it has succeeded in toppling a regime. Unless it was some African shithole where they topple every Thursday anyway.

            We have gotten glimpses of how D.C. works with the massive corruption of the Bidens, and they are not an outlier. Sanction evasion is quite lucrative, too, and at one point the same Special People could get their beaks wet by shrewd investments and insider tips about which companies could profitably evade the same sanctions imposed to protect Our Democracy. The smarter of the two savage Bronze Age Death Cults currently killing babies excelled at sanction evasions, by the way.This may no longer work because the loss of trust is shared by those at the top. Along the lines of today’s topic, in times past the intelligence services would have greenlighted either MI6 or Mossad to do a false flag in the interior of the United States to rile up the rubes. That probably is far harder when (a) people already are furious at D.C. about an open border that in fact could facilitate actual terrorism, (b) a false flag might prompt off-kilter folks to follow suit with real ones, and (c) sketchy minorities are found throughout the apparat–even WASPy former CIA director is reputed to have converted to Islam and might tip off his pals in Tehran.They have sewn the wind…

        I always knew he was a kahanist type but it’s good to see guys like Josh hammer drop the facade that he is a foreign policy realist. He had been expressing skepticism towards Ukraine but he seems all in on this conflict. Perhaps he’s a different flavor of neocon. The antijihad/Pamela geller types were one flavor of neocon more concerned with Israel. The kristol/kagan/nuland types were more concerned with eastern Europe.Also, it’s annoying to see rw Jews on Twitter all of a sudden trying out the al and Jesse playbook. If you look at hammers Twitter it’s only slightly different than some black activist calling everyone racist. The only difference is instead of racist he’s saying “Jew hater” or “Nazi”

        “Our sense of virtue in the West is a very republican one in that it is based on your relationship with the social systems, not how you serve your family, your community, or your people.”This is actually an inversion of right and wrong.  Think about all the people mobbed and hated because they said the wrong word or words around an African or LGBTQIPA+ person.  Everything about them is ignored and they are pilloried and made into a bad example of how evil people live.  Think about the “Karen” meme of failing to show enough deference to an African in their presence.  Even a Jewish lawyer had his life destroyed and was evicted from his office building for daring to say people in America should speak English.Now, even traditional “justice” takes a back seat to the injustice of republican virtue. They won’t send thieves, druggies, or many violent offenders to prison in the pursuit of social justice.  My city has a top prosecutor (Larry Krasner) who believe justice is racism and drops the cases of most arrestees. Now the bail reform movement making its way across America is assuring most criminals are let out of jail immediately after an arrest in the rare instances where the case is not outright dismissed.

            Attorneys are well aware that breaking the law is not necessarily unjust, and indeed may be the most just thing…There are two categories of laws…malum in se (punishing what’s immoral by societal standards), and malum prohibitum, which is everything else, including millions of regulations…Juries have traditionally recognized that killing can be moral and just in some circumstances, and that goes back to ancient Anglo-Saxon customs and law..Jefferson, Thoreau and others have said that violating an unjust law is not only acceptable, but required….

                The prohibition against mugging old ladies is not an unjust one.  These are the kinds of crimes where the law will not be enforced.Much of the lax law enforcement is malicious and selective and based on the race of the victim and perpetrator.  The 3 blacks who kidnapped and tortured a retarded White kid and who live-streamed it while in constant state of laughing were handled with kid gloves and given probation. This kind of thing goes on all over the US now.This occurs both in and out of court. Kevin Cooper, who put an axe into 3 children’s heads plus 2 adults gets puff pieces about him in the NYT and mini documentaries about how he dindu nuffin and it was 3 mysterious White guys.  Plus hit pieces on White men who are initially determined to have acted in self defense by police like  Michael Drejka and the McMichaels in order to get them charged.  Then there is the straight up politically motivated malicious prosecution of people like Kyle Rittenhouse.These are all big crimes. But there a ton of lesser crimes that are selectively not enforced which destroys communities and quality of life.

I had a friend who was 17 and dating a 14 year old unknown to him. Even her mother lied to him and said she was 16. Fortunately, nothing came of it, but it could have.

                        Yep, such was occurring in my university during the later days of the Feminism scourge.  Co-Ed’s could file an “evidence-free” rape accusation to the Dean of Students and instantly you became an “alumni”.  If a horny guy “pumped and dumped” a female classmate he was playing with fire if she sought revenge through the administration.

                Hm. This is really quite murky. Southern negroes in the so-called “civil rights movement” violated “unjust” laws as a matter of course. We now see that not only were those laws not unjust, they were necessary for the maintenance of civilization.

        The logical endpoint of the “Our Democracy” dialectic in the US can be found in the Iraqi elections.These are really censuses, not elections. The Shiites wave their purple fingers and ululate for the Shiite candidate and the Sunnis scream for their guy. So the balance of power really comes down to how many militia each side can field and how well they manipulate foreign governments and NGOs ($$).Since the writ of the government doesn’t extend outside Baghdad and the influence of foreigners ends at the Green Zone barricade, we are left with tribal mini-states running the show. (Lebanon is the same).This is probably our future.

        A million years ago Pat Buchanan rightly pointed out that there was a difference between a concentration camp and a deathcamp. A concentration camp was like Andersonville, a place where prisoners were concentrated, with the death (supposedly) stemming from a lack of resources rather than actual intent. The intent of a deathcamp wasn’t the concentration, but the death. The slimeball Bill Kristol used this to claim Buchanan was a “Holocaust denier” (“He said there were no concentration camps!”) and the rest is history.Gaza is five miles wide by twenty-five miles long, with something like two million people living there, one of the highest concentrations of people on Earth. They have a better TFR than the Israelis and about half their population is children. I frankly have no dog in a fight between unibrows and hook noses, but Western morality is very much—as Helen Lovejoy knows—a matter of “thinking of the children!” A few children getting killed by a kid zonked out on psychotropic drugs whose parents didn’t keep the guns locked up is grounds to take away your rights. Cutting off food (and probably water) to about a million little brown kids may or may not backfire, in terms gaining international support. Most Americans are zombies and will think or not think whatever they’re told to think. And while your TV and mailbox will always be bombarded with pictures of starving children, our media is good at hiding this stuff simply by ignoring it. Google “Palestinian Mummy Zoo” and think about how much we would have heard about this if it happened somewhere else, say, South Africa in the 80s.My guess is that what we call the Left has given too much power to brown and black members of their coalition for support for Israel to continue reflexively. People like Ilhan Omar are stupid, but stupid is very much the future in America—even among airline pilots and congress critters. The crafty old neocons are ageing off, and their replacements are as gormless as the younger human capital everywhere else.  Black people dislike Jews, remembering their exploitation at their hands in everything from entertainment to the local landlord and pawnshop owner in the ghetto.Again, I don’t care about Israel or Palestine. I care about preserving enough of America so that whatever comes next doesn’t end up being like that. It could happen very fast—i.e. “The Six Days’ War”—with our fate being decided very quickly. I won’t posit a Harold Covington/Turner Diaries scenario, but if we’re not careful, and smart—and tribal—we could end up like the Afrikaners, or the Palestinians. Or those animals in the Palestinian zoo

            Great stuff Joey.I have told my Jewish friends (some are pretty based actually, or as based as rich Jewish guys can be) that the Liberal Jews have really screwed the pooch pushing for all the “diversity”. My argument to them is that the elite WASPs of yore may have had contempt for them, but the Jews managed to get very rich and were very safe with the WASPs in charge.But because they think they can always improve things, they have displaced the old WASPs with this coalition of anti-White knuckleheads. They wanted to be in charge so they could impose their “virtue” and “justice”. But this coalition actually hates them and all Whites too. They won’t be able to control it, as we now see. They will be dreaming of the good old days of benign contempt and getting black-balled at country clubs. There will be no virtue nor much justice.

                This.  American Jews should have been pro Traditional America all along.  So what if wasps blackballed them from a country club, they were safe and could prosper and contribute.  Wasps created a basically honest and decent society, as far as they go. It was a wasp American Army that fought the Nazis.  American Jews are NOT safe with these low IQ POC knuckleheads who lie as a matter of culture and are one chimp-out away from literal throat slitting.Also, there is no reason for Dissident Right to be pro-Palestinian or pro-Hamas.  No different than being pro BLM or La Raza or whatever savage group du jour making demands on your money  and you life.Not to say you should be pro Israel or Jews, but certainly not pro Palestinian.

                Now that the WASP has fallen, in the Anglosphere distinctions of rank between the Germanic/Anglo/etc. (white) and the Ashkenazi (optionally white) are drawn by Jews. Unlike white Christians, blacks don’t reflexively obey them.No black man who’s not an antisemite even knows what a Jew is. He trusts his predatory eye when picking out homos to sucker-punch, grannies to rob, and politicians to riot against.Netanyahu is wise enough to reject African immigrants because he knows his people can’t rule them. Our local Jews can’t see past their erection at the thought of our extinction—which is also theirs. Their “politics” is autoerotic asphyxiation.

            The enduring advantage, maybe the only advantage, that we have over the Afrikaners, and the Palestinians, is that there are just way too many of us. This vexes Them to no end. And this advantage will persist long after we have become a minority/plurality. Moreover, their plates couldn’t keep spinning without us. We can only hope they institute an apartheid.

            I saw a video on Saturday or Sunday that was supposed to be Israelis dumping cement into a well. Given the prevalence of propaganda on the internet, it might be old video or not a well, but it does match the rhetoric which is a total blockade including food, water and medicine.  The bloodlust on social media is indicative of the deep seated hatred all sides have.To me, it’s just more proof, as if it were needed, that diversity plus proximity equals war.  I just wish the promise of social media, which was that we could see videos of the  chaos was real. Any video with anything good in it gets taken down within seconds.

        Great post, Z.A friend of mine is a real estate agent in Northern VA. She told me that a few years ago, a dot Indian colleague of hers who shares a large office space was working with a Guatemalan client/home buyer. The Amerindian decided to back out of the home purchase after placing earnest money but he reneged within the time frame and was due his earnest money. The details were explained to him including the fact that there is a process involved. That afternoon, the Amerindian showed up at their office and refused to leave until he received his money. He was furious and law enforcement had to be called. He was certain the Indian guy had stolen his money and he’d never receive it.After the incident, the American/white agents realized how shocked and rattled they had been as opposed to the south Asians , etc in the office who were largely unaffected. It was attributed to America being a ‘land of law and order’. They failed to take it any further to face the real issue. These types of interactions are commonplace in South Asian and Central American countries due to the corruption because of the demographics in those countries. Whites are accustomed to high trust because whites are altruistic and honest.Now we are experiencing a clash of tribes from these low trust, dangerous societies in our own communities.Freedom of association could not be more important for whites.

        “…a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.”Why, you’d almost think President Washington was talking about our relationship with Israel…

            It makes you wonder, in the face of the present blistering criticism of America as a bunch of Enlightenment hokum. Not that the criticism is without merit, yet clearly there was the idea of America as a new nation that had to be protected and strengthened, as opposed to the largest social experiment yet undertaken. Back and forth for a quarter millennium, or so. I wish we would decide what we are, already!

        The clash of these two views of justice in the US (possibly also Europe) implies the extinction of those that continue to hold the Western way of justice in the face of the tribal way. As each member of our tribe is killed or imprisoned by the institutions captured by the enemy, we sit back and rely on that captured system. Adapt or perish as a people.

            As I was getting at below, this demand for tribal loyalty is potentially very damaging to a coalition that is built on multiple tribes. A mix of blacks, arabs, shitlib whites, jews, and hispanics does not make for an enduring political union that can stand the test of time.

                    “ Ideally, the only hostile tribes will be kept without our borders. ”
I’m thinking it can be done—and is done in many countries.  I note how certain ethnically whole countries on occasion issue VISA’s for residency and nothing else—no right to vote, no path to citizenship, renewal every 6-12 months.  In some case even having to go back to home country to reapply.
Not quite what you desire, but it can be done.

            Quite. In fact, one could easily argue that the trible norms, the laws of the jungle, are being worked against whites who fecklessly attempt to defend themselves with rapidly attenuating universalist systems of virtue and justice. Call it the Boomer Boomerang.

        Does anybody else miss the Cold War?Say what you will about the times, and about Soviet Communism, but it seemed for forty years as if the world operated under a set of predictable, understandable, relatively civilized rules. Everyone knew where the line was: you stay on your side of the Berlin Wall; we stay on our side. As long as nobody sends their tanks across the border, all of us get to go about our business normally. Khrushchev was blustery, but not a madman (“We will bury you” was actually better translated as “We will outlast you”). Brezhnev just wanted his afternoon tea and to sign off on awarding himself another medal.We didn’t know how good we had it.

            This is a point Dugin has made often. The collapse of the Soviet Union was not just a catastrophe for Russia, but for the world. I do not agree entirely with this, but in the fullness of time we may look at the end of the Cold War as a catastrophe for the West.

                Z – the end of the Cold War being a catastrophe is even more pronounced as it can argued that the West LOST the war.  The USSR may have collapsed but it’s main export to the world (Communism, Socialism) spread throughout Western Europe and the Anglosphere.  The Soviets lost their country but won the world.

They just emphasize different aspects of human affairs to liberate.  The largest differences between the American and the Russia systems were the result of vastly different cultures and histories.   Both could be capitalist or communist and have vastly different ways of living and governments.Beyond that,  Schumpeter predicted  70 years ago that capitalism would inevitably transform into socialism as the children of capitalists became soft  and took the gains of their ancestors for granted.   Which is what we are living through today.

                Gorbachev and the others at the top of the Kremlin saw how China transformed its economy by ditching hard-core communism and advancing some freedoms, producing tremendous economic growth and restoring Chinese greatness. They tried to do the same, but it didn’t work the same way. Part of the problem was China followed a gradual approach of first freeing the local economies, especially agriculture, while only gradually freeing large industries, mostly maintaining state control. By contrast, Russia listened to Western economists and imposed “shock therapy,” letting the infamous oligarchs loot heavy industry, especially commodities, until Putin came in and killed, exiled or controlled the oligarchs. And of course, the West lied when it said NATO would not move “one inch to the East.” As recently as Feb. 21, 2022, some Russians still were trusting the West. Now they know better. The Cold War had to end, but the sequel could have been so much better. Despite all that, the odds of Russia surviving until 2123 are better than for America.

                We may look at it as an opportunity squandered by triumphalist, vengeful neocons who saw the end of the Cold War not as a telos but as a staging ground to subject the entire planet to liberal democracy under the misbegotten aegis of universalism.

                    Not so much liberal democracy, but neoliberalism, aspiring to transcend the nation state. But neoliberalism became neocolonialism, almost inevitably given its foundational beliefs and tenets. So, send in the economic hitmen to preserve the desired end state of master and peon.

            Correct.So it goes with all this semitic shite. Any number of Christians are now standing up on their hind feet and proclaiming that jews are God’s chosen people. Hell’s bells – have any of those retards even READ the bible? The old testament is ALL about how God punished those idiots, and how they never learned anything!  My personal opinion is that whole mess is up to God to sort out, because if we get involved with them, He will judge us when next he judges them. This kind of crap will drive schisms in all camps – not only the Christians and the Dissidents.In the secular world, I think this is going to be the exit strategy of Globohomo from the Ukraine debacle.  “Look, all ye rubes and peons! There is another Current Thing that DEMANDS your full attention!!!” And magically – the Ukes disappear from thought, the Russians, and any number of other monsters the left has created.Contrary to our esteemed blog host, nothing need end badly! All ya need is a big enough diversion – and it’s all good!!!Ima gonna sit this one out in the outhouse and mind my own business. Not like anyone will pay any attention to an old stubfart when they are blithely ignoring the scholars and common sense.

            Remember in the Philippines when they tried to kick the U.S. Military out of the Islands?  Well SOB, Al Qaeda  showed up out of the blue and took over a whole city.   Hate it when that happens.  Then of course the U.S. had to stay to “help” the Philippines.Look at this from 30,000 ft and what has happened?   Bibi was saved from impeachment at the very least.  Maybe worse.   The neocons are well on their way to their long standing dream of War with Iran.   The U.S. Government has, for the moment at least, distracted the normies from the invasion of our country and all of the other massive insolvable problems created by the government for the past 40 years.Remember too that Hamas fought with ISIS for a time against Assad in Syria.   Funny that an organization so against the West  often seems to “accidentally”  play into the goals of the West does it not?No matter, the idiots will probably fall for it again and be stampeded to war.    This time though against Iran, the outcome may not be so predictable.   It may turn out to be the biggest military mistake since Hitler invaded Russia.Win lose or draw a campaign against Iran will probably be the Empires’ last hurrah.

                Bibi probably was a dancing Israeli when this happened because it will keep him in power and out of jail at least for a little while longer. Personal corruption isn’t a big deal when you have a country to save. A pox on all their houses as far as I’m concerned. I still haven’t forgotten that Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to congratulate Biden after the steal. Screw him especially.

            AoS has never pretended to be anything other than a pro-Israel front, so they reaction over there isn’t surprising.  But there are definitely some green shoots coming up in the normie-verse.  Take this video by Salty Cracker, titled “Israel claims Hamas killed and beheaded 40 babies.”  Two decades ago, this would have been a rage-filled attack on the Palestinians.  A decade ago, the same.  A half dozen years ago it probably followed the same script.  But in 2023, the video basically makes the point that we can’t believe what we’re told and even if it’s true, as horrible as it would be, it’s not our job to get involved.   On top of the matter that the West has been allowing these same sand joggers to flood our countries.Don’t underestimate how much the basic assumptions of normie-cons with regards to race, immigration, and the military have changed in such a short time.  There’s still lots of work to be done but there are areas in which to feel encouraged.https://rumble.com/v3oc2uk-israel-claims-hamas-killed-and-beheaded-40-babies.html

            A lot of the commenters and staff there share an affinity with Israel.One member of staff  who calls himself Charlie Brown’s Dildo constantly calls for Europe to be exterminated because they’re …socialists. Sure.Last year with the massive increase in heating costs he was salivating at the prospect of millions of Europeans freezing to death. The same person boasts about Judeo Christian virtues.They whine about woke and cancel culture but call for anti-semites  to be destroyed physically and/or economically. America is a proposition nation and white identity a betrayal of the shining city.An extremely unpleasant and priggish group.

        Being an impartial observer of the fracas in the Levant (that statement alone would get me ostracized as a heretic here in clown world), the main entertainment value for me is seeing the pro-palestinian “left” assailed by the pro-jew “left,” because this time around it probably has far reaching political implications. This time around, the Current Thing demands that you are either pro jew or you are a non person. They don’t have any room left for the pro palestinians. And they are going by the creed that “silence is violence,” which mostly came from the pro Pal/BLM left in the first place.This could be the beginning of a schism on the “left” that not much of anybody saw coming. It ostracizes and banishes not only the Tlaibs and Omars, but also potentially BLM and even The Precious himself.   Raising the question of whether or not it was orchestrated with that end in mind. Considering that the HRC wing has never been all that chummy with the Obama wing.

            In order to have a schism on the Left, the Left would have to have a consistent set of principles.  The difference between the pro-palestinians and the pro-jews is more like a ripple when you toss a rock into a pond.  Gone in a few seconds.

            All this. The political schism is particularly noticeable in the so-called “media.” Intelligence services mouthpiece CNN, littered with even former Mossad spooks, is grilling Freedom Bagels and is all-in on Israel 4-Ever. MSNBC/NBC, the mouthpiece of chi-chi radicalism, is grilling Freedom Kebabs and Stands with Palestine. I haven’t noticed either of their talking heads wearing Palestinian or Israeli flag pins on their lapels just yet, but the day is young. It may seem like hopium but the Coalition of the Fringes indeed is unraveling and erupting into a leftwing civil war. These will continue to happen.We must focus on our people and take advantage of withdrawing from the internecine squabbles among Not Our People, which will become more and more common as the Clown Show implodes. Not our monkeys, not our service, but our opportunity.

            Jeffrey Zoar:  First thing I noted as I started scanning headlines this morning.  The hedge fund managers and Wall Street bigwigs are all proclaiming a “no hire” policy for  the various Ivy League student associations who sided with the Palestinians.  And a sexually-confused BLM student leader had a job offer rescinded.  Meanwhile, the subcons are furiously trying to distance themselves from the blaqs and Arabs.  Everyone is busy scrubbing internet and social media pages.  Because everyone knows that if it’s not online it doesn’t exist.  Besides, they’ve been toppling statues and remaking movies and rewriting books for years now. Surely there’s no one left who ‘matters’ who remembers that boring old stuff.I find it absolutely hilarious.  The Jews have been funding every anti-White group and agitating for the destruction of heritage America for decades.  Suddenly their foot soldiers have all turned on them!  And it never occurred to the blaqs that they wouldn’t be hired as chief diversity officer, because they are innately convinced of their own brilliance.  Hey, what ever happened to the ‘arc of history’ eternally bending their way?The funniest bit is the subcons scrambling to disavow their earlier support for the other parts of the anti-White coalition.  They’ve suddenly realized that while Jews may pass as White when it suits them, they remain as tribal as any other on the left and that trying to play by anti-White rules in a tribal feud means the subcons lose.  They are working hard to challenge Jewish primacy in both economic and political arenas but they aren’t there yet, and fear they’ve showed their hand too soon.It’s a game of anti-White musical chairs where the participants are suddenly finding the rules changed mid-game.  Jewish or White?  Both? Neither?  Everyone is scrambling for a seat.  I hope they all fall on their anti-White azzez.

                    JD, yessir.AND we move to help Our People while the desert people rage against each other. So many of Our People need help and guidance. It can be as tremendous as financially helping a young white family improve their condition or as easy as helping mentor  Our youth in an activity.The “Sorting” is good, AND we can do more than be passive observers to the latest shitshow.This isn’t directed at you Sir… you just got me thinking about how fed up I am with Our People being distracted by the “latest thing” as much as the Left. The Progs march in lockstep and change their profile image and we dutifully educate ourselves on every aspect of their latest craziness so we can better mock them and make logical arguments to them that they’ll never read.It’s a waste of time unless you are using it to educate yourself for better action in this fight for Our People. There are a million ways to be an active part. It doesn’t have to consume your life but it’s a far better use of our limited time here than figuring out which tribe that hates us we should side with.

                Have been wondering myself, why this Get Gaza stuff was catching with subcons this week. I’m from Socal and not a subcon but have noted once or twice their sensitivity to what is “low class” or not (and obviously, the slice of subcons over here is none too representative of the race generally). Pondered it earlier with the NYer mag expose of that Daily Show/Netflix comedical gentleman who is basically a woke opportunist, it turns out.With occasional interesting exceptions, they don’t typically buy the “solidarity” hype and instead to deploy it as part of a minmax strategy. A Muslim subcon rich kid wrote BLM x100 on his Stanford app, got accepted, though ultimately went to Halloween Costume U in Connecticut instead — now seems like quaint stuff from Victorian times, frankly.

        A complex and thought-provoking post today. Let’s try to parse some of it.“Hamas committed an atrocity against the Jews because their justice demanded it.”Their survival, not their justice. The Israelis want to exterminate them, do away with them as a house owner wants to do with rats in his abode. For the Israelis the Palestinians are untermensch. Israeli policy is slow suffocation, slow but sure extermination. In this they’re backed by US and European connivance and at times complicity. A nod and a wink, accompanied by some hypocritical words about peace settlement. By the same people who’ve been berating the poor Germans for the last eighty years. The Israelis are perpetrating the same crimes that some Nazis got the noose for at Nuremberg. The Hamas attack is one of defiance. A quick death rather than a slow one. They have to know they cannot prevail against the Israeli military machine. They have to have known from past experience that the Israeli response would be out of all proportion to their own attack.What Hamas attack also does is to highlight Western hypocrisy (as if it were needed). Yes, a lot of talk about virtue and justice. But the talk doesn’t translate into action when the chips are down. Every US politician — with perhaps two or three exceptions — is owned by AIPAC, the “Israel Lobby” as Walt and Mearsheimer name them. That includes not just the usual suspects but people like Trump, Robert Kennedy, Jr., and Ramaswamy. Their pricks are in Israel’s back pocket.At the moment the situation is that if Israel were to unleash a nuclear device in the occupied territories, the West would at most comment that “it was regrettable and unlikely to be conducive to establishing lasting peace.” The Israelis have carte blanche from the collective West,What’s happening in the Middle East is a race war pure and simple.

            The Irony–it burns.The Jews were driven out of the Pale of Settlement in Ukraine, then landed in Israel, and America, and prospered mightily while still holding fast to their ancient tenets. Now the worm has turned and they are repeating history trying to drive out Arabs.The question is, why do the Palestinian Arabs cling so stubbornly to their slivers of territory, when conceivably they must be as intelligent as the Jews, yet refuse to depart and prosper elsewhere taking their ancient tenets with them?And as an aside, once the dust has settled, will the same ME countries that provided training and intel to Hamas now welcome the departing Palestinians into their own countries with free land and housing, and if not, why not–they are all one people under Allah aren’t they?

                To me the situation is reminiscent — in a macabre way — to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. I suppose it’s a thought crime to even equate the two. That uprising also was doomed to failure.The Palestinians are no match for the Ashkenazi Jews in intelligence. The one thing I cannot say is that the Ashkenazis are stupid.For the Palestinians I suppose the question is that even if they could depart, why should they? It’s a matter of principle. Why should they be ousted from their homeland? The Jews have operated like the camel that pokes his cold nose into a tent and eventually takes over all of it.The relationship of Israel to the West is an interesting one, replete with ambiguity. The raison d’etre for Israel is as a homeland for Jews persecuted by Europeans. Yet they consider themselves attached by an umbilical cord to that very West. Maxime Rodinson — a French Jew — put it well when he described the Jewish settlers in Palestine as the lowest strata of European society — yet still belonging to that alien world (from his book, “Israel and the Arabs”). The cosmopolitan Jew — as homeless in the Middle East as  he was in Europe.

        It’s the fact that it’s not our business to be involved in that bothers me. Further, if Israel makes good on their threats and Americans cheer it, idk. The plague years took enough of a toll on me. After a point, it’s not worth defending one’s own.

        Speaking of Bronze Age Mindset at the end of this article, I would love a Z man review of BAM by BAP. I’m a big fan and I know a lot of my friends are as well. He seems pretty popular in the younger right wing sphere, and has minimal overlap with the fuentes groupies.
Has the Zman written about BAP at all before?

                It’s in-character comic philosophy layered over some traditional observations and advice you’re old enough to know (or reject) already. You’d probably be extremely annoyed by it.
Back in our day “pomo” fiction gradually developed a self-parodizing Nietzschean authorial voice—Mark Leyner perfected it—because that voice lets you say *anything*, fully sincerely and ironically at the same time.
It’s like that but not finely crafted.

                His ‘cave man’ act is just an act. You either get the humor or you don’t. He’s actually one of the smartest people on the right. His judgment in political matters is nearly perfect.Here’s an article where he lets the act drop somewhat. It’s about Ukraine but it could be about this new war as well:https://theamericansun.com/2022/07/29/bap-on-the-abuse-of-war/His PhD dissertation in political science from Yale is also good. You can get it on Amazon. Review that one instead. Search for ‘Selective Breeding and the Birth of Philosophy’. Too radical for most people but a very insightful book.People who think this guy is some kind of kosher psy-op are so delusional they’re not worth talking to. In fact it’s a good litmus test for spotting dumb people with poor judgement like Fuentes and his people.

            My $.02: That book has some interesting points to make about a mindset that is to be inculcated and explored. However, BAP has been identified and it looks like he is a subversive. Another usual suspect. He promotes and Andrew Tate type of philandery, degenerate lifestyle and has some very suspect mentors.Many on the DR who expressed caution about him and now they are looking prudent for doing so. If you want to follow our guys, follow:Tom Rowsell of Survive the JiveDries van Langenhove:(https://odysee.com/@Guben14:0/Dries-van-Langenhove-Speech-at-the-March-against-Marrakesh–English-Subtitles-:8https://odysee.com/@BelgianCongo:3/Dries-Van-Langenhove-restores-Congo-monument-dedicated-to-1894-war-against-Arab-Slavers:2The DistributistThe PrudentialistGeorge BagbyAuron MacIntyreJust to name a few. There are also significant IRL movements around these folks that promote constructive action and fellowship. Things like the Beowulf Foundation and more. Another nice thing about them is that they are younger than the more longstanding organizations. They also are wise in how they present.

Some of his stuff is humorous, and it seemed he had some good ideas.  Lifting weights is never bad.

            His book was okay. The only memorable passage for me is the one where he compares someone like Mitt Romney to an ancient alpha male. It’s a good thing to keep in mind, how effete and emasculated even our most “alpha” world rulers are. (For example, a typical Greek archon had seen more death, or slain more people, or had more wives and concubines, than even a modern Israeli ruler.)

            For what it’s worth, the TRS guys say that BAP has admitted that he is chosen.  I don’t trust the TRS guys not to exaggerate and because I’ve never found BAP compelling, I don’t care enough to check myself.
If BAP has the lineage that they claim, then this fact is significant because of the deep tribal loyalty that almost all of them feel.  If the claim is true, you cannot read BAP as a disinterested commenter about the conflict in the Levant.

        The book “Human Smoke” goes into great detail the effort the British put into starving and bombing civilian populations during WWII. It also goes into the massive propaganda campaign directed at the civilian population, including incarcerating a massive number of British citizens with no due process.On the U.S. side, you have Sherman terrorizing the South in the civil war and the ruthless elimination of the natives in the 1800’s.Whether you believe such tactics were necessary is beside the point. It shows that western ideas of justice and virtue can only rally exist in a peaceful time among a relatively peaceful people. People in the Middle East have never had either, which is why they are so comfortable with their more ancient versions of Justice.  Deep inside, when push comes to shove, most everyone is Bronze Age.

            There is something elegant and sort of satisfying in the thought of two chosen champions, or better yet, their leaders fighting it out man to man to determine which side wins a war. If wars necessitated that the President and Congress move their offices to within 10 miles of the battle front, we would soon find the cries for war and retribution muted. Even better, if we help Israel, all troops we send must be Jewish.

                I recently have seen high-lighted for the first-time reprinted stories/quotes about the Puritan intent to genocide Southerners along with reproduced photographs of how brutal and menacing the federal troops were during the Civil Rights era. Both are meant as warnings/terrorism and are the product of Semitic and Semitic-influenced mindsets. You once had to dig to find these stories and pictures, and I had forgotten how genocidal the language was toward even children.

            When push comes to shove, any country with a few nukes and the ability to deploy them would use them before defeat. That is a universal given, and mostly a universal deterrent to would be attackers.The logical conclusion from this is any country that hopes to avoid military conquest should be seeking nukes with all their power. It would probably be a more peaceful world if everybody had them instead of just a few, with the no doubt occasional localized exchange between the inevitable nuts of course.The problem soon however is the potential for biological warfare the likes of which have never been known and is quickly becoming accessible to those very same nuts. It is entirely conceivable that some small time player unleashes an attack with a 90% kill rate. It’s good night Irene at that point. Bronze age will look like the good old days.

            &gt;t shows that western ideas of justice and virtue can only rally exist in a peaceful time among a relatively peaceful people.
I might claim the opposite.  The modern/Western ‘total war’ seems to demand “unconditional surrender” of the enemy.  That goal, in turn, requires defeating the enemy’s will-to-fight, which in turn, justifies the slaughter of their women and children.
Put differently, the old “private wars” between monarchs arguably produced more humane results.

Tom Rowsell at Survive the Jive has the best and appropriate rebuttals. We are surrounded on all sides. Sorry for the off topic comment. Great post today. On positive identity, Rowsell’s channel is a must. He is still on YT for now. He was denied entry the the US recently. Please share with your friends and family.
