        They‚Äôre pushing Wuhan to make you believe there‚Äôs a ‚Äúvirus‚Äù.  It‚Äôs all about the jewjab.  There is no motherfucking virus.  But there is patent 060606 jewjab to take out  anyone stupid enough to  sign up for their own death.  So be it.  Let the heads roll.

        Cuomo lifting almost all restrictions in NY is a very good thing.
This is because it will act as a force multiplier that limits the NYC-based, juice-owned, Karen-staffed MSM‚Äôs ability to autistically screech about mass Beer Flu deaths the way they did to ramp up the hysteria.

        I think the issue is that having got rid of Trump, the world has not gone back to Bush-Obama. Everyone with a brain realizes the Chinese were weaponizing bat viruses to kill most of the rest of the world. That the Chinese Dream having a vastly increased living standard will require killing most of the rest of humanity and vastly impoverishing the rest, including elites. The Davos type Great Reset was supposed  to be an elite bargain between the West and China. And Xi wants it all.There will be all sorts of divisions and infighting in the Biden Regency. And many allied with China. But the great profits to be had there are winding down. If nothing else China is older and richer, and their pool of vast cheap labor and their rulers willingness to suffer brutal pollution is coming to an end. Xi only has prosperity and nationalism to offer. He literally has nothing else and has many angry enemies internally who were brutally suppressed or shorn of family dynastic possessions. Xi is likely the lynchpin, like Kaiser Wilhelm in 1914, of the coming storm.

            I‚Äôll admit I haven‚Äôt read the prolific Unz article. I‚Äôve always believed in the lab release, but I‚Äôm skeptical of deliberate intent, especially non-Chinese spooks. The core problem is that you are embellishing the story too much; each condition added reduces the probability it happened the way claimed.Like any good conspiracy theory, of course, it is impossible (for me at least) to prove or disprove. But I base my above conclusions on common sense and logic. Occam‚Äôs Razor is an excellent tool. It basically suggest you choose the simplest, most likely explanation, that fits all available facts.For example, if a person claims to have been kidnapped by a UFO and experimented upon, lacking any other evidence, there are really only two possibilities:(1) He really was abducted by unknown entities as he claims or(2) He is as crazy as an outhouse rat and thus any statements of his should be viewed with a bit of skepticism.Now, in the above case, wouldn‚Äôt you agree that (2) is the more likely explanation?Return now to the case of the pandemic. It is easily established that there is a Wuhan Institute of Virology, that it had large collection of bat viruses, perhaps the world‚Äôs largest. It also engaged in gain of function and other researches with these viruses, in part funded from U.S. Government funds. This lab (and several others) had long history of safety flaws, including escaped viral contamination (e.g. SARS). Much of this is openly published in the academic literature. Worldwide cover-up and disaster though it may be, when you have twenty years of published academic research and other unclassified sources, from all over the world, it‚Äôs very difficult to cover it up after the fact üòÄ

                    IMO, Chinese research establishment is still in thrall to to US research and mirrors and copies US research directions. Today, still, most top Chinese researchers have trained in western labs and have respect for western research. So when US pushed into gain of function research, China pays attention and mirrors us. In this case, all the stuff that the Wuhan lab worked on was being done by the Ralph Baric lab at UNC.So question then is why did we push into gain of function research? Infectious disease research was considered to be an unsexy and unprofitable arena within the larger bioscience world. If you want to know what is sexy in biosciences look at what makes money for the pharma industry: stuff that fights cancer, stuff that lowers cholesterol, stuff that gets a dick hard, etc. No one cares about malaria. So infectious disease researchers had to drum up a way to keep the funding flowing and perk up interest in their projects.Arguing that there was value in gain of function was how they did this. Its a way to drum up new research projects and directions for a field that is otherwise sleepy and unprofitable. Note that the incentives align to push this research direction throughout the infectious disease community as everyone (e.g., researchers at universities and government labs in China and US, guys like Fauci that administer the research and grant money) depends on the flow of research funding.Once we started pushing into gain of function, China mirrored the research direction and, in typical Chinese ‚Äúcan do‚Äù fashion, cut corners and accidentally released the virus.

                        At some point, in the the reign of Barry the Kenyan I think it was,  gain of function  research was banned by the Congress- There can be no pretense that it‚Äôs defensive or medicinal- it‚Äôs biological warfare research, which is globally banned.They took the usual approach, as with torture the pretense is that if it doesn‚Äôt happen in the US, it‚Äôs not the US doing it.All the GoF research is out-sourced, I think I‚Äôve seen 6 or 7 countries mentioned. That‚Äôs why Faucci was funding Wuhan.

Gain of function was banned in us in 2014. Ban expired in 2017 (see link). So, IMO, no need to out source ‚Äúbiological warfare research‚Äù to China. If were interested in this academic field you could have done this work in your kitchen.

Answer to Whiskey‚Äôs original question, ‚ÄúBut the intent was to create a bio weapon. Otherwise why fool around with them?‚Äù We and they (US and China) fooled around with it because we wanted the grant money.

        The great divide in families. Here is a bit of levity, so I hope. I just got off the phone with a pair of cousins. They‚Äôre in the process of clearing out the family home of 50+ years (the family Matriarch died a year ago).Any way the oddity? On the phone today, they asked with concern, was I vaccinated? I said no, and no plans to. They‚Äôd love to have me visit them sometime this summer, but she was concerned that I might catch COVID and die! Now, this was novel to me. Why, I asked her, would I be at any greater risk from them, than from any random person? My question seemed to baffle her, in its implications. Is this, as I fear, just another example of the divergent thought processes that the hive mind will manifest?  I love my extended family, but I must confess that living several hundred miles away from them has its advantages üòÄ

                So I called my doctor‚Äôs office today to schedule a COVID antibody test ‚Äì a blood draw. My wife and I had a flu-like illness in February 2020 that we both recovered from in less than a week. No other problems in the subsequent 18 months. Maybe we had COVID?The whole ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù push smells wrong to me, so I am not inclined to submit. I figure if I have already had it, no point in taking part in the great gene therapy experiment, and since most travel restrictions I have read allow for proof of antibodies in lieu of proof of ‚Äúvaccination‚Äù (something you won‚Äôt hear discussed widely), I thought I would get the antibody test, and if positive, use that as my ‚Äúpassport‚Äù and quick answer to peer pressure from friends and family. Fortunately, I am retired and can‚Äôt be forced to choose between a mystery drug and a job.So I discover this from my insurance company: COVID test (up the nose) is free ‚Äì haven‚Äôt done that and don‚Äôt intend to, ever; ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù of any variety is free. Antibody test? I must pay full cost up front out of pocket. Hmm. This only convinces me more to get the antibody test, because the establishment is de-incentivizing it.Either way, I‚Äôm not volunteering for a medical experiment, never have, never will. I‚Äôm just looking for an alternative method of getting on a plane to Spain.

        China has the benefit of ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù from failed 20th century dictatorships. I think chief among them is to never let your professed ideology interfere with the pragmatism necessary to gain power. They told the West everything they wanted to hear, exploited the vast cheap labor supply and in the end, put themselves in the critical path of most of the worlds supply chains. Attaining that power is one thing, holding on is another. China has never suffered an economic downturn since ~1976 and I doubt the leadership (that‚Äôs been in place for decades) could handle it without means of force.

        I thought everyone (outside the MSM) now understands it was most likely a deliberate release by rouge US-Israel deep state guys targeting China-Iran (that accidentally blew back to the rest of us). Yes it was indeed invented in a lab but unlikely an accidental release. Ron Unz has some good &amp; rigorous analysis that to me seems at least 75% likely. I‚Äôm surprised Z has not kept up here‚Ä¶.

        From Sir John Glubb, The Fate of Empires:‚ÄúThe first direction in which wealth injures the nation is a moral one. Money replaces honour and adventure as the objective of the best young men. Moreover, men do not normally seek to make money for their country or their community, but for themselves. Gradually, and almost imperceptibly, the Age of Affluence silences the voice of duty. The object of the young and the ambitious is no longer fame, honour or service, but cash.‚Äù

            They are being squeezed out of some financial and real estate markets. Also take note of where China‚Äôs sole overseas naval base. It complements Russia‚Äôs Syrian base. These people are done but they will try to take the world down with them.

            Everything is slipping through their fingers. They know it, and they are panicking.&gt;The American populace hates them, so they‚Äôve established a fascist regime to repress dissent. Say the wrong thing and they‚Äôll take away your internet and bank account.&gt;Asians and Europeans aren‚Äôt much into 24/7 blackworship, so Hollywood‚Äôs cultural influence is waning fast: Japanese cartoons and videogames are eclipsing domestic ‚Äúwoke‚Äù products; Hollywood movies like Star Wars cratered in Asia; everything with POC or ‚Äústrong women‚Äù in them crashes and burns; the only things Hollywood can make are reboots of things created by Whites because all their promoted POC talent isn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ talented enough to make things non-POCs want to see; American awards shows are all but dead ‚Äî nobody around the world cares since they went full BET. Meanwhile, Asian films have won multiple Oscars and their culture is increasingly seen among the Western youth (how many videos on YouTube are there of Europeans taking trips to Japan? Lots).&gt;Asians do well scholastically, out-competing their children, so the Regime has to rig college admissions to keep them out. Biden dropped Trump‚Äôs lawsuit alleging, probably correctly, anti-Asian discrimination at Ivy League schools. The Regime also has to sabotage Asian political candidates, guys like Andrew Yang, lest they become too influential and threaten their interests.&gt;Black / everyone else gaps haven‚Äôt closed and now obviously never will. So, it‚Äôs increasingly hard to buy off that demographic so they won‚Äôt just steal all their rivals‚Äô stuff like the people of Zimbabwe did in regards to White farmlands.&gt;China, despite the wishful thinking about Asians not being creative, is starting to be able to out-compete Silicon Valley. So, the Regime has responded by trying to ban Chinese apps like TikTok and sabotaging Chinese tech firms like Huawei. Apparently, Western liberals can‚Äôt do basic math. Even if the Chinese were only half as creative as Western Europeans, which I disagree with, they have such an enormous population that they can easily make up for it on volume.&gt;Europe no longer fears Russia, so there is increasingly little reason to justify NATO‚Äôs continued existence. So, the regime whips up anti-Russian hysteria to keep their vassals in line. But that won‚Äôt last. Europeans will eventually choose their Russian comrades over the cultural aliens running the United States, a people who neither look nor act like Europeans and even hate them and, potentially, might even work against their interests one day ‚Äî promoting CRT in Europe, encouraging mass immigration into the continent, statue destruction, etc.&gt;Europe is slipping away. They aren‚Äôt going to want to play submissive partner to a country that is increasingly alien to them. The bonds of familiarity are breaking down. The French president has described the ruling ideology of the democrat PMC elite as a danger to France. Europeans no longer look to the US as a place where they can come and make their fortunes because Europeans are racially discriminated against. Lots of Hollywood‚Äôs best creators, for instance, were Europeans ‚Äî even in recent history. But not so much anymore as Europeans have been kicked out in favor of American POC demographics. In the future, there will much less European attachment to the United States because it will no longer be familiar to them.Etc etc etc.I expect things to get much worse in the future as this empire is forced to reap what it sowed. I can‚Äôt say I have much sympathy.

        I‚Äôm agnostic, as always, on China. I don‚Äôt know enough about their motives (or ours) to form a concrete opinion yet.Are they looking to expand as a regional power in Asia, create a multipolar world, attract talent from the West and other places, help develop the third world through BRI, etc? Those are probably all good things. It‚Äôs really none of my business who‚Äôs fighting whom in East Asia. The Chinese in Taiwan and HK can fight against the Chinese in China, not my problem.But, are they looking to colonize the West? Implement a social credit score here? Are they looking to exact revenge and exterminate all whiteys because we colonized them at one point? Are they influencing the crazy coming out of US media, institutions, and politicians? If that‚Äôs the case then I‚Äôm certainly not ‚Äúdown‚Äù with those plans.The West, especially the USA, is evil, bloated, feminized, and geriatric. In many cases no longer demographically Western. Anti white. A little competition is probably good.I‚Äôm personally not sold on the supposed Chinese genius, they‚Äôve done a good job copying and stealing Western tech, that‚Äôs about it. They are also facing severe demographic problems due to low birth rates for decades. But again, we‚Äôll see. So far they are not Globohomo and do not hate or replace their own people, which is nice to see compared to the West.

            That‚Äôs the thing tho, they are NOT real competition.
It‚Äôs like I have always noticed, there is no fun or sense of accomplishment if a white person bests a black person in something.  It‚Äôs like why do we even have to compete?   Why do we have to get in the mud and in the mix with them?
But then besting another white guy?  Oh hell yeah, that‚Äôs fun and gets the blood pumping.  Yeah yeah let‚Äôs go at it bro.  I guess it‚Äôs a form sibling rivalry writ large.

                I joke that the biggest industry in Toronto is minorities (well, majorities actually) buying Bee Em Double Us and Mer Say Dees.It‚Äôs not just Chinese who are status obsessed.

They cannot seem to ‚Äúself actualize‚Äù ‚Äì get hobbies, have a personality, be unique in any way.It‚Äôs another problem of slamming foreign peoples together into one and expecting them to have the same results. I‚Äôm sure they would be much happier in China, where maybe owning a BMW would get you laid. Not my people, not my problem.

        I am not even remotely a subject expert on this matter, but it looks like that reactor design uses some unique material setup for it‚Äôs fuel rods which may have led to voids in the rods and a buildup of gasses therein.  The whole thing reminds me of Boeing‚Äôs clever 737 redesign that worked fine so long as the people using it were highly skilled, but then sold it to a bunch of unskilled people.

            Not really, the MAX was a result trying to make a new plane  on the cheap without re-engineering the 737 airframe and bypass all the expensive FAA certifications to put a new jet in the air.  And it bit them in the ass.Another problem is that today‚Äôs Boeing is far different than the company that produced the original 737 and 747, Now it‚Äôs full of pajeets and AA hires in management along bean counters who think they are qualified to approve aircraft designs and mods.And the CEO has promised to make 20% of the workforce black by the late 2020‚Äôs.The Chinese are thieving bastards but at least they are not suicidal like our high IQ WASPs and Ivy Leaguers.

                The Boeing design/software could be improved, what can‚Äôt‚Äîbut the fact remains there are documented instances of American pilots recovering from the same problem that crashed the two jets from turd-world crap holes.  Basically, Boeing developed an airplane that was push bottom and convince a lot of countries they could play with the ‚Äúbig-boys‚Äù if they bought this plane.Look for such instances of hubris to happen with more frequency in the US as our AA graduates rise to their level of incompetence.

        I may have said this before, but suppose it‚Äôs worth repeatingI was in Chinatown in San Francisco and there was a big barrel by the counter inside a store.  The thing was full to the top with little toys and Knick knacks.   To me it was just stupid junk.   Think not even hot wheels cars but matchbox lower rate cheap stuff, and rubbery plastic dinosaurs and that sort of thing.  I‚Äôm sure half the stuff had pieces missing scattered throughout the barrel.   But the thing is, there were Chinese tourists all gathered around it fingering through it literally going ooh and aah and all so proud of their peoples‚Äô creations.   They were scooping it up and buying it.When I got back to north beach and saw those Italian tri colors around the lampposts it was like I had entered back into a different world,   All the glass wares and little boxes of candies and so on were made with such care and pride and artistry.On one hand, the Chinese seem to have zero  conceptual reference for quality and craftsmanship and don‚Äôt seem to even care.   I guess those ideas are foreign to them.But yet they all want their kids to learn Bach and Beethoven.How can the mind of a person be satisfied with making junk but then be determined to master classical music?  It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.  But maybe to them Bach is junk and they only learn it for ulterior motives?Not sure what to make of them, but I‚Äôm not sold on them and think they‚Äôll be just another non white people who bring us down by their proximity and vastly different standards.

                Do we make any junk?People may mock me for this, but I am a huge fan of LEGO and have a ton of it, lots of it never opened waiting for my eventual grandkids to enjoy.  But LEGO is a quintessential white man‚Äôs toy.No one can say that LEGO is not top notch quality.  Those pieces have been around for over 50 years and still intact.  And you should see the Asian ripoffs of it, what a total joke.I am also big into watches and have a nice collection of Swiss and German and Italian.  Beautiful timeless creations.  Asian watches are junk.I could go on and on.  Sure, lots of American stuff is getting junky, but chalk that up to ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù meaning made by our lovely diversity of people.

                    Mrs. Poz makes an effort to buy American stuff as much as possible and actually spends quite a bit of time online looking for these things. Some are hard to find because the owners are also the factory floor workers, the accountants, and the marketing dept. Guess which one gets neglected. On the whole the stuff we‚Äôve bought is better than Chinese shit but that‚Äôs a low bar. It doesn‚Äôt stack up to German quality levels though.This is what happens when you send all your big factories to the third world. Old geezers working out of garages with hand tools have to rebuild the industrial based from scratch one tiny company and product at a time. Is this possible? I‚Äôm skeptical. One of things that genuinely saddened me about Trump getting overthrown was that his plan to re-industrialize went with him and in fact the push to send everything to China and other Asian shitholes accelerated. Even if Trump wasn‚Äôt sincere, his promises made further de-industrialization difficult since it could not proceed with official approval as it can now.

                        Pozymandias:  Modern stuff labeled ‚Äòmade in America‚Äô was most probably made here of foreign components, and almost guaranteed the factory workers were illegal Mestizos or Africans.
Older made in America things (tools, furniture, etc.) are worth looking for and buying.  Nothing new, though.  It‚Äôs all cheap, poorly made junk.  Of course, I remember when the cheap plastic toys which Falcone is referring to all bore a sticker which said ‚ÄúMade in Japan.‚Äù  How things have changed.

                        Yes, aesthetically Rolex is clunky for my tastes too, but they have some streamlined models, but most important to me is they are made like tanks.  There‚Äôs a neat little German brand, Nomos, which makes very utilitarian type watches but with enough flair to be aesthetically pleasing.  I have a couple of them.  But don‚Äôt get me started on watches, I will never shut up.

                        RoBG:  I traded away bins and bins of LEGO years ago.  My older son started with it age 3; by age 4 he was building the 500 piece sets just by looking at the pictures when I was still trying to figure out the instructions.  We‚Äôd be debating which version of a set to buy and my father-in-law would just buy all of them for him.
Younger son just wasn‚Äôt that interested in them, so they gathered dust.  And the company has gone massively woke.  Whatever, all those bins are someone else‚Äôs problem now.

            Mark turns a good phrase, but the article is pretty much what everyone here understands already.  My hope is that he reaches some ‚Äúnormies‚Äù‚ÄîHillsdale neocon, civnats.
BTW: I was there several years ago.  I loved the place, but they are a bastion of an idealized past, which really never was and will never will be.

            Steyn has a few normie-con mind blocks, but he remembers where we‚Äôve been and he despises every member of the present political order, from Xi to the local dog catcher. Those are the two necessary virtues of our time, so rare among conservatives that he might be the only example.

        I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been necessarily wrong to reach out to the chinks as they‚Äôre now the big dog in that region. But it needed to be done with eyes wide open ‚Äì they‚Äôre disingenuous at best and outright liars at worst.  Knowing this, you slap them up side the head when they uppity/unruly.  Kind of like the way we used to deal with joggers.  But as we‚Äôve gone soft on them to our detriment, so have we with the chinamen.  Trump tried to change the tenor, but it‚Äôs probably too late anyway ‚Äì too many politicians and corporate execs on the payroll one way or another.  And there‚Äôs really nothing we can do regarding their influence and ambitions in the region.  Biden and his dementia is the perfect avatar for our (former) country‚Äôs current status ‚Äì not exactly a toothless tiger, but lots of teeth missing.

        ‚ÄúThis is why China is the world‚Äôs most prolific patent thief. It is why they are the world‚Äôs primary exporter of counterfeit goods, as well as narcotics. Nothing about these practices strike the Chinese as wrong.‚Äù
Well, aside from believing in the divinity of man, why would China care about the effects of narcotics on other countries? They experienced the West importing opium into their country for which the West felt no remorse. Makes you wonder how much of Chinese machinations are due to the revenge motive.

            Sort of. They have no qualms poisoning their own people or working them to death, giving them defective medications and just turning their own country into one giant toxic waste dump.

            There was plenty of opium supplied to the Chinese by their own government.The Indian opium,surprise, was better quality.Nothing foreigners have done to the Chinese compares  to what they have done and are doing to each other. It‚Äôs almost as if the opium argument is a flimsy excuse to justify bad behavior.Why does this stupid revenge argument only apply when attacking the West? The Crusades were a fair response to the invasion of Europe by Muslims and the frequent slave raids? Imagine the English justifying selling Swedish civilians as  slaves because of the Vikings. It‚Äôs a pathetic argument and you should feel embarrassed about trying to use it.

At the end of WW2 the US government grabbed a bunch of war criminals from the Japanese biological warfare outfit Unit 731 and granted them amnesty in exchange for insight into their research that included live vivisection of Western POWs.

            Your analysis is correct, but you fail to mention the most important insight. There is no mechanism for correcting this treason. The US government is infested with corrupt sleepers that are actively destroying the country from the control room. They own the Judicial system and federal police. And they own the press too, so information-based persuasion is non-existent. This is no cavalry coming over the hill to save us. And if you think voting harder will save the day, see Election 2020 for the seminal Blackpill.It‚Äôs not enough to just explicate the problem endlessly. At some point, you actually act in self-defense or die.

                    Alzaebo, I know you mean well, but you‚Äôre way off the mark. First, as I have commented previously, the time is not now. Collapse leads to chaos &amp; crazy, which creates the necessary fog &amp; distraction in which remedy may commence. Second, education has a two-fold benefit in the present. Obviously, there are smart ways to train &amp; prepare during the interregnum. But many will wait until the 3:00 am knock on the door before they wake up, and then it‚Äôs likely too late. So impressing others with the seriousness of current events may rescue a few more, and that often takes a 2√ó4 upside the head.

            Well, our corporate billionaire class is quite open about wanting to achieve immortality.
They‚Äôre not going to let little things like morality or ethics stand in the way of genetic engineering, cloning, or even just garden variety organ harvesting if they can get around the law by sending $$$ and brains to China.

        This problem is mostly domestic and internal. MFN never should have been granted China in the first place, as you pointed out, and our manufacturing based should not have been offshored and outsourced. There is a domestic ethnic group who profited wildly from doing it, but for the most part Heritage Americans have suffered horribly. That group is Heritage America‚Äôs biggest problem.But‚Ä¶It looks like that domestic Tribe has learned it cannot financialize China‚Äôs economy and never will have sway with the PRC. Therefore, after covering up for the Wuhan leak, this same group and its paid whores in the political and corporate class are gearing up for war/cold war. This is just as insane as giving away the farm to China.The Chinese goal was to keep the American political class bribed, to keep expanding American markets, and to wait out the pending implosion of the United States. It is still their plan (Russia is just waiting us out). But the Dying Empire has new plans because its internal pimps are butt hurt.We need to disengage from China to the fullest extent possible, but war should not even be on the table. It would be like punching your brother-in-law because he drove the car after an unsuccessful bank robbery.  Further, that Tribe‚Äôs ongoing forever war with Russia because a great-grandmother got ravished by Cossacks has put the United States into an even weaker position than it would have been. American policy for fifty years was to keep Russia and China at odds, and this Tribe‚Äôs mental instability and greed have driven the nations close together. Read a transcript of Putin‚Äôs interview with NBC, which is an intelligence community propaganda organ. The most interesting part is where the interviewer wants to drive a wedge between China and Russia. Putin has a hard time containing his laughter and mockery. His urge to tell the USG ‚Äúyou really screwed the pooch‚Äù must have been ovewhelming.But/for the nuclear damage we all would suffer, a United States humiliation at the hands of either nation actually might be good for us because it would present a grand opportunity to separate. But the Empire would turn internally and at least try to conduct a war it could win, which would be our extermination. Watching the recent moves of the Tribe‚Äôs main executioner Merrick Garland, genocide certainly is on their depraved and wicked minds.This is one area Trump had exactly right: peace with Russia, a firm but even hand with China. Of course, since those who financialize everything could not get a cut, that had to be scuttled and Trump destroyed.

            Excellent take.
I would only add that every move made by the sheepskin shoe‚Äôd Deep State during the past five years could not have been more precisely designed to push Russia and China together‚Äô almost as if that had been their goal all along.

                They‚Äôre not that smart or effective. They bully well but that‚Äôs about it.
The Tribe and their USA puppet thought China triumphalism would neuter Russia. They are that crazy and thick. Instead of the Changsteins running the PRC, Chinese may be snapping up Tel Aviv real estate and peddling it to Syrians.

            Agreed, Jack.I happen to know alot of tribe members and the switch flipped on China in the past year. Suddenly the all hate China, China is the #1 enemy, they‚Äôre almost doing another holocaust, etc. etc. etc.Unfortunately for them, that ship sailed long ago. First of all, the West demographically cannot compete with China anymore. Is Brazil a threat to China? Is South Africa? Is Zimbabwe? The under 20 group in the USA is quite similar to Brazil, racially. Second of all, everything we made has been outsourced to ‚Ä¶ China ‚Ä¶ Thirdly, the white population has been demoralized and the non-white population has been trained to hate both whites and the USA.As I‚Äôve said before the J‚Äôs fate is intertwined with the gentiles. As we sink so do they. China has to do nothing but wait.

                Hmmm.  Interesting.  Wonder if that‚Äôs why Jon Stewart came out bashing the Chinese?   And the other day one of us mentioned a Chinese newscast where the pill faced chinaman commentator, with a British accent btw, went along asking ‚Äúrhetorically‚Äù of course if there might be a connection between America‚Äôs support for Israel and the powerful ((())) lin this country. I believe he singled out zuckerberg among a few others.   It actually had me laughing a little.

                    I first noticed when a J told me he felt ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù at the number of Chinese faces at the supermarket.
I was quite surprised because I‚Äôd never heard of any Jewish ‚Äì Chinese hostility before then. Since then it‚Äôs really increased, in the media too as you say.
Ultimately it doesn‚Äôt matter, the gentile is the host for the Ashkenazi. A J will never be anything more than a suspicious, white, foreigner to Asians.

                        I know in Los Angeles, the ((())) are pretty big and entrenched in commercial real estate.My sense of things is that they liked initially having all these Asians over here because they felt deep down they would be no match for them, so just another tribe for them to step on and prove their superiority. Another notch it the belt.  Anyone else want to try and come take us on?  Anyone?  They act like Mike Tyson standing over an opponent they‚Äôd knocked to the mat.‚Ä¶but, it‚Äôs not quite working out as planned.  The Chinese and Koreans are starting to buy everything up, keep it in their tribe, closing out the ((())).  They have started a number of banks in Los Angeles.  Slowly, methodically they are building real power in both banking and commercial property. I laugh because it used to be all white frat boy types and ((())) as the major brokers in town.  Not anymore.  And Armenians are making deep inroads too.Perhaps the ((())) are feeling themselves being cut out of the system and they are responding with an increasing vitriol.

            The China rise has long been anticipated and worked for by our Dear Leaders.The inestimable James Corbett has looked at this several times over the past decade.  I think he starts in about 1919 when Mao was appointed Yale‚Äôs man in China.By no coincidence whatsoever he looked at the China story just a couple of days ago.https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-1649-james-corbett-destroys-the-china-war-propaganda/

        Z‚Äôs comments about Chinese values reminds me of when I worked in China, Chinese told me that they would never pay for online content, such as movies, because doing so would bring shame to their family. They said if relatives found out they were paying to download music or a movie and not saving the money towards buying real estate, the relatives would feel that the parents had failed to bring up their kids properly.

            I suspect this whole ‚Äúcheating is better than playing by the rules‚Äù attitude is part and parcel of the Asian mentality. The Japanese are certainly no different than the Han. In Japan it is actually considered better to cheat a gaijin (foreigner/non-Japanese) than it is to treat him honorably ‚Äì so long as you do not get caught. There are similar traits in Western history. Craftiness was a virtue in classic Greek culture. Heck! The patriarch, Jacob, rooked his brother, Esau, out of his (Esau‚Äôs) birthright for a bowl of beans and was a father of the Jews! As a Christian I never quite understood that incident.

                Its not meant to be taken literally. Its an allegory. It really means don‚Äôt give up on God and eternal salvation for worldly goods, its like trading your birthright for a bowl of porridge.

        There will be no reset with China unless it becomes a threat to Israel, something that China is too shrewd to do because they know that the tribe runs the US.The real upcoming battle involving the US and China will be between the tribe, the Chinese and the Indians. The Chinese and the Indians may not be satisfied to remain forever subservient to the tribe in control of the US. The Indians are culturally better prepared to replace the Jews but India is a mess and the Chinese have China to help them take control of the country from the tribe.Will the tribe allow this or will they and the remainder of white America face off against the Asian interlopers? Most whites will never go against the tribe because of the nonsense about Judeo Christian values.

            I think the Tribe has decided to go full bore against the PRC precisely because it cannot financialize and control its economy. This is what is motivating the sabre rattling over the Wuhan leak all of a sudden. If this is played right, the Tribe will start to feel the heat within the United States.

            American war planners have long dreamed of making India ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Aircraft carrier‚Äù against a rising China, but that pipe dream has already set sail on them.The democrat party stabilizes its voting coalition by whipping up hatred of any White group seen as being ethnonationalist ‚Äî pitting their POC against Whites fighting for their collective interests. This has, perhaps inadvertently, rubbed off into general hatred by the PMC Left for the current nationalist government of India: Jonathon Oliver ran a segment a few weeks ago attacking the Indian PM, crowds of Leftist antifa destroyed multiple statues of Gandhi during the 2020 BLM Riots, and the American media has repeatedly attacked the Indian government over their handling of Covid-19 (even supporting mass protests against Modi‚Äôs rule).India has responded by trying to ban American social media through legislation and targeted police raids of their local HQs. Just as Europe is slipping through the Empire‚Äôs fingers, India is as well. They correctly perceive American racial divisiveness as a threat to Indian stability. If that ideology were imported to India and adopted by the elite, it would be a disaster.It looks as though everything is unraveling for the Empire. Their friends are finding new friends, the populace hates them, and an economic crisis could be coming up in the next few years as the US dollar loses purchasing power while the Chinese currency appreciates in value, allowing Chinese consumers to out-compete Americans in the marketplace for their own agricultural products, which will dramatically hurt the poor.*Note: this is one of the reasons for the current Leftist PMC craze about eating insects to save the earth. In the future, the American dollar will buy less and the Chinese currency, once the government there allows it to increase in value, will buy more. American PMCs are going to get rich selling the Chinese your meat products while middle class Americans are going to have to get used to products that cost 2 ‚Äì 3x what they do now, either that or learn to eat delicious bugs and vegetable paste with Turkey flavoring for Thanksgiving. The PMC Left is trying to get everyone used to that future because the US dollar won‚Äôt be the global reserve currency 20 years from now, so it will buy less and foreigners will be able to buy more of the things you want, driving up the price to unaffordability.In fact, this has been happening for years. I‚Äôve seen countless news stories starting maybe a decade ago attributing Chinese demand for agricultural products as the reason why your Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners are more expensive than they used to be.Dark times ahead.

                The West is no longer seen as the leader of the world. There are many positive traits in Hindu culture, Chinese culture, even Islamic culture that the West can learn from. Absent Christ, and adherence to His statutes and judgements, we are just another bumbling, mediocre civilization.India will be entering a demographic crisis in the coming decades, too. Muslims are growing as a % of the population every year. Slowly, for now. Punjabis are causing problems back in India and are a general nuisance as always, same as in the West. Smart fraction Hindus are going to the West, intermarrying with whites, and dropping to very low fertility rates. The more developed South India already has fertility rates at or below the level of the USA. Hindus are more or less the white people of India. The hour is our 1980, for them. (PS just because I call them the white people of India DOES NOT mean I want them coming to the West).Xi and co. must be pissing themselves with laughter as they successfully psy-op the whiteys into eating bugs and living in shipping containers. AND doing it voluntarily!

        Now is a good time to distinguish Anglo-Saxon whites from other European whites. Z‚Äôs essay today may invite people to say that white people are more honest and fair-dealing than Chinese, but the truth is that Anglo-Saxon whites operate on the the better principles outlined in the essay, while the French, for example, at least traditionally, do not. Nor do the Poles. Or Italians. They may not be as strictly coercive as the Chinese, but they are more similar to the Chinese than Anglo-Saxons are.In the same vein, the Chinese have always been an Asian superpower hemmed in by uncivilized brutes on three sides. Countries that develop in this environment tend to be paranoid, rule-braking, and their leaders tyrannical. (Russia has much the same flavor.) There is no time to be patient and rational. Weakness gets you invaded and your brother put on spikes.

                Historically the Chinese have been the civilizational examples to the other east and southeast Asian civilizations, not the other way around. And the Japs, like the Brits, have had an island all to themselves, so they had the luxury of being stodgy and honor-based. No Hun, Turkic, or Mongol hordes to fight off.

                        Ironically, the public ‚Äúface‚Äù in Korea and China was to openly disparage the Japanese when convenient. How much of that is an act is anyone‚Äôs guess. The greatest hatred comes from those who suffered, or allegedly so, at the hands of Japanese imperial occupation. They also share a common trait with peoples from Western countries who participated in the Pacific war in that regard. As they die off you see the subsequent generations profess a hatred for the Japanese, but they often have little to no connection to past atrocities other than being related to those who did. Think of the boomer who had an uncle who was a POW in the Pacific. No rational reason for said hatred, but the boomer will often more strongly express his disdain than the relative who experienced the actual horrors. Same thing.Could be talking out my ass, but internet Orientalists always seem like their understanding of Asian face culture stopped at Karate Kid, and the ‚Äô80s, and went no further.

I‚Äôve watched countless rule following Anglo Saxons destroy their physical and mental health during the COVID ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù. Indians on the other hand ignore every rule and pretty much live on as normal.
Also, when Anglo Saxons follow the rules of the Bible, it‚Äôs ok. In the secular world today following the rules of society is a path straight to destruction and hell.

            This is a meta-comment worthy of further exposition. Yes, civilizations are subject to evolutionary forces in a way similar to longer-term species development. IOW, the Chinese cultural proclivity for law-breaking is a result of the selection forces that evolved in their locale. It‚Äôs a feature, not a bug. Without it, they likely would have gone extinct long ago. But it only ‚Äúworks‚Äù in their neighborhood. When it gets exported to other ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, it goes into conflict with the traits that are dominant in the new location. This conflict is just fitness selection writ large. One trait will win out and the other will lose eventually.

But again that‚Äôs the regular people.   But take an Italian trying to make a buck and you get your typical greaseball conniving pos.Perhaps it‚Äôs making money that brings the worst out of all of us.   I know it‚Äôs necessary, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact

                        I worked abroad and worked with a very polished Indian guy who sounded like a a product of Eaton and Cambridge and whose father had worked for the British Imperial government. I offered a similar suggestion about Brits who had emigrated to the States and other places, and he offered keen insight. The United Kingdom is (was, really, this was the Eighties) a wonderful country and natives who moved at that time had a solid reason to do so. It made sense.
Obviously all of our wonderful countries are things of the past now.

            I‚Äôve brought this up before but there‚Äôs a, perhaps apocryphal, story regarding the future dictator of South Korea, Chun Doo-hwan, attending military training in the United States.  It‚Äôs said that he was out late one night and driving back to his home when he got to a red light in a podunk four-corners town.  Even though there were no other cars on the road, the car in front of him sat at the red light until it turned green.  He was struck by this and motivated to move Koreans toward a similar innate respect for the law.

                For me it‚Äôs just easier to obey the traffic laws/rules than not. Yeah, in that scenario there was little practical reason not to go on the red but if you make a habit of doing so you are pretty much assured of either not seeing the cop down the street or not seeing the asshole doing 90 down the cross street and getting T-boned. Do I occasionally catch a ‚Äúpinkey‚Äù? Sure. But I do not make a habit of it nor do I make a habit of failing to stop at stop signs. The few seconds I might save are not ‚Äì TO ME ‚Äì worth the potential hassle.

        And yet the root of this problem is that the people of this country continue to enable rule by the insane &amp; the corrupt. We have been sold out by our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù for decades now in exchange for the fast-track to great wealth. For example, Clinton was a dirt poor, white trash hick until he cashed in during the 80s &amp; 90s; first in Arkansas selling out to the cartels, and then later to the Chinese. Ditto Obama on yet a greater scale (Russia, China, Iran, &amp; Ukraine). Both are now billionaires, but neither could run a donut shop successfully.And none of this will change until after a collapse and the bottom of the pyramid has no choice but to fight back in existential survival mode. Sooner is least painful &amp; far less destructive. The longer it takes, the lower the bottom and more blood in the streets.

        ‚ÄúWestern ethics, as far as the Chinese see it, are just more rules to work around for fun and profit.‚Äù
Sounds like another group I know. And that‚Äôs the problem, a small group acting in their own interests feeding off a host is manageable (maybe), but a billion of them. No, that doesn‚Äôt work.
As always, the solution is ethno-nationalism. Deciding whom to work with and under what rules should be based on first and foremost on whether it‚Äôs good for your people as a whole. Once that‚Äôs determined, let individual actors compete.

            There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with Chinese having their own rules and ethics. Personally I don‚Äôt really care how they operate in China. They‚Äôve been around for a long time; if their values didn‚Äôt have some use they wouldn‚Äôt still be around. One nice thing about Chinese culture is the duty to your elders.There are basically 4 problems:1. The importation of these foreign people, by elites, disproportionately (but not always) by a certain tribe.2. The increasing influence exerted by these foreign peoples over us, as their numbers continue to grow (strongly connected to 1).3. The fact that most whites believe that all peoples are interchangeable and are capable of being like them; they are arrogant enough to believe that all peoples *want* to be like them. That we forget where wealth comes from, and the whole world can be as wealthy as the West; altruism. Assimilation!!4. Whites ourselves are declining spiritually, morally, and financially. Whites generally prefer to take drugs and party, and be sexually liberal, instead of going to church and having families. The whites of 2021 certainly don‚Äôt match up with the whites of 1961, or 1861, or 1761.

                That‚Äôs because for the last 40 years Wall Street and Hollywood have waged war on Whites. Wall Street starting in the 80‚Äôs  began gutting businesses with LBO‚Äôs and destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, stealing peoples pensions, etc. In the 90‚Äôs NAFTA sent millions of jobs to Mexico and created the rust belt devastating families, communities and futures.of the young.When Wall street got China MFN and entry into the WTO it was the final hammer blow to white blue collars and middle-class.Wal-Mart the cluster bomb  of capitalism helped kill off mom and pop businesses. Amazon is just finishing the job.At the same time Clinton opened up the immigration floodgates and H-1B via programs.Then came the Oxycontn epidemic created by Perdue and crooked doctors across the U.S. all the while the DEA did nothing. Later the cartels the came in with Fentanyl which they essentialyl purchased in bulk from China in the form of precursors.  Again we did nothing as China was poisoning our people. BTW did you Amazon, Wal-mart and Ebay help launder drug money back to China? Ever wonder about those books that cost $500 on ebay of Amazon. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done.Social Media socially and emotionally stunted our youth making them a trainwreck. And what it did to women is even worse. It‚Äôs almost destroyed man-woman relationships.Feminism destroyed marriage among other things.Hollywood pumped a steady stream of crap for the last 30 years that is hardly healthy compared to the fare from them earlier times.

        &gt;  The people with power threaten severe punishment for breaking their rules. Success is usually defined by navigating around the rules, while avoiding detection by the powerful. Violating the rules is not just a necessity. It is a way of life.
Sounds like American dissidents need to learn to be spiritually Chinese.

            How members of a society ate influenced operates on a hierarchy. At the top is the least coercive and most honest. This is rational persuasion, where truthful explanations are offered to explain to members why they should do something or not do something. This cannot exist beyond the Dunbar number, so the best we can hope for is manipulation. The use of propaganda, clever arguments and social proof to influence behavior. Inducement is where America has generally been, with some rational persuasion and manipulation thrown in for decoration and entertainment. We are now falling into the raw use of power, but it is limited power.China has never risen above coercion. This is one of he lowest forms of social influence.

                What they did not have, is the pervasive influence of the Gutenberg Bible.  The primer of literacy, morality, and history in the Westphalian West.The entire book is a persuasive argument.It was once held for exclusive use by the ruling classes- thus oratorical sermons on a dedicated basis, similar to how Quran is sung, not read, to the illiterate Arabs.  This training converged with European warrior‚Äôs honor systems into the knightly class, warrior-monks on a different axis than Muslim jihadis or Bhuddist Shaolin.Those knights still read the heros of Greece, as well, thus reinforcing honor-bound training for the military as the beginning career rung on the ladder for the ruling class.*****Huh.  I‚Äôd meant to speak to something else- the unimaginable origins of the Old Testament, and why its moral foundation is based on monotheism as an evolutionary response to something unfathomed so far.Monotheism is the ethical basis of the Enlightenment;  monotheism, as an operant system, also rewires European neural pathways.My poor head remains stuck in the distant past, not conducive to this blog‚Äôs thrust.  Thank you, and the commenters, I learn something helpful every day in trying to define the ineffable.

                How can the US survive as a nation with part of it under Divine Right of Kangz and the other under fairly brutal repression?

                    Uh, it won‚Äôt ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù. History has shown, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, that empires reach peaks, they get comfortable, they get lazy, they get soft, then they get stupid, then they eventually fall.
