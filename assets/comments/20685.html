        There are several time periods which make for comparisons to today.

What they all have in common is the feeling that we are in the waning days of anAncien Regime.

        There is a lot of maybes in your closing paragraph.I read a bunch of maybes yesterday from a post on my wife‚Äôs facebook. She has friended a female boomer cousin of mine who is all knee jerk Trump support, first responder type fan and such. Yesterday she and all the like minded friends of her went all maybe it‚Äôs time for the statues to come down and let them have their own heroes. Maybe protests are good, the new civic action don‚Äôt you know.How soon they flip and bend a knee and act like they always believed in the new normal. Of course most were women but then women do know when to jump ship and side with the new rulers, perceived or otherwise. I‚Äôm sure Greeks didn‚Äôt have to deal with these idiots they just swallowed the inevitable rot and faded away.We‚Äôre pathetic.

            I told a conservative girlfriend yesterday that women should never have been allowed to vote. And she agreed with me. Talk about crazy times! Now I‚Äôm just waiting for the Antichrist. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs next

                I‚Äôve gotten similar responses from several conservative women. They don‚Äôt want the responsibility.  Then again, these aren‚Äôt women with daddy issues.

                Because I‚Äôm an idiot, I had a similar conversation at work. Jokingly, of course, and I made the point that Prohibition would never have happened without women voting &amp; being politically active.One of these days, they‚Äôll send me to a camp.

                It sure does have a book of revalation feel to it . Especially the way the churches have been slammed by the shutdown. they have reopened the strip clubs and the pot despensaries never closed , but the churches are still not allowed to open in a functional way.

                    It illustrates the failure of the Church to stand for anything.  Once the Church stood separate and equal to the State.  Now it‚Äôs more often an appendage.

                            Sadly true, but also a bright side.  Belief is within the individual, and needs no organized and poz‚Äôd religious organization. Took me awhile to discover that after I wandered away from such organizations.  But as you‚Äôve probably concluded, I‚Äôm kind of ‚Äúslow‚Äù in these matters of understanding.  üòâ

                    Naw. Imagine what it was like in the 20s and 30s of last century. Dust storms that created their own weather patterns with giant lightning storms that probably made you think that God himself was upset with you. Don‚Äôt forget the famine, plague, and war. Not just war but industrial, mechanized war. Nothing glorious or honorable about machines chewing up meat and spitting out hamburger. They must have been sure that the end times were upon them.

                Back in the suffragette days, the majority of women didn‚Äôt want the franchise.The problem is that  Democracies and Republics  put a heavier weight on political noise rather than good sense and as such always drift left.

            Our statues say a lot.For example:  When they placed Defiant Girl by the Wall Street Bull, it symbolized two things, submission to the gynocracy, and a signal that we are no longer a serious country.On a positive note, what the left picks to replace the lost monuments will inspire no one, but will just be narcissistic masturbation for the art community.Ii will make Obama‚Äôs presidential portrait look acceptable by comparison.

                Yeap, and I might note that for others to have ‚Äútheir hero‚Äôs‚Äù does not necessitate the overthrow/replacement of other‚Äôs hero‚Äôs.  The Romans learned this in their expansion to empire.  Conquered areas had their hero‚Äôs and gods accepted within the Roman politic‚Äîas long Roman law remained supreme and the taxes rolled in.Jews could not accept this and were made an example of in typical Roman fashion.

                        Well, half of what you decry is now accomplished‚Äîmore or less.  Is it not?What do you call the removal of Confederate statues, Columbus defaced and his holiday ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù, military bases scheduled to be renamed, etc., We see such all around us almost daily.The cancel cultural R&amp;R simply awaits the second step for completion, replacement.  Postal service honors POC. US currency will tout a POC on the ‚Äútenner‚Äù soon.  Navy ships named for mediocre Black servicemen remarkable only because they simply did their duty.  Soon even that will not be necessary judging how quickly a felon like George Floyd can be transformed into national hero and martyr who must be worshiped‚Äîand is.As I‚Äôve said before, you can mark time and measure our decline by these occurrences.  You‚Äôll know the final defeat has happened when the Founding Fathers are cancelled.  And so it goes.

            Yes the war bride index is one of many barometers of the end times. But in a land where the future is a brown female, how long can statues of settlers and paintings of Delaware crossings that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look like me mommy‚Äù really be expected to stand?I remember years ago when I was a young, eligible bachelor. The big concerns of my contemporary women, aside from catching aids cuz we were all gonna die, was getting knocked up or married too young, impeding their career plans or law school dreams. Fast forward a decade and every girl inc publication was screaming: where are all the good men?What kind of empire doesn‚Äôt grow its own people?The double-helix of heritage America decoupled long ago. Luckily little hats invented social media, so all those feral female feelies can reattach to the script in real time and thirsty supplicating males can play their part to welcome refugees and take their knees for justice.

                ‚ÄúWhat kind of empire doesn‚Äôt grow its own people?‚ÄùOur empire was started by regional northern elites who destroyed regional southern elites to make themselves the defacto ruling class of the entire country. They then created unaccountable centralized institutions like the Federal Reserve but through arrogance, incompetence, and weakness allowed themselves to be displaced from those institutions by Jewish-led multiculturals. This left American non-elites to be ruled over by hostile foreigners who utilize the empty shell of our electoral system to give us the illusion that we have a say in civilizational decision-making. The post-WASP ruling class will happily let us vote on how much to pay county animal control, but will never willingly let the real Americans have any say in civilizational issues like immigration or monetary policy.

            My birthplace (thank God I never lived there) Washington DC put up a statue of the late not-so-great Marion Barry in 2018. Even comedian Chris Rock had a skit about Barry: ‚ÄúHe smoked crack and got his job back!‚Äù (re-elected into DC Gov.). If this is not a good memorial of how silly our country has become, what is? Can you imagine what future historians will think of us, if they know the story behind such venerated figures? üôÇ As was mentioned here in the past few days, given this, is it really such a stretch that Mt. Rushmore will be revised to portray (I propose) MLK, Barry, Obama, and perhaps a marytr like Floyd? If there is any ‚Äúgood news,‚Äù its that when Islam finally sweeps the former USA, they will dynamite those images just like they have with other historic icons, which are a no-no to their mysticism.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/still-bigger-than-life-dc-unveils-bronze-statue-of-former-mayor-marion-barry/2018/03/03/d77dfd60-1eee-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html

            The capitulation of whites these past two weeks has been stunning. Actually, it‚Äôs worse. Capitulation implies defiance. This is more of an embracing of the Cult of White Racism and Black Idolatry. CivNats, corporations, hell, NASCAR, all have fully accepted the narrative of white racism (past and present, conscious and unconscious) causing all of society‚Äôs ills.They all say that we need to listen to the black community, i.e. whites need to shut up and do as they tell us. If we thought that we were dissidents before, we‚Äôre much farther down that road now.

        We may be more like imperial Athens than we are like imperial Rome. But unlike the people of Athens the public face of our oppressor is not another Greek. It is a savage dancing in the firelight set by a ruling class that is rapidly losing its Greek character, whatever little it has left.

            This brings to mind Eastern Roman Empire Emperor Justinian sending his General Belisarius to ‚Äòliberate‚Äô Italia and bring it back within the empire. The descendants of actual genetic Romans weren‚Äôt cheering in the streets over having new ‚ÄòRoman‚Äô leaders who didn‚Äôt speak Latin but Greek replacing their contemporary Christian German rulers. Blood matters. If the only choices are between being ruled over by two sets of foreigners the best one can do is keep out of it as much as possible and hope the least noxious least degenerate side wins.That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt get worked up over Chinese infiltration. Yes, they despise us, but their primary strategic objective is to remove the threat the American Empire poses to their civilization. Their animosity is not exterminatory. I‚Äôd rather be ruled over by an aristocracy (natural or legal) of my own people, but barring that I‚Äôll take Chinese nationalist communism over Jewish internationalist communism any day of the week.

                The Chinese interest in the West strikes me at being more scavenger like than imperial like.  They have a few populous outposts here but most are more interested in mining what they can in both wealth and  knowledge and then heading home.  A lot of 1st, 2nd and even 3rd gen hyphenated Americans have headed back to the homeland.  Unlike the Indians, the vast majority of their US college grads return to China within a few years.Dominating trade and trade routes is what they focus upon‚Ä¶but political dominance on this side of the Pacific  strikes them as more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. Their version of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere includes the whole of Asia, all of Africa and control of all trade route along with the medium of exchange. They will have some setbacks but they will eventually get what they want.

                What evidence can you point to, in defense of the idea that the Chinese animosity to us is not exterminatory?  Heck, the Chinese appear to have an exterminatory approach to many of their own co-inhabitants.

            Also the Greeks stayed intact as a people during their imperial time. Rome and its army slowly became less ethnically Roman. Wish I could find it, but a historian back in the 20s or 30s looked at the graves of Rome and showed that ethnic Romans slowly disappeared, especially from the nobility. Between low fertility ‚Äì especially among wealthy Romans ‚Äì and immigration, the actual Romans just faded away.In addition, capable ethnic Romans who made up what was left of the middle class moved away to the provinces. Sound familiar?

                            Not disagreeing, but the Romans of Caesar‚Äôs time were not the Sicilians of today in the South, nor the Germanics of today in the North.  Perhaps some Gallic blood.  There were many tribes beyond the Italian Alps in Gaul and early on, Rome was successfully invaded by a tribe of Gaul (forget who, but it caused them to reorganize their army).  But the Germanics were on the other side of the Rhine when Rome was kicking ass under Caesar.After the fall of Rome, the Italian peninsula was invaded several times by tribes like the Vandals and Visigoths.  Not to mention all those damn slaves Caesar and company had taken in during the good times centuries before.There was a lot of blood mixing outside of the earlier major tribes of the Italian peninsula than combined under Roman rule in the early years.

        The lurch from enemy to enemy is just an increasingly desperate search for meaning. Consider, for instance, that there are several obvious things that totally cynical rulers would do if they wanted to crush opposition. Why not legalize fentanyl / oxycontin? Tranking Whitey out is a lot more efficient than beating him down. Same way with the obstreperous among the Diversity. Make ‚ÄúGhetto Affective Disorder‚Äù a DSM-VI syndrome and put the Pfizer whiz kids on it. The fact that this is both obvious and unthinkable says this is a fundamentally ideological crisis. Even Machiavelli, of all people, said that no one can be purely evil (by which he meant ‚Äúbrutally instrumentalist‚Äù) all the time, even when it‚Äôs to his obvious advantage. Military defeat is one option, but ideology can also defeat ideology.

                White American‚Äôs tend to Irish resistance regardless of ethnic background and as such slowly but surely things get worse. In economics this is  called friction and by and large its what we get.Large firms that could pretty easily do difficult projects now end up firing most of the capable employees on political grounds and being run like a bad junior high student council. Oh they can bungle  through projects but gradually they fail more and more.More and more facets of society get like this and than the nation   collapses or is forced to a level it  can maintain.The recent unpleasantness has sped things up a fair bit but if we follow the path the USSR set, we are about 15 years out, maybe a bit more.As for genocide or the like, its possible but Bad Whites are well aware of this possibility, becoming rapidly organized and have vast amounts of arms and the training to use them. Its unlikely.Also a real race war would force a collapse and as mentioned before the leaders of a rotten Empire will suffer nearly any indignity or humilation to keep the Empire alive another day.

Even Huang Ti, the ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù, was not; the Yellow Emperor defeated the Red, then erased him.Mao himself was a nobody, even during most of the Long March.It was there that he got noticed, outwitting a rival warlord with a force much, much larger.Dang I wish I could remember the details.

        The thing that will destroy the American Empire is the same thing that gave birth to America in the first place. A nation destroys itself when its founding principles are carried to absurd lengths. Sooner or later, radical egalitarianism will engulf us all in consuming flames of passion.

        ‚ÄúMaybe the end of history is what we are seeing today replayed over and over forever.‚ÄùWhen studying these historical parallels it‚Äôs interesting to look at each culture‚Äôs assumptions and presuppositions ‚Äì their worldview.  Every culture that has placed man as the penultimate center of the universe enters a death-spiral.  It‚Äôs as if the herd-man has a rabid desire to rid himself of metaphysical questions ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwe must find the meaning of life inourselves, inourlifetime‚Äù seems to be a common thread.  It‚Äôs also interesting to see how long it takes man-centered humanism to unravel when riding on the coattails of their ancestors‚Äô theistic worldviews.  (In our case, Christianity and Calvinism had LONG coattails.)When the cosmic order is smashed, God is dead, and metaphysical questions are dismissed, the end result is baked in the cake.  We‚Äôre created to replay history over and over, complete with despair and chaos ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs where man is designed to be after thumbing his nose at his Creator.

                Agreed.  I think the loss of faith comes after the loss of truth.  Read Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúLive Not By Lies.‚Äù  He was a fellow dissident who recognized that we each have individual responsibilities to secede from non-truth and courageously stand for reality.  You know what makes our enemy‚Äôs hair stand on end? ‚Äì Objective truth and verifiable reality.Interestingly, the embrace of man-centeredness is what drove the mainstream church into the arms of the Left (until the Left recognized they no longer needed them.)  J. Gresham Machen had a few things to say about this as he was drummed out of the Presbyterian church in the 1920s.  Another good read for any small-o orthodox, Machen‚Äôs‚ÄúLiberalism and Christianity.‚Äù  As a Christian I place the responsibility for our present American chaos on the church and cowardly believers.  Over the last couple millennia in Western cultures, wherever the church goes along to get along, disaster looms.

        ‚ÄúOnly a defeat in war can shatter that confidence in the democratic system.‚Äù Hell we‚Äôve been losing more than we‚Äôve been winning for a long time, even though it‚Äôs only in proxy wars far from home, and it hasn‚Äôt made the Powers that Be any less hubristic (only drones and flyover state whites die, so who cares?). America just doesn‚Äôt need to lose; it needs to lose on its home soil, and from the sky. I bet you the rioters (sorry ‚Äúprotesters‚Äù) might start being civil if someone dropped incendiaries and white phosphorus from the skies over Minneapolis and Chicago. Willy Peter makes men believers. I‚Äôd rather be ruled by Kim Jong Un or Putin than kinte-cloth wearing carpet kissers like Pelosi and Schumer. Bomb us yesterday, please.

                    Disabled kid with a blind fold and both his legs broken, really. Iraqi armored and infantry battalions had to use their recon units to see where nearby friendly units were. One particular laughable incident I remember in the push into Kuwait was a Republic Guard combat unit fielding school buses to the AO a few clicks away from American positions.

                    ‚ÄúWhite men are cowards, traitors, children, and pussies, on the whole.‚Äù Unfortunately this is true for the most part.White Seattle politicians and police have ceded a zone of the city to armed Antifa and BLM overlords who are requiring ID and protection money from the residents. And no one, including Orange Man, is doing anything but talking or tweeting.I saw it on a personal level when I was in elementary school and my family moved to a black ghetto. At the age of 10 or so I vowed to myself that ‚Äúthey‚Äù would have to kill me but I would fight back no matter what. Funny, or not so funny, I am having to have the same conversation with myself now as an old(er) man. With the difference being that there is a good chance I will be defending myself against white people.You never really know what you will do until you do it. I did it when I was young; will I do it when I am old? Don‚Äôt know yet but as Lineman notes it sure helps to have a Community.

                            I certainly will give Trump credit where credit is due.  And I absolutely agree that his ability to even get out of bed in the morning is stunningly amazing with the 24/7 hatred thrown his way from every direction.And he is not responsible to be my or our savior.That said and acknowledged, I at least hope he is John the Baptist to a future Jesus for all of our sake.

Iffy; a lot of people would ask why we even had people in these spots, I know I ask it of myself now.

        In a republic we need votes.
Allowing the Progressives to brainwash our women means we get fewer childre to vote with.
Allowing the usual suspects to financialize everything means we have no way to maintain community.
And finally allowing external powers rise on the back of our jobs like we have with China and allow the feral underclass to burn our cities and topple our statues while we sit on our ass and watch on TV in this Athenian distopia will be our undoing.

        ‚ÄúIt is more of a self-serving warning of an inevitable end dictated by history.‚Äù Your use of ‚Äúself-serving‚Äù is curious. This would mean ‚Äúhaving concern for one‚Äôs own welfare and interests before those of others‚Äù. Certainly a nation should put its own interests ahead of others, except perhaps in the rare case when an action really is ineverybody‚Äôsbest interest. But how could an inevitable end dictated by history ever be in a nation‚Äôs interest?Is the USA an empire? You‚Äôre damned right it is! Especially post WWII, America has dominated much of the world. The dollar is a ‚Äúreserve currency.‚Äù Much of the world speaks English as a second language, especially Europe that was conquered ‚Äî excuse me, ‚Äúliberated‚Äù by the USA. We have massive trade with these countries. We export a lot of our debt. In recent decades we‚Äôve been overrun by barbarians ‚Äî pardon me, ‚Äúenjoyed wholesome immigration.‚ÄùGreece was rarely (never?) an empire, as you observe. It was at best a coalition of often warring city-states. Modern Europe is not much better, minus the bloodshed.The Roman empire is probably the best historical portent to America‚Äôs future. Barring a major natural disaster (Asteroid impact, etc.) we are likely, in fact, to devolve precisely as the Roman Empire did: We will disintegrate into smaller countries, with a generous helping of regional civil wars. This isn‚Äôt rocket science. In our own lifetimes (well, most of us) we have the lesson of the ex-Soviet Union, now one or two dozen smaller countries. Just before America became the world power, our mother country (UK) lost the mantle. Their empire too has turned into a diverse collection of now independent nations. Before them, Spain. And so on. These former colonies of course still have a legacy of the one-time ruling country: languages, customs, legal systems. Even after 2000 years, much of the West still has recognizable traits of Greek wisdom, Roman principles of law, and bastard descendants of Latin üôÇUnlike the USSR, when America goes, as you note, there is no likely replacement as a world leader, so bet a few chips on some version of a Dark Age too.

        Clausewitz says that ‚ÄúWar is politics by other means.‚Äù The corollary to that is: ‚ÄúPolitics is war by other means.‚Äù


In liberal democracy, the vote is the ultimate weapon that will fell our nation state. A foreign army need not cross the mighty Atlantic or Pacific, he just needs to flood the country with enough voters and money to change the government policy of our nation.


That is the end of America. The unwashed refuse from abroad hanging us with the chads on the voting ballots we gave them.

        When we talk about military supremacy, we‚Äôre really talking about naval supremacy.  With the advent of hypersonic missiles anything floating on the water becomes a liability.  But much like the Europeans during WW1, we won‚Äôt comprehend that our military is assembled around dated technologies and strategies until it‚Äôs too late.  Carriers were already a liability before the new technology.  Now they may as well be white elephants, clipper ships, destined to go to the bottom of the South China Sea.  Ironically, where everything started going bad for us over half a century ago.  And, being a democracy, with citizens raised on Terminator movies about nuclear war, we will not pull the nuclear trigger.  We will retreat with our tail tucked between our legs as first Hong Kong, and then Taiwan is consolidated into greater China.  What‚Äôs left of our Navy will pull into base in a stunned silence, with an assorted mix of brown people, women, and homosexuals disembarking the ships that made it.  The economy will be a basket case by then, it already is.  The country will disintegrate from within after that.  One of my greatest fears is that our politicians, either party, will want some militaristic rallying point to bring us together.  It will be a disastrous, Spanish Armada like situation.  Calls for political retribution will be fierce.

            It is not just that it is obsolete.  If the carriers were not obsolete, the problem of replacing a sunk carrier still exists.We have the same problem with fighter jets. We simply do not have an industry capable of building them entirely from America or even America, Canada and Mexico.  Too many of the parts come from overseas that cannot be made here.  This is probably also true of tanks.All of the military is heavily dependent on technology that is not exclusively American.  Worse, the shipping lanes could not be kept safe by America and many of the imported parts come from the region, not to mention the country we are most likely to have a real war with.This stuff seems so obvious.  It is difficult to imagine that there are no adults in the Pentagon who understand this.This is the really obvious stuff.The military is loaded with ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù and their track record is horrible. The all black squardon of WW2, who were going against Germans with inferior training flying inferior planes and with every disadvantage, still had a very low kill ratio that if the rest of the airforce had, would have ended in our defeat. Even this was the cream of the black crop. Our military today does not have the cream of the blacks.

                Can you cite an example of a critical part not made here? Or more to the point can not be made here?  Airplanes are often joint ventures which allow other countries to purchase, but that we depend on these countries or the planes don‚Äôt fly?  Not sure I‚Äôve heard of that.  In any event, odds are a war will be short and whatever we need, we have on hand or we do without.  WWII‚Äôs long ramp up time is not planned for in WWIII.  But a I‚Äôve not a strategist.

                    I do not know the specific parts that could not be produced here. Presumably it would be the electronics. Our electronics industry has been decimated, especially in the last 25 years. Any LCD screen in these machines is imported, for example.It‚Äôs possible we could build factories to produce what we need, but that takes time. You have to build the building itself and all the production equipment. It all has to be engineered. Even a greatly accelerated program would likely take years. This is assuming the underlying infrastructure is capable of doing such a thing.

        Without getting into a spergy discussion of economics I would simply note that the sinews of the Anglo-Zionist empire are financial and always have been.This is why the actual military footprint needed to maintain it has been so small.Were I seeking to topple this arrangement I would strike at its linchpin: the dollar as global reserve.And I would strike in the chaotic aftermath of a couple of elections in which first one half of thedemosand then the other viewed the process and outcome as illegitimate.

        the fact that the covid scare and the riots have such a coordinated feel to them is true . Today they started the easily pricdictable ‚Äù second wave‚Äù screaming. The number you cannot ever find its the number of people tested. because if you could find that you could easily prove that the background rate of infection is constant and probably declining. The complicity of the GOP at the national, state and local levels in both of these eventslets the mask fall . We have no influience at all. where will we be in 2 years? look at china now .  Social scores, tracking , etc.the only diffrence will be that the CCP doesn‚Äôt hate the chineese people , whereas our  rulers clearly don‚Äôt like us .this means they are going to go back to the more severe lockdownsoon.The fall elections will be the kind of debacle that the Iowa caucus and more recent primaries have been.China has elections too, for what it‚Äôs worth.It would be intresting to hear Derb‚Äôs insight into how the average chineese manage life there .

            Ignore the infection rates. Look only at death rates. They can pad the death rates, but they can only pad them so much, because deaths require actual bodies.ETA: Well, let me walk that back a bit. It‚Äôsharderto fabricate the deaths, but not impossible.

                Northern Virginia remains on full lock down. Daily deaths in the state of Virginia with 8.5 million people have been in or near single digits for two weeks. Yesterday‚Äôs death toll: One. Day before: Two. Day before that: Three. Yet, we‚Äôre still on lock down.Total deaths: 1502. Death toll after three month 0.018%. So this Black Death will end up killing 1 out of every 5,000 people in the state, the vast majority of whom would have died in two years or less anyway.

                            My reply to exactly that shaming technique is that individual sacrifice on behalf of my fellow man is between myself, my minister, and God.  It can not be demanded by the State of a free individual and I refuse to relinquish that freedom.If folk are that concerned, then I propose they stay at home and self quarantine themselves, thus making us both happy.

                The initial bills designed to fight the pandemic included funding to hospitals for COVID patients.  Medicare pays $12K per COVID admission and $39K for intubation of a COVID patient.  Hospital administrators therefore label everyone and every death they can ‚ÄúCOVID related‚Äù and they are not audited by the Fed‚Äôs‚Äîespecially when there were few valid testing methods for the virus.This is rumored *not* to be a trivial number in the stat‚Äôs regarding the pandemic.  Where the truth will/may come to light is when the death records and numbers can be compared to death records and numbers before and after the disease for a period of years to get a baseline.For example, one might detect a spike in overall deaths for Mar/Apr/May 2020, but also see a decline in causes of deaths from pneumonia, cancer, heart failure from 2019 or 2021.  So COVID can be the cause of the spike, but would it also cause a decline in other mortality?  Food for thought.  But that‚Äôs just the White person in me being foolish.  ;-(

        There is still one more transition to go: once the party feels completely secure in its power it will likely put the leftist agitating on ice and focus on stability of its power. We wont need people burning the cities down when theres no need to consolidate power anymore. Maybe theyll allow the occasional riot as a reminder of their glorious revolution but it will all be ceremony by that point.America is powerful, but what remains to be seen for me is if after making this transition, America can go toe to toe with more ethnically homogenous powers like China indefinitely. It will depend on how the process of stabilizing power goes over the next 5 to 10 years.Even then demographics could be a ticking time bomb. As a minority, whites will continue to outbreed lowering their numbers further than the absurdly low fertility already is. Can we remain a superpower with continually dwindling amounts of europeans? Idk. But at the very least these shifting demographics means the stabilization of power will probably never be complete. The party is going to have to keep adjusting to the changing demographic reality over time and so now that I think about it i see a potential for slow decline to 2nd place and possibly beyond. But that could take as much as one or two generations at least.

            There‚Äôs certainly something to that. But they‚Äôve gotten where they are by promising ‚Äúfundamental transformation‚Äù. They‚Äôve got a huge fraction of the nation‚Äîespecially among the younger cohort‚Äîpumped up to bring that transformation about. It would be very difficult for the elites to tamp that down.

                These revolutions are created, encouraged, and financed by ‚Äúthe system‚Äù or the ruling class. They promised them fundamental change only to get them into the streets but the point is these revolutionary movements like BLM have no power outside of what the ruling class gives it.BLM is a great way for the ruling class to push their agenda further and consolidate power further but revolutionary movements go from useful to threatening to the ruling class once they have served their purpose. All it would take to stop BLM is to cut their funding, sever their networks, stop making their websites for them, even crush them with hard power if necessary. And they will, because theyve already shown they can and will do whatever it takes to remove even minor threats to their status quo. Promises mean nothing to power and without the resources and blessing of the system itself no group can even begin to effectively organize let alone make changes. Like i said, my money is on groups like this existing in a ceremonial way. Once the revolution is complete you will kniw because these groups will no longer cause any meaningful change to the system.

            Is Brazil a super power? Is China concerned about Mexico‚Äôs dominance? What about Haiti? Zimbabwe?The elites must be really stupid to do this, or they purposely want to destroy the USA.If one believes that demographics are destiny, the USA is destined to lose its superpower status.In fact any country that remains relatively homogenous will maintain prosperity. Estonia will be wealthier than Sweden in a few generations. Russia will be more powerful than the former USA.

                Yep, the U.S. will fade as a superpower due to demographics. We simply won‚Äôt have the money nor the capable manpower. What‚Äôs more, blacks and Hispanics don‚Äôt care about China. Even whites don‚Äôt care about China nor should we.The point of a government is to protect its people. The U.S. govt utterly failed to protect its people. In fact, it allowed and facilitated an invasion of other peoples. Let the whole thing die.

                Personally I dont think they had a choice. In order to destroy the entire Western world all at once required first massive ideological indoctrination but then massive ‚Äúbio‚Äù power. Without importing other people, there was a very strong and ever present threat to power through democracy, however tepid and ineffectual it may be you can only do electroal shenanigans for so long before you risk revolution.It may be a great irony then that the strategy they needed to use of importing nrw voters may ultimately be their downfall from power because at some point the burden and inefficiencies of it will have to become too much. Maybe theres a way to make it work but I cant see it.Brazil is a great example. It is okay for Brazil to be Brazil because it was never a superpower anyway. Brazil as a white minority ruled multiethnic country is stable. The US is the heart of the empire. If it goes the way of Brazil there will not be stability it will tear down the entire neoliberal order across the west. At that point anything is possible.

                Yeah the control over institutions took place long ago. The trap was set this is just them springing it. Imo they saw the election of Trump and other events as proof that their power wasnt unchallenged. They are moving things along further and faster now to shut down any potential threat to power, i think they really are scared an adult will step in and rally the people to bring back sanity before its too late.

            This has all the earmarks of a cultural revolution in the China model.  Corporate America is terrified, social media will destroy lives, and now even STEM fields in good colleges, the news organs are speaking with one voice, mass vandalism is now permitted..As seen on twitter:  The Cultural Revolution in China didn‚Äôt end until Mao sent in the Army to arrest the Red Guard and throw them into either prisons or work camps on farms.Anyone seeing Trump (or anyone) doing that, here?I can‚Äôt believe this is happening in my lifetime.  It‚Äôs a no kidding Communist push; if there is a ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù, they‚Äôve been pushing for this for 50+ years, and they seem to be pushing quite hard now.

                The ruling elite is backing the American Red Guards, all right. Today I drove past a public high school (financed by tax money). The official electric sign, which used to announce graduation ceremonies and such, was flashing: BLM.The Powers are either convinced they no longer have to hide their heavy hand, or are desperate to make the final mop-up. More likely the former ‚Äî they‚Äôve pretty much crushed all public criticism of the Great Cultural Revolution, so why worry? But the wicked flee when no man pursueth.

Eventually, once hollowed out from within, even the German running the legions couldn‚Äôt sustain belief in ‚ÄúRome‚Äù.

                        I believe we are pulling tritium from weapons, reconditioning it, then using it to reload depleted tritium weapons.  This is a temp fix since we have so many weapons to spare.  Not sure where the project to make home grown tritium is at this stage.  But the British are shutting down their reactors that make our supply soon.  Pretty sure however, it is a fairly high priority.  Oddly, it was Obama who worked with Congress to update our stock pile of nukes. Never could figure out why.

                            That is what I think as well. This does mean lower reliability and continuous decline in the stockpile size though.Roughly by the numbers,  the crisis started in 2013 so by 2025 (5 years from now) assuming no new tritium we have half the nukes we had in 2013 and by 2032, 25%This assumes no outside tritium and maximally efficient recovery.This should be enough decline to reduce the risk of a declining or dying empire spite nuking someone while retaining enough to protect us from PRC invasionAs far as Obama‚Äôs attempted fixes,  people in his cabinet told him it was needed and so he did it.

            One optimistic thing about a possible military coup in the USA: whatever its ideological faults, the military is made up of the better half (30% actually) of the population. We may end up being ruled by authoritarian dictators, but at least they‚Äôll have mostly competent people in power.It‚Äôs sobering to know that (rounded up for non-test-takers) about 20% of whites, 35% of browns, and 50% of Blacks are too stupid to even qualify even for infantry or marines. These standards have been in place many decades. And many of the ones who do pass are definitely not the brightest lights in the harbor. I now realize ‚Äúthe few, the proud‚Äù was no exaggeration.https://observer.com/2018/08/pentagon-most-americans-are-too-fat-stupid-to-enlist-in-the-military/

        The most recent Third Rail podcast (#156) described a good method for beginning to budge any normiecon friends or family our way if they‚Äôre not completely happy with the St. George bullshit but are still struggling to take their own (white) side.This method won‚Äôt work on leftist friends or family, but if you know people whoaren‚Äôtcompletely happy with the current narrative, the Third Rail recommended pointing out that blacks are not oppressed, but rather pampered:In the entirety of human history, no oppressed people have EVER drawn closer to, followed or pushed into their oppressors. The first thing an oppressed people want to do is FLEE their oppressors, and human history has shown this over and over again.Yet since the 1960s, the only things blacks have done is push into white space: they constantly cry oppression, yet at the same time they incessantly move to white neighborhoods and insist on preferential inclusion in white institutions and organizations. No truly oppressed people would ever do this‚Äîthey would take every opportunity to get as far away from their oppressors as possible, and shun every institution and organization of their oppressors as well.White people, and white cops especially, take every opportunity to avoid blacks, yet the latter constantly inject themselves into the white world and make nuisances and liabilities of themselves even as whites do every desperate thing possible to avoid confrontation.

        We all know the truth behind this.¬†It‚Äôs not about racism, or inequality. The disadvantages in life for certain groups will not be magically wiped away once the statues, plaques, monuments and history books are properly scrubbed. They tell us this is to reveal the ‚Äútruth‚Äù or to be more ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù of what America is supposed to represent.No. This is a systematic design to erase a people‚Äôs history, culture and legendary figures from our past. To shame us and disgrace prior achievements till all pride in our ancestors is vanquished.Ask yourself these questions: Why? Who gains from these actions? Where does this stop? What is the logical conclusion to this process? Which figures are NOT being scrutinized from our history for elimination?Confederate figures today, sandblasting Mt. Rushmore tomorrow? Banning certain media such as movies, books, websites and personalities that are considered on the wrong side of history? Who granted them the eternal moral authority to decide?

        Of course, by the time Athens was defeated in the Peloponnesian War, its internal politics were such a shambles that generals were being appointed by rival political parties in the hope that they would lose, its alleged ‚Äúallies‚Äù hated it, and its finances were exhausted by an enormous unproductive bureaucracy; a power in such straits was bound to lose to someone very soon, its defeat was as close to being a foregone conclusion as anything can be, Sparta just happened to be their major antagonist when it happened. When this thing starts to go, it‚Äôs going to go faster than anyone imagined possible. As C.V. Wedgewood said about the Holy Roman Empire, the US is lumbering from crisis to crisis, each time righting itself with more difficulty. I‚Äôd be willing to bet that almost everyone reading this now will live to see it happen.And, oh, yeah, Athens was also ravaged by a plague, almost certainly brought in by refugees and Athens‚Äô global trading economy. Stop me if this is starting to sound familiar.

        The defeat of America will ultimately be economic. The US Dollar being the reserve currency and, to a lesser extent, our military and our arms industry along with oil priced in Dollars are what gives America her power and Americans their standard of living.  It is the world‚Äôs job to produce stuff and it is our job to consume those products and have parties.  A pretty good gig if you can get it.Our military is a paper tiger. Basically, none of our military equipment can be replaced in real time in a war. Even the weapons made in the US are not being made entirely from American produced raw materials. If an aircraft carrier were sunk, it would take America years to replace it.The military production of the 1940s is staggering. The US built over 100 aircraft carriers in about 5 years. America built over 65,000 planes in about 6 years. America made hundreds of millions of bombs. Everything about armaments in the 40s was done at a staggering scale that blows the mind. At the end of this orgy of death and destruction, we had most of the gold and most of the world‚Äôs production assets.We enjoy a standard of living that we could not possibly generate for ourselves.

            I doubt any country prepares for a war and assumes production of major equipment after the fact.  Even those damn cruise missiles, all made here at Raytheon take a long time. We have what we need if the war planned for is quick and there‚Äôs a lot of somewhat obsolete stuff in reserve, for example Abrams Tanks.  Like 8000, last I read, parked in the middle of the desert.In Tucson, we have the airplane boneyard, which is really a misnomer.  The planes are mothballed and ready to be placed into service if needed.  That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find lots of stuff still flying elsewhere.  B1‚Äôs, Warthogs, even B52‚Äôs.  We pull them out and refurbish as needed to replace totaled aircraft in service.But you are essentially correct.  The best defense is a strong economic base should a war come about.  WWII‚ÄîI read in a book I lost somewhere‚Äîwas precisely that example.  The Great Depression at the start of WWII had left over 30% of our industrial capacity idle, along with a goodly number of employees.  Just that idle capacity for production was larger than all of the Axis war powers production capacity combined.  In essence, the war was lost by them the minute we joined in.  After the first year, the rest was basically mopping up.  There were no major victories for the Axis powers, only measured retreat.

        Maybe a still better analogy is Carthage.  After two centuries of exceptionalism that peaked with our mighty war elephants (nuclear armaments) we have been conquered by the Poz and our earth salted with the global detritus of the southern hemisphere.  We will become a desert wasteland of almost zero future relevance beyond resource extraction.  About us, people will laugh derisively in order to avoid weeping at our history.  When the left chants Black Lives Matter, what they really mean is America delenda est.

        Here‚Äôs the American Empire in all its glory. During the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù cops were busy harassing peaceful white people on park benches, yet just a few weeks later thevery same copsare nowhere to be found when blacks are assaulting whites on thevery same benches:https://twitter.com/TheyCallMePiatt/status/1271110697049612288https://twitter.com/RNRMaryland/status/1270793786067689473I used to be on the fence about ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù because even in the biggest most hellish diversitopias the cops represent some of the last vestiges of working class white people. But except for maybe cops in rural and small town areas, most of these guys will protect and serve only their pensions.Another case in point was when that black rioter in Portsmouth, Virginia was brained by the statue it was tearing down. The cops stood by and watched, but as soon as the other rioters called out ‚Äúmedic!‚Äù the cops rushed in to help the Darwined rioter.It‚Äôs clear now the cops can go. Defund and seize their pensions too.

            You must live in a peaceful area.  When police react in a way that is anti-public good‚Äîas however one defines that, you correct that behavior.  If the corruption is deep, you might start all over again.    But how one in this society does without a police force needs to be explained to me somewhat more in detail.As to their pensions, that is a general problem with public employees and weak political administration, not really a police problem in particular.  The problem as I see it, being worse in blue States than red States.  One good correction is to not allow retirement collection before a min age, like 55 or 62.  Way too many cops, work 20 in one agency, then ‚Äúretire‚Äù only to work another 20 in another agency therefore collecting two pensions in their early 60‚Äôs‚Äîone of which they‚Äôve been getting since their 40‚Äôs.

        The endgame for our current situation is the ‚Äúgibs‚Äù.  The lockdowns and the ‚Äúfree‚Äù monthly cash payouts are welcomed by a lot of people, especially the young adults, who see all of this as some sort of birthright.  They love getting paid for not going to work.  Even the looters are rationalizing their take as ‚Äúit‚Äôs all insured‚Äù.  In a few months, the free gibs run out, just in time for the elections.

        I don‚Äôt consider America an empire. Empires are military and political. America‚Äôs hegemony, if you want to call it that, is overwhelmingly economic and cultural. So, unless you redefine empire, America doesn‚Äôt qualify. But, whatever you want to call it, it‚Äôs clearly at the last ditch. What will push America over the edge is multiple massacres of innocent whites in white neighborhoods or peaceful gatherings of whites. It will take atrocities of this sort to jolt white people out of their suicidal slumber. And they will happen.

        Z, this was a good post. It‚Äôs actually a lot better than the typical ‚ÄúAmerican Empire Bad‚Äù essays that tend to come out of Europe, like this one:https://unherd.com/2020/06/covid-has-exposed-america-as-a-failed-state/While the linked essay was a very interesting read, it also revealed why Americans have traditionally been dismissive and suspicious of European academics. As good as it was, essays like the linked example tend to regurgitate tropes like ‚Äúxenophobia,‚Äù ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù and ‚Äúimperial policing‚Äù without understanding that these signs of decay are not caused by imperial overreach, but simply by diversity. White America doesn‚Äôt have a gun violence problem, for example; only black America does. Remove black Americans and gun violence in the US would be at about the same level as in the Czech Republic.For all the essay‚Äôs length, it never admitted the underlying problem: that the American Empire is failing simply because it got too diverse, as all empires do. Ethnic conflicts and tensions rise wherever there is diversity, not because of ideological hangups, poor economic conditions or class inequality. Homogenous societies with poor economic conditions, ideological blinders, and structural inequalities‚Äîlike the essay‚Äôs much-lauded China‚Äîhave always been able to sustain themselves for centuries despite those problems due to their homogeneity.There are so many ‚Äúrightist‚Äù intellectuals from abroad who are so thoroughly inculcated in the antiracism religion that they tend to blame imperial decline on all sorts of abstract issues‚Äîlike the supposed problem of ‚Äúliberalism‚Äôs manifest destiny‚Äù discussed in the essay‚Äîwhen the real problem is simply diversity. Unwilling to address issues of race and ethnicity, most intellectuals are unable to comprehend that America is simply just another Yugoslavia on the eve of civil war.

        There‚Äôs actually a lot of parallels between America and the Roman Empire.Beginning with the fact that both were founded as Pirate Bay‚Äôs ‚Äì and retained that dna throughout their history.Moving in to the fact that both grew exponentially by absorbing neighboring and conquered peoples.Which meant that neither was ever a unified people ‚Äì a nation.  Instead they were both fractured societies held together for various reasons ‚Äì originally exinstential threats from neighbors.  Later internal threats and the financial prospect of conquest.When Rome defeated their prime nemesis ‚Äì Carthage ‚Äì in the 2nd century by and were the most powerful country in the Mediterranean world, they began to tear themselves apart and entered a period of prolonged internal wars lasting almost a century and a half.  The only thing that pulled them together was more conquests ‚Äì unnecessary wars ‚Äì and even those offered temporary respites.The point of comparison between the US today and the Roman republic would be a decade after their defeat of carthage ‚Äì and were sliding into their first round of extended civil wars ‚Äì hot and cold.

        One of your best posts.I would note the problem of the elites is keeping the food and water flowing to the masses during the latter chapters of ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù.  Let Eddie Die.  (sorry if you decide to be Eddie).Those maps of counties or precincts show Galt‚Äôs Gulch in red.The madness would end in a month or two if the power pylons and/or the water systems were interrupted.  And that isn‚Äôt something that takes much effort.Out here, 1. No one would bother, or be able to get near.  2. We‚Äôre preppers, and it would be a moderate inconvenience and we might have to pay more attention to our gardens and livestock.Its nice to be hundreds of miles from the madness.  Even nicer to know where and how to block the roads to keep them on the far side of the interevening mountains.  The few who can survive might be salvagable.Lagos won‚Äôt suddenly die of some kind of heart attack.  Like Atlas Shrugged where there was Tomato Juice because Orange Juice was cut off it will be a slow strangulation.  But you will suffocate, and might notice it has become harder to breathe each day.

        They say the ‚ÄúFounding Fathers‚Äù paid special attention to the fate of Ancient Rome. They wanted to write the constitution in such a way as to avoid Rome‚Äôs descent into tyranny, thus the ‚Äúbalance of powers‚Äù we make so much about. Never mind that the Romans had a highly-developed republican system also with its own balance of powers. Their republic lasted longer than ours ever will.That chapter (ours) hasn‚Äôt been written yet, but maybe we did get Athens instead of Rome. That would be just like history, in avoiding one fate, we get another just as bad if not worse.What seals our own fate is the totalitarian nature of the hydra-headed corporate monster. Our current corporate masters (and most of those who serve them) all think alike because of the triumph of the Leftists‚Äô Long March Through The Institutions, which in particular took over our educational system from top to bottom without Conservatism, Inc. seeming to raise much of a alarm. That system has trained ‚Äî or should I say indoctrinated ‚Äî our current leaders from a very young age.You know it‚Äôs bad when you have a Phi Beta Kappa holder asking you what you mean by ‚Äúbread &amp; circuses,‚Äù as has happened to me. Part of the problem is the STEM fields themselves which tend to attract the conservative temperament. They train competent technicians but they don‚Äôt train the mind broadly. And then on the other end of the scale, degrees are created in contentless ‚Äúcritical studies‚Äù fields and their precursors the ‚Äúeducation‚Äù degrees, and we‚Äôre supposed to pretend they have value. Like a lot of other nonsense we‚Äôre supposed to pretend. We are revolutionaries by necessity simply for telling the truth. George Orwell said it was a revolutionary act to simply tell the truth under such a regime, but don‚Äôt remember his exact words.

                Yep, but at least in Sparta, the Helots were mastered by their superiors or betters. Now we are mastered by our inferiors. The result is the same‚Äîslavery‚Äîbut perhaps more shameful in our case. Much more shameful.

        I dunno, Z.This column has flashes of brilliance interspersed with a few clinkers.First, I do not think that a comparison with Rome is as trite as you make it sound. The Founders actively patterned this country on the Roman Republic. For God‚Äôs sake, the pseudonym of Madison and Hamilton in the Federalist Papers was ‚ÄúPublius Publicola.‚Äù They created a Senate, and a House that was similar in concept to the tribunes.That being said, the comparison with remains Athens useful ‚Äî for post-Lincoln America, anyway. What is NATO today if not the Delian League? How is the bombing of Belgrade different from the attack on Melos ‚Äî ‚Äúthe strong do what they will, the weak do what they must‚Äù?But if we are to be compared to Athens, it is not true that we don‚Äôt know how this ends. We do ‚Äî Book 8 of Plato‚Äôs Republic predicts that democracy invariably degenerates into tyranny.Bank on it.

        The Athenians were really bad at keeping their empire together.  As soon as any of Athens‚Äôs tributary allies took a vote and decided not to pay the tribute, Athens would take a vote to kill all the men and sell the women and children into slavery.  Not a formula for a lasting / growing empire.Even without the Spartans,  Athens would have quickly reached the point where too many small states hated them and were willing to make common-cause to smash the empire.  Rome, and U.S. were far more benevolent to their conquered populations.

        America IS being conquered from the outside so if the Athens analogy was to work it would end with Athens being swamped with Persians, Egyptians, Assyrians, you name it, all invited in by the Athenian democracy. I think Rome is a better analogy for that. Rome, like America, did not (at first anyway) suffer a crushing military defeat like Athens did.What is happening in the world right now does not just involve America or the West but also the non-Westerners flooding into the promised lands. Was Athens overrun with alien migrants at the end? Maybe not b/c it was chastised by its defeat to Sparta. Maybe that defeat was a blessing in disguise, a sorely needed reality check.To find useful historical analogies to today I would really start with Glubb. In the age of decadence he saw that entertainers replaced explorers, inventors, generals and other ‚Äòdoers‚Äô as the celebrities of society, that it became all about making money, not doing ‚Äògreat things‚Äô, that women were promoted in public life and that frivolity and pessimism overtook the public mood. This happened with the Assyrians, Romans and in Baghdad during Islam‚Äôs golden age. It probably also happened in Athens. Patterns of N&gt;3 are more powerful analogies than single cases. What we are seeing is the phase where decadence starts to transition to the collapse phase and here, in the Western canon (China and India have their own versions), the fall of Rome is the most well-known and perhaps largest known case.

        This is a society that bans books, throws men in jail for their politics and has created a form of internal exile for those found to be guilty of impiety.Not arguing the part about books being banned and I have read of people in jail solely due to their politics. Iwould, however, like an example of internal exile. Not arguing,mind you, just wanting an illustration.Maybe the end of history is what we are seeing today replayed over and over forever.DAMN! but I hope you are wrong on this.

            to be fair, Zman did notice the conservatives were better during that anti-lockdown struggle than the secular HBDissidents that wanted to believe the Science of Blessed Cochran and Sailer, and thought once proven right on mass coronadeaths they‚Äôd be proven right on the bell curve and buy books from C-C‚Ä¶ except, not.you can‚Äôt trust people who only believe in matter, as matter is much more easily bent and twisted around ‚Äì specially brain matter hoarding purely material truths.now, if conservatives counterprotested against CHAZ and BLM just as hard as against lockdowns and gun-taking, they would conserve even more of not just their genes (which can always be miscegenated without proper guidance) but also more of worthy divine and natural tradition. which is what conservatives want‚Ä¶ right? so it is good to call them out now and remind them of their values and the genes that both build them and are shaped by them (talking about the normiecons that won‚Äôt do anything Fox News doesn‚Äôt say, not the fewer based cons that are now in Seattle facing the hordes), just as it was good to extol their virtue resisting the plandemic lockdowns while the secular dissidence trusted the Science false god.

        good. very nietzchean ending, but kinda true. until, the last final spasm, the one before the Judgement.then again, idk, the obligatory chipping for the obligatory plandemic‚Äôs vax isn‚Äôt off the table yet. so who knows. this is an unseen level of power and control the oligarchs wield, and will do so fully soon. it will be slow though. but who knows. perhaps we will be delivered to the hordes for our sins.specially that of false pride, when we claim to be a nation that defends itself by being safe and welcoming and democratic and spreader of democracy (?!), yet has pretty much allowed a paris-style commune in Seattle and outright race-class warfare in some urban areas, while the military is still outposted in many areas of the world ‚Äúkeeping it safe for democracy‚Äù (and Zionists), all while the nation‚Äôs middle to lower class men pretty much have to learn to code and hope for the best under corporate femcentric multiracial environments that will just turn them evermore docile and/or single.

        The people at the top use to ensure that bread and circuses continued, but that‚Äôs all stopped now. The Corona virus has proven that they don‚Äôt care to crash the economy, and it‚Äôs also shut down the circus, at least until ANTIFA fired up. I‚Äôve always said that the U.S. hangs on as long as the checks keep coming, but this is the first time I‚Äôve seen the bureaucracy actually play games with those checks.

        War, real industrial war, with China, can yet save us. Consider what would happen if China invaded Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, at the same which it is capable of (they don‚Äôt have sealift but they do have gigantic airlift ‚Äî their domestic airliner capacity). And then hit Guam with a barrage of missiles some nuclear. And then even had a paratrooper operation to seize Hawaii and took some of Alaska, perhaps with aid from Russia?With carriers sunk and battle groups lost and perhaps even NYC, Chicago, LA, Seattle and Portland all nuked besides DC?What then?War, real brutal meat-grinder industrial war requires White MEN. Not soyboys, not power-grrrrl Lesbians, not Dindus, nor Pajeets, nor Karens and the like. White men. White men to build the weapons. White men to use the weapons. White men to command the men using the weapons.Just think of it ‚Ä¶ what Beta Males are made for. A giant meatgrinder. But better than peace. Better than a permanent labor camp from which White men never leave. After all, Apple, Nike, and the like need cheap high IQ labor (Africans and Halfricans can‚Äôt assemble Iphones) and the key to that equation of massive profits is CHEAP and HIGH IQ. Relocating to Wakanda is not in the cards. But imagine every White man in a camp, worked to death. For glorious profits for the Colors of Benetton.Compared to THAT future War looks mighty damn good. If we are lucky it can last generations and lead to every White woman being what they were in 1700 ‚Äî limited rights and certainly not given much role in society besides wife and mother and prostitute. Dindus would be deported as a war time necessity. Same with Pajeet. Hispanics respond to leadership so there is that ‚Äî whoever is strongest is who they back.All I am saying is, give War a chance. Peace is over, if you want it.

        The future as eternal Groundhog Day?  Now there‚Äôs a depressing thought.  I doubt it.My guess is that the decadent American empire and soon-to-be-decadent Chinese empire will both be overthrown by a religiously-driven culture.  Religion gives a culture faith in the future, a reason to reproduce (ensuring demographic victory) and the confidence to be aggressive and suffer to achieve its goals.Given those guidelines, I would bet on a new Caliphate.  Maybe not this century, but latest the next one.

            I suspect the  future leads to the historical norm with no great powers and probably hundreds more nations.It will not be a Caliphate as Islam is too  prone to decadence and disorder in differentiating measures. Saudi Arabia is basically a time bomb waiting to happen and Iran, while an actual theocracy is sicker than we are.Now religious people will be the winners, using the US as a example. the highest fertility rate in the US is the Amish who if their fertility continues at current levels will be the majority people in the US from a mere 10,000 not long ago.Have 7 kids to adulthood double your population every twenty years and while it won‚Äôt stay that way for the Amish, only religious people have kids therefore the only people will be religious.Longer term prediction are impossible but if I  were to hazard a guess I‚Äôd suggest over the next hundred years we will lose most of our tech base and decline to somewhere like 1900 or so with some higher tech  knowledge but limited energy and complexity.

            ‚ÄúPpl who keep predicting and awaiting the collapse of america are going to be waiting a long time‚ÄùI respectfully disagree. Given current trends, it‚Äôs not going to take  a rival of comparable strength or ruthlessness, a mid-range power will be able to do it. Like Athens, America will be its own worst enemy. It may have taken such a rival to have defeated America in 1955, or 1985, or even 2001, but that‚Äôs no longer true. As you can probably tell, this is not your father‚Äôs United States.

            That‚Äôs just it. Collapse from the rot within; not conquest by the Mongols on the horizon. America tolerates, nay welcomes enthusiastically, the dregs of humanity because even those from the lowest economic and social class who are of European extraction can‚Äôt be bothered to mow their lawns, butcher their meat or raise their children. We have become a nation of spoiled children who consider poverty to be having a used car or anything other than the most recent iteration of the Iphone. The pioneer spirit that defined America in the 19th century and so attracted the white European immigrants has been utterly lost.  And so it is time once again to cowboy up.

                Cowboy up? What does that mean? Are we all supposed to raise our own cattle in our backyard, slaughter them in our apartment, and freeze the meat in our basement? While taking time out to fix our car, rewire the house‚Äôs electrical system, upgrade the plumbing, and plant and weed a vegetable garden?I don‚Äôt want to belabor the point, but frankly, I am tired of calls to become expert in every trade and Do It Yourself. Some people just don‚Äôt have the temperament and prefer mental work. If an individual enjoys improving skills in a few areas, great. But demanding everyone cowboy up ‚Äî incidentally, in the real Old West, many people followed professions instead of leading cattle drives ‚Äî is unrealistic, a utopian concept similar to the leftist insistence that everybody can benefit from a college education.Wedon‚Äôt have to be as anti-intellectual and irrational as our benighted junior radicals.

            (this is not investment advice but one man‚Äôs opinion) Real assets but not necessarily real estate.  Especially in places like CA.  Real estate is regional and spotty.  Obviously a 95% white area in a vastly white state would have a natural premium.  I‚Äôm a commodities oriented guy myself, particularly energy.  There‚Äôs a phenomenal podcast, MacroVoices, that has great guests, is very buttoned down, has a smart host who gives great advice.  I would start there.  It‚Äôs not investing 101, but a reasonably smart person can follow along.https://www.macrovoices.com/Stay away from CNBC scum, as a matter of fact do the opposite of what they say.

                    Look, when I said take profits yesterday, it was tongue in cheek.  But obviously it wouldn‚Äôt have been a bad idea.  Day trading is for suckers.  Yeah, you might hit a winner here and there or maybe even get on a hot streak, but unless you‚Äôre willing to put a lot of time and effort into it, eventually you‚Äôll flame out.  You‚Äôre best off putting the bulk of your liquid investable assets in quality dividend paying stocks ‚Äì admittedly a little tougher with the economy semi FUBAR ‚Äì and good growth companies in tech and perhaps healthcare.  The market has had a hell of a run since 3/23, totally Fed induced.  Where we go from here is anyone‚Äôs guess, but we‚Äôre in the historically weak six months of year, market performance-wise.  When you start reading about guys claiming to be knocking it dead day trading, watch out ‚Äì very reminiscent of 1999-2000 when the dotcom bubble blew up and took the know-it-all‚Äôs down with it.  Keep some powder dry.

            Invest in anything with a defense contract with the Gov. And WAIT. The market is collapsing right now. If you were smart, you just made a little money off that last wave and you‚Äôre readying your cash when the prices bottom out.

            Yes, thanks for asking. Stop day trading. Buy stocks with good dividend yieldsat good prices, usually when they‚Äôre down. Keep a bunch of cash to take advantage of market debacles like today‚Äôs. Hold some gold in the Perth Mint ETF, ticker AAAU.There can be no guarantees, but your long-term odds will be better than by day trading and you will need to spend less time managing your investments.
