        The barbarians are here, but I’m not sure of the scenarios put out by writers who claim that it will be chaos due to the ‘EBT card-Section 8 Funding-Miscellaneous Free Stuff’ being cut off. They envisage some form of Madmax, but I think that’s unlikely. We already have Mini-Madmax in the colored infested cities, but it is in slow motion.I think that the colored people will be catered to first, as they are catered to now. It is all of us Whites that will be thrown under the bus, because we don’t riot. We just sit and take it, with a lot of moaning and complaining and outrage, but no action.The PTB are very smart and seem to be following The Coudenhove-Kalergi plan. Here’s a snippet and a link to this non-conspiracy theory right from good old wikipedia, and one other. There are other sources if you care to google it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nikolaus_von_Coudenhove-KalergiWIKI- from the section ‘Views on race and religion’:“The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today’s races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.”Another source:http://www.westernspring.co.uk/the-coudenhove-kalergi-plan-the-genocide-of-the-peoples-of-europe/

        […] …The Romans never figured out how to make an orderly retreat from empire. They exhausted themselves financially and culturally trying to keep the empire together, eventually leading to collapse. America is not about to be invaded by Visigoths. Collapse is unlikely, but a very painful and disruptive reordering is on the horizon. The question is how painful and orderly.” —The Z Man […]

            I’m reading Steven Saylor’s “Roma Sub Rosa” series- fun stuff. I had already read Collen McCullough’s “Masters of Rome” books and quite enjoyed them. I suppose I should read some real History of the period….

                Skip the “real history,” the real history is in good historical fiction. The spaces in between the facts are what really matter, and they’re all imagined.

        I think we are kinda being invaded by the Visigoths- except we’re paying them to invade us.
