        The average Joe and Jane totally understand that before ISIS, Al Qaeda, China, Russia, Castro, Boko Haram or Iran can or will destroy the USA, unlimited, open immigration  (as we have right now) will get the job done first.
IMHO that is the main reason Trump is, so far anyway, leading the field.

            The alternative to Trump winning is Democrat whomever. Trump has opened people’s eyes to the GOP complicity in immigration/low-wage/foreign-worker policy. Once you believe someone’s sold their country for $$$, there’s no chance voting for them. It’s Trump or stay home.

        Just a quick note: The “Jerry Falwell” who endorsed Trump isn’t THE Jerry Falwell of Moral Majority fame. It’s actually his son, Jerry Fallwell Jr. Falwell Sr. passed away a few years ago.

        Did you know that the guy responsible for that Santorum win is in charge of the Trump campaign in Iowa? That’s why you are hearing that Trump’s ground game is not good. They are smart enough to keep their mouths shut about it

        If Rubio wins, he only does so because the non-Rubio vote was split between Trump and Cruz.  With that the case, I’m not convinced that a Rubio win means the CIC can declare victory.  All it would take would be for Trump and Cruz voters to consolidate behind one candidate, who would then have the majority of the support.
I think Trump and Cruz would fight it out for a while, but by Super Tuesday, one or the other would be vanquished and the survivor could go on to defeat Rubio.

                Nationalism IS the new Conservatism.  Conservative Inc. just hasn’t realized it yet.  If you wish to “conserve” American values, the first step is to make sure America retains it’s historical demographic composition.

                    I think that is very short sighted. I can think of several ideologies that aren’t conservative and I’m sure you can also.Yes, Trump may follow through with some of his border speeches (remember in 2006 when a fence was going to be built– leftist tied some of it up in court), but Trump is limited to how much he can use the executive branch,Meanwhile, many of his other proposals smack of increasing the regulatory state– very un-conservative.I’m thankful Trump had the courage to speak against unfettered immigration, but I think people shouldn’t have any illusions about what he will do making all those tremendous deals he’s so famous for.

                My read here is his internal polling showed he was not going to win so he throws this bomb thinking maybe it tempts Trump into responding. if not, he has a ready make excuse he can offer the purists. “I would have won if not for my principled stand on ethanol.”
My rule is as soon as I hear the word “principled” I hide my wallet.

                    Sounds right.  I have people in Iowa, and I see a lot of these type shenanigans.  If you wonder why the Rick Santorums, Michelle Bachmanns, and assorted other loons always seem to win there, the answer is “Jesus wants ethanol subsidies.”

                        Guess I was wrong about that one.  I wonder if that’ll change the dynamics in Iowa going forward — now you can tell the ethanol lobby to self-pleasure.  Naaaaahh… they’ll read this election as a one-off.  But still, one can dream.

                            Bibles &gt; subsidies in the Bible belt. Ted Cruz did everything but lay hands on the lepers in Iowa to win the church vote. They were willing to excuse his apostasy on other things as a result.
Looking at the vote totals and spending, Cruz spent about 20 million to get 1500 more votes than Trump. I think if I’m Team Trump, I’m feeling pretty good. If I’m Team Cruz, I’m really worried about New Hampshire. Rubio, of course, is out buy chaps.

            The funny thing is I have no thought much about who I would vote for if I had a vote. I think Bush should be sent into exile. Rubio is as dumb as a goldfish. Kasich was a guy I used to think was sensible, but then he lost his marbles. Tubby from New Jersey is just too ridiculous to be president. Trump’s personal style is not my thing, but I bet he is a fun guy to play golf with or have a drink with. Cruz has always given me pause. There’s just something devious about that guy. I can’t quite put my finger on it. I think when he trolled the Arab Christians by talking about Israel, he revealed a lawful evil quality that just worries me.I guess I’m just enjoying the show too much to have a rooting interest.

        Having a bisexual Cuban amnesty fanatic knock off the evil ones would be for them what Obama was for the other side of the managerial elite. Wednesday in Washington would be an unofficial holiday as the locals partied into the wee hours.

            When Rubio was 18 he flunked out of college and returned to Miami, where he was busted for cruising (Cruzing? Sorry). He then moved in with a guy he was busted with.  Several years later, that guy later was arrested for running a live gay porn website:http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/marco-rubios-childhood-friend-tied-to-miamis-most-infamous-gay-porn-case-8203133

                    If you wonder how the media managed to hide that, think of Margaret Trudeau, the mother of Justin and wife of Pierre Trudeau, having sex with ALL the Rolling Stones…Keith Richard was hauled out by the fuzz for heroin overdose but Margaret was hauled back to…Canada…Pierre then stuck her in a mental asylum, just like the KGB…
