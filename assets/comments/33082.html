        I know I’m preaching to the choir, but I can’t see a single way that Ukrainians would be worse off being ruled by Putin than by Victoria Nuland’s pet penis piano player and his handlers.
I’d give the whole thing to Putin and be done with it.

                Last time I saw news about it, Putin had banished Moscow’s naked gay ass parades toBelarus. Not what you’d guess, right? It sticks in my mind because the SLAVIC PRIDE rainbow flags being marched nudely through Minsk wereallin English, and I wondered how they got there. Based Lukashenko, bending over.
If Kiev becomes Russian again, it could take Minsk’s place as the regional homo preserve. Maybe Putin could designate it the imperial anus. Not much of a change. Barely an inch.
(Actually he’d fill it with Africans.)

        It’s hard to believe the retards in DC along with a few of their European minion lackey retards are actually itching to pull the nuke trigger – WTF?  The idea that hundreds of thousands of people along with beautiful European and Russian cites could be vaporized largely due to the US government bellicosity is as infuriating as it is depressing.  I’m still betting (at least hoping) much cooler heads somewhere will prevail.

        One of the greatest issues I had to deal with was acceptance of things as they are.
The neocons are a death cult. Their actions can’t be explained logically. They just want to watch the world burn and laugh with diabolic glee while it does.
I’m just hoping we avoid all of this before Jan. 20 and cooler heads can prevail.

            The logic in their actions is psychological warfare and fear as a means of societal control.For many decades they had the threat of global nuclear annihilation to use in order to silence dissent and justify billions and billions of dollars to defense contractors and “foreign aid”. That went away in the 1990s and for a brief period of time there was hope and optimism for the future.They couldn’t tolerate that, so they then demolished two towers and started the “Global War on Terror”. For close to two decades, Americans were told to submit lest they get killed by “Islamic” terrorists. They needed to have their balls fondled by low-iq humanoids every time they wanted to travel, just to remind them. Again, billions and billions of dollars got funneled to defense contractors and “foreign governments” (AKA, kick backs), and if you questioned any of it, well then you were a dangerous traitor who probably didn’t even like country music and freedom fries.When that eventually petered out, they went with a “deadly” “global” “pandemic”. I don’t think I need to detail the amount of money laundering and totalitarianism which was justified by that glorified cold virus which totally evolved naturally on its own.Literally the second that the world had moved beyond the Chinese Coof, suddenly Russia invades the Ukraine, and they have pivoted right back to the global nuclear annihilation playbook.And here we are. Hundreds of billions “for Ukraine”, and fear, fear, fear. It’s a highly-effective tactic. Even here amongst those of us who know better, the time spent discussing nuclear war is time *not* spent discussing congressional stock trading, Jeff Epstein, population replacement, election fraud, or the one particular trait most “Globalists” all have in common.

                The logic in their actions is psychological warfare and fear as a means of societal control.Spot on. The greed motivation is secondary, and those so inclined ( think the Cheneys) are exploited by the prospect of great wealth to get their buy-in and compliance. Social control indeed is the endgame although elements of shit-fling nihilism also are present. Ideological fanaticism and its related hatred are a far greater threat than greed. It has been obvious all along to me and many others that this easily could end in nuclear annihilation, and as these psychopaths see their Russian Great White Whale on the verge of casting off yet another harpoon, these last days will be increasingly horrific. If someone is predisposed toward prayer this is the time.

                Agreed more or less, with the exception that I do not know their motivation. Greed or power or malice or whatever. I can only guess what might be my motivation if I were one of them. Kind of a circular reference. If you assume they are acting out of an insane desire for power, then you conclude it’s about power. How would one go about establishing whether the initial premises were right?

                    I think all of us suffer from the fact that it’s very difficult for ordinary people, even those who are quite prosperous, to understand the thinking of those born to massive wealth, power, and privilege. I attended an “elite” prep school for a while as a kid and met some of these people’s kids. The first thing I noticed about them was how thoroughly nasty and mean they were. There’s something else though. They seemed somehow alien too. Like eventually, when they got a little older, they would “molt” and reveal the lizard-man underneath.I think a lot of the nihilism and pathology is due to the fact that these people are free to invent themselves. They don’t need to work or follow the expectations of any society other than their privileged peers. Some of them, as a result, go down some really dark and scary paths. Putting them in charge of the world means they may be able to take us there with them.You can say someone like Musk also has this same freedom and he’s not so bad. Musk, I think, is one who found a good path. He found hopeful, productive things to do with his life. He surrounded himself with good people and seems to have a positive morality. The problem is that you’re almost guaranteed to find a lot of privileged people choosing much darker paths.

Absolutely! 100% agreed. The scary thing is the internet does exactly the same for everyone. Or at least those who are not censored or punished for wrongthink.
There is no downside to being “thoroughly nasty and mean” on the internet because you can always get anothernom de plume.IP bans in a world of VPNs? Only stops the incompetent. Everyone else clicks on a free VPN.

                Good summation of the cryptocratic technicians and one facet of their psy-ops.
Ongoing fear, particularly in a feminized/feminist nation, is a guaranteed winnah.  Heck, you can trot out innumerable vast ‘n global hysterias and you got a built-in, pliable audience, ever-primed for it.
We can’t have forgotten Kovid Karen so soonly, can we?  With her double-masks, lockdowns, distancing, and cellophane around the children.  Oh, and the dancing nurses!  Damn, they were kinda ghoulish.

            When the election results came in I was quite relieved. I won’t say I was hopeful but I thought “well, at least there’s a chance now that things will get better.”. I’m now back to being incredibly anxious and just praying for Jan 20 to come and go without incident. The madmen still have almost 2 months though. Everyone was waiting for the other shoe to drop when Trump got elected. What will it be? Will they convict him of molesting a squirrel 30 years ago? Will they try to kill him again? Another impeachment? Sadly, I think they’re going for The Big Prize, the Ultimate Revenge against us all for putting OMB back in power. They will settle for nothing less than total global annihilation. If they have to live in a world ruled by OMB, they will just end that world. Game Over Man!Hopefully I’m wrong and this missile stuff is just the Biden regime taking a shit in the flower pot on the way out the door. Hopefully Trump’s people are busy “colluding” behind the scenes with Putler and telling him not to worry, just wait a bit and we can end this mess.

        As cute as Top Gun: Maverick was, in reality the roles are reversed. The stubborn brass are the pilots and the drone and missile advocates are the mavericks. Untold trillions have been pissed away on the janky F-35 and sitting-duck aircraft carriers while China and Russia developed asymmetric missile capability, conventional and nuclear. This was a logical response to our conventional aviation superiority. Now we’re in a new reality. So the lunatics in charge respond with provocations that would have gotten any president in our lifetimes impeached.

            You still need manned aircraft and the Russians’ fleet is no slouch. Carriers are not sitting ducks because they move and are not as easy to find as you’d think.Recon satellites do have gaps in coverage and if you’re trying to find a carrier task force with even a UAV, it’s going to be a very tough job if the task force goes dark (shuts down their radar and comms) and relies on external sensors, such as an E-2 Hawkeye, to keep up situational awareness.In the Cold War, the Soviets expended huge resources on reconnaissance aircraft designed to sniff out the location of our task groups using passive means (basically sniffing RF emissions passively) or actively (most of the Tu-95 Bears modified for recon had huge radars) and provide targeting data to Backfire and Blinder bombers carrying the deadly, fighter-sized AS-6 Kingfish missile, which could kill a carrier with even a conventional warhead.That’s why tactical doctrine put emphasis on killing the snoopers. We’ve gone back to that with the AIM-174, which brings back the long-range kill capability lost when the F-14 and its AIM-9 Phoenix missiles were retired by the Navy.These networked drones are absolute murder against tanks, fixed targets and heck, even individual soldiers. The modern land battlefield is one dangerous place now.But the open sea is not going to be friendly to these kinds of small UAVs, which don’t have the range or the sensor cueing ability to find a target in millions of square miles of deep blue.Now if you launch those type of UAVs from a manned aircraft or a bigger UAV, now you’re talking.The way to counter a swarm attack is either with laser weapons or particle beams, both of which require more development time.

                    China’s brand new sub just sunk in port a couple months ago.  The Russian navy has been neglected for decades.At the moment, the US still has naval supremacy.  Thus far, none of the carrier killers have actually killed any carriers.OTOH, I recon US naval supremacy would not survive contact with the Chinese in a war.  Our carriers may be technically better, but we simply cannot compete with numbers.   China has the capacity to build dozens of carriers in a short period of time.  The US needs longer than WW2 to build one (or 2 in parallel).  I seriously doubt Japan and South Korea are going to help with shipbuilding.  They likely do not want to lose their shipbuilding capability to Chinese missiles and bombs.

                        It’s not carriers that are the problem. It’s the fact the ChiComs would be the home team, with tons of aircraft at land bases. The DF-21 “carrier killer” ballistic missile doesn’t scare me, but being outnumbered 5-1 with ChiCom aircraft improving daily quality wise does.The big J-20 stealth fighter is likely not as good as an F-22 or F-35, but when you have twice as many of them as we have Raptors, it doesn’t have to be. It’s a big sucker that carries a lot of gas and weapons.The J-10, which is a single-engined non-stealthy fighter, is like an F-16 and the newer versions are as good as those jets.And lest I forget about the large number of twin-seat Sukhois the ChiComs bought from the Russians, which are the likely better equivalent of our Strike Eagles. Those things can carry a ton of ordinance a long way and are hell in a within visual range fight (dogfight).

                            I agree.  Quantity has a quality all its own.  As you mention, the fighting would be there, at least initially. Logistics would be way more difficult for us than for them.  While the carriers are nuclear, the aircraft need fuel.  The US had an enormous fleet of “oilers” in ww2 just to support all the fighting ships and their onboard aircraft.  These would be highly vulnerable.

I’d argue the carrier situation is even worse than you describe.
The US currently struggles to refit existing Nimitz-class boats in a timeframe shorter than WW2.
The attempt to outsource some of the carrier burden to the UK is looking like a total and complete failure because, after being unable to field F-35 air wings and replacing missile storage with treadmills, the UK MoD is seriously discussing scrapping both their carriers entirely.

                        With regard to the US Navy, we have morphed into the 1940 Japanese Navy.  We have a relatively large fleet without the ability to produce new ships quickly and repair damaged ships.  We also don’t have the ability to man any new ships that are added to the inventory.China, on the other hand, has the ability to rapidly produce ships and the repair facilities for damaged ships.This is the situation we faced in 1941,  we had a large fleet with an even  larger fleet under construction that would be in commission in 1943-1944.The peace dividend and gutting the manufacturing base in action.

                    That is so, but they have to be able to communicate that targeting data real time. If you float the comms buoy, you just ripped the loudest electronic fart in the elevator so to speak. Even if you use extreme low frequency transmissions (the TACAMO aircraft have 2-mile long antennas and must fly a very specific flight profile) that can penetrate the water column, those messages take 30 minutes to an hour to send because it comes in one character at a time.And you forget there are ALWAYS one or two of our submarines working with our task group. It’s an almost symbiotic relationship since the CVBGs act as a lure for opposing submarines and flush them out for our SSNs and the CVBG can protect its subs by shooting down any ASW planes stupid enough to fly near it.

                    The Eisenhower, despite reports, was never hit by a missile and was likely never found by the Houthis. The Houthis lack over the horizon targeting, so I’m assuming they were just launching and hoping that the on-board sensors on the UAVs would find their targets.
I will agree that that spending $1 million per missile to shoot down a $10k drone is absurd.

                        then why did it leave station without dealing with the problem it was sent to deal with?  why is the red sea still a choke point?
i would say either scenario is possible given what we know (and don’t know).

Something is definitely going on with the carriers operating near the Red Sea.
Didn’t theAbraham Lincolnalso recently pull back to the Indian Ocean after coming under fire from the Houthis?

                            The problem with the Red Sea is there isn’t a lot of real estate there like in the Pacific where a big ship and its escorts can hide.
And there are other ways to do targeting data. Fishing boats are one.

Your comment about the task force going dark is exactly why that illegal Starlink network set up by vibrant senior NCOs to watch soap operas and sports was such a horrific idea.
Of course, those folks got nothing more than a slap on the wrist after endangering thousands of lives and billions of dollars of hardware.

                We dont need aircraft with pilots. We actually haven’t needed them for a while but UAVs and drones aren’t appealing to the big spenders in DC.  Pilots take up space and have weight penalties.  Their purpose could be automated and it could be done better.  If nothing else, fighter aircraft could be remotely piloted.  They could be much much cheaper and we could make more of them.   It’s only emotion and illogic that keep the cockpits occupied.

                    There is another, totally irrational reason for continuing to field manned aircraft, particularly single and twin-seat fighters.
I summarize this reason as the, “Knights Dueling in the Sky,” fantasy, which was borne out of the early days of air combat in WW1.
This fantasy has been successfully sold to most, even people who should know better, for over a century. It is most visible in big-time Hollywood films likeTop Gun.

        After Russia fired the long range missiles into Ukraine, I checked the major papers of record, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, to see if they were reporting on it, and if so, in what manner.  The Times had a brief story about the test midway down the home page, but the Post had nothing.  Shockingly, but not surprisingly, the Post was running yet another article claiming that the Russian military had experienced staggering losses in the war and was on the verge of collapse.  I didn’t click through to read their propaganda.  I’d like to think that cooler heads will prevail in this conflict, but the fact that our leaders and the leaders of Western Europe seem to only believe lies and propaganda about the state of the war has me really concerned.  Our leaders are so stupid and feckless that they may well escalate the conflict to the point where it involves all of Europe or goes nuclear.  I’d like to think that Trump will be able to deescalate what is quickly becoming an extremely dangerous situation, but again I’m not optimistic: if there’s one area that could sink his presidency, it will be foreign policy.

Yep, the propaganda in the media could have been written by the Uke’s the day before.  Interestingly, if these very large organizations simply sent a reporter to Moscow to ask the man in the street what he thought, they’d (if honest) not publish such crap.

        I know it is absolutely impossible today with the makeup of Congress, but passing a modern version of the mid 1930s Neutrality Acts would do much to restrain the lunatics as well as the power of the President to drag us into military action at will. But since Congress is owned by Bagels and Rayethon, Boeing etc., Getting Congress to curb the appetite for war is impossible.The 1935 act imposed a general embargo on trading in arms and war materials with all parties in a war.The Neutrality Act of 1936, passed in February of that year, renewed the provisions of the 1935 act for another 14 months.It also forbade all loans or credits to belligerents. (emphasis mine)Also great use of Iron Maiden in the title.

                Yeah, just as you couldn’t get a non-intervention law passed, you couldn’t get one enforced if that somehow happened. The residual memory of living with a semblance of the Rule of Law makes it easy to overlook there are no restraints any longer other than raw power.

            FDR simply had Congress pass the “Lend Lease Act” and the contradiction with the “Neutrality Act” was ignored.  Today, I doubt we’d even need to pass any type of “enabling” Act—we’d just do it and let the Courts sort it out after the fact and when it’s too late to do anything to reverse the damage done.

        I don’t know what a glide missile would be, but the Ukrainians say that the Oreshnik intermediate ballistic missile, and subsequently its 6 mirved warheads, hit Mach 11 on the descent, and those 6 warheads each mirved into 6 smaller warheads, so total 36..The effect was to penetrate into the below ground workshops and utterly destroy them, as observers on the scene have said…Simplicius has covered this event in elaborate detail…Yes, the West has no defense against such a weapon, which can reach even London in less than 20 minutes…This missile had conventional warheads, but it’s designed to carry nuclear warheads…

                Dr-This is absolutely a game changer.To field its current fleet of hypersonic weapons the Russians must have made multiple breakthroughs in materials science and thermal management.It reminds me of the scene in the old novel/Eastwood filmFirefoxwhere a council of Western officials are analyzing their intel and conclude that, “….the Firefox can sustain Mach 5 or 6…our best designs begin melting down at Mach 3…”Also, there is evidence that the Russians have figured out to communicate with their hypersonics through the plasma shield. There is a 2007 paper floating around about being able to modulate a signal using the plasma shield as some kind of transducer. The main authors had Russian family names.

            Didn’t the Russians already have subs that can hit London in less than 20 minutes? Or DC? I’m not seeing the big calculus change that everyone is talking about.

                I am sure no expert, but I would venture a thought: I think the calculus change is more symbolic than practical. The low orbit (fractional) aspect coupled with the glide capabilities renders detection and then interception essentially impossible. If we are in a new nuclear arms race, this missile is shockingly effective at bypassing putative air defenses.In practice, has anything really changed? Not too much. In theory, I guess it shows how antiquated we are and advanced the Eastern axis has become.

                Normal people know about submarines and ICBMs and shit, so “war nerds” don’t talk about them.If you say “glide vehicle” and nobody knows what the hell you’re talking about, you win the internet.We recently saw Germany defeated by a scuba dude with a knife in his mouth, but therealdanger is whatever new black hole in the budget the latest round of military journalism (advertising) is about. We should know better, being about a century into the same story: “The warring sides are held in stasis by knowing each other’s weapons (etc.) so well that all of them are useless. But the next invention will kill us all—if the Russians get it first!”The truth is exciting enough, you’d think: Here’s a list of psychos. Western foreign policy is whatever they want. For reasons almost entirely reducible to ‘ethnic animus,’ their main martial aim iseverybody dead. They appear to believe their own propaganda and consider themselves cornered right now, so they think they have tohurry.“Meh. It’s like a cartoon. I can’t finish without missile names.”

                It’s that while it is plausible to believe your government could detect and destroy enemy subs off your coast, they know it is not plausible to do the same to hundreds of scattered launch sites deep within Russia.

        Putin is holding all the aces and the West only has bellicose bluster and playing nuclear chicken as a fallback plan. Russia will not back down until its security requirements are obtained, and the best Trump can hope for in negotiation is some limited access to Ukraine’s resources after the smoke clears. Putin may agree to some token access in order to stop the killing, and let Trump save face, but then the West’s Central Banks begin to fail as loans default. Methinks the stolen 2020 election sealed our fate. Only collapse can cure what ails us.

            “Russia will not back down until its security requirements are obtained.” As things stand, it’s unlikely that those requirements will be satisfied, given that both Finland and Sweden (!) have joined NATO since the start of the war. NATO long ceased being a mutual defensive pact and has become a collection of puppet states in the GAE, exercising no more independence than the old Soviet “socialist republics”, all of whom had votes in the UN,  just as GAE’s imperial satrapies have today. NATO now boasts 32 member “states”, up from an original membership of 12 in 1949. This expansion has no other explanation than antipathy, not for the “Soviet threat” which disintegrated over thirty years ago, but for actual sovereignty generally, and for Russia in particular.I wish I were as confident as you are that Putin holds all the cards. I for one salute his forbearance.

                Dr., I suggest that explaining our enemies as a “death cult” obscures their true motivation. I doubt that they want their people and their servants to die, for example.
The state of the world is best explained by the assumption that that the primary goal of those who hold decisive power in the world is the dispossession of traditional whites, whether those whites live in Russia, Europe, or the USA.
It’s hard to believe but the elites would prefer to rule over a world of rubble in which traditional whites are immiserated rather than what has been before.

            If the treaty was being upheld by the Russians, 5 years from start to successful operations use is phenomenal for a weapons system such as this.  We’ve not seen something comparable since the Germans brought jet fighters into use in WWII.
This of course brings to mind what else the Russians have in store for us.  Specifically, if they’ve found a way to track and neutralize our Ohio-class submarine fleet—and how would we know until too late? At that point there would be no deterrent (MAD doctrine) from the West to prevent an all out “launch on detect” response.

                    On top of the poor weld quality, US shipyards lack capacity and are unable to find qualified personnel.
This is why we’ve seen so many recent articles about outsourcing shipbuilding to South Korea and Japan and what a great thing that would be.

            Probably for lots of them it’s because there hasn’t been any Truth and Reconciliation regarding the culmination of Epstein. I don’t think even WW3 can make people forget that and might even bring it more into focus in the end, but they don’t know what else to do.

        Do these people really think they can win a nuclear war? Surely, they must realize that the places they live would be prime targets.  They have shocking bravado. Unless they have some magic technology to shut down all Russian nukes this is foolish. Let’s hope we make it through the next two months. Although even Trump is bringing some guys like Sebastian Gorka that were really pushing war against Syria I believe.

            I suspect some of them think this will bring about the end times where their people rise into heaven and the rest of us perish in the fires of hell. Many have convinced themselves that escalatory dominance is on their side. Most are simply so full of hatred for Russians that they cannot conceive of a scenario where Russia is not defeated and they get to rule over their ancient enemy to the east.

            I occasionally tune in to the warmongers and their thoughts on the conflict and the risks of escalation.  Listening to these people is scary.  Their thoughts essentially boil down to this: “Putin has warned of escalation risks for almost 3 years without Putin escalating.  Therefore, escalation is not a risk because Putin is bluffing and cannot use his nuclear weapons.”In reality, I don’t think this is that wrong. Nuclear escalation is a huge step with little payoff.  Putin using nukes in Ukraine is a bad idea from his point of view.  Russia probably doesn’t want radioactive particles driven by the winds and rain over Western Russia.  This would contaminate a large part of Russia crops.  Eating or breathing contaminated dust is death. The winds naturally go from West to East.   The political fallout of Russia using nukes in Ukraine would also be severe. They would likely lose support all over the world and in China particularly.I would think the real risks of nuclear escalation is accidental.  I would love to have been in the room of the people responsible for detecting launches in Russia when the missile was launched,  but before the trajectory could be solved.  Even after it was, they had to be thinking this could have been a nuclear payload.  This is the real danger….unintended escalation.

            Uruguay is fine, but comparing it to Switzerland is a massive stretch. Argentinians like to buy properties in Punta del Este and some have bank accounts there, but that’s about it. Uruguay is more like a sleepy Spanish colonial backwater. It’s pleasant, slow and safe by South American standards.

                    A European can certainly blend in there. The ancestries in Uruguay are mostly Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, with some German and Central European. I have met a few German speaking natives there. In general, very chill people and a calm and sleepy country. Argentina is quite European too, Chile less so, but still OK.

                    I always thought the Falkland Islands might be a nice change. Far from the madding crowd, that’s for sure. It would be tiresome eating nothing but mutton and shellfish, if all contact and trade was lost. But in compensation, no diversity. Kind of like burning the boat and settling on Pitcairn Island. Tradeoffs, always tradeoffs…

                Actually. the most Swiss-like spot in Argentina is la Cumbrecita in the Sierra de Córdoba. There are some other villages on the eastern slope and in the valley that are somewhat that way as well. Villa General Belgrano with its Oktoberfest is more German than Swiss (Graf Speesettlers). I live on the western slope piedmont in a zone called Traslasierra, been here for 20 years.Argentina is now touted as doing wonderfully, but Mr. Milei is something of a Southern Hemisphere Zelensky. He´s DJT´s “favorite president” and is setting the place up for the return of the vulture capitalists. He’s done a good job a la DJT’s promises on the gov fat-trimming side, but he’s setting up the slow Argentines for the kosher capitalist coup. It’s quite possible I’m paranoid, but so far so good with predictions of this type and I’m 78, so if wrong, won’t make much difference. I’m hedged!

        With all due respect for taxonomic distinctions, I’m not sure there is much functional difference between Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz and John Bolton. I realize both have nodded in a less bellicose direction recently, but I am skeptical that when push comes to shove, they will find an excuse to keep the Ukraine war going. Same for Hegseth.

        We may be living in a situation more grave than 1962. At least then, Americans were aware that a crisis was at hand; they may not have known the half of it, but they knew enough to lose sleep at night. Biden’s apparent insouciance is, I am afraid, shared by at least half the country. Someone – here or at Sev’s – posted a video of two girls buried in their cellphones while a 600 pound bear mosied up to the bench they were sitting on, and their reaction was, well, ok, but it’s not like its on my Instagram, so like, what’s the big deal??A mushroom cloud will appear on the horizon, and the first instinct of thousands will be to pull out the phone and do a video.

        Most of the discussions and comments on this subject incorporate the word nuclear, which is an indication that the import of this weapon is still not recognized. With tons of metal arriving precisely on target at Mach five, a factory can be selectively removed without damaging the cars in the parking lot or the school down the street. Likewise any aircraft carrier can be made into a submarine without harming the support ships available to pick up the survivors. No icky radiation. Against this, there is no defense.

            This is true, and it does change the calculus. With enough of these missiles, the Russians can wage nuclear war but without the nukes. One of these missiles can certainly sink a carrier or take out Dinoma (in Israel). Our carriers just became obsolete. Is there any doubt about the Russians sharing this technology with the Chinese or even the North Koreans and Iranians? The Israelis must be crapping their pants right now.

        I was in a ELINT/SIGINT unit in Germany in the 80s that could listen far into East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Our primary focus was to figure out the precursor electronic and communications traffic to an intermediate range ballistic missile launch. That would give an increase in warning time to prepare. That was serious stuff back then.

            Why manipulate a regime into creating justification for a coup, when it is due to be replaced in two months anyway? Without getting into the ideological bent of the military leadership, which does not seem to me to be disposed to a move against Biden. I’d guess that if there is to be a military coup, it’s more likely that it would be against Trump upon taking office, before he can purge the brass.

        ‘Even so, he will inherent a world that is now infinitely more dangerous thanks to the reckless behavior of the Biden admin.’Nothing reckless about the latest U.S. provocation.  It was calculated for a purpose, possibly to delay or annul the Trump inauguration.  But for a purpose, in any case.And of course the ‘Biden Administration’ didn’t make the determination to launch.  Well above their pay grade.  They’re just the announcers.Once the ‘Biden Administration’ decided to tank the U.S. economy in favor of the NWO Build Back Better scam, the green light was lit for Russia and China to ramp-up collusion against a common enemy.  BRICS was, and is, one element of that growing partnership.

            A lot of Establishment types probably think Putin is a mirror image of Trump in that he’s surrounded by others in his party who are more loyal to globohomo than to their “leader”. As the Z-man is fond of pointing out though, Putin is a “moderate” in the Russian context. If they get rid of him, they get somebody more intransigent. I guess it’s natural for these people to always think they have a color revolution already staged and waiting to be kicked off including pre-printed protest signs and snarky T-shirts.

        There is another aspect to this: the land based portion of the nuclear deterrence triad (ICBM’s) is now obsolete. A hypersonic weapon that can collapse 4 levels of deep bunkers, ostensibly hardened to resist nuclear attack, is going to make short work of collapsing missile silos.
If Karen and Shitavious show off their navigational acumen by driving our SSBN’s into a mountain again (actually it was an SSN last time) then the GAE is in trouble.  Poor GAE … I would have laughed two years. Now I don’t even care enough to bother.

            Certainly, but they still serve to draw off such missiles and therefore protect other aspects of our deterrence.  The MIRV aspect however is problematic.

        I saw claimed video of the impact. It showed several fast moving dots and notably no explosions afterward. That would lend support to the conjecture that this was merely a demonstration of their capability.

            What I read was the missiles were not nukes or conventional explosives, but were of a solid, kinetic impact type.  Sort of like what we hit tanks with to “burn” through the armor.  This coupled with the tremendous speed of the missiles is designed to produce the destruction of the facilities underground.  No expert, but it seemed reasonable at the time.  I await more information from knowledgeable and reasoned minds here.

        The Russians will look to Donald Trump to give them a fair deal early in his administration as regards Ukraine. That means regions with Ethnic Russian majorities join Russia, Ukraine lays down it’s arms, and Ukraine stays out of NATO. The problem is the European powers are persistent. Willing to wait until Putin is gone, they’ll try again (to lure Ukraine into NATO) tomorrow.Locked on a course of “defensive-aggression” in the East, France and Germany will murmur supportive lined to one another, goading the opposite to go on. And they will. I don’t think Russia’s threats to fire off the nukes will be believed until the missiles are in the air— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

                    Ukrainian peasants are unwilling too and yet they are being sent to the meat grinder. As long as there is a willing “elite”, the empire will be useful.
Also worth noting it that while Europeans are vassals of the US, the US is just a golem. The golem is also bankrupt and sick, but it’s still big, obedient and powerful.
