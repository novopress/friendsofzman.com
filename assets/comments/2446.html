        There’s really no problem “assessing monetary loss”. The problem is that that number is large enough to scare most courts.
Nobody changes jobs for less than a 10% (typically 12-18%) raise and high-tech companies expect a 10% turnover rate. Penalty: 1.5% of design group payroll per year this went on (X7=10.5%). Triple damages for  antitrust violation (31.5%). Without even getting into punative damage, the $ are huge, much bigger than $324M.

        The problem is proving damages and assessing monetary loss, and upon cursory inspection I don’t think the prosecution’s case is that strong. I’m surprised the judge would throwout the settlement , but that’s liberalism infecting the courts

When you have the defendants admitting their guilt and offering to settle, the case is about as strong as it gets. No one denies what was going on here. The dispute is over how much harm they caused. My preferences would be for all of them to be publicly flogged.

        Re: “Steve Jobs is being sodomized by Hitler and Stalin in Hell right now.”
They may very well all be together, but I think you got it wrong about who is zooming who.

        @ZMAN:  You’ve found your life’s true calling: writing the script for a movie about Steve Jobs!  What are you waiting for?

        I’d be surprised if anything Jobs has done will undo Apple. Apple worship is like Obama worship, and often from the same people.

I call it the MacCult. Way back when Apple was on its knees, barely hanging on, I chatted up a girl at a bar, who informed me she was a MacSnob. She only used Apple products. Jobs had one great idea and that was figuring how to lever the cult following of this otherwise mediocre product.

        This is presented as a news story, not an editorial, and one of the “facts” reported therein is that Jobs was “an unquestioned genius”.
