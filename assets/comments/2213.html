        The Jewish political culture is, to be kind, insane. For each Milton Friedman and Mark Levin there are ten of Saul Alinsky and Bill Ayers. This is an evil which is effective exactly in proportion to the degree of intelligence which propagates it, and that is very intelligent indeed. It is an intellectual barbarism for which society has no defense. The favorite weapon of the barbarians is the use of shaming, a crucial emotion of which they themselves are incapable.

        That The United States’ largest ethnic group is German has always puzzled me. How could this be so in an English speaking, Eastern Protestant former British colony? In fact I am calling bullshit.
Of the ten most common surnames in The United States we have Smith, Williams, Johnson, Brown, Jones, Miller, Davis and Wilson. Not far behind are Anderson, Taylor and Thomas. All of these names are of British origin.
A few more common Hispanic names litter the list.

            I don’t know. I’m just going by whatethnographers tell us.
Given current policy, the largest ethnic group will be Amerind-Iberian soon enough.

        They are the Horror of mankind.       Greed lust filth and Godlessness.  You would think they would change their name because it’s synonymous with wickedness. Start fresh.  All the demons are dead.  There’s no reason why a child born there should carry the burden of something they had no part in.  How bout this.. …be the best,  give to the poor,  serve your  neighbor.  Let’s not forget Japan killed 20 million Chinese and although they have not embraced  forgiveness through Christ(none), which might show a sinister heart lurking beneath the smiles,  they are not arrogant –a trait Germans carry in abundance.

        Many German immigrants or their children Anglicized their names, especially during WW1, but those were the more recent immigrants. There was a flood of German immigrants already coming to America in the latter half of the 18th century. Pennsylvania was one third German at that time.In Henry Adams day Germany was thought to be perhaps the most civilized country in the world–scientifically, industrially, intellectually, and artistically. It also found itself locked into an unfortunate geopolitical location, quite unlike the natural advantages given to Britain, America, or even France. Germany did not even exist until Bismark formed both it and the German mind which followed. The impact of that single evil genius are almost completely unappreciated.All in all, America has turned farther away from it’s promise than Germany, and the pace is accelerating. It seems more likely that Germany will exist in 2114 than will America.

        The Gothic sack of Rome did little to alter the political economy of the Empire.  The northern European economy was crushed in the seventh century, not the fifth, and the cause was the end of Mediterranean trade and the devastation of North Africa wreaked by Arab Muslim invaders, not German Goths. The Belgian historian Henri Pirenne wrote the book about it.

        The Germans do not deserve primary blame for the catastrophe of World War I. From what I have read, all sides deserve about equal blame. Serbia deserves blame for their wink-and-nod sponsoring of terrorism against Austria (Read Sidney Fay’s exhaustive account –http://www.amazon.com/The-Origins-World-War-Volume/dp/092389134X/). Russia deserves blame for sponsoring Serbia’s rogue behavior. Germany and Austria deserve blame for being so reckless and aggressive in their response to the assassination. Russia deserves blame for mobilizing first, thus forcing Germany’s hand. France and England deserve blame for first declaring war on Germany (The Kaiser had no wish to fight either country). England deserves blame for not agreeing to peace talks when the war was at stalemate, and insisting on nothing short than the destruction of the German regime (Germany made no similar demands on England).To get a sense of British culpability, read “How diplomats make war” by Francis Neilson, a British writer during the war (https://archive.org/details/howdiplomatsmake00neil). For years, British press and politicians had been playing up the threat of the Huns, it was like the build up to Iraq only much more intense. The British were primed for war, and they declared war on Germany, not the opposite.

        The English Americans established the American political institutions and culture, and the German Americans assimilated into the existing culture when many of them arrived later. The German Americans also largely settled in the Midwest, and New York and Washington have always dominated the social and political institutions. The politics of Minnesota and Wisconsin give one a good flavor of the German love of socialism, and the blind passion by which they will pursue the establishment of a socialist culture.

        Bill Bryson in one of his books pointed out that the fledgeling US nation almost voted for German as the national language.
Had they done so, there would have been a quite different outcome to the two world wars.

        Sure is a lot of shoulda, coulda, woulda, in there. Solely from the excerpts chosen to be shown above, this “thesis” gets MY “no need to pursue further” discrimination.SOME (allegedly)college level “papers”, repackaged as “intellectual discourse” is simply unworthy of MY precious time to “challenge”.“But..but…if you don’t take the time to read every word and “idea” then you can’t comment!”Kinda’ like judges without vaginas can’t opine on women’s behavior or “special exceptions”?

        The Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) was fought primarily in what is now Germany, and at various points involved most countries in Europe. It was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history. The conflict lasted, unceasing, for 30 years, making it the longest continuous war in modern history.The European armies fought it out on German soil and the population their suffered with estimates that 50% of it departing this world (about 8 million) – so we might call it a small holocaust for the German people at that time.

        Z Man, Since you say up at the top that your site is about “Sports, Culture and other stuff”,  I gotta say this is the finniest soccer satire, pretending to be a pseudo-intellectual bigot desperately rationalizing his naked hatred for an entire people.
Oh, wait.  You are serious.  You utter JERK.
On the matter of soccer, however, Germany worked 8 hard years for this.  In the final, they were against not only Argentinians who played very, very dirty, but also against referees who were wilfully blind to 90% of Argentina’s fouls.  AND THEY STILL WON.
Shame on you.

            Odds are, the Germans bribed the referees to win. That’s how it is done in soccer. Like professional wrestling, soccer is mostly staged. The difference between soccer and wrestling is the fans of the latter know it is farce.

        According to the Census Bureau by way of Wikipedia:
The ten largest ancestries of American Whites are: German Americans (16.5%), Irish Americans (11.9%), English Americans (9.0%), Italian Americans (5.7%), Mexican Americans (5.4%), French Americans (4%), Polish Americans (3%), Scottish Americans (1.9%), Dutch Americans (1.6%), and Norwegian Americans (1.5%).[8][9]
Most American blacks have English surnames so that would skew an ethnic survey based on surnames.

            Why do you separate Irish Americans, Scottish Americans and English Americans? Apply that to the German Americans that came from Austria and other independent German speaking Kingdoms during that time and the statistic looks different.
