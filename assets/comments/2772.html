        If the Dems believe ISIS is going to just sit on the sidelines between now and November, they are dreaming.  I’d bet a ton of money ISIS will do something big just before the US midterm election to poke a stick in Obama’s eye, so to speak. It wouldn’t surprise me if they attempted an attack on US soil just to show how impotent they consider us.  And they’d be right.  That’s what you get when your leader is a f***g  “Behind.”

        The reason that Republicans cannot fully benefit from this incredibly stupid Democrat administration is, well, because of a incredibly stupid Republican party.  As a believer in the tea party I feel that the Republican party has not only left me but they have tried to discriminate against me and marginalize me.  I don’t really “want” to vote Republican in November.  I want to punish the Republicans and I also have no faith that if the Republicans do get a majority in the Senate that they will do anything for the citizens.  I doubt they will secure the border.  I doubt they will reduce taxes and spending.  I doubt that they will stop the EPA and other federal departments from destroying our economy and our country.  I doubt they will try to reverse Obamacare.  What I think they will do with a majority in both houses is start to reward THEIR cronies instead of the Democrat cronies.  Personally I would rather be stabbed in the chest by Democrats then stabbed in the back by Republicans.

        …a massive Republican victory. They could … stop his planned amnesty.
By instituting a sweeping amnesty of their own design?  Yeah that’ll be great.
