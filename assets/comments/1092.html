        We Brits were hoping you would keep Mr Morgan for a good while longer. But if the USA doesn’t want him I expect he will return to the UK where he will freely pontificate on things he has opinions on but knows nothing about.
Perhaps the worst news we could have, short of disease and war.

        Not sure if I have mentioned on here but look on the YouTubes for recent clips of Brett Lee hurting Morgan with a speeding cricket ball. Much more than just seeing him wince in pain while being humiliated, it was nice to see one of the tough talking pundits actually put his balls on the line. Well, the results were delicious and he may well think twice before trashing professional athletes on air again – if anyone ever again offers him the opportunity.
