        3D printing has also been arousing my interest of late. The Chinese claim to have printed 12 houses in one day. If true, this manner of construction could wipe out millions of jobs not only in America but in the third-world too.

            That’s not really very interesting unless you want to live in plastic tool sheds. The technology that will make the bigger difference in our time is 3D subtraction. The technology is proven. It is rabidly getting cheaper and smaller which will allow for a whole lot of re-shoring.

        “…a guy who appears to learn the jargon of science and technology, but knows nothing about science and technology….”Why did Rasputin’s image pop into my head?DANG, it was just supplanted by L.Ron Hubbard’s.

        Yes, the future is hard to predict but where all super-technology predictions falter is in the human element.
People were always people, whether they had machines or not, and there isa very good chance that people will continue to be people no matter what they have at hand to seemingly make the future more exciting.
there will, irrespective of progress, still be the fools, the gullible, the despots, the swift-to-take-advantage and the sheep waddling along in line. They all may be fascinated by the tiny and the shiny but they will be just the same as people always were.
