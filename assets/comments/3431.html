        Yes, Dan Kurt, I know. That particular Twilight Zone episode I referenced was based on Knight’s short story.

        I’ll go with the ancients on this one.  Potentiality is the prime mover.  Whatever is potential in this rock, hand full of dust, will under the right circumstances emerge.  So, liberty, beauty, truth, etc, are latencies of primordial matter as much as BMW motorcycles, human life, and missions of inter galactic discovery.
Highly advanced beings likely take on the form of biological life just as a way to break up the boredom of virtual immortality.
And,five minutes of Schneider’s talk and I fail to see how she can be considered a Philosopher.

        …that the dominant intelligence in the cosmos is probably artificial.(Based on an exceedingly limited number of facts tied together by bunch of flimsy assumptions, resting on a mountain of speculation.)Every time I read futurist schlock like that I’m reminded of how “Arthur C. Clarke invented the communications satellite.” Clarke, of course, gave us the brilliant idea of a geosynchronous satellite that could relay messages worldwide.What he didn’t foresee was the development of semiconductors.  His satellite was a manned space station where technicians would stay busy changing burned out vacuum tubes and relays, and never mind what all that space radiation was doing to their bone marrow.Siri, Watson and “Eugene” have breathed new life into the Strong AI camp.  Science is as affected by fads and trends as anything else, so obviously the universe is populated by synthetic intelligence.  Papers will be written about its nature, grants will be awarded, tenure granted and in a decade or two technological advance and social change will make the whole thing look quaint and ridiculous.I predict that alien intelligence will look exactly like the alien intelligence we find if and when we find it. (And as you observe, that’s a harder row to hoe, intellectually, that making up nonsense about silicon-based artificial life forms that don’t share our values.)

        Reproduction is an instinct, albeit an extremely vital one, and yes, life is driven by that, but not just that. The search for Meaning is what separates us from the non -sentient. Any old mouth breather can reproduce, and the genius among us can choose not to reproduce of their own accord. As for the extra-terrestrials? Who the hell really knows until they present themselves to us. Maybe they’re going to harvest us ala “To Serve Man” from The Twilight  Zone? Maybe they’ll be benign scientists like E.T.? Or giant mechanical creatures like the latest crop of Alien movies to come out of Hollywood? I totally don’t know and I’m not going to pretend I have any insight in this area. I think it’s much more likely we’ll destroy ourselves before any aliens get the chance.

        Regardless, the Borg was thought up when they rebooted the Star Trek series for TV. That was ripped off from the first Star Trek movie when Voyager returns after having acquired all knowledge in the universe
It’s worse than that. The movie plot borrowed heavily from an episode of the original series. Critics panning the movie pointed this out.

        hmmm…But with 7 billion people and growing, we don’t necessarily need more reproduction for the sake of reproduction. Many hopeful people voluntarily choose to forgo reproduction because of the opportunity costs associated with reproduction. Humans are the only species capable of suppressing primitive biological urges such. If singularism can extend consciousness of the world’s greatest minds indefinitely, the applications and benefits would be immense.

        It is hard to imagine a group of people more ruthlessly conformist than those who have risen to the top of the Academy.
