        What’s interesting is that the cop asks him if he’s a “white nationalist.” That’s a very bizarre question to ask. Is the cop trying to get in on the circus or was he instructed by his bosses to ask that question.
Either way, it (again) shows that the police are d-bags who are most definitely not on our side.

            I would guess the cops asked the woman why she was there in the first place and that was the reason she gave.  Still that is a strange question to lead with.

                Yeah, realized that after I wrote the post, but, like you said, it’s still odd.Fuentes was cheeky with them by saying he was Mexican, but he’d have been better off questioning them right back. “Why would you ask me that?” If they said that it’s because she called him that, he could say, “Well, if she called me a space alien, would you ask me if I was one?” or “What does that even mean? Is it even illegal to be a white nationalist? Why would you care?”Put the cops on the back heel. Make them know that you’re questioning them as much as they are questioning you because you’re ready to sue everyone involved in this mess.

                    I disagree. You should never do anything to prolong an interaction with the police, especially right outside of your house.  Your little word games or arguments can easily turn into reasonable suspicion or worse, probable cause.If you are internet famous as a White supremacist and If you just pepper sprayed an old woman and knocked her down a flight of steps, your only response to the police should be “I want a lawyer, I have no statements to make at this time”  Yes, this would result in your arrest at the moment (they only have the complainant’s word as to what happened), but later, when the police question you at the station, there can be no games with you because your lawyer is next to you.

                        True. I was thinking like a normal person, which when faced with the law, is insane.
You’re right. The only response is, “I want to see my lawyer.”

                        100% on point. It is hard to understand for anyone that hasn’t had a police interaction. They do sort of telegraph this to you when arrested however so people should pay close attention to the Miranda language.“Anything you say can and WILL be used AGAINST you in a court of law.”Not “may help you”, “may mitigate the circumstances”, will be usedAGAINSTyou. I have unfortunate personal experience with this.When armed thugs appear and blow your life apart for whatever reason the immediate human response is to deescalate in some way. This never helps, you won’t get off ‘easier’. The interaction is going to play out either way probably with you in cuffs. Cops are not sympathetic they are there to record your words to later be twisted and weaponized against you by a slimy weasel prosecutor. I took the L on this and learned the hard way and did some damage to my case because I did not understand how sociopathic and corrupt cops and prosecutors are.STOP TALKING.

                            Precisely. Ask if you are under arrest, and if the answer is yes, demand an attorney. If no, walk away.

                            Worse still, court rules mean anything you say can/will be used against you, while nothing in this record which can help you is admissible in court.  It is all hearsay.  “Officer, I dindu nuffin” is not admissible.The cops are not interested in your side of the story, generally speaking. They are investigating if a crime occurred and if so, who they can arrest.Even without the much worse and lower hiring standards and hiring outsiders, in general, the cop’s hands are tied.  No cop wants to be the guy who let Brian Laundrie and Gabby Petito go on their way.  More importantly,  no police chief or other bosses want this either.  It’s always safer to arrest now, sort it out later.  Cops who are not “team players” pay a price even if they aren’t forced off the force.We don’t have sense-driven peace officers.  In the old days, they would have arrested the Jewess (or sent her on her way) for going there for the sole purpose of starting a fight with the guy.   But they knew she had a twitter account, they knew the toxic nature of accusations of White supremacy.  If she recorded them telling her to go home and stop starting trouble, they would be having hit pieces written on them.  Their names and addresses would be making the rounds on the antifa sites.  Now common sense means arrest Fuentes, the guy sitting in his house minding his own business.

                Nevertheless, the politics of an alleged perp should be irrelevant, unless the cop was trying to set Fuentes up for a so-called “hate crime” rap. Regardless, this strikes me as entrapment, and that cop should have been fired yesterday. But it wouldn’s surprise me if he was doing to the Chief’s or the DA’s bidding.

            How did normie cop even know to ask that? I’ll bet his captain knew Fuentes was in his precinct by way of leftist activists. And that there had been complaints coming out of there before…could have been rowdy gay sex parties, but probably just random mutants showing up in his neighborhood, which led to the gassing. So Precinct Captain still thinks it’s 2020 and tells his underlings to watch out for aggressive white supremacists.

That’s the right question. The proper defense of this case is to show how much Jews bribe law enforcement. It might even be possible to do now, Free Palestine, Stop the Genocide, all that.

                That’s easy.  The complaining witness is the first person they will contact.  They will have told the police they were there because, reasons, and the guy is a White supremacist.Fuentes should not have pepper sprayed her or threw her down the steps.  This is a basic IQ test.  Is he that much of a weakling (both mentally and physically) that he cannot get rid of an old woman without pepper spray or battery?  Surely he understood that part of the goal of showing up to his house is to get him to overreact so lawfare can be used against him?  This weirdo not only got charges pressed on him, but now she is going to file a lawsuit against him, which he will have to defend.If there is anyone in the world who should know we live in clownworld, it’s Nick Fuentes.  He has to know that any physical altercation with an old Jewess is going to end badly for him.  How could you not know this?

                    He didn’t even have to answer the door. I don’t answer the door unless I know who’s coming.I am inclined to think that it was a combination of he got triggered – I’m sure he’s under stress – and that he thought it would give him some pub. His minions routinely threaten people with violence; why would he not be violent himself, in a moment of lacking composure? And I agree with Z that his interaction with the police is not a “self own” as the BAPosphere was trying to say, but Nicky Boy knew it would go viral with the right people.

                    By Z’s calculations, Fuentes felt this publicity would only enhance his cyber-celebrity and he is willing to endure the lawfare to do so. In a society hopelessly addicted to celebrity, this makes a great deal of sense.

                Problem is, it’s not trespassing to knock at someone’s door.  If they tell you to leave, they generally have to leave or it tuns into trespassing.  But AFAIK, generally speaking, without a warning, anywhere the mailman can get to is fair game.
The courts have upheld this crap for decades. The cops can up on your porch and look through the window because of plain view doctrine and the mailman standard.

                    Yeah, in my burg it is not trespassing unless you’ve posted a “no trespassing” sign in your yard. I’m guessing Fuentes hadn’t done that.

            They’ve become “civil rights” goons. For example, about 25 years ago in my West Texas city, my barber refused to cut a negro’s ‘fro for the simple reason that he didn’t know how to. Well, that pissed the nuggra off and he apparently went to the cops. The very next day a cop showed up at the barber shop and asked Charlie if he refused to cut the Hutu’s hair. He said yes and explained why, and the cop quit the place without further incident. But by what right does a cop harrass anybody for something like this? If the pavement ape feels he’s got a case, the proper procedure in anything but a negrocracy is to file a civil suit. The goons in blue should have nothing to do with it.

            reply. “I’m not sure of the legal definition for white nationalist.  my name is fuentes”  pfft. judiciary cant hardly define the difference between a man and a woman.  when speaking with law enforcement do not ever admit to anything.  they have six ways from sunday to entrap and prosecute with your own speech.  be civil and hand over id, but never admit anything.here in california and federally, law enforcement can now be a foreign entity. my first question to law enforcement  “are you a citizen of the united states?”  thinking a citizen detained by a foreign entity is unconstitutional in the united states.  becomes even more complex when law enforcement must first prove citizenship, when everyone and his brother can get a ss card, drivers license and an obama birth certificate.persons on the ball, already know authority is lost here in the u.s.  law enforcement and authority in general is seen as nuisance which requires minimum civil citizen cooperation by lethal threat of physical violence.  allegiance is lost, government rules by force.

            Fuentes will more than likely walk on this charge BTW. Because –another- unhinged leftists just came to his house to kill him for real this time. That is all the evidence he needs that his life truly “was” in danger from an unknown person at the door.Real story- just happened—https://www.the-sun.com/news/13127535/nick-fuentes-berwyn-suspect-shooter/Dude was walking around with a .22LR pistol and a crossbow, cops lit him up obviously after hebrilliantlydecided to use that .22 pistol to get in a gunfight with the police.  🙄  But since Nick has a known address and lefties are unhinged lunatics there is -some- chance he may be snuffed sooner or later. If lefties weren’t so incredibly r-tarded when it comes to weapons they would be an actual threat but thankfully they are fairly incompetent with firearms.Yet in spite of nearly every assassin or would be assassin of the past year being an unhinged lefty lunatic the shill media still talks about the “dangerous right”. They should be investigated for instigating and “stochiastic terrorism” themselves by constantly using phrases like ‘Nazi, Hitler, White Supremacist’, etc.

        …the world’s biggest shit poster happens to be the world’s richest man and pals with another shit poster, Donald Trump. They attacked the spending bill in Congress and then support for it collapses. Perhaps even in the circus of American politics good things can happen with the right ringmaster.The difference this time around is that Elon and some other BOM henchmen have somehow convinced the President to make threats that Elon and others will back up with action, which obviously did not happen in 2016. When this spending bill the Vichy party attempted to sneak in came out, Elon immediately threatened to bankroll ultra mega MAGA challengers to the Republicans who voted for it, and he was taken seriously. Instead of Evangelical heretic and all around backstabbing cuck Mike Pence,  Joe Dirt Vance is there to encourage the BOM to make good on his threats.Of course, the biggest change is that the BOM got shot, which apparently has made him realize that he’s better play for keeps this time. There’s another indication he’s serious this time, because unlike 2016, there is not celebrities calling for his assassination- because they fear that this time around that shit might have repercussions.

                Yep.  First thing he did after winning last time was to publicly seek conciliation with Hillary Clinton.  Which told me he was not a serious person or a serious president and that he didn’t have the groceries to make the changes he said he would.  And he didn’t, either.

                    Yes. I watched him appear post-election, pre-inauguration on SIXTY MINUTES, and he told Lesley Stahl he would not prosecute Clinton. Then and there I knew it was a lamb to slaughter and unlikely to keep his word. To his credit, he somehow survived all that followed. There are people around him now, though, who intend to punish their enemies, who Trump himself still delusionally believes can be co-opted. If they do that, and they very well may, great.

            Great points Rick. I’d just add that the problem is that the “circus” obscures the issue. We’re going broke. So the sh*tposting focuses the public on he/she who has the better “circus performance” – the wittier Tweets – rather than the underlying pathology of poor governance and excessive spending. Maybe this is the best we can do now.

                “We’re going broke.”
Nope. We are broke. What the US faces is far worse than credit card debt. Not only can’t we make the payments, we’ve somehow become committed to having the principal go up every year even if we did make the payments.
If your financial planner did something like that, he’d be asset-stripped and tossed in prison without the possibility of parole. But if you do crap like that at scale, you become “the Honorable.”

                    Speaking of which, does anyone know a good place to get a realistic, non-hyperbolic model of the future course of the debt? I know we’re entering the “death spiral” part but the exact speed at which the interest is capitalized thus creating ever higher total debt and even faster capitalization of interest isn’t clear to me. I could easily make my own simple model with Google Sheets but I’m sure someone has built something more sophisticated by now.

                    Semantics at best. Saw a video several years back from an independent YouTuber who visits countries and talks to the man in the street. I viewed this one because he was in Argentina. At that time he reported that the “official” inflation rate was 50% yearly, so who knows what it was.The odd thing was, when he asked “Just why is inflation so high?”, everyone knew it was because the government spent (printed) too much money to pay for all the entitlements promised—and of course year after year the entitlements grew in a failed attempt to beat the inflation rate.The second question was, “How do you survive such inflation?”. The response of one pensioner was to pay all the bills she could on the 1st of the month when the pension check rolled in, then to buy all the food she could until the money ran out, then prey she’d not starve until the next check came.At that point, “this shit is real” as they say. Argentina printed it’s own currency as well, and as shown in the video every Argentine traded their surplus pesos on the black market for euro or dollars as quickly as they got them.

                        I recently visited Argentina on vacation.Wild to see a country that was definitely rich and European in the early 1900s but has fallen into massive decline.Youtuber Patrick Boyle has a great piece called “Javier Milei One Year In!”.He describes Argentina as the only South American country that “was a developed country and is now a developing country.”He’s a lib, but has generally great things to say about Javier. The whole country had something like 30% of the people on the public dole, insane amounts of regulation, and every single year would print more money “just this once” to dig the hole deeper.Scary stuff.  Probably where we’re headed, only with lots of racial nastiness on top of it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLq02MpjZQc

            At some point it had to happen. The classical liberals have finally crashed and burned. Normie has turned off the TV, Mr. Griller is paying attention.The world has changed. The public is now more sophisticated and more informed than ever before. They didn’t fall for the capering leftist clowns and their slapstick routines in the last election. I don’t think they’ll fall for Nick either. Sure, there’s any number of idiots still around but they are starting to thin out as the geriatrics shuffle off, and their kids are red pilled by reality. As realities get ever more dire and meaningful to more and more people… Nick is just today’s equivalent to fags like Vox Day, Milo and Spencer.As our Esteemed Blog Host has noted before, The Big Top is casting about for volunteers from the Dissident Right to step up and play their part in the old morality play. Nick is stepping up, as will others. Gotta admit it is entertaining at first… but it gets old fast.It will be interesting. Can the dying mass media destroy Nick the same way they did with the old Alt Right clowns and carnies? If so… then they aren’t dead enough. Not to ally with Fuentes, he’s obviously not speaking for us… but he will serve as an acceptable canary in the coal mine.

            I think the most surprising (and hopeful) thing to come out of Trump’s victory has been the formation of what looks very much like the core of a whole new political party with a huge amount of ready made funding on board right at the start. Musk and the other pro-Trump oligarchs are that core with Trump and eventually Vance (and others) as the frontmen. All that remains is to push the Republican Party into the grave where it belongs. As long as the Republicucks are blacklisted and forbidden to join the new party we’ve got a chance to turn things around. Another sign of this happening will be when big name cucks start joining the Democrats. I nominate Miss Lindsey as the first to go. Let’s buy xhim a fancy chiffon dress with sequins to wear to the first campaign rally as a D!

                Wrong! That illegal sneaking across the border is MORE American than you or me. Legal Americans, especially the white ones, don’t appreciate the freedoms that Israel protects for us.

            Infeasible. However, you are absolutely correct in noting the sorts of problems created uniquely by dieversity. The idea that “diversity is our strength” may be the biggest howler ever foisted upon a people by its power structure. Closer to the truth, dieversity is doom.

        I’m reminded of the pop music industry, where ever since Sinatra, singers have had to be ever more outrageous with each generation to get attention. At some point, you have to believe they’ll likewise start killing chickens, spitting on their followers, biting the heads off of bats, humping giant inflatable penises, and, in the tradition of rappers and Scandinavian death metal bands, probably start shooting each other. This could get really good! Too bad none of these guys can sing.

        Dont know a whole lot about tech but I feel like all the attention seeking is first a human instinct, but also driven by add revenue. Now I wonder how much profit are these corporations really squeezing out from all the obsessive advertisement?You now have to see adds of weird lite skinned black and brown people hiking or driving race cars on Netflix despite paying a subscription. So Netflix is being paid by advertisers who in turn are making enough more money to justify the intrusions?Maybe when the add bubble finally collapses the circus will have to fire a lot of the carnies and we can be adults again.

            I don’t know if it’s been the same with you lot, but for me, about two months ago, the Internet was hit with a veritable blizzard of obnoxious pop-up ads and banners and it persists to this day. It’s gotten to the point that some websites are almost unusable.Unfortunately for me, the website that employs me is one of the very worst. And not just because of the adware’s ubiquity, but also because of its flagrant anti-white content. As an example, there was recently an American Express banner that alternated two separate images of couples having drinks at a table in an outdoor courtyard. In BOTH of them, the man was a porch monkey and the woman was a mudshark. Could the Power Structure’s agenda possibly be more obvious? And the election of Trump hasn’t blunted it, at least not on the cultural level.

        “One of the ironies of the bodycam phenomenon is that it was to prevent cops from framing innocent black bodies, but it is now mostly used by prosecutors to sway public opinion.”
The irony is that it did the opposite most of the time. I remember reading one study that said it helped exonerate the vast majority of officers accused of police misconduct. I know it’s hard to believe, but [Gasp] black people lie a lot about these interactions and then try and ruin people’s lives rather than own up to their own mistakes.

            This is the take I agree with most. He REALLY should have left Illinois. I’m not defending police, at all, who are at best useful idiots and at worst sociopathic human garbage same as soldiers, but I can tell you with certainty had he lived in nowheresville like I do this probably wouldn’t have even resulted in his arrest let alone a trial. You have to be realistic about where you are anymore. If you’re one of us and you live in Blue Hive, any of them, you get to have this happen to you. A lot. It’s not worth whatever keeps people there.

        Fuentes could be made to stand on the opposite corner with a sandwich board that reads, “I beat up old women.”
You had the better line earlier:“I gas Jewish women.”

        In an ancient Star Trek episode, two planets at war decided to civilize the conflict by eliminating the violence and replacing actual combat with computer simulations that calculated casualties, and then designated citizens would self-terminate in antiseptic death chambers. The war never ended because the horror consequence was hidden and made palatable. We are suffering a similar fate with no end in sight. We continue to degenerate because the decline is slow and moderated by distraction. If Fuentes had blow her head off with a shotgun, that would likely have tangibly changed adverse social behaviors comprehensively.

            It’s probably Fuentes’s last shot at stardom. He’s been beclowning himself for most of 2024 and losing all kinds of support. If the trial gets attention, he’s vindicated as a media star (at least for a while longer). If nobody cares, then Fuentes proves that e-celebrity only goes so far. No one’s forgotten about David Duke. I even think Richard Spencer will be remembered until the Boomer Left dies out.

                She just scammed a bunch of people out of millions with a “crypto” coin. How much you wanna bet nobody goes to jail?  Honestly, she’s maybe a 5/10 or 6/10, and when you take her voice into account maybe a 4/10.  Men’s dicks are their own worst enemy.

            What i find interesting, is in 2020 if you questioned covid on social media you were banned or shadow banned. In 2021 you were banned or shadow banned for raising concerns on the jab. But if you hamhandedly compared unjabbed people to plague rats (kinda like a mustache man in Germany did in the 30’s) they let it thru, and it got lots of likes. I know this because a “friend” posted that very same sentiment, i posted articles about how nazis said the same about jews. He unfriended me and deleted the post. They only let thru what they want to get thru. So why are they allowing all the “populism” with that recently deceased CEO?

        I would be interested to hear why so many people take such umbrage with Nick.  Most of the criticism is ad hominem attacks about him being gay, a fed or a Mexican.  I almost never hear substantive criticism of his political acumen, which is incredible considering his age.  I think everyone can acknowledge he’s incredibly talented and can be an asset to any movement.  I understand his antics rub older people the wrong way, but again, he’s 26 and his audience is young people.

            I admit to having little first hand knowledge of Fuentes, however I suspect the hostility is due to suspicion as to whether Fuentes is for himself or the “the cause”.  It’s along, hard  slog to push the cause.  Many take the easy route and become poseurs.

                Is he the one that his followers said he was on some ‘no nut’ kick and used a black light on where they had slept to see if they had any emissions during the night? If that is true, even if he was doing it as a joke, that is pretty gay and also pretty feddy, as there always seems to be some weird sex angle with their agents trying to entrap and compromise people.

            1993 was the remake with a young Gabrielle Anwar.
Personally, I find the classic ending of the 1978 remake to be a metaphor for what happens to me when I have the temerity to publicly express dissident views in Current Year AINO.

        Ocassio-Cortez and M.T. Greene are definitely circus performers.  But Congress has been a clown show way back in the Clarence Thomas hearings:
“Judge, have you ever heard of Long Dong Silver?”   Only a clown would ask that on national television.

            True, but let’s not leave the Rep’s out.  They are no slouchs themselves, especially in the Senate.  They put on a good show for Joe Normie, but accomplish nothing except to gatekeep.

        David Duke’s job was to associate normal Republicans with “nazis.” Same reason the ACLU showily defended the guys in knockoff Hugo Boss, but never any normal right-wingers in trouble. They stood up forboth sides, you see, and that’syour sideright there: fed_heil.jpgFuente’s job is to associate us “nazis” with gay brown incel pedophiles (etc.), to spread “the ick” among the ladies and giveconservativesthe “Oh so you agree with Nick Fuentes” card, since he occasionally pretends to endorse somethingwebelieve, queering us by association.It’s a good paying gig, we know (seen the dox), but you’re not allowed tomethod actit and get physical with some crazy Jewish cat lady. That’s a non-undercover regime operative.

        Maybe it shows the way. Become a Crypto-White. If someone calls you a white supremacist, racist, etc. say you can’t be because you’re black, or mexican, or indian. What are they gonna do, ask to see your genetic profile? I’m serious.

        Holdup, holdup. Are they calling out the clown acts because the northeast is about to get hit with some dirty bombs?Groyper King Versus Blue Yenta is the trailer to “Mar-a-Lago Attacks”?
I saw not just drone nuke sniffers, but max security presence in the NYC subways.(As well as a satellite map of radiological measurement.)
The scuttlebutt is that they were offshored, and have been onshored again.
So, the question becomes, 9/11 or Pearl Harbor? Inside job or allowed to happen?“Foiled Bomb Plot”?
Or, is this the start of Oceania doing its own rocket attacks on Airstrip One?

        Fuentes is an idiot, and now he’s going to be an idiot with a conviction, likely a felony hate crime enhancement to go along with the aggravated battery conviction.  WHY is he even living in Chicago?

They made dumb word, a white Supremacist HispanicIt even retarded than white-Hispanic, amount of incompetence and stupidity of ruling class make people cringe
they just can’t answer the simple question, why they can’t build anything better when white built great thing
people eventually find out that humanity can’t overcome their DNA, especially Jews and blacks

        The question is whether Our Democracy can withstand actual democracy. As we’ve seen, it likely cannot without increased State oppression, censorship and violence, which makes who is the Musk or Trump of the moment more important than ever and indicates political upheaval the remainder of the GAE’s run. For the time being, the system still allows AOC types to be total assclowns while continuing to put the screws to carnies such as Fuentes and Duke*, but the playing field is leveling up some now. Fuentes and his gang likely will successfully hammer the Jewishness of his accuser, and this will cause the spotlight to dim quickly. Our Democracy doesn’t do well in the sunlight.Congressional Republicans, of course, were unaware of the changed landscape until servicing their diminished leftist masters provoked a major backlash. It is hard to imagine Charles Grassley shit posting, but some younger GOP members of Congress seamlessly transitioned yesterday to doing so after earlier defending online their whoring. The new guns may be able to muster a successful show trial or two themselves.*Duke’s fame exploded in the age of Jerry Springer, but he somehow managed to make the transition to the age of Fuentes and AOC, and continues to attention whore on the platforms of minor e-celebrities. Credit where credit due there. Is there any way AOC/Fuentes will thrive in the next Big Top? Doubtful.
