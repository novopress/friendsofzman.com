        J. Wilson: I saw your comment on AD and would have chimed in my agreement but can’t get past the registration requirement.It’s a nasty business all around.  Twould be nice were it as cut and dried as Thermopylae where we could  at least have had the satisfaction of a good hard fight alongside a truly brave leader, Leonidas.  How to suffer death by a thousand cuts is the worst abomination.  You know you are being beaten but like those dreams where you have the utmost urgency to move and absolutely cannot you fall through fear into dread and on into despair.  Vanderleun and Zman and many others ring the alarm but obviously the Zombie apocalypse is full on us.  As I say, you might as well go piss up a rope. You’ll have better luck.

        A similar mix of beliefs in the comments on American Digest, which linked the post. Mine was in agreement with you and Will, the losing side of history–“It came to the South–for the worst of reasons–to defend the principle of the old republic–federal government limited and clearly enumerated; and for the North, in order that it may oppose a great evil, to create another great evil.We are now wobbling at the precipice of the surviving evil, and any conservative who by this time thinks we are not falling in is a fool. Optimism is cowardice.Tocqueville-I have made a distinction between two types of centralization; the one called governmental, the other administrative. The first exists solely in America; the second is almost unknown there. In the United States, the majority, which often has despotic tastes and instincts, still lacks the most developed tools of tyranny.If the direction authority in American societies took…combined the right of total command with the capacity of total execution…freedom would soon be obliterated in the New World.”The Founders undertook to solve the issues that led to the dissolution of previous democracies and republics, and established solutions never before thought of. But the greatest challenge was in addressing the enormous size of the new republic. Montesquieu, one of their most revered scholars, was unequivocal  in believing that one thing a republic could not be was large. The ingenious restraints placed on the central government by the Founders were removed in 1865, and we see the result. But like the cooking lobster we do not appreciate how inevitable our failure has become.

        First, don’t presume you speak for all the of the people in the South. How do you know what, even if you’re from here, what everybody here thinks? I’ll speak for myself, thank you. “Normal” people(as you put it) in the South, do have VERY deep feelings about the Confederate Flag. That flag, isn’t about slavery. It’s the original flag of those in this country who understand/stood, that it’s THESE United States, not THE United States. It’s the original flag of those of us who have had too much of a central, all powerful government telling us(the States) what we can and can’t do. Slavery wasn’t the real issue, it was the central government telling the States what they could or couldn’t do. Make no mistake, I’m not defending slavery, I’m defending, as were the States the seceded, the right of a State to make it’s own decisions as to what was acceptable to the people of that State. I would have thought that at this point in history, with all the information that is available to us at the click of a mouse, this would no longer be an issue that people STILL didn’t understand. I totally support the flying of the Confederate flag. It doesn’t mean I support slavery(I don’t), it means I support the RIGHTS of the States to determine for themselves which laws they will enact and how they, as INDIVIDUAL States of a greater Union, will behave within their own State. It means I believe that the Federal government should be restricted, as it is spelled out in the Constitution, to the specific duties spelled out for the Federal government BY the Constitution. It’s really not that hard of a concept. The Constitution says the Federal government is responsible for this, that and the other and that everything else was relegated to the States. That’s what the Civil War was about, it wasn’t slavery as an institution so much as it was the States having the right, according to the Constitution, to make it’s own decisions according to what that State wanted. Slavery was just one of several specific examples of when the Federal Government stepped in and said “No, we won’t allow you to do that”. The Confederate States, following the example of our Forefathers, said “Okay, if you’re(the FEDGOV) not going to play by the rules we all agreed to, then we will remove ourselves from the Union that makes us answerable to those rules.” Why am I STILL having to explain this to people? If any of you are truly the Patriots you purport yourselves to be, you’ll (a) get educated about the subject, and (b) stop being a stinking hypocrite about the Confederate Flag.

            Agreed, Will.  Of all the posts here this is the most disturbing, filled as it is with supercilious condescension salted with vitriol vis-à-vis an icon of a great number of people who would be fellow travelers with our host.  Now I don’t think I’ve ever had a Confederate flag but every iteration of the revisionist’s efforts to abolish it and other symbols of true Liberty gets my goat real gud!  Zman defiles it and the “red neck outcasts” that display it in the same breath he condemns those that want to erase it from memory.  Only reason I didn’t chime in before is cause I don’t see the need to go pissin up a rope but I had to give you, of all the other commenters, kudos for speaking my mind.  Zman is who he is and overall I like the cut of his jib.

        Before expounding on the “real” reasons that War broke out Between the States, please read the expositions and speeches of the Commissioners sent by the governments of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, and South Carolina to the people and governments of Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Texas, here:

            Thanks for this.  My reply to those who say the Slave states seceded over states rights is to read the various and sundry Declaration of Causes of Seceding States.Mississippiminced the fewest words:Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery– the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.Like with the debates over the 14th Amendment, no one ever wants to do the research, which is pretty darn easy today with the InnerWeb.

                You’ll note that I made no mention of what the South thought said or did prior to the War. I made no mention of the Carthaginian positions either. I’m sure they made blunders too.
The focus here is on the people threatening to blow up the Jefferson Memorial right now, in 2015. I’m drawing a line between them and their antecedents in the abolitionist movement, who were our first social justice warriors.

                    No swipe at you, Z.  I noticed that others were starting to bring up the “but the Civil War was really about” arguments.  Like you, I am a big believer in the scientific method, primary sources, comparative cultural studies, and all of the other stuff that got us from the Dark Ages to twerking and near-zero constraints on human perversity.And I don’t have much problem with the Confederate Battle Flag.  By giving Southern vets something to rally around and honoring something true and morally and politically neutral (rebel military prowess), it probably helped aid the process of healing and reconciliation after the war.  In the old Soviet sense of the word, it was “progressive.”

            I think you are missing the point. I really don’t care what the South thought, which is why I never mentioned it. It has no bearing on the point I’m making. I’m sure most Southern Whites have strong feelings about their culture today, but that has nothing to do with why Liberal Whites make war on them.
If you want to write an essay about how the South stupidly played into the hands of the North and brought destruction on themselves, I’ll read it, but it has nothing to do with the topic at hand.

        Z-man, (don’t know your name so please excuse the abbreviation)I have been reading your superb blog for a long time now and admire your ability to get to the heart of the matter.One quibble; the southern culture that fought the American Civil War was descended from the English Cavaliers. It was a continuation of the English Civil War and it was indeed baked into the country’s founding. The Scots-Irish were divided on the subject and took sides according to circumstance.One ray of hope; my ancestors were Puritan Yankees, going back to the 1600’s. Today, I find myself and many of my family deeply alienated from the cult. If it ever comes to blows again, I will stand with the core against them.

        Not sure the Romans kept going back until they won. As far as I know the Roman army took a hell of a beating in what is now Germany so they simply drew the line at the bottom edge of the Rhine. Same with Scotland: easier to build a wall than risk losing a legion.
I accept that every nation has to define boundaries somewhere (a boundary-less world is uncomfortable, to say the least) but not sure the Romans were always as up for the fight as you say, Z.

            There are exception to just about all rules. What makes Augustus unique is he took a radically different lesson away from the battle of the Tuetoburg Forrest than his predecessors. Rather than raise new legions and attack the Germans, he decided the Empire had reached its limit. That’s what made him Augustus.
I’ll also note that after Augustus died, Germanicus was sent in to exact revenge, which he did. The Romans killed everything that walked or crawled in that region. They also claimed to have recovered the bones of their fallen men and buried them.

        The “Third Punic War” was simply the Romans destroying  a already defeated Carthage.
The Phoenicians/Punics were the the  great merchants from antiquity, the original capitalists, Carthage and its colonies remained extremely wealth even after the defeats to Rome and this anoyed the Romans to no end, this is way the Third Punic War happened, Romans couldn’t tolerate Carthage prosperity even if they’re already subjugated to Rome.

            That’s the point. Carthage, in the minds of the Romans, remained a threat long after it was a military or economic threat. It’s very existence was a threat. Similarly, that stupid flag is no threat to the Cult. But it i exists and that’s what matters.

        The argument over the causes of the Civil War has consumed numerous forests, but I think you have it wrong. The conflict was baked into the original structure of the nation and bound to come to a head. There was no way the northern states had the political muscle to eliminate slavery. But they had no obligation to allow slavery in new states. Tlhe south was on the losing end of westward expansion. They weren’t going to sit idly by and watch their position deteriorate.

        This is the Lefts second War on the South, the bastion of conservative culture and traditional values. I’m not saying that conservative values includes acceptance of slavery or racial discrimination, because it doesn’t. This War, led by the Leftist Hive, is to eviscerate any hold-out conservatives in the nation. I think they’re picking on the wrong crowd.

            Good point, Kathleen, about “the hive” picking a fight with Southerners.
Those toothless “drones” in their hive may well have picked a fight with some real nasty stinging hornets. The “hive” doesn’t seem to remember hornets can sting multiple times, as opposed to bees.
The collective Northern hive’s hue and cry is: “you’ll hear from my lawyers,” whereas Southerners are more apt to “right” things much more quickly, cleanly, and cheaply albeit more painfully to the “hivers.”
