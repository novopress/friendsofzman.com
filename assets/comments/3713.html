        Some folks just do that sort of thing. Preaching on street corners type of stuff. We are all liable to that exposure more than we used to be. Used to, you could just take a jog over to the next parallel street to avoid them. Now, one click and you done been mooned.
Oh, incidentally, there never has been a “greatest generation” and there never will be. That whole thing about “greatest generation” was invented by Tom Brokaw.

        My Dad had four sisters, two of them twins not much older than myself. They delighted in serving as big sisters for me and reminded me of that right up until they passed away.Their unconditional love and loyalty was a road map for me in dealing with and understanding women. My successful marriage turns forty this year and I owe them a large measure for that.Women are the soul and conscience of society. When they lose their way we become adrift with no wind in our sails and a broken rudder. Such is the perilous state of our current situation.

        The really astonishing thing about the overeducated Ms JGU is the privileged background – and the privileged existence.  Graduate of Tufts.  Internships.  Graduate schools.   Close friends with a global reach (scan the bios of the wedding party….Shabbat included as part of  the services, unsurprisingly)These are not your father’s nutjob professional protester who goes back to his one room SRO with a hotplate.  These are the type of people who will run my life in my dotage  (I’m about 2/3 thru my run given typical actuarial tables, FYI) and it scares the pants off me.Where did these people come from?http://mattandjennifer.com/bridalparty/https://twitter.com/uffalhttps://twitter.com/jennyalyse

        This “rape culture” fantasy is a navel-gazing group hysteria.But apparently she is getting paid to write about it by several sites. Amazing!It feels like we’re standing way back in the crowd at the new Salem witch trials, and and this woman is one of the neurotic biddies standing up front, screeching in Cotton Mather’s ear to burn all the warlocks NOW !Are we being engineered into this frenzy?  Is she just somebody’s tool?  She gets paid for pageviews, so if vicious ‘the-sky-is-falling’ swill sells, that’s what Yahoo wants her to write?You really have to be unmoored from reality and history to latch onto these ideas.We have raised a generation of ignorant Chicken Littles, who somehow believe that their lumpen feelings trump reality.And so we get this pack of mean little monkeys, all nipping and biting and screaming incoherently, flinging feces at each other. Then, like all jungle creatures, for a while they feed and groom, and mate, etc. – –  until the next eruption occurs.Maybe we should require all adults to simply carry a weapon of some kind – like a derringer, a utility knife (a razor), a wristband taser. Or more, if that’s your style, doesn’t really matter what’s in hand as long it can do some permanent damage to someone who’s picking on you.I bet all these frivolous rape claims would drop like a rock. And then the real cases would quickly fall, too. Sure, we’d have to contend with a smattering of justifiable-homicide cases for a while, but that’s a self-cleaning oven.

        There have always been weirdos but their damage in the past was rather limited to where they could walk or take the bus. Today the weirdos can use technology to connect to their kind wherever. Methinks the population of weirdos has increased with tech advances, feeling bold behind their screens. Oy.

        “Lack of bystander action”, a contributing cause of “rape culture”?  Can it get any more foolish?  I guess it truly is the end of days.  Come the grid-down these nut-cakes will be the first to perish as they apparently have no useful skills or reason for being.

        Well I’m old too.  All my aunts, uncles, parents and grandparents went through a 11 year depression followed by a four year war.  They were more serious people after experiencing real world problems that most of us today are protected from.  I gotta feeling though that we are going to once again as a nation be tested and if we survive it we will have another “great generation” to steer us for 30 + years.
