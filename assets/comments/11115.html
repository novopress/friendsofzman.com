        You brought up two good points but failed to link them, Z. You discussed how people came to the mountain top of the dissident right; and you discussed cucks.I was a cuck once, or even a zeta male. My family life was shit because mine was an extended family with the in laws involved in everything we did. My mother in law was a loud, domineering bitch. My father in law was a beaten down beta male that drank too much and spent his sober moments signalling his virtue. I put up with them for 30 years because I loved my wife and daughter, and they loved the in laws. They weren’t always like that, it slowly got that way over the years. When confronted with their bullshit, I just grit my teeth and did what I could to keep my family together. Years and decades went by like that, and I just accepted shitty in laws as the price to be paid for family.When my daughter discovered she was gay, she and her creepy girlfriend decided that the whole family would have to be redefined to fit their sexuality… it fell apart in one day. I got a manifesto of terms, conditions, and ultimatums on how this new family would work, and how she and her love partner would henceforth call the shots in the family. I would be told what I could say and think, and of course my in laws agreed and fell over themselves to celebrate and embrace her sexuality. I couldn’t believe it – it was the stuff of lunacy … and overnight my family was over. 30 + years…gone. I figured I’d make it a hat trick and told my wife she could come with me or go with them… and it almost breaks me up still. She came with me, and at least my marriage held.You are right in that getting here often involves huge losses. A lot of those cucks are guys still struggling to carry impossible loads, waiting for that final straw. Try to be nice to cucks, they will be our allies sooner or later, it is just a matter of time. Real men can’t survive in prog families forever.

            Dear lord.  You have the patience of Job.  I’m glad your wife stayed by your side, and I hope your daughter eventually comes to her senses regarding appropriate boundaries.  As for the in laws….well played sir.

            What you have said is really, I believe, a metaphor for what Males have done in this country for decades. I think there is coming a time where we just won’t play anymore by their rules.

            I was a cuckservative, I just didn’t know it, until Kevin Wiliamson’s attack piece on people like me. That’s when I knew that Trump was my guy. From then on, the expression “principled conservative” made me sick. I’m not a conservative; I’m just a person who hates Leftists and those who “service” them.
As for Trump, well, he is what he is. He’s just a guy who ISN’T a cypher of the global masters.

        I’m not sure why you have problems with your podcast. Seemed fine to me. A lot of it is a summary of a lot stuff that a few of us know but not every one knows this stuff. I think you’re being overly critical of yourself for no reason.The reason no one is making a deal about Debbie Wasserman Schultz is there’s a LOT of them being blackmailed. I’ve read at least 30%. I of course don’t know but there’s a huge amount of evidence that it’s a lot.Now this may be good for the Spaths running the country but it’s like you said, fragile. All it would take would be aggressive investigation using the same “anti-terrorism” legislation that they put on place to terrorize us and they would be ruined. If I was Trump I would get a hold of this evidence, start blackmailing the Representatives myself and kill off all the other blackmailers. Who are they going to complain to?

                    Yes I think Bob has it. Zman if you don’t enjoy it you should stop. I would hate for you to take on too much and then get sick of the whole thing and quit blogging all together.

                I’ve been quietly following you for the last year, and followed Derb for years, so I was curious how original your podcast was going to be, but liked your blog, so figured I would follow for a while.  Reading is faster but more reflective at the same time, so I prefer blogs, but I must say, I thought you absolutely nailed it this week, and are becoming more original.  Congrats and keep it up, I should think I will not be alone in my assessment, so maybe that will help provide incentive.  Thanks!

        Jeez, Z-man, you’re too hard on yourself.  What you have to say is interesting, and you’re an important guy on the team.  Great show!
BTW nobody mentions audio quality anymore, so you can tell that’s dialed-in too.

        Pro tip, I’d only do Perfunctory Opening Comments as blog text.
Why? Because it becomes immediately outdated, those first three minutes, and irrelevant to people who will listen to the z cast backlog in the future.
It will irrelevant to hear that you are now on itunes, to someone who will listen in two months on itunes. As someone who listened to many pod’ backlogs, stuff like that always bothered me, but maybe it’s just me.

        All very good. Several were great. Loved the Schultz in particular. Would it be possible in the future to copy a link for individual segments? I would be lobbing segments like bombs at individual targets who wouldn’t listen to an hour, which is why they need targeting in the first place.

            While I am a supporter of the Back To Africa Movement, I would settle for a return to private discrimination. A white population that is intolerant of black misbehavior worked through the first half of the twentieth century. It make the lives of blacks better too.

                Dupont Circle is right. For Whites to re-impose their will on Blacks would require something close to a race war. Separation of some sort is probably better.The problem with sending Blacks back to Africa is that the poor bastards would probably die or be killed by native Africans. Giving them a piece of the South might be more workable, and could be accomplished at least in part by a series of financial incentives such as making it so that EBT cards work only in certain select parts of the country. Additional funds can be provided for the costs of relocation, of course.My fellow Southerners will grumble about this, of course, but will probably just pull up stakes and move as more and more Blacks pour into the area.Once most Blacks live on what will in effect be a reservation, the rest will simply be a problem of control and containment. The better their behavior and the lower their birth rates, the more free stuff they will get.

Hell no. The South had laws to control them somewhat and guys in the North didn’t like that. Thought you knew better. They all should be sent to areas where they want “diversity”. Every last one. You overrode the laws controlling them you should take them.

                        The history of European peoples is full of population transfers, some of which were accomplished without undue bloodshed. That which has been done before may be done again.
Besides, I do not hate Blacks enough to force them to live among Yankees.

                    Send the blacks back north where the majority of them lived prior to the Northern War of Aggression to Stop Southern Liberty.
The 1860 census identified a majority of negroes living in the northern states.
Send them all to Massachusetts to wax Barney Frank’s ass or something

                    Ultimately, the nationalist trend gathering steam all around the world is going to include American blacks. Who are not African, any more than American whites are European. They are now their own unique nation, distinct physically and culturally.“Giving them a piece of the South might be more workable,”That solution seems ungenerous. I propose Manhattan ($3T value) in the East, and a territory in the West centered on Oakland, extending up into Marin, East into Pleasanton, South through Silicon Valley to the edge of San Jose, and west to San Francisco (probably similar $3T value).Manhattan is actually less than ideal for several reasons, but if the manhattanites donate enough, the Greater Washington DC area contains many of America’s richest counties, and could be substituted along with Baltimore and chunks of Maryland (sorry Z) and PA up to Philadelphia in the East. That’s the better solution anyway, and if the Manhattanites have to pay to make it happen, they’ll also propagandize on its behalf. Certain limited spots in DC would remain American territory – Arlington National Cemetary and Quantico, for instance. DC would remain America’s capitol for the federal government, and would pay negotiated leases for its footprint under a 99-year agreement that has a formula for proportionality if that footprint grows or shrinks.The slate is wiped clean from slavery, and the new states inherit rich areas with high-skill populations who will, i’m sure, be very committed to making the new states work. The opportunities for Silicon Valley diversity alone are sufficient to justify the proposal.

                A return to private discrimination would, of course, work both ways and could be tremendously beneficial – blacks could then have blacks-only nightclubs, blacks-only restaurants, blacks-only hotels, apartment buildings and banks, if the owners of those businesses and their customers desired it, and many would.  An America that was at liberty to self-segregate when individuals wished to do so would almost certainly result in a more stable and harmonious society, and a more prosperous one; although anything would be better than the current miserable status quo of racial animosity fed by arbitrary and one-sided government-imposed mandates and the enforced dependencies that result from them.

        Well, shit, if that is “bad”, will take it over good in about every other podcast all day long.  On Detroit.  Did a tour of Detroit during the Coleman Young years (“he be the mayor, king of all in Detroit town, he’s always on the social scene, drivin’ up in his limousine, he’ll meet, eat, talk and chat and cut deals behind the council’s back…”—went the radio jingle).  Worked with a fair number of black finance guys–to a person, all were kids of blue collar auto workers who originally lived in Detroit and were the black middle class.  And to a person, there parents (note the plural) got the fuck out of Dodge after the riots.  The black middle class left too–or moved the area bordering Grosse Pointe.  What you were left with the sociological equivalent of #6 fuel oil.  On cuck-servatives.  There is a wonderful line in the movie “Cromwell”, where, after reciting the list of Puritan grievances  to Charles I, Cromwell is admonished for being “impertinent”.  His reply?  “The issues, sir, are beyond “good manners””.  We’re there.  The hive mind of the Progressives decided long ago to yield no ground.  No reason to oblige them any further.  On athletics, genetics is destiny.  Rowed at the elite level for many years.  The simple bio mechanics of being over 6′, long armed, 80% slow twitch and possessing a (largely inherited–according to the docs and Penn’s human performance lab) off the charts VO2 max meant I was simply going to beat a 5’8″ guy with normal limb lengths, no matter how hard he trained.  10,000 hours will make you very competent at something, but it won’t win a national championship.

        Regarding the quality of the cast, they had an old saying in the Army: Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Sometimes people tinker trying to get perfection and rather than spending six months to make a B- album, book, or movie, they spend a decade  to produce something that’s still only a B-. I call it the Chinese Democracy phenomenon.

        I think it is Amazon coming with a new series ,Black America.
The aftermath of the Civil War played out differently: “Black America,”set in a contemporary society, envisions a timeline in which freed black Americans formed a sovereign nation out of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama as post-Reconstruction reparations for slavery.
Should be interesting how well they are portrayed.Next up, the true history of the people of a certain color, “We wuz Kangs!”

        We should start placing bets on which minute mark you’re going to mention your age!Regarding blacks exploding into gleeful destruction after a steady build up of tension, what’s the potential for the same thing happening among whites, or some subset of whites? I’m thinking of the shouts during the after party or the way our 20-somethings looked like hunting dogs waiting to be released on an antifa chase.The upcoming Unite the Right event is shaping up to be a “Battle of Berkeley” street scuffle. Are these ritualistic combat displays good, bad, or indifferent?Don’t feel obligated to formulate an answer now, but I’m sure your thoughts would be interesting if you’d care to incorporate them into a post or the next podcast.

        I have worked in the ghetto, as a cop for over 20 years. I appreciate your blog ZMan.
It’s funny how expecting blacks to be more like whites, AKA civilized, is somehow a bad thing.
By and large, at this particular time in history, most of the creatures I come in contact with have the constitution of an Orc.
They’re animals.
That’s not going to change in our lifetime.

        Saml Adams,Liked the number 6 FO reference, I could quibble technically, but why ruin the fun.On talent, John McEnroe, himself prodigiously talented, had nothing but bad mouthing for Ivan Lendl.  However, Lendl could reportedly solve Rubik’s cube in less than one minute from any initial position.  His tennis reflected that understanding – the man could really hit the angles on the court.  But he still had to work very hard.Z,Nice ‘cast, your best yet.  On race in college admissions, some of us old farts can remember the magic year when race was not on the admissions menu.  Prior to 1967 an applicant had to include a photo, and there was a question on religious affiliation for most colleges.  In 1967, no photos and no questions – against the law to ask.  In 1968 it was mandatory to ask the race of an applicant.  Go figure.

        Enjoy the podcast although still like reading the blog.Things would run a lot more smoother in this country without the forced integration.
However don’t see how that’s possible since they are forces in play that seem hell-bent on spreading diversity in every corner of the world.
Watched the TV for five minutes today (  trying to catch the weather ) and some show was on gushing about a black pop band coming out of Norway.
