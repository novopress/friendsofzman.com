        […] The other day I made the point that the the Greek drama was about erasing countries from the map of Europe. Everyone is going to pretend for a while that Greece is a real country, but eventually even the dumbest Greek will figure out that their national government is meaningless. The real power lies much further north and they are not all that interested in what the Greek voters have to say about anything. You don’t have citizens without countries. […]

        […] &quot;It’s a fascinating thing in that most people, including me, thought the Greek crisis was a threat to the EU model. It is turning out to be a confirmation of the model.&quot; […]

        When was first time you heard a sneering prog, full of condescension and self-righteousness, say something like:  “Where am I from?  Well I BORN in Pennsylvania, if that’s what you mean.  But I consider myself a Citizen of the World.”  (Under their breath adding  “nationality?   I am so far above that.  That’s for simple-minded little people.  The cannon fodder.”)20 years?  25?   30?  Not long, relatively speaking.   It’s metastasized so fast we now have a President and most European leaders fully in the camp.I’ve long maintained that the Chinese historians a century from now will be amazed to learn that early in the new millenium  the president of the strongest nation on earth deep down actually HATED his own country.    I’m sure there must be precedence, but I am unaware.  And if so, it was surely small potatoes, like South Succotash.   Nothing on the order of a global superpower.

            A fair number of Roman emperors hated Rome and its people. Nero spent all of his time mocking Roman customs. That was a guy who truly hated his people. But, Nero was a nut so perhaps that’s a bad example. We do seem to be an exception in that our entire ruling elite is trying to destroy that which holds them up in the elite.
