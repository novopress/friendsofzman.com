        Z, I really appreciate the David French segment. I‚Äôve been thinking it‚Äôs about time.  Thanks.
If you think Lizzo is bad look up ‚Äòdeclononizing ballet‚Äô. Yep, it‚Äôs exactly what you think‚Ä¶ twerking in ballet shoes. Very vibrant.

        Nothing screams conservative buffoonery quite like the article on Lizzo‚Äôs shenanigans.  ‚ÄúTrue, her performance was vulgar. But she showed a real reverence for American history.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot exactly Thucydides but closer to him than anything I have ever heard at a concert.‚ÄùWhere to begin?  The epitome of lowbrow mid-wittery is to cite a distinguished figure of the past and then pretend he is being invoked during a burlesque concert.  It‚Äôs the conservative version of virtue signaling ‚Äì an empty display of pseudo-intellectual cultural posturing.  I defy the journalist to explain what Thucydides wrote and how he influenced Western civilization.  Previous generations would have been as much mortified by this poser‚Äôs pompous self-importance as Lizzo‚Äôs vulgarity.

        Herschel Walker;  ü§°üòÇ
In today‚Äôs episode of Burn the Coal, pay the Toll ; we present the GOP and Family Values man Herschel Huxtable Walker.  Apparently his RW son got sick of hiding Daddy‚Äôs Transcontinental Baby Mama‚Äôs and an abortion in 2009.

            Conservatives, especially politicians, who are vocally anti-abortion yet secretly insist on abortions in their personal lives are the worst hypocrites in the world.  It‚Äôs worse hypocrisy than even anti-gun Liberals with armed bodyguards.

        Unless super necessary in the heat of all-out war, damaging or blowing up a bridge is one of the dickiest moves in the book.   It‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre gonna fight the neighborhood tough guy and agree on the parameters:  ‚ÄúOK, ground rules.  No pulling hair, eye gouging, or kicks to the balls.  Say ‚Äúuncle‚Äù and we break.‚ÄùFirst thing he does is kick you in the balls. Gets in his Camaro and drives off.Worst thing is your friends staring down at you don‚Äôt even sympathize.‚ÄúHe broke the rules.  He lost!‚Äù‚ÄúHe lost?  Who‚Äôs the one squirming around on the ground right now?‚Äù

        Z Man mentioned the Ace of Spades blog.  I realized that I hadn‚Äôt thought of or visited that blog in years.  That blog was interesting because the writers know that Republicans are useful idiots, useless cowards or paid traitors but the writers absolutely refuse to acknowledge racial reality.
In doing a bit of catching up on the blog, I found this claim from 10 years ago that Ace is a woman:https://www.breitbartunmasked.com/2012/03/29/ace-spades-hq-unmasked/.  Anyone know if this is true?
Anyone who follows Ace have any comments on the current state of the blog?

                I find the disappearance of your 3 hour podcast/interview quite remarkable.Surely common decency would require some explanation. Pissing away 3 hours of your time would seem to be more typical of the Wokels than the Right.

                    It does not go unnoticed. Look around our space and find anyone that mentions me. I promote their stuff all the time, but it is a one way street. I just do what I do and try not to notice the lack of reciprocation.

                        Ploppy, I agree with your judgement on a theoretical level but on a practical level comparing the blacks and the tribe is a false equivalence.  The tribe is very wealthy and powerful, the blacks, not so much.
In my view, one‚Äôs stance on this issue of the tribe depends on your personal guess as to the likelihood of winning the support of some members of the tribe who are willing to go against most of their group.  For me, I think the chances of this are small and my outlook reflects that.

                        @LineInTheSand: It‚Äôs a virtually impossible sell as you‚Äôre asking them to relinquish their privileged status, especially when most of them are convinced that it‚Äôs a slippery slope that leads into a cattle car.
The only convincing argument I can think of would be to a middle-class Jew, pointing out that once the rich Jews finally pissed the Germans off enough it was the middle-class ones that ended up taking the heat after their rich co-ethnics got the hell out of there.

        Off Topic:  Not to claim this is equivalent re blowing up of the Crimean bridge, but . . . just a warning for those who feel they can totally rely on their local sheriffs to protect them from fed overreach.  Found the following comment today at an open forum on a blog:However at a recent gun show in Great Falls Montana the ATF agents and Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigators wereseen recording Canadian license plate numbers.The Constitutional Sheriff was more than a little pissed off since neither agency had informed him of their presence.He was somad that after making it clear that he was the top LEO in the city and the county the ATF agents were escorted from theproperty and the RCMP were escorted out of the USA.*********************After much searching I was able to confirm this.  Per newspaper story, local Sheriff was never informed of this operation or of the fed/Canadian official presence.  Supposed purpose was to combat ‚Äògun smuggling.‚Äô  No matter where you are or what you do or what you buy, you are being monitored.  Just more fuel for the fire.https://www.montanarightnow.com/great-falls/canadian-police-found-in-undercover-operation-at-great-falls-gunshow/article_faa71f0e-3f84-11ed-8331-23bd335a2466.html

                I hope any Canadians planning to transport firearms across the border fully comply with their laws. I know that bringing firearms into the USA (without proper paperwork) is quite a serious offense. I doubt Canadia would be any looser.

            For what it‚Äôs worth, ATFE gun show antics have been going on for decades.  Witnessed one myself perhaps 10-15 years ago.  I even went back to the show organizers and explained what was happening‚Äîillicit buys by agents at the show.  The organizers then broadcast the details to the show retailers and audience.  Not sure what happened after as I went home.

        Large explosion on the Kerch Straits bridge, fuel tank cars, I suspect sabotage. Damage on one side of the bridge, other side being assessed, fatalities reported. Ukrainian government officials gloating.
Oh, boy, here we go, as this was an attack on Russian soil. Now the gloves will come off big time.

            Further report from RIA, that the explosion was in a truck alongside of the freight train. Whole bridge is under video surveillance, so the bomb was not in the train, but the fire is a result of the detonation next to the fuel cars.

                If that was the case it was either a suicide bomb attack, or a remote detonation of a payload that the drivers of the vehicles were unaware of and probably told they were delivering the explosives to a place inside Crimea.
Suicide bomb seems unlikely in the west.

            Alongside that, Deep State tool Adam Kinzinger, Liz Cheney pal, wants Elon Musk investigated for Starlink failures. There is a coordinated push to have Musk stripped of all his companies by the Woke, who seem him as an enemy. Musk noted he lost $80 million running Ukranian Starlink terminals. Very likely the loss of Starlink terminals is related to Russian electronic warfare which is generally good. But I do not think the Deep State will allow Musk to buy Twitter, and that presents a challenge as our only ability to launch satellites into space at SCALE is Musk. Not Bezos and not the US Air Force. That would fit right in with one-step thinking. Blow up the Nordstream pipelines and prevent Germany from making deals with Russia ‚Äî at the predictable cost of the falling apart of the EU as without German money from the Mittelstand there is no subsidies for the periphery.And, the CIA has now been outed in the Intercept of running a massive covert military operation. The things I did not understand are now somewhat clearer, the ‚ÄúUkranians‚Äù advancing are really US Special forces and elements of US armored divisions. Putin and his people are saying and doing nothing to growing frustration in Russia. Either Putin suddenly took stupid pills or something is up for sure. Putin‚Äôs relative restraint has been to get the Global South on his side which he generally has: the Saudis are joining the BRICS, India is neutral, so is Indonesia, Africa is mostly pro-Russian as is Latin America and Oceana. China is his partner facing Regime Change as well.

                For those with Telegram access, the AZGeopolitics channel just posted still images from a GoPro purportedly taken from a dead Western mercenary.
In the posted images, one can see German, English, Polish, and even American flags and insignia.
If these images are real, they wpuld seem to confirm the idea that there are significant numbers of NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine.

        Hey gang, here is a thought that just zoomed in to me from left field.
Be grateful. Had this evil demented satanist in the White House been our ruler in 1962 instead of 2022, we probably wouldn‚Äôt be here today bemoaning the sorry state of affairs.
I have a feeling that that feeling of gratitude won‚Äôt be repeated 60 years hence, in 2084, when the glory of Western Civilization has long since been forgotten.

        ZMan mentions poverty.
There are still plenty of poor people around. They congregate in public libraries during the day and on the street at night. In my city, Vancouver, there is an entire section of the city‚Äìthe Downtown Eastside‚Äìdedicated to living the poverty life. There, cheap drugs and ruinous lifestyles combine to make life OD-short. The city tolerates it because it is a Left-Wing institution through and through. Any other basis for reality would clean it up at once as the disease-infested blight it is.

        There is good creative music out there. Give King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard a try. Australian neo-psychedelic prog metal band with a vast output considering they‚Äôve only been around a dozen years. A bit too heavy for my tastes but most definitely not cookie-cutter.
On another end of the spectrum there‚Äôs Billy Strings. Amazing young (just turned 30) guitar picker, singer, and songwriter from rural Michigan who has definitely lived it. Hottest thing in bluegrass music.
Yes there‚Äôs a lot of crap out there but also plenty of creative music of all types if you know where to look.

            Brandon Lasko: ‚ÄúThere is good creative music out there.‚ÄùSerious Question: What is the last charting song you can remember which had a definable recognizable repeatable singable melody to it?A few years ago, I got very interested in music edumakashun for youngish children [pre-teens and early teens], and I went looking for ‚ÄúPop‚Äù tunes which kids could play on their band instruments.I listened to about twenty years‚Äô worth of Billboard Top 10 hits [about 200 songs in totum], via their j00t00b videos, and at the end of the exhausting exasperating frankly embarrassing and dadgum near about excruciating experiment, I found precisely ONE song which had a clear and unambiguous melody to it, with lyrics which you could decipher and re-create with your own voice [not to mention your band instrument]:‚ÄúHey There Delilah‚Äùby Tom Higgenshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_There_DelilahIt was number one for two weeks in 2007:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number_ones_of_2007Two closing thoughts:1) The vast majority of ‚Äúmusic‚Äù now being played by school bands in this country is heavily-rhythmic non-melodic non-harmonic non-contrapuntal pseudo-african noise with no connection whatsoever to the musical legacy of classical Western Civilization.2) Despite having written the only serious love song in two decades, Tom Higgens never managed to get within a country mile of Delilah DiCrescenzo‚Äôs nether regions.THOTs gonna THOT.And coal burners gonna burn coal.

Our tuba player sang the vocals [extremely well], and another dude, whom I barely knew, stepped up to the plate and nailed the Terry Kath guitar solo [which rather shocked me].
On the urban side of things, Terry Kath at Tanglewood was arguably Peak Boomer.

                I don‚Äôt get adults going on about pop music. Its similar to adults and sports it seems to me.
Its music to infantilize that should be put away later on in life and one should recognize that the vast majority has been used as a weapon to undermine western tradition.
However much one tries to expand on and alter the pushed africanization you still end up swallowing poison and the removal of melody and replacement of your own roots.
They repeat this pattern over and over, and no one ever seems to learn the lesson.

        Well said.  Something worth noting is the Youtube reaction video trend.  It might seem trivial, but watching someone listen to a great classic for the first time ‚Äì invariably an audience recommendation ‚Äì is oddly compelling and can make old songs feel almost new again.  Some of these channels have hundreds of thousands of followers and reach millions more.  Those people are having an impact.

Old enough to remember when the light of Christ was still honored as the highest law.

        Well written article. I think you missed a subsequent generation of musicians who were true artists ‚Äì that is people reporting fundamental human truths about their human experience. There were the GenXers from Seattle. I speak of the leading talents of the early 90s grunge scene. In order of talent:Chris CornellLane StaleyKurt CobainThe GenXers did experience poverty and something else. In the previous generation, divorce and broken families were an exception. For GenX it bore the brunt of the experiment with no fault divorce. There were many stable families turned upside down when Mim got bored. There is another experiment they and their fathers bore the brunt of ‚Äì deindustrialization. It was a tweezer generation for those like the aforementioned who were wayward and with broken families and Dads whose lumber and labor jobs who disappeared. They were supposed to go to college to succeed except the rules of tue world changed without wall st and the coastal elite telling them.The angst of them and those they spoke to was real ‚Äì not this ginned up carny act from kids who spent life since they were 3 on a lot at Disney.There is one more person from this generation of import ‚Äì Maynard James Keenan and Tool ‚Äì the same GenX angst plus child/sexual abuse. I think of all of them MJK is the most significant artist until he became desperate for relevance after going off to make wines and now he is a clown with TDS singing Imagine covers with a talentless guitar tech who he helped make famous.In any case. They were so angst ridden and forlorn that the first three died long before their generation will. If you have been to even late 90s Seattle you would understand. The cover for Soundgarden‚Äôs Superunknown is a great image for tue burning angst of throes kids whose lived in the shadow of the forest and whose lives were turned upside down by post 1960s American decline and attack on Heritage working class American men.Now country and metal are total carny acts. There is some talent here and there but country is a bunch of Nashville Disney lot kids and metal spoiled gamers pretending to have angst. There are a few diamonds in those roughs, but very hard to find.I think exciting times lay ahead for laying to rest the dead 60s counter culture detritus and creating an art that will express the rage in response to White Replacement, the race war and constructing a new regime with an aesthetic that is worthy of the higher.

                I think 13th Step is brilliant, but only as a text and the vocal performance. Without MJK‚Äôs genius for melody, dramatic form and a multi-layered dialectic I think Howerdel‚Äôs little nothings would be ‚Äì little nothings.

            PeriheliusLux: ‚ÄúI speak of the leading talents of the early 90s grunge scene.‚ÄùArguably no one realized it at the time [no one having foreseen the existential tone-deaf malaise &amp; noblesse-oblige treachery of the Bush family, nor the outright licentious lascivious perversions &amp; gluttonous larceny of Hillary &amp; Slick Willy &amp; Algore], but the 1980s were the final [and frankly the only] attempt at a serious top-down elitist-inspired clean-up &amp; white-washing of the cultural excesses of the 1960s &amp; 1970s.There were three major government initiatives of the 1980s designed to stem the tide of cultural filth &amp; nihilism &amp; despair:1) The 1986 Meese Commission on Pornography2) The 1987 initiative to add ‚ÄúSadistic Personality Disorder‚Äù to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [the ‚ÄúDSM‚Äù].3) Nancy Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Say No‚Äù to drugs advertising campaign.As much as people hated her, Nancy Reagan made real progress in altering public perceptions of narcotics use, and changed the prevailing cultural tenor concerning the use of narcotics, and for a very brief while, it looked like narcotics use was ackshually DECLINING.Then this radical young genius, named Kurt Cobain, burst onto the scene, and made heroin cool again, and inspired equally brilliant luminaries such as Heath Ledger &amp; Philip Seymour Hoffman to mimic him.Fast forward about 30 years, and the Sackler Family Crime Syndicate‚Äôs synthetic opioid poisoning of Middle Amurrikkkuh is now** the leading cause of death for young White males.And the combined efforts of billionaire sanhedrin Peter Lewis &amp; George Soros to legalize marijuana in various states has led to an explosion in Cluster A schizophrenia.===============**One could argue that the relentless public pressure to immunize children against d@mned near infinitely many different diseases [which the children would never have been in any danger of ackshually catching, nor suffering from] was part and parcel of a larger psychological warfare campaign being waged by the Medical Industrial Complex &amp; the Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex &amp; the Georgia Guidestones Depopulationists, which resulted in the 2021 COVID V@xxines of Death, and one could even argue that in a different [counter-historical] timeline, if Kurt Cobain had NOT been a junkie, then tens of millions of Amurrikkkun children might never have grown up to be adults acclimated to multiple purposeless hypodermic-needled inoculations every year, and, as adults, those tens of millions of Amurrikkkunz might have refused the COVID V@xxines of Death.Instead, in the timeline of ackshual Reality as it ackshually exists, we get ever more schizophrenia, ever more victims of the Sackler Family crime syndicate, ever more pericarditis, ever more myocarditis, and of course SADS.

                    I agree. The vast majority of 60s plus music is garbage. It has too low of a barrier to entry and is too easy to corrupt.The new forms we will create out of the wreckage are latent with something worthy of our past and our future.Imagine the latent talent of MJK and Cornell fused with the harmonic and rhythmic sophistication of western classical music and infusing say karnatic rhythm with our sensibility and taste with a message of conquest and dominion for our people‚Äôs glory. It will be magnificent. The sooner we can leave the vaudeville of rock and blues in the dust the better.Agreed W. Corliss

            I honestly think being despised and held in contempt is some sort of sexual fetish for him.  I know it‚Äôs also his actual JOB for the regime but he‚Äôs simply too enthusiastic for it to be all an act.
I‚Äôd bet cash money he films his wife with other men  or she crushes his testicles (nuremburg witness style) or makes him wear dirty diapers at home.  There‚Äôs no way a psychologically and sexually normal male rushes to debase himself to THAT extent.

        Of course modern feminism was pushed by the deep state in order to lower wages, increase taxes, de-stabilize the family, and gets kids in government schools earlier.But there is ONE fair point that feminists had:  Women *should* be paid a handsome wage for being a stay-at-home mom.  Taking care of kids is more labor intensive/stressful/boring than most jobs.  Most parents are relieved to get out of the house and get to work when there are kids at home; it‚Äôs like a vacation.A healthy and wholesome society would richly reward married women who stay at home to raise healthy kids.  It should be highly subsidized through taxes and housing.

        The apotheosis of post-modern musical expression in the West occurred in 1995.  In Norway, of all places.
If I remember correctly, Midjord once credited this performance for turning his white nationalism towards a more exterminationist bent.

            How long has this been the case though, really? If I was born in, say, 1700, was the world I moved in that different in 1760? I know on a geopolitical level, sure, things changed as always, but I think my children would have had more or less the same life I had.Today, people with 10-year age differences essentially live totally different lives. This trend is just accelerating rapidly, and the System encourages the division of people like this. The System also encourages people to hate the world that existed so it can refashion in its own image. Our minds and our civilization are not designed to handle this and the consequences are severe.

        Lovely intro on Lynn. The difference between Lynn and modern feminism is the femininity. Lynne‚Äôs feminism emphasized the resolve a woman needs to have to deal with a crappy husband or hopeless times. There was no attempt to usurp the role of man. Her feminism was still defined in relation to masculinity ‚Äì just often with a simultaneous attraction yet repulsion. She still loves the bad boy (as any real female does), but she hates his drinking. Modern feminism has nothing to do with femininity.This same reason is why I can enjoy Terminator 1 and 2 with a strong female lead. Linda Hamilton is still a woman, driven by that desire to protect her child. She is not stronger than the male component, but the love of her child drives her in a manner relatable to any good mother. The circumstances are fantasy, but the underlying core is still feminine. Plus, she looked like a tough mama ‚Äì but still a mama.Now, we have these 95 lb waif females that are on screen doing battle and defeating men twice their size. Think of the newest star wars crap (which I have not seen but have heard). This tiny chick is as strong as a 200 lb dude. You have to believe in magic like the force to swallow that crap. When I watch Linda Hamilton defend her baby, I can believe a momma could do that. When I hear Loretta sing about hard times, I know she was there. When I see some modern, empowered woman slay the evil man, I puke.

            I was just thinking how in first two terminators, Sarah was saving her son, who would be the savior. Kind of an empress Matilda or Eleanor of Aquitaine role. Very feminine. The male savior had to go, which is why they replaced john in the most recent movie with some androgynous beast. Sigh‚Ä¶.

        Jennifer Brown is one of the many reasons we are so damned unproductive.  If you want to know why we are incapable of building our own computers, something we invented, it‚Äôs all of the various hands in the pockets of companies who could make these things.Conservatives always get freaked out about Welfare.  But Ms Brown is far, far worse than any welfare recipient could ever be.  Ms Brown‚Äôs racket is you pay her a fortune to poison your company and make it far less productive.  There is an enormous army just full of people like Mx Brown making war on us at our own expense.  They are a cancer on society.

                        I read (but didn‚Äôt look into too much) that this is actually a standard tactic for debate teams from black universities these days. They essentially ignore the topic and put on a vulgar rap show about muh racism and muh oppression, and the cuck judges give them the award more often than not. I really wonder if this is redpilling any of the other debate teams, of course they won‚Äôt say so publicly.

        Canada is a great example of the immigration/refugee racket gone out of control.The biggest pathway at the moment is ‚Äúinternational students‚Äù. There are something like 700,000 ‚Äúinternational students‚Äù currently in Canada, mainly from India, Pakistan and Nigeria. Some of the colleges are real institutions, some of them exist for the sole purpose of ripping off international students and are a straight up cash-for-PR operation.The ‚Äústudents‚Äù pay some insane international fee, indebting them for life. They‚Äôre allowed to work for only 20 hours a week or something, so they usually work under the table for somebody from their own ethnic community ‚Äì working for less than minimum wage and more than 20 hours.They cheat their way through the program and learn nothing ‚Äì but their primary goal is to get Permanent Residence, not learn. Somehow at the end of this they get Permanent Residence which turns into citizenship 3 years later. Once they graduate there‚Äôs a flood of un-skilled grads who barely speak English. They either can‚Äôt get a job or end up working at Amazon warehouse. Enough do find a job that it‚Äôs cutting wages for Canadian skilled workers.Of course they need somewhere to live, and they‚Äôre broke. So they end up renting out flop houses 10 per house, usually owned by another person from their ethnicity.Look at the list of grads from a master‚Äôs program in any university. It‚Äôs not 30% international students‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs 100% international students. 500 Indians in one classroom.End result? Race to the bottom, directly to a third world country. Lowered wages, extreme housing costs, destroyed neighborhoods, degraded educational standards. A few landlords (most not even Canadian), banks, and colleges benefit in the short term. Long term, we all lose. This is just one facet of the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù immigration flood.

            This immigration flood has devastated my former hometowns in California. Not long ago, there were an estimated 5-6 million Trump voters in Cali. I can tell you that having been away from cali for 2 years, and visited over the summer, that there are almost no white people left in the bay area.They all left. The retail theft has gotten so out of control there that in just two years, I lost count of how many businesses got completely plundered and put out of business in my old hometown. The gangs are out of control, completely overwhelming the police force‚Äôs ability to do anything, so small crimes like retail theft go on almost un-checked.I moved to a major city in Utah, and- literally every single day- I meet several, fresh-off-the-plane Californians like myself who have fled the shitshow that progressive politics inevitably produces. Darn near all of these Californians are right-wing like myself- maybe 95%+ of them.So you can hate us- your new Californian neighbors- for our stylish clothes, our pretentious attitudes, and the fact that your women hound us RELENTLESSLY, and we become instantly popular (i‚Äôm sorry, I just wanna be left the shit alone, myself)‚Ä¶ But without us, many of your communities would succumb to the brown/blue waves MUCH faster. Plus, we know what that looks like, and will assist you in what we all know is coming. I‚Äôm your cannon fodder, your communities newest and best ‚Äúwhite blood cells‚Äù.Sure, hate the progressives that mistakenly try to plant roots in your communities. I hate them more. But if you hate Right-wing Californians more than you hate juan, tyrone, and the asian leftist ‚Äúlocals‚Äù of your community- you are retarded, and your community is already lost.Don‚Äôt hate us. We are allies, like it or not. And we are deep. So, you‚Äôre welcome for the assistance, turning your red states even redder. Some appreciation would be cool, mere tolerance appreciated by us, and the Californian hatred can just fuck itself. You don‚Äôt diss, or mistreat third-world commies in public. So why am I- as your natural ally- so despised, more than any other? It makes no sense. I don‚Äôt want to change your communities one tiny bit. I just want to keep my head down, and live a very quiet life like you have had the luxury to.It‚Äôs not our fault Cali went to shit. Would you despise South African Boers fleeing the monkey hordes? No. You‚Äôd be like BROOOOO you are cool, plz letz be frendz! I don‚Äôt want to be your friend, and I don‚Äôt care that your supermodel-tier women literally stalk me. I just want to be left completely the hell alone, to live a quiet life, while making fun of/mercilessly ridiculing your NPC neighbors, who are now my bullshit neighbors. I‚Äôm trying to get them to move to frisco or portland. Maybe humboldt.Back me up. Or, at least don‚Äôt slap me up. We are your communities new white blood cells. It would be stupid for a body to attack itself, you know? I‚Äôm here, you‚Äôre welcome. We don‚Äôt have to be friends, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make us enemies.

                Well, that‚Äôs one point of view‚Äîbut not one shared by all.  The assumption you‚Äôre making is that the CA refugees you speak of are valiant fighters who, in the end, through no fault of their own, lost their fight against Leftism and now need a place to regroup and begin again.The other thought is that these CA refugees caused their own unhappiness through their history of political choices and when the chickens came home to roost, fled‚Äîand further, they will again make the same political mistakes in their new residence.The second thought above is the one most commonly bemoaned by our local citizenry *and* political leaders.  I tend to be sympathetic to it myself as I don‚Äôt see much of a strengthening of conservative thought with the influx of former CA residents.  Could be their numbers are swamped by minority growth, I can‚Äôt say.

But we‚Äôre all part of the same country, been part of the same country, at the mercy of federal border policies, which is the reason most to blame as to why californians are flooding your states.You‚Äôd do well to remember that California WAS America, and not within the span of a single generation went from a 90% white utopia to the horror show it is today. I repeat : WITHIN A SINGLE GENERATION.If you think that can‚Äôt happen to you- or that it won‚Äôt happen to you- I know of a fantastic bridge with toll rights for sale.The fact is Californians are more of an asset than a  problem.I myself am a broke-ass, landless farmer, millenial. Not exactly the type to drive up real estate prices. To get to the point‚Ä¶ what happens in the quiet of your neighbor‚Äôs house does indeed effect you.If californians ARE SUCH A PWOOOBBLEM then you guys shouldve seceded beforehand, or helped the rest of your countrymen to secure the border. INSTEAD,  you did exactly as the dipshitlibs of California did, and pretended like immigration would never come to bother you, even via its ripple effects‚Ä¶You‚Äôve been barking up the wrong fuckin tree.

                        CA has been a weirdo State for longer than one generation.  In support of this assertion, I simply point to the effect‚Äîoutside of CA‚Äîof their regulations.  Example, years ago, more than one generation (25 years) to be sure, auto manufacturers were making all US cars to meet CA standards‚Äîthe toughest in the land.  Ditto on food products.  Simply read the labels on products you buy in the stores. And don‚Äôt forget your institutions of *lower* learning where you were doing your siting and protests long before the cancer spread to other States.No, you can‚Äôt lay *your* guilt on us, nor avoid your share of blame for your shithole of a State.  That we might follow in your footsteps does not negate that you led the way and now seek a place to hide‚Äîyou are not allies, but refugees‚Äîat best a ‚Äúgood example of a bad example‚Äù.That said, I wish all refugees a safe haven.  I am not vindictive, it serves no purpose.  However, that I have an innate distrust of new, former CA‚Äôs taking up residence here is understandable.  Indeed, this State has several now running for political office.  They won‚Äôt get my vote.

                We had a bunch of conservatives from Philly/NJ move to my neck of the woods in the 80s and 90s. Things got fancier, COL went up, some farms disappeared. Guess who followed those people in the last 20 years, and guess who‚Äôs moving out.
I hope that wave breaks and recedes but I‚Äôve yet to see evidence. In the meantime I expect to have a mess to clean up in my dotage.

                A big part of the Cali hate is not your politics ‚Äî you can wear your MAGA hat without fear. It‚Äôs your f**kin‚Äô home equity. You drive up the local real estate and price out the locals‚Äô kids. You cry about your lost utopia all the way to the bank. Maybe you didn‚Äôt intend to disrupt the good thing the locals had going, but you did. And calling your buddies back home and telling them you‚Äôve found an oasis where they need to follow along just drives more of the original folk out into the desert. So, it ain‚Äôt personal; it‚Äôs just self-preservation.

                Agree. I live in a big city in Canada probably similar to SF (without the ‚Äúgroid crime, although that is rising too). It‚Äôs all Asians, East and South. And Arabs, and Africans, and Latinos.The city seems cleared out of White people since the pandemic. The only White people left are insane, ugly, skinny, dysgenic mask wearing weirdos. There are also some young White people from other cities looking to live the ‚Äúcity life‚Äù for a bit. And a few rich White enclaves.I think the politics of California changed because demographics changed. That‚Äôs the case everywhere. There just aren‚Äôt as many White people anymore in relation to the overall population. 2 million Californians might move in, 60% R 40% D, but also 5 million aliens move in, 99% D. The area tilts D but Californians are blamed.Blaming White people is just another cope by conservatives who can‚Äôt face reality. It‚Äôs not white people doing anything, it‚Äôs open borders and mass immigration.

                Idk if you‚Äôre actually Pakistani, but the ‚ÄúSouth Asian‚Äù community is fuming at this point. They know better than whites do, the unlimited stream of immigration has dumped millions of low class third worlders right in their backyard. None of them can afford families due to rocking house prices. They have turned hard against mass immigration which is surprising.
They all voted for Trudeau in 2015 because the Conservatives be rayciss but ended up screwing themselves over. ‚ÄúBrown flight‚Äù of 90s generation immigrants is currently happening in ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù areas.

        Music wise a lot of people are mistaking ‚ÄúI hear garbage on the radio‚Äù with ‚Äúall music today is garbage‚Äù.  There‚Äôs a tremendous amount of great music being made, it just doesnt get distribution through the corporate (((music industry))) and takes little more searching out.  If you‚Äôre a music casual you might not know about it, but then again if you‚Äôre a casual you probably don‚Äôt care that much anyway because music isn‚Äôt really something you care that much about.Small related white pill‚Äù The world that produced someone like Loretta Lynn is gone and the audience she appealed to is also gone.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs not quite right.  Jack White (of White Stripes fame) who is kind of an interesting guy in his own right was a big fan of Loretta Lynn and actually produced and even did a track on her last big album ‚ÄúVan Lear Rose‚Äù.  The album did really well, maybe partly on the same trend that saw Johnny Cash get rediscovered by a new audience and have a lot of late life success. Also welcome counter evidence, by the way.Point is, good art and good culture is GOOD first and foremost.  There will always be an audience for it amongst people with taste, and try as tiktok might, there will always be at least a notable minority of these people.Most young people are garbage now, but not all are, and the better ones are mining our shared past for better alternatives to (((today‚Äôs corporate garbage))).  Young musicians and music lovers exist just like young artists and writers exist, but they‚Äôre dissidents like the rest of us and mainly lack platforms.Dont let the (((corporations))) convince you that everything is slop just because slop is all they put in your trough.  Also don‚Äôt become convinced that *everyone* loves the slop as much as the machine insists they do.  This is just more gaslighting.

            True. There are exceptions. But the number of exceptions is painfully small. Prior to the mid-90s, the majority of pop music one heard on the radio was at least decent, and much of it was quite good. One needn‚Äôt search through haystacks to find the rare golden needle. In other words, pop music has declined with alarming rapidity over the last three decades, and the vast majority of young people wouldn‚Äôt recognize a good album if it alighted on their bedreaded heads.Personally, I simply tuned out of the culture in 1992 and haven‚Äôt looked back. I listen exclusively to art music, don‚Äôt watch movies (James Bond excepted), and the only TV I watch is DVDs of old shows‚Äìcurrently watching the original Twilight Zone episodes. Maybe I‚Äôm missing some good stuff, but I doubt even today‚Äôs good stuff compares with the good stuff from the past.

                Rick Beato, the popular youtube music guy, talks about the decline in modern music that‚Äôs played on the radio often.  Multiple producers on single albums, the same four chords used, playing it safe with the same old formula, etc.
I try to keep up with current music and there are some gems, even though it takes effort.  I hate the idea of being a cranky oldster who only listens to the music of my youth, but there was so much great stuff years ago, there‚Äôs no comparison with today.  It seems like around 1995 is when things changed drastically.

                    My two cents: Beato is right. When I taught myself guitar, I did so by learning chord progressions to various songs, and it is definitely the case that older songs were more complex (both in having more chords, and more movements), and in a wide variety of keys (a lot of modern songs are in C, G, A and D, rarely in minor keys or flat keys). Modern songs don‚Äôt use dissonance as much either, both in terms frequency and variety. Lyrics have become simpler too.

                We‚Äôre just growing older.  I watch a lot of the old stuff (as compared to new) as well.  And I never cease to be amazed as to ‚Äúhow could I have watched that crap‚Äù.  Watching some of the old stuff gives one a sense of nostalgia and perspective, but as entertainment, in the main it was, as is, terrible‚Äîpoor writing, acting, hackneyed, and what have you.  Not much different today, albeit perhaps somewhat worse in that every plot line‚Äînew back in the day‚Äîhas been beaten to death over time.Twilight zone was pretty good for it‚Äôs time, but it‚Äôs really hard to separate the show from its writer and producer, Rod Serling, who did some of his best work outside of Twilight Zone.  What I have found interesting are some of the modern stuff coming from overseas.  Originality is hard to find in the US.

                One often overlooked reason why (in my opinion) much in media changed ‚Äî not necessarily for the better ‚Äî in the 1980s onward was, perversely, Reagan and the Republican move to deregulate radio, TV and (I think) other media markets. Applicable to radio: prior to the 1980s there were anti-monopoly regulations in place. The intent and the result of this was that there were more local, independent stations, often with interesting programming serving local markets. Come deregulation, there was much consolidation. As a result, today you can drive 1000 miles and you‚Äôd be unable to distinguish their ‚Äúsmooth jazz‚Äù station from the one in your home city, at least until you heard the call sign or local advertising. The situation is much the same for TV. Much the same happened in print media and (later) the quasi-monopolies of the internet. The past few years have shown how pervasive is the censorship, even aided and abetted by government at times.If anything good can be said, it‚Äôs that yes alternative media is available but finding it isn‚Äôt easy. The major media, however, have consolidated into relatively few hands with the predictable homogenization and hive-mind consequences.

My own musicality, being an oboist, English hornist, and in recent times, a player of the oboe d‚Äôamore, has been classical. Bach, Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schuman, Brahms, Ravel, Vaughn Williams, Britten, Copland, Tschaikovsky, Prokofiev, Mussorgsky, Shostakovich in orchestral forms. Danzi, Taffanel, Roussel, Milhaud, Poulenc, Fran√ßaix, Hindemith, Nielsen in chamber forms. Etc.
But always alive to vernacular forms, as well as Western early music, and non-Western, too.
Thanks.

                Wrote a big giant reply with tons of youtube links to songs, many different artists‚Ä¶ and got booted by the spam filter.Just to prove my point though I might point you towards youtube and 1) Polyphia and 2) Billy StringsBoth are young kids, virtuoso musicians recording musically sophisticated stuff (in extremely different styles, so check both).  Both are currently releasing new music and have solid (if niche) followings including among zoomers.  Both have obvious affection and inspiration for older artists and forms of (white) music but also take those influences in very new and fresh directions.Not saying theyre the end all by any means, tastes vary so maybe you hate both.  But its just an example that there‚Äôs a LOT of good stuff out there in very different styles.  The radio is not the real music scene today anymore than real crime today is white robbers breaking into the homes of intact suburban black families like they always do on ADT ads.

            Most people don‚Äôt really listen to music, they tend to focus on the vocal of the singer, take Jack White for example, excellent guitarist, good song writer, decent singer, but listen to his best albums WTF Meg White can‚Äôt play the drums, point this out to any White Stripes fan and they deny it, but it clear as day the woman just cant play the drums, she‚Äôs holding him backSometimes if I‚Äôm listening to the Pogues or a similar band, I‚Äôll ask someone how many instruments can they hear behind the singers voice, most people can only hear half of what going on

                Meg White is a horrible drummer and they both knew that‚Ä¶ and intentionally went with it to create the crazed exploding garage sound of their (especially early) albums.He‚Äôs worked with a lot of really excellent other musicians since then and created really different sounding music in other bands‚Ä¶ but white stripes is electric blues on a crazy old garbage guitar through a half functioning pawn shop amp OVER what sounds like an enthusiastic 8 year old playing george of the jungle drums on trash can lids.  That‚Äôs the sound and its like nothing else.You‚Äôre right though that musical normies barely notice instrumentation of any kind, except perhaps subconciously.

                It‚Äôs satisfying to hear someone else say the unsayeable about Meg White‚Äôs drumming.  She can‚Äôt play at all but you can‚Äôt say that because any criticism of any woman, except traditionalist women, is hate.

        The Better Man Conference sounds like a carbon copy of another organization called the ‚ÄúGood Men Project‚Äù, to the extent I originally thought it was the same people involved.   Everything about the message they are sending is exactly the same, and they both have the exact same target.https://goodmenproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Good-Men-Project-DI-Overview.pdfIt would be interesting to see the donors of these projects, as it‚Äôs clear they have a boatload of money to spread the message with very few normal people actually paying to read them.  One has to think the strategy is to saturate media with all these nonsense organizations to create the illusion of consensus and to drown out more grassroots male movements that might actually make lives better.

                    The dissident right moves further rightward and guys like BAP are astroturfed in order to be gatekeepers. Eventually the flood of people on the rightward shift are too much to hold back and the gates are knocked down. Guys like BAP are no longer valuable and the powers that be find other gatekeepers.
Long story short, BAP was no longer valuable to his promoters and that was that.

                The TRS guys speculated that BAP was funded by libertarian homosexual Peter Thiel to make the dissident right homo-friendly.  They based this speculation on the fact that Michael Anton reviewed BAP‚Äôs book and in the review acknowledged that Thiel had commissioned the review.
Just like tribe members try to infiltrate the dissident right to steer it away from antisemitism, it also may be true that homos follow a similar strategy.

        This all got me thinking about the material conditions we live in. I helped my grandfather clean out his basement once and was amazed at the things he had saved, that HIS father had saved, who had lived through the Great Depression. Bits of string, pipe, old knives, old cigar boxes full of miscellaneous screws or bolts which still had my great grandfather‚Äôs writing still on them. Today I go to our local rural transfer station (dump) and the place is full of furniture, and bicycles, chainsaws that still function, TVs, refrigerators.I think we‚Äôve forgotten where we came from and how this prosperity may not last forever. The vise as well as other tools my great grandfather used through the Great Depression I still use now.

            I know what you mean. I was raised on a farm. My dad grew up during the depression. I was 16 years old before I knew there was such a thing as new nails‚Äìbelieved they stopped making those things about 1931. The only nails I had seen up to that point were corkscrewed, rusty ones kept in a bushel basket in the tool shed.

                My mother‚Äôs side of the family hails from Iowa. She and two other siblings grew up on a farm there (1920-30s). I‚Äôve visited several times in my life, but hardly know that side of the family, never having lived closer than about 1,000 miles away. During my last visit there, ~1988, it‚Äôs worth noting that while ‚Äúthe family‚Äô still lived on the farm, the farm was in the agriculture program and few/no crops were grown there. In the ten or so years earlier, that had not been the case, but in 1988 there were no longer any live stock there either. I‚Äôll probably never visit there again: the closest kin I would have would be 2nd or more distant cousins, again people who I‚Äôve probably seen half a dozen times in my life, even if that. I have nothing against them, but they might as well be strangers. They probably can‚Äôt even be called real farmers any more.

            Hear, hear! When I moved to my current home, I began setting up a shop in the basement and I was in need of a few things. I check online and as luck would have it, there was a machine shop that had just gone out of business and the owners kids were selling a lot of his gear. Two items for sale were these forged vises that were built in Brooklyn around 1900, weighed around fifty pounds apiece and they wanted $300 for both of them. Done! I‚Äôve used these things to hold a door while painting, a bike frame also while painting and dozens of other things and they‚Äôve never disappointed me. They also have the built-in semi-circles under the main jaws that will hold pipes steady for cutting as well.I asked them why they were parting with them and was told that their mother was suffering from cancer and they needed every last dime to pay for her treatments. Sad, very sad, but unfortunately it happens. Old shit is built to last and I will willingly shell out more in payment if it means getting my hands on something that I can hand down to my children!

                I think the idea is that the Flynn Effect reversed at some point during the late 20th Century. What I‚Äôm wondering is if losing 1 IQ point on average per decade would even have a noticeable effect in the short term. It seems like we‚Äôve lost 15 to 20 average IQ points in the last five or so years alone. Obviously, no such dramatic decline in intelligence could occur so rapidly. My own suspicion is that technology not only makes us dumber ‚Äî by enabling us to be more intellectually lazy ‚Äî it also makes us seem dumber than we actually are. Twitter alone gives off the impression that ours is a culture of blithering imbeciles.

                    You are forgetting the theory of the ‚ÄúSmart Fraction‚Äù.  The concept that there is a percentage of the population‚Äîhigher IQ types‚Äî necessary for good things to happen, like keeping the lights on.  That percentage may not have been reached yet despite the average lowering of the population IQ.
Eventually however, that percentage will be reached and the decline begins.  One might argue (I have) that the percentage has been reached and we are experiencing such signs.  Dutton has in any number of his videos.

                        It seems like dissidents who are especially data-driven showed a depressing tendency to fall hook, line, and sinker for the Covid bullshit. Steve Sailer and Ed Dutton would be two of the most prominent (and therefore saddest) examples. My suspicion is that Covid had huge appeal for those who love data. Since establishment media mouthpieces were constantly throwing out numbers about the apocalyptic event they claimed was happening, data fanatics couldn‚Äôt get enough of the insanity. Those fanatics allowed their love of numbers, even numbers that no sensible person would have relied on, to completely overwhelm any skepticism that they might have harbored toward the entire fraudulent affair. It‚Äôs a good lesson to the rest of us that we should never let a particular hobby horse/obsession prevent us from seeing the bigger picture.

                Why should Dutton have paid the least attention to your favorite hobby bourse, Covid?
Did Dutton even speak on Covid, or mention the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for any of the political/medical interventions undertaken?  I‚Äôve not seen such in my following of him during the scamdemic.  It is possible he had not the slightest interest‚Äîand for that I‚Äôm grateful.  There were any number of others with excellent backgrounds and knowledge to keep us informed.

                    You got it backwards buddy. Covid wasn‚Äôt my hobby horse it was HIS.
Dutton mocked those who refused to get ‚Äúvaccinated.‚Äù
You can take my internet word for it or do your own research: that was his take on it.

                    Did you take the experimental gene therapy injection, Compsci?I can‚Äôt imagine having being that gullible and naive, can you?Dutton otoh, was. That‚Äôs why he should never be cited as an authority, on anything, ever again. His instincts are fail. He is like Sailer and Cochrane ‚Äî smart guys but something missing, like intuition or an instinct, or good sense, or whatever u wanna call it.Letting any of those guys have a pass for their failure, on the most crucial litmus test, of the modern world?Not a chance in hell. If that doesn‚Äôt clue you in, to their overall quality, as thought leaders, than nothing will.So I repeat my question: did you get the experimental gene therapy, or are you worried about it, and biased, perhaps over the fate of loved ones? Everyone is more or less in that boat, but that‚Äôs no reason to pretend it wasn‚Äôt a huge huge huge fail, on everyone‚Äôs part. How many kids‚Äô lives, have been wrecked, by the clot shots, and you wanna pass it off as a ‚Äúhobby horse.‚ÄùDude ‚Äî get ur head outta the sand.

                        Total nonsense.  You obviously are new here.  Before you spout off, perhaps you should follow the comments and commenters a bit more.  You‚Äôd make less of a fool of yourself.I‚Äôve never had the vexxine, nor promoted such.  I have always denounced the false modeling in support of the Covid scamdemic and discussed at length my interactions with doctors and local health personnel wrt Covid and Covid restrictions in my area.I have had Covid twice and related at length the effect of such.  I am also in the high risk category of age, so there is skin in the game.If I‚Äôve missed something wrt Dutton, then point me to one of his video‚Äôs wrt his position on Covid.  I‚Äôve read most of his works as well‚Äîhave you?  I maintain he‚Äôs never had a position on Covid.It is ridiculous to attempt to cast Dutton into the void for not living up to whatever position you think he should hold wrt to a position that he has not‚Äîor rarely‚Äîspoken about.Dutton holds any number of views supporting HBD as per common discussions on the DR.  This is why I stated Covid is your ‚Äúhobby horse‚Äù‚Äîthere is more to the DR than a single cause, like the recent Covid scamdemic.Keep this up and you‚Äôll soon be able to talk only to your mirror.  Learn to differentiate friend from enemy.  You friend is not always one who agrees with you 100%.

        Regarding women in the workforce, a few observations.1.  The competent, very attractive women who have to deal with aspie level guys like engineers learn to wear loose clothing to keep men‚Äôs eyes on the right place.  The ones with a reasonable personality understand that‚Äôs a minor price to pay for all the advantages Nature has given them.2.  Incompetent women from the range of 4-10 on the looks scale learn how easily they can get thirsty men to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them with an issue, which usually involves the men doing essentially all of her assigned work.3. Unattractive, incompetent women still get the sympathy factor where a few good tears with a good story makes them much harder to fire.The fact is, life is not fair, which is why attractive men and women move up the chain even is they are a little less competent than their unattractive peers.

        My spouse would get a kick out of the boob thing.  When she was younger, worked for two firms that basically had a lot of short Jewish guys.  She‚Äôs 5‚Äô11‚Äù, Nordic looking blonde and let‚Äôs say ‚Äúblessed‚Äù.  Problem was in heels is well over 6‚Äô, so any time she was talking to any of these guys they were basically looking at her chest.  She always got a chuckle out of the stammering and sweating and the fact many had to crane their necks up to look at her.  Plus was fresh off the national rowing team and had bigger biceps then most of them.  Used it as an intimidation tool.

            You just caused a flashback to uni many eons ago. Going back to the cafeteria serving line to get something and seeing this girl from our residence who was the same type as your wife and yes a total knockout standing there with her tray and nearby a poor little j-guy seemingly catching sight of her for the first time: he was absolutely gobsmacked/mesmerized/deer in the headlights. It was more than a little pathetic. And a little creepy. I think that‚Äôs why the memory stuck.

        I haven‚Äôt listened to the podcast yet ‚Äî just wanted to say that the written piece that goes along with it is fantastic. I was listening to some Patsy Cline several days ago and it struck me that such music came out of an entirely different world than what we‚Äôre living in today. Most of the songs Cline performed (I don‚Äôt believe she wrote many of them herself) dealt with simple heartbreak, yet they come off as genuine, wholesome, and maybe even a tad naive. Today‚Äôs culture is so much more cynical and debased than the one that spotlighted musicians such as Cline. We‚Äôve lost something . . .  and very few seem to realize that we‚Äôve lost something. And how could young people figure that out if they themselves have never experienced what we‚Äôve lost? My desire to connect with a past that predates my own existence only by a decade or two increases the more I watch everything deteriorate.

            Modern culture can‚Äôt even do cynicism well.  I grew up in the heyday of grunge, which, whether you like it or not, really spoke to the nihilism and frustrations of youth, while creating a very unique sound that made these bands instantly recognizable.  The music done by corporate boards can‚Äôt be cynical in the music, as they don‚Äôt really feel the alienation.  They can only be cynical in their marketing of the slop they dish out.You can see the creation and dissolution of countless music styles from as long ago as the classical era to about 10-20 years ago, then popular music suddenly became homogenized within only a few distinct genres and no new creativity seems to be capable of breaking out of the mold in the mainstream.

While I‚Äôm more of a classic rock guy, I would much rather listen to grunge than the mindless twaddle produced today. Grunge at least sounds authentic; everything today comes off as a pose concocted by some soulless marketing department.

                    This jumped out at me recently as I was bombarded with MTV Video Music Awards advertisements while watching something on Comedy Central (either an old movie or old South Park reruns).I noticed all the acts promoted in the commercials were solo acts, typically various shades of brown.  Obviously cranked through some corporate management machine.I recalled that in my youth, there were typically actual bands of white dudes headlining the MTV VMAs.  Guns &amp; Roses, Van Halen, Bon Jovi, Nirvana, etc.I struggle to believe that there aren‚Äôt groups of white dudes somewhere in the US playing guitars somewhere.  But the (((corporate talent people))) can‚Äôt find them anywhere?Yet another vector in the great replacement and cultural genocide.

                    Yes, already mentioned were the White Stripes. Amateur drummer, garage band sound, but that was part of the image. Even I recall a few of their songs (I heard them in my 40s). Of course a lot of it is in the production: I‚Äôm enjoying the recommended ‚ÄúKing Gizzard of the Lizard Wizard‚Äù which I assume is a modern band, yet their sound is pure 60s psychedelic.

Have you listened to any of the recent neo/echo-grunge groups?
Some of them are quite good, but their subject matter is light, almost trite compared to the original groups.
I also agree about the death of distinct musical genres. That was one of the best things in  80s and 90s music. It seemed to get snuffed out around the early to mid 00s.

            Wkathman: ‚ÄúI was listening to some Patsy Cline several days ago and it struck me that such music came out of an entirely different world than what we‚Äôre living in today.‚ÄùWilly Nelson [born in 1938] is one of only a handful of fellows still living who witnessed [the very last days of] the Golden Age of Country.In 1961, at the ripe old age of 23, he wrote ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù for Patsy Cline.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Bs8kSz4pYListening to it all these many years later ‚Äì and my goodness was Patsy Cline a once in a century talent ‚Äì I‚Äôm kinda shocked that a 23 year old boy could have written such tragic [and frankly almost cynical] lyrics.I wonder if Whit Stillman could do an historical movie along the lines of ‚ÄúThe Last Days of Country‚Äù?Listening to the artistry of the early Elvis Trio [Elvis &amp; Scotty Moore &amp; Bill Black], you‚Äôll hear a subtlety &amp; resonance of guitar picking like nothing anyone has produced in decades, and Elvis had phenomenally good diction as a singer.Here they are for the 1954 Louisiana Hay Ride:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLaPnpjw-pcI don‚Äôt know whether we even have the proper microphones and sound stages anymore to reproduce such a delicately perfectionist approach to musical performance.The second half of that video had Elvis‚Äôs rendition of ‚ÄúBlue Moon of Kentucky‚Äù; here‚Äôs Patsy Cline‚Äôs version:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk4UrBymboAPS: I defy anyone on this board to sing ‚ÄúBlue Moon‚Äù at the tempo that the 19-year-old Elvis sang it for the 1954 Louisiana Hayride; we would completely garble the song.Elvis was incredibly talented.And we 21st Century cretins can barely even mumble our way through conversations these days.Off the top of my head, I can‚Äôt think of any performer or person of public notoriety with that perfection of diction in their speech, much less their singing at allegro/presto tempos.

        A lot of people who are mourning Loretta Lynn are doing so for the same reasons that so many people mourned Queen Elizabeth II, as different as they were ‚Äì they are not so much mourning the people themselves as they are mourning the passing of the world that produced them. It‚Äôs not possible to lament the passing of that world  as a world, because that would be allegedly racist, sexist, transphobic, pedophobic, and Lord knows what else, so people mourn the loss of the people that world produced. It‚Äôs at least partially a displacement activity. Camille Paglia said a few years ago that our society is becoming obsessed by grief and loss, and this might be one of the reasons why.FWIW, I‚Äôm the same way. I did not particularly care for Lynn‚Äôs music, and Elizabeth was actually a pretty mediocre monarch, but I hated to see both of them go. Yet another part of the old world gone. But as Benet said in ‚ÄúBy The Waters of Babylon‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe must build again!‚Äù

            No heat or indoor plumbing, living in an unfinished house my dad built every day after work, wearing hand-me-downs from my cousin. But space: big garden, orchard, chickens, geese, turkeys. Also a rusty BMX bike; a BB gun; friends; plenty of woods, meadows, and corn fields to explore; forts to build and guard from rivals.
Screw that‚Äî growing up ‚Äòpoor‚Äô kicked ass. Wouldn‚Äôt have traded places with the suburbanites for the world, because as far as I was concerned, I already had it.

            Does growing up house-poor count? We couldn‚Äôt even afford HBO like our bougie friends could, and certainly could not afford a country club membership. Our most expensive vehicle was a new Chevy Astro van with pilot seats in the back. The only box seats I ever sat in were gifted from my dad‚Äôs work. Going to a non-chain Italian restaurant was the closest thing we had to a gourmet meal.My parents tried hard to live upper-middle class, and eventually failed. That is a unique kind of poor: you look reasonably comfortable and well-off, but still living paycheck to paycheck, and a layoff, a divorce, or a bad stock market deal could send us down multiple economic brackets. At least when you‚Äôre poor, you stay poor and the only way is up.

                Marko:  Sounds a bit like our circumstances when all our income (and most of our debt) went to paying Christian school tuition.  Our children never lacked for love, food, or clothing, but they were never the first to have the ‚Äòlatest‚Äô anything.  They might get it eventually, by which time their classmates had moved on to something else.  We had no money for vacations, while their friends traveled around the US or Europe.
My husband always said we weren‚Äôt poor; we were broke.  There‚Äôs a distinct difference.

                    Precisely.  Looking back at childhood I can now see that my mother and I were ‚Äúpoor‚Äù, but at the time I had *no idea*.  What did I need, that I lacked?  Well, nothing.  Food, shelter, clothes and an occasional dollar and I was on my own to do as I liked.  I played with friends and went to school.

                    When you are poor, but pretending you are rich, I can see the problem you describe.  I admit, it‚Äôs a societal situation I missed in my youth, but seems de rigeuer today.

        Odd to read this, because I was thinking this morning about both Loretta Lynn and the disappearance and possible reappearance of widespread poverty in our lifetimes. I did not tie the two together at all, though, and it did not occur to me. Thanks for doing so.Compare and contrast the people who lived in Lynn‚Äôs hometown of Butcher‚Äôs Hollow, West Virginia, in her lifetime with those who live there today, and it is readily apparent the latter live grimmer, emptier lives even though the prospect of hunger and homelessness is not ever-looming. Moonshine vs. opioids, traditional folk music vs. Africanized rap, pregnant teens forced to marry early vs. hos dropping little bastards and paid each month as a direct result. Lynn was dinged by wealth and abundance later in life but recovered. How will those who tweak all day listening to rap fare when food and shelter no longer magically appear? The question answers itself.The loss of Queen Elizabeth at the extreme end of one spectrum and Lynn at the other mark our passage into a long night of illusion, fraud, and learned helplessness.

            Loretta Lynn was from Kentucky, but one side of the Tug Fork looks a lot like the other, and is pretty much how you describe it.  A lot of poor white people driving ATVs to their court appearances.

        ‚ÄúPerhaps in time it will mature into a genuine alternative to the lunacy of feminism.‚ÄùWhen it was pushed and peddled in the early ‚Äô70s by the media establishment, there was an underlying economic logic to it: it brought millions of relatively low-paid female workers into the workforce and feminized that workforce. That is to say, it helped to create a lower-paid and more docile workforce.‚ÄúFifty years ago, everyone knew someone who came from such conditions because we still had lots of genuine poor people.‚ÄùI recall that in the late ‚Äô70s I would still occasionally run across people who had lived during the Great Depression and had even ridden on freight trains at that time looking for work. That experience shaped a generation that died out decades ago.

The depression is still real for a lot of people out there.

        To further your point, I was listening to an interview with this guy from the music industry. He was talking about how they use advanced analytics in music now, just like they do in sports. For example, in baseball, managers no longer make in game decisions, an Ivy League mathematician in the front office creates spread sheets on how to handle every situation. The manager then just looks at the spread sheet and picks the provided answer.Well in music, it‚Äôs similar. This man was saying that through the data collected on these streaming services like Spotify or apple music, the music industry knows exactly which beats and rhythms correspond to more repeat listening. Thus, in 1970, songs could have any number of unorthodox formats, while today there‚Äôs less than a dozen or so formats.

                You must think this is a modern phenomenon. Apparently you didn‚Äôt listen to pop in the 70s/early 80s and/or ever attend a Boston concert üòÄPerhaps that‚Äôs an unfair example, since it‚Äôs a single pop group. But it‚Äôs a fact that most groups have a signature sound. Sometimes so much so that a fan can identify a new song from its first few seconds, as was my experience with (say) Van Halen. I consider it a mark of artistry that a group could be very versatile. For example, the varied output of Queen or even the Beatles, among many others. Some artists even deliberately tried their hand at diverse genres of music, Elvis Costello perhaps for one.

                Its also the seeds of its own destruction in some ways (at least as a creative function if not commercially speaking).
One can only model previous data, which parts of are selected for and amplified, and the same analysis applied ad infinitum.
In the end you will selectively generate only a single type of output with 100% listening as no other variation will exist.

                    There is a large Puerto Rican demographic where I live and in the summer months one is inescapably exposed to their music.  They have already reached this point.  Every single song sounds identical.  They all use exactly the same beat, completely eschew melody, and use heavily processed vocals delivered in a staccato rap.  It really is astounding how similar they are.

But seriously, it‚Äôs criminal how upstate has been used as a dumping ground for PR‚Äôs.  We had a few in town when I was growing up in the 80‚Äôs, but now they‚Äôre a majority.  I noticed a huge increase in their numbers after hurricane Maria.

For over a decade we had a Cuban in HR that made it her life‚Äôs mission to pipeline Boricuas from the university in PR to our firm.
My favorite is the guy who, during his interview out of college, admitted to my black co-worker, ‚ÄúYeah, I cheated on my exams.‚Äù My co-worker stated this to a dozen people at the internal group follow-up.
Of course they hired the guy. Then they mentored him. Now, we have engineering managers that are totally incapable of composing a two-sentence email using proper English.

He‚Äôd graduated from Arizona or Arizona State on a track scholarship, but had obviously not bothered with his courses.  The guy‚Äôs emails were appalling.  I compiled a Word document with his most unintelligible excerpts.  In meetings he would sit on his phone and text relatives in Jamaica about a flop house they were building on the island, paying no attention to the goings on around him.
So of course he was promoted up and last I heard was in a managerial position at another facility.

        It‚Äôs an amazing qualitative difference, enough to make generations mutually unintelligible. I wasn‚Äôt poor as a kid (early 1970s), but you could see poor from my trailer (yes, really) with a pair of binoculars. I sometimes think about that, and how different my perceptions are because of it. You get a much different perspective on life just by wearing hand-me-down clothes. I spent most of elementary school dressed like a surfer, for instance, even though we lived a thousand miles from the nearest ocean, because my aunt in California mailed my mom a box of hand-me-downs every six months. Nowadays, of course, those clothes would be ‚Äúvintage‚Äù and I‚Äôd be the most expensively-dressed kid in school‚Ä¶ just bizarre. I wonder if that, even more than ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù on the Pocket Moloch, is the real difference.

Off topic, but that magazine, published in 1970 straddles the fault line of the glorious industrial apex of western civilization, and downward slope that, in hindsight, we can clearly see .  After all, in the early seventies whodidn‚Äôtwant to get in on the next Hong Kong, i.e. Kenya:

                And that‚Äôs why a certain type and level of welfare has never bothered me all that much. In a vastly rich society like ours was, no kid should have to live like that. (The aforesaid type and level of welfare being along the lines of ‚Äústaple food and basic clothing, along with decent school facilities.‚Äù After that, you‚Äôre on your own. With strict caps and no cash for any reason, obviously, except if you agree to trade in the inflation-adjusted value of twenty years‚Äô worth of staple goods for the renunciation of your citizenship and a one-way ticket to Wakanda. At that point, we‚Äôll cut you the check and the ticket, and happy trails to you).

        There really isn‚Äôt any authenticity anymore ‚Äì everything is so freaking generic these days.  Music all sounds the same, regardless of the genre.  A few days ago we went to the see the Doobie Brothers.  I was never a big fan, but the wife and some friends wanted to go.  It actually wasn‚Äôt a bad show and those guys could play guitar a lot better than I remembered ‚Äì especially for 70+ year olds.

            If you cut out the lyrics, every genre of today‚Äôs music is nearly indistinguishable.  Modern country, Christian rock, conventional pop, they all sound the same with Africanized beats and overly-emotive vocalizing.  The only difference is the subject of the lyrics.  It reminds me of when Homer Simpson toured the Duff brewery and there was one giant pipe that branched into three smaller pipes that fed into vats labeled Duff, Duff Dry, and Duff Lite.

            There‚Äôs a reason. Lived experience is variegated and therefore music based on such experience ‚Äî and on the vagaries of personal style ‚Äî is similarly variegated. And it goes without saying that music based on such experience sounds authentic. The stuff today ‚Äî I can hardly call it music ‚Äî comes from on high (corporate boardrooms and data scientists trying to distill what will sell). It‚Äôs all synthetic, trite, and soul-deadening. It is anti-culture. The devil works through economic imperatives.Thinking about it more deeply, it strikes me that so much of life today in the West is so synthetic and trite that even music based on it may not be much better.

        It‚Äôs interesting to look at country in the 60s. I feel that before the British invasion, that there was a strong possibility that Nashville could be a mainstay on the pop charts. Patsy cline, Jim reeves, Marty Robbins etc were on the pop charts on a semi regular basis.
Cline and reeves died 17 months apart and when you combine that with the change in music tastes ‚Äì the Nashville sound was mostly over.

            It‚Äôs not the sound of modern country that bothers me so much as the lyrical content.  Drink beer, drive a pickup, high school football, pine for your small town, lather, rinse, repeat.  It‚Äôs likely that gangsta rap, despite its focus on drugs, sex, and violence, tackled a wider range of subjects.
It‚Äôs clearly intended to fixate normie on the most superficial aspects of his people and to never think about how to preserve the more profound bonds of culture and community.

                I really wanted to like modern country music.  There a few country stations on the radio where I live and I like the idea of me being a guy who listens to country music on the radio, as superficial as that sounds.  But I can‚Äôt stand it.KGB said that the sound of the music is tolerable but the lyrics are intolerable.I agree about the sound, although it is quite processed and there are some regrettable hip hop and arena rock influences.  But it‚Äôs still one of the only contemporary forms of music with actual melodies.I agree about the execrable lyrics too but KGB didn‚Äôt mention what I most can‚Äôt stand.  More than the other topics that KGB mentioned, the lyrics of country music songs are mostly simping to women.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only woman for me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything for you.‚ÄùNauseating.  You can tell that the song writers begin their writing by asking, ‚ÄúWhat lyrics would make women open their wallets?‚Äù

Mind you, I only hear country during the roughly 5 to 10 minutes a day I‚Äôm in the can at my job, and that may be affecting my opinions.

        ‚ÄúIn a world where the hardest choices are on the menu, people are not interested in the human condition.‚ÄùWell, we all still gotta die, and that‚Äôs a big one. At least, I‚Äôm pretty sure we all still have to die. SF writer Ben Bova had an interesting if slightly wonky bit in his nonfiction book ‚ÄúImmortality‚Äù about lengthening telomeres indefinitely to stay alive forever. That‚Äôs definitely one program where you don‚Äôt want to be an early adopter. Biden and Pelosi and especially Feinstein are walking horror shows, and they‚Äôre only in their 80s. I don‚Äôt want to be the first one-hundred and fifty year-old man. Then I suppose Bill Gates and some Chinese lunatics are looking in to uploading their consciousness onto some kind of vitrified substrate, and who knows what else. Cryogenics is still problematic because of cell death. Freezing‚Äôs easy. Thawing isn‚Äôt.Sucks about Loretta Lynn.
