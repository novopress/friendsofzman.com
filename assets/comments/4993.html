        Good news everyone, he is back!
“Radio Derb is back on the air!Yes, this is your irrepressibly genial host John Derbyshire with a weekly round-up of news and opinion from a dissident conservative viewpoint.”
I wold give him a shout-out, any excuse to post this picture of his assistants, Mandy, Brandy &amp; Candy wearing “talk derby to me” t-shirts!
The podcast/radio is free again and hosted on VDARE.
While I’m at it, i also recommendReasonable Doubt, the brand new podcast with Adam Carolla and his lawyer buddy Mark Garages.

            I see that. He must have updated it today as this morning it did not mention VDare. That’s good to hear. I thought he may be headed to Unz.

            The strange thing is Taki scrubbed their site of Derb Radio. Derb’s last transmission said nothing about a hiatus. He was also absent on Thursday so I’m guessing there was some sort of disagreement. If it was just a vacation thing or a health issue then there would be no need for the site scrubbing.

                …Derb’s not scrubbed from the Taki Mag contributors list however.I think Taki Mag overpriced the radio service.I think that making Radio Derb a paid service at $72/yrcut the listenership by a huge amount.I think if Taki would have charged a flat $10 or $12 bucksmany more people would have chipped in.Besides, I was never sure who the money went to – Derb or Taki.I have trouble sending money to people who own their own islands, live on yachts, and were born with the proverbial silver spoon stuck somewhere. (But that’s just me.)…

                    Yeah. That was in my head when I was struggling to sign up. I remembered that Taki blows more on socks than I’m worth and that ended my efforts.
I think that site is just a hobby to keep his daughter busy. I’ve always assumed she would get bored with it eventually and that would be the end of it.
