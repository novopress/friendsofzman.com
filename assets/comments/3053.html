        There is a difference between appearing rich and being wealthy. in “The Millionaire Next Door” by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko, the authors define wealthy as having a net worth substantially above their expected level of net worth based on age and income. So a family with a combined income of $55,000 a year and $460,000 in assets would be considered wealthy, but a doctor with $560,000 income and corresponding lifestyle would not.

        “It was a poppy seed bagel”, “I just came from the dentist”…or something.I’ve come to understand there’s a BITCHIN’ video game set up in the basement of the VP’s residence in DC. The landlord? *ahem* The USN.I guess SOMEBODY didn’t take the concept of OBSERVATORY too seriously.

        On the other hand, while it is understandable to despise the social media jump ups (like Zuckerberg, et al) we mustn’t lose sight of the rabid bunch of lefty non-achievers who want to take their money — however earned — and ‘redistribute’ it for the good all mankind.Rich may be obnoxious but wannabe rich with someone else’s money is even worse.As for for what Guinness said, I always recall one venerable actor who used to play in the dressing-up box who simply dismissed his acting in a war film as “pretending not to like other people.” This, I guess, is opposed to pretending to like each other.

        You’ve missed a whole sub-species of rich people of today. This group is especially obnoxious. The “famous for being famous” crowd. Snooki, Paris Hilton, Heidi Montag, Jordan, Kim Kardashian. They appeal to a generation of people who think the news is pictures of these cunts and Top 10 Lists about why your diet isn’t working. They don’t act, can’t sing, not very funny and not even model-attractive. Boys have no role-models anymore, girls worship/slag off sluts on TV.
Don’t get me started on chefs that have become rich and famous for cooking stuff. Chefs!

        Wasn’t it (Sir) Alec Guinness who said something about acting like, “Remember your lines and try not to trip over the furniture.”

        I don’t just hate rich pop stars. I hope Mark Zuckerburg goes for a dip at his new Hawaii retreat and drowns.

        Romney is the son of George Romney, a rich guy who was governor of Michigan and ran for President. Willard did not exactly pull himself up by his bootstraps.

        People are famous for being well-known, simple as that. They are also rich because someone else is making money along the way, and influential because the real decision-makers have already decided what’s best for them.
‘Twas always thus, and will probably always will be.

        We have become a nation of unserious people, allowing “elites” to control the levers of policy and power while many in the lower strata of society collect their hush money from Uncle Sugar in the form of EBT cards. Too many of the rest of us in the middle class concern ourselves with meaningless entertainments when we’re not busy earning a paycheck. We, in effect, pay these entertainers of average talent to make us forget that we are too weary, too distracted, too unserious, to try to change the status quo.

        Really broad generalizations here. Seems like you’re more resentful of rich people who made their filthy lucrethrough the idiocy of pop culture. I’m with you on that score.

        Naah, the people featured in these stories are celebrities.  There wealth comes at a price, the complete loss of privacy.  Plus if they get out of line, they can be deprived of their wealth or even imprisoned and they all know this.  The real powerful people in the world don’t have a newspaper such as the Telegraph publishing exactly where they live.Half Sigma/ LOTB, borrowing from Paul Fussell, is right with the concept of “top out of site rich”.  The way the elite in the West runs, they really really value misdirection, salesmanship, and outright lying.  If you control most of the wealth and want to lie low, you create a fake wealthy class of essentially actors that are allowed to live the lifestyle (without the privacy) as long as they behave the right way in public.  Many of these people are actual professional actors.  I don’t think its worth the loss of privacy myself, but maybe these people don’t have much of a choice.
