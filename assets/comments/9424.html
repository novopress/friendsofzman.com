        The DoJ is now in the hands of people who will be more likely to infiltrate these groups and make preemptive arrests and prosecute those who fund them, including parents of trust fund babies. Some of these creeps are actually funded by non-profits. Confiscating assets of backers is an idea whose time has come. Can you say RICO, Mr. Soros?I‚Äôd like the Congress, which has jurisdiction over DC, to pass a law making it illegal for anyone to have their face covered for non-medical reasons, and to be required to pull their medical mask off at the request of any citizen for a phone picture under penalty of immediate incarceration. The leftists are using terror tactics of the KKK. If clansmen aren‚Äôt allowed to go around harrassing people while wearing masks, the left should be denied this privilege as well.

            Civil charges are long overdue for the people funding these riots. I think a few lawsuits against the financial backers would put an end to this stuff.

                Melania may give us a clue to her husband‚Äôs plans on wielding the big stick that is D.C.: ‚ÄúPunch Back 10x Harder!‚Äù
‚ÄúMelania Trump makes a rare campaign speech in support of her husband, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in Wisconsin on Monday. Mrs Trump says while her husband is fair and treats everyone equally, he will ‚Äòpunch back ten times harder‚Äô if he is attacked.‚Äù‚Äì theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/05/melania-trump-donald-will-punch-back-ten-times-harder-video

                Agree. Just as the most effective method of controlling immigration would be to bang Sheldon Adelson up for 5 years for cleaning his casinos with illegals.

            Right on Doc!  Follow the money.  Soros, as a dual citizen of Hungary and the USA, should have his American citizenship revoked for the domestic enemy he is.  The MSM talks up the Russian hacking, of which there has been little evidence to corroborate although everyone is certain, but there is ample proof of Soros and his well funded organizations messing with American politics and elections and funding of subversive elements across the land, and around the world.  If there is one guy who should be taken to Guantanamo, it should be Georgie-boy.

            Here are two pieces on funding of these 5th column groups. The first an ex WSJ reporter digs into the the Soros rabbit hole and discovers 50 connections. The second is another take on monetary backing of the astro-turf, our tax money funneled to fund these actors.But the last link is something interesting indeed. MAGA is not only for making America Great Again, it is a beautiful hedge against the US Treasury bod market collapse. This is how Trump the business man is going to start making America again the valued economic force. By that I‚Äôm saying instead of the trillions in treasuries everyone holding being dumped pretty soon to rid themselves of their toxic value, Trumps gets America back to work, and against all odds, makes US Treasuries the most valuable solid investment possible. And I‚Äôm saying too, Trump will use gold in some way to back that full faith and credit in the dollar. It is the only way out of what the 12 banking family cartel has done with their private money laundering scheme aka The federal Reserve.The icing on the cake here is property in America, dirt people prosperity, is the most powerful weapon that you can wield against these scum out to destroy our great Republic.Withdrawing from the transnationalists and globalists agenda trade scams is a fantastic place to begin.Bull doze the UN into the East River too.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-22/ex-wsj-reporter-finds-soros-has-ties-more-50-partners-women‚Äôs-march-washingtonhttps://freenorthcarolina.blogspot.com/2017/01/did-they-use-any-of-your-tax-dollars.htmlhttp://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/US-announces-withdrawal-from-TPP

        The fix is easy, 1-2 years in prison for a convicted rioter and RICO suits against the funders. It‚Äôs a matter of will, which brings me back to why Trump won: because normal people finally saw someone who they believed had the will to stop all this insanity.

            Start with the underlings and make a few draconian examples to show we‚Äôre serious. Then look for a couple more who will turn evidence to save themselves. And then work the chain upward. Those street people who were doing it for pay are mercenaries. They should have no reason for loyalty and should fold quickly.

        I watched my local news last night. A couple minutes of perfunctory coverage of the inauguration, then endless coverage of the action: cars burning, trash cans through windows, brave protesters marching in the streets. Followed of course by a graphic of where to go to attend tomorrows protests in our area, like it was a civic event or something. I live in Idaho for God‚Äôs sake! Gird your loins people, the establishment is about to go all in on keeping the power, and a few cracked eggs will be a small price to pay in their view. It didn‚Äôt end with Trump, it‚Äôs just started.

            Of course it is a cheap price when it is paid by us and not them. IN so many cases, the snowflakes went into ‚Äújournalism‚Äù in order to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù, i.e. the same basic intent professed by the riot organizers.

                Rurik:  Agree entirely that the main stream or legacy media are the real enemies and that they should be treated accordingly.  They are no small part of this attempt to destroy traditional Western, Enlightenment societies.  And like the Masters they serve, they offer nothing to any ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù society in return.  Nothing.  The people who ‚Äúwork‚Äù for them are not only ‚Äúuseful idiots‚Äù they are clueless idiots.I never tune or click into MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC or NPR anymore and I only sparingly do so with FOX (although FOX appears to be ‚Äúturning the corner‚Äù, so to speak).  However, through some other you tube channels (I forget off the top of my head but maybe it was Info Wars, Alex Jones) I did watch Chris Matthews and Rackel Madcow flapping their lips from their pie holes after Trump‚Äôs Inaugural Address.  If what they were saying wasn‚Äôt so twisted and potentially harmful I‚Äôd have been LMAO just looking at how butt hurt they were.There is a very powerful paragraph from William Schirer‚Äôs ‚ÄúRise and Fall‚Äù that is applicable today to our legacy media here in the United States as well as many European countries.  If I get a shout to post it I will.

                    Hear hear!  Ditto on the nixing of the Lame Stream.  I recently started tuning back in to Fox since there is finally something good to hear about.  And there is.  But alas, they still have pukes like McCain, Rove, Graham and Rivera (Geraldo variety) on as regulars.  Why?  Still seems like Fox is a bit tone deaf for some things.

                        And President Trump also agrees with us. I noticed that from beginning to end of his campaign, his main target was the Establishment Media.His attacks on Hillary, Bernie, and his pseudo-Republican rivals, even Obama were always secondary to his attacks on their Media champions. It is much like the Nimitz/MacArthur strategy of seizing Pacific Islands primarily to draw out the Japanese fleet into battle where it could be annihilated by air and submarine. President Trump identified the main enemy and focused his fire on them. And from what I‚Äôve seem this weekend, that is still President Trump‚Äôs (I still like typing that!) main game plan.

                    Yes, I‚Äôm shouting for you to post that paragraph from Schirer‚Äôs ‚ÄúRise and Fall.‚Äù Thank you. And for the good post, too.Agree that media are the enemies. I consider them Public Enemy #1 in terms of being the most powerful and damaging tool of the ruling class. (Politicians are #2. Then Think Tanks, NGO‚Äôs and Schools.) Through the media, a giant PsyOp has been imposed on the American people, successfully. A good number of us see it, but many do not. We need to show them whenever possible. When I‚Äôm (rarely) asked, I try to but there‚Äôs a lot to it and it‚Äôs hard to explain it all to a brainwashed person without coming across as a paranoid conspiracy theorist. As John the River said, Interesting times!

                    Here is the quote from Schirer‚Äôs ‚ÄúRise and Fall‚Äù.  It helps if you know who Schirer was and why and what he was doing in Germany in the 1930‚Äôs.  The group here at ZMan seems intelligent and well read enough to pass this condition so I won‚Äôt expound.Chapter 8 is entitled ‚ÄúLife in the Third Reich: 1933 -37.‚Äù  It has sub-divisions within it.   Go to the one entitled, ‚ÄúThe Control of Press, Radio, Films‚Äù.  The quote is the last paragraph of that sub-division:‚ÄúI myself was to experience how easily one is taken in by a lying and censored press and radio in a totalitarian state.  Though unlike most Germans I had daily access to foreign newspapers, especially those of London, Paris and Zurich, which arrived after the day of publication, and though I listened regularly to the BBC and other foreign broadcasts, my job necessitated the spending of many hours a day in comb- ing the German press, checking the German radio, conferring with Nazi officials and going to party meetings.  It was surprising and sometimes consternating to find that notwithstanding the opportunities I had to learn the facts and despite one‚Äôs inherent distrust of what one learned from Nazi sources, a steady diet over the years of falsifications and distortions made a certain impression on one‚Äôs mind and often misled it.  No one who has not lived for years in a totalitarian land can possibly conceive how difficult it is to escape the dread consequences of a regime‚Äôs calculated and incessant propaganda.  Often in a German home or office or sometimes in a casual conversation with a stranger in a restaurant, a beer hall, a caf√©, I would meet with the most outlandish assertions from seemingly educated and intelligent persons.  It was obvious they were parroting some piece of nonsense they had heard on the radio or read in the newspapers.  Sometime one was tempted to say as much, but on such occasions one was met with such a stare of incredulity, such a shock of silence, as if one had blasphemed the Almighty, that one realized how useless it was even to try to make contact with a mind which had become warped and for whom the facts of life had become what Hitler and Goebbels, with their cynical disregard for truth, said they were.‚ÄùNot saying that we here in the United States are living in a totalitarian state, but when all the MSM keeps up the false narratives, it weighs.  Every word and insight in the above paragraph is applicable to today.  Here‚Äôs how it might sound from a modern day Schirer:‚ÄúI myself was to experience how easily one is taken in by the lying and censored Main Stream Media in a society whose Masters and governing elites desire and reward the deliberate distortion and falsification of reality.  Though unlike most westerners I had the time to put forth the effort to peruse, on a daily basis, alternative news sources, mainly found on the World Wide Web, (Breitbart, Gates of Vienna, Vlad Tepes, ZMan, many You Tube channels, etc. to name just a few) and though I read and listened to them regularly, I was forced on occasion to listen to the totally slanted, biased, and malignant dribble emanating from any one of the several MSM outlets.  And while I was able to understand this life and liberty threatening malignancy for what it was,  . . .  etc, etc.Hope this ‚Äúhits the spot‚Äù.

                        Shirer is a ‚Äúmust read‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe Rise and Fall‚Ä¶‚Äù was written after the fact, but his ‚ÄúBerlin Diary‚Äù was written in the thick of things, and published in 1941, soon after he was thrown out of Germany.  I dare you to read ‚ÄúBerlin Diary‚Äù, which was a bestseller upon publication, and come away doubting that it was well understood what was going on with the German Jews, even if the mechanics of the process were hidden.  Not to hijack.  Shirer‚Äôs ‚ÄúBerlin Diary‚Äù chronicles the day-to-day life in Germany that he reflects on later, and helps one understand who the real modern fascists are.

        The ‚Äúriots‚Äù and the public response to it shakes out like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXZs3mjGlQUFor all those lunatic miscreants, there are thousands of pretty normal people sitting back saying to themselves, ‚ÄúOh really?  Watch this shit,‚Äù and then they lower the boom on the disinherited.Trump‚Äôs election was two parts reform, and five parts revenge.  His speech couldn‚Äôt have been more of a direct ‚ÄúF.U.‚Äù to the people sitting behind him without Trump literally turning around and giving them all the finger.  It was glorious.Those rioters?  They‚Äôll eventually sober up and go home.  The PMS-brigade marching today?  Same thing.  Nothing really bad is going to happen to them or their supporters, and that‚Äôs going to become apparent in the coming months and years.  You can only scream like that for so long before people just tune you out entirely.Or they sit back, and they wait patiently, and then they strike where it will cause the most pain.  In Trump‚Äôs case, he has the 2018 mid-terms coming up AND THE WIND IS AT HIS BACK if our small, regional, faction-party, known as ‚Äúthe Democrats‚Äù gives him too much crap.

        Aunt Maude who, let‚Äôs say, has voted democrat her entire life, watches the entire show yesterday and notices the contrast between the handsome, polite and well mannered Trump family against the rude, unwashed, green haired crazies and makes a judgment about what kind of family she wants.

            Yeah, but then she‚Äôll watch the March for Women today, and get all teary-eyed about her Sacred Abortion Rights (and be reminded of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpussy‚Äù comment ‚Äî which was taken out of context, but SHE will never know that since the media will never tell her.) And as soon as Trump nominates anyone to the Supreme Court who‚Äôs not a dyed-in-the-wool pro-abortion maniac, Aunt Maude will be receiving hysterical fundraising appeals in the mail every day from Planned Parenthood, NARAL and all the others‚Ä¶ And no matter how many positive economic and other changes the Trump administration working with a Republican Congress may make in her life, the threat to her Sacred Abortion Rights will override all, and guarantee that she keeps voting Democrat.

        These ‚Äúprotesters‚Äù are protected by the police.. and usually do the severe stuff in cities where they know the mayor or police chief has given them the nod.  So police ENABLE these punks to disrupt and inflict themselves on normies.  AND if normies finally push back the cops intimidate the normie or even arrest them to ‚Äúdiffuse‚Äù the conflict.  It‚Äôs only a matter of time, like you say Z and history is replete with examples.Normies have assets, generally respect the rule of law (heh) and have jobs to lose if they do stupid stuff.  I think they, we, will take a lot because we have to.  The left counts on this.  They know this is how it works.  Look at how Bill Ayers is somehow able to flow around and stir up stuff.  That guy should be in jail.  The normies are going to put enormous pressure on police agencies and the DOJ to crack down sooner than they‚Äôll organize and fight back.  If Hillary had been elected and the DOJ continued as under Obama, I think we‚Äôd have been in for a serious threat of normie organization and reaction.  With Trump and Sessions, we have a chance to allow them to do their jobs and restore order and safety to the public square.  We will see.  Interesting times for sure.

            In schools, the leftists call what you describe ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù. Meaning punish the bullied; the normie victims. Now we see the grown up consequences of their insidious leftist experiment with the kids. Time to drain the swamp, indeed!

        The favorite tactic in the country in which I live is blocking traffic with burning tires and club-armed, face-covered ‚Äúpiqueteros‚Äù, as they‚Äôre known. The police stand aside and actually protect them, or they did before the government change here. I‚Äôve had a number of encounters with them and on one occasion grew angry enough to get out of my car and begin to approach them. The police immediately stopped me and told me to return to my car. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm protesting, I want my human rights!‚Äù I shouted, then addressed other drivers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being denied our rights and he cops don‚Äôt intervene, so let‚Äôs have our own demonstration and turn their fuX&amp;%$&amp; car over!‚Äù The group of drivers cheered, but the cops knew their compatriots better than I: nobody moved. Given that I‚Äôm clearly a non-working-class foreigner, the police were very diplomatic and told me that I didn‚Äôt have to wait in my car but had to stop inciting folks and wait by it. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre going to open the road very soon,‚Äù the sergeant said as two other cops went to have a word with the head ‚Äúprotestor‚Äù. There was some gesticulating, but one of the cops signaled his boss who told me ‚ÄúYou can go now. Don‚Äôt say any more. You‚Äôre right, but this is how things are. Just go.‚ÄùMoral of the story? Don‚Äôt cut cops or ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù an inch of slack when the so-called ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù are overstepping their bounds. High-pressure hoses, tear gas, rubber bullets are legitimate civil response to the malefactors.

            Reminds me of the Trafalgar ‚Äúprotests‚Äù in England- 400,000 Muslims shouting ‚ÄúDeath to the Queen!‚Äù- with the bobbies protecting them from offensive ogling by Brits.
Funny how similar these coincidences are- can‚Äôt possibly be a subterranean, choreographed political economy at work.We don‚Äôt acknowledge or measure it, therefore it doesn‚Äôt exist.  How Newspeak.

            If I ever drive into a blue-voting county, and they‚Äôre blocking traffic, I‚Äôm taking this advice from a cop:Run them over. Keep traffic flowing and don‚Äôt slow down for any of these idiots who try and block the street. Here is the deal, you continue to drive and if you hit someone make sure you call 911 to report the accident and meet the cops a block or two away and you can justify stopping further away because you feared for your safety since the past people in this group has shown a propensity towards violence. Since they are trying to block the street and/or cross where there is no crossing you should not be charged with anything. Now, these idiots could try and sue you in civil court, but remember that it will be jury trial and so most likely it will come out in your favor.‚ÄìSt. Paul Police Sgt. Jeffrey Rothhttp://www.fox9.com/news/77034909-storyHe got fired for telling the truth, because he works in a blue county, but it is still good advice.

        My worry, Z, is that the progressives don‚Äôt understand violence (90% have never been in a fight would be my guess).  If this starts to go high order, they will do what they always do, which is to throw money at it.  That will bring out the very worst elements who will ratchet up the violence more.  Lather, rinse, repeat.Of course they are already throwing money at the problem by employing anarchists to break up store fronts and BLM to shoot cops.  They‚Äôll get cocky and eventually try to go into an area where the folks are armed and don‚Äôt care.  So I guess the cycle has already started.  Buy guns and ammo.  Get friendly with the good folks in your town, especially cops, vets, and Guardmen.

        Common sense tells you it is the ring leaders, aka the political and economic elite, their ideological and financing backing, who must be rooted out for what they are, what they are trying to accomplish.I don‚Äôt care what anybody says, this shit stirring is a mark of evil intentions of people who use others as proxies so they don‚Äôt have to get their hands bloody, it is the mark of all tyranny‚Äôs and tyrants.Dirt people do not do these kind of things. It just is not in their nature. That is not to say dirt people are not capable of violence and other extremes, quite the contrary, dirt people once pushed past their moral tolerance make the most fearsome and indomitable warriors, but most are loathe to become violent and relentless just because it is an ugly bloody miserable business fraught with terrible consequences. It‚Äôs called prudence and grace, it is worth everything, until that itself is at stake. So yes, it is playing with fire.There is a noble and virtuous axiom, But there for the grace of God I go.Can‚Äôt speak for anyone but me, that right there is the Whole Armor of God. It is powerful medicine, not to be trifled with.

                It is going to be interesting seeing how far the deep state is willing to go. That will tell the tale. Personally it is apparent to me irrelevance and illegitimacy has become a very serious crisis for the actors behind the astroturf. So they are having to fight a two front war on the will of the dirt people. For us dirt people patience is a paramount virtue, it is everything we hold the moral high ground and defend it. If we have to put up with this circus of astroturfing, all the more reason to keep our powder dry. Let them beat themselves against the wall of our solidarity and righteousness. It will cause them to panic further when they can mot cause us to react on their terms, they end up reacting to our terms,The whole act is predicated on getting a reaction that then they can turn around and say Look! See&lt; they are racists and white supremacists, because as we all know, the 5th column media is just waiting to pounce. Same old tired stick. I think what they haven&#x27;t all figured out yet, nobody gives a rats arse what they or the media has to say. That door closed and it is a new America.But if it is a physical fight they want, by all means, go right ahead. They are going to have to start that, The onus is on them. Not a good position to be in, MAGA rules now. Fear does not. They want a bloody revolution, it is going to be the last thing the sonofabitches ever do.

                    the more interesting (to me) question is how the deep state has been hauled into the light, due to factional in-fighting.  this spy-vs-spy stuff with all kinds of new ‚Äòconnections‚Äô between graph nodes.  the dumbass media ‚Äî like poor befuddled peggy noonan ‚Äî presumes that Trump has no institutional support.  sure as shit looks like somebody big is looking out for The Don.  What if only the tip of the Trumpberg is showing?When the Normans took over England, something like 90% of the previous nobility/elite had been reduced to peasantry within 4 years.   That is what I see Trump going for; total replacement of the political and business class.

                Lets hope so LP.  They keep screaming Trump is a fascist, racist, well really it is us dirt people, guilty in their minds by vote and association. They seem to think the easy cop out of violence and destruction gives them gravatis, when it is to be tolerant and endure is the noble and virtuous path, they have no legitimacy or reverent beef, while us dirt people have graciously put up with the deep state and political class as they strip mined and raped America for decades, for longer than is prudent.Well maybe it is time they are accommodated, alieve their worst fears. I can imagine a phalanx under General Mattis, with Gladius and shield wading into those 5th column rioters. Orders are to MAGA, leave non standing.

        There will be no response from elected officials in America. Organized, low-level political violence has been a constant of left-wing politics in America since the 1800s. There was a brief lull during the WW1 and WW2 era, but it picked back up in the 1960s and has been a mainstay since then. Low-level violence has become an accepted form of politics for the American left.The right has abandoned low-level violence as a political tactic. I can‚Äôt recall an instance of political violence instigated by the political right in America since the hardhat riots in NYC in 1970. Perhaps the left‚Äôs response to the Trump era will reignite the appetite for political violence on the right.The Nazis rose to power in no small part because they were the only ones willing to adopt the street tactics necessary to put down the communists in Wiemar Germany. Perhaps there‚Äôs a lesson to learn there.

        Watching some you tube footage of people in some Washington demonstrations, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how everyone was holding their phone up to record a mostly boring gathering‚Ä¶I struggled to fine one person who was not recording their awesomeness and being a part of something so righteous! Most people were standing around playing with their phones, waiting for someone they could hate to wander by. The Deploraball demonstration is a good example of the righteous hatred and the hypocritical irony lost on the holy children of Obama.I‚Äôm more irritated at the women‚Äôs  rights march today where the interviews reveal how good they ‚Äòfeel‚Äô to know so many others are as despondant as they. They vow to  (in the words of their god) ‚Äòfight on‚Äô for the rights of a long list of acronyms that exclude Trump supporters.  I think what‚Äôs needed is a march in Washington to show support for the pres‚Ä¶. maybe in spring, or the 4th of July. Heck, have Milo lead and organize it just to make it more irritating to the left. The glaring red-filled map of the  electoral college of the US has not convinced them. A march of deplorables may do the trick.

        Saw an interesting comment- that the suddenly shut-down Clinton Foundation Global Initiative was a CIA front like Ford Foundation, the one Obama‚Äôs mother and grandmother worked for in Indonesia and Pakistan.
It would be reasonable to assume that Soros, like these endlessly multiplying ‚Äònonprofit‚Äô fronts, also have the imminity and backing of the Deep State.  His cofounding partner of Carlyle Group, Pappy Bush, certainly did.

                Yes.  The worst mistake made by the man-child #44 was his petulant swipe at the Clinton‚Äôs by not giving Hillary a pardon.  But in doing so, he opened up himself and the Deep State to a world of worry that will have bodies dropping like flies in order to keep the truf from outing.

        The right to peaceful (!) demonstrations was quasi-sacralized in Western political culture at a time before the internet and even before widespread television. At a time, therefore, when people showing up on the streets in large numbers often really was the only effective way to let the rulers know about popular sentiment on given issues between elections. So originally there was a good reason to make the right to demonstrate pretty much sacrosanct.Today though, in a completely different communication environment, the original rationale for this has disappeared, and I don‚Äôt see why we must look at demonstrations with the same degree of political piety.

        Soros and his ilk will use paid agitators to provoke Trump and civil authorities until they finally need to crack down on the violence with militance. The media will be there with cameras and present the story to the world as, ‚ÄúSee, Trump‚Äôs an authoritarian! He‚Äôs killing his own people! He must be removed for the sake of human rights and democracy!‚Äù Much of the public, having their human compassion exploited with misinformation and not aware it‚Äôs a deep state operation, will feel bad for the rioters and agree that Trump is a bad man and we should have someone better in his place. Then the bloodshed between countrymen will begin and the destruction of our nation. We apply this model abroad all the time and it works like a charm.

                It‚Äôs critical that Trump prevails. When he said this is our last chance before we lose our country, he was not exaggerating. Do you think actions and words by media and assorted individuals amount to sedition? I do and I hope it gets brought up ‚Äî soon. They need to cut off the head(s) of the snake(s). They can do this by enforcing the law on past criminal behaviors that were allowed to occur under corrupt leadership, can‚Äôt they?‚ÄúThat if any persons shall unlawfully combine or conspire together, with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the government of the United States, which are or shall be directed by proper authority, or to impede the operation of any law of the United States, or to intimidate or prevent any person holding a place or office in or under the government of the United States, from undertaking, performing, or executing his trust or duty: and if any person or persons, with intent as aforesaid, shall counsel, advise, or attempt to procure any insurrection, riot, unlawful assembly, or combination, whether such conspiracy, threatening, counsel, advice, or attempt shall have the proposed effect or not, he or they shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanour‚Ä¶‚Äùhttp://www.constitution.org/rf/sedition_1798.htm

                        Chuckie is quoting from a totalitarian statute pushed by a guy who thought he should be immune from criticism.  The Sedition Act of 1798 was the antithesis of the spirit of 1776.

        There is a good video, just posted two days ago on January 19, available on You Tube entitled, ‚ÄúAmerica Under Siege: Civil war 2017‚Äù.  From Capital Research Center, written and hosted by Trevor Loudon, 22:36 in length.
Goes into some depth about the working of these subversive groups, names names, and organizations.  Was very interested in the Russian involvement but don‚Äôt know the veracity of what is implied in that section.  Worth your time to have a look, listen.

        IMO, the Richard Spencer attack is a serious test for the alt-right to determine whether there is any muscle behind the movement or whether they are simply keyboard warriors. If the alt-right is to be taken seriously, there needs to be a focused online effort to publicly identify the attacker, publish his address and employment information, locate him, and ensure that swift and brutal justice is delivered to him. The next would-be attacker will think twice if he knows the payback for a sucker punch is tallied in broken bones.

        Hey kids, you ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet. Remember Wisconsin. Think back to the ordeals of Governor Scott Walker.¬† The ‚Äúwymen‚Äù activists will use the same tactics against the Trump administration, but they will be on steroids.Who are these people? NEA, AFT, SEIU, and their allies, various and assorted lefty organizations, NGOs, as well as, anyone else who is dependent on the government trough. Noble, nah; self serving, YES.

        Ive been thinking that a lot of folks patience is wearing thin . There‚Äôs a progression here that paralleles politics. 10 or so years ago when the Bushies went on a spending spree a group called Porkbusters organized to protest. The establishment sat on them. Then came the Tea Party. Obama sicced the IRS on them. So Trump got elected.

            Trump is the last, best shot at resolving all of this peacefully.  If he folds or is carried out, the backlash of the ‚Äúnormies‚Äù will be quite a thing to witness.  White males do two things very well.  One, they organize and connive to be as deadly and fearsome as possible, and no one else does it as well.  Two, they go ‚Äúall in‚Äù, one things get underway, and will not be deterred, once the organized violence starts.  I hope and pray that the weirdos and easily duped are so completely shunned and ostracized, that we never get to that point.

        a couple of excellent movies that I think are very appropos for the situation here in america, now, are:
Missing 1982 Jack Lemon
Salvador  1986 James Woods
and a little gem I suddenly remembered, that made me giggle:
Z  1969 directed by  Costa-Gavras  (look for the dubbed version)

        Has anyone noticed that Jews and Hasbara are egging on the Right to have open war with the Left? I have. In numerous places WN hang out. Vox Day linked to a article where a Jew went on and on about how the Left bombed the hell out of the country and got away with it. Of course he says the obligatory, you shouldn‚Äôt move to violence, but the whole rest of the article is rubbing the noses of the Right into how they‚Äôre such pussies for letting them get away with it. The link.https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/I would remind people that the Ukraine presently has the West Ukr. fighting the East Ukr. and killing the hell out of each other, while a Jew runs one side and a Jew runs the other side also. I don‚Äôt think this is a coincidence.Instead of fighting the left in open warfare we need to focus on pushing the authorities to actually prosecute these people who are terrorizing people and breaking the law. We should also use RICO laws to attack their financiers and jail them.
