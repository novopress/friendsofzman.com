        At 45:20, Bush explains, in watered down language, another important component of the Managerial Class’s immigration policy:http://www.c-span.org/video/?313330-1/former-governors-speak-immigration-reform
“I think Detroit would do real well if we started repopulating it with young, aspirational people.”
In other words, replace the African-American population with Latinos, who are far more agreeable.  I believe Steve Sailor discusses this in the context of LA and Oakland.

            They the open borders crowd is not monolithic. There’s a faction that are simply romantics. They swallow all the stories about America being a land of immigrants and a propositional nation. I’ve always suspected these people just as soon not think much about the issue. Then there are the greed-heads who want to crater the middle class. The Robber Barons of Silicon Valley just like money more than their country. The Democrats, as a practical matter, see their way back to majority status through unlimited amnesty. Otherwise, they remain a fringe weirdo party. The ethno-masacists just hate themselves and their kind. Jeb Bush seems to fall into this group.I do think there is another group in the mix that gets little attention and they bleed into all of the immigration factions. The globalists who have no loyalty to their host countries see open borders and mass migration as a means to an end. They look at what the financial sector of Europe can do to Greece, effectively nullifying their elections, and imagine having that power globally. The world government types have always been lurking on the fringe of Western thought. Today they are much more mainstream, even if they are obscure.As far as the demographic argument, I’ve never taken it seriously as I don’t think they take it seriously. Jeb is basically threatening to kill granny unless you go along with immigration fantasy. That’s not an argument. That’s a threat.

        A while back I posted a long comment explaining why I thought that the real reason behind the amnesty push from both wings of the Managerial Party was the demographic weakness that is poised to destroy the entitlement system that sustains it.  Here is Jeb Bush, the next Party Leader, explaining this in very clear terms, beginning around 11:58:http://www.c-span.org/video/?313373-3/former-governor-jeb-bush-remarks

        Agree with the others – ZMan made a rare mistake. We import the best and brightest from Asia, Europe and Africa but we get the bottom of the barrel from Latin America. Those in Latin America with skills tend to stay there – they export their low skilled rabble to the USA.

        Mr. Z you are all wet concerning the invasion from the South but are correct, as far as I can see, with regards to people leaving Africa and Asia (not including North Asia) for the USA. The key is the Smart Fraction concept which you are aware; IQ is destiny and countries with low IQ populations really cannot afford to have their smart fraction abscond as it were.

            The statistics on the Latinos in America suggest they are the least troublesome oftheir native populations. They are hard working and their crime rates are about the same as low-class whites. Remember, the comparison I’m making here is to their native populations. I do think the smart fraction of Central and South America is staying put. The people who are leaving are those being savaged the by the dysfunctional element within their home country. Jason Ritchwine has made this point with far more clarity.Think of it this way. Detroit at one time had a stable middle class of people with average IQ’s, but strong a work ethic and a sense of social obligation. They stabilized the city and provided the staffing for the smart people running the auto business. Once that stable core bolted for the suburbs, the smart fraction went with them, leaving the the rest to create a Hobbesian hell hole.

        The immorality of the custom damaged the slave master more than the slave by robbing him of his empathyThe many millions raped, whipped, starved, and murdered, whose futures and descendants were cancelled, would like a word with you about comparative suffering.In all my reading on the USSR, I read not one victim of the Gulag ever asserting that the hierarchy of Gulag officers suffered more than the dead and abused.I know of only one concentration camp victim who said (she didn’t survive to write) “I feel sorry for them. Those Nazis must be in terrible pain to do these things.”

        Mexico is not and has never sent us it’s best and brightest.For a time we got the energetic. Now were’re signing them up for welfare first thing so naturally we are getting a different class of people–the ones Mexicans want out of Mexico. And lately something not seen before, Mexican Indians who do not even speak Spanish and are so stupid there is no hope of advancement.
