        “4) All Income Taxed At 12%”
Sales not income? The fed can’t tax income without the 16th.

        Neither the 13th (abolition of slavery) nor the 15th Amendment (suffrage for freedmen) have proved problematic.  It’s a few phrases in the 14th Amendment which are the problem, and mostly because of the intellectual and moral fraud abroad in the appellate judiciary and legal professoriate.It’s fashionable to attribute all sorts of trouble to the 17th Amendment, but that complaint is nonsense.  The effect of that amendment in the contemporary context is to alter the balance of skill sets in Congress.  Absent the amendment, you would get more people adept at building relationships in state legislatures and fewer at running fund-raising and publicity campaigns.  Sen. Dede Scozzafava would have her seat for life.  Public policy would be little improved.As for the 16th Amendment, the trouble is that legislature have discretion to determine the dimensions of the tax base, and that discretion is used to confer bon bons on clientele like the oil and real estate industry.I will wager the schemes in the 25th Amendment will prove unworkable in a true crisis.The 26th, 24th, and 23d Amendments consisted of some modest adjustments to the suffrage.  Not sure why you’re hostile to that. I am not sure why the 19th Amendment (women’s suffrage) counts as a ‘silly fad’.    The 20th Amendment was a housekeeping measure.  Not sure why that bothers you either.You want term limits, but the 22d amendment is a ‘silly fad’.  You did not give much clear thought to this before you posted, I take it.

        My preference would be to return to the Articles of Confederation. That would essentially eliminate the federal government, and most especially the Supreme Court, which is unredeemably evil.The President would preside over a unicameral legislature in which each state had one vote. The President would also have at his disposal a small navy/coast guard, custom houses and a small army. The state militias would be the bulk of the military forces. The whole military would of necessity be defensive.Such a structure would keep us out of foreign wars, which is manifestly desirable. No war since the Revolutionary War, none, has advanced the lives of Americans.
