        And fromthe horses mouthdirectly:
“One United Nations official has admitted that the global warming scare is an effort to destroy capitalism. But that’s only part of the motivation. For others, as a second U.N. official confirms, it’s a religious experience.”

        Green Alarmism does not derive from science. It comes from a religion, the faux pagan worship of Gaia, the earth goddess. She is angry and must be propitiated by the sacrifice of human babies. The white liberals who are votaries of this religion have chosen brown and black babies to be the victims of the rituals of “population control”, “zero population growth” and “reproductive choice”.Why has this bizarre cult arisen among what are supposed to be our most intelligent and skeptical class?First we must observe the collapse of Christian belief in this class.They are all Marxists now, not industrial grade Stalinists, but cultural Marxists theorized by Adorno, and Gramisci, and the French lumpen-philosopes such as Foucault and Derrida. But, even those variants of Marxism demands atheism.Also atheism, especially, the nasty anti-intellectual atheism of Dawkins et. al., allows them to indulge their favorite passion — Contempt for the unwashed masses of Americans — the obese bitter clingers who inhabit fly-over country and cling to their guns and religion.Having chosen atheism does not mean that they believe nothing. As Umberto Eco wrote:“G K Chesterton is often credited with observing: “When a man ceases to believe in God, he doesn’t believe in nothing. He believes in anything.” Whoever said it – he was right. We are supposed to live in a sceptical age. In fact, we live in an age of outrageous credulity.“The “death of God”, or at least the dying of the Christian God, has been accompanied by the birth of a plethora of new idols. They have multiplied like bacteria on the corpse of the Christian Church …”http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3621313/God-isnt-big-enough-for-some-people.htmlThe failure of prophecies of the Apocalypse does not invalidate the religion of Gaia anymore than the the failure of the Apocalypse to occur in the 1st Century C.E. (1 Thessalonians) invalidated Christianity. Such failures often cause the faithful to double down, not to give up.

        It’s pretty hard to get fired up about global warming when the damn near coldest winter on record is upon us.  Oh wait, maybe it’s global cooling.  But if global cooling then the polar bears are not at risk and the oceans will not rise.  Hmmmm, need a new meme.  I think I like your “global staying the same”.  It is new, bold, smart and demands no further action.  We can be called “samers”.

        Half of Republicans believe global malarky is a serious issue? This is the entire problem with courtesy and respectfulness in a nutshell. It’s a one way street and that audience is deaf.
If we begin approaching the arguments of pederasts respectfully sooner or later they will be respectable.

            The funny thing about global warming/cooling/changing/stayingthesame, is it is hard to find anyone who really cares, outside of the managerial class. I suspect this is one of those issues that when asked, people give the acceptable response, no matter what they really think. It’s like diversity. Liberal whites go out of their way to avoid it, but preach it when necessary. It’s simply easier to go along with the prevailing pieties than risk being branded a heretic.
