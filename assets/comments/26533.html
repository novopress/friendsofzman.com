        The demand for weirdos who want to play at being the Elite’s toys seems to be in rapid decline, not that it was ever numerous and after C-Ville dissidents learned to avoid these idiots and politely tell them when they show up uninvited “Put your tiki torch where the sun doesn’t shine.” without doing the Lefts work of denunciation for them.The funny thing is there are real Nazis out there who believe much of what is in Mein Kamph and believe that a tweaked version, usually including room for the church and private organizations  of Democratic Workers Socialism or whatever they call it would be the best system for the  long term good of humanity.They are always looking for the next April Gaede who thinks it helps when you are band mom for a Nazi Bubble Gum Pop act , Prussian Blue if you are wondering used to be on YouTube back before the censorship. Its as bad as you might think.People like that got it through thick skills that no one even though they they think this is a good thing its just stupid.There are also plenty of White people who quietly know like every other group does yours is the best group and you look out for them first .White Nationalists are growing to be quite common too.What sets them apart is they live and work in normal reality, act like normal people are have no interest in playing the elites costume drama.Many don’t “hate” anyone else either. Not that this is sin #1 but you get the point. They are just regular folks.I think this  scares the elite a lot and  its part  the reason for much of  the nonsense about White Supremacy . That serves to scare the few remaining  normies into line, includes in group virtue signalling and theyhope will flush a few out.Its like that meme with the FBI guy with the stick “Come On Act Like a Cartoon Nazi.” and the guy he is poking simply responds “No.”

        Late to the party today but I did get to listen to Friday’s podcast however. My ears really perked up when I came to understand you were advocating restoring freedom of thought and expression and institutional observation of due process. I assume you take this position partly because that’s the ideal we grew up with along with your explicit justification that it would be important to the contemporary public, at least the public we care about in this little corner of the web. I don’t see how that position can be supported by the behavior of the contemporary public which rather convincingly demonstrates its indifference or even hostility to all three ideals, especially the young. I’d be interested in hearing more on the subject in some future essay or podcast. It gives me no pleasure to say I no longer believe in this ideal. It relies too much on truth and reason being primary motivators of human behavior which we can see is false.

        And it helps to have a future-leaning book like Revelations. Something that describes the utopia to be born when all the dark baddies are banished from our world. Expect wokeism to get a Future Textbook like the Jehovah’s Witnesses magazines that describes our great future.

        Trudeau reality:
“Justin Trudeau@JustinTrudeauOfficiel du gouvernement – CanadaI want to be very clear: We’re not intimidated by those who hurl abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless. We won’t give in to those who fly racist flags. And we won’t cave to those who engage in vandalism, or dishonour the memory of our veterans.”

            I’ll tell you what, when my liberal, Trudeau-admiring, Canadian wife starts to make fun of him, something might possibly be happening.

        World building would be at least acceptable if the world-builders did not have exclusive class control over everything. That is why Joe Rogan is getting booted off Spotify. The CEO wants money but the investors want Twitter likes. Guess who has more heft, Larry Fink of Blackrock or the CEO? Rogan will get cancelled. Chelsea Clinton has called for Substack to be cancelled. Calling it the home of grifters. Yes Dept. of Irony, but she’s Chelsea Clinton. Her mom is the next President. So yes Substack will be cancelled. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch played a transgender “Its Pat” type in Zoolander 2, so he’s being canceled from his role as Dr. Strange. Yes the movie was made in 2016 and no one fussed then but Woke don’t care. Disney likes money but it cares about weirdo freaks on Twitter more as their class is made up of freaks and weirdos. See Ghislane Maxwell at Chelsea’s wedding.Twitter rants by fringe weirdos get picked up by big shots like Larry Fink, and now we have zero investment in oil resources by publicly owned oil companies. Leading to JPM and others predicting $150 Brent or more by Summer. Super Inflation ahoy! Meanwhile Brave Sir Robin Trudeau having bravely ran away is bravely labeling the the truckers Putin Agents and White Nationalists.To me this strongly suggests that pick the stupidest, most self-defeating response to any problem, and our ruling class will do just exactly that.

            Trudeau doubled down today – called us people who deface statues, harass homeless people and wave hate flags lol. Oh well, we are still right downtown and honking.

Looks like a blockade has started in both directions at the Alberta – Montana border crossing.

                    Mine’s waving beautifully from my porch.  It actually looked nice as I was driving up the block after work today.
I was talking to a DR friend in Chicago today and he too could only say, “I didn’t think the Canucks had it in them.”

                        Bunch of hosers (99% white crowd) repeating over and over how non-racist they are while terrorizing white libs by honking and revving their engines for 18 hours a day. White libs crying on Reddit demanding genocide of the honkers.HONK HONK clown world has arrived.In all seriousness though, it’s a good start but this pressure needs to be sustained for a long time and ramped up before we can say anything. Even best case, vax mandates go away “for now” and they continue our genocide through open borders while we grill.Not blackpilling, this protest is funny as hell but it’s not guaranteed to make a lasting impact right now.

        Z Man’s article begins with his usual dismissal of fascism, which is a common theme for him.  He says that there are no fascists, and if there are any, they’re weirdo losers.Sincere question, admittedly somewhat off topic:  Given the world that most of us who comment on this website want to create, what other means are there to achieve this goal besides fascism?Defining “fascism” as just a partnership between the state and corporations misses the heart of matter.  Fascism is a government with an explicit mandate to defend a specific ethnic group.While fascism may not be our final destination it seems to be a necessary step.If I’m wrong, how do you propose to surmount our current problems?  Convince the non-whites that they are paleocons or libertarians?

            Traditionalism would be a good start. Things started going seriously downhill when women got the ‘right’ to vote, and protected by law from the consequences of what they voted for. Our ancestors were not heartless and mean. They understood their women, they understood the nature of the black man and structured their laws around a reality that actually existed.

                Thanks Glen.  But how is traditionalism achieved when most of the population in the country (or countries, Canadian brother) isn’t interested in traditionalism?
It seems there must be some imposition.
My temperament would prefer traditionalism to fascism, but I don’t see how we got the former without the latter.

                    This is the paradox: the existing system must go, but then an alternative must be pitched as a selling point to possible adherents.  As Z has noted, by about any measure we currently live under a fascist regime, just that no one can see it since they never expected fascism to be used to enforce an ideology of absolute debauchery.
Truth is though, the alternate system matters less than who is in it.  It’s just that fascism has less of the stink of failure than the competing ideals, to some people at least.

                    Under the present political umbrella there can be no traditionalism. The country is entirely lost to us. We must create a separatist state whose bedrock is white traditionalism. And we must establish safeguards to ensure that what happened to America could never happen in our new nation.

                    Our esteemed blog host has a turn of phrase that I really like. Paraphrasing: “Reality is that which remains despite your refusal to believe in it…”All these other alternate realities only exist because we live in an era of artificial prosperity. Without that… all these artificial realities will crumble away… or become prohibitively expensive for dirt people and cloud people. There is only one reality and ithe longer it is denied, the more punishing will be the circumstances when it reasserts itself. No fascism required, really. It’d be in everyone’s best interest at that point to reinstate merit based venture capitalism.

            As woke has gotten more crazy and more evil I too have had enormous problems with the conditioned response ‘but fascism is always the worst’. But I would never, ever use the word ‘fascism’ to describe our side. It evokes strong negative emotions, even in me. In Normie it’s a deal breaker. Plus, it failed. Which is not to suggest I like all their ideas, and even less with the North of the Alps version.Use whatever makes sense from whatever political program or historical source you can find. And call it whatever you want. But don’t ever call it ‘fascism.’ It just makes the long walk home ten times longer.

‘but fascism is always the worst’. But I would never, ever use the word ‘fascism’ to describe our side. It evokes strong negative emotions, even in me.
Lord, I’ve got my work cut out for me with you guys.  This is like when Jared Taylor stopped using the clear and description term “White Nationalism” for the vague “White Advocacy.”
Seriously, leaving semantic trickery aside, what other options do we have?

                    Hehe sorry man. But seriously, words evoke emotions. If it is hard for me to not cringe at the word ‘fascism’ I just think normies, the ppl we really need to get hold of, they’re gonna hang up right away w that word. Imagine you had THE program to save the Heritage West ready to go, now you just needed your army of revolutionaries. Why call it the least appetizing word? It wouldn’t be their program to the letter anyway, we’d probably want to skip the ‘let’s invade Russia and colonize Africa’ parts. And we’d probably want to skip the gas chamber parts too. If they can migrate here they can damn well migrate back. So why not call it something with less baggage?

            During the AFC Championship game, to start off (I had it on as background while doing some chores) the microphone of the singer performing the National Anthem cut out for most of the song. The crowd just picked the song up and sang it. Spontaneously.So I would posit traditional Patriotism, national feeling, intense regional localism, and sense of pride and belonging to region and country. This leaves someone who moved here from Pakistan or Chad last week, and that’s ok. Its not meant for them. But I would say, its a start, as it sits where people live and feel. Those outside the professional class freak zone anyway.

            I know you are not a disinformation agent but this topic and your responses in this thread strike me as you temporarily playing the role.You choose both Fascism and White Nationalism as the hills we should all die on, really? They are absolute poison in almost any capacity you would utter them and can be cloaked in clever euphemism quite easily so why the hard-on to utterly destroy any traction a movement may get? Were you the dude at the Unite the Right rally waving around the newly pressed NatSoc flag too? They both evoke revulsion across most of the political spectrum and WN in particular has a failed movement stink about it I would never be associated with. Pass.This is the worst possible advice you could give hence why I said you are either woefully naive and rigid in your thinking or you are actively attempting sabotage. Neither is a good look…

                Line is definitely neither sabotaging nor disinforming. I agree w the specific criticisms of using a word like ‘fascism’ you mention. It would be self-defeating, we agree there. And ultimately we want to build a society where whites can live in freedom and security, unlike now.But TBH I think you’re misreading him completely. We are being replaced in our home countries. We are being subjected to Maoist shame sessions or whatever they were called, humiliated and too many actually raped, attacked and killed. My impression is Line F-ing fed up with tiptoeing on leftist egg shields and being afraid of our own shadows. I think it was gutsy for him to put it out there. And I think we should look at fascism, and all other revolutionary ideas, for whatever tidbits might be useful. I realize ideas have to catch on to be useful but this strong emotional response to the mere words ‘fascism’ and ‘white nationalism’, are kneejerk reactions we’ve been conditioned to since using diapers.I’ve already said, if I have any say there will be no gas chambers for anyone. I am against genocide, I just want to get a lot of people who don’t belong here, out of our countries. But I’m done dancing to the leftist tune of what you can and can’t say. And I think Line’s saying he is too.

            The n-word is also the most accurate descriptor for joggers, but we don’t use it because it’s the magic word that turns everyone against whoever uses it.  Say European traditionalism, or European ethno-nationalism, but don’t say “white” or anything that has to do with mustache guy.

        Good to see you referencing “When Prophecy Fails.” I also recommend Crane Brinton’s “Anatomy of Revolution” with its notion that the Reign of Terror or Great Purge cannot last because people eventually demand to return to normal life.
And don’t forget Curtis Yarvin: “there is no politics without an enemy.”

        The oddest thing about all this is that people have been taught to fear or denigrate reality. Somehow or other a real-life experience isn’t quite as fulfilling as an online one. I suppose that’s why these people seem to stay so angry. They know it’s just a simulacrum, and when it’s pointed out to them it removes some of the high they get from it. It’s sad really

        They suddenly care about the sanctity of statues. The Canadian media is outraged that the protesters in Ottawa draped a statue with the flag, and an end mandates sign.A sure fed was spotted pretty early on in Saturday’s events. Solo guy in some sort of camo outfit, face covered with a plastic looking mask, walking briskly through the jovial crowd with his battle flag and suddenly gone, but not before a photo op or three. Now, I, like others on this site, love me a rebel flag now and then. However, in Canada, the symbol is practically poison, and anybody toting one at a much-hyped event like the truckers convoy is clearly a plant. Rumor has it the photograph was by one of Turdeau’s photogs,  which makes the whole thing even faker and gayer.

            I was going to ask what was up with that.  I “get” the rebel battle flag in the states since there’s a lot going on culturally and politically with that flag specific to the U.S.  When I saw some shots of it in Canada I thought it just seemed…weird.

            Justin Trudeau’s remarks today were startlingly mendacious.  He all but described the protests as being something out ofTriumph of the Will.
Either he’s incredibly vindictive and willing to violently subjugate heritage (white) Canadians or else lives in a fantasy world and is actually unaware of what’s going on in his nation’s capital.  Whichever it is, he damn near came close to directly saying to millions of the people whom he pretends to rule, “I hate you and I want you dead.”  For a Francophone, he doesn’t appear to have learned a thing about the causes of the French Revolution.

        LMAO, I forgot the Butt-in-gieg “paternity leave” in the middle of a crisis last year. It is surreal from every point of view. Two males decide to “have a baby”, one of them is in charge (in theory) of important stuff, but he leaves his job a few weeks to nurse the baby (?!?!)So anyways I imagined this farce was going to be exploited as how good a father (mother? theyther?) he was and the leftie press was going to gush about how cute is baby butti. But the thing was so ridiculous that they did not try to make this into anything more.They could still run with this idea someday as the people making fun of it will be casted as haters, homophobes, etc. But it is just ridiculous stuff. Future presidential candidate Buttigieg will have a few kids to show for sure and we won’t be able to make fun of them as we did with Obama as these kids are obviously from some other woman (so conspiracy theories about paternity are out of order). BWT anyone knows who is the father?In clown world the jokes write themselves.

            Pete Buttigieg wearing that fake set of plastic tits around his neck so he could “nurse” his baby just confirmed to me that this country deserves everything it has coming to it.
America is a sick, degenerate insane asylum.  The sooner it collapses and dies the better for everyone.

                I’ve heretofore been against a “burn it down”/”let it collapse” approach, but it’s only prudent to have an evacuation plan–not to mention cash and a change of underwear.

                What sort of demon subverts the natural instincts of an innocent newborn in order to play out their own perverted fantasy?
The bonding instinct with the mother this act is twisting is disgusting.

        A long time ago I got addicted to one of those MMORPGs, as one does. I found the game very immersive on its own, even to the point that I would often dream about it and felt a real loyalty to my clan and concern about the broader events in the game. There was a certain kind of player in that game who wasn’t satisfied with the level of immersion and tried to make it deeper by “role playing” even inside the simulation. i.e, they would make up stuff about their avatars and their back stories and run around chasing dragons that didn’t exist even in the actual game. I always thought this was extremely weird. What’s wrong with just playing the game? Do these people not understand that the game already provides a world and a story, that it’s not a chat room to facilitate a D&amp;D experience? These guys playing pretend IN the game were a reminder that I was playing a game and always took me out of the experience.The alt-right people are exactly like those weird larpers in the MMORPG. The reality of the situation isn’t enough and they impose their own fantasies to make it “real” for them. This explains Patriot Front and  NJP. To them their struggle is a recreation of Weimar and they’re playing their roles while projecting whatever is missing from the actual situation.

        “They live in a reality that says they are the guardians of the future utopia, keeping the world safe from its enemies, which come in many styles and guises. In order to keep this fantasy going, they have to find characters that fit the role of the villain.”Well, in many respects, utopia is already here for the brain addled and inferior minds that prop up the narrative. It’s just that it has to be consequently tweaked because of the human factor. You know, the factor that says that humans can fuck-up anything. Even utopia. This is also proof that the rulers of the left play for keeps, while the right keeps retreating until they die on the last hill they’ve retreated to. If the left wins, they keep the win. If they lose, they come back in a few months, years, whatever, until they win. The left will never ask, or allow to be asked, “Did that change we made really work? Did it make the world a better place?” True believers never question their actions. They are not concerned with what the world will really look like when they achieve all their desires (which is never). They are only concerned about establishing their religion. The victory is the goal. Even if it destroys the world.

                from Pauls letter to the romans, ch 1 :21For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking and darkened in their foolish hearts. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools, 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images of mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.24Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity for the dishonoring of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is forever worthy of praise!f Amen.26For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.28Furthermore, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them up to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They invent new forms of evil; they disobey their parents. 31They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless.32Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do these things, but also approve of those who practice them.

        One thing I recall from reading about the French Revolution is the attempted escape to the Swiss border of King Louis and Marie Antoinette on the flight to Varennes that was one bad decision after another.  These people were supposed to blend with the peasants on their way out of town.  They totally misjudged the loyalty of the country people.  It was literally an alien class of people descending on villages in the middle of the night.  The detachment of the ruling class is just as evident today.   And that includes Canada.  The optics of Trudeau splitting in the middle of the night over some truckers and now faking a Covid diagnosis should tell everyone the cowardice and bad optics of these people.  They clearly found out they made a mistake and now they’re lying, and making it worse.  Something similar will happen in some future incident down here.  Biden will be taken into a “safe location” over something and look even worse.  These people are spiteful, small minded, mean spirited, and most of all…cowards.

            I think the elite “detachment” is mostly a pose.   Because it’s not real.   They can’t escape the homeless, the grime, the garbage in the major cities.  They have to drive through it everyday.They KNOW what it is to be “normal,” theirs is just a conceit where they can PRETEND to not know.  What makes it even more preposterous and fake and gheySomething along these lines I noticed when I first moved to Los Angeles.  At that time, if you were white and professional you wanted to be in the conejo valley, which is calabasas and a few other wealthy small cities on the border with LA County and San Fernando valley.   At that time there was a lot of talk of middle class white people fed up with illegal immigration, and this was the time when many were uprooting for oregon, Idaho etc.  but for the high income people, say in the conejo valley, they could say “oh immigration doesn’t bother me, they’re just people looking for work, nation of immigrants…”.But here’s the point, saying these things was a signal that they had enough money to avoid the Mexicans.  It was a status signifier.  I think similar is when people today act like they don’t know what it’s like to be normal, or what normal behavior is.   It’s about status.   And lots of butt kissing too, which is interrelated to keeping a high income job.Yes, it’s being increasingly ridiculous, the lengths people go to to say essentially “I have a high income career and a big fat retirement plan” .   While the people who care and complain are decidedly “middle class” or déclassé.They are going to quickly learn that a million in the bank and a few million in home equity doesn’t get them diddly squat.   Especially now with places like Florida seeing their home prices go through the roof.  These bougie people are going to be whacked hard by reality.  The cries when they realize they were never as rich as they pretended and they end up sitting at the same restaurants as the electricians.

You once wrote that the middle class basically pays lip service to Woke but doesn’t actually believe it; that’s my take on lots of areas other than California. The upper classes paid even more adamant lip service thinking they could strike that pose because it never would affect them. They are learning otherwise rapidly. It doesn’t make our lives any better but it certainly is a joy to watch.

                    As a resident of the People’s Republic of Clownifornia, I fear that many will escape without learning their lessons.  Almost all of the libtarded boomers of my acquaintance have already cashed out and have fled to Colorado and Oregon, maddeningly destroying those states and making it unaffordable for younger generations.  I wish there was a way to force them to STAY in their Shithole Utopia and live with the consequences of their choices.

They have to drive through it everyday.You misunderstand. I’ve spent a lot of time in various Brazilian cities. Many of them have enclaves of great opulence within sight of dirty peasant favelas (slum neighborhoods). They’re unbelievable. Nothing in the US compares, not the worst parts of Detroit or Gary. You wouldn’t believe humans actually live in them. I wouldn’t keep my goats in one of those favelas.A notch above the favelas are run-down poor urban neighborhoods where your driver never stops, under any circumstances if, by some bad necessity of navigation, he’s forced to drive through (except for Brasilia, Brazilian city planning seems pretty much non-existent).I was fortunate enough to always be staying on the good side of things.The rich don’t care. They do separate themselves mentally. Those people aren’t them.

        Alternate Reality Anecdote–One of Z’s neighbors who I know is a late middle (late 50s) unmarried lefty. She lives in one of the most dangerous cities on the planet, Baltimore, MD. She laments how ‘unsafe’ things are around her now and people only a few places removed from herself she knows have been attacked and even killed in seemingly random acts of violence. (“Gang Initiations” is how her sh1tlib mine squares this when it is in fact simply TNB.)So you’d think she would look at the soft on crime black dems who stand up this entire edifice? Wrong! Marilyn Mosby who is under federal investigation and is as corrupt as any black politician ever? She is clearly the victim of racism!Does she walk out her front door carefully scanning her environment for 16 to 35 year old black males? Why on earth would she do that? She told me she sometimes sizes up men she sees out to ‘profile’ their behavior. Trying to puzzle out if they may be Trump supporters or even worse ‘Proud Boys’. These people are programmable robots who have absolutely no hope or want even, of escaping the Matrix. They are tragically, happily, comically, and blissfully unaware of objective reality and they REALLY like it that way.I don’t waste a single moment of my time thinking about them anymore. The sooner their pets eat them the happier I will be. She will be bludgeoned to death by a “yoof” from behind and in her dying moments she will be furiously scanning the sidewalk as her tiny brains leak out of her head looking for alpha White males that may have somehow gotten the jump on her. Let. It. All. Burn.

            What makes it even more idiotic is the true feelings Jewish people have for blacks.   I have worked with enough and have been close to enough of them to know how they feel about black people.  They don’t seem to have any qualms about pretending to love them in public while in private wanting nothing to do with them.  It’s the stupid white LIbs who don’t have the ability to differentiate between and separate public pieties and personal feelings.  Probably why they are truly going nuts because it has created internal conflict and a schizoid personality with no way of release

                I think you are onto something here, too. The tension between pious catechisms about race and the reality of race tortures them. The move toward censorship is a failing effort to keep reality at bay.
The other group you mentioned has used blacks as weapons against racial competitors.

                Reminds me of one of my favorite stories about how hysterical society is about racism, w apologies to those who may have read it before. Jeffrey Dahmer, convicted of serial murder and cannibalism, once pointed out in an interview from prison that ‘he was not a racist.’ The man’s victims included blacks and Asians.You are convicted of cannibalistic serial murder. Without access to nuclear weapons or a way to hack Wall Street and blow up the economy with the click of a mouse, I would really have to tax the imagination to think of a way to do worse than serially killing and eating people. But you do NOT want people to think you are racist. That would just be ‘over the top..’ That’s how obsessed with ‘racism’ we’ve become.

Its criticism or noticing, or denial of want of any non white by anyone white.
Its refusal to sacrifice your own home, children and culture to an invasion.
Its a linguistic muzzle with the same purpose as the medical muzzles.
Turn a whole culture into emasculated pathetic slaves who refuse to even lift their gaze to the tyranny that is dominating them.

        For the legislature watchers. Its looking like 2022  will be an event horizon year like1998 for Democrats.A faction of the House democrats could expire. The last of the Dixiecrats (Tom Bevill and Sonny Montgomery) retired in 1998 and closed the door on a political tradition that dated back almost two centuries.Jim Cooper. The last White southern conservative Democrat in the house, is retiring due to Republican redistricting. But he might not be the last disappeared. With Collin Peterson defeated in 2018 and Ron Kind retiring, that leaves Jared Golden as the last conservative democrat in the house. And he is in a competitive district with a  competitive race.Not looking good for this critically endangered species in a projected wave year.  They are already functionally extinct and now with this. Will the blue dogs fold? Or the will they cling on, morphing into low taxes millennial hipsters and non whites (the Joe Cunningham model).

                It would be wonderful indeed if attorneys acting for people injured in the collapse were able to find this to be true in the course of discovery. And further, if these decisions to postpone desperately needed repairs could be assigned to specific individuals. Suing the pants off of the city, while also personally destroying the authorities at fault. Then, after that, that insurers of the city were to drastically raise the premiums for their liability insurance.

        “Left is obsessed with fascists, white supremacists, the Klan and so on, despite these things no longer being real.”
Let me throw something out there:  those things were never “real.”  Not real in the sense of the narrative we’ve all grown up with.
They were simply normal/traditional people who the Left decided to smear and destroy.  Those words are simply used to label a normal person a subhuman who opposes against the madness and tyranny of the Left.

            I think the truth is somewhere inbetween their narrative image and them just being ‘normal people fed up.’ Fascism had real problems and while the German version went sadistic and evil, the original Italian version had problems with matching ambitions to military objectives (ultimately so did the German version of course). But they may have been a sadly terribly misguided attempt to address some very real problems. And those problems are the same ones now threatening to engulf and swallow us. At least that’s my current thinking; not that we need fascism but that fascism was not the original evil. And that we should learn from fascism’s mistakes instead of just virtue signalling about how ‘terribly evil’ it was.

                Would like to see why this was downvoted, genuinely feel like I’m missing something.
Franco’s fascist vision seems more workable and relatable, it did stand the test of time better than his competitors, but all aspiring fascists fantasize about Nazi Moon bases instead of the hard working reality of living in a two and half world nation.

        My kids and I have been reading about the muckrakers who exposed the dismal conditions of the tenements. Nothing of this sort of journalism could exist today. The blatant corruption of our elites is in our faces and yet it’s likely just the tip of the iceberg.The plight of poor Appalachians and poor White Americans is utterly ignored. In many cases, it is celebrated.They have been exporting their jobs, destroying their livelihoods, and pumping them full of OxyContin. They have been teaching their kids to despise their Whiteness/heritage and to become homo trannies with 49 genders. They have been importing millions of third worlders. We are experiencing “Camp of the Saints.” All this is an effort to decimate the middle class.Do our rulers truly believe in magic dirt theory? Do they truly believe that the dirt colored “refugees” will have the wherewithal to shoulder the burden that middle class Whites have been carrying?

Probably some do; some don’t. But that’s not the point.
We are now living in a James Bond movie because there really *is* a cabal of evil people trying to take over the world. And the only thing standing between them and their mad goal is the white population of the US. And not even all of them.Anyway, white America has gotta go. That’s what it’s all about.

                Sort of with a leg in both camps I try to oppose ‘glory hogging’ from either Europeans (‘we have a deeper culture blah blah blah’ while sniffing their 74 varieties of cheeses to go with their 73 genders) or Americans (‘Murica ONLY country that can stop evil’) at the expense of the other. So I don’t think it is true or fair to say that white Americans are the ONLY ones standing in their way. Of late Canadian truckers have shown a spunkiness I do not normally associate with the Great White North (apologies to all Canadians here) but am very happy to see. I also hope to see more rebelliousness from the French and Brits and so on and so forth. And, starting with their president, there are a lot of Russians who bring not only outspoken hostility to woke to the table but also a couple thousands of nukes. Putin probably also brings a lot of problems for us. But, one thing at a time perhaps 🙂 Anyway, point being, this is not WW2 where some are just waiting to be saved by others. We shouldn’t offend or verbally castrate each other prematurely. I welcome rebellion against woke anywhere in the Western world. The floor is open, any one of us could be the spark that gets things rolling.

            The elite is extensively using sophistry to confuse everything. They ARE celebrating the decay of rural white communities, they ARE persecuting whites, the ARE leading policies that WILL end in white minority status, they are selectively enforcing the laws that makes it highly dangerous for whites to defend themselves.The other day I saw a youtube video of Hitler’s plans for the eastern territories if he had won the war. Most Poles, Russians, Ukraineans etc would be starved to death or just have their jobs, land taken, inferior status, discouraged from reproducing, slowly removed from the land between Germany and the Urals. EVERYONE would recognize this as genocide.Except for the planned famine part, and Hitler being Hitler maybe a few firing squads but I digress, except for these, how is that policy materially different from what is happening to whites in the West today. I realize the ‘G word’ is inflammatory, in fact radioactively nuclear. But how is it not the proper word for what is happening in the West today? It walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck. It takes a postmodernist to say it is not a duck with a straight face. ‘Words over reality….’

                The YouTube user Endeavour put out a video this weekend very relevant to your post. You might want to check it out, it’s called Liberalism Will Not Save You.He discusses the Genocide problem and how the elite are never going to apply rights or the law to themselves.  He uses the Nuremberg trials as an example. The Nazis were charged with “crimes against the peace” for invading neutral countries, but completely ignored the Allies doing the same thing, like with the Winter War in Finland.  The military almost certainly knew of the Polish executions done by the Soviets (which was only officially admitted to after the Soviet collapse), but they blamed it on the Nazis because they made a convenient scapegoat.   The Japanese were never charged for atrocities like the Rape of Nanjing, probably because the Nazis were the good guys who saved thousands and thousands of lives in Nanjing with their immunity.They make the rules. They enforce the rules.  They will never enforce the rules against themselves.  Appealing to genocide is an appeal for their protecting us/our people.  They are ones doing it though.

                    Thanks, will check out that video. Using the genocide word is not to appeal to ‘them’, the elite, but to discredit them as evil beyond the pale and thereby delegitimize their rule. It is a very small step in an attempt to help undermine them. And if we win we will need ex post facto laws (laws that work back in time) even though they are repugnant in normal jurisprudence. But necessary on the scale of crimes against mankind.

Also, I get that you’re not a liberal appealing to liberalism.  His/my point is liberalism is a sham.  They were always selectively enforcing “the law”  His example of using the Nuremberg trials drives that point home.  They were trying the Nazis for stuff they themselves did.

                    The Japanese also pushed the field of biological and chemical warfare ahead quite a bit. There’s that. Quite a few Germans were kept out of the Nuremberg sham for their expertise and the actual trial was a horse and poney show for the people too big to simply disappear.

                Most Poles, Russians, Ukraineans etc would be starved to death or just have their jobs, land taken, inferior status, discouraged from reproducing, slowly removed from the land between Germany and the Urals.Quite specifically, one tenth of the Ukranians would be allowed to remain, working as serfs and only educated enough to “write their own names, read road signs and count to 100.”This is what modern Nazi nostalgics often forget: yes, they DID have genocidal plans in mind. And this was not just a few loose thought jutted down in a diary, it was also what the Germans had in mind if they’d won WW1, it was in the Brest-Littovsk Treaty.The problem of German Lebensraum was not something Hitler invented.

                    That is indeed what modern Nazi nostalgics forget or ignore. But more to the point, how is that different in outcome for Ukranians from what the elites of the West are doing to whites today? Sure, firing squads may be faster than open immigration and CRT but they lead to the same outcome for the recipient population do they not?
We are too conditioned to being decent and reasonable and using moderate language to adequately describe the truly historical and truly monstrous events taking place before us.

                        We don’t know what the outcome of the current race war will be yet, but I’m fairly certain it would not involve keeping a few million whites along for serfs, that’d be too dangerous.The similarity is that they will be pushed back this time too, and the guilty will face a kangaroo court before we hang them.It’s going to be a long war but I believe we’re starting to see the end of the beginning. Trump was a warning shot from Normie, like Brexit and the European nat-pop surge. Politics is moving quickly these years: just remember where we were before Trump. The globalists were already taking victory laps, gloating at our fate.Soon, we will fight back. And the world will hold its breath when we do.

        This use of the word ‘reality’ irks me because it adds to the confusion. This might get a little tedious but strikes me as important: As a first assumption if not axiom of modern Western thought, there is an objective, observable or deducible reality. To establish and delineate this is the fundamental objective and purpose of science as done correctly. There may be reality not accessible to science but the assumption is that that is primarily a matter of technology. There may also be areas where this (physically true) reality becomes fuzzy. Famously this happens with the Heisenberg principle, less famously I believe it happens in relativity theory as well. So it is true that science eventually runs into some trouble here.However, and importantly, that is not relevant to the ‘realities’ discussed in the article here. These other ‘realities’ are the intellectual equivalent of 2+2=5. Examples are fluid genders, the denial of race (and simultaneous insistence on ‘white guilt’ proving that the most basic principles of logical consistency are being trampled), denial of intelligence and all these other ‘woke’ things.Just like you cannot appeal to Goedel’s incompleteness theorems to save your bacon if you say 2+2=5 these esoteric fringes of physics and such where ‘reality’ is no longer simply defined in science do not mean that you are not either correct or incorrect in far more mundane questions of physical reality.It is intellectually offensive to use the word ‘reality’ about these ‘alternative realities’ because they are NOT realities in the factual sense. They are not true. We have two terms for them, neither of which includes ‘reality’ unsurprisingly. In med school I learned that a psychosis is when your ‘perception of the world no longer bears any connection with observable reality’ or something like that. That is exactly what is going on when you believe your gender is your choice. So psychosis is one of those words, because woke postulates meet the (old, I am sure they are updating the definitions in the American Psychiatric Association in a way that would shock even Stalin) definitions of a psychosis. If they don’t truly believe what they’re saying then it is possibly (by pre-woke, ie sane, medical standards) a simulated psychosis. Something you would normally only be advised to do if you had committed murder in Texas and the DA was waving a ticket to the electric chair in front of you. The other word is ‘delusion’ which is related and is sort of the slightly milder term instead of psychosis.I belabor this point because just like we should not concede the moral high ground, we should not concede the factual, intellectual high ground. One of the problems with our universities is that they have not only become academically sloppy but outright anti-scholastic and certainly anti-scientific. Science is not in the slightest democratic. 500 scholars telling Galilei he was wrong did not remodel the (true) reality of the universe. And therefore we should not humor the insane, just because they happen to have overwhelming political power these days, and call their DELUSIONS ‘alternative realities.’ Because that is playing into their postmodern delusion that words outrank (physical) reality. Instead I am tempted to say we should invite the ‘wokeist’ of the bunch to prove that gravity is just a ‘social construct’, from the top of the Empire State Building.

            ” I am sure they are updating the definitions in the American Psychiatric Association in a way that would shock even Stalin”Tangential, but the APA lost roughly half its membership a few years back when the updated DSM discovered new mental illnesses that correspond with every crime: shoplifters suffer from a new psychosis they discovered that applies only to them, for example. Something similar happened to the ABA about twenty years ago when it decided to take political stands in favor of affirmative action rather than discuss the legal problems with it.The Woke Revolution has been wildly successful on the one hand but it also has discredited entire professions and institutions. Eggs, omelets, essentially. Public health has joined the ranks of the discredited now. Long term this makes society dysfunctional beyond repair.

                The only thing surprising there is that so many psychiatrists had the backbone to not go along with this. Medicine is one field hard-struck by postmodernism, no doubt about it. And this WILL lead, actually is already leading, to decreased life expectancies. Such a F-ing mess!!!

                Religion is outside of what science can handle. In their concrete form they make many claims that are verifiably untrue such as the age of the world etc. But in their two most important traits they do not. Their explanation for the beginning of the universe, or reality in the above sense, is something outside the reaches of science. And when prescribing moral codes they are dealing in what are logical opinions and not facts. Opinions do not have objectively correct or incorrect answers, that why they are different from factual claims.Down the list is that religions are interpretations just like folklore that use a different terminology than science. E.g. stories of werewolves can be mapped onto modern knowledge of man-eating predators or serial killers etc but using ‘antiquated’ terms. But with a possible kernel of truth.Atheism IS its own religion and its creed is ‘I am not religious.’ Despite the ‘I do not actively believe there is no god’ blah blah blah that is exactly what it is, an active belief about something outside the domain of what science can currently handle. And specifically, as you so here prove, it is very keen to proselytize, like most other religions 🙂

You just argued, rather eloquently, that we should not give up the right to an empirical reality. “Outside the reaches of science”, is essentially what degenerates argue when they say gender is not about sex or that math is racist.

                        Shooting from the hip as my comments here tend to be, I may be making mistakes I have to walk back. But, the difference between woke claims and (some) religious claims are that we know woke claims are wrong. We also know some religious claims are wrong. But we do not know the origins of this universe or if there are others (‘heaven’ and ‘hell’ translated to terms a quantum astronomer could understand could be something like ‘two parallel universes, one very pleasant, the other very much not’.)There’s a heck of a difference between saying ‘genders are fluid and optional’ and ‘there are parallel universes and at least one of them is very pleasant and with time running in a different way so you don’t run out of it, ie die’. In math terms they are like saying ‘1+1=3’ vs ‘Riemann’s hypothesis is true in N-dimensional such and such’. We don’t know the answer to the last. The other is trivially plain wrong.And I cant resist, ‘math is racist’ is not like ‘1+1=3’ but more like ‘1+1=blue bananas’, ie. it is not merely wrong, which implies intelligible but wrong. It is unintelligible, which is worse than wrong.

                        The elite is extensively using sophistry to confuse everything.
So do Christians, apparently.
The arguments against religion can be stated in a few sentences, the arguments against atheism need to be served up with a boatload of philosophical gravy to hide the meat and potatoes: Blind faith.
And no, I don’t proselytize (often) because I don’t believe I’ve ever converted a single Christian. But I claim the right to put down a marker from time.

                        TBH, I feel I haven’t been entirely honest with you. I am not particularly religious myself, although I can at moments of strong emotions, good or bad, feel a religious impulse of sorts.I don’t begrudge you that you are a little miffed, I was admittedly teasing you. But I am absolutely logically correct in distinguishing between statements we can easily verify or disprove from statements to which we do not know the answer. Just because we do not know the origin of the universe that does not mean I do not know how many genders mammals have. This is the thing you didn’t pick up I think and it is important; you do not need to solve all problems in math (impossible anyway, ref Goedel) to solve the most elementary problems. Substitute ‘biology’, ‘physics’ or other as relevant to disprove any wrong woke claim.Now this is where I wasn’t entirely honest with you. I am a personal sceptic strongly supportive of religion. Because empirically it is strongly associated with a working society. Traditional religion is highly eugenic (in the sense antonym of dysgenic). The atheism you promote opens the gates to insanity empirically. For reference I would point to Glubb. I know this is not your intention but atheism kills culture. And that is an empirical claim.

                        I’m not miffed, I brought the subject up myself after all, and atheism is not something I care or think a lot about one way or another.The reason I’m not engaging with your argument is to tell the truth, that I’m knackered and not up to the full twelve rounds that such discussions usually go.But just one parting shot before I go to bed and ignore your reply:atheism kills culture. And that is an empirical claim.That may be so but it’s beside the point. I couldn’t choose not to be an atheist even if I believed fervently that it would be better for myself or society.

                        If it is true, and as I say there is empiricism to suggest it is, you could perhaps not promote it then?Well, for one thing I don’t believe it’s true. On a societal level, religiosity is inversely correlated with just about every parameter we measure civilization on: crime, violence, education, income, corruption etc.How religion acts on the personal level is of course a bit harder to measure. Judging by the people I’ve met personally, I’ve seen no big difference between atheists and Christians.The reason I’m NOT promoting atheism is: a) I never converted anyone, b) I have nothing against Christians and c) not being superstitious isn’t on the list of things that define me as a person.Nobody I know talk about atheism or religion – ever – but Christians talk about Jesus all the time so for Christians, atheism is a big deal.But when the subject is living with alternate realities, it’s hard not to point to the elephant in the room; our guys laugh at libtards and RINOs for refusing to take the race pill but then turn around: “Of COURSE Jehova is real! Who else created life, the universe and everything? And no, Shiva is NOT real, what an offensive comparison!”

        OT (but semi related) field report from the Freedom Convoy 2022 (Canadian Trucker Strike). This has been an incredibly whitepilling weekend. Amazing turnout, great energy, great community spirit. They are staying through the week, with the stated intent of not leaving until all COVID mandates are lifted. I predicted a while back that it would just be some Boomers making noise for a while then leaving. The bulk of the truckers and supporters are still there today on Monday morning. They said they’re not leaving. We’ll see.Some good things:– Incredible turnout. Thousands of people, hundreds of semi trucks. The City of Ottawa is crawling with pickup trucks with Canadian flags and “F*CK TRUDEAU” flags. Honking in the downtown area is at an unbearable pitch at all hours of the day/night. Leftists/redditors freaking out and basically calling for genocide.– City of Ottawa downtown area (basically like Washington DC) is fully under siege. 3/5 bridges entering downtown from the North are fully closed, a 4th is severely clogged, and a 5th quite a ways West is also badly jammed. The main highway connector into the core is also blocked – and so is a main East-West parkway. It’s costing the city $800,000 per day just in police costs. Police regiments from at least 3 other cities 5-7 hours away (Toronto, London, and Durham) have been dispatched to Ottawa.– Trudeau has fled the city. He first announced he “came into contact” with a COVID positive person and had to go into quarantine despite a negative test. Then he fled anyways. Today he announced he tested positive for COVID.– Crowd has ignored the media narrative. The media has been pissing themselves lately. This Convoy “has ties to white nationalists” and even Nazis. Somebody got a photo of a Confederate flag and the media has been talking about that one photo non stop. Despite all the media hysteria, White people are coming out anyways. It’s broken, nobody is listening.– Great cross-country unity. Quebecois and Albertans are protesting side by side. More Mohawk and Native flags than I expected. Trudeau has united the old stock of the country, but not in the way you’d think. Saw some full blooded Injuns in semis which is really rare.– White pilling event in general. Lots of serious working men have showed up. Lots of white families, young white guys, rednecks. Great to see young white guys looking good and healthy. Everybody is having fun, grilling burgers in their truck beds, passing out food to truckers, blasting music. Burnouts in intersections, people riding in truck beds. The women from the local area, accustomed to soy nu-males, are getting the tingles from these testosterone fuelled males, probably adding to their psychosis. Saw it many times as they walked past, fully masked – they can’t help but take many second looks.-Demonstrations fully peaceful other than civil disobediance. People on high alert for false flags and bad actors after Jan 6.Bad things:– As usual, many of the White people there are so eager to tell you how they’re not racist. Talked so multiple people who immediately said they’re not racist and that race doesn’t matter.– Relating to the first point, the number of Chinese, Indians, and Arabs protesting was approaching 0. They don’t seem to mind the tyranny. Or just don’t want to disrupt the status quo. This weekend thousands of aliens from India and China have become “citizens” with voting rights. Demographics are still destiny.– Lots of support from white collar people who are afraid to go due to the risk of being photographed.This is a major happening though. There’s a reason the media, and collective Western governments are shitting themselves in fear over copy cat movements in other countries.

            Another down side: lots of Back the Blue bootlicking shit. People are saying the cops are on our side. They’re fistbumping them, thanking them for their “service”, etc. They’re in for a rude awakening when the cops eventually fuck everyone over as usual.
Cops aren’t necessarily pro Vax but they’re always on their own side. Globohomo pays their salary.

                I figure the cops are going around on foot gathering as much licensing and registration information as possible for later issuance of fines, suspension of licenses, canceled registrations, etc.
Not much to be done about that at this point, I just hope the truckers are ready to face that eventuality.

            I’ve been watching livestreams and compilation videos for a week now and much of what you report tracks well with footage from the ground.  The normie-instinct to hug a minority is on full display and makes me question the wherewithal of the protestors, but this appears to be an exclusively white protest, so the opportunities to virtue signal are almost non-existent.I saw a clip on CTV with the mayor of Ottawa.  He was near tears because protestors had draped a Canadian flag over a Terry Fox statue.  On Youtube the video clip was titled “Protestors deface statue”.  It’s astounding how tone deaf the pols and the media are.  The mayor went on to whine about how businesses in downtown Ottawa had to shut down due to the protests and that some people had been unable to leave their homes.  Is this man for real?  Is he possibly so ensconced in his bubble that he doesn’t realize the protests arebecausefor two years businesses have been shut down and people have been unable to leave their homes?There’s certainly a lot of energy and now the question becomes how long it can be sustained?  Trudeau’s announcement that he’s got the coof just adds to the chaos.  It’s reasonable to believe he’s actually lying as a way to stay out of public for a period of time.  But on the other hand it raises the question of why he’s aggressively pushing the jabs when they didn’t stop him from catching Covid.  Ideally, he develops a serious case and needs to be hospitalized, perhaps even dies.  Still, the stories in the media would be along the lines of “Sure he died drowning from fluid in his lungs but at least he was vaccinated.  Otherwise, he would died drowning from fluid in his lungs and…he would have been unvaccinated!”I dug my Canadian flag out of a box in my closet — a relic of my college days when I still played a lot of beer league hockey and listened to The Hip — and hung it from the front of my house in support.  A fruitless gesture, I suppose, but I’m a sucker for hope.  I want these protestors to tear the whole damn thing down.

            The Canadian Truck Convoy, and Trudeau fleeing like a silly rabbit, is actually very white-pilling yes. Concrete walls around the White House, Canadian PM fleeing, we are not exactly up against Stalin or other tough guys, are we? They are incredibly afraid and cowardly.

            Hopefully they learn the right lesson, which is policing is based on voluntary compliance.  Once a certain number is reached, the authority’s only choice is EXTREME force.  They probably won’t send a bunch of armed thugs in to start shooting.  But if they did, what would “normie” do?  Surely the press could not help but show the videos.  How would normie react to seeing truckers and other reputable people being gunned down by the state?I saw a headline the other day saying the convoy for this protest was 75 km long.  At 53ft per truck average, that is about 4000 trucks allowing for some space in between them.  Is it anything like 75km?

            One of the funniest but perhaps true accounts that I read  of why older liberal leaning  Canadians like Justin Trudeau so much is because they see Trudeau as an idealized version of themselves when they were young- ambitious, virile, and super progressive politically.
And by picking Justin in an election, these older Canadians are casting a metavote, a collective expression what 20th century progressive optimistic Canada ought to have been,  idealized in one man.

        In a cruel twist of irony, computer-based simulation of societal &amp; cultural trends has been a mature science for about three decades now and the best of these models are generating predictions that are being validated in real time. Kinda of scary in that as we devolve into a metaverse societal simulation, the only real tool we have for forecasting where this leads is simulation modeling. So where are we headed?For most of our history, our ancestors evolved in a natural environment of hardship &amp; existential threat, and this gauntlet took us to the top of the life pyramid. We are now living in a largely artificial environment devoid of real hardship &amp; culling in which change is occurring at hyperspeed. As such, our natural robustness in disappearing faster than medical science can offset and we are fast becoming both mentally &amp; physically fragile. So where does this fragility lead?Colony collapse. Either natural (disease) or artificial (manufactured mortality, typically war but who knows what novelty will spring up next). The best way to survive a colony collapse is to be as far from cities as feasible, and develop the means to feed and defend yourself. We are descended from those who overcame extreme adversity. The future belongs to those who will fight for it.

            Re: modeling, I’ve long suspected there’s quite a bit influencing events involved. Not talking observer effect hocus pocus, either. To build an accurate model you need an understanding of the rules, the internal logic, or whatever you want to call it, of whatever system. If power is the ability to impose one’s will, and knowledge is power, the implications are potentially enormous.Whether consciously or not, I think nerds see it this way. Hence the preoccupation with hoovering up data, the delusions of apotheosis via tech, the metaverse proto-matrix, etc. Outsmart God, become gods lol.But seriously, there’s something ancient and fundamental about it, going back to the naming of things, at least. Something tied up in language and meaning that people today have become fixated on to exclusion of the physical and mysterious aspects of existence. And the strangest part is that it began as materialism— yet here we are with a new religion and a new pantheon, and it *almost* works!To get back to the original point, there’s something about describing phenomena that gives people some power over them, but not total power, and forgetting that (as people are always tempted to do) will keep the pendulum swinging forever. Idk, deep issues I wish I had the time to put more thought to.

                I always think of the duality of materialism and idealism (I am using it in the sense of opposite of physicalism) as best illustrated by the Sistine Chapel. The Enlightenment, with State of Nature/ Social Contract, Natural Philosophy, Malthusian, Adam Smith, Marx, all those characters, all espouse a material view of the world to one extent or another. However, it always leads to the recreation of a new religion and idealism. I think of the Creation of Adam: here is supposedly a work showcasing reverence for God. The irony is 1) God is designed after Zeus (how heathen can you get), and 2) God looks like a man. A piece that supposedly honors God recreates him in our image, in the same way the materialism of the Enlightenment elevated the creations of man (Science, AI in particular) to a Deity: a deity we are all now forced to worship.I guess the philosopher Dylan said it best: “Gotta serve somebody.”

        “Eric Hoffer famously said that mass movements can survive without a god but they must always have a devil.”Trump was and is the Emmanuel Goldstein for the Left’s 24 Hours of Hate. And it shows as people seal themselves in their perfectly hermetically closed bubbles, they cannot possibly believe there are other opinions or attitudes out there. “Hillary was going to WIN damnit! Everyone I know was going to vote for her! She MUST have been cheated!”It’s like your post a while back on Electric Cars: “I don’t care that electric cars don’t meet most people’s needs and we’ll need to massively upgrade our electrical grid and generating capability I WANT IT! NOW!”As Captain Willard posted: Utter separation from physical reality is the hallmark of today’s Elite. And they want what they want, now, and if they don’t get it SOMEBODY is gonna catch Hell!

        The problem with VR is even when they advertise it, they can’t help but make it look dystopian.  Notice the part with the lady in VR, ignoring her significant other eating breakfast next to her.  Even for the extremely online, there’s something very unsettling about it.

There is also a significant percentage of the population that gets motion sickness at your typical 3-D shooter on your standard screen.

                Second Lifehas been around for close to twenty years. It has a following, but for most people, the novelty wears off and they drop it, because it is not unreal enough for them. Like so much of what comes out of Silicon Valley now, the Metaverse is just a reboot of an old idea with some new marketing and gadgets.

                    Late to state but VR/3D has a built in issue where in it requires twice the processing power as regular old visuals, since it’s rendered twice, thus the graphics will always look (much) worse than the regular ol’ TV graphics renderedwith the same hardware.  I think hardware manufacturers believe that we’re closing in on a singularity where all hardware will render so well that the quality differentiation will be undetectable, but, we’ve been waiting a while for that.  (There is also the “nausea” factor as that is also “built-in” due to practically unavoidable render lag.  I guess I could see howmaybehardware that was high-end enough might avoid it, but no one is going to pay fifteen grand to troll on virtual Facebook).

            Augmented reality will condition normal people to this sort of thing.Remember “Google Glass”? How much it was hated? How everyone was hostile to a perceived loss of privacy with a camera on them constantly?That’s long gone.  “Apple Glass” with AR is coming; fitness apps, navigation tools, messaging, instant picture/video taking….people are going to eat this up….we’ve been doing it on smart phones for a decade, and this just makes it easier.This will be the normalizing people will need to get into the VR headset, as will streamlining the actual hardware and software for the vertigo.Personally, I’m in the E Musk camp:  “Sure, you can go through life with a tv on your nose, I guess.”What’s it going to be?  Space colonization and Mars? Or endless trash entertainment and porn with a computer attached to the head?(Depressingly, I think we all know the answer).

        “Of course, there are real problems, but those problems are boring.”Many of those real problems, particularly the societal and cultural, are irreparable. This drives the demand for pseudo-problems, which can be remedied with pseudo-fixes and realities. The evil economic and public oppression of the White working class, very much a real thing in recent decades, requires the pseudo-reality that they are evil, and by implication, deserve to be hounded to extinction. China’s eclipse of the United States, either pending or already here, requires a demon to be conjured and Vladimir Putin is the designated devil. Otherwise, the people in charge would have to put their livelihoods in jeopardy (this is somewhat true with the genocide of the White working class).A society built on fantasy and reality avoidance will collapse, and this is already well underway throughout the West. This is why we need pockets scattered far and wide to one day reconstitute a semblance of Western culture.

                That’s quite good. Frankly, the PRC his paydirt when grifting trash like Biden and McConnell and Cook and Bezos achieved prominence and showed profound willingness to shake their moneymakers for bribe money.
Xi should publicly announce he intends to maintain good relations with his vassal, the United States, and welcome it to the Greater Economic Prosperity Hemisphere. Of course, as a student of history, Xi has both a revulsion and appreciation of what the Japanese did in Manchuria and is implementing his version here via bribery and biological warfare.

        Utter separation from physical reality – or the constraints of thermodynamics or genetics – is the hallmark of today’s Elite. Pete Buttigieg, the Sec of Transportation, is the pluperfect example: he goes on paternity/maternity leave to “nurse” with a manboob while ships pile up in the offing outside the port of LA and the shelves go bare in American groceries.Veblen observed in The Theory of the Leisure Class that the elite eschewing of  physical labor drove fashion for centuries. This phenomenon maps perfectly onto today’s VR-based Elite, except they now eschew physical reality in its entirety! The insides of their minds in a cooler space than the outside of an oil rig or a truck.It’s gone far beyond the “diverging reality” Zman describes. The Elite now force the plebes and rubes to ignore reality and embrace their unreality: a dude with a full ball sac in a dress is a “woman”; an guy with a manboob is on paternity leave; ships unload themselves; we can run a modern economy on unicorn urine and wind energy, etc. The old emperor had no clothes but the new emperor insists he’s a woman.

                I said that to  my 78 year old mother the other day, regarding the freak on Jeopardy.  If he showed up on the show dressed like a rabbit and insisted he actually was a rabbit, we’d say he’s mentally ill (for the time being, at least).  The same holds true if he came out wearing a diaper and sucking a binkie and insisted he’s really 6 months old.  But if he puts on a dress and lipstick and says he’s a woman now, everyone has to play along.  He should be under the care of a qualified professionals not on the cover of supermarket magazines.

            In the blind pig finds an acorn category, I actually found an excellent piece on freaking National Review about this phenomenon, Michael Brendan Doughtery’s THE NEW WHITE FLIGHT. It is now behind a paywall because it was one of those rare NR pieces worth reading not due to the parody value.Doughtery essentially posits the White Upper Middle Class, the elite adjacent and sometimes the actual elite, are tFUBAR (true) and are responsible for the madness gripping the United States. I certainly would not spend a cent on behalf of NR, but if that piece gets flushed out for free again it is highly recommended. The comments, of course, were quite hostile at times and this writer probably is not long for it there.

                    I read it twice before it went behind the paywall precisely because it was unbelievable. Again, the comments were hilarious: either cucks outraged, outraged that such appeared (one actually whined the Kevin Williamson “gets it”), and a surprising number who agreed and even went so far as to rightly blame women for most of it.

                    Thanks! Again, it is hard to believe that was on National Review. I noticed the later comments started to agree with the writer. Is the insanity now too much even for cucks to gloss over? I doubt it but here’s to hoping.

This is the polar opposite of NR’s routine pablum.

        Spotify signs Rogan to a $100M or so contract, then still manages to kowtow to an extent to a couple of irrelevant old goat hippies.  Neither Young or Mitchell were all that great in their prime and as for now, the vast majority could give a s*** what they think or have to say about anything.  It’d be so refreshing for a CEO or politician to just say F off to some of these whiny assed bastards, but good luck with that happening anytime soon.  Our reality is obviously not theirs.

                            What I find amusing about the Neil Young controversy is I was sure he was dead. When I saw the initial story, I thought it was some sort of publicity stunt. Maybe have a computer generated version of him condemn Joe Rogan. Then I saw a recent photo and he looks like he did twenty years ago, like a homeless guy on his last legs. Wow.

                I should be beyond surprise, but Young’s a guy who played guitar on “For What It’s Worth”, who wrote “Ohio”, and now he’s a goose-stepping foot soldier for the oligarchy?  It must have been a lot more fun to be a hippie rabble rouser before the left took control of every institution in the world.

                    In a way it makes perfect sense: the oligarchs attained power and want to keep it. The Rogan thing has really pissed off Millennials and Zoomers I know. That’s anecdote but it is a good guess it is a common response.
This was really stupid on their part. Some fossilized Tribal writer at NYT penned a piece lauding Young. Her fading relevance and gasping Boomerism almost rivaled Young’s tone-deafness. TPTB really need a better squadron of whores.

                That is another interesting aspect to this. You have people on-line, claiming to be communists, while operating freely on corporate platforms, often subsidized by billionaires. The typical Antifa protest has most of them livestreaming each other using their iPhones and carrying their Apple laptop in a fashionable backpack. Corporate communism is now a thing that seems real to people.

                        Nah, 50-60 years ago most of the hippies were from comfortable middle or upper class families, too. The more things change….

                        The hippies of any note were always children of rank.
You only think it was otherwise because the media painted it thus. Lets take Neil Young, as he is on topic, his mother was a “Daughter of the American Revolution”.
There are multitudes of other examples.The later working class hippies were just there to fund the drug pushing from the same people.
One should not confuse media fiction with reality.

                    It’s all one manufactured “crisis” after another.  Covid, Ukraine, story-of-the-day Spotify crap, etc. to keep the proles distracted.Meanwhile, the ultra rich take their inflated stock gains and cheap money to buy up all the real assets left.So they can rent them back to the dirt people at a tidy profit.  Package them up in huge batches of CDO’s so they can never lose, instantly becoming “too big to fail” with the taxpayer on the hook.Forget neo-feudalism; the “You’ll own nothing and be happy” crowd is crowing from the rooftops that you WILL be their serfs, and you’d better be happy about it.

        Reagan famously observed: “I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.”This is clearly not true, for if aliens were to land, they would be the ultimate “other” and thus the beau ideal of the left’s constituency. But let’s say the aliens were an obvious existential threat, that they exsanguinated our brains through the tops of our heads through proboscises. Might the left finally admit that this “other” was a bit too other? I could see them saying that because of the proliferation of satellites in space/planting an American flag on the moon, we deserve to have our brains sucked out.I guess our current reality proves that, contra all the internet badasses with their analogies, most people prefer the blue pill. Real supply chain problems/hyperinflation, can interrupt their daily intake, though. What happens then? Do the people’s atrophied limbs come back to life, or do they curl up into fetal balls and wait to be overtaken by the orcs streaming in from south of the Border and the Southern Hemisphere? Europe’s got one and a half billion problems headed its way, and everyone’s staring at their screens. It reminds me of the biker in the original “Dawn of the Dead” who was surrounded by zombies but set down his Thompson to check his blood pressure in the mall’s machine.

            I’m not sure I want to lump all of this at the feet of the Left. You see this on the civi-nat Right as well.Hereis something on the civ-nat site Conservative Treehouse. Note the use of the phrase “color revolution”. It is going to become another moral signifier for these people, like “crony capitalism” or “deep state”. Soon the phrase “color revolution” will just mean “bad people”.

                The term “Color Revolution” actually minimizes what Graham is doing here: trying to feather his nest with a proxy war against Russia (all neocons are on this crazy train). It has been interesting that the populations of both America and Europe are so bitterly opposed to this proxy war against Russia. Hell, even Ukraine is telling the Biden Administration this is psychotic. The scariest part is Graham even could be elected to a school board let alone the Senate, although he is far from an outlier in the World’s Greatest Deliberative Body and Whorehouse.A war with Russia might be the one time the somewhat less clueless Civ Nats would revolt against a Forever War for Fun and Profit.

                You can go ahead and lump in a large amount of normiecons in with the left, or, to paraphrase the old chestnut, the shadow that follows the left. Some will “break the conditioning,” to quote even-tempered stoic philosopher Alex Jones, while others won’t. I watched a football game with some normies yesterday, and while the adpersons are obviously saving their big ammo for the Super Bowl (weird, mixed race people with orange spirochete hair and freckles) there was enough nonsense in the playoff for all of the normies to share their honest opinion about the weirdness of it all. They began slowly, tentatively, not sure everyone was on the same page. But once they were sure, the dam broke. They’d have hidden under their beds if I mentioned the Wonderlic test or asked why quarterbacks were usually white and running backs black, but you know what? I think Sailerism is not only a nonstarter, but a dead end. We don’t need more pie charts. We need to have more kids.

                Once upon a time, the term “color revolution” was a closely held internal reference used almost exclusively within CIA field OPs divisions. It somehow got expropriated about a half dozen years ago (probably by a retired spook) and soon became fashionable jargon within the DC cocktail circuit. Now every wannabe black OP LARPer uses it like gang motto. How far we have fallen.

                I was going to mention that the on-ine clique for Trump is about as isolated and delusional as the anti-Trump online clique.  I saw some news about a big rally he had in Texas and all I could think was “who is still showing up to see this clown??”.  I suppose the attendees are affirming their own online reality.
