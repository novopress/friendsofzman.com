        Fifty years ago, an antisemite was someone who hated Jews. Today, it is complicated.
No. It’s not. Joe Sobran said it clearly: “An anti-Semite used to mean a man who hated Jews. Now it means a man who is hated by Jews.”

            Spectacular.I believe what we’re seeing here is an old lefty trick of “taking possession of the term”. They did it with the term “nigger”. I’m old enough to have had a dog named Nigger and no one thought anything of it. Today only blacks may say it and use it in context – theoretically, anyways. But language is a slippery thing and double edged. On Blab hilarious alternate terms arose to describe blacks and black behaviour. “Pavement ape”, “chimp outs”, etc.The jews are trying to do the same thing with the term, “Anti-Semite”. It’s might have worked ages ago but as our host said…the Gaza has opened many eyes. I think as we sink deeper into the era of Weimar America, with jews at the helm…something is going to have to give.Quite frankly I am astonished that they haven’t been exterminated yet.

                As I always try to explain to people, there’s nothing inherently wrong with the word nïgger. It’s just a different form of the Latin word meaning the color black. It comes from the same place as the word negro, negri and any other variations there might be.

                    See how far you go in “polite society” with that academic definition/understanding.  Correct as it may be, it’s a silly argument for the word’s use outside of Black culture. (I use the term culture lightly here.)

The left likes to play word games. They hate descriptive words, usually, when they are ashamed of what you’re describing.
There’s nothing wrong with saying the color “black” in Latin.

                            No, but you can’t explain away or excuse yourself in modern society for the umbrage taken via the word “nigger” in conversation.  That was the point, entomology means nothing to the listener—unless you are lecturing a bunch of academics in a seminar.

                        I don’t know what you mean by “the old days” but I’m 76 and as a child the word “nigger”, while fairly commonly used, was understood to be offensive. I was taught never to use it and that the polite term is “colored.”

                            I just use the word ‘African’ to describe all of them. If it is necessary to differentiate, I say “Americanized African.” However, usually I just say “African” because slurs are counterproductive. An African is an African is an African, by any other name, and the word “African” otherizes them just as thoroughly as an slur, and whatever the context of the conversation or narrative, normalizing otherization is ALWAYS a primary objective.

Often people point out that I’m incorrect.

                        You don’t get it. It’s just a Latin derived word meaning the color black. This is just another case of manufactured outrage, like how the libs get mad when you say the wrong pronoun or when you call someone an illegal.

                        Have you not noticed how they don’t use “undocumented” as much as they used to? That’s because we resisted. You don’t gain anything by cucking to them. The resistance for something like this has to start underground.

Jeez. Canada must’ve been whiter than white back then. I mean really, really, really white. Fewer na-Yeti sightings than Bigfoot.

                    Back in the 70s there was a type of firework called a “nigger chaser.” That wasn’t what was on the package, I’m afraid, but it’s what everybody called them. Now they’re just known as Texas Twisters.

                    It was. I live near the border and I remenber the Canada of the 1970s. “Canadians” were guys like Gordie Howe and Guy Lafleur. Canada was practically synonymous with “white” back then.

                            Funnily enough, the next time I opened Faceborg there was an similar promo for Toronto proper, and the accompanying photo was of black women wearing feathered Carnival costumes.
All the comments were negative, including one that read “100s of cultures, LOL!  As if a mystery meat Fukfest is a selling point.” I continue to be surprised at how far the pendulum has swung toward the noticers in 2025.

                Was he named in honor of the black lab of Wing Commander Guy Gibson, RAF, the leader of the Dam Buster raid? (smirk) In the movie, the dog was run over and killed by a truck, lending an ominous theme to the upcoming raid. It might have been a movie industry contrivance (zut alors!), but sad if it really happened. I’ve heard that the censors have deleted “Nigger” from Richard Todd’s lips, so as not to offend us!

            Agree. The whole thing is just one giant mind trick. It’s simple:Jews are super ethnocentric.Jews play as a team.Jews organize to protect and promote their people.Along with a myriad of other tactics, one particularly effective method (at least against whites) is stopping people from discussing Jewish power or Jewish efforts to influence society and govt by tarring anyone who notices as an “antisemite.” This works in part because Jews have power to harm anyone who they assign that name and in part because whites are stupid and bizarrely sensitive to how members of other races view them.Like all merchant peoples, Jews are trying every trick in the book to rip you off. If you fall for it, well, that’s your fault for being stupid (at least in their minds). Calling you an antisemite is just one of those tricks. Nothing more, nothing less.

                This is really the biggest cultural gap where separation is the only viable option.  Blacks, Jews, Arabs, and Pajeets all share this attitude that the blame lies in the sucker for falling for a lie as opposed to the liar.  It’s why they can have high average IQs with shithole countries, advanced civilization requires a certain degree of faith in the importance of the truth.

            “Anti-semitism” is on the rise for a few damn good reasons. First, the Jews really do have disproportionate control over institutions of power — banks, Hollywood, the media, academe. No, they don’t control “everything,” but they control a hell of a lot more than would be randomly distributed to 2% of the population. They are economic, legal and intellectual elites, and as elites they bear responsibility for the things that are fucked up in this country. Chuck Schumer is not a “victim” of anything, he’s the fucking Senate Minority Leader.Secondly, the “browning of America,” the intentional importation of tens of millions of nonwhites, and the intentional exacerbation of nonwhite racial consciousness has had the unintended effect of creating a class of millions of nonwhite lumpenproletarians who see Jews not only as religious and racial enemies, but also as class enemies.The Egyptian guy in Colorado who threw the Molotovs at the Jews shouldn’t have even been in this country with his five Muslim children. But he was, and he brought his geopolitical, cultural and religious enmities with him.Additionally, “Nazi” stuff is 80 years in the past. Young nonwhite kids couldn’t care less about Hitler or anything that happened almost a century ago. Not only are they historically insouciant, they haven’t been exposed to all the Anne Frank stuff and the Holocaust lore that the Boomers were taught in the Sixties. They don’t see Jews as victims, they see them as rich, arrogant white people.Finally, as Dr. Mearsheimer pointed out 20 years ago, Israel literally does control U.S. foreign policy in ways that are detrimental to the interests of the U.S. itself. He remains flummoxed by this, but as the absurd, craven, and servile U.S. response to the Gaza situation indicates, it continues unabated.

                    It’s not merely that they won’t assimilate; I don’t even think that that’s necessary. It’s that they use their vast wealth to wreck and reconfigure their host societies in ways that infuriate the heritage peoples. They just cannot resist jabbing the bear over and over again with a sharp stick. Is it any wonder that they sometimes get mauled as a result?

        Fifty years ago, an antisemite was someone who hated Jews. Today, it is complicated.

ha. Being anti semitic is now opposing pedophilia, transgenderism, diversity, black worship and feminism.  It’s also supporting White solidarity and White identity.

Be a college professor at an Ivy League school and call for White genocide – no problem.  Criticize the j00s and there will be press conferences, antisemitism bills passed and the FBI, ADL and all of the other regime arms will be sure to get involved to crack down.

As far as I’m concerned, they make themselves impossible not to hate.

            The Zman was entirely correct.They mean to repair the world by getting rid of us, since we stole their rightful place from them.
A jewish character in the Sopranos, Hesh, told a black rapper that “we were the white man’s nigger in Egypt while you guys were still chasing zebras.”
And, notably, his woman was black; jews think we white boys should like that dark meat like they do.

            Living near Portland (the bad one) I meet a lot of “well meaning busybodies” but most are Baizhou (upper middle class White goy). It seems that they, and not the local Jews are the ones doing the most “healing” of the world. Since most of these people actually grew up quite sheltered either in the suburbs or lily-White places like Portland, they have no idea how awful most non-Whites (and Jews) really are.This is why they fall for stuff like “harm reduction” approaches to drug addiction and “solving homelessness”. In the case of the former, this means legalizing all drugs and handing out clean needles. For the latter, it means handing out ever more freebies to the homeless, which of course attracts ever more drugged-out work-averse and mentally ill people from all over the nation.I think the Jews mainly just encourage and egg these people on.Baizhouturn every place they go into the same kind of decrepit shit-encrusted hellhole that Port-a-Potty has become. Maybe this keeps the decent people in the community busy trying to fix all the problems they create so they don’t have the time for a good old-fashioned pogrom. Baizhou are the chaff and flares the Jewish planes drop to confuse the missiles.

Had no good reason to visit Corvallis except had always seen the name in HP calculator manuals. Didn’t hate Corvallis.

Baizhou could be (oodles of phoneme ambiguity sans tones or ideogram use) interpreted as White Week… and we’re not settling for anything less than a month!

                    A few years back I had to drive into Port-a-Potty fairly often (thankfully no more). For a while there was a little group of protesters with their gay little signs at Portland State. The signs all said “abolish ICE”. The protesters? a collection of fat, unattractive White college girls with freakishly colored hair. Of course. Not a Latino among them.

            Most people are actually very Jewish in their outlook even toward the problems of Jews. Faber fahey points out the real issue with the two great forces in the world are what he calls organized naturalism: freemasonry and Judaism. Seeing to a world from a purely naturalist standpoint and possessing a purely naturalistic end, it’s not surprising that Jews want to heal the world only from this standpoint. To them this is all there is; so longer life, education, economic security are ultimate ends: not eternal life

        There’s a Hitler lurking around every corner, who can’t wait to get the ovens fired up again! OMG!As I’ve said on other pages, woe be the poor downtrodden Jew. It must be hell going through life being so discriminated against as to end up being the wealthiest or second wealthiest group in America. If it wasn’t for that glass ceiling of hatred, just think of how much more wealth you could hoover up. Poor Larry Fink. Just think of how many more trillions he could skim off of.The real reason people can’t stand Jews are many, one of them being that so many of them are simply pushy, annoying people. Just read the Ulysses S. Grant letters from the time of Civil War Reconstruction.I remember one time when I was a kid I made a joke about Jews to my orthodontist and I got about 10 minutes of him venting how much he hates his Jewish patients. Never satisfied, always complaining about things, etc. (His office was adjacent to a Jewish neighborhood.)And now that Jews run our foreign policy, of course, the only way they know how to do things is to bully people into submission. And, of course, the world hates us.I hate not being able to open up a newspaper and hear about them or their stupid little postage stamp-sized squatter’s paradise they stole from the Palestinians. Every single day of my life! I won’t go so far as to say “you know who” was right, but sometimes you can’t help having those thoughts.

                    Strange thread.
Traditionally, the white Jew fears the “Sephardic tinge,” an impurity in the woodpile signifying congenital criminality. Old mobster mugshots don’t look like Scarlett Johansson.
And the Mizrahi… No one’s ever lost a lawsuit to one, I suppose, but they will steal your bike. Definitely the aspiring rappers of the Jewish rainbow.
The “foreign students” in the news right now have some solid claims, but the one that’s definitely wrong is that Israel is evil because it’stoo white.

            I’ve concluded that MacDonald is right about Jewish genetics. Of my many Jewish acquaintances, even the nicest and most reasonable seemed to have a bit of a paranoid streak. Or maybe it’s just growing up being taught you’re a victim?

                A lot of them seem to construct their own bizarro world of contradictory ideas and behaviors. I know this one guy, who’s actually from Israel, who is all of these things: a gun and knife collector, a highly partisanDemocrat, a guy who has cameras set up to watch his house which he checks from work all the time to make sure the local hobos aren’t on his lawn, and a guy who keeps finding the most ridiculous and obvious gold-digger women to date. The most recent one basically took over his house and kickedhimout. He did finally regain control of the property but he was couch surfing for a few weeks. Oh, yeah, he’s also a workaholic who practically lives at work, when he’s not being kicked out of his own house, and allows his customers at work to make him do huge amounts of extra work for them.Now in his case, I’d say the paranoid streak (which he has in spades), is justified. However, it’s clear that he walks into most of these bad situations and doesn’t learn from them. He’s basically a Woody Allen level caricature of a neurotic Jew. I just can’t help but think this is genetically determined behavior to some degree.

            I became pro Palestinian when I found out that the indigenous Christians of the Holy Land, Christian communities dating back to the time of Christ, are overwhelmingly on the Palestinian side. (We see the Palestinian cause through the lens of being bombarded with pro-jewish propaganda.)
And then you have the other issue of being a displaced people. You can’t blame them for not being happy about it and for fighting back.
Jews look out for their own tribe, so why shouldn’t I? (My tribe being Christian.)

The Arab Islamics began as Macabbees who accepted the Heretic as a prophet and their path back to power.  It was then that the enmity between Merchant and Bedouin began in earnest, sealed in blood with the massacre of the Medina.

                The Palestinian issue is complicated because it’s a geographic term and therefore encompasses Christians, “Chreaster” (I don’t know the Islamic equivalent) Muslims, secular Levantine people, and die-hard “Dar al Islam” fanatics among other groups. Lebanon let in Palestinian refugees. What was their reward for this? Acts of terrorism and an immediate attempt to overthrow the Lebanese government. There’s a reason none of the neighboring countries want their fellow Palestinian Muslims. Israel is utterly evil in their pursuit of genociding the non-jewish inhabitants of Gaza and the West Bank, but that doesn’t make me reflexively pro-Palestinian. Middle Eastern Christians may correctly point out that Israel is the clearly “wronger” party in this interaction, but I don’t hold any illusions that Christians would be able to practice their faith with any amount of freedom if the problem of Israel wasn’t unifying all of the non-jewish inhabitants of Palestine against a larger problem.

                Many of the original PLO and Palestinian leadership indeed were Christians. It is widely rumored that the Islamists often brutalized and marginalized them later at the urging of Israel, which wanted to minimize Christian influence in the PLO so as to make its eradication more palatable to the United States…see, they are killing the people who are murdering your co-religionists!
That aside, both Tribes are Bronze Age savages and I’m rooting for injuries.

                    I lean towards disliking Israel more simply because, without it, there would not be so much money (stolen from us of course) and weaponry flowing into that nasty sand pit. They would all have to figure out how to kill each other on the economy plan. In a perfect world of course, the mothership from ID4 would show up and turn everything from Egypt to Turkey to glass. It would also be one less thing the ruling class here can use to distract the public from the fact that they are destroying the country.

                “I became pro Palestinian when I found out that the indigenous Christians of the Holy Land, Christian communities dating back to the time of Christ, are overwhelmingly on the Palestinian side.”Poor decision making IMO.  One can feel for the Palestinians in Gaza, and of course decry what the IDF are doing to them—which is over the top to understate the Israeli incursion, but still have a realistic understanding of these people.Hamas simply didn’t happen like a disease spreading in a benign environment.  The Palestinians allowed them to happen.  Look at these people’s modern exile experiences across the Arab world and you’ll see wherever they land, they stir up trouble and revolution.  They’ve been thrown out of every Arab State where their numbers became significant.  Jordan barely won the “civil” war the Palestinians started in Jordan a few decades ago.  At that they had to give up the West Bank so the expelled Palestinians would have someplace to retreat to from Jordan.It’s not for nothing Egypt sent troops to the border to keep the Gaza refugees from fleeing into Egypt.  We might note that Gaza was once under Israeli control and was turned over a couple of decades for the long wanted Palestinian “homeland”.  The first thing the Palestinians did was to turn Gaza into a military base and training camp—and here we are today.A pox on both their houses….

        Re Buckley:He was a conman. If you got back and look at his very early writings, Buckley held the conventional Establishment Right attitude toward Jews and Israel, with the former viewed skeptically as a potentially problem population, and the latter as over the top. Once it became clear that he could grift off Jewish donors, Buckley became the most pro-Israel, philo-Semitic person on Earth. The man’s entire life and the so-called “conservative movement” he created were transparent frauds.As for today’s podcast topic:The Israel First lobby is on borrowed time. If there is a single issue where generational change will make a difference, it is here. As Boomers recede and die off and younger Americans/”Americans” come to the fore, outright hostility toward Israel will transition from private sentiment to public policy. One of the primary reasons for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza is this timing reality is understood, and Netanyahu realizes the barbarism required will not be permitted in the near future. So he’s killin’ while the killin’ is good.As for Jews themselves, and there are many exceptions here (Miller looms large among those), the encouragement of mass migration was the biggest self-own ever among a people prone to self-owns. Not only is Israel on borrowed time, but the diaspora in Western nations is as well in no small part due to the hostile imports and the reaction to them. It probably looked good on paper as a way to check the goys, but flooding the West with savages has managed both to inflame native populations against Jewry and to bring actual anti-Semites into close proximity to the Tribe. It was insane.

            Bingo. Jews screwed the pooch by flooding the West with the brown horde. In their minds, the only way to prevent another Jewish holocaust (and, yes, they believe the story is 100% true) was to bring white Christians to their knees in their homelands. As a beaten down minority, whites could never organize another societal attack on Jews.
Naturally, completely lacking self-awareness, it never dawned on Jews that
1) the brown horde might hate them too2) their middle-man skills evolved to be used best on whites3) Majority brown countries suck

        Not done with the episode yet, so maybe you get into later, but the part about anti-Semitic incidents increasing every year made me think of the story that just happened in Boulder. A Muslim immigrant commits the incident and is the kind of person groups like HIAS have been pushing to bring into the country.  Then they immediately throw out buzz words to manipulate the public, calling a woman who spent WWII in the Dominican Republic a Holocaust survivor because her family left some tiny island in the Adriatic Sea in 1939. How do they expect their complaint to be taken seriously when the cause is a combination of policies they support and their own dishonesty?

        I’m looking forward to listening to this. Every “conservative” publication now is basically on full time antisemite watch. New York Post is trying to make criticism of Israel a disqualification for mayor of NYC. These publications are also conflating this criticism with antisemitism – which of course it always was, but they used to try to separate the two to maintain some plausibility. Now, not anymore. But of course this will just further degrade their credibility. We had at least a decade of full on “cut down the tall trees” anti-White propaganda and these publications did little more than furrow their brow and say “wellllllll it’s uncouth but not a violation of free speech.” Now, they want people destroyed for criticizing a foreign nation. It’s hard not to notice.

        Jewish organization predates Hitler and the holocaust.  I was banned from twitter for mentioning the fact that the ADL’s beginnings were to protect Leo Frank after he turned out to be a  pedo murderer.  The ADL predates holocaust.  The world jewish congress predates the holocaust.  The literal day Hitler became chancelor, organized world jewry declared a boycott on all German goods and advertised in the papers.
The idea that the web of jewish interest groups was erected to prevent a second holocaust is laughable.

            HUAC was created along about 1936 by a couple senators–including Samuel Dickstein of New York–for the purpose of hounding and routing domestic fascists. All well and good, right? Well eventually HUAC fell into the hands of the Right who used it to hound and rout domestic commies, a great many of whom were Finkels. Not so good. Now we’re incessantly harangued about how evil rightwingers used the fundamentally anti-American  mechanism called HUAC to oppress sainted (((political dissidents))) in the early 50s, with Joe “Dis Pater” McCarthey in the van. For some very strange and puzzling reason, the origins of HUAC are never mentioned…

                I have read a tiny sample published non-fiction in English from the 20th century.  After WWII, it’s quite clear that if any references to Jews were allowed, it had to be entirely positive. The last time the West was having active open discussions on the JQ as the late 1920’s into the early 1930’s. WWII obviously finished the consolidation of Jewish influence over mass media.  That Joe McCarthy had to go against “communists” (in fairness there are more than just the group in question) is about that over the top influence that becomes just the social norm.

        The word/accusation is very useful in ostracizing and silencing those who are well meaning who have seen their world go to ruins stopping to say, “Hey. I notice these things. What is going on here? Why is my country being ethnically invaded and yet bolstering the imperial expansion of an ethnostate 6,000 miles away? By the way, the guy coordinating the invasion is of this background and many of his organizations being used to do it are of the same background. What is going on here?”Then this word tells you to shut up or be cast out of society, which is of course a violation of our society’s legal first principle – freedom of speech.It isn’t complicated. You claimed it as your century. Some want to ask how that has and will continue to work out for everyone else. But, that means you want to throw someone into ovens is used as a way to silence the questions and honest discussion about whose civilization this is and how we want to save it.

        Something for the readers here to consider and look out for:  Was having an argument online with someone recently over inflation, and how if .gov spending isn’t cut and soon it will get much worse.  They didn’t even argue themselves, but asked chatGPT where inflation was coming from as a counter argument………….I knew people were stupid, but after that i am convinced they really do not think for themselves at all.  Thankfully AI answers are very easy to spot, for now, since they read like a college textbook.  We’ve gone from bots trying to chat you up on dating apps to people using ChatGPT to argue for them.  We’re doomed

                There’s actually a concern among the AI people that we’re going to reach a point where AIs are being trained mostly on the output of… AIs. Here’s a paper in Nature about thisAI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data. The paper is pretty thick with math but the basic idea seems to be that AIs, fed on their own output will converge to the point where they produce a very narrow stereotype reflecting the average of the original training dataset with none of the variation of the original human generated training data. This is what they mean by the “disappearing tails”. The obvious joke here is that Redditors are already essentially just meat based LLMs and this recursive catastrophe has already befallen them! 🙂https://imgur.com/iiClcBb

            Read any thread on X these days and you have some idiot asking Grok to explain a tweet to them. And they will uncritically believe whatever Grok tells them. No wonder the security state wants control of these AI algorithms. Not only to keep them from going full Tay but because they know that most people will use the AI instead of whatever critical thinking and reasoning skills they possess and they could shape their minds in a way that Bernays could not dream of.

                The main reason we issue debt when we print new money is so that, in theory, the existing money supply isn’t diluted in value. Nice theory, but it doesn’t work. The paper funny money issued by our government has consistently lost value.

                    exactly, in theory, the money supply should shrink when debt is paid back or defaults. They still let that happen to the commoners but i think they’re trying to even delay that now these days. Was talking with a guy on my block two weeks back. His ex wife hasn’t made a mortgage payment since last December…But if you continue to ramp up asset prices, in theory, the money supply could never really shrink even with defaults now and again.  Assets become to high for anyone to buy with “cash” so you continually ramp up debt to chase the prices.

                    The usurious system exists because capitalism shunts a disproportionate amount of wealth to the ownership class, which means there is insufficient buying power among the plebes to purchase what is produced. The deficit is made up by loans at interest, which shunts even more wealth upward. Eventually, the debt cannot be repaid and an economic crash ensues. This process has been going on for quite some time. The Spanish Habsburgs defaulted on their debts to the German Fugger family in the16th century. The Fuggers charged 6% interest on their loans, which the Habsburgs were unable to repay even with the vast wealth they were extracting from the Americas.

                It essentially said that inflation had many different factors and can’t be pinned on just one thing (such as interest rates or growth in debt).  She also tried to claim high housing costs are due to a “housing shortage”, which is bullshit, because if prices were organically growing builders would be all over that.

            AI chatbots exist because Google made itself unusable due to censorship of material deemed “mis/dis/mal information,” their de-indexing of sites they disagree with, the destruction of google cached view, and their shameless pursuit of advertising revenue. This wouldn’t be a problem if they didn’t have a default monopoly on indexing internet searches. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it’s not doing anything more or less impressive than conducting a boolean search of indexed pages and summarizing information found on the most relevant pages (provided the info fits within its reasoning paradigms). The problem is whether any of the pages with the pertinent information is indexed or whether it conflicts with its pre-ordained reasoning. I was taught how to do boolean searches in middle school. It’s only in the past decade that I’ve been unable to find informationI know for a fact existsthrough Google and have had to resort to Yandex and Duck Duck Go. Their search indexes aren’t quite as powerful as Google and sometimes I can’t even find information I know exists through their searches.

            Agree with regard to ChatGPT, but I use it all the time.
Here’s how (IMHO) to do so legitimately.  1) Always cite your source such that there can be no confusion as to who’s commenting. 2) Use AI only to supplement/correct/add to what you pretty much know, or rather to extend your posted commentary/thoughts.  3). If the meaningful majority of your post is quoting ChatGPT, consider not responding at all as you do not really know enough to respond/comment—and your audience has access to the same source if they wish.

                With regards to finance and the economy in general, chatGPT is only going to pull from approved sources, who have an incentive not to even acknowledge the argument i’m making.  So what would be the point in using it?

                    The point *could* be to find a concise itemized list of contra positions and then address them from your own knowledge base.  To assume that ChatGPT is fed only from “approved” sources is difficult to believe.  Rather I believe your positions are for one reason or another not mainstream and therefore a LLM will weigh them accordingly in any response.  This is important and illustrate (IMHO) a major flaw in AI as I experience it today.There was recently an interesting posting by Robert Malone,https://www.malone.news/p/busted-the-daily-mail-and-xs-misinformation?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=583200&amp;post_id=164947389&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=tq4xf&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=emailin which he queried and then challenged a GROK AI produced response to his question(s).  Malone is, in his own right, a content expert in his field of medicine.  His queries were wrt statements published concern a purported measles outbreak.  He challenged GROK as to its answers and after repeated queries got GROK to admit it replied to his inquiry incorrectly and finally admitted Malone was right all along and that GROK was using *secondary* sources for its answer—in short, here-say!The aspect of the question first put is secondary to my interest in his experience.  What was interesting was that a human could “converse” with an AI and move the response from “certainty” to “uncertainty” to acknowledged as “incorrect”.  Of course this took a very smart human content expert, Malone.  Most of us are not in his league!

                        That’s how AI/LLM is supposed to be used. It teaches you and you teach it and at the end of your query you both have learned something. I don’t think you have to be super smart to do this, just informed enough to be really curious about the subject you are asking about.

        Antisemitism is not something endemic to European gentiles. This is plainly shown by the low in-group preference we have in relation to any other race, and to Jews in particular. Nevertheless, we have felt the need to deconstruct our societies in an effort to extirpate that sin from our midst. In reality, Jews would quickly become assimilated within the diaspora absent some measure of hostility towards them; thereby removing the advantages their tribalism brings. Which is why they must continually gin up as much evidence of ongoing persecution as possible. It is why they so brazenly celebrate their predations on the Palestinians, while literally basking in the sense of revulsion this elicits from thegoyim. Without it, they imagine they would practically cease to exist as a distinct people.

            All Lutheran to me: no hierarchy, just the “priesthood of all believers”, every individual interpreting religion how he sees fit  plus the Holy Ghost inspires each individual interpreting religion his choice, and a government to manage all these little gods. Also with the abandonment of a unifying religion, religion begins to weaken and love of God, the ultimate “other” will soon weaken. I think a new “other” in the person of the minority has replaced God

        The old dual-loyalty canard….. Like protesting on American streets flying an Israeli flag.To accuse certain ones of them of dual loyalty is to assume they have any loyalty whatsoever to the US.Or like when they went around posting missing person posters in US cities when Oct 7th happened.  As if there was a single one of these “missing persons” in the US.What ever happened to Germany efficiency?  Why are there so many “holocaust survivors?”   The foreigner flying foreign flags who got attacked was supposedly a holocaust survivor.  She would have been 8 years old in 1945.  The Germans couldn’t even get rid of an 8 year old?  Obviously it’s a lie.  The term “holocaust survivor” has been changed to anyone who was anywhere in Europe during the war years, not somebody actually in the custody of the Germans.

            I say there were so many ‘survivors’ because they were somewhere else, having migrated far away and so missed the Blessed Event. Thus, they “survived” it’s mythical happening.
For instance, the 3 million who had lived in Poland. The train lines from the transfer camps are half hour to one hour away from the border- minutes away in the case of Sobibor- and cash-strapped USSR is going to instead ship millions of troops without weapons or often uniforms from deep incountry, who go on to avenge-rape Germany? German complicated schemes rather than simply sending them on to their fellow kommisars?

                I was reading an except from a book whose name I do not recall, but it was filled with letters sent from regular soldiers on the front lines back to their families in Germany.One of these letters I read was from a German photographer in the war.  His letter said he came across the queerest scene in Lithuania.  He said there was a group of Lithuanians  in any alley surrounded by 3 walls.  In it, they had Jews from the town lined up and were beating them to death one at a time with various make-shift implements like crowbars or bats.  Supposedly these Jews had been the commissars who would report the townspeople for whatever they might have done (or just made up phony crimes) causing many of them to disappear.AFAIK, Jews were massively over represented in communists.  You have to wonder just how widespread this phenomenon was.  Just how many revenge killings happened during the occupations.  Not just of Jews either, just generally.  The Germans were greeted as liberators in at least some of the Eastern occupied territories.  Life under the commies was not just hard, but relied on luck.  Being falsely accused of being a reactionary or counter-revolutionary or saboteur was widespread.  There were a lot of scores which needed settling.

                        I don’t disagree.  But if Jews in general had a high interest in communism, they make natural commissars.
Not only that, but there is another angle, again human nature, abusing your position.  I won’t turn in your husband if you….  Or, if you give me a discount on my meat, I won’t turn you in for your wrong think.

Nor do I, but I’m not a cheerleader either.  I tend to avoid the situation.
As I can bemoan the Ukraine/Russia “brother war”, I can take a position on the Palestinian/Israeli conflict as “Too bad they both can’t lose!”

                            This is also a problem of diversity. When different tribes cohabit, the negative behaviors of the Other will become more readily apparent than the negative behaviors of the Same. And this will lead to reprisals if the opportunity presents itself. Now this isn’t one of the most pleasant human traits, but bottom line, without diversity it simply doesn’t exist.

        The idea of anti Semitism being solely related to Jews is very Jewish. There are over 300 million Semites mostly Arabs. It is generous to say more than a tiny minority of Semites are Jewish.Using logic (which is inherently anti Semitic) the real anti Semitism is ashkenazi Jews from Europe killing Arabs who are actual Semites. It is even more laughable when Arabs in the US or Europe are accused of Anti Semitism for criticizing Jews who have never even lived in Israel.The whole Semitism racket lets Jews pretend they are all from Palestine. It is the Jewish equivalent of blacks claiming they built the pyramids.

        I am afflicted with a cognitive dysfunction that makes it impossible for me to care what others think of me or what opinion they may harbor about my assumed biases. If someone attempts to accost me with a presumed insult by calling me a racist or antisemite, it usually doesn’t even register in my consciousness unless they also attempt to physically assault me. The latter would actually be a rare gift as it would enable a justifiably tangible response. Once upon a time, this was how societal scourges were dissuaded.

            I’m pretty much the same. When I was young, I lived and died with the opinions of others about me. But the older I get, the fewer effs I have to give about what anybody thinks about me. The latter is great for one’s mental health.

        I thought it was a pretty good show. The point about Soros’ strategy turning into an own goal on the global stage is a good one. Rather than being the divide and conquer masters of a mongrelized former civilization, the strategy may well turn into a situation where creating this situation has made everyone pissed off at them and being a cornered minority to blame for everything.The internalized victim narrative may amplify that ire as it will be interpreted as intransigence.For our part, those of our race who want to endure, the only thing that matters is who we are, what we want and what we are doing to get it. Hopefully, fatigue of focusing on everyone but ourselves will set in soon and we can put all of our energy on us – which in the end is all that matters. That is the most basic rule of success – focusing on you and what you need to do to attain what you want.

        It originates with the rabbis. They need to fill the seats and obtain the funding. A most reliable means is to develop enmity between their tribe and Rome. Us versus them, in group v. out group. By any means necessary. So they stoke conflict continuously.If I taste jew in my sandwich this is because there IS jew in my sandwich. The rabbis marked the ingredients in my sandwich with their tribe’s  symbols. Almost none of them or their flocks keep strict kosher. If I was to command the marking of all fish sold in the US with the picene symbol of Jesus Christ or an image of Christ splayed out on a crucifix, the rabbbis would escalate hostilities and burn down the fish markets until they got what they wanted. Anti-Christianism.I hate the jew because I associated with them from early in my life. I learned and know they hate us, and it starts at the rabbinate. Necessary hate both directions.We must answer “the question” with permanence or else the jew will eventually destroy us. They cannot relent or reform. We cannot relent or amend. One side or both sides will end.

                One would have a real actuary to weigh in. However I know enough about the background to that I would question that number. The veryyoungesta survivor could be is 80. We know that back then people didn’t live as long. Let’s say 65 was life expectancy. At a guess, the median age of someone in the camp was 35. Now assume that no one had died prior to 1945 when they were all released, that all six million were alive when the camps were freed. While it does happen, very few people live to be 115 years old. Certainly not 200k/6000k = 3.3%.Pull the other finger; it plays bells.

                    Speaking of ChatGPT, that’s a good question to pose.  Here it is:”🎯 Final Answer:If all 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust had survived 1945, then by 2025, roughly 150,000 to 200,000 might still be alive — almost all in their 80s and 90s, and nearly all of them would have been children during the war.“Now we go into the precise definition of Holocaust survivor—one who was in the camps, or simply one who was affected via persecution, or fleeing, or hiding.  And of course, the timeline is important since not all victims were caught up in the melee in the early 40’s.  Hundreds of thousands of victims were rounded up as late as 1944-45 (Hungary for example).So 200k is feasible as a number of living victims.

                        Compsci, no, it’s not feasible, for the reasons I’ve elaborate in my other postings here. Just for fun, I worked through the calculations again and got generally the same results.Given a starting population of 3.5 million Europeans (of any type) in 1945, they would likely have had an average life expectancy of about 63. I don’t have any hard figures for what Jewish holocaust survivor average age would be, so I guessed 35. To properly answer the question we’d need a proper “Life Table” for such a population. Idohave access to such tables for the U.S. population, which you can easily find here:https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6_2004_TR2008.htmlPlease note that’s a link to an agency of the Federal government, not some far-right anti-Semite site.Now, “Anna” claimed 200,000 Holocaust survivors still live. I Wikipedia’ed “Holocaust survivors” and got additional figures from thee. Anna’s figure isn’t too far off from Wikipedia’s – “As of January 2024, about 245,000 survivors were alive.” I don’t know Anna’s bona fides, but at the very least, she deserves credit for accurately reporting figures from “reputable” sources.For the starting population, I rely on that entry’s figures: 9.5 million Jews (1939) in relevant areas of Europe; “nearly” 6 million “murdered” through 1945. I’m not disputing those figures, that is an argument for others to make. The key result here is that 9.5 – 6 = 3.5 million, which is thus our putative population of “Holocaust survivors” in 1945 at end of hostilities.The question I’m trying to answer is simply this: Given a starting population of 3.5 Million in 1945, how many “should” be alive in 2025? As I’ve already noted, I don’t have good actuarial data for that group; therefore I’ve had to make some assumptions.We need the likely life expectancy of Europeans (I asked Google for Germans in 1938). I was told by AI Overview “61.4 years for men and 65.7 years for women”. I average those two and get 63.55. I rounded that to 63, properly it should be to 64.Now I had to get a bit further into projection land. Ideally I would have a life table for Europeans from about 1938. I’massumingthat median life expectancy was age 64. What that means is that by age 64, half of the starting population has died off.Now look at the Life Table. Ideally, we would know at what ages half the population remains. I interpolated 78.5 for men and 83.5 for women. Average those and you get 81.As you can see, modern Americans have a life expectancy about (81-64) = 17 years longer than WW II era Europeans.Given the Wiki claims, we are told that (in 2024) 245,000 of 3,500,000 starting population were still alive. That would be exactly 7% remaining. Now let’s look at theAmericanLife Table (since it’s the only one on hand): At what age are there about 7,000 remaining alive (of 100,000 at start)? I get men = 93, women = 96, averaged = 94.5.From that figure alone, one can infer that since 80 years had passed since 1945, that the starting population would have had average age of 94.5 – 80 = 14.5 years. Now I admit I can’t be sure, but I’m pretty sure the average Jew in 1945 wasn’t under 15 years old. And remember, we are using modern American life expectancies in this exercise! Now let’s estimate – as best we can – what the figures would look like with a 1938 Life Table.I made a linear approximation: 64/81 = X/94.5. Solve for X and you get 75 (rounded up).Now again, let me reiterate that I’m working from assumptions here. Perhaps there’s an error. But I’ve gone through the arithmetic twice now and gotten similar results. Note that last calculated figure (age 75) was beginningfrom birth. Forgive me for belaboring the obvious, but it’s the key point: What I just calculated, if the assumptions are correct, means that the 200,000 (+/-) left alive claim could only be plausibleif the starting population of 3.5 million had been born in 1945!!!Let that sink in for a minute. I’ll wait.The mean age of the 1945 stating population is unknown, but it damned sure wasn’t zero. Given reasonable guesses for the stating age, that necessarily means that the 200,000 remaining population figure passed by some decades ago. In an earlier post I speculated as early as 1985. But even with a much younger population, it wouldn’t have shifted it later by more than a decade, maybe.

                    I should have used better figures: Using source Wikipedia “Holocaust Survivors” I get these:Pre-WW II European Jewry = 9.5 million.Number killed in camps, etc. (approx.) = 6 million.Remaining alive at end of WW II = 3.5 million.Wiki also reports still-living survivors as a bit more that 200,000.That seems implausible, for the same reasons I gave in my first posting.I asked Google for German life expectancy in 1938. I got (average) about 63 years, so my first guess was pretty close.Modern Americans have a life expectancy easily 20 or more years longer. Since I don’t have a Life Table for 1938 Germany, let’s pretend those 1945 Jewish survivors had modern USA life expectancies by magic. What do the figures show? Well, that 3.3% remnant of survivors would have been reached at age 99.  Let’s think through exactly what that means: It would mean that since 1945 was exactly 80 years ago, that Jewish survivor mean age in 1945 would have had to be 99-80 = 19 years. That seems a bit unlikely, doesn’t it?And remember, that 1945 Jewry probably had life expectancy around 63 years, thus their die-off would have been far earlier (to hit the 3.3% remnant) I lack the proper tools, but at a guess, a 63 year life expectancy would imply the 3.3% remaining to be at about age 75.Restated: Even if those 3.5 million had beenborn in 1945, by about age 63 (2008) half of them would have expired. By age 75 (2020) only about 200,000 would have been left. Again, this would have been a populationborn at the end of the war!!!With the above guesstimates, what about those survivors who we’d expect had an average age of perhaps 35? Well, they would have hit the 200,000 remaining mark about 35 years earlier, in1985!!!There’s no way in hell that there are 200,000 (+/-) “Holocaust Survivors” alive today,ifthe starting population was 3.5 million in 1945.The youngest possible living “Holocaust Survivor” today has to be at least 80. Since in most cases we are dealing with people who were at least grown children or adults in 1945, the case is much as with WW II veterans: sure, there are still a few alive, but they are very much outliers. For most statistical purposes, there are none left alive.

                            I’m not currently a ChatGPT user. You seem to think its data is more reliable that Wikipedia’s, which I think is a category error. Both of these are “mainstream” resources, likely curated by the same gatekeepers. In fact, for the current topic, all the better that we’re employing “official” figures for the Holocaust™.No, of course I would not believe what Wikipedia claimed about so-called “Climate Change”. But to repeat, they can be relied upon to provide “official” figures for the current topic.The harder-to-come-by figures are the actuarial data, but even those should be non-controversial. From those I merely am arguing – employing my admittedly rudimentary analytical skills – that the claim of 245,000 (approx.) living “survivors” doesn’t stand up to even elementary analysis.

                                “You seem to think its data is more reliable than Wikipedia’s, which I think is a category error.”Your logic is faulty—to an extreme.  You deny Wiki bias while claiming ChatGPT is unreliable, albeit you’ve no experience in using ChatGPT.Wiki articles are written and rewritten (edited) by human editors.  These editors become ranked and therefore they approve or disapprove of alterations of lessor ranked “editors”.  I cited one well known example of basic editor bias wrt to Climate Change articles on Wiki.  You’ve cited nothing wrt to ChatGPT because you admit to never using it.(Disclosure, I once wrote an article for Wiki in its early days which was completely accurate and supportable with third party evidence, but was in essence rejected/deleted by senior “editors” because of such personal bias as I cited.  It was at that time that I explored the underlying fallacy of the organizing principle of Wiki.  Once I became aware, I no longer considered contributing or using such a media.)In short, with Wiki, you have “proof/validity” by consensus of an (unvetted) elite.  This is why I’ve stopped using Wiki and why Wiki was *never* allowed as a citation in any paper submission at the university level!  Can’t say what HS’s do these days.With ChatGPT, you’ll often get citations for reference and you can ask/question those aspects of the AI answer for clarification and “challenge”.  To that effect I cited a recent “Malone” article above.  You’ve cited *nothing* except your skepticism and your own speculation/assumptions wrt certain numbers of survivors.  In short, you are your own ChatGPT!That’s fine, but don’t get “butt hurt” when someone challenges such.

                                    I donotdeny that Wikipedia is often biased. My opinion was that its figures given related to Holocaust survivors would likely not be biased, since they would be expected to report establishment views.I stand by my assertion, or call it my paranoia if you like, that ChatGPT should not be held in any higher regard than Wikipedia. These are nothing more than information retrieval systems. Broadly speaking, they rely on the same primary sources for input data. Much more problematic, however, is to realize that the entities that process and curate that data likely have similar policies on what data are collected and what’s allowed to be shown to the end user. Sure, there are differences in the implementations, but let’s face it, for any controversial topic, or for certain facts or even opinion that powerful interests would prefer to remain hidden, it’s not as though you’re going to get a straight answer from ChatGPT and a blank stare from Wikipedia or vice versa.I concede the point that I’ve hardly ever used a ChatGPT type AI. But for all practical purposes, I can get much the same information by diligent Google searches.I also concede your points about a source such as Wikipedia being largely human edited and thus gatekept (is that a verb?) to a large extent.But I still fear you seem to place just a bit too much confidence in ChatGPT. Do you really think that ChatGPT, or any other AI, is exempt for the very same chicanery that plagues Wikipedia or any similar web resource? Yes, I’m sure it can cite references. One problem with AI is they can “hallucinate,” including making up imaginary citations.I’m well aware that Wikipedia is discouraged as a source for academic work. That should not disqualify it (or an AI) as a source for ideas. It does mean that one should verify citations when possible.In closing, you may be pleased to know that I did some more googling on the original topic (Do ~200,000 Holocaust survivors remain?) and guess what – I found out that my above claims are wrong, wrong, wrong! I found two sources that I’d estimated in my earlier “work” and I was way off. Average age of Holocaust survivors in 1945? I found an answer closer to 8 (I was surprised how young!) – rather distant from 35 I’d pulled out of my, er, out of thin air yesterday. And I did find some life tables for Germany (I only looked at the ones for 1940s) and thus got reliable actuary data, rather than the (in retrospect) sloppy extrapolations I used yesterday.I’ve posted a few “retraction” notes above, including to Anna’s original post. Again, I waswrong, wrong, wrong!By the way, thank you for sparring with me on this. I’m not butt hurt, but it is a bit ego deflating when I have to admit I was wrong about someone else being wrong.Well, gotta go…I believe I have a retraction to post on Derb’s latest blog.

                At first I was dubious about some of these figures, and I posted much verbiage and debate below showing my “work” proving (I thought at the time) that the 220,000 figure was wrong. However today (Saturday) I found added resources and guess what?  The 220,000 (or 245,000 for 2024) estimate is very close.  Therefore I admit that I waswrongin the other comments I’ve made below.If anyone cares, one of my flawed assumptions was the average age of Jewish survivors. After some googling, I came up with an estimate of 8 years old. I was suprised that it skewed that low, but that is what a couple sources say.My life expectancies may have been a few years low; I said 64, but found German postwar life tables showing closer to 70 (Link)https://www.lifetable.de/Country/Country?cntr=DEUApologies for any feathers ruffled.

        Maybe someone can explain to me why “anti-Semitism” only applies to Jews. Arabs speak a Semitic language, do they not? Jesus spoke one too. Hebrew speakers aren’t the only Semites in a land full of them. When I think “anti-Semitic”, I think one rather hates “For you my friend, good price!” type people.
We might as well change “anti-White” to “anti-Indo-European”.

        Mr man is not an antisemite . But seriously, sometimes I forget about Jews and then they remind me they are not going to shut up unless they are shut up. Since it’s summer I thought I’d look around for a Sumer song and then I remembered an old girlfriend’s favorite song from the late 80s (wonder what she’s doing now???) called Summertime Rolls by the la alt rock band Jane’s Addiction.so I found a live version in which the lead singer, Perry (not his real name) Farrell is telling the audience that Jesus is a nice concept but, explains the ex stripper, the Jesus story is a hodgepodge of ancient myths that pre date the historical man/God. In other words, Christianity , the foundation of the west is just a made up concept. now, Mr Farrell is a Saturday person. And I’ve learned that to find a Saturday person blaspheming is really nothing shocking. It’s who they are.

        Negative identities, which is anti-antisemitism, must always preserve that which it claims to oppose.
This calls to mind the fact that, in the wake of Pierre Trudeau, Canadian identity became primarily defined as “Not American” (previously it had been “loyal British subjects” but the anti-Anglo ethnic animus Trudeaupèreinherited from the long generational struggle between Ontario and Quebec moved him to fatally wound Canada’s Britishness with the insidious concept of “multiculturalism”).

        Theodor Herzl, father of modern zionism:“The anti-Semites will become our most dependable friends, the anti-Semitic countries our allies.”Nothing galvanizes the jewish people like anti-Semitism. It further entrenches the necessity of strong in-group preference and creates a universal enemy they can all rally around. If this is the case, then you can understand why they’re seemingly begging for more anti-Semitism. I suspect a lot of the egregious jewish posters on twitter are doing just this when they relish in the death of Palestinian children. I’ve been wondering why jewish propaganda does nothing to try to rehabilitate their image anymore. Why is Dave Portnoy having a multi-day neurotic episode which is obviously intended to create more anti-Semites. Imagine having that jabroni and Rabbi Shmuley as your people’s ambassadors…ridiculous! Are they trying to incite a reaction so they can push their anti-Semitism laws more effectively? So many questions…

            The 88 year old woman set on fire in Boulder Colorado by Mahmoud Solimani, an illegal alien from Egypt, who overstayed his tourist visa and then was given an extension by the Biden admin, is a good example.She was a member of HIAS, and has lobbied extensively for more immigrants. This is pretty much bog standard. Ashkenazi Jews view their chief enemy as the ghost of the German bad mustache man, and thus the way to avoid that enemy is to flood the Western World with as many non-Whites as possible because then the Colors of Benetton will buy the world a coke and teach them to sing. The South Park guys regularly mock this sort of thing as it is very embedded in the Upper Class and among Ashkenazi Jews.Mizhrahi / Persian Jews have no illusions about the “sacredness” and innate non-White goodness of the Third World. Having lived among them for generations. It is similar to Whites from Scandinavia who emigrated to Minnesota being totally delusional about vibrants, while those from the Scots/English border regions who settled in the South have no illusions whatsoever about vibrant vibrancy.The woman, born in 1937 (it is possible she was barely a H-cast survivor at the end of the war) and other elderly Ashkenazi Jews (average age of 70) in the March were marching for the hostages still “held” (probably dead) by Hamas. This incensed Solimani who btw is not as far as I know a Palestinian but an Egyptian Muslim. Just as the couple who were murdered by the son of the SEIU bigshot in DC were “peace activists” who sought to end the War while working for the Israeli Embassy.There is a reason the Bibi Govt. exists and why the Peace Movement is dead in Israel. Attack after attack makes the Palestinians feel good, but erodes any movement in Israel to make any deal with them, on the view that the Palestinians cannot be trusted, their motivation is Jihad, and the best way is to kill most of them before they do it to Israelis, and move the rest far, far away. This is the motivation for ethnic cleansing of Germans in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other Balkan nations where the Germans (mostly Saxons) had lived since the 1300s.I don’t really care about Palestinian kids. They hate me for my skin color and would happily set me on fire next  so I have no sympathy. I don’t care that much about the Israelis, not my people, but I understand that they are viewed by the Left and non-Whites as “Super Whites”  (tm Paul Kersey of SBPDL) so I have no illusions that after the Left and non-Whites finish with them, I will be next on the menu. So in that sense I wish them well having fun storming the Castle.

        Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, which is to say, He is the fulfillment of the Torah. The Torah being the theoretical basis of the Jewish identity means that a rejection of Jesus Christ is a rejection of this core identity. What passes for semitism today, largely due to a high degree of control over media and politics, is a negative identity in direct opposition to the Torah. The anti-Semites are the natural reaction to a toxic anti-identity.It is important to get this correct for many reasons. One is that the Christian West needs to accept that “Jewish” interests are fundamentally incompatible with Christian interests and Christian societies. An inclusion of these people is to invite a spiritual war of identity and anti-identity into your nation. “Every single time” is the observation that the anti-identity is highly motivated to undermine then destroy the true identity in order to supplant the true identity in an inherently existential war. Again, Nietzsche’s Will to Power. There can be no other way.The reason the ADL exists is because the semite anti-identity believes it should be exempt from God’s laws, nevermind human laws in general. It also exists because “Jew” fatigue is on same moral level and operating on the same dynamics as SJW fatigue. The natural reaction to a toxic anti-identity must be ruthlessly policed or it will create an unmanageable situation very quickly.To reduce this to a high school drama, the anti-Semite is the slightly spergy, socially awkward guy who is just clueless enough to commit the faux pas of stating that the popular girl is a total bitch. While correct, this still gets him run out of polite society, which causes him to become even more neurotic than he already is. The drama between him and the popular girl gets tiresome for all, so the “trouble maker” is increasingly shunned in that overly feminine way. The tragedy is that the spergy guy would calm down considerably if polite society were honest enough to admit he has a point.Which is why the popular girl is on a crusade to crush all men under her heel forever. There is always another young man who is either clueless enough or virtuous enough to speak the truth about here right around the corner.

            Antisemites aren’t just spergy dudes saying impolite things.  They obsess on the jews.  They even blame jews for bad whites.  There is not one thing wrong with the world they cannot bring back to their favorite people, no matter the tortuous logic involved in doing so.Criticizing Jews, particularly the Jewish elite is one thing.  Lots to criticize there.  After all, they are just a group of foreigners who shouldn’t even be here at all, let alone in the elite.  But the antisemites just take it to a ridiculous degree.  They are very effective at making criticizing any jew look ridiculous and mentally unhealthy.

        Actual anti-Semitism is a form of racism. You don’t like Jews because of their DNA. What we have in the USA now is mostly something different: an objection to the behavior and activities of Jews (the Z Man alluded to one of them: their support for mass Third World immigration). The Jewish response is to conflate that objection with anti-Semitism. For instance, if you object to Israel’s slaughter of the Gazans, you are a Nazi. As a practical matter, if you oppose any of the favored projects of Jews (e.g., abortion, sex perversion, mass immigration) you are a Nazi. This is why Trump, a philo-Semite if there ever was one, is massively opposed by American Jews. Jews in Israel have a different opinion, since he has been Israel-friendly and Israel is dependent on American support. His positions on other matters don’t affect them.

            I disagree with you.  Most people who hate blacks, for example, hate all blacks.  It doesn’t really matter whether or not a black is part of the elite or a guy slinging dope on the street corner or a saleman or clerk etc.Antisemitism is more or less directed at elite Jews, not the rank and file.   Nobody ever talks about a Jewish conspiracy to control waiting tables or laying flooring.  In fact, the antisemites deny such Jews even exist.Almost all the criticism directed at Jews is because what the Jewish elite want and push. A lot of the evil things elite jews push is done in the name of Judaism. “As a Jew….. I support this evil thing” along with the hypersensitivity to any criticism of any Jew in world history.  They still defend Leo Frank, FFS.  The ADL still openly celebrates him.  This guy r*ped and murdered a 13 year old girl who worked in his pencil factory.  Elite Jews all over the US rallied to his support and sent him millions of Dollars (in the 1920s).

        The phenomena of anti-Semitism exists, but in general if you agree with Amy Chua:World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global InstabilityIt exists also for the Chinese Diaspora in SE Asia, for the Igbo in Nigeria, and other places. Essentially, Chua wrote the book to explain to herself why her beloved aunt was murdered by her servant in the Philippines. For those not familiar with her family, she is the low achiever. Her father was a Nobel winning physicist and her other family members have distinguished careers in science and medicine.The resentment comes from the disordering of capitalism, which puts a premium on ethnic networks across national and linguistic borders, disruption to traditional economic systems, and great wealth accumulation by the ethnic insiders. Who also have generally higher IQ than the surrounding population and connections to government officials.The dude “Whatifalthist” notes that Jews in the Middle Ages after the Dark Ages were confined to ghettos, which made their social development radically different. A high trust society, that was uniform, no ability to form a warrior caste, or need for internal policiing bred into the society nonsense utopian ideas that did not and could not scale beyond the Ghetto. But Jewish intellectuals pushed because in the small ghettos this system DID work. Interestingly, Israeli Jews are vastly different. If you read first hand accounts of particularly the 1967 War, the junior officers were eager to prove that indeed yes, Jews could be very effective warriors and had “fighting spirit” and not the passiviity which they openly rebuked from 1933-1945. Israel indeed has a warrior caste, and passing through the Israeli military particularly for its tech sector is a rite of passage.Those acquainted with Iranian Jews know they are very culturally Persian, and are proud of both Persian history and their Jewishness, and want the Mullahs gone. They tend to have a sense of Shia-ism in their outlook, making them very different from Jews from the Northeast.Jews in Spain and Portugal during the War, were not overly persecuted, because both regimes faced starvation and any Jew with relatives in the UK or US was pressed into service to lobby for agricultural exports in return for protection from deportation. Primo Levy in “Night” notes that if he had just stayed with his mother and sister in their Roman Apt., and not joined the Communist resistance, he would have like them rode out the war with their neighbors bringing food to them so they never had to leave.My point is two-fold. First, what the Jews experienced is not unique, but fairly common, and second our fate (inevitable at this point) as a discriminated, “Jewish” minority means the only way to escape the 1933-45 fate of Jews is to be useful for the new ascendant groups. In the EU/UK that will be Muslims, in the US likely blacks.

This sentence perfectly encapsulates why God wants us living in our own nations.  Who in god’s name appointed Iranian Jews to be the deciders of religious matters in Iran?  Just like American Jews oppose Christianity.  It’s self-serving BS which is very harmful to the native population.

        Why write about anti Semitism? It’s been around for at least 3500 years starting with ancient Egyptian, maybe earlier.
Maybe G-d keeps it to determine the next country to be destroyed: Egypt, Roman Empire, Russian Empire, USSR, now Ukraine and on and on.
The excuse for hating Jews is always found, be it poisoning the wells or causing mass migration.

            Beloved, maybe you’re always on the run because God is trying to catch you-
Except, God is kind of stupid, kind of slow, and you are as quick as a cat.By the time the steamroller arrives, the cat is already gone.Too late, sorry Egypt! Missed again, sorry ’bout that Rome!
After all, this is the big bozo you tricked into signing a Covenant with a sheep.

            In that case, how many times has “G-d” destroyed Israel? And why aren’t they concerned that they will be “the next country to be destroyed”.

            The genital mutilation of male children, even promoting such to people who are not Jews as being “healthy or safe and effective”, has to be high on the list of “excuses” I would think.

            “The excuse for hating Jews is always found, be it poisoning the wells or causing mass migration.”Anna, Jews seem to think they are special in the arena of persecution, but they are not.  Persecution of minorities is quite common around the world.  We are immeshed in Jewish angst because we in the West have close proximity to Jews who have (ironically) tended to thrive and reach influential levels, especially in the English speaking countries like the USA.  It does not take much searching to find horrific persecution of minorities elsewhere in the world.  For example recently, the Hutu’s and Tutsi’s In Rwanda.That you have a dog in this fight is understandable, but most of us do not.  For most of us, Jewish problems are nothing special or of import in our daily lives, albeit there are those who “for reasons” would wish it upon us.

            because empires and countries that don’t persecute jews last forever.
you might (but won’t) ask yourself why jews are so widely despised, and ejected from basically every place they settle.
