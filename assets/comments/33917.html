        I suspect that President Trump will be too busy chasing down antisemites to worry too much about good people like the Brimelows, his pardon of the J6 participants notwithstanding. In fact, I would be somewhat surprised if his Justice Department were to take meaningful action against AG Leticia James for doing the same to himself.

            You’re probably right. Trump should leave the anti-Israel protestors alone. They did nothing illegal. The US is a full accomplice to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. It’s a monstrous crime, compounded by political censorship at home. The Constitution, including the free speech, protects everyone here, not just US citizens.

                “The Constitution, including the free speech, protects everyone here, not just US citizens.”Let’s think that through to its implications. An armed invader, whether acting alone or with domestic help, is a criminal according to the so-called “supreme Law of the Land”, of which the great Con is a part. (Other parts are statutes and treaties. Neither of these are amendments to the Con, therefore the Con is not itself the supreme Law of the land, as our conservatards are fond of repeating to each other.)Now, is the invader entitled to protection under the 1st amendment when and after the Congress transmits to the president a demand that the invader be arrested and put into solitary confinement? The invader or his domestic allies will surely be preaching their agitprop to the other inhabitants of the land. Concerned for their own safety, the perps are keen to cripple legitimate inhabitants with some sob story or guilt trip. Congress has few sane people, but maybe, just maybe its members have been blackmailed into passing a private lay which requires gagging the mouths of the invader or the traitors who help him. Or the provision was slipped into a huge bill which the rubberstampers didn’t read.Next question: Are the president and the governors required to put the invader and his domestic allies on trial for his crime(s) before they order the armed forces to attack with their muskets and their bayonets?

                    Our legal protections don’t apply to armed invaders. In a war, we can kill the enemy for free, without penalty.However,Mahmoud Khalilhas a green card. He’s a legal resident. He’s not an armed invader or a terrorist. His only “crime” was to peacefully protest against Israel’s destruction of Gaza. Now, the US govt is using police-state tactics to round up people such as Khalil, throw them in jail, and later expel them. All without any warning, justification or due process.Khalil is innocent of any crime, just as were the J6 protestors. The US govt does this to please Israel, AIPAC and the Neocons – not for us. They putIsrael First, not us.

                        You are correct that MAGA is a stalking horse for Israel First, if that’s what you intended to imply about MAGA. Still, I think you’ve missed the point about your fashionable generalization. You wrote thatThe Constitution, including the free speech, protects everyone here, not just US citizens.If true, it would protect invaders, who needn’t be armed to count as such. A common purpose of invasion is occupation of territory and displacement of the inhabitants, as in the case of swarming immigration under way for more than a decade. Here we have the government itself bearing arms on behalf of immigrant invaders.So your generalization, while possibly correct in terms of what the Con entails, construes the Con as a suicide pact, as appears to be the case anyway. Since other passages of the Con suggest that it does not protect any and all invaders, you need to repudiate the absurd (but again, very fashionable) bs about it proctecting anyone and everyone on the USA’s territory under and all circumstances.As for Mahmoud, he’s not even half the innocent victim which you make him out to  be. At best he’s a leftist, a Muhammadist, or both. His small suffering has been earned, it’s btw that he’s a hypocritical resident alien, who needs to be humbled with duct tape over his mouth and around his hands until, at minimum, he’s ready to condemn Islam and socialism unconditionally as criminal. Let us have no more of your libernuttian caterwauling about supposed injustice against the unnecesaary alien hypocrite.

                            I agree that MAGA is a front for Israel, at the our expense.I dislike libertarianism, but I also oppose autocracy. I want a strong government, but within the law, with checks and balances, such as was advocated by Aristotle, Cicero and many others. I am against all non-White immigration. I am right-wing on social issues, and somewhat left-wing on economic issues and foreign policy.I support Israel, but oppose their genocide in Gaza. I oppose giving them any military or financial aid. They should have agreed to a cease-fire after the Hamas attack, and negotiated a hostage exchange. Instead, Netanyahu chose war and genocide, while the US (both parties) gave him a blank check.

                                “I support Israel”A-ha, more of the picture is coming into focus.“I oppose giving themany military or financial aid.”Wishy-washy, an unstable position. You are already, by your disposition, an easy mark for a sob story. “Oh, Talleyrand, six million Jews are threatened by Israel’s enemies,” one will say. “Have a heart. Put some money where your mouth is. Then we will send you a little pin to wear. We will even give you an extra one for your friend, John Derbyshire, to wear when you’re at the pub”“Netanyahu chosewar and genocide”Shocking, I say! Who could have predicted that that would happen in a state founded through Talleyrandist diplomacy and large servings of terrorism and massacre?It appears you’ve forgotten, or never learned, that the State of Israel was established with world government in mind.Atheist nazi Ben-Gurion, who held Isaiah in high esteem, made clear the ancient goal when he was still PM.“I also oppose autocracy”You don’t understand what you’re writing about.“I want a strong government, but within the law,”You’re a bootlicker who supports Israel. It’s easy to see how that must turn out.“with checks and balances, such as was advocated by Aristotle, Cicero and many others.”Your connivance reveals that you want a system based on lies, like those written by a dark council in “this Constitution” of no authority. Neither of those ancient scribblers prescribed or established stable systems.

                                “I want a strong government, but within the law,”How can you say truthfully that “I support Israel” yet allow the anti-Semites to preach their hatred to others? Israel remains at risk of failing to conquer the whole Earth so long as a single one enjoys the breath of life.“I am right-wing…, and somewhat left-wing…”You are muddleheaded, a slightly different variety of slow progressive but a conservatard nonetheless. But you are no Talleyrand, it seems. The T man would have sussed out problems with the preamble and Article VII without being prompted. The lame devil would likely, however, have kept his mouth shut.

        Seems like high time there was a little lawfare directed at LJ and her sidekick AB by the Trump admin. I can’t say the Trump admin is falling down completely in this department, in light of actions taken against leftist law firms who have been major lawfare players, but these two particular ripe targets seem oddly spared.

        I wonder if Derb, calling Kevin McDonald “the Marx of the antsemites” , thought he would be protected when he wrote “The Talk” back in 2012.  After he was canceled did he sit around saying “I am one of the good ones”?

                        The sarcasm was obvious, but I think that you misperceive the Z man’s swipes at the anti-Semites. He’s justtweaking humorless haters gently, to keep them from tumbling too far down into a dead-end hole of irrational hatred. Maybe he’s also tossing red herrings to fool the ghouls, including those who believe that it doesn’t matter thatthe Exodus is a myth.Perhaps John Derbyshire doesn’t mind big lies, but I say that it does matter if the Exodus story is a big lie. Let mythology alert us to the possibility also that the alleged national captivity by the Egyptians—an obvious sob story used to stir up Israel’s own people—is the most influential defamation in the history of the world.Shemotic defamation matters.I hope that you had a nice seder meal, and that you’ll have a good second one if your location calls for it. And may our host and every reader havea joyous pesachthis year!

That’s very 2025 of you. There were no “sob stories” back in the day; having been enslaved was a mark of shame, and Jewish tradition has always treated it as such.

Unfortunately, sarcasm can be difficult to communicate with written language and without knowing the commenter’s true opinions beforehand.  Believe me I’ve fucked up on this plenty of times thinking I’m being funny just to have someone I agree with giving me the business thinking I was serious.

        Al Stewart did a better song about the fall of Constantinople.Constantinople – YouTube1453 was also the year the Hundred Year’s War ended with a decisive French victory over the English at Castillon.  Although the English victories at Crécy, Agincourt and Poitiers are more memorable, at Castillon the French used massed field artillery to destroy the English army, forcing a withdrawal from Aquitaine.  England was left with only Calais on the continent, which I believe it lost during the reign of Mary Tudor.Other events marking the end of the Middle Ages were the victory of Henry VII over Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, the opening of regular communications between Old and New World by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation by Martin Luther in 1517.

                Why are you so harsh on Martin Luther?  I was raised as a Presbyterian, but lapsed into apostasy a long time ago.  And today I rather favor the positions taken by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churcheson the sources of Christian authority, although as a non-believer I feel I have no real stake in the outcome.  Nevertheless, the Roman Catholic Church in the late 15th and early 16th Century was really corrupt and Luther had every right to contest its practices.  His willingness to defend his position before Emperor Charles V at Worms (“here I stand, I can do no other”) speaks well for his courage and devotion to his beliefs.  He deserves better treatment at your hands.

                        Belittling or dismissing the Reformation in European history with a one-liner, joke or not; “harsh” or not (whatever these terms mean) — suggesting the whole thing an odd sort of antiquarian trivia, with no greater meaning — seems to me neither wise nor useful.

                    Corruption and other administrative failures were the focus of at best a third of Luther’s corpus, serving as a vehicle for the rest which was decidedly theological in nature. Some of his questions were reasonable enough to posit, others not so much. Rome considered and addressed them all, and while his doctrinal dissent had universally already been answered by existing teaching or functioned to finalize it, the temporal issues were taken quite seriously. Most had already been on the radar and the target of concerted eradication efforts for decades if not centuries, and they spent the next century working in earnest to correct them durably. This is unfortunately lost on many Catholics, Protestants, and secularists alike, who have each their own storybook versions of events in which the man is sainted or reviled, mostly for things that are at best grossly oversimplified or misrepresented. Indulgences and their sale are probably the most egregious example; indulgences (which are still granted today) are not a pass to heaven, their sale had already been considered a grave abuse since at least the 1200s, and characters like Tetzel marketing them as such (and marketing them at all) was a local practice in direct opposition to church teaching, not a central one in keeping with it.I was brought up Anglican, studied Lutheranism in my youth as a consequence of attending schools run by that church, and converted to Catholicism in my late 20s. As such I take a more sympathetic view of some of the reformers than my coreligionists. But while I retain some patience for Luther, I grant very little to Calvin, later Angloid expanisions on whose ideas contributed much more to long-term destabilization in Christendom than Luther or Henry ever did. While the continentals were eventually forced to find a way to coexist, if grudgingly, the English had descended into internecene Protestant-on-Protestant slaughter unseen anywhere else that persisted decades longer, and worse, crossed the Atlantic to spin off two further rematches with somewhat shuffled sides.

                Although the Gutenberg methods were achieved by the mid-1450s, as usual it took several decades to really make people “feel” it; to appreciate the potential of the new technology; for social-cultural adjustment to occur.For centuries it’s been widely commented on that the Reformation of the 1510s-1530s owed its success to Gutenberg. That both emanated from Germany no coincidence, but the argument is both cultural and technological.The alternative argument nominally fitting the facts: Gutenberg and the Reformation had NO connection to one another, BUT shared a common-cause — in the NW-European spirit of progress, freedom, liberty-of-thought, and technical tinkering; and dogged determination to find the truth, a relentlessly determined pursuit of knowledge; of free-endeavor, and, ultimately, greatness in the Western tradition.Gutenberg and the Reformation were both characteristically West-of-the-Hajnal-Line endeavors. That is valid but, to me, incomplete.There is much evidence that the mass distribution of pro-Protestant, anti-Catholic pamphlets, especially in the 1520s, was decisive in tipping the scales, whereas earlier reform movements had never quite broken through. If the 1517 event had occurred a few decades earlier, mass-printing technology and the social infrastructure for it would have been much weaker and failed (as many other medieval reform movements did).Mr Derb may think it no fun, or not suited to snappy, semi-ironic writing, but this “dating the End of the Middle Ages” game would have to rely on a decades-long transition period at least.(The other complication is the WHERE. We are implicitly talking ONLY about Europe, and really only about a few select regions of Europe’s northwest. In other regions, that which can be called the Middle Ages “ended” a lot later than this mid-15th-to-mid-16th-century window…)

                    Very much agreed that the timing of the Reformation was vital to its success. The precarious political situation on the continent in the XVI century might have been enough on its own without Gutenberg’s invention, but I’m not sure if events in Britain, especially in the XVII, would have taken the same course without intensive pamphleting. Americans often think of our struggle for independence, its ideas and methods as something novel but it was neither the first nor the last in a long series of internal conflicts rehashed at a shockingly detailed level.As far as the proper end date for the period, while much that was recognizeably medieval persisted for longer in places, with the Byzantines went the last most visible vestiges of antiquity.

                        If you peg the fall of the Byzantines to the end-date for the Medieval period, it should be specified this is the European Medieval period.Medieval(-like) institutions definitely survived outside Europe for centuries beyond that, still activein the 19th century all over the map(even if disrupted by European expansion), and shadows of the same lingering into the 20th century a bit.The marvel of the story of Meiji Japan is how one state dramatically transformed itself from a medieval-like status to a modern state so quickly and so relatively successfully. (But their success, even then, of course, was based on copying the Western model. It’s a lot harder to be first.)

        The game is to go to that atheism convention’s promotional website and find a photograph of a white person who isn’t visibly sexually perverse. (You lose.)Good corporate citizens, the atheists. Not as good as antifa, but…maybe. A test: Find someone weak enough for a sexless nerd to kill with a punch—maybe in a children’s hospice—and see if the police let you get away with it because you’re “with atheism.” If so,you’re in the army now.If not, gutting and de-intellectualizing the “movement” to suck up to the regime may not have been rational.

        Now I’m remembering an interview with Jerry Garcia about his beginnings in bluegrass. Bluegrass was pretty big up until the 70s. I think his comment was how limiting it was and he saw in the beginnings of rock much more potential for variety and musical exploration.  So he abandoned bluegrass.
Bela fleck, David grisman mark occinnor probably exhausted its limits. So I’m thinking this billy strings phenomenon is comfort music for whites in harrowing times.

There are tens of millions of such dupes now, and their birth rates are likely to be higher than that of Mao’s people.“only way to defeat Jewish peopleis total destruction and extinction of white people”Have I mentioned that Israel can makeNoahidedrones out of the dupes of many nations? Millions and millions will insist upon writing their ancestors into the mythical family tree of Israel.

Trump doesn’t understand basic Economics-101.His mega-tariffs areillegal. There is no “emergency”. He’s lying when he says there is. The President has no authority to levy taxes, including tariffs. Only Congress can do that. Only the House of Representatives can originate a tax-law. Then the Senate gets to vote on it, and finally the President can sign it. It’s right there in the Constitution. Taxes may not be imposed unilaterally by anautocrat.

            “But our side can’t use the power of the state, that would be ILLEGAL!”
I don’t know what to tell people like you anymore. Rule of law has been dead for 170 years and people are finally noticing and you’re sad about it. Being retarded must be difficult.

                OK, not “free trade”. But we need some trade. We gotta buy stuff and sell stuff worldwide. It benefits everyone. That’s Economics 101. We cannot simply tear up treaties unilaterally and arbitrarily. No one can do business with someone like that. Those kind of tactics might work in the NY real estate business, which is inherently corrupt. But not for honest businesses.Trump is going to tank the stock market, tank the economy, and worse of all, give the Democratic Party full control of Congress after the 2026 election – just like he did in 2017. Paul Ryan and the Neocons would like to see that again.

                    We do not need trade. North America has massive natural resources. Into the 20th century, we imported very little from the outside world relative to consumption. We may want to trade with other countries, but the reason must be the public good.
As far as the 2026 election, I do not care. The stupid party losing seats or gaining seats has never made a difference.

            “His mega-tariffs are illegal…The President has no authority to levy taxes, including tariffs. Only Congress can do that.”That’s a plausible assertion given what anyone can read in I.8.1, but there’s something which you refuse to understand about “this Constitution”. The people who imposed it never accepted its words at face value. They have always rejected the plain meaning of those words. They disregard also, as they see fit, both the assumptions which those words require and the logical relationships of the propositions asserted with those words in the document.Now look at A7. Just read it for once without the corrupting influence of your ancient, inborn devilry, Talleyrand. A7 pretends to be part of the “supreme Law of the Land” before its own ratification and establishment. So itcan’tbe a source of law on the topics indicated there. This law must come from outside the Con, but none of the Englightenment’s devils can explain truthfully what it could be.The illicit presumption of legality is authentically “self-evident”, but the clouds ignore this to get on with the exciting business of hoarding and using power. The words of Article I which have stirred you up simply do not matter to the people with the power until they choose to exploit those words as suits their desires. You are no different.

                    I think that you mean monocracy. Misuse of the word “autocracy” can be traced back to Aristotle, as I recall. The parts of the word indicate that it means self-rule, not one rules all. And fyi, if our borrowing from Greek had been less sloppy, we’d write aftocracy and say the word as suggested with the f.Now please address the more important points which I made about the Constitution of no authority, which helped to elevate Trump into power. People who’ve been turning a blind eye to that have no claim to moral high ground from which to shoot rocks and arrows at the effects.

            If there were any doubt about the legality of Trump’s tariffs, they’d have been overturned by now. There’s no shortage of judges willing–make that eager–to do so with the flimsiest of excuses.
