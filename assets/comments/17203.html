        I’ve been thinking about changing up my will.  I die in a car crash later today and it all goes to certain people who’ve treated me like crap my whole life.  Why not have the money go to entities on the Dissident Right who’ve been such a great thing in my life?  Those of us who have the ability to change our wills without incurring the wrath of wife or family should start thinking about who we’d REALLY like our money to go to.

            Now that there are some real costs to being me, I may have to bite the bullet and come up with a funding mechanism. I’m working on a book and that will cost money to get edited and published.
I’m a little unsure about how to move forward. Some people use services like Patreon or SubscribeStar, which could work for me. I think RamZPaul uses Patreon. I could probably crowd-source for a book project.
The trouble with these options is the people running them are unpredictable, emotional loons who can shut you down on a whim.

                Can you pull up a list of emails from the membership of this site? If so I would go with patreon, try to keep it low-key. A PO Box is pretty impervious to sjw shenanigans. But of course then you have to worry about the ricin

                I, for one, would strongly advise you to monetize. Yes by all means build up War chest. Going into the future you don’t know how many lawyers you’ll be required to pay. I hate those bastards but they can come in handy.

                    I’ll say one thing about top notch litigators, personally most are the sort of people I’d shoot if I found them on my front lawn uninvited.  But when shit hits the fan, a good one is invaluable.

                Ramzpaul does use patreon but like you said it is subject to their whims. I there is a way to do a crowdsourcing that wouldn’t immediately get shut down, that might be better.

                I don’t know about the legal framework of these things, but you could always crowd source incognito, tell them on the crowdsource site that you’re writing a book called “Schnauzer vs. Terrier: A History of Military Service Dogs in World War One.”  Then spread it around on this and other dissident sites that WW1 service dogs are, um, the /perfect/ subject for a book.  Like how sort of the best way to start an IRL dissident discussion club is to pool resources and open a storefront indie “art gallery” that has a LOT of ” invitation only” events.

But…that’s actually an interesting subject and if you don’t deliver you’re a douche. May as well have called Zman controlled opposition, a sni-i-itch on top of it.

                Many moons ago I decided to switch the money I was spending on the press: local paper, Economist, Foreign Affairs etc then = to about $600 a year to Web sources like James Corbett.  I did it 10 @ $5 a month. A mere pittance each but a couple of thousand like me and you’ll get by.In the past few years I’ve seen a bunch of $1 and up sites, my plan is, when I drop someone for a real or imagined sin (at my sole discretion of course) I’ll start the new guy @$10.Have to find a way to gradually increase the old and true,That’s a model that works for a little guy like me and works for the site as they’re not dependent on a couple of fickle sources, If they stray too far from the truth, they are, rightly, fucked.

                I agree that you can / should both monetize the website (there is a core number of us who will pay monthly without thinking one iota about it), AND go for the crowd-funding on the book.I LOVE Lester Fewer’s idea of giving the book a “Ghost Name” and crowd source it that way.Then, oops, if the title needs to change at the last minute (you know how editors are), so be it.Also love the idea of a PO box where some of us can send you some Benjamins without our friends at the intentional r*pe service knowing about it.Just me supporting you. No middle man.

                To paraphrase Chiang Kai-shek, Hillary Clinton is only a disease of the skin; McCain was a disease of the heart; a corrupt man despite his honorable parentage, elite schooling and all. It was a relief to me that he died; in our day that’s the only known remedy for eliminating miscreants from the governing power.
To think that decent Americans had no choice but to vote for this Quisling in 2008.
And here we are.

            McCain was intimately involved in the coup attempt against Trump. One of his lieutenants at the McCain Institute,David J Kramer,helped pimp the phony dossier. McCain was a DC Progressive to his core who lied repeatedly to his constituents to get re-elected.RIP,and good riddance.

            When Trump said he liked the ones who weren’t shot down, I knew he was my guy for two reasons (and I’m very much a pro-military vet): it proved he wasn’t susceptible to PC/cultural Marxism and, McCain was a rat bastard.

        Crowd funding for the Dissident Right is a real problem begging for a solution.  When I learned about Canada’s release of a “gay loonie” to commemmorate 50 years of decriminalizing sodomy, the fact that the mintage would be limited to C$3 million made me think that a few thousand radicals could buy them up and keep them out of public hands, maybe even sacrifice the funds to have the offending coins melted down.  Two immediate problems surfaced:  how not to be deplatformed from crowdfunding apps that would be SJW apoplectic and how to bureaucratically prevent or delay the Canadian mint from just  cranking out a few million more.  I certaintly couldn’t counsel defacement and recirculation of these abominations because that might be illegal.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/loonie-lgbtq-1.5107077
