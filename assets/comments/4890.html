        You don’t even need the weights.  Simple bodyweight exercises will do the trick.  Push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, deep knee bends.  If you can do 25 of each, you are in better shape than most 20-year olds.

            When you’re really old with spinal stenosis and arthritis, you can’t do the exercises you describe. At least I can’t. Hence, with the advice of the rehab people, I’ve taken on a regimen of loosening movements (I won’t even call them exercises) and resistance exercises – something pulling or pushing the other way when I pull or push. None of it is strenuous, although at 84 I’m a little tired when I finish.

            If you’re being serious, you can get weights as light as 1 lb. In a whole bunch of forms, strap-on being the most comfortable in my experience.
If you’re being sarcastic, I agree.

        An octogenarian with moderate spinal stenosis and an arthritic hip, the rehab people put me on a regimen consisting mostly of strap-on weights and elastic bands. They use some fairly fancy machines at their clinic, but they said the strap-on weights and bands at home do pretty much the same thing. Whatever I’m doing, I’m holding steady. So far.

            Weight training seems to have huge benefits to older men. The science is fuzzy, but the working theory is it kick starts hormonal response that counter act some of the effects of aging. It could all be psychological too. You feel better when you exercise. I know men in their 70’s who look 20 years younger and they swear it is the weight training.
