        My idiot stepson threw a donut at a cop. The cop was writing a ticket and was not amused. He called in his buddies to block off the streets so they could catch the evil doers. (and they were pissed off when they found out what the crime was.) Stepson was charged with interfering with an officer. If he’d hit the cop with the donut, it would have been felony assault.

        Maybe the cop would lighten up if a car full of girls waving rubber dickies tooled by him.

        I’m glad the cops popped this eighteen year old grown man with his arrested social development manifesting in a f–k you attitude toward me, my wife and my two young granddaugters.  No, I wasn’t there, but coulda been.In an earlier post you mentioned that once the elites lost respect for the laws and customs it was just a matter of time before the collapse.  It has not been customary for the public to accept this behaviour from men without so much as a rebuke, and if the officer stands as my proxy, well, fine with me.  Your disregard for the incident’s societal implications may stem from a belief that our customs have changed.  To me it seems like one more indication that our customs are simply no longer respected.

            Yes, if we let one guy wave his rubber dick around, in no time we will be up to our eyeballs in rubber dick waving anarchists. Seriously, I’m fine with a cop pulling the guy over if he was making a nuisance of himself. Give the driver a citation and a warning. Arresting the guy seems way over the top. I have this image of the jerk cop being a dick over the rubber dick. Sorry, I could not help myself.But, maybe there’s more to the story. Maybe when the cop pulled him over, the kid wanted to have a dick measuring contest. Sorry, sorry…
