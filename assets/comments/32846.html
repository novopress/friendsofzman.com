        As an occasional grammar notsee and one who delights in English literature, I take issue with your dismissal of spelling, punctuation, and word choice as mere late ‚Äòadornments‚Äô towards standardizing the language.  No, I could never diagram a sentence, but all those old fashioned ‚Äòrules‚Äô did and do serve a purpose ‚Äì clear and concise non-verbal communication.  Instead of having to explain and expound, proper grammar and correct use of homonyms clarifies thought and intention.  And I didn‚Äôt learn most of what I know in school ‚Äì I learned it from reading ‚Äì a lot.  I‚Äôm with PickleRick ‚Äì rein/reign, hoard/horde, marshall/martial ‚Äì these different spellings and meanings matter.  If one cares about western civilization‚Äôs cultural roots in Greece andRome, then one delights in English‚Äôs  higher-level Latinate vocabulary.  The sheer (not shear) word volume in English enables one to fine tune one‚Äôs tone and intent via the written word.

            Non-verbal? I think you are misusing the word. You seem to flirt with the concept of fine tuning tone, but, right before, you discuss clear thought.

                        Capital roughly means ‚Äúfirst rank‚Äù, capitol is the seat of power. For instance, the capital city houses the capitol. At least that‚Äôs how I was taught growing up.

            General agreement, but I believe there is a difference between those that mean well and those that just like to tut tut people for making errors and display their superior intellects.
In tribute to the latter, since we dooccasionallyget a few here that like to correct Z who is no stranger to grammatical errors, I must break out our favorite meme for this occasion. üòÅ

            John Derbyshire cited research which purportedly demonstrates that only 50% of students benefit from being in formal education beyond age 12 (equating to around six years of schooling), 20% beyond age 16, and 10% beyond age 18. In other words, education beyond the eighth grade(compulsory or otherwise)is not only a misallocation of resources, but a waste of time for the vast majority of students. Just another example of modern societies falling for theScarecrowfallacy.

                I already KNEW, by the time I was in 6th grade, that my teachers were all retards. Sorry, dumb as fuck, many sucking up to the popular kids. Pretty much was self-taught, used to read in class on my own all the time. Went to an ‚Äòelite‚Äô high school, so there‚Äôs that.
Had one teacher, King of sucking up to pretty girls ‚Ä¶ in middle school. Such a dipshit, when we moved during the school year simply did not mention it to him. He spent a few days asking about me‚Ä¶early ghosting act!

                There are 10s of millions of people walking around with a high school diploma or higher who posses a 6-8th grade education.Up until the 50s, the high school graduation rate was under 50%.Obviously, you have to account for the fact that some of these kids were forced out of school by economic circumstances.  But even allowing for socioeconomic factors, it‚Äôs probably not over 60% total for kids with real high school diplomas plus kids who could have gotten one if not for circumstance.  This was when the country was 85-90% White.Schools have pushing kids through for a long, long time, either by putting them in the dumb tract or just pushing them through based on age. However, back in the day, these people were largely kept out of safety critical professions.It really befuddles me that all these so-called professionals believe, or at least profess to believe that a 100% high school graduation rate (or close to it) is possible or even desirable.We now have doctors, engineers, airline pilots and other professions being loaded up with affirmative action graduates/employees who lack the underlying understanding needed to perform these jobs. God help us all.

                    You didn‚Äôt always need to go to school to go to work, also. Kind of makes sense, when you think about it. Learning on the job, apprenticeships. Vo-tech starts to look like the beginning of the effort to keep people in school earning credentials.
Best argument against is the old, well-rounded, liberal eduction‚Äî which most people don‚Äôt want and, I imagine, never cared about. I‚Äôm all for it, but it‚Äôs pissing in the wind.

            Many decades ago, when I attended a small all-male engineering-only college (of which there were only 4 majors), I was told on Day 1 that I was here to ‚Äúlearn how to learn.‚Äù And we were required to buy slide rules and taught that you must first estimate the magnitude of any answer in your head before operating the device. A third of my freshman class dropped out after the first trimester. We can‚Äôt fix our country until we return to this level of honesty and rigor in education.

                We can‚Äôt fix our country until we return to this level of honesty and rigor in education.Contemplate this:https://www.the74million.org/article/this-hartford-public-high-school-grad-cant-read-heres-how-it-happened/This Hartford Public High School Grad Can‚Äôt Read. Here‚Äôs How it HappenedDistrict officials acknowledged that in 12 years, Aleysha Ortiz never received reading instruction or intervention.When 19-year-old Aleysha Ortiz told Hartford City Council members in May that the public school system stole her education, she had to memorize her speech.Ortiz, who was a senior at Hartford Public High School at the time, wrote the speech using the talk-to-text function on her phone. She listened to it repeatedly to memorize it.That‚Äôs because she was never taught to read or write ‚Äî despite attending schools in Hartford since she was 6.Sounds bad. Then wrap your mind around this:Despite this, she received her diploma this spring after improving her grades in high school ‚Äî with help from the speech-to-text function ‚Äî and getting on the honor roll.She began her studies at the University of Connecticut this summer.Ortiz can‚Äôt read even most one-syllable words.The words she can read were memorized during karaoke or from subtitles at the bottom of TV screens and associating the words she saw with what she heard, she said.So someone who, quite literally, would be flummoxed by ‚ÄúDick and Jane‚Äù kindergarten readers, orOne Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fishis a college student.

                    As a baseball statistics fanatic when I was ten (1970-71) I played a lot of table baseball games and kept meticulous, updated stats on every team and player. No calculators then, not for kids anyway (those that existed were expensive business tools). But dad showed me how to use a slide-rule to multiply and divide. I knew nothing of logarithms, but I knew how to use the slide ruleto calculate batting averages and ERA,which was what I cared about.Anyone who went through public school in the seventies will recall those old textbooks that included several pages filled with log tables. After I understood why it worked, I brought my slide rule to class and skipped the printed tables by using it instead. None of the other students had ever seen a slide rule, let alone knew how to use one. Then here I was (no great shakes in math, aside from my obsession with numbers) producing answers to questions almost instantly as the rest of the class fumbled through their log tables. Soon enough a student claimed I was cheating, and in hindsight she was correct; I was using a mechanical device to find a correct answer just as if I were punching numbers into a pocket calculator.The difference being that I understood how it worked, and our teacher let me continue using it in class (though the rules prohibited its use on exams).I suppose that nowadays a slide rule is as mysterious as an astrolabe. I looked for one a few times back in the nineties when I was a math teacher myself, but had no luck.

            Shades of Little House on the Prairie, Laura in 8th grade could do long division in her head, parse/diagram a long sentence, and recite history from memory, and manage unruly other schoolchildren when she herself was little more than a child. I could teach someone to read and write in less than a week. These are absolutely critical skills. How do you know if you are being cheated if you can‚Äôt even calculate APR or ROI?

                        The problem here might be that a typical commenter knows the difference among these three concepts/definitions, but spells them incorrectly given use. I do such all the time with their and there. I type quickly‚Äîand quite regularly, out pops ‚Äútheir‚Äù when overwhelmingly, I want ‚Äúthere‚Äù.
I think such a problem is fundamentally different than many who use ‚Äúyour‚Äù for ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù (you are).

                                This is precisely why we‚Äôd be better off avoiding the grammar Nazi stuff.  The only use I can see for it here is to clarify potential misinterpretation of an idea posted.  But when we all know what the point is of the commentator, then let it pass.  It‚Äôs the idea that counts more than the expression.

            The one that drives me nuts everytime it hear it is the use of the word ‚Äúless‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfewer‚Äù. It raises my blood pressure to hear someone talking of ‚Äúless people‚Äù or ‚Äúless cars‚Äù. What makes it sad is that I think the loss of the word ‚Äúfewer‚Äù isn‚Äôt due to some natural change in the way people speak. The word‚Äôs been lost because the majority of people today are simply ignorant of and/or incapable of understanding the difference between the discrete and continuous.

                That‚Äôs a good and doubtlessverbotenpoint. The plague of poor grammar, word choice, syntax, etc. is not primarily a function of language‚Äôs evolution; it is the result of general cognitive decline. The abandonment of prescriptive lexicography is, more than anything, just another aspect of dumbing down on behalf of the dusky.

                    Yep, which is why the distinction between ‚Äúwho‚Äù and ‚Äúwhom‚Äù is dead. Indeed, I believe I read a while back that such questions involving their use were removed from standardized testing as unable to distinguish between high scoring and low scoring students, i.e., ‚Äúitem discrimination‚Äù.

            This is why we need segregation.  With White kids making up less than 1/2 of all kids in the US, they are sharing classrooms with all the diverse kids.  This is one of the ways the mean really matters.  I had to read books cover to cover starting around 2nd or 3rd grade.
But the standards have collapsed.  We now have millions of adults possessing a high school diploma with a 6th or 7th grade education.  Many of them have a degree.

            ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure everyone here saw the stories making the rounds that high school kids go to college and have never read a whole book.‚ÄùTell me about it. As an undergraduate, I was recommended for the university ‚ÄúHonors Society‚Äù. In those days, you first had a prof formally recommend you, then had to be interviewed by three other faculty members for admission. So there I sat in an office talking to 3 prof‚Äôs I‚Äôd never met before. Folks, this was *not* Ivy League‚Äîit was a GD State university. Since then we‚Äôve descended into almost total darkness.So what did we have to talk about in common, nothing‚Äîexcept classics (talking books here) that you were expected to be familiar with. I was simply a Sophomore and knew nothing at the time, but was always pretty fast on my feet, so I switched the book inquiries to those I *had* read. They accepted Shakespearean plays as well. I thought we got along fine. I was admitted, but then had to have another damn interview‚Äîan ‚Äúafter action report‚Äù (feedback) if you will. Basically, I was told I was poorly ‚Äúread‚Äù and to step up my game if I expected to succeed at this university.Tell me where you‚Äôve heard of this recently?

        Of course proper grammar is going away the same as cursive writing has all but been eliminated because they both have their roots in W Civ and as we all know, WC is racist and must be dismantled.  And as for my pen and notepad, you can pry those from my cold, dead fingers.

            I think cursive is dead/dying because of cell phone texting and e-mail. What you‚Äôve no need for, you forget. What you forget is therefore a waste of time and resources to learn. Here in this State the legislature got together (IIR) to mandate it continue in k-12, but that seems a losing battle. Older teachers may decry such a loss, but the reality is that the ‚Äúchicken-scratch‚Äù turned in by students is difficult to read, much less grade. Before I retired, most everything written was in digital form‚Äîif not for the ease of reading, then to upload such student submission to firms that examined/scored the essays for plagiarism. I played with such to some success even submitting computer program code.

            Same.  One of the most interesting classes I took towards my first incomplete MA was in Paleography, which I found I had an affinity for.  Cannot remember it now, but I got quite good at reading Elizabethan cursive.  Stood me in good stead when I began doing genealogy, and I had to first decipher and then translate 18th and 19th century Italian cursive.  So much of western history will be lost to the digital generations who never learned cursive.  Note:   My own cursive is atrocious, but I still admire an elegant hand.

        On the internet, the NPC is already indistinguishable from the bot. Nor is it always clear which is mimicking which. Which begs the legitimate question of which came first. Since an NPC (is a or an proper there?) by definition can‚Äôt have original thoughts, but the NPC existed before the bot, I think. He was made an NPC by something else besides the bot. The older ones, anyway. Younger NPCs may be more bot inspired.As I have posted before, I regularly read posts on reddit, it probably rots my brain, but anyway, I commonly see posters explicitly asking ‚Äúwhat is our opinion about this?‚Äù when some new story drops. So it is possible that their opinions, so sought, are directly supplied to them by bots answering that question. They don‚Äôt have to be subtly manipulated over time, they eagerly, willingly seek direction in exactly that fashion. It‚Äôs at least efficient. Although I cannot say with 100% certainty whether or not it was a bot asking that question in the first place, and thus normalizing such behavior for the NPCs to emulate.

                This is a good instinct to have, it‚Äôs just aimed in the wrong direction.
We don‚Äôt have to have an opinion on every subject.  Often, we just don‚Äôt know enough or want to dedicate the time to really have an opinion on something.
But instead of seeking your opinion by what others think, if you‚Äôre that interested in having an opinion on the topic, seek more information, or think longer about it.
Outsourcing your opinion like that is a great way to be controlled by others.
Sadly, in a democracy, everyone has to have an opinion on every freakin‚Äô topic.

        My personal mission over the years has been to retain the distinction between the verb ‚Äúled‚Äù and the noun ‚Äúlead.‚Äù Confusion of the two here, for instance, draws a blue line underneath the misused word, yet my personal mission has failed and ‚Äúled‚Äù as a verb has all but disappeared despite all the forceful technological advances to preserve the distinction.Globohomo strives for conformity, so attempts to make language dully uniform are to be expected. The next step will be attempts to eliminate all different languages from the face of the Earth and to impose one uniform but African-friendly version of what was quaintly known as ‚ÄúEnglish.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think Globohomo wins in the end, though (maybe that opinion will be forcibly changed if technology progresses enough to detect and change internal BadThought).  After all, imposing standards and eliminating indigenous language is racist and all.

        Since we think in language, I wonder if AI could be used to help people think/reason more clearly?   If it can be used to eliminate Bad Think, perhaps it could help people think better.  Nah. It‚Äôd be sued into bankruptcy by the DOJ for disparate impact.

            Not really. People who use AI do it almost entirely passively. It‚Äôs just uploading one program for another, even if it is a program that helps our side.
The paradox of AI is the smarter you are, the less enlightening it is. It gives an efficiency boost, but outside of things like learning a foreign language, most can easily learn faster using earlier methods, like reading a book.

        There are now videos on the internet of people using ChatGPT to conduct self psychoanalysis. The LLM plays the role of the psychologist and people unburden themselves of their darkest secrets, fears, and dysfunctions; and then have lively interactions with a bot parroting advice found in women‚Äôs magazines. Undoubtedly, there are AIs studying these psychoanalytical sessions and harvesting your data for future sales and use by others. What does it mean to be human anymore when all of life is technocratic?

            There‚Äôs also a bunch of perverts using local LLMs to write what is presumably very dodgy fiction.

        The sensitivity and inclusivity features of grammar apps are the first things I turn off. Used properly, grammar apps are incredible in giving you a view into words that you are overusing, filler phrases that add nothing, and singular/plural mismatches.The thing with LLM‚Äôs is they all have the same stale, irritating cadence. Even with some prompt engineering it‚Äôs hard to get rid of. They are also, paradoxically, largely information devoid because of the heavy pressure to avoid bad-think conclusions.Corporations already had such weird, stodgy rules that internal documents were already a running joke, and AI is going to make it worse. This means that 30% of your workforce will be consumed into vapid AI-speak of their tools, which will just make it easier to see who‚Äôs not a zombie.

        I dunno, Z.old internet behaviour patterns might bode well for today. I remember the old message boards in the late 90‚Äôs ‚Äì when they began to moderate them to appease the liberal faggotry ‚Äì the normies all left and set up boards elsewhere. Left to themselves, the old message boards died. Gab is a product oh the phenomenon. Perhaps your site here is too?People misunderstand the free speech issue: there will ALWAYS be free speech. Even at the height of the Nazi regime in Germany, people were getting shot and sent to the camps for saying the wrong things.

        I once read that a lot of the strange English grammar rules came about because the people who formulated them back when modern English was developing used Latin as a template for the rules. Latin and English are quite different and the square peg of English never quite fit in the round hole of Latin.

            I had a Dutch born/educated faculty member in the German dept at my university.  Although young, he received his formal education in the Netherlands and was fluent in the dead languages of Greek and Latin.  Although my memory fades of the man, what I remember is that he could, and did, explain most all those odd quirks in English language grammar, and particularly spelling, that stemmed from inclusion of/origin from those dead languages and words.  For 12 years of grade school and high school my teachers had always shrugged, when questioned on such ‚Äúoddities‚Äù, with the blow off‚Äî ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way it is‚Äù.   üòâ

        While grammar nazis are irritating, poor grammar sometimes signals a dumb person pretending to be smart or promoted beyond their abilities.
On Jared‚Äôs website, a man who fled the east coast for Idaho recalls that the final straw for him was when his son‚Äôs black teacher said, ‚ÄúWas you looking for Miss Briggs?‚Äùhttps://www.amren.com/commentary/2024/10/leaving-home/
A recent example that grated on me was some guy on youtube trying to present himself as wise whose channel name was ‚ÄúThinking Critical.‚Äù  While I acknowledge that it is possible to wise and not understand how adverbs work, it‚Äôs not a good first impression.

        Some reading for those interested:Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy.Fischer, et al., ‚ÄúSearching the Explanations: How the Internet Inflates‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe impact of tech on the current era cannot be overstated. The shift from a primarily oral to literate culture in England(Manuscript era) still preserved the thought process of oral; this accounted for the popularity of frame narrative during the time (e.g. The Canterbury Tales) as a means to mimic oral patterns in text. The shift to a new way of thinking was gradual. And it was a new way of thinkingThe primary experience of oral knowledge transmission is a group catching the big points of an oral speaker and leaving with a communal, homogenous interpretation. Think of the classic image: A scop telling the history of his people, and all the people leaving with the chunks of meaning.Contrast with literacy: The classic image, a single person with a personal, isolated interpretation, contrasted against every other person reading the same material. The method of transmission fundamentally alters how we experience the information being transmitted.At least with books, a person either knows the material or realizes they do not know, for the repository of information is so clearly external. A person either knows they know the meaning of a word, or they recognize they do not. And, recognizing they do not, they know it is stored elsewhere.Now, consider tech: People are so intimate with tech, and the material is so closely linked to them, that they now conflate what they know with what they can access. Truly scary times.As an aside, I sometimes play the grammar Nazi, but only to troll. Much like when someone flips you the bird and you smile and wave back, refusing to get in the trenches with them and just making flippant observations drives them nuts.Otherwise, I could care less (sic ‚Äì I know it is couldn‚Äôt).

        There‚Äôs a saying in movie script writing that says, ‚ÄúNever try to write dialogue for characters who are smarter than you.‚ÄùThe reason for this advice is your character will come off as stilted and wooden, because a stupid person is trying to sound smart.  It‚Äôs obvious and takes viewers out of the film.  (Similar to how execs demand woke concepts be ham fistedly inserted into the script‚Ä¶your brain just groans from the cringe.)The AI machines will not make stupid people smarter relative to everyone else.   Stupid people speaking into an AI word generator will still appear to be stupid relative to smart people using the same AI machine.Thanks to YouTube I can fix all manner of things myself these days.  But I would never be mistaken for an electrician or mechanic.  Those trades have access to the same information, and can focus their attention on more complex repairs I would never try‚Ä¶using YouTube.Relative to the electrician, I have gained nothing.

        I‚Äôve mentioned that a friend of mine got in trouble at work for writing a corporate message without using ‚ÄúAI.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt keep up with trends, so she didn‚Äôt know that speaking without automated constraint is considered a shocking violation of business etiquette. Primitive chatbots are already embraced as meta-corporateinfalliblejudgment machines.Out here in normal life they‚Äôre something like the opposite. The last glow-lefty attack on /pol/, the one that finally got it right and destroyed the place, was accomplished primarily via infiltration‚Äîbut the public face of it was peoplepretending to be bots. The unreadability of 4chan is the work of the mechanical pajeet. What are the x millionhigh IQIndian tech workers we‚Äôve imported doing here, exactly? Thousands of them are BBC-posting in the ‚Äúwithout sounding angry‚Äù threads they made.(Manfulness- and daring-themed memes built on Indian male insecurity are a big hit with a certaintendencyof our guys. For example, one reason Patriot Front are suspected of being a fed op is because unlike actual rightists, who are a nearly random selection of men, the Front parade for the press in costume-department-issue TV-movie neonazi dress. The ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, they must be feds because we all know real patriots are fat and look like shit‚Äù defense was brought to you by Vivek Polshitter. You may think you thought of it yourself, but you didn‚Äôt.)Chatbots cultivate universal distrust, because their potential for disruption is limitless. JIDF, ActBlue, etc., are just guys in rooms. There are more of us. Even on a field tilted in their favor, as old /pol/ was, we win decisively. But we can be (have been) infinitely outnumbered by ChatGPT instances‚Äîor Indians pretending to be them.

        It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve used ‚ÄúMS Word‚Äù in any substantive way, the department being a Unix house initially with faculty and staff using those tools before there was even MS Word availability.

This is a very astute insight made today by Z-man.I fully admit to poor grammar as I was taught by well meaning nuns in Parochial school and apologize to them unashamedly‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not going to change.  A famous poet known for writing without capitalization was E. E. Cummings. He is celebrated for his unconventional style, which included irregular punctuation, capitalization, and spacing.¬†If this guy can become famous for ‚Äútossing out the book‚Äù, then who am I to object?   üôÇ

        Language is constantly evolving. New words appear in the dictionary all the time and old words drop out of usage.Modern languages ‚Äúfroze‚Äù about the year 1750. It‚Äôs difficult to read Shakespeare because he was writing 150 years before. On the other hand, a Stephen King book from the 1970s will still be readable in 3000, if English is still being used.To capture a language at a point in time is to imprison a butterfly. ü¶ã It is a fragile thing. Perhaps in the future, with technology, we‚Äôll have telepathy and raw idea-concepts will replace the building block words of language ‚Ä¶‚Äî Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            Shakespeare‚Äôs stuff is difficult to read because it was written to be witnessed as live plays, not strictly read. It‚Äôs like reading a movie script, where you have the additional arbitrary layer of translating it in your imagination.
