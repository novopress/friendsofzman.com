        I was of an age ‚Äî probably among the last cohort of such an age ‚Äî raised with unabashed patriotism. As a child I was taught to admire the Pilgrims and other early settlers. My school lessons were infused with unabashed patriotism. We sang patriotic songs in choir and music class. As a break from lessons, we were screened films like1776andJohnny Tremaine.These were ordinary public schools across the country (we moved a lot).The idea that settlers would have been portrayed as cruel and genocidal would have shocked me. It‚Äôs not as if we never read anything negative about early America, but we were given to understand the negative in context with the positive and that our ancestors had bequeathed us a remarkable thing.That was part of my identity. In ‚Äô79 and ‚Äô80 my high school German class went on trips to Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The place felt like home. I was awed by the castle, cathedrals, art and architecture and by the land and the nature of the people themselves. It was an incredibly high-trust place back then. In Munich you were expected to buy a subway ticket, but there were no turnstiles or ticket-takers. It was almost entirely on the honor system. There were just rare random spot checks. That was all they needed in that time and place.We need to find a way to pass that reverence for Western Civilization on.My school years were very late ‚Äô60s through early ‚Äô80s. The speed with with that patriotism has been destroyed in the next generations is shocking.

            December 2020 is the 400-year anniversary of the Pilgrims landing in Plymouth.  Are any kids in school learning and celebrating one of milestones in American history?

                Probably the only thing being taught about the Pilgrims in school these days is the Malcolm X quote ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt land on Plymouth Rock. Plymouth Rock landed on us‚Äù.

                    What an odd thing to say given that the first and last slave owners on the North American continent were the Native Americans who took slaves through raids and conquest. Chattel slavery was introduced by the Spanish in what is now FL, and by the French in the Louisiana Territory.

                    JFK is a little White to commemorate these days. Blacks like to pretend the civil rights era happened in spite of Whites, not because of them. Also Kennedy was pretty nationalistic, patriotic and a tax cutter. He‚Äôs inconvenient.

                Actually, I‚Äôve seen such. But now the narrative is not what it used to be, but rather how the Native American Indians taught the Pilgrims how to survive and thrive in the New World and as their reward were driven from *their* lands by the greedy Pilgrims.
Not sure that this is better than saying nothing.

            In 1972 I remember in third grade our (literally) ‚Äúold school‚Äù teacher have our class say the Lord‚Äôs Prayer every morning which was probably in violation of Federal law even then. No one thought twice about it though because it was just part of the common culture that all the kids shared at the time.

                Carters creation of the Department of Education (1979?) and its subsequent actions marked the point at which the Federal Government was sufficiently involved in education in the several States for the First Amendment to be applied (even at a stretch) to the schools. As has been remarked here before, the States often had explicit official links to their preferred churches. The small hat wearers were far less of a problem before the decades of GOP ascendancy.- Remember it was Saint Ronny who shipped in all the Soviet Jews..

            Vizzini, I am of a similar age (school from 1963-1980) and I remember, even in my extraordinarily ‚Äòliberal‚Äô school district, gustily singing the various armed-forces songs in first grade class.  Our music teacher was more mushy (and her name matched) but there was never a hint of questioning the civic religion or founding myths.

                Oh, yes. I can still sing a few bars of each of the armed force branch theme songs! I learned them in school and things like the Battle Hymn of the Republic as a normal American kid upbringing.

            I would suspect the speed with which patriotism has been destroyed is directly proportional to the increase of non Whites in America‚Äînot to demean any minority wrt patriotism, but when great numbers of new ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù come on board with no background in such American national fundamentals, you get this.

            Sounds like I‚Äôm a few years younger than you, and I can fully corroborate your experiences. The place we now live in bears precious little resemblance to the one in which we grew up. Needless to say, virtually all of the change that has taken place has been deterioration.

        One gets the sense that the establishment is a little worried about what they have done.Tangentially, is anyone talking about a possible end to this covid nonsense this next year? For me, that‚Äôs been the worst part ‚Äì no one seems interested in finally giving some hope to getting back on the road. I had three great-grandchildren born this year past fall and I couldn‚Äôt get out to see them. Well, I could, but the cost and hassle of traveling from overseas is, I hate to say it, not worth it. What do you do? Every time I see someone trying to justify these half-assed wartime conditions they‚Äôre always morons without kids. Or gay. Or some LGBT whack-a-doodle. Seeing your adult kids over Facetime or Skype is one thing, but seeing your newest addition held up to a camera‚Ä¶not the same as seeing with your own eyes. And I hate the people who try to tell me otherwise, that I have to grin and bare it, because we‚Äôre all in this together. I don‚Äôt want to hate these people, I don‚Äôt even know them, I just want them to f*ck off.

For me, I chose peaceful non-compliance with the illegal edicts of tyrants over¬†the Thanksgiving¬†holiday.

At this¬†point, most¬†of¬†the illegal edicts are wholly unenforceable if one uses secondary¬†and tertiary roads.

            ‚Äúthe fun part- is when we realize how dumb are the morons we wuz had by.‚ÄùOh we are finding out now! All it took to win Georgia was 4 suitcases of fake votes, scanned by four people in the middle of the night in 2.5 hours! Something, something, burst pipe, everyone go home, print necessary votes when everyone is gone. Lack of pushback from GA officials (who are mostly still republican) is insane. I don‚Äôt believe that they are this stupid. What kind of deal got done to for the republicans to not try to squash this sooner?Check the video:https://twitter.com/news_ntd/status/1334585268347817984This operations looks about as complex as a making a few copies at kinkos or filling up a tank of gas.

                My guess is that the Republican governor is neck deep is some fraud himself and is afraid of it coming out. All this was set up by a consent decree that settled a lawsuit brought by the execrable Abrams.  Odds are they uncovered something during that lawsuit and the governor is selling his state down the river to keep it covered up.

        The football girl reminds me of radio school in the Marines.  Back when I joined in the 80s, Boot Camp was completely separated by sex and all the men went to the MCT which was a physically brutal short infantry course.  The guys with Infantry jobs stayed on for the full infantry course while everyone else went to the their tech schools.I went to radio school where there were some women.  We were supposed to believe that they were our equals.  But they literally couldn‚Äôt carry their gear up the steps of the barracks in one trip ‚Äì the same gear I had been carrying 20 to 40 miles at a time at MCT.  And every time we had company physical training, all the chicks dropped out of the run about halfway.

        Noticed that Fuckerberg has a new anti white policy for Facebook.In the meantime we have GOP Senator Mile Lee openly passing foreign labor laws for Google.The GOP and big tech are equally worthless.But until white people wake up to what is happening to them they will continue to be ruled by Morons.

            ‚ÄúCourage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.‚Äù ‚Äì CS LewisAnd here are productive and even enviro-conscious farmers in the heartland, red state, providing for themselves by feeding their community and yet they are openly attacked by cretins, pressed into defending their natural rights while their oppressors walk free.Without courage in the heart of every man, a community is nothing but opportunistic commerce; men without chests, in perpetual prostration to dark forces, begging for permission to transact for his own bread.These black hooded monsters are the future. All of us will be tested.The community we need is one of spiritual fortitude in the face of the devils agents, the bricks and sticks are nothing without this. Red zip code safety is a mirage; safety is earned by confronting the elements and bringing them to heel, not by hiding among like numbers.

                I applaud them for staying in place and fighting back, as much as they are able.  The reality for them is that they have been singled out and will never win or find any peace.  Their opponents are too strong, too well organized, too well funded, and too fanatical.  The farmers can either stay in place and serve as martyrs, soaking up enemy attention and resources as they fight their battle, or they can drop out, move, and start over in a new place with essentially new identities.  Either way, they are one of us and are on our side, and deserve our full support.  This stuff is not easy, and once Sauron‚Äôs Eye focuses on you, there are no good or easy choices.

                    As do I. Yet the fact that any of us can be ‚Äì and likely will be, ‚Äúsingled out‚Äù is the very problem. Singled out from what?Singled out because the black mobs know there is no herd, no stampede awaiting them if they encircle a calf.The farmers are not picketing abortion clinics in SFO. They are serving their community.So where is that community now? Where are their neighbors? Their fellow farmers and vendors? All the (R) voting, AR-lubing, church-going community members that populate the red?They are left begging to finance a schlomo debate club at the State courthouse. Which still wont remedy the underlying problem.I am just so sick of weak men. Martyrs are wasted on them.In fact its their weakness that creates these martyrs. They greedily graze upon the green grass tended by their clan but when the hyenas pluck one of their own from their midst they respond ‚Äúwell they shouldn‚Äôt have left the paddock like that.‚ÄùI am a flawed and fallen man. Plenty of weakness marks the path behind me ‚Äì and haunts my idle hours to this day. Luckily my brothers here and elsewhere keep me in their trust and so I work to earn my keep.Racist/Nazi is the twine around the elephants leg. The chains of its youth long gone, but for a another handful of peanuts it will forget its own mass and strength.We must remember who we are and from whence we came.The only rainbow flags I want to see are what happens when 88 tons lands on a clown.We are many. If they single us out; they shall know our mass.okay, long post friday over!

                    Exactly. The red-state comfy blankie is rapidly becoming just that. So then what?The vetting of geography for moves toward separation, away from hostiles, toward ‚Äúour guys‚Äù is only part of it.We need to find and vet brothers, test each other, hold to account for weakness, and reward tested strength and courage with mutual investment; iron sharpens iron.Because none of us are exempt from the original sin of whiteness nor the many temptations toward weakness that our enemies will force upon us.And the laurels of colored maps should give us about as much comfort as the ‚Äúvotes‚Äù that generate them.This, a brotherhood of wolves among the sheeple, is our frontier to cut out of the zombie nation.

                        Even in my Idaho town that voted nearly 70% for Trump the Karen mayor and the Kens and Karens on the city council have been ratcheting up the Covid restrictions for months ‚Äì canceling a 4th of July celebration that annually draws 10‚Äôs of thousands, a rodeo that has taken place every August for the past 108 years, the high school homecoming parade etc. This past week they upped the ante by criminalizing unauthorized gatherings with penalties that potentially include jail time. Of course the local police chief was interviewed and seemed absolutely giddy at the chance to bully and abuse normal law abiding citizens.

You may not know them, and you may only pass them by, walking down the street (remember when we all used to be allowed to walk down the street?).  But there is ‚Äúthe look‚Äù, and the ‚Äútwinkle in the eye‚Äù.  Lots of Brothers and Sisters out there.

            The coup that is underway is a blatant, in-your-face, we don‚Äôt care if you know exactly what we‚Äôre doing, cock walk of a insult to the plebs. They want to rub our noses in it and show everyone who‚Äôs boss. It is the power move of a tyrannical regime that has pushed all the chips into the pot and is now openly and arrogantly playing for keeps. Things change slowly until they change very fast. The rule of law is dead. Societal trust is dead. The spring is winding tighter every day. Just as they planned all along.

                They simply spun the web of lies and deceit until the scales fell from everyone‚Äôs eyes.  Now comes the hammer, in which they throw their weight around and don‚Äôt care who sees what.  Doubling down on every fake thing, accompanied by extreme violence on anyone singled out.  A dangerous and interesting historical moment, for sure.

                    Agreed. We are about the enter our Year of Living Dangerously. The first overt act of resistance (by anyone other than the Left) will be labeled as a tsunami of white supremacist extremism and get the WACO/Ruby Ridge treatment. The Feds are chomping at the bit to unleash Holy Hell upon whatever sad sack gets in their cross-hairs. Don‚Äôt become an easy target. There is a better way to fight back. It works, they know it, and have nothing in their arsenal to stop it. The idea is to actually defeat tyranny, not die bravely and vainly.

                            Courage is both a virtue and an asset, and we both hold it in high regard. Nothing I‚Äôve written implies otherwise. The Deep State is well prepared to smash a conventional rebellion, so a better paradigm is needed. The Feds burned children alive at Waco and rifle shot an unarmed mother holding her child at Ruby Ridge. That is what we are up against. You have to take this seriously. It‚Äôs not a macho contest.

                    Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. That is exactly their plan. And if they cannot entice someone into the trap via covert instigators (like they did in Michigan earlier this Fall), they will manufacture a false flag OP and pin it on some sap. As soon as the wheels come off, they will be seriously ginning up a diversion and scapegoat. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they had Hollywood screenwriters working on this right now.

                The nonsense about fighting to hold the Senate for the Republicans is a smoke screen designed to distract people from the emergence of a real tyranny here in the US. It‚Äôs secondary purpose is to create false hope on Mainstreet USA as a mitigation for the growing anger over the coup. Presumably, this illusion of false hope will keep the pitchforks at bay and abate the need for the Jackboots to reveal themselves too early. The new Covidian religion will provide the Jackboots with the moral authority to begin the crackdown after the inauguration.

        Where I live you can see deep concern on the faces of progressives. They have lost that perkiness they had only a week or so ago. Our side seems calmer, though smoldering with an inner rage that can‚Äôt wait to leap out. This is going to get interesting in a hurry.

            I‚Äôve seen it too, Epaminondas. I spose many progressives who should be happy, for example, with the presidential ‚Äúelection‚Äù results are thinking ‚Äúwhat the hell have we done?‚Äù Things seem to be going their way these days and it should be their time to really shine, but their uneasiness is all too evident. There is a sort of quietness on the right that even Lefty knows, or at least suspects, is not to be confused with resignation.

        Speaking of National Review, the editors wrote an editorial celebrating their 65th anniversary by declaring victory over the left.  It starts off with the following:This¬†magazine was founded 65 years ago to protest ‚Äî no, to overthrow ‚Äî a stultifying liberal consensus that viewed history as a train and itself as the destination. The universities, the newspapers and the networks, the Democratic Party and much of the Republican Party were united in believing that centralized rule by benevolent experts was our inevitable fate.We won.Satire is truly dead.  After some bragging about defeating the Soviet Union, they admit this hasn‚Äôt been a total victory for them.  They still have work to do.  As long as their are dissident thinkers on the right, they will work tirelessly to purge them, or at least as long as the left lets them do that.  To take the Schooner Creek Farm family as an example, do they think that would have happened in 1955?https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/heres-to-65-years-of-shattering-the-liberal-consensus/

                    Between this bizarre claim of victory and the lack of a year end begathon, I wonder if they picked up some low key corporate funding.  The fundraiser they ran in October was a disaster for them, it is currently listed on their website as $8,718 in donations and they had a $250k goal when they started.  Their geriatric readers appear to finally be realizing they have been giving their money to the political equivalent of TV evangelists.  The only reason I can think of for them to be this smug is that they don‚Äôt need the donations anymore.

            It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the suffering of Conservative Inc and the GOP right now.It has been glorious. Even the sequencing has been glorious:Trump contests the massive voter fraud operation. Conservative, Inc., would love to hammer him but‚Ä¶The same fraud machine has led to a run-off in the Georgia Senate race that will determine which grifters control the body. Trump‚Äôs GOP critics have to be somewhat muted.As soon as the ink dries on their election certifications, Graham and Cornyn begin to tout a massive new amnesty.Lee rams through a mass expansion of green cards for Pajeet tech workers.The rubes notice.I have been told, and trust the person since I‚Äôve known him to be reliable and honest for four decades, the Republicans are not getting donations to fund the Georgia Senate run-off. This is particularly true among those who donated to Trump although even more traditional types are withholding funds.Destruction of the GOP is the first step toward liberation from the State. It appears well underway. This is the end of the beginning.

            National Review has been irrelevant for about two decades now, so satire is the next logical and final stage. It is as ludicrous as the blue-haired heiresses who fund it and Constitution-clutching nostalgists who read it. It would be hard to think of an ideology that failed as spectacularly, and that would include Marxism, than Buckleyite conservatism.

                Whether they failed or not depends on what their true goals were.  You could say they were a spectacular success if their goals were libertarianism on taxes and corporate governance, open borders for corporations, endless wars to support Israel and the military industrial complex, and to purge true dissenters from polite society.  They did fail spectacularly on abortion, but had success with the cold war and not allowing 2A to be totally gutted.  But yes, from our goals they failed spectacularly.

                    Yes. Humans can only learn from the past,not the future. It makes sense to focus on the battle you just fought, to learn from it (like the way coaches study film of their opponents). Plus, the opponent wasn‚Äôt going around highlighting the new things they were doing, they worked in secret. So yes, the failure is understandable because it would take a perceptive, intelligent person to figure out what was coming next and the Buckleyites were definitely not smart enough.

                        The left‚Äôs long March through the institutions began generations ago and Buckley‚Äôs first book was all about the fertile ground they were encountering at Yale seventy odd years ago.
Now, it‚Äôs fair to say that he and his successors failed to realize how mind numbing lay stupid they would become.  But the nihilism, tactics and strategy were there all along.

                    They didn‚Äôt learn from it because magazine wasn‚Äôt at any point in the last I don‚Äôt know 3 decades and change maybe, actually Conservative. It  is a Conservative is an Attitude  not a Policy magazine  for bow tied looter cucks.What they espouse, Neo Liberal/Corporatist Economics doesn‚Äôt  conserve the traditional American yeomanry and therefore are not Conservative at all.Social Conservationism was banned from that magazine by the early 90‚Äôs about the time pat Buchanan as his ilk were shown the door by the Republicans. The watered down Liberalism they espouse, yesterdays Leftism really Conserves nothing and therefor isn‚Äôt Conservatism either.Actual Conservatism  is driven by tradition and stability and a sense of continuity of culture which rules out almost everything the Republicans do.

                    I agree with Drew. The Buckleyites didn‚Äôt really understand how dangerous the Progressives were (a mistake they repeated with the NeoCons). Buckley admitted he was with the Progs in an alliance to defeat the Marxists. As a man who served in World War II, he should have learned from the alliance with Stalin where such arrangements can lead. Then again, it was a different time and Buckley couldn‚Äôt imagine his countrymen were as vicious as the Soviets. He certainly didn‚Äôt foresee his movement would become indistinguishable from the Left.Anyhow, we are in a new, post-ConInc era. It will be unpleasant but with the chains lifted it is possible to ‚Äúwin‚Äù as we now have to define it, which is outside electoral politics and in service of our people.

                    Buckley himself got a dose of the New Left when Gore Vidal insinuated that he was a Nazi during an infamous debate. Instead of waking up to the new threat, Buckley and his followers engaged in an orgy of the we‚Äôre-better-than-that-ism that has perpetually hamstrung conservatism.

                        Being called a Nazi with WW2 fresh off the plate was hell of a thought stopper at that time.Beyond that its thought  that Buckley knew that Vidal knew he was anotherhomosexual and thus was hamstrung in his responses,Also the Eastern upper class speech police shirtsleeves like Scandinavian S.J.W. out of fear of losing status for being rude.Now had Vidal  who oddly I respect as an intellectual  though not a person tried that stuff with the DR at the time , he‚Äôd have gotten a  politer version ‚Äústuff it, if we were really Nazis you‚Äôd be whiffing Tabun by now, yet here you are  which is why he didn‚Äôt interact with muscular conservatives much.

            I wasn‚Äôt aware of this whole Schooner Creek Farm dustup. More degenerates tearing down anything good.What their enemies have to say about them speaks well of them: ‚ÄúThe idea of working hard and bettering yourself is central to this particular iteration of Neo-Nazism ‚Ä¶ Her gardening, cooking, and herbal remedies are all an important facet of her white supremacist identity.‚ÄùIf that‚Äôs Neo-Nazism, count me in.The author of thisFrontPage mag articleseems entirely too enamored of his own victim narrative to be trustworthy, and to him, this qualifies as bravery:After I read theNew York Timesarticle about protests against Schooner Creek Farm at the Bloomington, Indiana, Farmers Market, I did something that might seem incomprehensible for someone whose own flesh and blood has been harmed by various incarnations of racists, white supremacists, Nativists and the original Nazis. I went to the Facebook page for Schooner Creek Farms and I ‚Äúliked‚Äù it.Gosh, a Facebook like. Stunning and brave!As you go through the article, you realize that he‚Äôs the kind of civnat that will make harumphing noises about what is being done to the farm owners, but he will ultimately sacrifice them on the altar of egalitarianism and diversity. Because, ultimately, he thinks Dye‚Äôs beliefs are wrong, that she needs fixing or changing.Here‚Äôs some gaslighting about cancel culture: ‚ÄúCancel culture selects human sacrifices and tells us that that victim can never be any more than their worst act. Louis CK, Kevin Spacey, Dave Chappelle, Roseanne Barr, Roman Polanski, Chick-Fil-A, Covington Catholic schoolboys, Schooner Creek Farm, the list is endless.‚ÄùSome of those people are child rapists. Some said things people don‚Äôt like (or made facial expressions people didn‚Äôt like). Those are not the same thing.

            The GOP was already dying before Trump ran for POTUS. He gave a dying party a shot at life which they promptly pissed away. And when he leaves the party implodes for good. It will go the same way it did here in CA when the party committed suicide when Arnold left office.

                The Republican Party was dead in CA before that. Arnold could have revitalized it with a serious reform campaign. But what he actually wanted was just some accolades ‚Äì basically the same as Trump. With the difference that the national establishment went scorched  earth on Trump and he‚Äôs reflexively a fighter.

            Apparently, Fox has suffered significant losses in viewership over the last week amongst all of its big name players, including Tucker. More than 50% in most cases.Maria Bartiromo is the only one not losing massive ground, at least from the numbers I saw.Hope switching to pitching for Biden on election night was worth it, because they are literally losing half their audience.

That said, it looks like Boomers are going to get fucked whether they like it or not. I always thought the consequences of their largesse would come home to roost after they had passed ‚Äì on younger generations.
They went from the most privileged and easy lives, to being smothered out by a pillow because Shaniq‚Äôua was having a bad day. Not that things will be any better for us. But they will get a taste of their own medicine.

        Re woman playing college football.First, Sarah Fuller was not even the first to achieve this unremarkable ‚Äòaccomplishment‚Äô:‚ÄúPORTLAND, Ore. ‚Äî It was a historic weekend for college football, as Vanderbilt University‚Äôs Sarah Fuller became thefirst woman to play in a Power 5 conference football game. But it was more than 20 years ago when history was made at Willamette University in Salem. That‚Äôs when the first woman to ever play college football made headlines.‚ÄùSecond, as Z pointed out, below is the reality of a woman playing football with males:‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what happened in 1989, when 17 year old Tawana Hammond was allowed to play high school football for the Francis Scott Key Eagles as a fullback, notoriously one of the most brutal positions in the game‚Äîthe job requirements involve ‚Äúshedding tackles.She was tackled in her first scrimmage, got¬†internal injuries that required removal of her spleen and half of her pancreas and was in the intensive care unit for ten weeks, where she received 22 units of blood.She and her parents sued the school, on the theory that they ‚Äúfailed to warn‚Äù her that football was dangerous.‚Äùhttps://vdare.com/posts/what-happens-when-women-are-allowed-to-play-actual-contact-football-ten-weeks-in-intensive-care-after-one-scrimmage

        The Sarah Fuller situation could only happen at Vanderbilt.  An article at USA Today says they have been talking about bringing back last year‚Äôs kicker, who was competent and left the team with a year of eligibility remaining to enroll the medical school.  Think about that, he easily could have deferred medical school for a year and spent the fall kicking for the college football team while taking one worthless online class, but the Vanderbilt program is such a disaster he elected to get started on medical school instead.  The interim coach also told them several players are considering opting out.  This is what the rest of the team should do, shut down their season and refuse to play.  They can blame it on Covid and blunt most the elite media criticism.  Why let the school humiliate them like this.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/12/02/vanderbilt-female-kicker-sarah-fuller-play-against-georgia/3792155001/

                The game has now been postponed two weeks because Vanderbilt didn‚Äôt have enough players eligible due to Covid. I wonder if some opted out and they are refusing to report it. It will get canceled if Georgia ends up in the SEC Championship game. The only way that can happen is if Florida loses both their remaining games, which are against teams with losing records. I would bet this game gets canceled because Vandy players won‚Äôt play.Clay Travis is claiming he has talked to people in the program and former players who are disgusted by what they are doing with Fuller, but don‚Äôt want to speak publicly because of the blowback.  It is safe to say the players are staging a defacto boycott of this game.

            To be fair, though, if she was the women‚Äôs soccer team goalkeeper, she probably could kick farther than 30 yards.  She was probably a decent punter too, as that is also a common activity for a goalkeeper.  As you suggested, it was a deliberately designed shorter kick to avoid the risk of any physical confrontation between her and an opponent and some rather unpleasant headlines.

        In my experience, Jewish identity is highly encouraged and extremely strong.  Jews think about being Jewish A LOT.  My best friend‚Äôs brother made his foreign born Asian fiancee‚Äô convert to Judaism because the thought of having kids who were not authentically Jewish (being born to a Jewish woman) was horrifying to him. This is a guy who has been in a synagogue maybe 5 times in his entire life.  I don‚Äôt think I have ever met a Jew who was not self-consciously Jewish.

            He must have been hopelessly attempting to save face or something. Heritage and bloodlines are axiomatic to Judaism‚Äì more essential than any dogmatic spiritual system. That‚Äôs why ‚Äúsecular Jew‚Äù isn‚Äôt a misnomer.
If you told someone you wanted to convert to Judaism most would probably look at you weird and ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and then later mock you with a good ole ‚Äúgoyim‚Äù joke when you left. His kids will still be considered just half Jews, and since the Mom is Asian they‚Äôll be second class Jews whether she ‚Äúconverts‚Äù or not.

                It probably had more to do with the fact that she was Asian.  I think had she been a white girl, it wouldn‚Äôt have been as big a deal.  Without the Asian eyes, his friends probably wouldn‚Äôt even have asked and just assumed their mother was a tribe member in good standing.  But this is one of the evils of interracial breeding. It invites questions.She took him to the cleaners too and stuck him with the kid.  He didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, but what he had, she took. No child support either. He probably deserved it though. He is the biggest asshole I have ever met in my life.

        Lin Wood and Sydney Powell have great intentions, but I do think they are distracting from the strongest argument in the election fraud hysteria, which is ballot harvesting.  It was the perfect storm for ballot harvesting.  Send out millions of unrequested ballots to inner cities.  The local council members, who are affirmative action tokens with the avg IQ of a bonobo, will have their friends fill out tens of thousands of ballots across a 6 month time frame.  They watch to see which swing states are losing, then ship the votes in at the end.  Even without Covid, democrats spend hundreds of millions of dollars bussing elderly nursing home patients in democrat swag to voting booths.  My aunt described this after volunteering for years.  Ballot harvesting and fraud happen everywhere, but no one expected it to be this widespread.  Well, we did, but apparently Trump didn‚Äôt.  Point being, talking about venezuelan owners of software and servers pinging in germany is going to take years to prove, and the evil democrat judges are dismissing cases without even responding to the evidence claimed.

The point is, what is anyone going to do about it?  We are in a high stakes Mexican standoff game of chicken with the Elites (Dem and GOP), Trump, Trump voters/deplorables, AntifaBLM and auxiliary AWFLS, and who knows what other groups pointing guns at each other waiting to see who blinks first.

            Before I left California a number of years ago, the last range in my county closed because the county passed a law requiring that every time a person bought ammo there had to be a background check.  This was the last straw for the owners.  They told me that they just couldn‚Äôt operate under these conditions.
Nominally the 2A was not infringed upon but in practice the effect was the same.

            People don‚Äôt buy a just a box anymore for the range. They buy in bulk. 1000+. On credit!  Then don‚Äôt shoot any of it, because it‚Äôs expensive.
It‚Äôs crazy.

        Capiraso said he was ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù for the opportunity to have led the organization in the NYRR statement, which thanked him for his years of service.‚ÄúI understand what the board is saying, that they are making a decision after having listened to people,‚Äù Capiraso said in an interview with The New York Times.Firing is never enough with these people.  They want to humiliate their victims and make them pretend that this is just the right and just thing to do and preferably cry in public showing your deep shame about your racism.But humiliation and ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù your replacement won‚Äôt be enough for long. They will want you to commit suicide and if not, firing squad.

        With respect to data regarding East Asians being imprecise, a similar issue exists with ‚Äúhispanics‚Äù where the blond haired/blue-eyed Saxon from Buenos Aires is ‚Äújust as hispanic‚Äù as the pure-blood Aztec from Juarez.

        On the topic of anyone questioning the narrative being called a crazy person I want to post a longest quote from Eichmann in Jerusalem by  Hannah Arendt‚ÄúNo one bothered to swear the Jewish officials to secrecy; they were voluntary ‚Äúbearers of secrets,‚Äù either in order to assure quiet and prevent panic, as in Dr. Kastner‚Äôs case, or out of ‚Äúhumane‚Äù considerations, such as that ‚Äúliving in the expectation of death by gassing would only be the harder,‚Äù as in the case of Dr. Leo Baeck, former Chief Rabbi of Berlin. During the Eichmann trial, one witness pointed out the unfortunate consequences of this kind of ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù‚Äîpeople volunteered for deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and denounced those who tried to tell them the truth as being ‚Äúnot sane.‚Äù

        People who have faculty gigs at Loyola can live in adjacent neighborhoods of Roland Park or Guildford. That‚Äôs pretty posh, purely white (almost purely WASP), and pretty safe by anyone‚Äôs standards. I‚Äôm beginning to wonder whether you know anything about Baltimore.As for white solidarity, if you join the Elkridge Club, you feel tons of it.
