        “…Europe will have to go through a dark age, so to speak, before it can produce a genuine alternative elite.”Europe is already in a Dark Age. It plunged into it in 1914 and the lights are still off. It may be that some type of catastrophe similar to the two others will be required in order to sweep the political and economic stage clear of the 20th century debris that has piled up. I liken Europe to an old-growth forest with too much detritus on the forest floor. The next conflagration will be disastrous…whether fire or disease. The decadence of progressive policy has rendered European leaders totally impotent. Only a debauched elite would welcome waves of black and brown invaders.

                The difference is: the US is wielding a lot of power and is independent. The king of a debauched nation with a powerful army can swing one helluva wrecking ball.

                    And, I think Europeans tend to be more conformist than Americans.  This was very, very noticeable when I was in Britain, and it also seems true in countries on the continent.

                        I don’t think it’s possible to be more sheep-like than “Americans.” Actual sheep seem downright truculent and obstreperous by comparision.

                            You might be surprised.  Most people, all over the world, are sheep.  But there seems to be a more general willingness to really push back against “betters” and authority in the USA.  What I saw in Britain was really sickening, with a widespread, very slavish following of all forms of whatever was in fashion.  Not only in personal styles and that sort of thing, but also socially and politically.  And not only was the media there overwhelmingly globalist/leftist trash, but it continued to have more dedicated followers than what I’ve witnessed in the USA.  I haven’t changed my mind from what I’ve seen recently.To take a continental example, in Germany, AfD offers a glimmer of hope, but they have only gotten somewhere around 20% of the national vote, despite continual violence and other outrages by their “recent guests.”  The CDU continually broke major promises for years, and yet the lambs went willingly to the slaughter in the recent election, not having learned a thing.  And it’s still the party of Merkel, the woman who destroyed Germany, and who still looms large.Of course there are Europeans who see the truth, but they’re drowned out by censorship and the passivity of others.The USA isn’t what it used to be, but there’s still a lot of the old, good spirit.

                            I reluctantly agree, Mr Kozelskii. Yes, the controlled information-space of the time, TV and internet, made it seem that the only holdouts from masks, shots and social distancing were fringe lunatics. 2020 was in my view a test of the residual independence of Americans. And we failed, as a collective.
Covid-19 wasn’t a medical experiment so much as a social one.

                                I won’t say we did worse than the Europeans or anyone else, but just that the result was disappointing, to say the least.
We aren’t Daniel Boone or Davy Crockett any more – or Josie Wales or Dirty Harry or Mr Smith. Just meat units in a vast and impersonal empire. And that scares a lot of people. They’d rather have some jab of a mystery substance into their bodies than find new jobs or lose friends. Libs in particular. All fired up about banning GMO in our food, but actually volunteering to BE a GMO? No problem!

                                Agreed, abysmal failure. Shocking proof of the defeat, in detail of whatever someone muttered was “exceptional.’
It is disconcerting to have to live among our friends and families — The People of the Sheep. You can never really let them know your true thoughts while they prattle on about their every feeling. “I stand with Ukraine!”
Those billboards in front of many Protestant ‘churches’ that list the proclamations, their menu of ‘beliefs’ from BLM to ‘hate has no home’ ….
Muh, Taylor Swift. Muh, sportsball. On and on, while they chew their cud, oblivious to it all.

                    We cannot, and keep the same borders. I don’t give a flying excrement about loss of some land if it means a mostly homogenous national homeland. We need a border wall, and it needs to be north of Houston and Dallas with the Rocky Mountains as God’s contribution to the southwestern wall. Losing land and resources will be a good lesson to whatever ruling class replaces the current set of cockroaches that misrule means loss of wealth.

                        We need a homeland or limited suffrage for the contiguous US population.From todays missive:”The newest version is Jasmine Crockett, a representative from Houston, who had to learn how to sound like a ghetto queen in order to rise up the ranks.”She’s a good example of the need for separation.  She’s an obvious grifter and the Internet has shown her (miraculous) “before and after transformation for all to see.  Yet, her “constituency” voted for her overwhelmingly as they are too stupid or banal to see through her charade and/or vote in society’s best interest.It is impossible to reconcile with such a population.  We’ve got enough problems with Whites as it is.  More ethnocentrism from other races is impossible to absorb.

Same thing can be said of Obama.

Can’t see how we have any doubt who Obama is at this date.  When he first ran, there could be doubt—although you’d have to be pretty thick to not see he was a “manufactured” political entity by the Dem’s.  What was unknown—to me anyway—was which direction he’d take the country wrt race relations.  I was more naive and hopeful in those days.
Obama’s damage to the country still has not been reversed.

                                Yes. It tells us everything we need to know. Race and only race are the defining factor for them. Us and them; black and white.One thing I don’t think is right about the transformation videos. I think they are the classic fool’s errand of, “owning a lib.” Crockett transforms constantly in her real life. There are many blacks who speak normal American English out and about. However, get amongst only themselves and they all prefer and relish speaking eubonics. Not a single exception.In that sense, she is not transforming. She is not really performing. It is that she is no longer feeling compelled to perform and speak proper English in some circumstances. This transformation is another few swirls down the cultural toilet bowl. 75 years ago, the talented 10% strove to speak Latin and Greek and attend debuttente (sp?) balls with classical music … … Then the 60s revolution took hold and they dropped that pretense and settled into their natural biological desires.Now they twirk, and curse, and relish speaking pidgin and do all the things that we call ghetto but that they call normal. Crockett’s transformation is really a reflection that now, instead of feeling compelled to speak basic English, that norm is smashed as the culture is so thoroughly negrified that even that cultural norm and standard does not need to be observed as Latin, Greek and debuttante balls became unnecessary decades back.Snickering and laughing the, “hypocrisy”, is missing the point. The point is that it isn’t hypocrisy and we laugh and snicker at our peril. This is laughing while our culture descends into the next rung.Given no resistance where does it end? Jamaica? Haiti?I promise you Crockett neck rolls and finger wags and be tokkin like day aynt gon tellz me wutt tuh dooz every time she doesn’t feel the need to elevate. Now, she doesn’t feel the need to do do it in on the floor of the US Congress.Biological reality is a tough one. Laughing at the class clown never brings order back back to the classroom. Only one solution ever works for that.

                            Ethnic block voting has always been a problem in the US, it’s just especially bad with blacks. Even political views do not predict black voting problems.  Most blacks who hold a lot of “Conservative” views vote Democrat.   Many of the white subethnicities block voted like this and carved out their own little fiefdoms.But if the generic category “White” had any ethnic solidarity, the Congress would be 95% White. Sadly, this largely does not exist.

                            Right, it’s hard enough to get along with one’s own.  To add multiple alien populations into it all is completely insane.

                            DC’s negroes continued voting for the crack-smoking whorehound Marion Berry even after his misdeeds were captured on video. There is no living with a race of people who view debased criminality as “keeping it real,” and attempting to better oneself intellectually as “acting white.” We have no point of contact with such a people.

                                I have to disagree, as I knew and talked to a lot of blacks in DC at the time, it was a hot topic.They knew it was a setup by the FBI agent, the “ho” who kept demanding rock when what Berry wanted was sex. You see, the DEA had been using such stunts to replace the local cocaine lords, such as Berry, with more subservient Jamaicans.The locals had all gone to high school together, and, being Americans, were getting a bit too uppity (such as running a second time for mayor.) The Jamaicans would do anything the DEA told them to do, and frankly, those voodoo houngan MF’s were flat fookin’ scary. You ever hear of “plastic surgery?”(Neither had I. Your nose ends up touching the back of your head, with your face still attached. These savages were ridden by the same loa Hillary’s Pizzagate crowd was.)

                Europe recovered from the world wars quite nicely, actually. As did Japan. If life in present-day France, Germany or any other satrapy of the EU resembles a “dark age” it is not due to the world wars, but to the emergence of a malignant, post-national ruling elite. This notion that Europe’s fate was sealed in 1945 is simply, well, insipid. It’s like saying the US was doomed after the ructions of 1865, or that Rome’s demise was foreshadowed by the agrarian revolution. Sure, we can all play Oswald Spengler on the interwebs, but really. Who among us, transported back to (say) 1955, carrying our opinions with us, could look at Europe at the time and say, “folks, you have entered a dark age!”It’s all bullshit, all of this empty “whither Europe” crap. No one knows.

                    Uh. I didn’t say any of those things. It isn’t clear what you are addressing.That said, there are a decent number of thinkers from the early to mid 20th century who did say that Europe was entering a dark age. Several predicted how post-industrial materialism was affecting Europe and did not see any salvation coming. Could they have known what would have happened as it stands now? Well by 1970 “Camp of The Saints”, was written. In 1991, “If We Do Nothing”, was written. Here we are.You are right about the single event being easier to see in hindsight. One thing and one thing alone don’t make for a downfall. Death by a thousand paper cuts and all.There are any number of pivotal points that could have been tide turning but for one reason or another could not be pulled off, or that could have, but the spirit, will … … was lacking.In any case, I think it is hard to argue that Europe and the US are not in a late hour existential peril. That is, if you look at the situation from the standpoint of a people having a certain future as a distinct people in their ancient homelands. That doesn’t even bring in the civilizational question. Civilizations can wax and wane. A people’s existence, at least in terms of numerical significance and geographic security is fundamental. A civilization can be rebuilt or built anew, but if the people are gone or insignificant and/or impotent to do so, well, they won’t be the ones building anew.So, I hate to say it, but this isn’t the 1950s and uh whither European man?

            The whole point of “Europe” as we think about it today is to keep Europeans from actually asserting their own interests. Now, in 1945, I could see where this motivation came from. But here we are and the EU has trampled on every single member country and is run by a totally hostile elite group. They hate Europeans but love “Europe.” It’s a very bizarre situation, but Europe cannot be saved until these shackles are thrown off.

                The problem lies within.  The Europeans have forgotten what self determination is.  “Men without chests” as C.S. Lewis put it.  They are members of a dysfunctional family and the America is the abusive leader of such.  Better the devil you know as they say.  They’ve grown accustomed to the abusive parent and can think of no better life without such.  It’s a shame really.

                I agree, but suspect the tradcon core you refer to will be too tiny to resist the ‘elimination’ stage of what is unfolding.To me, their refusal to reproduce is entirely sensible. The is no evidence that whites in general can break free, and nobody likes the idea of fighting alone. Having kids automatically reduces the standard of living for anyone not rich, while adding cares and stress of enormous magnitude as you try to help carve a place for them in a dying system. I haven’t spoken to a huge number of Euro-whites, but among those few I have met it is very easy to get them to vent their resentment and exaspertion. They know everything’s broken and failing, and that there’s no one to fix it.I dread the thought of the dusky world to come. Better a meteor wipe the slate – start over again from the protozoa….

                    “Having kids automatically reduces the standard of living for anyone not rich,”Perhaps, but how about quality of life?  Something worth living for?  An environment you look forward to returning to after work everyday?So you are a bit poorer, so what! 99.9% of our ancestors lived in a poverty unimaginable to us. Even fairly recently, 80-90 percent of people lived as peasants.  Yet, they led their lives, had kids and did whatever it was they did and probably had a lot of good times in their lives.  Nobody needs to live as a peasant in the West even with a large family.

                        The problem with poverty for whites in AINO is that it generally means propinquity to negroes. I could easily do with much less than I have if I could continue living among my own kind. But with poverty comes relocation to the hoods and all the insufferable misery that entails.

                            Yes, but it depends on the area you are in.  If you want to live in a big city, you will definitely be in this position if you are poor.  But if you want to live in a rural area or even a suburb, it’s much less of an issue.Also, poor is relative.  I wasn’t really talking about poverty so much as a downgrade in your material standard of living.  Taking a standard of living drop might lower you a bit, but if you aren’t already in or near poverty, having to move to the hood is not going to be the result.  A lot of people waste a lot of money.  I know people who eat out almost every day. Most of the people I know eat out at lunch pretty much 5 days a week and probably weekends as well.  Buying the latest gadgets and a new phone every year.

            “…It plunged into it in 1914…”I would have to say that the ‘plunge’ predates that year, if you follow the machinations of people like Churchill, Grey, as they plotted for war against Germany, in cahoots with France, while even higher-ups in their own government were not aware of promises made that would eventually destroy millions of lives and multiple kingdoms and empires.If somehow we in the USA can shed our ties to these bloodthirsty criminals of the Old World, we would be better off by far. And just because the current year warmongers need to wear a brassiere means nothing – if Merkel was not Churchill in drag, well, you get my point.

        The reason Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers had to hire the actor Barry Soetoro to play Barak Obama was that the black community is not able to produce such a figure, so they had to manufacture one. The reason Obama has so quickly disappeared from the conversation is that he was always just an actor playing a role. The show ended and he left the stage. Like a typecast actor, he can only play this role and no one has much interest in the character, so he has sunk into obscurity.Yet I regularly encounter “conservative” readers and pundits both who view Barry as a mastermind, the secret power behind the Democratic party. It’s ludicrous.

            My very favorite part of the 2024 election was when they sent Obama out to campaign for Kamala Harris and he stopped into a Pittsburgh Democratic Campaign office to try to convince the black men working on the campaign to vote for Kamala.

            Dismissing him is also a mistake. He’s no mastermind but I still think he wields significant influence. This whole counter-narrative of him just being lazy and filling out his basketball brackets and being completely uninterested is just as wrong as the mastermind narrative. He is an evil SOB that helped destroy any semblance of racial harmony in the GAE.

                He’s so much not a mastermind that they have to have his handler, Valerie Jarrett, actually live with him. I presume to either keep him from doing stupid things or badger him to do what they need to do when they have a job for him.

            I don’t think of Europeans as “slaves.” They’re clearly the inferior subjects in the American empire, but they appear to me to be loyal foot soldiers in the GloboHomo/Feminist/Racial Egalitarian crusade.They’re not completely servile, with the exception of maybe the British. They give the U.S. blowback when it isn’t globalist and egalitarian enough, like the French during the Iraq war and the Irish for just about everything. They clearly dislike Trump and swooned over Obama. They are almost uniformly anti-nationalist and pro-brown immigration and pro-homo with the exception of a couple of eastern countries like Hungary and Serbia.I think they hate Russia not because they think Russia will invade France or Sweden, but because Russia is Christian Orthodox while Western Europe is atheist, because Russia is nationalist while the West is globalist, and because Russians believe in traditional male/female roles and oppose the queer agenda.Insofar as there are still some white, nationalist, heterosexual European guys who like hunting, poontang, and drinking, they are completely shut out of power, subject to stringent gun control, and ruled by women and homos.

Precisely.  The Enemy Within hate hate HATES them some Russia because Russia represents White Male Christianity.  Unapologetic and masculine Russia.

                    “Europe” shares a delusion with many of our guys. Russia as white hopeisn’t true, and Putin would imprison you for advocating it.
It’s the white country I like best. I wish it thought of itself that way. It doesn’t. That’s a legacy of communism, in part, but also a matter of imperial pragmatism.
Russia’s fight—on the meta level, where it’s about self-image—is for a globohomo without pederasty. That’s better, obviously, but it’s very, very bad.

                        My evaluation is similar.  Caution is due towards Russia but I note:
Russia does not degrade and disenfranchise its boys, men and dads.  Amerika-Globohomo does, with glee and enormous funding.  This is self-destruction.
Russia does not persecute Christians.  Amerika-Globohomo does, see Scamdemic for details.
Though Russia is not a ‘white nation’ per se, it also does not allow itself to be invaded by The World ™, handing out residence and goodie-bags.
Russia does not hate white people.  Amerika-Globohomo?  See Saint George Floyd.

        Even the younger Vietnamese are starting to ape the leftist white elite out here in California. They held out the longest among the Asian groups because almost every one was one of the “boat people,” or the parents or grandparents were. They hated communism. But after two generations, they’re assimilating into the California degeneracy.

            The dumbest thing conservatives have done lately is switching their rhetoric on DEI away from condemning anti-whiteness—they’re almost not allowed to say “anti-white” anymore; Rufo will call you a racist, etc.—to trying to stop “anti-Asian discrimination.” For the meritocracy!
No matter where they’re from, Asians are fromschool. What does every school teach? To hate white people. So the Asians do that—better than all the other students.
You don’t know what hate is if you don’t knowfully assimilatedprofessional-class Asians. Yes, they all have white husbands. Look at ’em.

        The only problem I have with this is that the European elites got a bit too uppity as house slaves. They insisted on pushing their censorship policies on to the American people and tried to throttle the tech giants. Starmer’s government went so far as to threaten American people with their censorship laws. Lastly, they have always tried to push their climate cult policies onto the rest of the world, including America. Perhaps this was due to the Biden administration favoring these policies. But there was a spirit of independent emphasis on the part of European elite for these policies.Trump realizes empires are expensive to maintain and is downsizing as a consequence.

            Trump realizes empires are expensive to maintain and is downsizing as a consequence.I really do agree with Z’s view that Trump is treating all of this like a businessman coming in to restructure and save a failing company. Chief among this approach is a thorough examination of the books to see just what the Hell is going on around here. We’ve already seen that USAID was just a giant slush fund that barely sent anything on to other countries, and what it did send on was spent on profoundly foolish items.Now he looks at Europe as a money losing division that needs to be spun off or closed down. Of course the Euros are worried and angry since it means they’ll have to stop (or at least cut) spending on Cradle – to – Grave socialism (which they could implement because Uncle Sam picked up the tab for defense). The natives ain’t gonna like that, nor will the “immigrants”. Expect things to get more “stabby-stabby, splody-splody” over there if the Diversity gets cut off the rolls.

What’s happening at least in the back of the minds of Canadians is “Those cowboy Americans will pay for all the guns, because they don’t want Canada invaded out of self interest”. Thus they feel free to spend money on any number of social programs that are unaffordable to the US, despite printing money. They will say it, if asked politely.Europe, with it’s own deep military traditions, has viewed the US in largely the same way. Trump is now saying, to them at least, “Good luck, you’re on your own”

        Zman’s own theory of positive/negative identity is likely an excellent predictor of the countries which can survive intact, along with historical cohesion. On these criteria, you’d expect Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Holland, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Norway, Greece, Sweden, Portugal, Czechia, Slovakia to make it. Germany (negative identity), Belgium (Flemish already hate Walloons, then add Africans), Ireland (negative identity) have almost no chance. Rumania, Finland and Baltics have a good shot. UK and France are underdogs. The others are toss-ups (Spain, Italy, France).

        It seems like success in our current political system is mainly about avoiding stepping on rakes when you are temporarily occupying your current office. See Karen Bass. People forget that she was being considered for VP by Biden. She had serious aspirations but they are likely done now because of the LA fires. Of course, the fires were not her fault. Yea, the government enabled them and the LA Fire Department was primarily a lesbian grooming operation and secondarily a firefighting outfit, but this has nothing to do with Karen Bass. Karen Bass is not a real executive with actual policies and vision. She just went in there and did what she was told. But still, it is over, and the system has shifted to people like Wu and Crockett. All these people are the same. Michelle Wu accidentally sent out a “no whites allowed” party invite to the Boston city council but suffered no ill effects – IIRC the party still went on! This is because, obviously, the people who engineer and groom people like Michelle Wu hate whites. So it’s fine. This is how it works.

            That was the least of Wu’s anti-White policies. Under her reign she organized massive international PR campaigns for Boston’s tourism initiatives. The PR campaign explicitly excluded White owned businesses and districts where the businesses are still primarily White owned. If that wasn’t enough, she proposed taxes be levied exclusively on White owned businesses. The no-Whites-allowed Christmas party with her and a bunch of blacks LARPing as Boston Brahmins in a finely 17th century European parlor ala Haiti’s generals LARPing as European warriors was just a cherry on top.It is a terrible thing to follow the real news. Wu is not a clown. She is a dangerous predator as are all of these anti-Whites. Even if they think this is a joke, we should not. Real actions flow from this animosity, and I am sure real money flows to it as we are dispossessed and abused.America once had a rich traditions of dealing with corrupt local officials. If there are enough of us left in places like Boston, it might be time to resurrect those traditions and customs. If not, in the places where there are enough left, that kind of predation should not be tolerated even a single time.

            Europe is a big place my guy. When we say “Europe” we are primarily talking about the Western powers. UK, France, Germany primarily. With a dollop of Belgium, Netherlands, and Spain perhaps. These places are bad but look at the list at the bottom to understand the -relative- problem to the States.Italy now has Meloni, step in the right direction. And places east of Austria are NOT like this. Try some monkey shines and TNB in the Balkans. I dare you…Poland is at war, liberal stupid women are pushing them ever more towards wokeness but their men are starting to assert too which is NOT happening in parts West.Hungary as most know is based AF, much like the Balkan nations. Baltics pretty based excepting perhaps Estonia.In the 21st century, the last bastion of true whiteness will be in this region. Hence why I’m actively and aggressively working to put down roots here right now.I’m in a SEA of white here. A literal sea. I’ve attached some helpful stats below. Look at the very bottom of that list and despair. I think many people here are not aware of the true numbers when they are talking about how cooked “Europe” is.

                My spy in the region reports similarly about Eastern Europe and the Baltics.  Great place for U.S., Canadian, Brit and Western European men to relocate.‘Poland is at war, liberal stupid women are pushing them ever more towards wokeness but their men are starting to assert too which is NOT happening in parts West’Indeed.  Only the ‘manosphere’ is relevant.  U.S. men are frozen at the gate in this race.The manosphere is sufficiently relevant to be #1 on the FedGov’s enemy list.  (As demonstrated by the short-lived Disinformation Governance Board.)  Where is the rest of U.S. masculinity?  Keeping its head down and doing what it’s told.If U.S. and anglo-nation men aren’t asserting against their feminist countries, it’s not because they weren’t told the truth.  So, the failure is on their own souls.

        With regards to chaos.  Natural systems, including human societies, function in a dynamic that moves from order to chaos.  The order looks like an equilibrium, and we take it as “normal” when it is just a phase in order/chaos dynamic.  We can intervene to preserve order, but the price is even greater chaos when the system flips.
Be grateful for Trump, further extension of the order that the USA lived under would have led to a horrible chaos, one that is still possible given the deep distortion of reality that extending the managerial order has inflicted on the country.

        i don’t see how the current elite is left alive (after US) goes home.  the native population hates them with a white hot rage, but so do the newly imported “natives”.

            Maybe the imported browns will take care of the white house slave rulers of Europe? The good white people of Europe do not despise the white overlords enough because they are similar to them in blood, maybe it’s best to face the brown Islamic hordes because they will be very different in blood and culture?Francis Yockey wrote that Europe would have been better off under the  communism of Stalin rather than the liberal democracy of the aliens ruling the United States because Europe was more likely to reject Soviet communism because it was so different in its culture while the United States sparkles like Hollywood and is attractive to Europeans but rots Europe from within.Time has proven Yockey correct, Eastern Europe countries ruled by communism for nearly 50 years such as Hungary and Poland are far stronger culturally than Britain, France, and West Germany. Afd gets a lot of support from the formerly communist east Getmany.There is no easy way out for Europe, it may take generations to retrieve its culture, if it can be retrieved?

                    “it seems like the animating force of the CCCP transmigrated to the US, and is still ‘alive’.”Indeed it has and is.  I’ve said this on this site many times and always get pushback from the hairsplitters:The left, the commies, the progressives, whatever you want to call them WON the Cold War.  The West (nationalists, nativists, conservatives, whatever you want to call THEM) LOST.  Every White country with the notable exception of Russia and a few other eastern Euro countries turned unmistakably leftward after the Berlin Wall fell. This what the war in Ukraine and all the Russophobia that led up to it is all about. It irks the left to no end that they lost the Big One, the one they had for 80y, their great Marxist experiment (c’mon you hair splitters, this where you tell  me “the West in not Marxist, the west is more of corporate-fascist entity, the West is…. blah, blah, blah, oh yes, and don’t forget to quote Hegel, or Gramcist, Fukuyama, or some other “authority”). Bollocks. Sure we have all the trappings and convenience that the Soviet bloc never dreamed up of, but that’s because we had decades of (mostly) free capitalism that built our modern world. As we’ve all opined ad nauseum on these pages, that world is slowly coming apart, due to the west being controlled for the past 35y by….. drum roll please…. the Left.  Prove me wrong.  Do your best.

                        Only one quibble: it is 80 years rather than 35 years. There is no need to focus on the labels. The West lost.

                Perhaps an upside of the current wave of immigration is that they are not assimilated. They are not the Visigoths in the 5th century. These people dont want to be European (or American). They come for the gibs and to get access to White women. They’re not even like our immigrants who for better or worse at least, until very recently, actually did come to work.If Europe collapses and they don’t get any of either then they are likely to just go home. They’re not going to take on the trappings of the European regime and seek out some sort of continuity the way Odoacer did.

        “Even now, when they all agree Trump is a big meanie”They treat Trump as an aberration, an anomaly. They sigh with nostalgia for Biden, Obama, GWB, Clinton. They call Trump a bully and “erratic.” They seem not to understand that “cometh the hour, cometh the man.” That the USA itself is in a crisis stage, has its back to the wall, and can no longer serve as hegemon and global policeman. They can’t get it into their thick skulls that the old game is over, the rules are obsolete. Taking care of Europe is a losing proposition and Trump has said this consistently for years.There was an interesting essay penned by a retired French diplomat a couple of weeks back:https://aurelien2022.substack.com/p/a-swan-song-for-europeThe problem for Europe is not just the bogeyman of Russia but that it is not one, and never has been for around 1500 years. The father figure of the USA could keep the squabbling European children in line but once absent, the squabbling will begin again. And among other things, a unified defense structure is out of the question. It will just be another massive bureaucracy with little to show for massive expenditure (not that the funds are there, given Europe’s economic decline).With regard to the USA, the situation is like the empire in Asimov’s Foundation trilogy: the USA will be cutting lose its periphery to concentrate on keeping the remaining core under control. This might work for a time.“She is the South Asian version of the Sambo”East Asian

                And isn’t Boston’s Mayor married to a white man? It’s like the first thing the invaders do, when their bright children get to Harvard/Yale/med/law schools. They locate some naive white guy/girl, from an elite background if possible, and latch on for the ride. I have seen this happen in my own family, which has that sort of educational background. Look at J. D. Vance, with Usha at his side, smiling sweetly. Three kids — and no more blue eyes;-)

                    Look at Vance’s mother-in-law. She is a Phd who was on the Vanguard of pushing DEI at San Diego State. An American state University with a Hindu provost/dean and a colonized faculty that is engaging in a pogrom of Americans.Then the great identitarian hop is her son-in-law. There is a photo of a family gathering. Vance and a couple of aging white guys at a backyard pool and then a massive family of subcontinentals.I wonder if the family is divided now that Vance is on an anti-DEI crusade.This thing is so incoherent and compromised it doesn’t know where to begin.

                        Everything about Vance either causes alarm or questions. He clearly was groomed by Silicon Valley to play a Pied Piper role for Heritage Americans. The question we are faced with is whether this is worse than the alternatives. I don’t think so but could be convinced.

                            Yep.  It is a short and logical step from seeing the “heroic” White guy surrounded by a sea of muds, to seeing the heroic mud surrounded by a sea of Whites.  Obama was a good example of such from the Left.We are being conditioned and that conditioning is subtly different from what has gone on for decades now.  No longer is it simply seeing muds in public life.  It is now seeing muds as important to traditional White values.  An interchangeability if you will.  This of course is a ploy.  Once the interchangeability becomes accepted, the mask will come off and we will see the racial ethnocentrism of muds appear.

                    This also a function of the white woman’s screeching feminism. The yellow and brown ladies actually give these guys attention and a simulcra of a traditional woman. The young white women have chips, slut around, and are in general totally out of control.  At the least, they are unfriendly.

                        It is a shock to Amerika men when they travel out of country.  The women often are friendly, feminine, and unspoiled by being a Princess all their lives.
Returning to Amerika is flat-out depressing after seeing what other parts of the world are like.

            the squabbling European children in line but once absent, the squabbling will begin again
Yes. Macron is touting French arms and indicating his country is ready, willing and able to become the continental leader. The UK and Germany nod along as they plot how to play the role France envisions. It is all fantasy and nonsense, of course. While I loathe what “Biden” did and the Blob in general, the erratic behavior of European leaders/figureheads has explained in part why the Ukraine idiocy was indulged. Z is exactly right about slaves–they kind of like it.

        The paragraph about Obama stood out to me. I’ve heard from at least a few Boomer conservative-types that the half-black messiah was running the Biden Administration from behind the scenes. That always struck me as funny because, like Zman, I view Obama as an actor whose role called on him to deliver lines from a script with little or no input of his own regarding policy. It seems even some on the Right have fallen for the idea that the man is some kind of savant.

        There was a time – briefly – in the nineties when Europe looked like the Next Big Thing. The end of the Cold War meant it did not have to lean on the US for military security, and with the development of the EU and its common currency, Europe looked formidable on paper, with a collective population and economy far larger than the US.It turns out, unsurprisingly in retrospect, that you can have an empire, or you can have nations, but you can’t have both. Europe’s “leadership” is now drafted from the post-national, Davos class hatched and financed by American money. With the necessary outcome being that the EU can only hold itself together by dissolving “European” identity itself, along with all the traditional national identities of its member states. Small wonder that no normal European wants to fight for “his” “country”.By all economic, demographic and even military measures, Europe was stronger during the Cold War before it became “Europe”, when being “european” meant being first a Frenchman, or Spaniard, or Finn, etc.People forget that in living memory countries such as France and Great Britain showed some independence in defense policy even when the Cold War was at its height. France in particular, which left NATO in 1966 and developed its own nuclear deterrent; and even the Brits went to war with Argentina in 1982 without (at first) the blessing of the US. Say what you will about guys like De Gaulle and Mitterand, they weren’t America’s streetwalkers.As an American, part of me thinks that the EU can go shit in a hat, but as a westerner, another part of me grieves for the old continent.

        The trend that is emerging is for the emergent American oligarchy to lend support to an emergent and very young European identitarian counter-elite. It is starting with Twitter/Musk being used to lend legitimacy to nationalist movements on the ascent but being oppressed. The next, inevitable step will be what always has to happen for nationalist/localist/particularist political movements to have a chance at success. That is financial and logistical support.What is strange is that merchant oligarchies are filled with contradictions and incoherency. Can Karp, Musk, Ellison … … help emergent European nationalists while selling their oppressors the tools of a dystopian techno-authoritarianism? Do Karp and Ellison really want European nationalists to ascend?America is so filled with incoherent and contradictory forces and ideas that it is hard to tell up from down and left from right.It could be that while America seems to be fighting for re-establishing itself as a sovereign and real country, it is merchant to its core. So, its plan to save itself, seeing itself as a balance sheet with assets to sell to stay solvent, will amount to selling itself off to foreign predators in order to save itself.The latest outrage is Doug Bergam partnering with the HUD secretary to propose building affordable housing throughout the American interior and West. The merchant order will destroy itself, but it will destroy us all and everything we love in the process. America has its own slavery it cannot shake. It is enslaved to being a business – a hopelessly corrupt business where every predator on the savannah can easily come and get its fill.

            Speaking of foreign predation. These are recent ideas proposed by, “conservatives.”https://amgreatness.com/2025/03/21/how-president-trump-can-deploy-a-missile-defense-shield-to-defend-america-in-only-three-years/This is my favorite. It probably dovetails perfectly with the Bergum/HUD-secretary announcement and it was probably paid for by Fink/Kushner as a way to get in on even more of the action:https://americanmind.org/salvo/from-illegal-immigrants-to-republican-voters/The only path forward and path for survival in North America for European people is to understand that this is not a country. It is certainly not your country. It is a flea market. Every faction that organizes and understands what this is will be in a position to fleece it. There are 180 million European people here. We are the Americans. We are still bamboozled into thinking that we will vote for someone who will finally bring our country back. The problem is Fred Fleitz and emissaries of Fink/Kushner are everywhere on every last side and faction that may have some say in where the money goes.We need to establish redoubts that are homes. From there, we need to go a-Viking and join the bands of legalized and sanctioned marauders. Our angle and it is a tough one is to figure out how to be of service and protect our people from the Fire Sale. Not sure how to do that. In any case, the rules haven’t changed. Under Biden we were in the hyper-looting phase. It was the looting style of the Left. Under Trump we are still in a hyper-looting phase. It is just a different kind of looting and a different kind of looter.

                Good Lord. There is no political solution. Those soothing essays are like the candy held by the owner of the van. Voting can be tool if it helps sow discord but that’s about it.
eta: Sorting already is underway and we see redoubts in their embryonic stages. We saw how “Biden” responded. If or whether Trump responds will be interesting. Disinterest is our friend.

                It’s not even sad or darkly amusing to see posts like those you’ve linked.  It’s profoundly pathetic.  The vast majority of internet comments I scan (from purportedly conservative/maga blogs to YT videos to DailyMail and news aggregators) are civnat/colorblind goodwhytes attacking the ‘left’ for focusing unnecessarily on ‘insignificant’ factors like race and using it to ‘divide’ people.  They claim to abhor DEI and favor merit, so that if a biological woman can pass the same physical qualifications as a man, she is ‘equal.’  No comprehension of the different social dynamics or sexual tension this brings into play.  They decry all the east Asians arrested of late (fedgov, military, academia, NY police) as ‘traitors’ – when they have always and only been loyal to their people rather than to their magic paper citizenship.Waiting for normie to genuinely come to grips with the bonds of race and what genuine nationalism mean is a losing strategy.  It fascinates and disgusts me – like watching a car wreck – to see the degree to which they’ve been mindwiped.

                    I’ve been working on a Christian, conservative normie friend of mine for a few years now.  It is truly remarkable how ingrained the “everyone is a child of God” fantasy is in their heads.  The only thing that might get him to this side of the divide is if his son, who he is super close with, has an encounter with a feral.  Maybe then, and a big MAYBE, he will come out of the virus.  He is one of those who thinks that if you just show them another graph, or another chart, they will come around.  “We need to vote them out!” and “They should file a lawsuit” are things he commonly says, having zero understanding that the country he grew up in no longer exists.  It’s immensely tiring, but I have to remember, I was once a conservatard too.

                        Christian conservatives are some of the hardest to break of their conditioning. I’m not even clear that even an interaction with a feral would change most. How can you observe the modern world and not have snapped out of it? They’ve been totally conditioned to believe that letting people destroy your culture and people is love and exactly what Jesus would want.  Our mutual enemies have done an immaculate job harnessing this forgiveness and trust against us.

                        When I read your description of your friend I am struck by how natural it is for whites to believe that all races are the same and that few should be turned away. Further, it is so natural for whites to believe in the power of reason to persuade others.
NO OTHER RACE SEES THE WORLD THIS WAY! And the whites can’t even see that!
Maybe whites are just like this but then I remember the Vikings and the Christians who beat back the Muslims. My fear is that all of our warriors were killed off.

                    My Trump loving brother, who has an optimistic temperament, tries to cheer me by noting that some popular conservatives have stopped saying that the USA is a proposition nation, but instead that it is a country of actual people with a culture and history.  They also say there are just two sexes.
He cites Steven Crowder and Matt Walsh as examples.  I haven’t been able to confirm, but then again, it’s hard for me to watch much of those guys.
Can anyone confirm that some of the edgier conservatives are turning our way?

                        Don’t expect such a confirmation from me.  Some may accept there are only two sexes, but they believe women should have equal civic rights and roles.  They may tiptoe up to race realism, but they will rave about Sowell and Thomas and they all have an IKAGO.  No one is willing to accept that equality (of ability or opportunity) exists nowhere in nature and is a piss-poor fantasy on which to base a society.  Until they jettison that lie, all the rest is just noise.

                            My take also.  And I’ve trolled through Breitbart for a dozen years.
The Righties are budged only by the direst personal disasters.  And even that sometimes doesn’t do it.
This time the Enemy conquered by making material life so good, men would betray their own God and brothers to retain it.
Conservative men are willing to be ruled by women if life is sufficiently comfortable.  They are made to eat — and often to extoll — the Big Lie of Equality.

                        Walsh recently said that he’s proud of what the early American settlers did by conquering the land and defeating the Injuns.  Sure, that’s a good position to take and one I agree with, but the main problem is that MAGA/republicans/grillers are always content with words in lieu of action.  As long as you’re telling these people what they want to here, they couldn’t care less about the problems being solved.  Based on his first couple months in office, Trump is specifically catering to this type of character.

            Everything makes more sense when you view what’s happening to America the same as what happened to Russia after the USSR collapsed; the complete looting of productive assets by a (foreign) parasitic oligarchy.  You just saw it with Howard Lutnick bragging about selling a few billion worth of those Gold Cards to foreigners, which is an easy way for them to snake their way into US politics and game the system.  Now, Burgam and HUD are looking to take federal land and sell it to their developer friends so they can house more immigrants.  You summed it up perfectly:“The merchant order will destroy itself, but it will destroy us all and everything we love in the process”As I mentioned in a post on Friday, we are only susceptible to this tomfoolery because we ceased being an honor culture and have fully embraced the money-above-all-else mercantilism.

        The political changes in AINO would have been impossible without the loss of faith in the MSM. In Europe, no similar process has occurred. There, the official Narrative remains the predominant “reality.” And probably will for the foreseeable future, as there is no sufficient mass of “nationalists” to counter both the many baizuo (who are a greater percentage in Europe than in AINO) or the election rigging, which is just as bad as in AINO if not worse. IOW, the current European “leadership” class is probably going to go down with the ship.

        The over-the-top bashing of Europe from white Americans never felt right to me, and the pessimism never quite lines up with my actual experience when I travel through those countries.  Europe isn’t done – they’ve been closer to destruction in the past.  Yes, London was a mess of foreigners, but the countryside was a different story.  Yes, many of the leaders are buffoons, but I’ve found the average young north western euro to be smart, helpful, and aware.  Yes, the demographics aren’t great, but they’re not great anywhere truly industrialized.  It’s not clear that they’re great for the immigrant pops _in_ those industrialized, western countries.  Well-to-do Americans I know still want Porsche 911s, German (and Austrian) weapon contracts are signed by the American military, German engineering is still considered top notch, Airbus is in a better spot than Boeing, etc..I don’t feel any doom and gloom towards Europe or Europeans – they’ve made some dumb moves over the past century, but I’d bet on their cultures lasting long into the future.  If one takes the Lindy effect seriously, then they’ll outlast the US.

            Good point.  The anti-European stuff really took off after Trump’s election, spearheaded primarily by Vance and the MAGA influencer crowd.  They usually attack it from the standard Republican perspective that Europeans are freeloading socialists who are taking advantage of the poor helpless Americans.  It’s very tiresome.  More to the point, who benefits from ensuring the two largest blocks of Whites globally are at odds with each other?

        I’m left wondering what does it mean to be “European”? The wholesale rejection of Christian morality both in Europe and America implies the elites have embraced suicidal cosmopolitanism. The elites of the GOP are the most pathetic example of political suicide in history.QUOTE:Returning to the Republican Party, we see a political side that claims to support many of the same things as Christians – such as the elimination of abortion and same-sex marriage. Yet, the 2024 Republican Party Platform is interestingly muted on all social subjects. It takes no such clear stance on issues of morality. Additionally, many of the leaders within the Party support sinful behaviors that are antithetical to Christians, including Donald Trump. For example, two of Trump’s most senior members are homosexuals (Treasury Secretary Bessent &amp; Special Envoy Richard Grenell). Finally, the unabashed defense of the Jewish state calling itself Israel – a country literally predicated on a defiant rejection of Jesus Christ – is an open embrace of those whom John the Apostle called “antichrists” (1 John 4: 2-3) and Jesus Christ called the children of the Devil (John 8:44).By contrast, the Republican Party has supported military activities that have no historical basis of justification. The party has supported the bombing and killing of civilians around the world for no discernable purpose other than the propagation of lascivious behaviors. In other words, the Republican Party supports a war against a country like Iran because it will not allow homosexual television content.https://identitydixie.com/2025/03/24/more-christian-than-the-republican-party/

        ‘Since a Donald Trump like figure must come from the field slave population, this sort of figure is not just feared by the European house slave population but despised by the field slaves of Europe’Of course, L’Orange is not a field slave.  He is a plantation owner born into great wealth and privilege.What field slave rises to power in Amerika?  I see none.  There’s JD, lookin good homie except . . . hm Yale Law Journal, venture capitalist with Thiel, not so rootsy there eh?‘The reason Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers had to hire the actor Barry Soetoro to play Barak Obama was that the black community is not able to produce such a figure, so they had to manufacture one’Barry was ‘manufactured’ long before the Sixties Rads got ahold of him. Manufactured describes it exactly. Mama was an intel asset, amongst other things.  No chances were taken with The Lightbringer and they scrubbed his backtrail best they could.

            Not true: the Trumps were “middle class, nice neighborhood (Queens) 20th century ‘murcans” :white collar, middle class, but NOT highfallutin’. Their family was friendly with my ex’s father’s family: church picnics, the bridge club, etc. Fred Trump developed shopping plazas, etc., until…he went into business with Govt., and started developing outerboro hi-rises and other residentials. THAT is where/when the Trumps started “movin’ on up.” so to speak.(Why go into business with the Feds? Fred figured out that having feds around around at  the jobsite and in the project office worked as mob-repellant. And remember, the mob squeezed everything and everybody in the second half of the XXth century in NYC. Cheeto Hilter later realized that celebrity – i.e., having newsmen at the jobsite and in the office – worked pretty well in that regard, too!)

                ‘Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire at age eight by contemporary standards’There were four kids, so that’s $80,000 per year total, in Fifties dollars.Not too many middle-class folks in the Fifties paid their kids 265 grand per year.Or even $20,000 per year.  I grew up working class (LMC) in the Fifties, and I recall life clearly.  We scrambled to cash-in pop bottles we’d collected from the neighborhoods.  Cut lawns for $5.  My middle-class friends were only marginally richer.You are either quite ignorant of reality, or just a common liar.  Liking Donald Trump isn’t a good reason to lie.Be more careful in telling me that a fact I know for certain is not true.  In fact, just shut up around me.

                    Don’t know where you get your info from, and i am am not inclined to squabble: Mine comes from personal anecdote, Bob W. (retired cop, now in his 80’s),  reported to me (Mary Trump was Bob’s school sweetheart, btw…)  that Fred moved nickels like manhole covers (and Bob’s a one himself, I assure you!), and made a social faux pas when he got himself a chauffer (!). The neighbors said “c’mon, Fred!”, and he went back to driving his Chrysler Newport back and forth from Queens to to the jobsites in Brooklyn himself –for shame! Yes, the family got rich, but not until Donny was well into his teens, From what I gather by their long-ago aquaintences, they are smpy not…aristocrats, by any strech of the imagination. They got wealthy, but started out  otherwise.

Do you always base your knowledge about the world on somebody’s ‘anecdote’?  The reason there are published reports about things — including the Trump family money — is so we don’t have to make up the facts, i.e., lie.

        With respect to Ukraine, they feel like they have been sent out of the room as the master talks to another master.Also, they’re presumably a bit disoriented that Orange Retard has just reversed seven decades worth of Western security structure, ripping up the rule book overnight. European politicians have to live with their Washington overlords long after Trump is gone, so maybe the prudent choice is to run out the clock.And if Trump wants to set Europe free, he can start by withdrawing the American occupation forces, rather than threaten to landgrab Euro territory for asset stripping.It is why there will be no European Donald Trump anytime soon. The idea of such a character terrifies the typical European … The glimmer of hope is the nationalist parties emerging…We’ve had natpop parties in Europe for decades, they usually either ceiling out at 20-25% of the vote, like Front National, or they’re coopted by the blob and neutered, like the Scandi parties. The difference is that in Europe, “nationalist” implicitly means “white nationalist.”…but they are often as clownish as the establishment.And Trump is not? Or Musk?The New And Improved Maga is in for a rude awakening, like the one Farage-fans in Britain are now struggling with.

This. If it were attempted, of course, who actually runs the Global American Empire would become even more obvious, if that is possible. The reason the occupation forces will remain is due to domestic concerns.

Any suggestion of it would have the entire political class chaining themselves to American military hardware so it could not be returned home. And for the record, Ukraine ain’t Europe.

                They most likely would, yes, but as you have so convincingly argued, it’s not like they have any choice in the matter.
As for Ukraine, it’s America’s tar baby. Europe was getting along just fine with Russia in the late noughties, early tens, when Washington allowed such rapprochement. None of the idiots playing politicians here could place it on a map before they were ordered by their Judeo-American masters to adorn their social media with Ukie flags and start saying Keef.
And now they’re being told it’s their mess. No wonder they’re upset.

                    America has a lot to answer for regarding the ruination of Europe. As Hans Hermann-Hoppe makes clear in his recent talk, we all know why that is.As for Ukraine, Europe is not upset because Trump is handing it over to them. They are upset because he is taking it away from them. He will make whatever deal he makes with the Russians and then tell Ukraine to accept it. If it means getting rid of Zelensky, then they get rid of Zelensky. Europe will have no say in the final disposition of Ukraine.Frankly, I think this is an error. Trump should hand Ukraine to Europe. It might be the trigger to begin the transition from servitude to self-assertion.

                        That would reverse the American Russia-policy that’s been playing since the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999: encircling Russia and gradually tightening the noose. Cutting Ukraine loose would amount to scrapping core NATO doctrines.And I’m not as sanguine about Russia as most of ourguys; Russia will not always be led by a reasonable, peace-loving Europhile like Putin. Most of the alternatives would actually want to invade Europe, or at least the Baltic States, maybe Poland.Mind you, I suspect we currently have little idea what’s going on behind in the back rooms of the extravagant, three-ring Trump circus; as I said, I believe we’re in for a big rug-pull, but that’ll all be made clear in half a year or so.

                            I actually think the insanity of the Ukraine war was a case of the European tail wagging the American dog. Everything you laid out seems true, but behind the scenes I suspect the Euro puppets were telling D.C. to hold their beer. I’m agnostic on Russia, but certainly what has happened and what is happening could embolden a future nationalistic leader there.

                                The 2014 coup was an entirely American affair: “Fuck the EU”, as Victoria Nuland said, and Ukraine has been a CIA/Neocon fiefdom since then.
I see it as a replay of the 2008 Georgia-thing, where Saakashvili, propped up by the Cheney cabal, and with troops trained by the US, decided to shell resident Russians with MLRS in South Ossetia.
Only back then, the Russians reacted instantly, and came down on Georgia like a pregnant brontosaur dropped from orbit, not giving the US time to mobilize world opinion for an intervention before it was all over.

                                    The United States certainly bears responsibility for the events leading to the war. Serbia/Kosovo in particular poisoned the well due to the religious/ethnic/cultural insult it represented. But it seems as far as the Ukraine War itself the European leaders/vassals took a wildly disproportionate lead in the hostilities; the GAE seemed content to confined itself to the usual passive/aggressive fuckery.Much of this also has been extra-governmental, too, with transnational corps pulling lots of strings apparently in a quest to grab resources. I don’t believe the 4D chess BS for a nanosecond but Trump seems to be tweaking something that was going on behind the scenes with his dwelling on the rare earth mineral aspect. Whether intentional or not it is pulling into the sunlight what usually is done by the Usual Suspects in the shadows.

                                    The main difference between South Ossetia and Ukraine is that the Georgian army was quite small and weak compared to the Russian forces.
In contrast, the US and NATO had many years to build Ukraine into a large, well-equipped force that at points rivaled the size of the Turkish Army.

                            Nothing wrong with Russia invading the Baltics in particular. They aren’t real countries and need to be slapped down so hard that they will never come back. Finland, Poland and Rumania the same. None of them are real countries in any sense. Sure, they have languages and customs and all but they could function as regions of Russia and the world would be much more peaceful if their managerial class was all in the Gulags. There are just some peoples who just can’t get along with others no matter what.My personal opinion is that Poland bears watching. They have delusions of empire from the Baltic to the Black and are building an army for offense not defense. The borderlands just need to be emptied and resettled with White folks who want to live in peace and not have delusions of grandeur.

                    It is their fucking mess. They grabbed bidens tit and never let go. Never seen such a pathetic display by obvious vassals as the 2021 to 2024 period. And Europeans kept electing the scum and begging to be ruled by socialist freaks in brussels. It’s your mess and if you want another  Gustav, napoleon or hitler, it’s on you to dig your own grave. You’re electing the people to do it for you that’s for sure.

            Dumbass Europeans aren’t our concern. We wasted enough treasure and men on that dump and the perpetual European conflict. Once we leave you can go back to killing each other like always. We survived without a poland existing for over 100 years and will do it again.

            Wisdom as expected from you, Felix.  The other weakness of the Euronationalists – which they share with the magatards – is ultrazionism and the bogeyman of antisemitism. I’ve seen/read of it in TommyRobinson, Geert Wilders, etc. The Aussies have gone so far as to begin testing all the black/brown/yellow wannabe paperwesterners to ensure they have positive opinions of Joos.  Until people genuinely confront and accept what nationalism and ‘people’ is inreality, the political game will continue as usual.

                Yes. Every “nationalist” party in Europe is certified controlled opposition, with the possible exception of Golden Dawn in Greece.And every time one of them gets enough votes to be forced to shit or get off the can (like what’s happening to Farage right now) a new “nationalist” party is there, ready to pick up the vote. (Like the Homeland Party is doing right now.)In 2015 the Danish People’s Party was voted into a position that gave them the keys to the prime minister’s office – despite the worst efforts of the party leadership who had exiled their biggest vote magnet to Brussels, and refused to use immigration in their election campaign.So the DPP leadership simply decided nah, we’re not going to do that. We’re going to stay out of government because that’s how you get real political influence. Then, only a few weeks after the election, hordes of Merkel’s guests of honor started crossing the Danish border with impunity and the government closed off the Danish motorways so the police could escort them safely to the welfare office.And the DPP didn’t utter a peep. Since then, the Danish natpop vote has been destroyed, with a fat, ugly, hysterical, Israel-loving, Koran-burning one-man retard-show being offered up as the new alternative for patriotic Danes.And even if Trump is for real, what happens next? His designated heir is a curry-burning neocon rentboy who wears his wife’s kohl to work.

                    …fat, ugly, hysterical, Israel-loving, Koran-burning one-man retard-show…I forgot “grooming underage boys online”, reading them stories about a schoolboy who gets violently dildo-raped by his teacher in front of his class, instructing them in shaving their genitals and telling them stuff like “I’m naked right now, and my giant dick keeps bumping into the furniture.”It’s literally on tape and published by a major newspaper, but for some reason, this guy who we’re supposed to think is the biggest threat to democracy since Uncle Adolf, is being gladhanded by the establishment, invited to debates in DenMarx Radio like a real politician, the grooming never mentioned but that one time.Meanwhile, we have some mainstream guy caught with child porn on his harddrive a few days ago, and he’s getting the full broadside.

                The Aussies have gone so far as to begin testing all the black/brown/yellow wannabe paper westerners to ensure they have positive opinions of Joos.I was unaware of this parodic loyalty test, and I have strong ties to Australia and try to keep abreast of developments there. I won’t write it is “unbelievable,” because it certainly is believable, but it is beyond pathetic even by today’s low standards. In essence, the Tribe is demanding that Australia continue to be invaded but only by those loyal to Our Greatest Ally. The expulsion of naughty Palestinian students from the US for the offense of trashing Israel, pathetic in its own right, at least has the upside of getting a handful of foreigners out.

When they want to take rights away from you, they always start with the Mohammadans – that way you won’t complain until it’s too late.

                        They don’t need or seek a predicate for anything any longer, Felix. Basically every civil and constitutional right was stripped during Covid, and as far as I know Muslims weren’t bothered with a lockdown/mandatory vaccination regime beforehand. As to censorship in particular, federal agents were doing it with gusto to Heritage Americans for years. Granted, Mohammadians might have been censored as well, but no excuse was needed or offered to do it to the natives. As White America’s percentage continues to decline, look for examples to be made of the Heritage populace with increasing frequency and intensity. The days of using/needing a scapegoat to implement something like the Patriot Act have come and gone.

                            You still have quite a lot of free speech left, de jure if not always de facto. Holocaust Denial springs to mind, a natural corollary to banning anti-Semitism.
And the Mohammadan demonstrators conveniently offered their ass up for slapping. I have no idea what I’m talking about, but I figure most Normie Americans are good and well fed up with noisy “students” waving foreign flags.

                                Yes, there’s a lot of free speech left, but the Constitution lovin’ Republicans are earning their shekels by trying to ban anti-Semitic speech here, too. As far as the Pali protestors, they more or less have been media memoryholed, but, again, any pretext to deport is perfectly fine. Normie Americans are indeed fed up because they have been told they are told they fed up despite the disappearance of any images or mentions of the people who they have been told caused them to be fed up.

                        “When they want to take rights away from you, they always start with the Mohammadans – that way you won’t complain until it’s too late.”This concept is straight of the Jews playbook about supposed oppression. This stifling thought, that rulers will be unable to make future meaningful distinctions is about making sure the Jews are never differiated enough for country what, 105?Mohammadans are hardly model citizens anyway just to begin with, even in their home countries. Historically, they are the conquerors, who stuck around for centuries. When Spain did move them out, the Christian citizens (or their sympathetic agnostics) had full control. They did not come after the comfortable majority.In any event, making the Joos a sacred cow, never to be blamephemed has required a great deal of cooperation from the masses. They have been the enforcers of this taboo. It’s already starting to breakdown. Thus the elites are getting nervous.

                        IIRC AmRen began to use volunteer comment moderators, who took the task waay too seriously.  They think they are doing “God’s work”,  but they’re not.  All they were doing was being the “nice police” in the commentary section.  Of course, what is nice depends on the moderator.Thus, the AmRen commentary became worthless and half the reason to read articles in the blog vanished.  If their moderators and policy came over to this blog, half the discussion/exchange would immediately end.  Jared Tayler hasn’t a clue as to how much audience he has lost with his “play nice” policy.  As much as I respect Taylor, he is the main reason for his lack of effectiveness for the cause of White unity.  His “play nice” is directed to an audience (both White and non-White) where it is least effective.

                        OK, read the article. Wow. When I saw that forcing the invaders not to be anti-Semitic represented “Australian values” I chuckled because it is true.* There was no need to leave a comment on your behalf because others had done the dirty deed far better than I could have. The comments themselves were eye-opening because AmRen is Zion Central. The readership, at least, have taken The Last Redpill.*About ten years ago on a return visit I reunited with an elderly friend who was a World War II vet. The Japanese came very close to an Australian invasion several times and had bombed northern cities. My now-late friend and former co-worker had fought the Japs tooth and nail in New Guinea jungles. As we finished dinner he told me that he had picked up an extraordinary book about WWII, so I naturally thought it was about Port Moresby or whatever.No, it was about the Holocaust.

        I was reading about what happened at the Jimmy Carter funeral last night. Karen Pence snubbed the Trumps and so did the Bushes, but Trump was chummy with Zero. I guess Michael Obama and Karen Pence didn’t attend the inauguration festivities, either.Karen Pence must be butt hurt that her husband has been frozen out. Or, maybe the rumors about him being a pedo are true and she’s bitter that she got stuck with one. I don’t like the guy simply because he can’t give a straight answer to the most simple question. He always tries to tap dance around anything he is asked.No point to all this other than that it showing that Trump is way outnumbered among the ruling class. Unless a MAGAt follows Trump as President, we probably return to business as usual. We will need several successive terms to break the deep state. We will also need some quick improvement from the new economic paradigm. Otherwise, again, back to business as usual.One other point and that’s how Bush snubbed Trump. I wonder what the Bushes must be thinking to know that they are incredibly unpopular even among their own voters. George Bush is the Jimmy Carter or Mikhail Gorbachev of the Republican Party. I’d love to have him called out and have to answer publicly, under oath, for the debacle he created in Iraq, which is the Genesis for all the dislike of W. All of his presidential flaws became magnified after that.(Incidentally, I am a “MAGAt.” I guess I should find that term offensive, but I find it amusing.)

            It’s debatable if Trump and The Precious were actually chummy. Many have noted that laughing when challenged is an old habit of his.

            I’d like to think that Bush is incredibly unpopular, but I think he has enough boomer repuke support and new luv amongst the left (feminist airhead wife and daughters) that he could still get elected to office.  Never underestimate people’s stupidity.  Either way, the POS has plenty of $ – like the rest of them – so isn’t particularly worried about the future of his grandchildren in a non-White world.  He should be, but he isn’t.

                So how rich do you have to be to tolerate/accept having half caste children when your offspring marry out of race?  How rich do you have to be when your full blood Hindu in-laws drop by to celebrate Christmas with you.  What the hell would you celebrate anyway?  Do we hang ornaments upon the many arms of Shiva?  What stories do you read to your grandchildren when they go to bed at night.  Do we read from the “Bhagavad Gita“ or “Snow White”?It’s not even a chapter from “Brave New World”.  It’s a horror story of a dystopian world of confused/mixed cultures.

It’s bizarre. . .even if he’s a social retard his family could have set him up with any number of white debutantes in their circle.

                The normies still love him. My aunt loved Jeb. (Of course, she has slipped into dementia so she might not have been thinking straight.) What’s that old saying about shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves and three or four generations? The Bushes are never going to be in shirt sleeves, but they sure have wrecked the family business.W may have wrecked the family business, but I guess you never know. They may rise again from the dead. It’ll be hard to do, though.W should have been smarter than to let himself get suckered into going into Iraq. All of his other deficiencies would have been overlooked or at least downplayed if he hadn’t have done that. Iraq and Trump calling him out for it broke him.

That’s how Karen and Mike met, but now they are evangelicals. I’m guessing they didn’t have enough pull for Karen to have permission to remarry. (She’s divorced.)

                    When they are working well, annulment tribunals do not grant annulments based on celebrity status or how badly they want one. Celebs can “shop around” dioceses. For the most part though, if there’s a Christian marriage with children particularly, annulments are not granted.

        “Nigel Farage is an entertaining political clown whose main role is to prevent any sort of organized resistance to the nation-wrecking policies of the UK political class.”Couldn’t you make the same argument about Trump?  2016 felt like when you work for a corporation and they need to make changes so they send out an email to employees asking you which would you least dislike?  Bernie and Trump, well Bernie was not acceptable so we got Trump who is, and the rest is WWE.  Just a thought.  Both parties in America should have been relegated to the dustbin of history, yet they both still hold the tiger by the ears.

        The old colonial powers, mainly Britain and France, siphoned vast amounts of wealth from their conquests..e.g. India and China went from the wealthiest countries in the world to virtually the poorest in 200 years..The US actually did the reverse, expending trillions reconstructing and defending  Europe..So the Europeans became very wealthy house slaves, not field slaves being worked to death..The transition to field slaves in the next ten years is going to be brutal….

            “…e.g. India and China went from the wealthiest countries in the world to virtually the poorest in 200 years…”Really?  Or are we conflating the rise of the West via the IR, with a stagnation of those two countries mired in socialism, i.e., communism?.India for example after GB left experimented with socialism, ala USSR precepts, for decades.  China similarly until Mao died and after a couple of government transitions, decided to use a limited/controlled capitalism to its benefit, i.e., “To be rich is glorious!”China of course has caught up and surpassed the West in a brief 40 years.  India, not as centrally controlled, has done quite well nevertheless itself during that time.  I don’t see where the West had much negatively to do with anything, albeit such a narrative is spouted by Leftists all the time to debase the West’s development model.  That is to say, we deserve our prosperity *not* as it is many derived from pillage of other countries.

        It is the difference between a ruling class and an administrative class. If a class exercising power (coercion and persuasion: police, education, media, etc) over a population through both governmental and private institutions has no power to make changes to the structure of their civilization (ex trade, foreign, industrial, immigration policies) then they merely administrate, but do not rule. An administrative class, with veneer of legitimacy provided by the theatre of ‘democracy’, exercises power over the population it governs, but itself has power exercised over it (through coercion and persuasion) by an actual ruling class which makes decisions regarding civilizational architecture which are then implemented by the administrative class.It’s why President Trump elicited such wild resistance to the incredibly tepid reforms he was attempting during his first term. His reforms, as modest as they were, were in the realm of civilizational architecture (gutting NAFTA and TPP), and thus the actual ruling class (who view the President and Congress as their administrative class employees) saw him as encroaching upon their prerogatives. He decided, then implemented, instead of them deciding and him implementing their decisions. This established a precedent the globalists who rule America wanted utterly erased. They used to own both parties and thus were used to always having reliable employees to carry out their will.We are living through what is essentially a planetwide civil war amongst the International Jews. Once can abstract them into 5 groups. Individuals and institutions may be associated with more than one group. Think of the whole as a set of five overlapping/intersecting networks in a sort of cartel-like arrangement.The first is centered about the institutions that manufacture the fiat currency ‘Euro’ and inject them into the financial system that mediates economic activity in much of Europe. The second is centered about the institutions that manufacture the fiat currency ‘American Dollar’ and inject them into the financial system that mediates economic activity in the US and much of the rest of the world directly and indirectly through its use as the reserve currency for international trade. The third faction focuses on support for Israel nationalism and includes Israel (obviously) and the various Zionist (Zionism is Jewish nationalism) networks in the West like AIPAC whose primary objective is the health of the Jewish national homeland. The fourth is comprised of genocidally anti-European and anti-Christian activists whose primary objective is the destruction of European polities as prelude to the destruction of European national peoples. This faction was the driving force behind the Biden administration. The fifth faction is comprised of those Jews who think that integration into European national peoples is the way to best ensure a stable future. Eric Zemmour in France and Stephen Miller in America are well known and politically consequential examples.European leadership, whether elected via fake democracy or neoliberal democracy (defined as democracy where policy outcomes and will of the national people are completely uncorrelated) like Emmanuel Macron in France or Keir Starmer in UK or appointed like Ursala von der Leyen in the EU, are administrative hired help for the first€-centric faction. They are mostly incompetent and unused to exercising actual power that does not involve repressing and harvesting their own populations. Faction 1 leadership has been unable to provide winning strategic direction for the war against rebellious Russia and their administrative-class European servants are too incompetent to bridge the gap.President Trump has brokered an alliance of sort with Factions 3 (Israel-first) and 5 (integration), while attempting to resuscitate the Global American Empire to mollify Faction 2. Factions 1 and 4 have essentially been designated as enemies.While he may have personal interests exceeding this, political reality is that alliance with Factions 3 and 5 (especially 3) provide a sort of sociopolitical inoculation against charges of antisemitism that are invariably deployed by Factions 1,2, and 4 against any who oppose them. It’s why those who oppose globalist destruction of their national peoples like Victor Orban of Hungary or Tommy Robinson of England so often publicly support Israel.What does this mean for Europe? The administrative class of Europe owes its continued existence, as individuals grifting at the public trough, to serving €-centric Faction 1. Their fates are,by design, intertwined. Any leadership challenge that works within the system must break through the barriers of fake democracy to supplant and replace the administrative class. This has been increasingly happening and as a result the tools of assassination (Fico most recently, but many others) and electoral fraud (arbitrary invalidation of candidacy) have been deployed with increasing regularity, which hastens the delegitimization of the entire system.What plans with associated capability to implement said plans, does the leadership of Faction 1 have? Their ability to compete with Faction 2 outside of Europe is decaying at the same time their control over the national government constituents of their EU empire is fraying. While the war in Ukraine originated as a multi-faction effort, it appears at this point that Faction 1 is the driving force behind continued support of a doomed effort. The primary objective of European nationalists must be to avoid getting dragged into it.

            I think this is a bit convoluted, but at least it mentions them. What I think Z is missing, perhaps deliberately, is that the Europeans are indeed slaves, but not to America, rather to Rothschild/Soros. America is just the vehicle of empire, as the British were before.
Personally, I identify 3 overlapping factions, not five: Neoliberal, Neoconservative and Zionist, although there are sub-factions. Where to put Zemmour, Miller and perhaps Unz is difficult. Possibly self-hating or cryptos? The position on legal immigration is usually the tell.
Just don’t turn your back.

        Forgive me if it has been talked about in the past, but the notion that “They would rather be hacked to death by a machete wielding African than taste freedom”.

            There are folks who are fine with their daughters being murdered by illegal immigrants, and would rather see the murderers go free than be thought a racist.
Like-wise, the Euros seem fine with muslims and blacks getting all stabby.  I don’t see Euros pushing back against the barbarian hordes, but rather meekly going along with even more savagery.
It’s a deep seated cultural defect at this point:  All the good men were killed off in the two great industrial wars.

        there’s a lot of ruin left in the countries of Western Europe. NO change possible until their economies can no longer support welfare rolls. Social welfare is the societal sedative that keeps everything in order. Third world immigration has overwhelmed all Western European countries, its too far gone to reverse.

        Aside from the psychological effect of 80 years of American hegemony, the Europeans also have a strong fear of Russia. I noted this when even Orban in Hungary (not an admirer of the EU) came out strongly against the Russian attack. America has been the bulwark of Europe’s defense against Russia, first in its Soviet phase and now in the present Russian nationalist phase. I think this fear is irrational but yet it exists.

        Yes, Europe is ruled by a bunch of faggy clowns and girlbosses right now, but it may not always be thus – and this is the flaw in Putin’s thinking.He should know better: less than two years elapsed before the creaky Soviet armies crumbling during Operation Barbarossa dealt Germany the mortal blow at Stalingrad, with the Red Army henceforth proving itself to be the most fearsome land force on earth, backed by a vast, well-organized empire.Something similar could happen in Europe. All it takes is one person – like a Napoleon, who was unique for his (or any) time – and things can turn around fast. And Russia would be faced with a mighty, rearmed and remilitarized Germany, this time undistracted by wars with other Europeans and backed by 400 million of them.

            For such a figure to emerge, he would need to have a sufficient mass of followers. I’m not seeing it from the “right.” Hypothetically the reigning German regime could pull off something similar if it attempted to militarize. Which would require millions of German baizuo willing to take up arms to defend clown world. Technically possible, but hard to picture. But look at Canada (part of Europe spiritually if not geographically). Sudden upswell of clown world nationalism as a manifestation of TDS. If it could happen there, it could happen in Germany too.

                Yep. If you are going to go back in history to such figures as Napoleon, then you are looking at a time of Kings and Queens and rule of the aristocracy. It is upon this background that such leaders could rise and rule a country. After a century of divisive “democracy”, such ability of any individual to rise and take power seems unlikely.

            Western Evrope isadministeredby faggy clowns and girlbosses. One by one, the old countries will come to be administered by Muhammadists, humanzees, and pajeets. The ruling class will remain basically the same. Same process applies to Canada and the USA, except with more many more Han and a few other east Asians competing for admin roles. Stupid “White” people will be their farmers, except for a few degenerates living urbanly among the administrators and imagining that they are an avante garde of progress.
