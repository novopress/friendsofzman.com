        Z Man, thank you, again, for another brilliant podcast. And I look forward to hearing you on RamZPaul’s show tomorrow! Forgive me for gushing, but I need to say, God bless you for your marvelous mind, terrific thoughts, articulate utterances, technical prowess and beautiful, beautiful soul. Forgive me further for getting personal here, but I want to say that I pray you travel to eastern Europe, take a young chaste white wife who loves you madly, get married and make lots of beautiful, smart little Z babies! You are just a wonderful soul and I so wish the world for you and hope that our world may be increasingly filled with little Z Men and good, smart souls like Z Man’s. Thank you and may God bless you as He has blessed me with your illuminated thoughts. Many, many times over. Wishing a very merry Christmas to all the thoughtful commenters here, the best around as far as I’m concerned, and I’ve seen many blogs. Wishing all of you peace, love, and happiness. With gratitude.

        Merry Christmas, or whatever, Zman. And at the risk of sounding like a fangirl you’re one of the few people I can read or listen to seriously anymore.

Not sure how I missed Zman over the years but glad that I found him. We’re living in increasingly interesting times. Zman is as good a guide as you’ll find as to why we’re here and maybe ever where we’re going. Thanks Zman.
And Merry Christmas.

        Men marry women for looks.
Women marry men for money.
Professional women—the herterosexual psychologically normal ones that is— are usually unmarried because a woman does not respect a man who makes less money than herself.

        It does appear someone said something to sting the Donald’s awareness after Ann dissed him. like how did  “Read my lips: no new taxes” work out for George 1?  Because that is exactly how fumbling that issue is going to play out. That test is a proxy for all others because if you can’t do that you can’t do anything, like, say, end the practice of hate whitey show trials in your own Justice Department.

        You’re wise to avoid Paris right now. I’d suggest Rome. The food is just as good and the city is about as interesting to us history buffs as any place on earth. Merry Christmas!

        Well,Z onward and upward like a hot air balloon.  Your star is rising and you have the women folk hot, bothered and looking to bump into you in the grocery store. “Oh my God, it must be him!”  Good thing I’m not 30 years younger or you wouldn’t be able to resist my big……brain!Thank you VERY MUCH for all your time, thought and effort to share your musings and educate us.  Because of you, damn it, I have been red pilled, my eyes pried open with toothpicks as in Clockwork Orange, and there’s no going back. My understanding, my ideology, my beliefs are changing by the week. Damn it. After enlightenment comes the laundry.Merry Christmas and have a great time decompressing! Pet the cat. Oh. what kind of a wild breed cat owns you, and how is his behavior different than a domestic breed? He may be the next cat boy for me.We all look forward to the refreshed Z writing in the new year!

        I wish I could remember who wrote this because honestly I can’t even imagine anyone writing it today. Within a day afterTrump was elected somebody wrote an article questioning whether or not they were the weirdly dressed bad guys people from Capitol in The Hunger Games and had the good guys from the district’s  just won. It was striking for its solitary moment of self-awareness that I never saw again. Does anyone else remember that?

        Z Man, on the Flynn thing, I think there is a bit more to it. The judge, Sullivan, has a track record of calling out prosecutorial misconduct, e.g., the Ted Steven case. He repeatedly asked Flynn if he wanted to withdraw is guilty plea for lying to the FBI, and many speculate that he believes that charge is a setup.The problem for Flynn (and for the judge) is that Flynn (and his son) have no immunity for the other charges that Horse Face is holding over his head, so if he withdraws the plea (or the judge throws it out) Flynn could be in much bigger danger. (The other charges, related to FARA disclosure violations, though technically crimes, are typically handled with fines and amended filings.)Now, while the Conservative Treehouse guys think that Sullivan wants to help Flynn, it is also possible he is just playing with his food before eating it. That said, it is clear that he is signaling to Horse Face that he knows how naughty the prosecution/persecution of Flynn is

                Schama is a famous historian, but he is also an obnoxious globalist shitlib. I haven’t read any of his books, so I can’t say whether that colours his views on French Revolution too much, but it’s always good to know something about the author of a historical study you are reading. After all, there is no such thing as objective history, and historians tend to use the study of the past to say something about the present.If you want to know how intolerably smug this twat is, I recommend to watch this video, where Mark Steyn puts him in his place in a debate:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zHoDANH-R8
