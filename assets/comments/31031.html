        Wikipedia changed the early life on Abramovic, which said she’s Jewish on November 4, 2016 and changed it to Serbian.  (unable to link the wiki page, says it’s “spam,” unfortunately.

        I reverse;
I saw a comment musing whether Hamas set the trap, putting out the bait.
Just now, on WRSA Escobar says Russia and Iran set the trap!

        Super OT
I had to share, as when I came across this incident, I laughed out loud.
Per Heyjackass.com, 15 people (and folks), were shot this morning at 1:00AM, at Roosevelt and Pulaski in Chimpcongo, one of the many armpits in the city.
The number of individuals actually kilt?
None.
Ghettofabulous shooting at its finest!

            There’s a difference between shooting to kill and shooting to shoot. Ghetto drivebys are a performative display, not a military operation.

James Alex Fields Jr. only managed to kill one. I guess Whites are ineffective drivers.

        The problem with the current mid/dis/mal information crusade is that the conspiracy theorists are on a 5 year winning streak.  Among other things, the CT’s have been proven right about…– Clinton’s emails– Ed Snowden really was on to something– the Russia investigation was a hoax to overthrow Trump– Ukraine impeachment was a cover up for Biden taking bribes– COVID originating in a lab in China– and Anthony Fauci paid for it– and the vaccine has deadly side effects and doesn’t work– illegals really are about demographic replacement– Hunters laptop was real, the information on it is real bad, and US government employees covered it all up to rig an election– CRT = DIE and both are explicitly anti-white– US Government employees were encouraging, and in many cases directing and laying for, direct censorship of American citizensAnd on and on…Covering up truthful things by calling them disinformation doesn’t work out in the long run.

        Off Topic:  David Cole gives his view of the proper response of the dissident right to the Israel-Palestine conflict.  As usual, his main theme is that the dissident right sabotages itself when it criticizes the ch0s3n.https://www.takimag.com/article/white-knighting-for-middle-east-unsalvageables/His argument is that if you support Hamas in the Middle East, then you are morally obligated to support blacks and Amerindians in the USA, because all are failed peoples.  Further, if you want to cut foreign aid to Israel, then you are obligated to spend that money on reparations for blacks.  He says:“And if you’re a rightist who’s obsessed with defending the Palis, well…if you believe that foreign aid money is better spent at home, so’s your “empathy,” Cletus. Help our failed people. Help get justice for the nonwhite folks here who were dominated by their betters.  Gr0yp3rs for Slavery Reparations!”If you don’t follow his prescription, then you are inconsistent, and he knows that whites are the only people on earth who are troubled if they are called inconsistent.I believe the proper response to Cole demonstrates the kind of shift in thinking that our side must make.  We must change our highest commitments from abstractions to whatever actions best support traditional white people.My response to Cole:  Treating similar peoples similarly is not a great concern of mine.  My highest principle is defending traditional whites and supporting their flourishing.Although both the ch0s3n and the musl1ms are threats to my people, the ch0s3n are a thousand-fold the greater threat.  Therefore, I support what hurts them and takes away their time and energy from persecuting my people.

            So if I do not support Hamas then can I support the genocide of blacks and amerindians?
To know who rules over you, just find out who you cannot criticize.

            This seems to be a fairly consistent method of attack the juice are using against dissidents who don’t support their genocide.  The thing they miss is the fact that the dissident right has consistently stated that brown people indeed have a right to exist in their own parts of the world, as opposed to the strawman the enemy has of us where we want to perform sadistic medical experiments on anyone who isn’t a 6’5″ blonde superman.Observe how the Jews alter their messaging to try and sucker every faction into being on their side.  They sidle up to the DR with this nationalist stuff when it’s for Israel, but for the cuckservatives they have a song and dance about how Islamofascists hate America’s freedom to have porno and diabetes.  Then for the shitlibs they convince them that the browns are like cute rescue dogs that need a new home, in Europe and the US.

            “As usual, his main theme is that the dissident right sabotages itself when it criticizes the ch0s3n”Nope. His main theme is that the Palestinians need to accept that they lost the war and get on with improving their lives. Whether or not to criticize Israel is never mentioned. The only domestic Jew mentioned is a judge who hired a Palestinian clerk, now a rich lawyer who refused comment on her transition away from being a college Pali activist. No Israeli Jews get a mention either.“His argument is that if you support Hamas in the Middle East, then you are morally obligated to support blacks and Amerindians in the USA, because all are failed peoples.”Nope. He makes no such moral claim. In your quote he doesn’t say HE advocates “Help[ing] get justice for the nonwhite folks here who were dominated by their betters”. Indeed you recognize that that is what he is saying, but then you pull the claim that HE is advocating that position out of your ass.I assumed you were lying about what he said or that your take was idiotic and indeed it was.

        Having the “right kind” of protein is a thing in the sense that you want the ratio of amino acids consumed to be the same as the ratio in the tissue you’re trying to repair and build.  The thing is all animal protein is perfectly sufficient in that regard, it’s only a problem for vegans trying to get protein from their potato chips and snacky cakes.

            Yes. Most of the American public will fall for it again.   If we survive, in a few years it will be more than obvious this was a set up.  The reason Israel was chosen as the springboard this time is that it still tugs at the heart strings of stupid Americans.   They couldn’t get anyone to care about their wars anyplace else at this point.My guess would be that Iran after joining BRICS will quickly become a much greater power.   In their new economic alliance they would become immune to the West’s sanctions.  So they want to prevent that from happening.The neocons must strike now or the combination of a strengthening Iran and a weakening U.S. will preclude action in the near future.   So they think.  In actuality the U.S. is, at this point, probably much weaker than they think.   These people suffer greatly from delusion and arrogant over confidence.

        Did the Shah plan on accepting something other than dollars in payment for oil?Or has the 40 years of sanctions and bomb-bomb-Iran not been working, because the ayatollahs have been doing that all along?  Betraying those who placed them there, in other words.If so, then the Ukraine gambit  has strained US finances enough we’ve finally got to pull the trigger and rope the ayatollahs in, before the BRICS start breaking away en masse.My conjecture, if correct, would mean the neocon bankers are operating under what has become a traditional belief in their class;that is, that they can attack any breakaways from their banking system without undue repercussions.

            That is about the size of it.  Iran by joining BRICS as well as their geographic location means they will be impervious to their sanctions.   If Iran is destroyed it will also mean that Russia is more boxed in and will not have access to the Gulf via Iran.

            It seems the neocon bankers fear they can’t afford to let up. While Russia and China probably fear they can’t afford to let Iran fall. So they’re playing nuclear chicken, both sides believing they have to win. Seems we’re in a bit of a fix

            Right now, there’s an yuge thread at /pol/, here in the wee hours of Saturday morning, East Coast time, wherein israhe11is in Gaza are looking at a mess akin to Ukraine [which is a mess akin to Verdun, which is a mess akin to Gettysburg, etc etc etc].

                    Alzaebo, /pol/ always starts with a “temporary” thread at 4chan, then that temporary thread vanishes, and you have to go over to 4plebs for the permanent archive of the thread.You can only poast on the original “temporary” thread at 4chan, but that poasting is then permanently archived at 4plebs.Note that there is a slight variance in the URL syntax at 4chan versus 4plebs.TEMPORARY:https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/446677407/PERMANENT:https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/446677407/Also, in order to poast on a temporary thread, you’ll need to go to a convenience store, purchase with [untraceable] cash a VISA gift card, in the amount of maybe $25 to $30 [to account for usurious fees], and that will get you a 4chan Pass which allows poasting:https://tinyurl.com/3dkbfwb3It also helps if you have a fake email address [which, these days, tends to require the aforementioned untraceable paper cash money plus the aforementioned VISA gift card plus an untraceable burner SIM card for your phone].

        The managerial class cares about “disinformation” because they are the purveyors of it and they don’t want anything true to spread among the proles.  If something is true, but interferes with or contradicts “the narrative,” it’s disinformation.  Think about all the media taken off of different parts of the internet because they told the truth about a specific subject, like race and table 43. They even discontinued table 43 because it’s racist and gives people the false impression that a certain group of people is responsible for 52% of the murders.  Snopes has become a meme.  Murders in South Africa are a “White supremacist conspiracy theory!”  Voter fraud is a conspiracy theory. Let’s not forget about the attack on “our democracy” by those evil maga-terrorists who committed the largest insurrection in our history.  Or how a specific day in July was the hottest in 20k years. There are thousands of examples.There was a major fire in Luton airport in one of the parking garages. It started with a battery/diesel hybrid Rover. There is footage from the beginning of the fire with this Rover on fire. Oh, coincidence of coincidence, the fire is burning brightly right where the battery is on the hybrid version of the vehicle.  Plus, there is little to no visible black smoke. You simply cannot get pool of diesel to burn in the open air without producing copious amounts of black smoke from incomplete combustion.  But with all the EV fires everywhere, they didn’t want to give EVs yet another large fire. So they just said “It’s a diesel Rover”The top tiers of the media are so good at lying and spreading disinformation that they can lie without telling any easily verifiable lies. This is largely accomplished through framing, narrative and sources.

            Tars Tarkas: “The top tiers of the media are so good at lying and spreading disinformation that they can lie without telling any easily verifiable lies. This is largely accomplished through framing, narrative and sources.”The glue which holds it all together is the Hive Mind of the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex.Passive Aggressives are born with an innate sense of what the Hive Mind requires of them, and understand instinctually the role they are required to perform at any particular moment in time, and during any particular crisis which threatens the Hive Mind.You can’t analyze Managerialism or the Deep State or Cabal***  until you adopt the point of view of an insect colony.Then it all starts to make sense.==========***Anonymous Conservative’s terminology for the phenomenon.

                        Sorry, I wish I had had the chance to reply to you earlier in the day [you’ll probably never see my reply here], but the point is not that kneegr0wz are not thieves – everyone knows that kneegr0wz are thieves – and that “shrink” [kneegr0w theft] is a very real phenomenon.The point is that the Passive Aggressives [typically j00ish retailers] are using kneegr0w theft to cover up all sorts Passive Aggressive behavior on their own part, such as stealing from their own businesses, and then dumping the ostensible losses on the backs of the goyische insurance companies.[Have you ever wondered why j00z don’t create their own insurance companies? Why it’s always the goyim who have to cover the losses in the various societal disasters?]As the j00 Rahm Emanuel proclaimed, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.”And j00ish retailers are not gonna let a gift like kneegr0w “shrink” go untended.If nothing else, knowing necessarily that there will be “shrink” in their businesses, they can short their own stocks, and laugh all the way to the bank [which of course they also own].They can even use shrink to make the value of their real estate appear to plummet to zero, re-purchase that real estate at its nadir, and again laugh all the way to the bank when a new round of gentrification causes real estate prices to surge again [have you ever wondered why your county’s zoning commission is dominated by j00z?].They are almost infinitely many ways in which a Passive Aggressive can use lawfare &amp; economic warfare to profit in almost any possible situation.And I’m not even in the bidness; I have only an amateur’s knowledge of all the tricks the Passive Aggressives have up their sleeves.

        I don’t know about comet pizza, but Pizzagate had at least some truth to it.  The Spirit cooking woman (Marina Abramović.) is VERY real and her “art” is very real. I can’t remember the source, but I just recently saw video of a spirit cooking party.  All of it is around sexuality of children and other perversions (life sized cakes of dead humans among the party favor paraphernalia.). She really was/is hosting “spirit cooking parties” for top democrats (it came to light from their emails planning them). Just search her name and art.What a coincidence, the elite just happen to want to sexualize children in public libraries and public schools. They’re putting pornography in school libraries all across the country.  Drag queen parties for children. Drag queen story hour in libraries.Anyone who does not view these people with complete suspicion is a fool. I don’t know about child sacrifice in the basement of Comet Pizza, but there is something going on.  The whole culture turned on a dime. Something that was absolutely unthinkable and a serious felony crime that would get you killed in prison just a few years ago is now mainstream family friendly fun.

            An overlooked characteristic of real psychos, “sexual sadist serial killers” and such, is that outside their criminal specialties, which are deeply motivated and *true*, their performance of transgression is corny and theatrical.Manson’s forehead swastika comes to mind. Everyone understands, even if they lie about it, that he wasn’t a nazi. He wasn’t intellectually capable of understanding what one was. But he was an instinctive one-on-one intimidator who knew that carving their logo between his eyes would make him look like trouble—trouble as seen on TV.Or Ted Bundy. In real life, high in the mountain woods, in the absolute dark, miles from anyone but distant highway drivers, alone with a corpse for hours, he was outside all but the most extreme human experience. Theatrically, in court defending himself with amateur overacting or in the interrogation room whining that porn made him do it, he was an underwritten fiction.We’re not ruled by dark satanic pedophiles who do awesome horror shit. We are ruled by child rapists and *child rapist groupies* who are bound to each other not least by a shared childish aesthetic sense—by what they thought looked scary when their development was arrested.They do evil by necessity (or at least compulsion). They make “evil” displays because they’re stupid babies.

                Dunno where you get that idea.
Wikipedia:”Early life, education and teachingAbramović was born in Belgrade, Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, on November 30, 1946…. Her great-uncle was Varnava, Serbian Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church.[7][8] … Abramović was raised by her grandparents until she was six years old.[10] Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramović “spent [her] childhood in a church following [her] grandmother’s rituals—candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions”.[10] ”
That’s “church” and “Patriarch”/”priest”, not “synagogue” and “rabbi”.

            It is remarkable what they’re saying openly. More than half of Canada’s cabinet belongs to this murky situation?? That sounds extremely important to me. But not to MSM I guess.Now this might be squirrels going nuts in my head but the WEF is so open that they sometimes seem like they must be either a decoy or a place to float insane globalist ideas. Who’s more in control, Klaus Schwab or Larry Fink? And who calls them to an interview without coffee? The real power relations are really opaque. Mapping them would be interesting but probably impossible from open sources

                It’s very clear that Klaus (and whoever is handling him) wants him to be seen. Factor in that the MSM pretty well ignores him but he’s all over “dissident” media, and then consider that “dissident” media is to a great extent just as controlled as other media, and you can infer that “they” want dissidents to see him. Kind of like how “they” want dissidents to see it when the old geezer in Utah gets killed, or the tiki torch marchers get prosecuted, two other stories that were all over “dissident” media but the MSM mostly ignored. Many more examples.“They” want us to see Klaus

        The vast majority of information in the public square, at least the “official” public square is either misinformation or disinformation. It’s not just political stuff either. It is every single subject under the sun that gets discussed in the public square.  Now today, large amounts of what is presented as news is just flat out made up. Doesn’t exist at all. Many of the news sites I visit have “stories” on the page that are presented as stories that will be of interest to the reader of the story you are reading.  But, in fine print that you have to scroll to get to disclaims that it’s “sponsored content”  Worse, once you click on it, you can’t get back. It just sits there and takes your browser forward and forward without you clicking any link.  When you hit the back button, you’re still on the page.If you pay attention, you will often find the same exact verbiage on almost every site covering a story.  Sometimes it comes from official sources, like the White House and other times it comes from the “style guide” put out by rags like the NYT or the AP.The problem is, the press decided a long time ago that the purpose of the press was not to inform, but to persuade the public   When you view your job to persuade the public of something, you become an advocate. Advocates are not bound by facts and do not want you to draw your own conclusions about anything.

        Comet Pizza: The most interesting thing about that buzz was how vigorously it was suppressed by the MSM. I’ve never followed Mike Cernovich. In fact, I always have to look him up after you mention him to be sure who he is. But I maintain that from what I could gather, there was something there. There are people who really got into that particular “tinfoil hat” theorizing and after a while my standard reply was, ‘Yes, but you’ll never know the real story. It will all be contained.’ I remember that bimbo blonde Megan Kelly interviewed I think it was the owner of Comet Pizza and it was obvious what was going on. Suppress the story however possible.Figure out who or what you can’t talk about and you’ll understand who rules over you. That’s a truism that stands the test of time. But I do understand that there’s bigger fish to fry than a bunch of pedo’s in government. That fact had already been well established by the time Comet Pizza blew up. The name Dennis Hastert comes to mind. If and when the DR ever gains power, there will still be a bunch of pedo’s within the fold. Whether there were panicked emergency meetings within the ‘halls of power’ with that particular episode is the only question and we’ll probably never know.

            Yeah there seemed to be a vigorous effort to cast the conspiracy to the pizza place rather than the fact that they were discussing child porn and jut usingCometPizza as code.  When parsing those Leon Panetta emails an effort has to be made to read anything else into them.

            That owner, Alefantis, (I remember his name being something like this because of its resemblance to Enfant) instagram archive is completely packed with referenced to horrific innuendo. Then you read those Podesta emails. Read the emails about Dominos on cheese, the Pizza related napkin, the Beanie Baby ones, etc., and tell me that those circle don’t traffic kids. Just look up the artwork Molesta decorates his house with.Then one starts going down the rabbit hole, where you read of such things as the Seekers and their CIA connections. Horrific stuff. This country is rotten to its core. Couple this with their love of Satanism (Crowley and that Marie Abromivich (sp?) spirit dinner whatever woman who was just appointed an envoy TO UKRAINE!), and I have no doubt they abuse and sacrifice children. Hell, look at the Dutroux affair, clearly touching upon the elites. Wickedness. And it makes me hate the populace that permits it and the media that obscures it. Horrendous evil.

                    Except that Comet Pizza does, in fact, have a basement. Alefantis is on record in a news article from a year or two before the story broke that they store their fresh ingredients in a cooled store room in the basement of the shop.

                        I congratulate you for successfully tuning out the MSM. It’s not easy to do. Back when, believe it or not, they actually did address “pizzagate,” that was their response. They said pizzagate was a “conspiracy theory” relating to government officials meeting in the basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizza to engage in pedophilia. So they went and checked, and found that the place had no basement. Case closed!

        I was thinking about the last sentence too as I asked myself, “why do we accept metaphysical premises, just as we do moral axioms?”(For instance, who says that the creator of Life,must alsobe the creator of everything else?  Plasmas? Protons? Nuclear fusion? Aluminium? Rocks?Why must all physical constants have originated at the same time, can’t they accrete, like notes added to a developing symphony? etc.)The thing is, yes, history was recorded accurately- so it could be revised.The revisionists then accept the revised version as real history, and base their moral assumptions on the new narrative as if it were true.Their benchmarks and goalposts have changed along with it, but if you repeat the original version to them, you’re attacking their motives, their identity as “the good people”.You must, then, be a bad person.

            Jews say.In their scrolls they proclaim themselves the gatekeepers of god.As Norm McDonald might say: What a coincidence!As it is handed down to us, their god is going to get us unless we appease it, and we have to believe their scrolls in order to appease it.In the first creation story,  gen 1:1 into 2:2, the earth surrounded by water is already in existence.

                Thanks, I should’ve said meta axioms, moral premises-For example, “God must be all-powerful or he can’t exist” is a made up axiom like “racism is bad”.An unexamined core assumption, such as the beliefs of the managerial class.It strikes me as the mindset of the sages: their concepts are limited, simple acceptance, like a child understanding the rules of his nursery, but unable to consider a modern industrial civilization outside the front door.Or of your illustration, the scientific view of desert primitives living in tents.  This is the elder race from whom we receive all wisdom?A view informed by modern science is too much to ask.   Perhaps then morality has the simple efficiency of punishment-reward, the best one can do with limited information.Or, is it that their language lacks the useable concepts?The managerial clerics can only think in Newspeak, the neocons, in rote examples of Biblical verse.  They can’t see anything outside of their frame.

            Brand was demonetized on YouTube.
That doesn’t really affect him near to medium-term because he probably has at least high six figures, maybe low seven, of funds and assets tucked away.
I find him grating, but he’s getting a lot of topics you never see in the MSM in front of his 6 or 7 million subscribers.

        I was reading up on the Oded Yinon Plan. If only we could go back to a time where people were honest about acknowledging that the word is made up of factions vying for influence, power, dominance, paths to ascension … …I found the Israel Greatness article by Prager that I mentioned yesterday. It truly is an astounding read. He takes the mask off here. From the dopey Droopy guy with the funny dog in front of the fireplace to a vicious supremacist. I don’t know if the people who organized the surprise attack a few weeks ago intended this as a consequence, but it is out there now. Slowly this kind of stuff along with big money taking money away from the Universities not for being rabidly anti-white but for other reasons. For a brief moment, the tools and foot soldiers of The Regime found themselves, inadvertently, shaking their fist at The Man.Everyone has seen it now. If this was intended, it was a stroke of genius. Yet another genie that can’t be put back into the bottle.https://amgreatness.com/2023/10/24/the-hamas-slaughter-confirmed-everything-i-have-believed/

It had the immediate effect on me of making me wonder if all of his dooming may have been a deliberate corollary to the WEF efforts to put the kibosh on industrial civilization. Maybe not, but I won’t look at his output in the same way going forward.

            It *is* curious how many supposed dissidents have popped up to join the kill-the-arabs chorus. There are two substackers, Jordan Schachtel and Alex Berenson, that I subscribed to during the Coof madness. When it comes to Coof they’re quite solid but both are now devoting every other update to the 6 trillion Jews Hamas killed a few weeks ago in the border raid and how we need TOTAL JIHAD to avenge them. I’d say the Pals did us all a favor by getting so many popular “edgy” types to make a big (and revealing) show of bowing and praying to Tel Aviv 5 times a day. Of course, it’s a downer because you see that even a lot of “our thing” is actually just stage-managed horseshit.

                Heh. “…bowing and praying to Tel Aviv 5 times a day.”
Mohammed originally DID pray in the direction of Tel Aviv (Jerusalem) 5 times a day!
Until…the elders of the Medina rejected his demand that they recognize him as an authentic Old Testament prophet.
Then he told his followers to turn the other way, and bow instead to Mecca.
Now, why would an Arab pagan…demand that the Jevvish elders of the Jevvish quarter accept him as a Jevvish prophet?
(Shortly after that, his gang began murdering people who insulted him.)

            Prager had a point, although not the one he thinks.It does appear that the Jews have been singled out, chosen.But. Then the question arises, chosen for what?Any cursory review of Jewish history would show that they would have been much better off if they were not chosen. How many times has their God chosen them for special treatment? Smited on this cheek then the other. Massacres, famines, droughts, kicked out of Eden, drowned out after 40 days &amp; 40 nights of heavy rain, Sodom &amp; Gomorrah, wandering about for 40 years in search of their Promised Land…and on top of all that and more, mutilation of the penis!“Please God, chose somebody else!”

        “People under investigation by the police have the habit of creating stories to explain their innocence, on the assumption that if it is a good story the cops will accept it.”
Cops love when people do this. It makes their job so much easier. Many, many people have talked their way right into prison when the cops had nothing on them.  Almost nobody invokes their sacred rights to just shut up and make the cops figure it all out without your help.  They just cannot help themselves.  Even people who absolutely should know better. Even lawyers. Even jailbirds.

Never – NEVER – talk to the cops. Be polite if you can, always civil, and ask if you are under arrest.
If not, get up and leave. If so, ask to speak to your/an attorney. Nothing more, and don’t sign anything.

            Yup.
In order, the police officer’s priorities are: muh salary, muh pension, and muh department.
Their number one goal is finding the next perp and getting them into the legal system to extract that perp’s wealth as well as generate all kinds of transactional fees in the process of extracting that perp’s wealth in service of funding their compensation.
This also helps justify increased wealth extraction from the relevant tax herd under the guise of, “public safety.”

                We have de facto laws in the US, especially around money.  There is no black letter law against carrying money in the US, but it is de facto illegal. Cops rob people on the side of the road and in airports.  There was just a big story about how the cops in Atlanta were waiting until the people were just about to board (domestic) flight and then searching people. They said this was “voluntary” despite threatening anyone who said no with dogs and delays.  Any cash they find, they just steal.A couple of years ago, the cops actually robbed an armored car on the side of the road.Worse, they tell the people that getting the money back will just be a matter of routine. Almost nobody gets one red nickel back. Few get 1/2. One in a thousand who get a free lawyer (who are trying to get it overturned) to take up the case will get it all back.The getting 1/2 back, I think, is the most offensive. They deliberately drag the case out to run up your legal bills, which you cannot get compensated.  In some cases, they will call you the day before a hearing and offer to settle the case. You get 1/2 the money back in these offers.It’s just one big grift.

            It depends. If you are under suspicion of, or being questioned in relation to, a “conventional” crime, then yes, by all means, shut up. But if you are in the dock for being a “MAGA white supremacist domestic extremist” then it doesn’t matter what you do or don’t say, you are going down. However, being a “MAGA white nationalist/supremacist extremist” has not (yet) become a crime under the US code, or any state code (I don’t think), so they have to find some other justification, which, once they have gone so far as to find one, they most certainly will make it stick, regardless of what you do or don’t say. If you don’t just end up like that old geezer in Utah a few weeks back.I believe you should be able to surmise, from the outset, whether or not the authorities’ interest in you is politically motivated. If it is, it may well be to your advantage to make a great big noise. And in the case of politically motivated prosecution, it probably can’t hurt, because you are most certainly going down if you don’t make one.Of course it will be more complex than that, so I suggest you consult an attorney, should you find yourself in this unfortunate situation.

                Write me from prison and let me know how its going.At least with regular crime, you’ll be dealing with state level police who will most likely record the conversation both audio and video. There won’t be “confusion” about what you said.The FBI, OTOH, will not ever under any circumstances agree to be recorded. There is a case where the FBI agent was interviewing a cop who had his bodycam on. The FBI agent went ballistic and ordered him to shut it off.  Then, the cop arrested the agent and put him in the back of the cop car and the FBI agent started literally whining. It’s on youtube. It’s as funny as it sounds.It is a felony to record them superstitiously.  The “official record” of what you said and what they said is what they decide to write down.  Even if you manage to keep yourself out of black letter law trouble, you will get convicted of lying to the FBI (they, of course can lie to you).  Martha Stuart can tell you all about it.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujp1Ol9yChE

                        It is a federal felony to record any government agent without their consent.  They will never give it.Thing is, it’s not a strict liability crime (a strict liability crime is one where intent is irrelevant.). If you have a doorbell that always records and you have a conversation with the fbi at your front door, it’s not a crime and it is admissible. But since this has happened a few times, they ask now. If you lie and say “Why, no officer, I don’t have a recording device on this porch,” you’re back to being a felon. If you say yes, they leave, which is good way to get rid of them.I heard of a lawyer that tells his clients to tell the FBI they would be glad to make a statement at their lawyer’s office. When the FBI calls the lawyer to set up the interview, the lawyer mentions that the conference room is wired to always record. FBI hangs up.It really is amazing the lengths they go to in order to avoid a true record of what happened.They will never ask you 3 yes/no questions. It will be 8 hours of questions. At the end, after 8 hours, they hand you a 50 page hand written document and tell you to sign it under oath (under perjury) that you have read and understood every single word and agree that this is a complete and truthful reflection of the interview. It will never be verbatim. It will be their interpretation of what you said. If there was a recording, this could be clarified.  This is evil. This and other similar reasons is why they have a 98% conviction rate.

                        Huh?  Since when is it a felony to record any government agent?
In fact, almost every circuit court has now ruled that one does have the right, subject to time, place, manner restrictions, to record government employees. And that includes FBI agents who come to your door.
As mentioned above, I wouldn’t volunteer any information and would politely dismiss them from my presence, but the fellow in this video handles them with Jedi-like brilliance.

            “Almost nobody invokes their sacred rights to just shut up and make the cops figure it all out without your help.”An ex-LEO I know quite well has a philosophy that seems appropriate here:  ‘Criminals are mostly stupid, it’s the smart ones we don’t catch’.Here in AZ, the law specifically requires that *if* you state:  “I wish to have a lawyer, before answering any questions.”—at *any* time in the process—the police have to stop asking you questions.  Even further, to encourage such “good” behavior on the part of the police, anything you say after that request is not admissible at trial, this making questioning counter productive—at least to obtaining a conviction.  (I’ll ignore police simply lying about such events.  We’ll leave that up to body camera examination.)Even that law was shown to not address all the shenanigans in police investigations, so a further law was passed—you may/must now *assert* that you are the “victim” in a criminal investigation and this triggers your right to be treated as *innocent* if no contrary evidence is immediately discovered.  Prior to that law, the innocent party was often arrested, held and grilled at the station for good measure (actually a technique to produce confession while the innocent party is confused, scared, and under the influence of an adrenaline rush (talkative).Given the above simplicity wrt asserting your “rights”, I’d agree with the “criminals are stupid” comment.  People are in general stupid and when approached by police in a criminal matter scared and therefore even less thoughtful.No comments needed regarding the absurdity of having to pass a *second* set of laws to reassert a Constitutionally stated Right (law).  It is what it is in “clown world”.

                Sure, criminals are likely below average in intelligence. But that really doesn’t explain what’s going on.  Not to mention there are plenty of high IQ people in prison. The problem is, they ask open ended questions. You don’t know what they know and what they don’t know. They won’t stop you no matter how absurd your lies are. In fact, the more absurd your lies are, the happier they are to just let you talk.The rules about asserting your rights are not as cut and dry as you think.  There was a case a couple of years ago where a black (obviously) said “I want a lawyer, dawg” which the courts interpreted as “I want a lawyer-dog” They kept asking questions and he started answering them and guess what, all the answers were admissible. The supreme court ruled that your assertion of your rights must be “clear and unambiguous” and not conditional  and that once you make the “clear and unambiguous” assertion of your rights, you cannot then answer any questions again, no matter how many stupid question they ask.The deck is stacked against you in every imaginable way.  Like the lottery, the only way to win is not to play. They can lie to you about anything and everything. They can tell you there is video of you committing the crime. They can tell you your best buddy is implicating you in the crime in the next room. They’re getting time and a half, they do it every day, you are in a life and quasi-death struggle that at best ends with you walking out the door.  You are in a state similar to fight or flight and they are relaxed and getting paid. All the “rules” are stacked against you. But you have a single trump card.

                    Like I said.  If low IQ and Black with Black impulsivities, you are likely to not be able to “shut up”.  Hell, if you could control your emotions, you’d not be in the police station answering questions in the first place.The deck is stacked against you, but perhaps less by society than Mother Nature.  😉  In any event, stupid people are most likely to incriminate themselves, Black or White.High IQ people, or the “smart ones” are less likely to wind up in such positions.  No one said there were no high IQ people in jail, only that it was less probable for them to fall for such police shenanigans—which by the way has always been so and a lot worse years ago before more recent court rulings.

                        High IQ successful people usually don’t commit crimes or don’t get caught, except really bad ones, like murder.  Most completely underestimate the capabilities of the police.  I know of some bombing cases where the perp was caught by tool marks, battery lot numbers or wire chemistry (the jacket).Don’t get me wrong, I do agree with most of what you are saying.  My point is that intelligence isn’t that great a defense.  People get emotional and do stupid things like killing their spouse or sending bombs.  Look at the unibomber. He got done in by his writing style (his brother recognized his writing style). Extremely intelligent, but it didn’t even occur to him that he had a distinct writing style that anyone familiar with his writing would pick up on. In another case, a guy was convicted on the strength of a leaf in the bed of his pickup truck. They DNA tested it and compared to trees at the crime scene.High IQ people tend to think they are smarter than everyone else too.This puts them at a distinct disadvantage.  While it is generally true that they are, there’s a lot of knowledge involved and not just intelligence.  How many people, regardless of IQ know, for example, that scratching off a serial number does pretty much nothing to obscure the serial number?  There was a highly intelligent man who killed his wife and used a chainsaw in the course of the murder and dismemberment of her body. He ground off the stamped serial number of his chainsaw and threw it in the river.  But there’s a chemical you can put on it that exposes the change in density of the metal under the serial number caused from the initial pressure of stamping it. It’s like the number was never ground off. He had registered it years before for the warranty. They called the chainsaw manufacturer and they said, sure, XYZ serial number of model ABC chainsaw is registered to john Smith at 1313 mockingbird lane in Tampa, Florida who just happened to be the husband..If you’re never a suspect, none of this is a problem. But people rarely kill complete strangers. So it’s kinda hard to avoid being suspected when you’re wife turns up dead somewhere.

        Our overlords have been obsessed with controlling information for decades (e.g., Operation Mockingbird) and that obsession has deepened since Trump’s election. I was impressed with the sheer number of intelligence operatives Twitter employed prior to Musk’s takeover. It was proof positive that our overlords consider controlling the flow of information as critical to their power.

        You probably are too generous here. Yes, the People in Charge have the right to be concerned about falsehoods that threaten their narratives. They also are concerned that their own falsehoods might be endangered. Yes, the NPC’s really do believe the nonsense they are told to believe. They also want to believe the nonsense enough to wave off obvious truth. Same as it ever was, to quote.The only thing that has changed is the relatively new technology threatens the Ruling Class’s monopoly on the narrative. Every bit of the squawking about misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information is a desperate plea to impose censorship and to turn back the clock to the days when even the biggest state-sponsored lie went unchallenged. As you point out, it is telling that alleged reporters are not on the doorsteps of Misfud, not visiting Ms. Maxwell in prison, not looking into where all the Ukraine money goes. This deliberate ignorance and spiking of stories always was the modus operandi, but now these very inconvenient stories still get some public attention and never go away. That’s the biggest threat to the official narrative. Whatever his faults, Putin’s designation of the GAE as the Empire of Lies was spot on. The problem for TPTB is that even Joe Blow knows it now even those he mostly chooses to ignore the blatant lying.To put this into context: the utterly unhinged, obvious and psychotic lie that Trump was colluding with Russia might have worked in the recent past and most would have believed it. Jeffrey Epstein would have been forgotten. People would have believed the Covid vaccinations saved millions of lives. The border would be perceived as secure. With collapsed trust, fueled primarily by transparency made possible with technology, TPTB cannot lie unchallenged now. Even worse for them, they cannot even tell truths helpful to them and be believed.As you mentioned, the Ruling Class is transitioning from manipulation to naked force as a direct consequence of the collapse in all trust. This is not sustainable in the long run. It will be miserable for us and, with a little luck, eventually them.

        “As everyone who has worked in a large company knows, the primary goal of managers is to shift the blame and appropriate the credit.”
I always said the goal of management was to keep their/our job; not get clipped in the latest round of “reorganization.”  Same difference though!
What amazed me was the mediocrity at the C level.  Nardelli is an excellent example; he wrecked Chrysler then moves on to Homo Depot.  It’s a revolving door with these people.

            The reason is the Dutch disease. A weird distinguishing feature of the Dutch was that they never asked anyone what they did for a living and were offended if you asked them. It was assumed that such a question was a way of assessing social status before assessing the individual, which is anti-egalitarian. This is now the norm in the managerial elite. In Washington, the question is, “where are you at now?” That is because a) no one actually does anything and b) you are the sum of your credentials and associations.That guy who moves from one failed position to another, often failing up in the process, is one result. Having accumulated enough credentials and associations to get into the C-suite, he then has the C-suit credential and corresponding associations on his CV, which opens doors to other C-suite opportunities. No one ever asks him what he does or what he did, only where he was and with whom he was associated.

                Really not much different than what I observed in the academy.  Seems top level administrators (not academics) filled positions for 5 years or so, before the rank and file caught wise to their incompetence and they moved along.  Rarely heard of one that “quit” a position without an accompanying announcement of their new positions at another university.  Always the same verbiage regarding the “new” opportunities and challenge of the position taken at this new university.Academic administrators could and did fall back on their tenured status in some department or another, but often after a few years moved on as well, which could be expected as they never were welcome in the department in the first place.If an administrator, say like the President, of a university made it over 5-6 years, he was “golden” and really someone competent.  This was exceedingly rare in my institution.  Indeed, in my time there I never served under one.

                        The academy is no more evil than what we make it.  Unfortunately, parents often are ill informed wrt the “product” they are paying for.  So they, or rather their children, are in essence defrauded.One needs to note that for a few generations after WWII, a college degree was a very unique experience.  Even I, of age to attend in the 70’s, was the first in my family to attend post secondary education—let alone graduate school.My family had no idea of what was involved, just that I had attained some “special” status—“my son, the Doctor” meme.  And, given the numbers of degreed people at that time and the lack of faux studies departments, e.g., Ethnic Studies, etc, one’s post secondary education meant something in the general job market.Now of course, we’d expect there to be many parents (college grad’s themselves) who have insight as to the institution and the purpose of post secondary education.  Enough so they don’t let their children waste their time, effort, and money in fruitless attendance.However, those enlightened parents seem to be swamped with a never ending supply of minority parents who are as ignorant of the fraud being perpetrated as were my parents in their day, but are none the less “proud” of their offspring obtaining a worthless piece of paper called the modern college degree.  🙁

            Nardelli is an excellent example; he wrecked Chrysler then moves on to Homo Depot.
Even though I currently own a Mopar product, I assure you Ivan Chrysler Corporation has shown a long history of wrecking itself no matter who sits in the CEO chair.

                Chrysler problems are American workers (IMO).  No foreign owner has been able to make a nickel on the company.  It’s the hot potato of the industry—and I’ve bought three (Jeep’s).

                    To borrow a phrase from Peter DeLorenzo at Autoextremist.com, ChryCo has from time to time always been a “giant steaming bowl of Not Good”.– Bad Engineering– Cheapening out on parts– Questionable styling (Google “1961 Plymouth” or “Chrysler Airflow” and come back to me)– Surly and/or lazy workers– Outdated plantsThey ride the rollercoaster of rising up to profitability, taking their eye off the ball, and plunging into loss, and as we’ve seen, near bankruptcy or actual bankruptcy.At least they smartened up and will offer the next Gen Charger with an internal combustion engine. 👍But no V8. 👎 And who knows if there will BE a Chrysler nameplate, 100 years after it’s birth.But then there’s GM. For how long though . . . . .

        Ahhhhhh. What a great lecture, Z.This is one of the reasons I love this site. Getting to the heart of any matter is dependent on being ruthlessly objective with yourself as well as others. My super power as an aging stubfart griller and normie-con is my ability to self correct, and change my opinions. It’s one I share with you and most of the bums here in the comments. We can look at anything and instead of forming instant opinions and preconceptions. What seperates us from them is the ability to fact check. I learned to do that from your horrible ‘Xirl Science’ work. A lot of these retards and shysters CAN occasionally pen good work – or at least plausible stuff at first glance. But if you spend a couple minutes researching them and familiarizing yourself with their past ….”achievements” and “work”… you can usually figure out whether they are reliable sources or not. It takes two minutes and yet there are vast majorities of all the demographics that won’t do it.  And of course the next step is to start referencing their peers and adversaries and repeat the process and you can suss out the way of things with remarkable swiftness, and identify the people you SHOULD be listening too. Y’know – I disagree with you and all the dissidents all the time… but you guys ALWAYS have valid ammo for your arguments when we disagree. Thankfully my fellow grillers and geezers are ever so slowly getting wise.The problem nowadays isn’t that the lies are halfway around the world at the speed of light – it’s that the truth is too! And like most truths go down like cod liver oil. I have learned to get past the taste and take medicine no matter how horrible it tastes, and dispense with the sugary flavourings added by the Usual Suspects.Fags like Cerno, Vox Day, Milo and that crowd are dangerous because their medicines taste like chit too and seem like hard medicine too – but the metrics are the same. When you step back, it becomes apparent Cerno knows about as much about neural brain chemistry as he knows about snake oil. His hook is that he can make his brain pills seem plausible. The way to handle those guys is the same as the way you handle Xirl Scientists.The problem today is not that lies propagate at the speed of light, it’s that the truth does too, thanks to the internet. Joe Biden craps his drawers or trips on his shadow and we know about it, backed up with vid and audio – at the same time his spin doctors do. And we are fact checking the story before his spin doctors can even formulate the lies needed for a cover up. We need to become people that know things, rather than folks that believe things. Somehow we were able to do that in the distant past without the internet.Have a great weekend and good luck with the house hunting.

This. The truth also cannot be suppressed as it once was.
As for Cernovich, anyone who would buy anything from that weird-looking, speech-impaired creep actually does need a brain pill that truly works.

        That stupid word “narrative” burst onto the scene 5 years ago and seems to be the only dumb thing anyone talks about. It’s the same as propaganda, lies and bullshit. Ideology if we are being generous. Anybody who peddles in fake storytelling instead of reality is an awful, terrible person. Which is why I work in solitude away form most idiotic managers who still dream of being and playing the exact role of harry potter, luke skywalker or who the hell ever was popular in the those awful marvel movies.

            Narrative is velleity. Those who craft narratives are projecting what they wish was reality or what they hope reality will become. Narrative is not usually totally divorced from reality (there must be some degree of plausibility for it to function effectively), but the relationship to it is usually quite tenuous. Propaganda, lies and bullshit? Substantially, yes. But the narrators have genuine faith in their own bullshit.

In this song, producer Brian Eno and Talking Heads frontman David Byrne are at the apogee of whatever it is they do (Byrne claims he was just riffing on some Southern preacher).
This song is about being unafraid of the passage of time.
Byrne gave his take on this song to NPR:“We’re largely unconscious. You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else. We haven’t really stopped to ask ourselves, ‘How did I get here?’”
