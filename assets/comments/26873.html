        Strike Three:  “Tucker’s program from last night was absolutely outstanding. I am too naive to understand or figure out how he still gets away with it.”
Ronehjr: “Has anything come of Tucker’s broadcasts? If nothing has, that explains how he gets away with it.”
@Ronehjr.  Too cynical.  You may as well have said, “No one can help.  Nothing will ever change. Let’s kill ourselves.”  Tucker is the result of decades-long dissident ideas finally reaching the mainstream.   It’s a slow grinding uphill battle. Results aren’t always apparent.

        I’m not knowledgeable about this stuff. Do MiGs have the range to fly from Ramstein? It looks like round trip would be about like flying across the US.

        Awright, now this is getting a bit too much for me.  So we have tiny-hat, degenerate nudie comedian ‘Ukrainian’ Zelensky channeling Winston Churchill (and whether he deserved his reputation is a totally separate matter) and the media reports this in utter and fawning seriousness.  Please, someone, anyone . . . Can you make it stop?https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10590233/Volodymyr-Zelensky-delivers-historic-address-House-Commons.html

            Yes they did. Flew in transports, met the trucks at a dark spot on the runway, loaded up, and then made their getaway.
Germany wanted some of the gold that they supposedly had held for them in the US. NICHTS, NULL, KEIN GELD. Probably were told, “Trust us, it’s safe and in US hands”. Sounds legit.
Kinda like the gold from Libya’s central bank, and who knows how much gold from other shitty little countries They elected to throw against a wall every few years…just to show They mean business?
Putin had it right; bandits he called the West.

Wow.
BTW, the other comment under yours was one intended to respond to a question about whether the US hijacked the gold from the Ukrainian Central Bank back in 2014-5. My fucking Apple phone wouldn’t let it post, but when I used my old Samsung to postthiscomment, it appeared under your link about The Comedian addressing the House of Commons. Sorry about that.

                Zelensky, assuming he isn’t captured or killed by the Russians, will inevitably move to the US. There will be a book deal and after that he is either a talk show host or a state representative from, well umm… I just don’t know, where could it be?? Oh right, California of course.

        Karen Carpenter is Exhibit A of the law of diminishing returns. Treat every crisis like a political opportunity and soon enough you get peasants and bums storming the Bastille. And the political leadership of the West is stupid, cowardly, nepotistic, and charisma free. So they have nothing to fall back on and cannot foresee predictable outcomes.Russia will cut off Germany’s natural gas, and boom! there goes millions of jobs at Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes etc plus all the Mittelstand employers as the jobs but not workers get moved to China immediately. Thus tens of millions middle class go to poverty level, along with states with dependency on those jobs, just as 100 million Muslims from Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, Iraq etc. join with 100 million Africans to immavade Europe and demand food, shelter, and European women. France and maybe Germany will fall to Muslim/African Islamic Republics with Whites as slaves, other places will have emergency regimes kicking out the non-Whites for survival, many places will invite in Putin as a savior. [This is predictable.]Here in the US, I think Putin will amp up anti-White hatred via social media paid shills (he is not our friend, it is also not our duty to fight him) and get the Cartels to expand Juarez style mass violence all over the US with heavy weapons shipped to them. Of which Putin has many: anti tank hand held stuff, AKs, etc. All against a backdrop of real hunger and deprivation, shelves empty again, what little food there is costs a fortune, Psaki telling people upset about gas prices to eat cake and buy electric cars.US/Western leadership overestimates how much trust/support their leaders have, outside the media bubble, the limits the population will tolerate in declining living standards, and the potential violence under the surface waiting to be unleashed from all sides. Putin and Xi are veteran political operatives who experienced failure and hardship and know it well. Our leadership are senile, supported by fifth rate women and degenerate stupid gays.

        Poland transfers all MiG-29s to US for probable transfer to Ukraine in short order:
https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/poland-announces-all-its-mig-29-jets-will-be-transferred-us-send-ukraine
Oh look, Poland is buying a bunch of overpriced F-16s to replace them, with 10% guaranteed for the big guy.
I wonder how long it will take Rammstein to get the MiGs decked out in Russian camo and livery for a potential false flag operation.

            Safe bet is Poland resisted the U.S. request to allow the jets to be flown from their soil to fight in the Ukraine. The Germans likely are not thrilled to have the craft on their own soil. I’m getting a sense that Europe may be starting to break with the United States, and the Empire is probably afraid Zelensky is about to enter into an agreement with Putin and wants to derail it BAMN.
It may be a prelude to a false flag but it appears to be the Poles saying “no.”

Yes. Apparently the Poles do as well.
Reading through the accounts again, though, this may be more kabuki than reality. Only one prong, the provision of the craft, has been met. Allowance of the Ukrainians to fly out of Ramstein remains dubious.

I hope so.
But given the headlong self immolation of the entire European economy over the support of a money laundering child traffic coup backed state govt I am unfortunately rather pessimistic.

                    @trumpton:To emphasize the degree of mental retardation, check out the brilliant cloak and dagger plan that was shelved:“Under one scenario that has been floated, Poland would deliver the fighter jets to the U.S. base in Germany, where they would be repainted and flown to a non-NATO, non-EU country. Ukrainian pilots would then come to fly them to Ukraine.No country has been publicly identified as a transit point, but Kosovo, a non-aligned country that is very friendly with the United States, has been mentioned as one of several nations that might be willing to serve as a middle point.”Kosovo.We are going to need a bigger bomb shelter.

            Well, thanks to Jack Dobson for his link to the story about the Lying Liars in the ZOG backing down on this madness.
Here is amother link that is pretty scathing anout the whole farago, and justly so:

        Very interesting political line trotted out today by Democrats and some Republicans.  We need to “sacrifice for freedom.”  In any other time, when the country was chock full of social capital, that line would have worked.  Everyone would have “done their part”…..fur freeduum!  But today, with social capital exhausted.  With everyone a stranger in their own neighborhoods.  Everyone living paycheck to paycheck in a de-industrialized country, I just don’t see this gaining traction.  I see anger and recrimination.  This all smacks of desperation.  It’s not a line that the country is ready to hear, nor should it be.  It’s not going to work on anyone.  Not on the Filipina nurse who just wants to wire money home and not on the neck tatted bartender paying child support.  I’m waiting for Biden to start wearing an FDR style cape, Maybe some spats.

            Wish I were as optimistic about people’s mindset, but I fear the propaganda is working.  Heard about a poll earlier (NewsMax I think) that had something like 70% of Americans willing to pay even higher gas prices to “support Ukraine”.  Very disheartening.  Damn those black pills are bitter.

                Never trust a (push) poll. Working-class wages have been flat since the 70s. Folks that live paycheck-to-paycheck and those on fixed incomes are already struggling w/ groceries, let alone filling up the gas tank.

                    All publicly released polls are untrustworthy. Accurate polling is expense and NO ONE does it as a public service.My illusions that there were any shreds left of mathematical or scientific propriety were shattered when I saw a poll for the 2016 election that showed Clinton over Trump in Georgia by 14+ points. Once you get, inside your head, that they lie about one thing then it follows that they will lie about anything and everything. Why would they not? When they cheat less, it is simply to conserve credibility to sell lies on more important issues.Most people don’t want to believe that the entire media system, undergird by ostensibly scientific polling, has the primary objective of keeping them misinformed and politically and socially atomized. It is natural to WANT to trust, because we want predictability.However, we have to get used to the reality that we cannot show default trust anything we don’t observe for ourselves, keeping in mind that our observations are subject to sample bias and thus we have to be careful about generalizing them.

        Off topic and not intended to derail an excellent thread about issues of utmost importance:  Yesterday, I think, someone else here posted a link to an article about clueless normatards claiming people are becoming uncivil and complaining about political polarization.  Here’s another one, even better.  It’s about putative conservatives and some genuine nationalists moving to Idaho.““It doesn’t bode well for our sense of community here,” said Rognstad, who is mounting a campaign for governor. “It’s a challenge to civility.”Barbara Russell, who lives in nearby Bonners Ferry, Idaho, expressed similar concerns.Bonners Ferry feels like it’s been overrun with white nationalists, said Russell, who owns a dance studio in the town of 2,600 residents.“What they are doing is preparing for war,” Russell said of new arrivals, who often carry guns when in town.“New people are moving in and they go to City Council meetings and tell people who grew up here to go back to California,” Russell said. “They are selling fear is what they are doing.”Link:https://apnews.com/article/business-lifestyle-idaho-sandpoint-ade4fb13d865eb9f9b4dce6c4d944309

            These people voted for Biden, still like him, and think he’s doing a swell job.  It would be hilarious to watch if it weren’t so horrifying, since they are taking us all over the cliff with them as they sleepwalk to their doom.  I’m reminded of the Don McLean line from the song American Pie: “And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage; no angel born in hell could break that Satan’s spell”.  Describes what it feels like to watch our “leaders” speak while a legion of dumbed-down Normies get used to the yoke.

                “Leaders” is old nuspeak that needs to be retired.  We’re not being “lead” anywhere and there’s certainly no “leadership” involved.  We’re SUBJECTS being RULED by RULERS in a REGIME.The left always knows the power of words and that they frequently carry premises that lead inevitably to pre-approved conclusions (“homophobia” anyone?).It’s time for dissidents to stop thinking in these terms and to lead grillers on this.  Here are a few obvious poisoned terms and their straightforward politically important alternatives.“Leaders” -&gt; “Rulers”“Administration” -&gt; “Regime”“Elected” -&gt; “Installed”“Trans” -&gt; “Crossdressers” or “female impersonators”“Public school” -&gt; “Government School”“Intelligence Agencies” -&gt; “Secret Police”“Straight” -&gt; “Sexually Normal”“LGBT” -&gt; “Perverts”“POC” -&gt; “Non whites”Etc.Taking back the language we use is absolutely essential.

Plenty of rainbow flags in the artsy fartsy downtown.  At one time it was a working man’s town.  I doubt there were any news articles interviewing anyone opposed or concerned when filthy degenerates with money were moving there  demanding every knee bow &amp; taking over local positions.  The inland northwest is and will be a haven for those of us who want sanity and safety for our families.It is a war, it was started and declared by them. Given an inch they demand a mile, no matter how much they gain it will never be enough and will never stop. They hold power for now. But only for now.

        So far the Ukraine stuff is mirroring the early Coof propaganda pretty much exactly. There’s the total lack of curiosity for one. A real journalist, for example, always asks and then tries to answer for his audience, the “5 questions” – who, what, where, why, and when. Of course we all know the last real journalist was tossed in the woodchipper years ago.So here we go again – where did the Coof come from? Somebody had sex with a pangolin, or a bat, or who cares, the important thing is that we’ve all got to be locked in our houses until the CDC tells us it’s safe. Why did Putin invade Ukraine and not say, Aruba? Because he threw a dart at a map on Christmas morning like he does every year, or maybe he’s high on drugs, or who cares, the important thing is that Putin is Saddam (pronounce it “Sodom” like Bush Sr. did for extra points), Ukraine is Iraq, or Kuwait, or Iran and it’s 1990 again.I’m sure this is the plan anyway. The ruling class is presenting people with a chance to skate away from the fact that they never questioned the Coof narrative and are still wearing those silly masks. In one smooth motion that would make a stage magician proud they’ll replace their “I’m vaccinated” pin with a Ukrainian flag pin. Some will combine the two into one towering, synergistic pile of virtue signalling horseshit and wear a Ukrainian flag mask. I’m almost cynical enough at this point to contract with a textile company in China to print the damn things. What’s the going rate? like 10 shitty masks for a dollar? Then sell them for $3.50 each. It would be free money especially around where I live.

                For our rulers, it is and will always be 1938, beating back the Hitlers forever, to preserve our sacred democracy. For the grillers, who “know their history” because they listen to Sean Hannity and read all of Bill O’Reilly’s latest books, the everlasting struggle is against new Neville Chamberlains.
Fuck this. Bring me 1939 and let’s get on with it.

        Give the way the Senate is structured there’s a possibility that republicans could have 60 Senate seats in 2025 along with a president desantis. Being in that big of a hole would be hard to dig out.
Could anyone see the democrats using corporations as well as blue states to create a situation where they could regain the Senate? By that I mean have all the dem aligned corporations intentionally scale back production and have states like NY or CA intentionally crash there economies so that it could affect the whole economy and cause tds approval to tank.

                        DeSantis barely won his last election.  He was a nobody.  Now he strides the political world like a colossus. Really?Look, I don’t know the guy and I *like* his position on the coof.  But I’m old enough to have seen this song and dance multiple times.A Pol does something that catches the attention of the benighted masses–most often by accident–and he personifies the second coming.  He rides that into office and 6 months later–zip.  Didn’t we just see that?I for one won’t be fooled again.

        MSNBC Race Baiter: Americans Only Care About Ukraine Because They’re White…
https://www.weaselzippers.us/479995-msnbc-race-baiter-americans-only-care-about-ukraine-because-theyre-white/
This schvartzer woman on MSNBC is correct, not that there’s anything wrong with it. Of course people are going to care more about people like themselves than those unlike themselves. Conversely, I doubt that many Oppressed People of Color (TM) give a rat’s patootie about a conflict between two closely related tribes of crackers in Eastern Europe.

            The evidence that Americans actually care about Ukraine is thin, as Americans were overwhelmingly opposed to intervening in this conflict. Yea, there are discouraging signs now that the propaganda is starting to work, but the base impulse of Americans is to stay out of these foreign disputes and let them resolve themselves. Not that the ruling class cares.It is worth noting that the media plays this trick often. They will give wall-to-wall coverage to a particular story and then excoriate the audience for their programming decisions. They did it with that poor murdered girl Gabby Petito, after weeks of nonstop coverage on CNN and MSNBC, CNN and MSNBC declared that covering her proved Americans are racist and evil, because their stories were about this “dead white girl” as opposed to the “dead black girls” that were ignored. As if Americans are collectively responsible for what CNN and MSNBC choose to fill their airwaves with.

                Lusitania and Pearl Harbor were false real flags.  The regime engineers a real attack by making it necessary for the “bad guys” then waves the bloody shirt afterward.  This cannot be “discovered” because the attack is real and anyway who believes whatever nonsense the bad guys say about it.  Even knowing their side makes you a traitor.
They’re already effectively doing this supplying weapons to the US proxies in Ukraine, but some seem concerned that Putin won’t take that bait and are looking to force a counterattack with even more outrageous provocations

        “Progressive Inc. is now willing to tolerate ten dollar gasoline and bread lines just so they can show their solidarity with Ukraine.”It pains me to have to disagree, ZMan, but people are eager for $10 gasoline b/c they are taking Mr Hamilton off the ten-spot and replacing him with Sojourner Truth.Or is it Harriet Tubman?Well, anyway, with the icon of a Sacred Negress.THAT is the purpose of ten-dollar anything.Bold forecast:Soon, *everything* will cost $10. Or even multiples of 10 bucks (which will henceforth be called “Sojourners,” which some irreverent boys will shorten to “jous”).And *all* payments for *anything* will be in ten-spots, under penalty of name-calling and cancellation.A word to the wise …

        What’s the opinion that you’re getting from people on the ground? Is the media hysteria working on the Dirt People? It’s hard for me to gauge it since I spend more time in the Hive.The midwit Hive people are all lapping up the propaganda. At the same time, they are much less fanatical about this than they were about COVID. They had their 10 minutes when they added a Ukrainian flag to their Facebook profile but interest seems to have waned quickly.Anger seems to no longer be a response of the average white person. I get angry when I see the gas and food prices. Most Hive people wearily accept it, plus at least they aren’t racist like Putin and the media says they are Good People. The media carefully controls what the Hive people think. They just babble about electric cars (sorry, in reality only the rich can afford that) and green energy. Plus it’s all Putin’s fault. The thought never crosses their mind that it could be our own leaders’ fault.POCs in the Hive are signalling their allegiance to Ukraine, but the vast majority don’t care at all. They didn’t come to Canada to “be Canadian”, but they also didn’t come here to eat bugs and display their undying loyalty to insane elites for whatever the cause du jour is. Many, especially Muslims, have bad memories of Globohomo bombing their countries at some point and support Russia.Basically – white upper middle class &amp; midwit wannabe Hive people are more susceptible to being brainwashed by the Russia propaganda but at a much less intense level. POCs are probably less brainwashed by the Russia propaganda than the COVID propaganda. Not sure what the Dirt People are saying – I’m hoping that people would revolt if they try and draft an army.

            The Grillers and Boomercons have become somewhat more pro-Ukraine but there is still much more disinterest than in any other conflict in my lifetime. The Hive people are moving on to the next Big Thing although they are still bleating about their purity on this issue.
I am more looking forward to how everyone responds to the economic fallout, which will be lit AF. We are looking at a literal cratering of markets and wealth.

                I am seeing almost total disinterest except for a few people who live for social media validation.  Other than people who the “I support the current thing” meme genuinely applies to, no one seems very interested in Ukraine.  The clip of the MMA guy, who was asked in his press conference about it and said essentially, “I don’t want war, but I am not fighting until they try to invade Arkansas” has seen some popularity.Declan Leary, had a funny, but kind of long write up on the “Principles First” conference at TAC.  The average person ignores these people now.  They don’t get any traction with normies.https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/dispatch-from-the-anti-cpac/

                    They may not be interested, but every politician is rushing to the camera to signal their virtue by proclaiming their own population must be willing to starve for their virtue and its a price they have to pay.
I loathed “stay safe”, and already if I hear “the price of freedom” one more time I’m likely to wring some fuckers neck.

                You will be fineThere are still some rational people left in Europe, and Europe and Putin will be resolving this — not America.   I wouldn’t be surprised if Macron pulls it off and becomes the great peacemaker.   I have always been, if secrets must be told, a bit of a Francophile, and if France can get back to being France then the world is a much better place, but it needs to be taken seriously, and the perv Macron could be the one — asinine as it sounds, but stranger things have happened.If America keeps pushing and pushing, you are going to see a massive anti-American movement take over Europe.  People are at wit’s end with Uncle Sam.  And Europe will gradually be taken into the Russia-China orbit.   Italy already is and to a large extent is a client state of China and its belt and road.  I bet China bails them out too if they default on their bonds.America will become more and more entangled with countries in our part of the globe, if I had to guess.  And gets back to bullying little Amerindians and the Italian, Iberian and German diaspora in South America.What to watch out for is Israel.  If Israel starts siding with Putin and Europe, you know it’s over for the USA as far as being a power on that side of the globe.My 2 cents FWIW

            I agree with your points, and I would expand on one to contrast with ZMan. His conclusion is that this causes the NWO to grind to a halt. I believe it is the exact opposite. This is doing exactly what they want- Universal basic income will be coming to offset skyrocketing inflation (look how perfect Covid was as a dry run – both psychologically and infrastructure wise). Creates the perfect straw man (Vlad) to blame – someone probably outside the NWO (Oceania and Eurasia). The natives will become restless – all the better to cow the dissenters.I dislike being a downer, and I enjoy Z’s post, and I imagine to be so involved requires an optimism to drive you rather than write brief disagreements in the comments section. However – we just had our government ban oil important from essentially our largest foreign supplier at a time when prices are skyrocketing from A-Z. I mean – seriously – this has to be by design as it fits into their goals. Houses- unaffordable. Move into mega cities. Oil- unaffordable. Go green (and public transport in our hive megacities). Food- unaffordable. Require food stamps, but you only get them if you get your weekly covid vaxx and comply with all other directives.

        Like Ann Coulter said in 2015 of Trump running on immigration, “There was a $100 dollar bill lying on the sidewalk and he picked it up”.(Of course he didn’t do much about immigration once he won.)The Republicans could pick up the $2000 gold coin off the sidewalk this time, by running against sanctions/war. Instead, they’re off to Sea Island to scheme against AF candidates and twist the arms of any Trump-adjacent attendees.They won’t pick up the gold this time – but Republicans will win anyway due to the misery Biden’s sanctions-madness is going to impose on the country. Biden might even succeed in forcing Russia to request payment for oil, wheat, etc in yuan. Maybe even gold. What then Biden?Thing is, half of the country is certifiably mad, breathing their own fumes. But as Marx said, “you can chase reality out the door, but it comes back in through the windows”. Vlad cracked a couple of windows. We all have to just pray our so-called  “leaders” can sit still for a couple months without reaching for the suitcase buttons. Sending “backfill” armaments and “enemy combatants” does up the ante.

            Biden announced he is going to cut off all Russian oil imports. That should send oil well past $200/barrel. I don’t think the political class will survive the inflation tsunami headed our way. They can re-arrange the lounge chairs any way they like. Nobody will be left to pour drinks.

                When dealing with complex systems like the economy it is never that simple. They can’t just cut off oil, prices shoot up, leadership is replaced, and then everything returns to normal. This is the end of the debt cycle, and we are going to experience some sort of default, but I did think we had a bit longer.

        As furious as the Dirt People may get and as corrupt and incompetent as the Cloud People may be, I don’t yet see how the old bums might be tossed out so that the new bums might be shoehorned in even if elections can’t be rigged which I assume they can be. It would likely take the military going over to the side of the Dirt People.The current view from the gallery is that Russia/Asia is looking to de-dollarize and, at last, to get rid of the petrodollar, the IMF and the World Bank the better to foil the reset agenda of “the Davos crowd” as Tom Luongo calls them. Russia’s current play is to heavily discout oil futures in return for payments in gold, tossing the ruble, for the time being, on the slag pile. Maybe that’s why the loan of jets to Poland to strafe Russian assets in Ukraine.What a way to dial for dollars.

                Yes they did. Flew in transports, met the trucks at a dark spot on the runway, loaded up, and then made their getaway.
Germany wanted some of the gold that they supposedly had held for them in the US. NICHTS, NULL, KEIN GELD. Probably were told, “Trust us, it’s safe and in US hands”. Sounds legit.
Kinda like the gold from Libya’s central bank, and who knows how much gold from other shitty little countries They elected to throw against a wall every few years…just to show They mean business?
Putin had it right; bandits he called the West.

        The Cloud People think in ways that would be alien to the Dirt People. The early robber baron Jay Gould supposedly said,  “I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.” This line was paraphrased in the movie Gangs of New York. Now, think about that. Do you believe that today’s Masters of the Universe are any different? If they decide to “go nuclear” on the Dirt People, they will use this strategy. As America gets bogged down in war and supply chain issues, the cost of living will become so high as to be outside of the masses ability to pay. The cost will also go up for the Cloud People, but their wealth is so much greater they won’t really notice it. Plus, they can finance their own supply chains to make sure they get Russian caviar and Italian leather shoes. There will be men and women that will decide that it is more important that they and their family eat than to give a shit about their fellow man. We will soon see if empty bellies will finally make the normies wake up to their predicament. They’ve been warned for years, but when the warning eventually comes true, what side will they choose? However, the Cloud People will eventually reap what they sow. The Dirt People they hire to protect them from the other Dirt People will eventually become their own Praetorian Guards. And we know what the Praetorian Guards did to the Emperors.

            The thing about Gould is that no matter what he may have boasted he never actually did that. Instead, he spent his energy building things and made life better for millions of people.
We can only wish that our current oligarchs were “robber barons” like Gould and Rockefeller.

        I’m sort of torn.  On the one hand I want Russia to pull the plug on this sad clown show by wiping it out in a cleansing nuclear inferno.  On the other hand I don’t want to spend 10 years without electricity when I can’t even go 10 hours without it.  Any politician who even mentions a “no fly zone” as a solution needs to be hanged.  A great way to sort the dumbest of the dumb is knowing their opinion on that issue.

            JR Wirth:   I share your dilemma.  While I’d love to see Twitter, TikTok, OnlyFans, and Faceborg vanish forever, I depend on the internet for many things and I really like air conditioning.  I am more than prepared emotionally, however, to accept a certain reduction in living standards and a certain increase in economic hardship if Russia were to truly accomplish dethroning the dollar as the reserve currency and killing that portion of the GAE.  Anything that hurts Globohomo is good for me and mine in the long run, however painful it may be short term.

                Same, but I just noticed China is getting into the Russian energy and commodities market, so this may be a win-win for Globohomo if they are still attached to the PRC teat. There does seem to have been a divorce as of late, so they may not share the benefits.

            JR Wirth:  For a good overview of normiecon thinking, scan the headlines (for your own sanity don’t go beyond that) at Gayway Pundit.  The usual foul mixture of neoconism, Trump worship, magic constitutionalism, and race blindness.  Half the daily posts are still about overturning the 2020 erection.  You will also occasionally find a headline of interest but better to then seek out other sources for further information.

                Yeah, the GP has veered sharply into the “Them There Evul Rooskies Need a Good Ass-Whuppin&#x27;” school of “thought”. Larry Johnson was holding out over there for sanity, but I suspect his days are numbered as a poster given the tsunami of bull shit over there. Larry has enjoyed guest poster status at turcopolier.com, Col. Lang’s blog, but similar conditions appear to be being attained there, too.I just found out this morning via a post at Andrei Martyanov’s blog, that Larry has re-opened a blog by himself, hearing footsteps as he likely is, under sonar21.com (A Son of the New American Revolution).For a fully Russian perspective, Martyanov’s blog, smoothiex12.com is worth a visit.Similarly with the blog of Patrick Armstrong, Russian Observer, a Canadian analyst who has been posting at turcopolier, patrickarmstrong.ca for some very good insights.BTW, thanks for the link to Kayfabe In Kiev, that you threw up the other day. I am keeping a window reserved for this, revisiting it for fuller comprehension.

        For all the insanity of our people here in America, the Europeans have truly baffled me. The whole continent has gone all in on hating Russia and DEMANDING the US natural gas tit.
This all could have been solved by kicking the US and NATO out, giving Ukraine to Russia to economically prop up forever more, recreating the Little Entente from the Baltic to the Adriatic and letting France quarterback it.
Instead they are shoving actual weapons od war into a kleptocracy. An anti tank weapon is going to be used rob a bank within this decade.

        The mantra of the cool kids, “it’s all fake and gay,” is sounding more and more like the wisdom of Aristotle or Solomon.We like to poke fun at Joe Griller, but in some sense, isn’t that an expression, albeit weak, of that strain of American isolationism which was heretofore more vigorous and pervasive?I don’t care how much the norms, either side of the political lake, or even the true mentals clamor for sanctions, boots on the ground, or contrails in the sky, the fact of $10 gas and barren grocery shelves will carpe the diem.  As Montesquieu– or was it Lady Gaga–once opined, its the economy stoopid.  It will be interesting to see just how low the great pretender’s numbers can go in the face of his latest follies, and just how long the masses stay the course before spitting the bit

            “It’s the economy stupid!” Was a campaign slogan as early as 1972 and Nixon’s second run.  It served to push the Vietnam war into second place of voter concerns.  That was my first election voting. (Nixon won and drove the war into hyperdrive.)
Of course, the economy *was* heating up due to Vietnam and everyone was making money, but the piper needed to be paid during the Carter administration.  That killed Carter (as well as the embassy hostage situation and artificial oil shortages) and led to Reagan’s presidency.

            3 Pipe Problem:  It is and isn’t the economy, stupid or not.  Most people are too stupid to notice the genuine root of their problems until the economic impact affects them.  But economic insanity is a symptom and the resultant obscene gas prices and wheat futures and broken supply chains are merely further indicators of our real problems.  We are ruled by a hostile global elite and global bankers/kleptocrats who hate us and want us dead.Human motivation is neither rational nor purely economic.  That’s Sailer’s drum; let him beat it.  There is a lot more underlying Putin’s and the banksters’ actions than anything economic, and to ignore nationalist concerns, security issues, and cultural differences is to qualify the quantitative.

                You can—and the masses do—vote over economic concerns without having any knowledge of cause and effect.  Happens with low level voters all the time.  They could care less what the news reports and pundits say, they just know their bills are due and they’ve no way to pay them.How can they possibly effect change?  Vote for the other guy.  It’s not rocket science, and it’s not really effective in the long term as “the other guy” is a grifter as well.Your argument is more an explanation of why democracies (as ours is now structured) can’t be sustained, but I’m not sure it rebuts the truism under discussion—that people do vote their pocketbooks.

                    Compsci:  Valid point.  Perhaps I’m just reacting to so much of what I’ve read making purely economic arguments against any war.  War over Ukraine is insane, but I don’t think either side is thinking of the cost (in blood or money).  On the other hand, the underlying financial cause (small hat oligarchs looting Ukraine under cover of global bankers/oligarchs and American neocons) includes an enormous dose of ethnic self interest that is too often lost or ignored by the ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ truism.  I guess that’s my gripe.

                        In that you’re correct.  Emotion plays a big part in the grift.  Look, I’ve recounted here recently how I (and others) were lured into the supporting the first Gulf War. But once that war started, we were in for 20 years, trillions of $$$ on the credit card and nothing to show for it.

^^^THIS^^^
But the ultimate looting goal is Russia. Putin stopped (((them))) from looting Russia 30 yrs ago, and they have hated him ever since.
And here’s the thing: Either (((they))) and their fellow travelers manage to gain permanent control of Russia’s astounding natural resources, or the Cloud People are finished.
We are watching the beginning of the Third World War.

        Nuts &amp; bolts.Collapse will come on quickly and cities will erupt in violence &amp; mayhem. LEOs will be overwhelmed and NGs will be activated in order to quell riots, but the latter will siphon off most of the few remaining productive men out of the economy and hasten the decline. The ensuing fog of chaos is the cloak that enables effective action.Take heed of the lessons of Ukraine. Their common folk are dying in a futile battle against armor &amp; artillery when it all could have been avoided had they expurgated their disease cells years ago when the infestation began. Like any cancer, early detection &amp; remedy is a must. Waiting is a death sentence.What is much more powerful than being handed a AK-47 and a few magazines of ammo by a government in hiding from the oncoming tanks? Who moves easily through the fog and can get in close? Firemen, EMTs, deliverymen, repairmen, messengers, refugees on the move; think outside the box, be nondescript, innocuous, and ignored. Practice looking panicked, disheveled, and lost. And everything solely within the confines of your cranium. Add in some opportunistic spontaneity and now you’re cooking with gas. Get in, get out, and leave them wondering what happened.

        “What this reveals is that the people inside the political bubble never learned anything from the last decade.” The feedback loop has been broken! So they don’t have to learn anything: election results mean nothing and the Fed printing press covers up the rest.Meanwhile, the Jen Psaki quip about “buying an electric car” shows an important transition in their mindset from power-hungry, which we knew, to downright punitive, which we feared. I would expect to see a lot more of this. Covid was a preview, but it’s going to be an ongoing policy now.As I said here a few weeks ago, American foreign policy has been privatized for profit. The Dirt People own no shares in it. Any white guy joining the armed forces now is an unwitting mercenary for these people. The DR main focus now should be red-pilling the young men to deprive the Beast of foot soldiers.

                    That’s what I did when I was young and didn’t have any good prospects. A four year enlistment got me out of that rut. Found out that our war on terror was BS too, starting me down the rabbit hole that eventually led me here.
I would not recommend that now though. But we need to find a way of engaging with the young men and teach them needed skills. That’s the big problem with the NEET lifestyle, it doesn’t teach useful skills.

            Last night Tucker showed a clip of a young white martial arts fighter in his post fight interview where laid it all out how he isn’t going to fight in Russia, doesn’t know what to make of it and who to believe, but if anyone ever comes to his home in Arkansas he will defend his home and family to the death.
Those sentiments right there are dangerous to the elites.  But they need to be what every young white man of fighting age is thinking.

I couldn’t believe that clip was able to be shown. I was expecting the feed to be cut. Good for him. Frankly, I’m surprised something “unfortunate” hasn’t happened to Tucker. He looks like he is actually enjoying mocking the Cloud People.

                Falcone.  How odd, that is exactly the essence of my discussion to son last Sunday.  He’s a millennial with *sympathies* to Ukraine.  He’s too busy and too young to get his information from any source other than the MSM 15 second sound bits.  He of course thinks we need to fight Putin/Hitler over there before he comes over here.  He’s young, he’ll learn.As we were talking, I pointed to the mountains that surround the house on two sides and then pointed to the immediate neighborhood down below.  I said “…when the ‘hoard’ comes over the pass, I’ll be down in the neighborhood helping those folks I know and live with organize a resistance…but until then it’s not my problem…”

                Just when you think it’s all soyboys and bugmen among the young people, you see this Arkansas fighter and it gives you hope.
The kid is a prime example of who the Cloud People hate.   White….check.  Southerner (might have a confederate flag)….check.  Seems like he might be rural, since he mentioned “Arkansas dirt”…..check.   Macho fighter…..check.   Not concerned with “fighting ’em over there”….check.
I’m also guessing this kid didn’t obediently go get his jab.

        Excellent piece. I’ve mentioned him before, but the most amusing — and disgusting — of the “conservative media” cheering on this insane, stupid conflict with Russia is space lawyer Glenn Reynolds. He got his start as a “war blogger” cheering on the Iraq conflict, so maybe he is merely seeking a return to his salad days. Nevertheless, the glee with which he repeats moronic leftist tropes and non-analysis (“the Russians are bogged down with their forty mile convoy! The Russians did not secure air superiority! The Russians did not do shock and awe! The Russian military is incompetent!”) certainly reveals the absolute intellectual and moral abyss of post-Reaganite boomer conservatism (as well as why Reynolds teaches “space law” rather than practicing). It’s certainly a great winnowing of who can be trusted and who can’t be.Dark days, of course, but I remain optimistic that we are hearing the end of the Lincolnite leviathan watered by the blood of the South, and not the beginning of a new and darker tyranny.Thanks for all you do, Z, and ditto to the commentators here.

            Enoch Cade:  Z has long been one of the few outposts of sanity; he is increasingly the sole outpost.  We have ‘the great divide’ between biological, racial, and cultural reality and the woke world; the divide between Branch Covidians and Purebloods; and now the divide between jingoistic blindness and international realpolitik.  If people felt wuflu showed them who they could trust and rely on, Ukraine fever has further winnowed that number down.
The winnowing is necessary; unfortunately, so is the bloody and painful culling that will most likely follow, whoever may survive it.

                Good point about the winnowing. While a Venn Diagram of Covidianism and Russia Evil! would nearly overlap, the opposite happens the further up the age scale, i.e., there is quite a bit of overlap among Boomer/Normiecon anti-Covidians and Boomer/Normiecon anti-Russia.
We have learned much about how many untrustworthy people are in our midst over the last few years, and you are correct that is valuable knowledge to have given what is about to happen.

        In fact, the default American position until the 20th century was to not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.The nineteenth-century US was occupied with the “54-40 or Fight” argument over the boundary of western Canada from 1846 until 1872. After the War Between the States the the occupation of the South and completing the invasion and occupation of the western part of the continent was of primary importance. The gay nineties opened a new chapter with the global Spanish-American War and the conquest and annexation of the Republic of Hawaii.American hegemony is memorialized in the very words of the Marine Corps hymn, “From the Halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, We fight our country’s battles, in the air, on land and sea.”

The same people who questioned the media narrative on Covid and the nonsensical stories put out on Trump regarding Russian sidewalk sex therapists, are all to eager to believe that Putin is the next 20th century German guy.
The ease at which they are ready to make this a global free for all with nukes is scary.

            Re the ‘lectric:Overpriced E-cars won’t be owned, but subscribed to.The push for electric?B. Gates is developing fast breeder reactors in Wyoming.  After power shortages create demand, voila’, a new industrial boom in nuclear power stocks.The unmentioned agenda is that these fast breeders create not merely weapons-grade, but what has been described as “super weapons-grade” plutonium.Now, the TED talks visionaries can’t seem to clean up the trash (thermal depolymerization, aka garbage gas),or bundle some 30 viable smaller scale energy alternatives into non-grid solutions,or rework minor technical innovations to existing tech,or use far less toxic alternatives,or even resurrect safe 1960s tech (thorium reactor operating at Oak Ridge in 1961)–but they sure as fudge can restart the nuclear arms race.It’s unfortunate that messianic language tries to telescope decades (or centuries, or millenia, or evolutionary epochs)  into a single snapshot– but the spirit of this age is giving me the goddam willies.

                Heh. It’s a funny thing, Alzaebo, when people mention ‘new’ tech. Then you do some digging and find out that the theory was worked out in the forties and the basics perfected by the sixties.
Nothing new under the sun in many ways. In my field of computing, I’m constantly being told of new ‘innovation’ – but it’s just one big hype. Just like true AI.

                        Much yes.  It was possible back in the day to take more Math courses in a CS major than CS courses once upon a time.  Math knocks a lot of majors out of the field.  Same was said of astronomy majors who took the major thinking they were going to be looking at the stars.  😉

I’ve already seen headlines of car makers trying to turn existing features into subscription features… even including the heated seats! (That was BMW in July 2020.)

        The government and media has been on a daily crusade to break every American mentally, physically, and financially the past two years (well, in reality, much longer, but it has been explicit for two years). Is it not curious that, as soon as it looked like that particular crusade was running out of steam, they turn to the endless war crusade? Why should I believe the same government and media that spent 2 years lying to me about a cold virus, especially when their justifications are obvious nonsense about old grannies and fighter pilots? Nobody has explained this to me, especially not the conservacucks who only hopped off the COVID agenda when it became electorally convenient to do so. As always, do not vote for these people. Ever. These monsters do not represent us or have our best interests in mind.

                I’m sure this posting is going heavy on the sarcasm, so I’ll be brief; the above listed parasites will give Biden most of everything he wants, all in the name of that oh-so nauseating word “bipartisanship”. McCornhole &amp; Co will do their best to poison the waters and give the base the finger in anticipation of Trump’s return – at least as the nominee – in ’24.They’re so scared of Trump that I saw an ad last night – that was obviously heavily edited – of sound bites of him “praising Putin” and asking if America really wants to go through this again. The editing was so shitty, even my 12 year old picked up on it.I wasn’t happy with a lot of things he did because I thought he spent too much time chasing everyone who barked at him instead of burying certain people. I’d love to see him back at this point, if for nothing else than to take a wrecking ball to EVERYTHING! Hell, since we’re about to go over the cliff anyway, we might as well have a bit of fun on the way down.

                We’ll see how long the public wants to show support when it costs them—gas prices, food shortages, unemployment—in short, recession.  We’ve seen this before during the Vietnam war.  It got wound up pretty fast when a “war tax” was proposed.  Until then folks believed that “guns and butter” were possible.

                    Our economy is already in shambles and it is already a disaster for the average person. Inflation, gas prices, supply chain shortages, it is all bad, and nobody has really paid any price for it, least of all the people who ran the COVID “response” or monetary policy the past two years.So really how much worse can it get for the average person? If gas prices double again, does it even matter?  if food prices go up another 20% on top of the 20% it already has, will the people in charge pay any price for it? The government can get big tech to just ban anyone who complains, and CNN can gin up an antifa riot at their house. They can make up charges on anyone who tries to protest endless war, with the full bipartisan of the Establishment. They only need to do it a few times before every griller and normiecon gets the message. This is not even theoretical – this is how they have behaved over the past two years and have felt zero shame over it. There is no reason to believe they would not do it again.

                        I’m not sure it’s as bad as it can get.  It takes a few months for the effect to spread and sink in.  Households have yet to make the adjustment to pricing by pulling in their spending.  Still a lot of CC growth if I read correctly. Consumer confidence can still sink lower. But when it gets there, there will be a snowball effect, an avalanche of consumer economic pullback.  Then comes the long hard slug getting people back into the market.A quick ending to the Putin/Hitler debacle, followed by a Rep take over of Congress might keep the worse at bay.

        My recollection of the 1990s is the Balkans were not a big focus of your average normie conservative. It was considered some Clinton thing. There even was a sizable anti-war group of Republicans in Congress that opposed the Kosovo war in 1999. According to one book on the era, Rush and others were “isolationist” on the Kosovo war:https://tinyurl.com/nhd98z3m
All that changed, of course, two years later after 9/11.

            The Neocons of course were for the Kosovo war. Bill Kristol ordered Clinton to “crush Serb skulls.” But the war coincided with the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton’s impeachment, so normie conservatives were inclined to believe Clinton was using the war to distract from his troubles.

                That Kristol is one of the most epic weasels to ever have oozed forth from a cervix. A close friend at the weekend mentioned that we “need to go to war!”, “We must fight!”… with whose sons? With whose sons will we fight?Some Normals also seem to be saying the same. “Fight!”. What can we expect in an age where our leaders ‘lead’ from behind a desk, thousands of miles away. Cretinous.I understand that war has changed, but the way some people just brazenly say this, and then repeat it fervently chills the bone.With who’s sons? Not mine, brother. Perhaps Kristol’s?

                    Orange Frog:  Surprisingly enough, Kristol’s son served in the marines rather than the IDF.  But now he’s busy as legislative director for conservatard Tom Cotton.
It really is nauseating how quickly both GoodWhites and Normatards scream “Fight” when it’s killing other Whites, but serenely sit back and merely type while their nations are invaded by hostile and alien blacks, browns, and yellows.

                    The war is being sold to Americans as a good-guy v. bad-guy battle they can get vicarious pleasure from.  Note the placement of Zelensky as the ersatz hero.  Americans apparently still want to believe themselves to be fighting the good fight against tyranny overseas.  Note too the constant reference to Putin as a ‘bully’.  For the Cloud people it’s little guy vs. the big meanie. For normie it is the circus half of bread-and-circuses, where everyone can give their thumbs up to the most illustrious gladiator.  The sick commercial quality to the war broadcasts from all channels is tough to watch.

                        ” Zelensky as the ersatz hero” I think a The Saker commenter posted a link where you can see the younger Zelensky-seemingly orgasmic-playing the piano with his penis.
I’ll point out that you couldn’t actually see, as the forefront was the piano, but you saw him with arms in air making weird faces on every note.

        I’m now starting to see the two week’s worth of propaganda affect some people close to me. Note that these are small business owners who thought the entire Shamdemic was a ridiculous overreaction.I was asked about the issue in Ukraine, and said I did not care. That I couldn’t enthusiastically support either side because I just didn’t know; but also that it is clear to me that Putin was hated long before this, so naturally all Western organs will be allied against him. I was greeted with “He’s crazy”, “What will we do about it? Sit back and let him do what he wants!”, “He may invade England!”. It was a short, but a tiresome exchange.The chance of New Hitler invading and occupying England is almost nil. But these good folk seemed convinced at the alarming spread of New Hitler’s forces, whose whereabouts when pressed they could not confirm, but whose existence is a mortal threat to their existence.That said, war propaganda is probably easier to pull than virus propaganda. The Shamdemic crushed everyone’s freedoms and closed many a small business, it was also obvious that no bodies were piling up on the streets. Hard to know what is going on at the ‘front line’ of the Struggle for Keev. So it’s small wonder people are fired up.But it is as simple as this:The organs lied and manipulated over two regarding The Shamdemic. They cannot be trusted. To take their side confidently, especially knowing The Evil of the last two years, is to continue as though nothing ever happened.But that’s just it. Too many people don’t think that The Evil inhabits The System. They think it’s all just a big, honest mistake.

            The propaganda is so fake and cringe. That is what frustrates me. I get that boomers would eat it up, but Millenials and zoomers seem to be doing so as well. We have had twenty years of government lies about war, and many Millenials went and fought and died for them. Yet it does not matter. We have had two years of nonstop lying about a cold virus, and Millenials and Zoomers both suffered tremendously for it. Yet it does not matter. Nobody has learned anything. People still eat up this capeshit-tier garbage about sunflower seeds. A sitting Congressman thought Sam Hyde was taking down Russian jets. Objectively, we are doomed.

            The patently false, fantastical nature of the propaganda shows the audience is held in very low regard, which is fully justified. Despite all the “Nazi” slurs, people in the West are more like the Imperial Japanese, who along with their wives with their babies firmly tucked under their arms, plunged to their deaths at Banzai Cliff in Saipan. This is concerning because nuclear weapons are in some of these countries, including yours and mine.

            As much as some of us we rue the immigration from (*ahem*) Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, we might also rue the Irish immigration from the late 19th. There are way too many Irish “conservatives” on TV and radio, and they have single-handedly grugged too many brains.

        As the days pass, and media barking continues, I’m expecting more American flags as I drive around my third-tier city in a state known to be full of libertarian and Christian right-wingers. I’m on the lookout for Uke flags as well. I see no such thing.
Maybe the Trumpians/GOPers who vowed never to trust the media again, are still tuning out the media? I dunno.

        I respectfully submit a fact I’m constantly reminding myself about, as well: The Cloud is TINY. We’re forever seeing studies done by people who love them some Social Media — who, indeed, routinely mistake Social Media for Real Life — that report things like “Twitter’s user base is only 30 million, of which 75% are confirmed to be bots.” With the official population of the US at something like 375 million (and I’m sure the real number is over 400), 30 million is a drop in the bucket… and 75% of that 30 million isknown to befake.(even themarketing boys,who have been caught fudging numbers more often than Dominican baseball players, say only 23% of US adults use Twitter).In other words, we’re looking at the most politically engaged segment of the population here… and they’re a tiny fraction within the tiny fraction that actually uses social media. All it’s going to take is one or two of those “people” waking up to just how isolated and outnumbered they are…(this of course presumes that our Insect Overlords are physically capable of such a realization, which is up for debate — their brains are obviously broken — but let’s be optimistic).

            Preach it. Further, the Cloud People themselves may own social media but they generally are not the small subset of actual users. Those would be mostly Blue Checks and other hangers on, generally dispensable whores and other grifters. The Grillers and Karens comprise a healthy portion of Facebook but they likely will drift away over time. Twitter is fantasy world for the wannabes and servants.

                And on top of that, the Blue Checkmarks are actively chasing away all other potential users. Gab has some huge number of people now, as does Parler and all the rest, and while it’s certainly up for debate if / the extent to which those are controlled by our friends at Quantico, what’s not debatable is the fact thatthe usersof Facebook, Twitter, etc. forced those people off. The only people left on Facebook are your grandma, who really does use it to keep up with her grandkids, and a bunch of Karens ranting at other Karens about Karen shit. Twitter, same way — Blue Checkmarks retweeting each other has to be something like 90% of their traffic now, because they’ve chased everyone else off. Soon they’ll do what Puritans always do, and start eating their own…

            Yes, their numbers are relatively few, but more importantly, they are paper tigers and will stampede when the first dominoes begin to fall.

        There is no other way to put it, most people are stupid, willfully so maybe, but dense just the same.
Neocons are just blessed with these people who can be manipulated by their fears and passions. With the neocons it’s all strategic, they have reasons. Social media obviously isn’t helping and probably fueling the retard virus among normies. Yeah Derbyshire, we truly are doomed.

        “Maybe they will start offering amnesty to J6 prisoners if they agree to wear a Ukrainian lapel pin on TV.”Nice turn of the phrase but this will not happen. For the Cloud People, the J6 political prisoners are the only enemy that matters.The disconnect between the Cloud People and reality, let alone the Dirt People, is too great to reform. While a peaceful resolution always is desired and the best way to handle anything, it is hard to imagine one. We have been, and still are, on the brink of nuclear war. People who would put others in that position will do literally anything.

                “the coal burning plants that produce their electricity”They busily are replacing their coal-burning plants with a different kind of ‘coal-burning’ plants, so to speak.The true reason that ZUSA is so enraged with Russia is that they view Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Russia as the final bastions of White European Christian people whom they wish to utterly destroy and eradicate from the globe.  They are doing this through mass immigration and population, which inevitably brings with it mass race-mixing, as well as restricting the conditions for White fertility to near zero.  Techno-driven cultural erasure is working its magic, too.  Whitey will have no place left to flee except Budapest, and you can see for yourself that they’re working on it.The plan was to draw Ukraine into NATO/EU, then flood the place with African and Muslim “refugees”.  The rest takes care of itself.  Russia would drop eventually too, and then no White person on Earth would have anywhere left to flee from the (((mudslide))).This is why Putin and Orban are Hitler: they have the committed the ultimate crime of wanting White people to exist.

            As long as you have 50 thousand plus Dollars (minimum) to blow on an EV, plus another few thousand for the charging station and installation.For all their bluffing, the US economy simply cannot afford 150 (let alone 300) Dollar a barrel oil.  Really, the global economy cannot tolerate oil that expensive.   We live in a world where most of what you buy has to be transported from one side of the globe to the other burning bunker fuel.  Those container ships burn 150 tonnes of bunker fuel a day.Even EVs might not escape the consequences of high energy prices.

                Yes, we’d need to supply gas at higher cost than Russia over a more fragile supply line.  However, that matters not since this is a small price to pay for having Europe by the balls wrt energy needs.  And that’s really the point, isn’t it?

                    It’s amazing to me how many people are supporting this.  That’s OUR gas for OUR people and nation. It’s a one time gift to us and should not be squandered.  IIRC, you lose 30% of the energy just by having to compress it (IOW, it takes 30 units of gas to compress 100 units of gas, not to mention the shipping (energy) costs).  Then there’s the economics. Once the capacity exists for mass exportation of gas, we become subject to the worldwide price of gas.

Tars.  Damn straight.  That’s why all this drill here probably won’t work–unless the free flow of oil into or out of the country is curtailed.  The *world* market sets the price of a barrel of oil drilled for and sold here under present conditions of free trade.

Modern farming is just another piece of industry and it consumes an enormous amount of gas(fertilizer) and oil (farm equipment) and electricity (pumps).  WTI (a US benchmark price for oil) is sitting at 124 Dollars a barrel!

                If you don’t believe me, look at how hard they are still pushing the “wet market” origin theory.  This recent NPR article lays out the overwhelming evidence:  1) some anonymous person posted pictures of animals at the wet market that could possibly carry the virus, and 2) some professor took swabs of some cages that the Chinese government gave him access to, and he found traces of corona.  This is all preliminary and non-peer reviewed mind you, but overwhelming nonetheless.

                DLS-
I think the Chinese ruling classes are too smart to immediately go to war over Taiwan.
Why not offer the ruling class in Taiwan a very generous and peaceful retirement package so they can be replaced with pro-CCP puppets?
Or negotiate some kind of leveraged buyout of the entire island before their US dollar denominated holdings become worthless?
I think the extreme weakness and dishonesty the US makes these scenarios much more likely.
I mean, what kind of fool would trust US rulers to honor any agreement at this point?

                    It is, but “epigenetics” states that your current environment changes your genes and passes emotional states to your kids. We’re not talking genetic mutations that can be quantified, but pure emotion.
It’s a clever way to justify black anger (as one example), because their ancestors were slaves. It’s “epigenetic”, so you know.

                        Well no one has shown how epigenetics changes the (sex) chromosomes that are passed down from one generation to another, last I read.  But its a good fall back for the environmentalist crowd.

Slightly OT, but you asked yesterday for an explanation of why South Carolina keeps Lindsey Graham in the Senate. I replied. You’ll find it on yesterday’s thread.

            karl:  Agree, and I wish I knew.  Was I  just born ornery and contrary?  I know some of my earliest memories are about repeatedly asking “Why?”  Many here have argued that various other websites are waypoints enroute to this side of the divide, but I view them more as gates and walls.  My husband was just claiming the other day that people read website ‘x’ because they can’t handle Zman until they’ve been gradually introduced to various concepts.  But the same bloggers have been pushing the same arguments for more than a quarter of a century and the same commenters are still reading those same bloggers and making the same comments they made 20 years ago.Sorta like my go-to statement to my boys – everyone grows old but most never grow up.  That’s yet another reason I find ‘veneration’ of the old distasteful.  And every time I read an insanely stupid comment about a youtube prepper video, it begins with “I’m an elderly woman” and always includes “cats.”

Very astute comment. I feel this way yet I am responsible for the well being of two elders in my circle. I take good care of them because they are my people, but one of them will never grow up.

            Karl.  Your question has been on my mind forever it seems.  Depressing thing is that “we” seem to be in the minority.  I do believe however, that as 3g4me implies, it seems to be inherent—genetic even.  I’ve always had a contrarian streak and a distrustfulness since I can remember.Here’s my earliest memory:  Way back when, I was told of the “tooth fairy” and how I should put my newly lost tooth under my pillow and she’d leave me a quarter in place of it.  Sure enough, I did so that night and got a quarter.  The next tooth, the same.However something did not seem right.   Can’t describe it, only remember it.  My next loose tooth, I pulled a bit early and told no one.  That night, *I* placed it under my pillow without telling anyone.  Next morning, no quarter.  Hummmm.So in classic experimental technique, I went to my mother an showed her the tooth and said it just came out and I’d put it under the pillow that night.  Next day I was $.25 richer—but 100% smarter!Now what f&amp;*ken 6yo thinks that way!  😉  When you find him, be nice, he’s my doppelgänger.

                Compsci:  Oh well done!  I don’t think I was that skeptical at that age, or perhaps more that I wanted to believe in something supernatural, because I already found reality (and constant familial conflict because I was so different/contrary) not as pleasant.  Same reason I gravitated to classic fiction/fantasy as a young girl.  Note I still enjoy it, but now with the deeper understanding that it echoes the reality of good versus evil and the only ‘supernatural’ I need and have is God.

                you are in the minority.most readers here are outliers.outliers are always out of sync with the majority, like cassandra warning everybody of defeat to come and so frustrated and sad because no one would pay any attention.a frenchman once said that 5% of the world are good, 5% are bad and 90% are neither here nor there.all we can do is pray.  we may never change anything.since it is  a fallen world evil eventually gets the upper hand if only for a while.history is the chronicle of all the paroxysms caused by evildoers .it is sad but inevitable.we have to do the best we can and leave the rest in God’s hands.hat better place to leave it?

        Hate to say it, but nothing substantive will change until the boomers pass on. I’ve noticed among most, though not all, of my cohort are stuck in the ’80s. Hell, I’d love to be there myself. Great time and great time to be white.

            I’m cusp, born in ’62. I’m a wondering what happens when the Boomers see the bottom drop out of there stock portfolios? No me, I’m a product of a 2nd or 3rd wave feminist legal system. I saw them vacuum up my wealth in a mid-90’s divorce.I was able to build back up OK enough, and wise and or lucky enough to have a fair amount of the assets in energy and precious metals ETF’s. Dont’ talk to me about precious metal price suppression, I always said someday reality will hit and it is looking like now is as good a time as ever. Reality is hitting. Furthermore, although I’m a lot older, they stole everything from me once, so if they do it again I’m experienced and it won’t hurt as hard as I expect it.

                Problem with holding precious metals–especially IRA’s– is that the precious metals are not in your hands–if you are talking gold/silver stock piling or such backing ETF assets.  If it’s a mine claim and machinery, well they probably are sitting on a expanding fortune.  I just remember in the 1930’s Roosevelt with a pen stroke confiscating gold.  Why not do that and confiscate the mines as well?Somewhat similar “teaching moment” happened in Argentina way back in 80’s or so. Banks supported personal accounts denominated in dollars as well as the normal peso’s.  Lots of folk in shaky countries hold foreign currency.  One day, the government said all dollar accounts are now converted to peso’s at the (government supported) current market rate.  The government told the people to “quit their bitching” as they lost nothing.  A few weeks later the government stopped supporting the peso against the dollar and the peso devalued about 20 to 1 or some horrendous amount against the dollar.
