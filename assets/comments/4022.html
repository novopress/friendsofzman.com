        Somewhat on a tangent, these days Ice T plays a cop on “Law and Order”, and pushes a ‘reality’ show with his wife, all peace and love among the upper crust.Another one of those “So when did the posing start?” jobs. The other question is, does it ever stop?

        If there’s a silver lining in here, maybe this will put an end to all the media reports on in Ferguson. My guess is though, that this incident will be conveniently relegated to page 20 by tomorrow, because it doesn’t advance the narrative of black victimhood in America.

        Does anyone know if it was a pistol or a rifle bullet?
A pistol from 500 feet seems silly.

        I have a theory (stop me if you have heard this one before) that people like Obama are just victims too, but in a different way. Your El Presidente isn’t it seems to me a strong person. Just like a piece of driftwood, he gets swept along by some mysterious force. The momentum of the society he thinks is possibly okay sustains him. Such a momentum benefits him, I have no doubt (it is hard to see where else people like him could make a good living in the normal world) and he doesn’t want it to end anytime soon.The man has the comfort for the moment of being reasonably liked by a chunk of the US population and is propped up by a particularly cowardly media, but in a way he is a victim. Obama can’t change what is in motion, and though he may have encouraged it — to continue the analogy, by not making waves — he can do nothing but go along with it now.For the man to say at this juncture “This is not seemly. This is not the way we do things” would make him appear like a man waking up from a bad night’s sleep and seeing the dawn. But it would alienate him from his future income base. Better for his future prospects (book tours, speaking engagements, paid-for travel and the like) to make small comments — small-minded, some might say — and thus continue to be just another piece of flotsam in the west’s growing list of washed ups.

            The religious tend to believe their own gospels. American Progressives have been talking about the end of white rule in America for fifty years. Liberalism descended into a revenge fantasy in the late 60’s and never really recovered. Obama, marinated in this since birth, probably looks at these developments with glee.But your point is well taken. His cult is unforgiving of apostates and heretics. The hundreds of millions waiting for him in the coming years depends on his fulfilling his duties as the flag bearing of racial justice.My read on Obama is he went a lot further than he ever imagined possible. He probably thought he would top out as a Congressman, shucking and jiving for the Democrats when called upon, but otherwise living a comfortable life as a member of the minor nobility.But, the cult was putting on a new show and he was perfect for the lead role. Like a starlet discovered by Hollywood, he went from nobody to bigshot in no time. He’s smart enough to know he has a good deal and there’s no need to over think it.

        Conflating the Huey Newton quote with the Reuters report looks intentional, yes?

            Yes, the Huey Newton quote was artistic license. I just wanted to highlight that we have seen this film before and it always ends the same way.
