        UKER:  absolutely correct, in the end, these people always take more than they contribute.  Solvency is a fig leaf – its always about kicking the can down the road.  The Therapeutic-Welfare State becomes its own justification.  Here in the U.S. the Obama program has been about hooking what’s left of the middle and working classes on the government tit; as Rahm Emmanuel stated, never let a crisis go to waste.  Even the great libertarian project of drug legalization has been coopted in order to increase the dependency class and its need for attendant government regulation and programs.  To paraphrase Dean Wormer from ANIMAL HOUSE, fat, high, and stupid is no way to go through life, but it is a good recipe to keep the elites in power over a slavish, drug addled, and pop-entertainment besotted mass.

        We in the U.S. have already taken way more than I would have ever thought, so my predictions about the future have been off. I never thought we’d tolerate the surveillance that we do.
We are also about one generation down the lunatic left road. We do, however, have one difference, at least so far, and that’s the Second Amendment. I don’t think the South Yorkshire Police would be alive in most areas of the U.S., if they allowed this to happen.

        Joseph K: interesting point about welfare but the problem with welfare systems (and the attendant socialised health schemes like our bloated NHS) is they require continual maintenance and vast amounts of money pumped in to pay all the managers filling out pointless forms. Politics is mostly in the UK about how big welfare is, how generous the benefits and the all-powerful NHS so there can be no room for small government. Big hand-out organisations require very big government offices and ever more regulations to fuss over them.Many asian immigrants to the UK bring ageing families in their wake who need benefits and health care, and their tendency to marry their immediate cousins has huge implications for the health care and education system. Plus they too pipe money out of the country; local shops have facilities for wiring UK money to all sorts of places in Pakistan and perhaps Taliban areas. Who knows?I think Europe (and Britain after all is merely a ‘region’ of a great socialist empire rooted in Brussels and Strasbourg under Berlin’s guidance) likes lots of welfare dependents because it justifies their ‘policies.’ When you are arguing how poor people are who were given only a 40″ plasma TV as opposed to those who had to buy a 28″ plasma TV for themselves, you can see why the EU and its slave states lick their lips at the prospect of more welfare.

        Europe and the Brits allowed massive immigration in order to stave off the inevitable collapse of the welfare state apparatus due to their aging populations and demographic collapse.  The same thing is happening in the U.S.  Amnesty will legalize the 20 million already here, allowing them to pay into the system and support the boomers’ retirement.  The border will be left open to let 20 million more in to keep wages down and stave off inflation.  Our rulers also like the fact that Latin immigrants tend to send most of their earning back home, rather than spend it here, which also helps keep inflation under control.Of course, that doesn’t help the rest of us.  The economy stays stagnant when most job growth goes to immigrants, because there is no trickle down when the trickle ends up in Honduras.  Hospitals and schools are overburdened, while formerly decent neighborhoods deteriorate.  The only benefit I see is that the Latins tend to be better behaved than the native blacks that they are displacing.

        I have connections with Rotherham; it is a singularly unlovely town that once made a living in the days of steel and coal but now has nothing to offer.It has, I am led to believe, a toxic pro-left culture in local government. As with all left-leaning organisations it makes noises about ‘the people’ but openly despises them. When a Rotherham family dared to make it known that they were going to vote UKIP (a party that wants Britain to be separate from the even more toxic EU) they had their children taken off them and put into care. After all, nothing is more damaging to a child than finding out its parents do not want to bow down to the mighty Brussels bureaucracy.Whenever I happen to go to Rotherham I see there are lots of asians on the streets and it is hard not to look at them and think perhaps some of them were active in the massive child abuse scandal. I doubt if it is was just the handful jailed.The Labour party handed a lot to the asians who came to England and the present government, as disgustingly left-leaning as Blair was despite their supposed title as Tories, is just as complicit. Labour gave the immigrants postal votes so the local imam could collect the unmarked papers and fill them out to help all those who don’t speak English. Or don’t want to. The Tories could have reversed this appalling scheme but choose not to.More asians and middle-east/Africans are coming to Britain every year no matter what, so no need to wish for Britain to import even more. They are coming and places like London now have areas that are little more than third-world hell-holes complete with posters declaring areas of the capital to be Sharia zones in which gangs of asians patrol the streets to dish out what they consider justice.Rotherham believes it is good for the local people, but it is like all these places steeped in the strange nonsensical beliefs that diversity is good for the locals. Well, good for all but around 1,400 young girls.Is it coming to America? Only you can say. But what I have seen here fills me with dread: the schools in places like Rotherham have huge numbers of asian boys. When they grow up they are going to want women to amuse them and then they find the money is running out. My expectation is they will take to the streets, aided and abetted by dhimmi local councils and a weak, PC-obsessed police force.You may worry about Mexicans, but at least they aren’t of the so-called Religion of Peace.
