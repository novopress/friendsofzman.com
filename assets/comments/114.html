        Just wanted to say that I enjoyed this post.  I was a teenager in the 1990s so my youth coincided with generally good economic years but I think I would look back at my youth with fondness regardless of the economic circumstances.
As to whether several years from now we’ll look back at today with fondness: I always felt that the 2008-2009 meltdown wasn’t the final blow up before we enjoy a long period of strong economic growth.  I wish it was, but history suggests that real financial bottoms can go much lower.
