        I’m a boomer in the mid-70s who was always a dissident. Everything I saw in my misspent youth conveyed to me the idea of cultural and social rot. No matter how much I was horrified at developments in the 60s and 70s, the idiots around me seemed to nod and go along with whatever Uncle Walter intoned every weekday evening. It was sickening. I kept telling myself that the only thing that could turn things around was complete collapse. Reagan got my hopes up. The Bush Family dashed them. And from the depths of despair, a real estate magnate from Queens, NY arises from the political heap to lead us to renewal. Read that last sentence again. Yeah, it’s an actual counterrevolution, and I never saw it coming…and could not have conceived of it five years ago.

            Outside of a tight circle, it seems no one knew what was about to unfold. A note of caution is in order in that the military has not been adequately purged yet and that could prove a problem.

                True. However, the lethal end of it is massively disgruntled. Watch Sean Ryan’s interview of Pete Hegseth.I think ZMan said it best a few weeks back. To paraphrase, ‘given what is happening, it is most likely that things are far worse than anyone knows.’Even Con Inc guys like Claremont were saying the empire had an extremely weak hand and postulated that somewhere inside the Regime, those not having butt orgies, snatching purses, twerkin’ in Ghana … … were maybe considering doing a deal with China that wasn’t to our advantage.Clearly America’s empire is retreating and establishing a new territorial and functional scope. We should be very excited. I am very excited for Europe. Vance’s speech and Musk’s tweets could be a prelude to an inversion of the order over there. Jailed dissidents and suppressed dissidents whose views are in line with the emerging American imperial regime, could find themselves with a lot of support from them.They can’t have China or Arabia/Turkey flood in and take it over. It is in their interests to find men to step up and move in a completely different direction.Of course, that language also bolsters our cause here at home. I think there is opportunity everywhere to step into power vacuums and take the reins at local levels in business, politics, civic endeavors. We got a stay of execution, and we should all be doing something to make the most of it.

                    Spot on. Despite my misgivings about Musk and the Tech Bros, they are so far into the revolution that they seem required to go balls to the walls or have their heads on pikes. It is inevitable that things were worse than even the godawfulness we knew. Opportunities will abound barring a military coup, which cannot be fully discounted just yet. The ideal situation, of course, would be states like California and New York seceding and being sent the aliens they foisted on everyone else.

                        If they secede can we invade them and make them into territories? it would allow all of the leaders to be banished to Gitmo. The regular people left would be very happy. oh the possibilities.

                                The future US cannot surrender California. Americans bled to take it from Mexico, enormous human and capital resources went into its development, what happens to its abundant natural resources, harbors, and road/rail nets is not a matter for the freaks inhabiting the coastline and hordes of illegals to dispose of by voting, it belongs to all of us.
Six months after indeoendence, the PLA Navy would be homported in San Diego and San Francisco Bay.

                            Then we’d be stuck with all their illegal aliens. When it comes time for the blue states to secede, that’s probably the bargain we’ll have to make: they get to go, and in exchange we get to rid ourselves of all those wogs. Their problem, not ours.
If we’re smart about it, we’ll keep the agricultural areas of CA and let them have the coast. They might be dumb enough to go for that.

                                This assumes that the Central Valley is not Mexsquatimalonduralombia already. If farming is done by bot that could change. Sadly, I think California is lost as far as the foothills demographically.Interestingly is the huge amount of emergent military/aerospace tech that is taking root in the LA Basin. The tool/machining and remnants of aerospace from The Golden State are a great ecosystem that they are moving into. It is almost entirely white. Perhaps that could split with SanFrancisco/Sacramento. Of course, the LA government is totally hopeless.Any way. I babble on. There is a lot to be optimistic about. A rift has opened in the continuum and we are only beginning to reach a point where many things can now be said. We are very close to it, and Konstantin Kisin trying his hardest to hold back the dam is not going to do it. He already failed with the Woke right. He is trying to hold back the British racial/ethnic identitarianism. Muh oligarch in asylum “British” values are just like the Woke. Money and inorganic mass support are going to wither and crumble slowly and then all at once.May Trump destroy enemy castles and may we build as fast as we can.

                    Like many here, I would love to see a renewal of traditional “Western” values in Western Europe (and here in the colonies, for that matter!)However…Until the UK stops imprisoning ordinary citizens, sometimes for years, for the “crime” of saying something on social media that here might be considered impolite, or even get them kicked off Facebook or even Musk’s X,Until Germany does little better, but also is trying to outlaw one of that nation’s political parties,Until several of these nations can bring themselves to admit that mass immigration to their homelands is not in the best interests of the legacy citizenry,Until…Well, you get the point. We live in exciting times to be sure. But as your Z quote implies, things may be far worse than they seem on the surface. A variant of that idea is the hypothesis that one faction of The Plutocracy got alarmed enough at the lunacy of the other faction(s) that they stepped up as Trump supporters. Being a parasite on the host is all well and good for Faction A, but unlike Faction B, they are smart enough to know that if the host weakens and dies, everybody dies.

                It seems, and just a guess, that the military problem is mostly at the top to near top, and less of a problem as you go down the ranks.
Question is, if orders conflict, would the lower rank take his orders from his immediate supervisor or Commander in Chief?

                    Unlike banana republics and even some better ones, like MX.  The power of the military is not primal/complete.  The States have their National Guard, and the municipalities, local police powers.  Coupled with guns up the wazoo in the hands of the populace, the federal army would have its hands full if the States officially joined in civil disobedience, i.e., rebellion.  A military coup of sorts against Trump would be a nightmare to maintain.

                    c matt: “It seems, and just a guess, that the military problem is mostly at the top to near top, and less of a problem as you go down the ranks.“I dunno; I’m seeing an helluva lotta Cluster B in the Military, amongst the young-n-fertiles [aged maybe 18 to 42].Cluster B is destroying everything in its path.It’s damned near impossible to get any constructive work done, nor any reliable relationships forged, when Cluster B is the reigning psychological flavor du jour.All y’all older folks, who don’t hafta deal with the Anti-Social Personality Disorder &amp; the Narcissism &amp; the Solipsism &amp; the Histrionics &amp; the apoplectic Borderline rage; ya’ll who don’t see that on a daily basis, y’all don’t have any idea how poisonous the culture has become for young people.The young people serving in the Military are necessarily a product of the ambient culture, and the ambient culture has opened up Pandora’s Box and ruined countless at-risk personalities.Point being that as bad as the problem is “At the Top”, it might be even far worse, down at the bottom.PS: I hope I’m wrong, but almost all I witness anymore is Cluster B mowing down everything in its path.And that’s before you even throw Passive Aggression into the Witch’s Brew.

                Trump keeps exempting them from the hiring freezes and RIFs…that is a big problem.
A lot of troublemakers in the bureaucracy will flood into vacancies in DOD which already has an oversupply of shiftless do nothings.

            None of us saw this coming. I held out more hope for Trump than the Dissidents and was often criticized for doing so. Not criticizing – they had ample ammo for their arguments and stance.But I am (was) a businessman too. To succeed against the rot in Noo Yawk, Trump had to deal with extremely shitty people like the Clintons and other red tape/politically correct raiders and buccaneers. The cost of doing that, personal and financial – would have been horrendous.In business I have seen it a hundred times – where instead of bad deals go from “the cost of doing business” to personal vendettas. I watched mutually lucrative deals with key account customers go to being protracted wars BFYTW. Usually both sides suffered as result and everybody lost.Blumpf is literally in a no-lose situation here. The parasites are close to killing the host. Mr. Normie and Mr. Griller are watching the real big game now, instead of the sportzball on TV. They know they have skin in this game. It’s one of the reasons I love Americans. Say what you want – when they see problems they will deal with them…eventually.Canadians, on the other hand…

                I’m starting to think that Trump being cheated out of the election in 2020 was ultimately a good thing for him and America. Instead of 4 more years as a lame duck POTUS, he was able to walk away and kindle his anger into a stone cold revenge machine.

                    2020 was 08 but worse because the problems of 08 have only grown exponentially.  If Trump is smart, he’ll rip off the bandaid, take the sharp deep recession, and hopefully have some healing before his term is over to help whoever runs after him.  No bailouts, no 0% rates, then i’ll take him seriously.

                        It would be a fake recession, though. GDP is a crappy unit of measurement, made specifically to trick people into thinking any reduction in government spending is a terrible, terrible thing.
In reality, who cares if DC and NoVa housing collapses? Who cares if saving for retirement is so easy you no longer need to pay someone to manage it for you?
Until we start using a real measure of our economic output, something like Net Private Production, they will continue to win the battles using semantics.

                            “they will continue to win the battles using semantics.”Disagree, they’re coming to the end of kicking the can.  Nature will force what they’ve been trying to put off, unless resources aren’t finite.  Making the stock market the countries retirement account was always stupid, and i have no sympathy for those who can’t or won’t think for themselves.  They were only able to do what they did in 08 and again in 2020 because the rest of the world didn’t have an alternative.  Everyone here is saying boy trump really did some planning and thank god he lost in 2020, you don’t think Russia and China have been doing the same?  They control the minerals, they control the production, the EU and US can trade their only fan pics back and forth, great economy 😉

Yeah, I agree that may not have been the best pick. I’m just hoping that Marx was at least right about first as a tragedy, second as farce. Only by completely discrediting the agency is there a possibility of getting rid of it.

        Dude, for a political junkie / commentator, the first 30 days of Trump 2.0 have been like dying and going to Heaven. I’ve never had so much fun and it seems neither have you. Party on Wayne!

        “Most of the money gets sent to the states via grants and subsidies.”
Wherever it ends up, it’s just squandered on bureuacracy, paperwork, woke studies, committee meetings, and subsidies to tech giants in “education” like Apple and Texas Instruments. None of it goes to anything useful. The Department of Education should just be shuttered. The USA is dying of bureaucracy.

            Sometimes I like to compare these government agencies to corporations just to put things into perspective. $250 billion of revenue puts you at tenth on the Fortune list. But of course, the DOE doesn’t DO anything, they don’t build anything, they don’t make anything, not even in the abstract way a FIRE company does and makes things, so they need “only” 3900 employees to shuffle papers and distribute money around. Normally companies that produce that much revenue have at least 50,000 employees if not hundreds of thousands or Amazon and Walmart who both have over a million. You’ll often see government shills talk about these numbers as a way of stressing the fed’s “low” headcount but it is really a distraction that gets away from the real issue.

        It has been airbrushed out of history, but early Mussolini’s Italy inspired much of the New Deal. The National Recovery Act of 1933 was based directly on fascist economics. It elevated a new elite and punished the old.As for today, what was a rogue elite a year ago is the rising elite today. The economic reforms are as much about who/whom as they are about profits and efficiency. The sclerotic system being dismantled now was discredited by easily exposed fraud and theft and attention drawn to the funding of the majority’s dispossession. The sovereign wealth fund is one of several ways power is being stripped from the Administrative State and transferred to its replacement. In time, these replacements will use the same means and methods deployed by something such as USAID–rewarding friends, punishing enemies. Carl Schmitt smiles somewhere. These are not our peopleper seand in time may be outright adversarial, but as things stand they are not hostile and even are helpful.The so-called “Reagan Revolution” was a tweak of the status quo. This is a revolution.

                Mussolini was broadly popular before the Ethiopia thing and then his love affair with Hitler. He should have listened to his lieutenant Italo Balbo, who advocated a British alliance as in WWI.

                    Pre 1939, certain Nazi German ideas were welcomed in the US. Nazi academics toured and gave lectures about eugenics. German airships provided an interesting alternative to ship travel until the unfortunate incident in 1937. IBM sold them business machines for…well, never mind.

                Somewhat. Along with the Tech Bros, foreign policy people such as Witkoff who transitioned from the private real estate sector, and new financial thinkers such as Bessent are “these,” and they are the new elite. If you are indicating they were previously powerful, yes, of course, that’s how it always works. Power seeks more power.

                    I’m just trying to figure out who the players on the field are and who is fighting whom.
A rough way to characterize who is being attacked is anyone who had any  contact with USAID.
But who is attacking them and why?
I feel like a lowly Greek peasant in ancient times watching helplessly as the gods fight it out in the sky.

                        Well put.  I was not aware of many of the names and I’m still uncomfortable with quite a few of them (Bessent being a homosexual, for example) but I’m trying to separate policy from personality – although that itself varies tremendously  based on the individual.  One thing I have noticed are the names/sexes/races of those who actively oppose Trump’s changes – and I know I unquestionably want to see them lose.  Example – DOJ lawyers (extrapolate ethnicities,religion, sex, nationally and hate lawyers even more):https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open_Letter_to_Federal_Prosecutors__2-18-2025_.pdf

                            Those of us who believe that ethnicity and sexual perversion command more loyalty than professed values don’t have much to say right now because of the rapidity of Trump’s fuselage.
I’m starting to hear the same old arguments that we can ally ourselves with j3ws, non-whites, and perverts because some small fraction of them are supporting Trump.
I’m always willing to revise my beliefs, but I fully expect my belief that “ethnicity &gt; values” to eventually be vindicated.
I try to remind people that the palecons thought they could ally with the neocons and they got destroyed.

                                Totally agree.  I enjoy the firings and the discovery of graft, but the scope is in no way surprising to me, and it’s not the same as actual budget cuts, as Mr. House notes.  Of course, we don’t have budgets, we have ‘continuing resolutions.’  We’ll see if anything changes with that.And yes, I think the ‘allies of convenience’ thing is being massively overplayed.  Sure, maybe the techbros got tired of being dictated to by bureaucrats, but their global AI future is not one I want (and Trump’s backing of IVF – beloved by Musk, leftists, and queers worldwide) is horrifying.  I’m watching and waiting, but in no way relaxing or celebrating.

                                    Trump made a campaign promise about IVF. He is not a Christian nor a social conservative, which the Christian Right has chosen to ignore considering the alternatives. He made a  deal with the CR to appoint conservative SCOTUS members and that was enough to gain their support. He also seems to be against the whole trans thing (as is Musk), so that is another plus.

                                        I know Trump isn’t a social conservative.  I don’t care about SCOTUS judges (they all suck) but I was not aware he made a campaign promise about IVF.  I abhor all these artificial intrusions into conception, along with surrogacy and rent-a-wombs.  So now I’ll get downvoted by all the saad womyns who couldn’t have kids, or whose sister’s cousin couldn’t, or whose neighbor couldn’t.  My best friend couldn’t, and she refused all the Frankenstein options.  As I said earlier, sometimes life sucks.  Deal with it.

                            Good stuff. Thank you for the link. It highlights the failure of the conservative, to think that all they have to do to fix things is to pass some laws and issue some orders.
Conservatives squandered any moral authority that might have been obeyed about 75 years ago, or longer. No one on this Earth cares what they think. Inveterate and invertebrate fecklessness has removed unleaded solutions from the toolkit, and we are all going to be worse off because of it.

                        Almost all revolutions are led by the powerful and elites who are lesser in statue than those in command and whom they wish to topple. There have been a few exceptions such as the Bolshevik Revolution, but when you drill down even its leaders would pass at least as Upper Middle Class. This was supposed to be something like the Thermidorian Reaction but has become revolutionary. Since apparently the intelligence services are under control and the propaganda organs are discredited, the only fly in the ointment is the military, which traditionally has put down revolutionary governments. Franco would be a good example there although arguably his reaction became somewhat revolutionary.

                            I don’t see the military as a real risk. Their people are our people. The MAGA mob is filled with ex-military. Trump could field ten million patriots in a very short time. A coup would backfire on the establishment and accelerate the rate of change by removing the resistance by force. The average American is pissed at the people who have driven this country in the ditch. Unleashing the rage would be something to see.
You never want to fight someone who is certain they are in the right. They will fight to the last man.

                                The top-level military are still Obama-Biden hangovers. They are probably too incompetent to stage a successful coup but we shouldn’t take a chance. They need to go.

                                I am not sure the senior military leaders are “our people.” Too many of them got rank under Obama and Biden. I think many of them should retire (or else!).

                                    One way to get rid of them is to reorganize.  Shrink the command structure by two thirds and you immediately get rid of the bulk of the four starts.  From there, you can work in your own people. I suspect something like that is even “on the table” in the Trump back room.

                                            But that would leave a lot of replacements in a hurry and perhaps push resistance from top brass.  Be sneaky about it, sell it as cost savings and strengthening “homeland” defense.  And really, WWII started with I believe 7 four stars and was pretty consistent throughout the war in such scarcity of command structure—even with what, 12M servicemen?

                                        You are correct. Today Hegseth announced the military has been directed to make 8% budget cuts yearly for five years, exempting certain programs. That means personnel cuts and fewer generals and admirals (we have a superfluity).

Popular conservative opinion.
Those ten million would make an attractive target for several A-10 Warthogs. The army of deer rifles is simply a leaderless mob waiting to be slaughtered by professionals.
Hegseth needs to form a new leadership cadre and ease the dangerous ones into a generous retirement.

                            I put the probability of a coup two weeks ago at 50:50. When I heard about the Blackhawk crash my first thought was, “Was Pete Hegseth on board?”. That Tulsi and RFK got through the Senate has me a bit more confident, but the purge of the four stars hasn’t started yet.The good news is that the people most likely to stage a coup are the same people who ran the withdrawal from Afghanistan. A coup would (hopefully) be like the August 1991 USSR coup, yesterday’s men exposed before the nation and opposed by the colonels and Team Trump.But the danger will exist until the current Pentagon crowd is broken up, I suppose this has been left for last because it will be hardest. We had seven four stars commanding twelve million men in 1945, today we have FOURTY FOUR commanding 450,000. What those 44 do in their abundant spare time is unknown. Bet on the Preakness? Manage Site Y?Idle hands are the devil’s playground.

Well, to be honest, the Vanguard is led by the Usual Suspects*, but they do have a knack for that. “These are not our peopleper seand in time may be outright adversarial, but as things stand they are not hostile and even are helpful.”

                    The Usual Suspects have a knack for knowing which way the wind is blowing. They are, per usual, acting more as remoras than as leaders. And some of those Usual Suspects are a rogue elite within their ingroup. Witzkoff is a good example. In addition to the Tech Bros, there are new financial elites coming onboard.

                        “…acting more as remoras than as leaders.”Hmm. By gum, I think you might be right. For instance, yes they could bend our innovations, such as Fink with his Aladdin AI for market trends…but they didn’tinventsuch innovations. That’s true for just about anything we made that was turned against us.The shortness (and thus effective practicality) of their vision is based on tikkun olam. Talmud, and thus talmudic praxis, is not more than a giant casebook ofhow to get around the rules.No real innovation there, so…And reaching Mars? Nope. The messianic End Time vision is merely the Perfected World, Resurrected- this world the same, except themselves in charge as an immortal tribe.No Heaven, nor urge to Mars either.

As for tikkun, neither the ‘reformed’ Jews nor anybody else has the power to repair a world under God’s curse.  We can do good works, certainly.
But it is hubris to imagine we are sufficient to ‘fix everything’ because, y’know, we’re just so wise and wonderful.
The talmud is a bunch of rabbis pretending to be God.  That’s what ya get for hanging around Babylon.

                        If you’re talking about the crypto-bros as part of the new financial elite, many of them are well aware that “green energy” will not power their crypto mining operations. There are of course types of cryptocurrency that do not rely on energy intensive “proof of work” but Bitcoin and most of the other popular coins do. I’m sure a lot of crypto-bros could easily envision a world where electricity costs put a permanent damper on the crypto-economy the same way European green policies have suffocated heavy industry there.

                It’s a new elite attempting the supplant the old elite. Musk, Trump and the other billionaires realized that they were seen as below the managerial class. They would never really run things. The same was true for the upcoming political class such as Vance and King Cobra. They’d never be anything more than glorified lawn jockeys.
The billionaire class teamed the savvy political troops (Vance, etc.) to take on the Deep State/managerial class. The battle has begun. We’ll see who wins.

                    Don’t discount fear. The billionaires obviously have much to lose and the socioeconomic trajectory frightened them. The nomenklatura had to be ousted before it began to hit them harder to keep up their lifestyles. Something I never thought I would write since he is so loathsome: Yarvin was spot on about the people running the show and the need to buy them out.

                            Right. At a local level, observe the machinations now to oust Eric Adams as NYC mayor, and think about the people who have financial houses on Wall Street. They either will have to orchestrate a statewide Color Revolution or bug out in such a way that the State Attorney General Letecia James can’t grab their wealth.

            Jack offers fairly sober reflections. I will pass on a comment that seems wise, probably because somebody else said it: Beyond all doubt many of Roosevelt’s programs were straight from the socialism playbook, but that writer explained by saying Socialist candidates were gaining in popularity in that era, and the Democrats co-opted to some degree their proposals. E.g. central planning of agriculture is bad when the Communists did it, but it makes perfectly good sense to lift us out of the depression. Left unsaid was that it was a new way to funnel money from the government to private interests, Big Agriculture in that case.I’ll admit I know little of sovereign wealth funds. I’m aware that some small nations known for (by world standards) low corruption have these, such as Norway. No matter, I simply can’t envision how such a proposal wouldnotinvite all manners of abuse. E.g. “The Federal Government taking a direct ownership (and thus shareholder voting rights) in the world’s largest corporations – what could possibly go wrong?” (Yes, such exist in various forms and have for decades, witness CALPERS etc. But none of those have the printing press.)As The Ooo famously noted, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

        As we learn that the lying and the thieving was worse than anyone imagined, it also becomes clear why no one in the GOP is publicly challenging anything Trump is doing.They are all terrified.  And with good reason.Tip O’Neill was wrong: there are times when politics is not local.  And this is one of those times.In 2026, a national primary camapaign could be waged by the administration against every sitting Republican, and it revolves around the challenger endlessly repeating a simple three-part question:“Were you too stupid to understand the corruption, were you too cowardly to do anything about it, or were you in on it?”Repeat that in 218 races, including Speaker Johnson’s.Imagine Elon putting a measly $2 billion behind all of this, a mere $10 mil per race, and you could produce the biggest turnover of sitting officeholders in history.Cue the Safaris’ “Wipe Out”Then you run that same campaign message against every sitting Democrat and throw another $10 mil in chump change into every marginal district…

            Elon, and even Trump, are pretty agnostic politically (and who ca blame them), so stacking the Democratic party with more Dick Gephardts and fewer Mullah Omars would suit their purposes just fine.

            I’ve concluded much the same- Trump either has dirt on these slimeball republicans or he has given the impression that he does- and that terrifies them. He just needs to imply that he’ll pay to primary them and most will fall right in line, and then take out a handful and replace with loyalists. Boom, Trump’s got a congress that will back him up. Everyone is just assuming that Trump is done after 2 years and will inevitably lose congress, but if he has the goods- and Musk’s hinting about checking into people with low salaries becoming millionaires suggests he does- then this is some powerful leverage. This is some boss level moves!

                        I think they realize Trump outfoxed them. That’s probably why they used wind-up toys to try to strike fear of death into him. Why not a competent assassin? Trump is not that stupid. He’s alive for the same reason Snowden is — deadman switches. So long as he’s alive, you know there’s worse to drop.
Obviously, I don’t know it’s the Epstein files. Whatever it is, it’s enough to instill fear into the recalcitrant Rs and even some Ds. It’s not simple corruption — DOGE has already made it plain there’s not going to be any way to hide .

        It’s becoming very clear that Trump and his team are going big – like FDR big. They are attempting to reshape the economic and political order both at home and abroad. I have no clue if they’ll succeed, but you have to love the moxie.I’d keep an eye on Treasury Sec. Bessent. That guy knows trade and currencies. (He actually worked with Soros.) He’s fully aware of the impact of reducing the trade deficit will have on the Eurodollar system. Hint: Not good. You can bet that they are looking to reorder not just the global trade system but the global financial system.

            Yes. I don’t think even the most committed MAGA elements could have predicted what is underway. This obviously was planned over years and based on intimate knowledge of the weaknesses in the current system. What is shocking is how close to the vest this restructuring was held. Project 2025 was a social issues distraction while the most radical changes in the economic system plausible were planned. Also amazing is the political acumen involved to discredit the old and to usher in the new. This most certainly was not a Hail Mary. As you point out, it is an open question as to whether it works, but what was the norm a month ago is not coming back.

                Agreed. I’m stunned the plan and execution, but I’m completely blown away by the secrecy. Nobody saw this coming. How did they work for years to build this plan and nobody hinted about it much less leaked it. Truly amazing.

                    I can’t think of anything that even comes close in regard to the secrecy. It may have been doable only because the key players largely were not part of the Blob and the old D.C. establishment. The next shoe to drop likely will be prosecutions based on financial fraud. If that take is right, it accomplishes two goals: 1. payback and retribution; and 2. consolidation of power for the new elite. Amazing times.

                        Agreed on the secrecy.  But consider all the effort most of us have needed to put into concealing our political views from normies let alone crazies.  Feeling people out before coming close to freely expressing ourselves.  Also consider that many of the architects of this revolution were (are?) probably high up in organizations that would have hurled them into the void at the slightest hint of this level of extreme heresy.
Under these circumstances the amazing stealth makes sense.

                    I too am stunned.  However, I am also heartened.  What is the common denominator we find with all these leaks and leakers?  They benefit the leaker.  In short, leakers are in “it” for themselves!  They are scum and traitors.  ‘Men without chests” as C.S. Lewis sagely penned almost a century ago.
To me, no leaks indicates a truly dedicated cadre in the works—and of course that is the first requirement for true change to occur.

                    I’m not. Corporate takeovers involve lots of people, too, and their cover is rarely blown. Even when you know who is likely looking to pull one, and you put cameras everywhere, including up his rectum, it still comes as a surprise.
The secrecy thing is something we’ve been indoctrinated to believe. They want us to think that, and we do. Because it lets them get away with it, since so few are willing to accept that it was too big to keep secret.

                And people say Q followers like me were falling for a psy-op? I can’t say that I understood every step they were going to take in full detail, but so far everything Trump has done is something that was covered in the so-called “conspiracy” world. Elimination of the income tax isn’t going to be a surprise to me and neither are tariffs.
If I’m surprised by anything it’s that he has a pretty good chance of succeeding. I thought he was going to need more Congressional authorization to make things happen.

                    Q may have been turning the Regime’s own techniques against them, which is to say putting out outlandish and disqualifying information to distract from the things actually being done somewhat along the same lines. As for congressional approval, the system was so degraded and debased that it has become easily circumvented. Congress largely is a ceremony now.

                        Did not follow Q much, but another technique frequently used is to put something seemingly outlandish “out there” to make it part of the discourse.  Once part of the discourse, it moves from unthinkable, to thinkable, and then hopefully further on to possible, etc.

            I figured he would when he selected Pete Hegseth for SecDef. I saw an interview with him where he was questioned about geostrategy and it was clear he didn’t know a thing.This is not a criticism of the man. When one reaches his level of rank one has specialized in one or more proficiencies. Douglas McGregor, for example, is a warrior scholar with deep learning in geostrategy. He, like Hegseth, is a killer and a leader of socially cooperative killers. He is NOT a paperpushing fop like everyone who has been in that office for the last 30 years.If Pres. Trump had simply wanted ‘more of the same’ tinkering around the edges reform he would have picked someone else. He picked Hegseth to coup proof his government. If the rat people go kinetic against Pres. Trump, I expect them to be energetically stacked like cordwood to the cheers of the world.Why the world and not just Americans? The widespread crime that is being revealed now is far more than mere transgressions against law, but given the scale and the collaboration of the leadership of both parties, constitutes an ongoing war against the American people by an organized transnational cartel. Furthermore, because the people organizing and profiting from the crime have used America to attack the rest of the world, it is not just Europeanity that has an interest in seeing the madness brought to an end, but all of humanity.Yes, I fully expect that when the last lead is followed and the last node in the last network is rolled up, it will be seen in hindsight to have been a predominately ‘special’ operation, with the longstanding pattern of 10-30% indigenous collaborators. Let the cards fall where they may, then let the headsman’s axe falls where it is needed.

                My guess (only a guess or suspicion) is that the elite internecine war is between the financiers vs. the manufacturers.  The global system as now existing is good to OK for the manufacturers, but phenomenal for the financiers.  The manufacturers don’t like it and want a better balance.

                    If the manufacturers don’t like it, why did they close their American factories and ship the equipment to China and Mexico?  Plus, now that some manufacturers are leaving China, why are they relocating to India and Vietnam and other Asian countries, along with Mexico and not re-shoring back to the US?

                But their power is mostly that we all accept the idea that they have power. Someone in the last couple days made a reference to Braveheart. When he’s on his avenging rampage, he meets the ministers gaze and turns his eyes down in the natural reaction, submission. Then the veil lifts, and he sees the minister as the vile thing that he is, and slashes his throat. That’s all that need happen.
Étienne de La Boétie had it pegged. That should become required reading.

            “…the impact of reducing the trade deficit will have on the Eurodollar system.”Will that mean more scraps of paper flooding back into the US, or not enough floating around out there?
I realize tariffs will likely be offset by the forex, that is, their currencies will get cheaper to compensate thus maintaining a pretty even keel, but that’s as far as my limited understanding goes.
What do you think could happen? Will our SS or welfare go kaput, cannibal hordes raiding the AI centers for copper for their axes and fresh meat?

                I don’t know that reducing the trade deficit is going to have that big of an effect. We don’t have much exportable to trade, and what we are trading away, we should not be.
Let’s say tariffs worked as hoped, and we can make $5 widgets. The $3 widgets are still available from China or Indonesia or somewhere, so why would Germans buy our stuff at a 66% premium?
Tariffs put you into a death spiral. Sell out the future for a benefit today.

                    That’s the traditional thought from traditional economists, and given conditions of the time, correct.  However, nothing says that tariffs are immutable and cannot be negotiated away when such is favorable to the US economy.  Additionally, perhaps some added expense is justifiable in the name of national security.  It’s not either/or.  It’s degrees.  An example is automobile production where any number of countries require factories or parts to be manufactured within their country in order to sell such within their borders.

                    We already have a large trade deficit with Germany.Trade should only be for goods which both countries have a good they are more efficient producing for natural reasons like climate or resource availability.  This is not the system of trade we have today.  The advantage China has over the US is the lack of enforced regulations, an artificially cheap Yuan and a very low standard of living in China.  With capital and goods free to move around, manufacturers naturally seek a market to make their goods with low costs and a market to sell those goods with high costs.When all this economic rationalization stuff was being worked out, there was a gold standard and capital was nowhere as free to move as it is now.  The idea that a country could run 5 decades of ever increasing trade deficits on net was unthinkable.  Any country that tried would have their currency collapse.  It was a self-correcting issue.  A currency collapse would stop imports (a weaker currency can naturally import fewer goods) and make exports cheap.A fine example is steel.  China imports huge amounts of iron ore (1.25 billion  metric tons) and coal. America has huge reserves of cheap iron ore and coal not to mention oil for making petrocoke.  We should be the more efficient steel producer.Finally, you’re supposed to export for money to buy imports, things you are not as efficient at producing or are incapable of producing.  You don’t export for the sake of exporting.

                        Germans don’t seem to be good at much without that sweet sweet cheap russian gas.  Why do you think BMW and other top German brands that used to be status symbols are driven by all kinds of dinggleberries today?  Because they need the volume.  Or Trader Joes and Aldis, both German companies.  Never set foot until after 08, wonder why that was?  Had to let them in to keep em docile.  Or Ford or GM giving up their car markets to the Japanese and Koreans, another sacrifice on the alter of Empire.  Or gambling being legalized in most states in 08 or right after, easy way to “raise” tax revenue without calling it a tax.  Everything and i mean everything can be directly tied back to 08.  That was the event horizon for all problems we now suffer from.

                        Trade should not be between countries. It should be between the owners of those goods and services. Putting the government in charge of trade will come out no better than putting them in charge of healthcare or education or energy or agriculture.
I get the comparative advantage thing. So where do you see America’s comparative advantage?

                                Thing is, self evidently, we do need more Walmarts. They wouldn’t keep springing up like noxious weeds if they were losing money. We have the market to sustain them. What needs to be addressed is the incentive structures that make that model successful.
As a side benefit of adjusting those incentives, you will also solve or at least ameliorate the “robber baron redux” that @Mr. House is talking about.

What right do we have to defend ourselves? We not only have the right, we have the duty.We are blessed with almost every kind of mineral, large amounts of sea coasts, multiple climatic zones, everything from polar to sub-tropical.  Despite some of the bad human capital, we also have large numbers of very high quality human capital. We have efficient capital markets.  For 50 years we put out the highest quality and lowest priced consumer goods in the world.  Made in America was a stamp of quality and low cost.It is not central planning or communism or something to protect our industries.  At one point, protectionism was called The American System.  We need far more than tariffs. We need major rollbacks of the administrative state to be competitive again.  But tariffs are a very good first step to stop the bleeding and protect what little industry we still have.

“At one point, protectionism was called The American System.“
Who called it that? The industrialists who profited from protectionism, right? But just like “safe and effective”, enough people bought into it that it became law of the land, and, by some bizarre coincidence, happened to turn those same industrialists into robber barons.

Yes, libertarianism is pure fantasy.  It imagines a world that does not and never will exist.  It entirely fails to take the human condition into consideration.

                                        Now you are just being silly. Stop it with the strawman arguments.
FWIW, there is nothing magical about the “national” part of national defense. We didn’t even have such a thing at the founding. We just all assume it is more efficient to pool all resources into the Federal State and, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, further assume they will use it wisely and efficiently.
Think of the military bases around the world. Is there really any reason to trust these same people with our defense?

        Back in the day, when I was still moderately essential and not yet obsolete..if I found myself between jobs I always took a hard look at the staff during the interview process. If I saw too many pakies, chinks, or prissy frightened furtive white men… I would politely finish up my interview and not return any follow up calls and would reject follow up interviews or offers. I wanted a job, not a nanny or baby sitter and I had no use for shitty women or queers. It’s worth money to not have to deal with arseholes on the job when things had to be gotten done.

            Somewhat recent experience with this, about 4 years ago. I went into an office, DC adjacent area for an interview and I was, quite literally, the only “man” on that floor of the building. A balding manlet was escorting me to the conference room. There were soyboys, manlets, problem glass wearing ‘guys’ galore, and then nothing but skirts and jeets.I immediately just laughed to myself, “I’m wasting my time”, I was polite but knew that not in 10,000 years were they going to hire me. The sole alpha male cutting a literal swatch through a sea of estrogen infused “men” and office Karens? Puh-leez! And as predicted, did NOT get that job. Shocker!(This little anecdote also speaks volumes about the quality of “men” orbiting the Capital Beltway and why I always felt like a stranger in a strange land there.)

                Modern Amerika is an alliance between women and the type of men you’ve described.  The ‘alpha’ men have been weeded-out carefully over the past 5 decades.
That is why Goddess Columbia’s burbs and District are full of these male-things, and why the nation is corrupt and failing.

        My dad never went to college but I remember when I was preparing to go and filing FAFSAs and such to get my gibs, he did a rundown on why this stuff was actually making college so expensive. Of course, he was correct, and showed far more insight than any politician I have seen expound on the topic since. Of course, college is a key cog of the left wing control of our society, maybe THE key cog, and the regime has a key interest in maintaining it, even if it means breaking the law to do so (Brandon’s debt relief).There are interesting infographics out there which show how costs have varied over time, and wouldn’t you know it, the stuff the government has intervened in the most (housing, healthcare, and education) have skyrocketed while the things the government has mostly stayed away from (things like technology) have plummeted to an insane degree. But after a while the managerial system is locked in and the nature of the bureaucracy means that things cannot change, and the only solution is to double down. You can’t get rid of FAFSAs, because millions of jobs directly and indirectly rely on the system, you can only open up the spigot more, even if that makes the problem worse.I wouldn’t mind paying a bit more for a computer if it meant I could buy a house or send a kid to college without saddling him with 20 years of debt.

            Yep. 100% true. Student loans and grants made collegelessaffordable. The government would lend some 18-year-old sucker with no collateral and no goals in life untold sums of money to study Sociology and Women’s Studies. The college would get paid up front, and a few years later when the kid was living in her parent’s basement and couldn’t afford to pay the loans on minimum wage plus tips as a barista, it was up to the government, not the college, to collect.Consequently, colleges kept raising tuition, and would be loath to ever turn a $tudent away. They’d keep stringing students along for five or six or more years with no degree as long as the tuition cash kept coming in. “College is for everyone” was a scam to keep the tuition money flowing — at a community college where I worked 20 years ago, 65% of the courses offered were non-credit remedial courses.Meanwhile they’d pay part-time and adjunct faculty two thousand bucks per course to lecture to these indebted kids (don’t ask me how I know, LOL) and the administrators and tenured faculty would make bank pocketing the difference.Most people have no idea how big of a fucking racket “higher education” really is.

                “…at a community college where I worked 20 years ago, 65% of the courses offered were non-credit remedial courses.”Bingo, yatzee…Yep, couple years ago my university—top 20 research institution—admitted to 40% of the Freshmen taking remedial course work.  When I first applied for college, there were no remedial courses.  You met admission standards or not.Problem is of course as you implied, there are waay too many students in college/university.  As I’ve noted, the average college attendee IQ is now estimated at 102-104.  Slightly better than average IQ for the nation, or perhaps that which we once had—three or four generations ago—for HS grads.What is needed is accountability of the nation’s university system.  Accountability in whom they admit and their employment prospects after graduation.  I believe this was done in the private government loan system in the 1980’s:“Congress amended the Higher Education Act to implement several key reforms:Default Rate Thresholds: Schools with high student loan default rates were cut off from federal aid, ensuring that institutions had a vested interest in their students financial and academic success.Recruitment Practices: The use of commission-based sales agents for recruiting students was prohibited, aiming to reduce aggressive and misleading enrollment tactics.Revenue Limits: For-profit colleges were restricted to receiving no more than 85% of their revenue from federal funding, encouraging diversification of funding sources and reducing overreliance on federal aid.What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  Of course, this simple and prudent oversight will drive the Lefties crazy, if for nothing else it will inevitable shrink the numbers of minorities falsely credentialed by our academic schools, now better known as “degree mills”.

                    Even the University of California system required you to  pass a dumbbell math and English test before you could take any further math or English courses back in my day (late 60s -70s). The test was pathetically easy but lots of kids flunked it even then. It must be worse now.

            When I got my MBA about 15 years ago, I had saved up to pay for it.  At the orientate was about 1,000 students in the cohort.  On Day 1 after the introductions this announcement was made, “For those of you enrolling in the program who haven’t figured out how to pay for it yet, please go through the double doors and our Stafford Loan officers will get you squared away.”The college was in charge of securing the loans.  I’ll never forget that.  Nor the stupidity of people pursuing an advanced degree completely based on loans because they “hadn’t figured out” yet how to pay for it.it was a long time ago, but the line through the double doors was long.  And they had to ask most to come back later.

        It’s fun to hear the lamentations of our enemies, but it’s a little early for champagne:1) our budget deficit is grotesque. DOGE will just put a 350 lb fatty on a small diet2) We have to grapple with the Triffin Paradox. Reforming the trade/monetary system is a generational project and must go way beyond reciprocal tariffs3) The Israel lobby still runs our foreign policy4) The immigration progress is nice but is a drop in the bucket5) All the fired government/NGO workers will be easily mobilized by the Left. The next election cycle will be utter chaos.I think much sterner measures will be required on all these points and we shall see if the Trump coalition has the stomach for them.

            5) All the fired government/NGO workers will be easily mobilized by the Left. The next election cycle will be utter chaos.They are comparatively few and without the slush fund possibly unable to be mobilized in any significant way. In fact, it would have been expected to have happened already but it seems the money drying up makes that difficult if not impossible on a national scale. The actual gangsters who matter apparently were far fewer than would be expected. One thing that really has stuck with me is how much return Soros got on his political investments. None of the money he spent was primarily based on philanthropy. Granted, his son seems to be an idiot and might piss away money for the feelz, but so far he has not.

                    Obviously people were aware of the graft; the GOP senators and congressmen may be falling into line on the nominations because of that. As far as I recall, that’s the first actual Q post I’ve read. Everything else was paraphrased. I don’t know what to make of Q, which I had disregarded as nuttery, but it was something more.

            3) The Israel lobby still runs our foreign policy
This is an error introduced by the antisemites, who imagine Jews as an all-knowing, all-seeing omnipotent hive mind. The Israel lobby runs Israel policy and they do not have a free hand. They also have to deal with the actual Israelis who have other ideas.

                Agreed about the “omnipotent/hive mind” issue. I’m clearly one of the more philo-Semitic people active on this site. That said, I think actual Israelis and AIPAC want us to solve their Iran problem for them. Meanwhile, they (both AIPAC and actual Israelis) have screwed up big time over the past 25 years and have dragged us along with them. That’s just a fact and I tell my Jewish friends the same thing. The smarter ones get it and the more naive ones think 80 million Iranians will magically disappear.

                The lobby is so powerful that it could induce Trump to propose his ridiculous and illegal “throw the Palestinians out of Gaza” policy. Removing the Palestinians from Palestine has been a wet dream of the Israelis for 75 years but we have always pretended we were against that. Apparently, those days are past. How such a policy benefits the USA I know not. BTW – the proper use of the term anti-Semite is to describe someone who has a racial objection to Jews (e.g., 𝘋𝘦𝘳 𝘍ü𝘩𝘳𝘦𝘳). Those who object to Jewish behavior or religion are a different breed. Jews are always trying to conflate the two.

            “All the fired government/NGO workers will be easily mobilized by the Left.”By whom? One of the first things we learned from all this is that “the Left” is a largely fake construction of the federal government. The reason why “the Left” was mobilized in 2017-2020 was because we underwent a color revolution, by the exact same people who engineer color revolutions around the globe. The whole point of taking out USAID and NED and all them immediately was to deprive them of the energy to do it to us again.I also wonder just how many government employees are lefty true believers and who are in it for the paycheck. You know, being part of #TheResistance in 2017 was very easy. You could work in the bowels of some office building in DC and be surrounded by #TheResistance, including your boss, who probably told you that everyone is doing it. Now, a lot of people got fired and Trump’s people are sniffing around. A lot of people took buyouts just so they didn’t have to see Trump’s mug every day. The energy just isn’t there. Are people getting laid off today still goijng to have the energy to go fight Orange Man Bad in two years, or are they going to move on with their lives? I suspect for the most part, the latter.

        The irony of Federal “help” for education is that the endless availability of Federally guaranteed student loans has allowed Universities to hire thousands of useless, often DEI, administrators and offer innumerable courses in utterly useless subjects, while raising tuitions by a factor of 10-20 times…All of which has massively harmed students and their families, while enriching the top faculty at places like Harvard…Eliminating all Federal aid and interference in education would be the best thing Trump could ever do to fix this mess….

            Higher education, as well as certain other “industries” such as regulatory compliance, civil rights (fear of discrimination lawsuits) has allowed the US to do something like what the Soviets achieved in producing a near-zero unemployment rate. The problem is the same as the one the USSR had though – a lot of the “jobs” are pure bullshit and when they are eliminated, a tsunami of unemployment such as has not been seen since the Great Depression will flood the land.There are tons of small college towns that will become ghost towns when the college disappears just as used to happen in mill towns when the mill went overseas. In fact, the US overall is so far from any kind of sensible or sane configuration today that it’s hard to see how fixing the myriad crises will not cause immense pain. Similar attempts to right the wrongs (both moral and economic) of Communism in the USSR were more than the society could take and led to dissolution. I suspect this will ultimately be the result here.

        I know everyone here has enjoyed the tears and lamentations the last couple weeks, but despite knowing how unhinged our enemies are, they still continue to surprise me somehow. It came to my attention through hosting with AirBnB that their CEO (or former, don’t know) was being brought onto the DOGE team. Hosts, mainly women, are losing their freaking minds. Which I know is not surprising, but the weird part I noticed is that it is mainly from women from Europe and non-US countries. One complained about how bad she felt for all those fired government workers. It boggles the mind to imagine being a Brit, or any non-US citizen- and giving any sort of damn about US gov employees. These are the level of people we deal with. Their emotions are so volatile that they flit from one obsession to the next, sure that they are on the side of angels. Democracy was a terrible idea.

        Enforced protectionism due to sanctions has worked out well for Russia because it is still super-majority White Russian, where Moslems from the former Soviet Union serve the same purpose America’s Blacks did in the 19th century. Soviet achievements in science and technology were actually quite impressive, although hampered by an unworkable economic system. Similarly, China’s recent decades of rapid growth are not a testament to communism (quite the opposite), but to the stability which enabled the Chinese to realize their economic potential. In the U.S., our population going forward will be not too dissimilar from that of Latin America, whose colonial rulers also got their labor supply from wherever was convenient. Therefore, even the best industrial policy is unlikely to bring a return to the economy of the 19th century our leaders might imagine. We’d be better-advised to look to Brazil, not Russia or China, as our peer competitors.

                Reality isn’t very important.Immigration is economically ruinous to almost everybody, yet everyone we think of as wearing green-eyeshade-colored glasses (business, economists, libertarians, etc.) demands it—more, forever. That decision is made. Reasons are invented or ignored ad hoc.A company that replaces its American nerds with Indians obliterates its productivity, reputation, and future. You can point to it on the graph. The “bros” might nod. They’re still doing it, not least to punish you for thinking you’re allowed to object to it. See Elon’s Christmas drug binge.“AI” (the several things that are called that) is normal calculation, as seen on ENIAC, donemore. Babbage and Turing wouldn’t be surprised by any of it (they were smart). What’s different is the “bros” have insane fantasies about it—to feed insane fantasies about themselves.A wrench is stronger than a hand. That doesn’t make the CEO of Snap-On a god. He absolutely thinks he is, compared to you—look at his house—but that’s not amplified by aworld cult of wrench, wherewrench-nessis an apocalyptic demonic force thatonly He can wield!,so it doesn’t really matter that he’s an asshole.The “tech” reality distortion field is self-oscillating. Trump has been chumped—or shot—into feeding it more power. Just like we’re to being replaced by workers who can’t do our jobs, we’re to be ruled, enslaved, imprisoned, etc., by “AI” thatdoesn’t work.It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t.

            This is good.  While still too subdued [for me, IMO], it is a surprising amount of directness from a sitting president of a country, and he said this at the WEF of all places.
The most amazing thing is that globohomo has invited him back for their most recent event, and his speech this year is even better, a lot better actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATNbGD37Dz0
He even brought up and directly criticized the current globohomo practice of transplanting enormous “migrant” hordes.  This part astonished me.  Perhaps, just maybe, there is some real hope.

        “If you were to revitalize IBM, you would strip out the good stuff into a new company and hand it to smart people and leave the old stuff to the investors.”It’s been a long time since I’ve dealt with IBM, but those days were of the first assault of the old IBM as king of the hill.  We were one of two major universities to have no significant IBM equipment on campus.  This of course meant we were a prime target of IBM sales.What I immediately noticed was that IBM in those days did not market to the user per se, but to the management.  The user, academic user, was pretty much anti-IBM and more super computer inclined ala Cray Research.  This did not deter IBM, they were simultaneously talking at the level of the Executive VP of the university.  Of course, they were successful in selling one of their large main frames to the university despite the overwhelming objection of faculty in the College of Science.The second arm of the IBM strategy was to find at the local level (weak) managers and directors in the computing support structure of the university.  I was in a meeting of such and had privy to IBM’s sales pitch.it went something like this…”This university installation is too important to fail.  We are now partners and we will not allow this roll out to fail.  You will have the complete support of IBM….”  What they literally did was requisite an office(s) in the computing center and sent a staff to occupy and run every step of the preparation for installation and rollout and systems support for this new multimillion dollar mainframe.This IBM staff took over for the weak management.  They quickly found out the power structure—especially the check signer—and relieved him of all responsibility, except to sign off on the expenses.  To fail to sign off, was of course tantamount to failure since IBM would leave the mess in his hands.  IBM even sent their people around to set (required) meetings of university staff.  That’s how I got involved, they mistook university academics as in some way being subject to university administration. I was initially taken back when they asked to set my calendar.  In the end, they even found a couple of IBM support staff to be hired on for continuing mainframe software support—another legacy IBM left as these system support people became the highest paid systems people at the university far surpassing even their management.   😉

        “If you create grants for buying BMW’s, then BMW raises its prices by the amount of the grant.”
Yes, indeed.  In most cases it is quite obvious.  Case in point, EV vehicles.  In 2024 the $7k rebate was lifted for most EV’s.  The market took a hit.  For example, I bought mine with $6k off of the MSRP sticker.  No haggling, simply a sign on the sticker price on the window of the EV.  GM advertised their EV’s with a “special” GM discount of $7k!  Saw this myself.

        Re: Russia. Rubio met with the Russians this past week. He identified three basic goals1.normalizing relationships such as reopening embassies in each others countries. 2. ending the Ukraine war (note that Europe and Zelensky are being completely ignored). 3. geopolitical partnership with Russia on matters of shared interests – the Russians nodded vigorously during the translationRussia is worried about China. But the US decided to informally declare war on Russia which ended (for a time) our ability to work together.Russia and the US basically control the world’s energy supplies/reserves. There’s no natural reason for us to be enemies. We dislike the Europeans as much as they do, for example. And we’re both worried about Chinese expansionist goals in East Asia.The hurdle Trump faces, and he has 3 years, 11 months to get over it, is permanently and legislatively cementing the changes he is making. Otherwise, we get a blizzard of EO’s from the next Democrat puppet undoing what Trump did. He needs Congress to be just as aggressive in rewriting the rules and that will be very hard to do.But do it we must, or we’ll reset to December 2024 within a few years of Trump retiring.It is great to see him rewiring the economy. My question to all of you is:“What careers should we be encouraging our kids to take up? And all those displaced govt employees will need jobs. What fields should they pursue once freed from the yoke of government enslavement?”

                Nice straw man!  I especially liked how you inserted the word “friends” which I never wrote nor implied.  We have areas of mutual strategic interest including energy production and China.And Russia has been invaded twice by two of Europe’s most celebrated megalomaniacs losing tens of millions of its citizens in the process.Yes, the US has been meddling in their affairs, just as they meddle in ours.  But there are a lot of areas in which we can work with them.  Russia probably wouldn’t mind ending the Middle East conflicts simply by bringing Iran to the negotiating table while the US forces Israel to to the same.You’re just as bad as the “left” throwing racial epithets around with no basis for doing so.

        At some point Trump will [have to?] deal with Congress.  He obviously is not going to use them to get the majority of what he wants done done.  But he can bring them in strategically to hold or consolidate the gains he’s made.
Given that it will require a lot of time and political capital to get the worthless seat-warmers do to anything useful for the country, he will have to choose what he wants them to do with great wisdom.

        The analogy of the USA to IBM is great.  They owned “tech” through the ‘60’s &amp; ‘70’s.  Then Apple went public in 1980, followed by Microsoft et al and they quickly fell by the wayside – never got the mojo back.  Didn’t hire a visionary to turn the prospects around.  Trump seems to be the visionary this country needs to pull its head out of its ass.

                If we had any excess wealth to be put in a sovereign wealth fund, it would be mismanaged and squandered and used to do evil.  Just imagine what a sovereign wealth fund would have been used for under a Biden administration. We would have used the fund to “defund” oil and gas and instead “invested” it in solar and wind boondoggles.   Every university across the country would have a big influx of fund money.But the US cannot even fund itself from taxes.  The average American (this might even be household) has under 1000 Dollars in the bank and tens of thousands of Dollars in debt, not including his share of the national debt.  The American government is 35 trillion in the hole.  I’m pretty sure every municipality and state in the US is insolvent or very close to it.  We run like a trillion Dollars in net trade deficit every single year.  We have been running budget deficits every single year since the early 1960s.We have trillions in wealth, but it’s untapped and likely to remain untapped for the foreseeable future.  Who thinks all these new lithium discoveries in the US are going to mined any time soon?  Maybe not even in most of our lifetimes.  Most other countries can operate an underground mine for less money than it would cost for us to have people just pick up minerals just laying on the ground.

                    The “Bidens” of the world will rob us to pay for their favored projects and reward their allies whether we have a sovereign wealth fund or not. That’s no reason not to have one. Kind of like the digital panopticon; it’s coming, whether we like it or not. The question is who runs it and for what purpose.

            What are you talking about? There’s scads of wealth. All the buildings, all the real estate, all the people are sources of future government revenue. So long as you believe in a sovereign state with taxing “authority”, the wealth at their fingertips is staggering.

                Almost all of the existing RE in the US already has a claim on it.  Plus, it’s private property in most cases.  The idea that we could just monetize private property and undeveloped land doesn’t seem right to me. But, admittedly, I could be wrong.  If  we monetize public land today and put the money in a sovereign wealth fund, what happens in the future should the state/feds want to sell or lease the land in the future?  Is this not double accounting?Taxing resources is something we generally already do.  For example, people who own an oil well get bills from the state and the feds based on how much oil they produced.  Same is true of coal mines, gas fields, probably copper,  bauxite, iron ore and even trees as well.  While a country like Norway puts the money in a sovereign wealth fund, we piss ours away on wars and tranny surgeries.

                    I already said taxation is theft. You don’t have to sell me on it.
Happens all the time. The gov of Illinois a few years back sold rights to collect tolls (on federal highways!!!) to some overseas firm in exchange for a big windfall so he could prove the state wasn’t failing. W tried the same thing, offering more highway funds for state or locality who sold rights to the roads to foreign entities.
The cash is there. It just takes enough scummy, immoral jerks in places of power to make it happen.

            Perhaps in the same way the Fed “monetizes” debt, that is, click-o-the-keystrokes?Reclassify those digitals digits as column B instead of column A?DOGE has discovered a number of budget entries that could be reclassified as a very healthy SWF in the trillions.Martin Armstrong proposed reclassifying the debt entirely and thus getting rid of it (and not paying the b*stards for ‘printing’ our own money.)It used to be you couldn’t use a Treasury bond as collateral; now, you can use just about any debt instrument.  Armstrong says reclassify all the public debt as equity coupons, as in coupon bonds. Let the Treasury declare those coupons can be used to buy equity, that is, stocks or commercial paper (corporate bonds), and we’d all be invested in our country instead of in debt to a handful of foreign families.  All that unlocked investment would be a boom like things should’ve been, and we get the returns.  I imagine the same would hold true for a sovereign wealth fund.He says we don’t need taxes, never really did.  Taxes were invented for purposes of seignorage in the time of metal coins.  Taxes were a way for the king and his treasurer to get some of his coins back, so he could spend them into the local economy again on another project.

Even if that means Bytedance only gets 50% of the sale price with the other 50% going to uncle sam, well they ain’t going to sell it for anything less that gives them their true value.

                    Bytedance would get paid full ‘fair market value’.
A strategic buyer like Amazon or Meta along with maybe some private equity firms would pay that price but give 50% of the equity to the US government. So yes, the USG would get the shares for ‘free’ in this scenario.

        I worked at Microsoft for a little more than a decade, beginning in the mid-90’s, and I saw firsthand how its fantastic success attracted parasites both in government and within the company, who all wanted a piece of its enormous profits.A state legislator sometime around 2000, for example, bemoaned the fact that they’d missed the opportunity to tax the stock options Microsoft was using as rewards and incentives for employees at all levels (not just upper management).But the real sign of trouble was the growth of the Legal and HR departments, in both cases a response to lawsuits coming from the government or from disgruntled employees looking to cash in.This, along with Steve Ballmer’s shift of the company’s direction from personal computing to the enterprise market previously dominated by IBM, changed the culture within a few short years.When I joined in 1994, while it was already the infamously cutthroat competitor its opponents said it was, it was also a fairly nimble organization where the software engineers were the elite. It was an exciting place to work.Five years later, sales and marketing, along with Legal and HR, ruled the roost. The peons weren’t getting so many stock options and annual performance reviews came with a Jack Welch style directive to purge the bottom X percent. It had become just like the government contractors I had worked for before joining Microsoft, bloated and lethargic with bureaucratic red tape — and girl bosses everywhere. Eventually I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I left.It was a victim of its own success.Long story short: I’ve seen the kind of people who make up the Blob and I have personal reasons to despise them.

            Does he also have record low numbers of illegal entries? I get that more deportations are necessary, but perhaps there are also fewer illegal crossings and more “self-deports.” If prior admin had 1 M deports, but 5 M crossings (net 4 M in), I would prefer 500k deports and 1 M crossings (net 500k in – sure, net 0, or even negative is the goal).
Honestly don’t know, not even sure how or if it can be measured accurately.

                There are tens of millions of illegals in the US.
The number of deportations is…the number of people deported who should not  be in the US.They were giving out numbers daily, now it’s weekly, and I suspect soon it will be monthly.
Obama was tougher on illegals than Trump.
