        You seem to think that Rolling Stone is in the truth business. Is not, never has been. They’re in the ‘sensational’ business. They only talk about sensational things. If it’s not sensational when they start, it will be by the time they’re finished.They’ve managed from time to time to get items with factual content across inadvertently, but truth really never entered into it all.

        Like Rush said, this were not journalistic errors because this is NOT journalism.As a long arm of liberalism they do what they are supposed to, tilt at windmills!Was Pravda in error when it praised the Communist Party? Of course not.In this context i highly recommend a lecture on “Crusaderism” by Aaron Clarey:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD2ofP62KLU&amp;list=PLDEC323DD295CF340Aaron orCaptain Capitalism, who just posted a of picture of a “social justice career fair” sign seen at some college, it’s hilarious.&amp; Off topic for Mr. Grey Enlightenment, how comes you don’t have comments enabled on your site, considering you are a heavy commenter around the blogosphere yourself?No goddamn common courtesy to offer a comment reach-around!

        Leon is right. You find one false story, there’s more to come. As Al Gore once said, a leopard doesn’t change its stripes.
