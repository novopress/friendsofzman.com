        We just got out of a four year period where the president was a braindead, dying vegetable. We don‚Äôt actually know who was running the country and who made the decisions both big and small. I don‚Äôt even need to go over all the disasters this managerial cabal got us into over that four year period. Of course they are going to get away with it because the managerial system is unaccountable by design, but the system has also lost its legitimacy. Once Trump got to work, the media tried to portray the federal government like they were in an episode ofThe West Wing‚Ä¶and nobody bought it. The federal workers were whining on Reddit that nobody liked them. If anything, people are mad that Trump hasn‚Äôt done enough. People might have bought the idea of liberals talking about the rule of law and accountability five years ago, but they don‚Äôt anymore. These idiots sound ridiculous on the dais.Of course this doesn‚Äôt mean the system is dead. It can shamble on for a long time. But it can only do so by pivoting to total unaccountable tyranny, which isprobablythe next step when and if they get back into power.

            Excellent post. Legitimacy is a funny thing. If we didn‚Äôt suffer a 30% increase in the general price index (for most consumers/families) since COVID, do you think the System would be under this level of attack? I don‚Äôt. The System has to deliver results to be legitimate. People can put up with all kinds of crookery if they can pay their bills.

                People can put up with all kinds of crookery if they can pay their bills.Related to people will wink üòâ at a little governmental ‚Äúpalm greasing‚Äù üíµ if it results in Things Getting Done: Roads built, maintained, and plowed clear in the winter, garbage picked up, parks built, new schools / hospitals / housing built, etc.It‚Äôs when 1) palms are greased yet NOTHING is done or 2) no palms are greased but True Believers feel Getting Things Done isbeneaththem and instead we will Change The World that legitimacy is lost.

                    Once patching potholes moves from the optional to the impossible, and we are well into that phase, loss of legitimacy becomes fatal in the long run. ‚ÄúShovel-ready jobs‚Äù was good rhetoric back then but now describes something no one can do any longer.

                        The roads where I live ‚Äì in a reasonably prosperous metro area of NYS ‚Äì have fallen into disrepair as I have never seen before in my 64 years. Major commercial roads in this county are so badly patched and pot-holed that at times it seems like I‚Äôm reliving my time decades ago driving in Thailand.

                    Trying to think back to something the System produced that could be called a ‚Äúresult‚Äù ‚Äì meaning a useful one. The interstate highways? Cool, but here in NYS we still pay tolls despite the original agreement of 1957, that the tolls would expire in 1997. Oops! Our ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù governor, George Pataki, plucked our heartstrings by explaining that it would be oh so cruel to toss all those tollbooth attendants out of work. Seriously; that was the argument. So the tolls continued‚Ä¶ and here we are, in 2025, still paying our tolls for use of I-90. With this difference: the tollbooths are all gone, replaced by an overhead surveillance system that bills you automatically. Who knows how much that cost.What else? National parks are nice. The coin collection at the Smithsonian is nice. Sorry, that‚Äôs all I can come up with.

            the system has also lost its legitimacy
Great comment.
ÔªøMany things both good and bad will die with the Boomers. Faith in the system looms large among those deaths. Covid was our Chernobyl, and the Afghan withdrawal seemed mighty familiar. Rule by force is the only option open to them but it always has an expiry date, usually when the next thug rises to power.

                The problem the Demoncrats will have if they ever get back into power is that, unlike the Left that took power in many places decades ago, they are uniquely feminized and soft. Castro and others like him were at least real men who didn‚Äôt flinch at doing the nasty work of being dictators. The wimmin and queers who are now the core of the Left have no idea how to be ‚Äúthe first thug‚Äù and will inevitably crumple when the ‚Äúnext thug‚Äù arises. That next thug will probably be someone from the Right who has massive popular support from opposing the crazy stuff the Left tries to impose on us once they get back in power. This is why I think that whatever xirlboss or poofter the Dems manage to foist on us in ‚Äô28 or ‚Äô32 will be very likely to be the last President.The most likely revolutionary leader will be someone with a military background who perhaps was thrown out of the service for refusing the Vax. It will be easy for him to build his base of support because the Dems will feel that they have to out-crazy the Biden Politburo. They‚Äôll be doing things that directly impoverish and harm large parts of the American people. The model will be things like this new bill being pushed in Oregon that basically puts a government commissar in charge of hiring and firing on every farm and ranch in the state. I need to go now so perhaps I‚Äôll look it up and post it in the thread later. It won‚Äôt be difficult for this putative new Franco to raise a massive popular army.

                                Most of the Eastern part of the state is already part of a movement to join Idaho. There‚Äôs also an egregious gun bill Salem is trying to force on us called Measure 114 and now with this thing (which is HB2548) that movement will gain even more strength.

                    Everything the feminized, negrified Left does is enforced by ripped white male cops with shaven heads and tats who are willing to shoot or incarcerate their fellow whites for a paycheck, a dental plan and a 20-and-out pension.
As long as they keep getting paid these mercenaries will take orders from anyone.

                        This is true.  It is white men with crew cuts, mortgages, looming pensions, and often college-bound daughters that enforce the tyranny of women upon American men.  It‚Äôs hard to buck that jones in a wealthy empire.Execs of corporations, leaders of government. . . same thing.  They enforced the Woke-Fem State, and got bounced if they didn‚Äôt.I don‚Äôt want to be the enemy of them, or of cops in general.  But they made me their enemy by persecuting me and mine in the name of their own advancement and profit.  Made me a criminal, they were so intent upon their fattish ways.You are either on my side or you are not.

            Everything Trump has done to Columbia and Harvard universities will be done to Christian schools the moment a Democrat is president again and appoints a new Attorney General. Anyone at a Christian school in the US that is not a Jewish school in mufti should be preparing for departure in either 2029 or 2033 from that school. Theology departments will be decimated. I have pointed this out to several people and their reaction (curiously dormant from 2021-2025) is to say, ‚Äújust let ‚Äôem try.‚ÄùThat few are talking about this or expecting it is par for the course in Current Year. I don‚Äôt believe that 99% of the population is thinking more than 24 hours in advance, save for their bank accounts.

                Christian schools?WhatChristian schools? Places like Notre Dame, Baylor and Fordham are no more Christian than are mainline Catholicism, Methodism and Lutheranism. Christianity is merely a figleaf for the whole panoply of depraved malefeasance that is the true bedrock of clerical belief nowadays.

                    So you‚Äôll stand by and do nothing, just like conservatives have done for the past 50 years. If they‚Äôre not Christian any longer, how did that happen?Imagine being an American. One, you let your Christian institutions be skinsuited and turned into Soviet academies, all the while chuckling to yourself about the student loans the commissars were incurring. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll never get a job,‚Äù you all said. ‚ÄúHave fun flipping burgers.‚ÄùAnd two, now that you admit that (at least to you) these schools are no longer Christian, you pretend not to care what happens to them. You and the American Right,never did‚Äî you expected them to fail and leave the political field to you ‚Äî and you will gladly continue your Trail of Errors to the grave.

                        I was arguing for perserving the integrity of academia and the foundational mission of Christian universities decades ago, so do not lump me with the conservative fools who ignored their plight. Regardless, what‚Äôs done is done. The goose is cooked. It‚Äôs a bit late in the game to defend Christianity in academia. That process should have been well underway 50 years ago.

                    Steubenville University in Ohio, for one. Moreover, real scholarship is still being conducted at many smaller Catholic schools. As this site is a hot-bed of anti-Catholism and Jack Chick-ism, I wouldn‚Äôt expect a group of 60+ Boomers who haven‚Äôt picked up a book in 40 years to be familiar with anything occurring in the theological world, for example, or the world of knowledge in general. You just want to smash and break things you don‚Äôt like. A very Semitic impulse.

                They would do that anyway, without provocation. We‚Äôre already well past the point where both sides of the political spectrum want their opponents locked up and the key thrown away. This hasn‚Äôt progressed farther than it already has only because the managerial state is resisting it out of self preservation. Civic nationalism is not returning in my lifetime.

My problem is the mindset‚Äìironically a very conservative mindset‚Äìyou seemed to evince, maybe a misinterpretation on my part, that a pretext was required for leftist outrages. Trump won‚Äôt go far enough, true, but Cloward-Piven is the smart move. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll help them back on their feet but only because they won‚Äôt let him.

                            I sincerely doubt Trump is capable of purging Harving and returning it to sanity. However, if he did, it would send a thunderbolt throughout academia. If mighty Harvard was brought low, how could little ol‚Äô Wake Forest, Mississippi State, and Idaho resist the great orange deluge? The destruction‚Äìrestoration, actually‚Äìof Harvard might actually compel self-reform thoughout academia in favor of having reform imposed upon it.
Again, I think Trump‚Äôs effort is quixotic, but his heart is certainly in the right place.

                                It‚Äôs possible, though unlikely.  Academics and bureaucrats are nothing if not conformists.  They will do what they are told and are expected to do.  Those who won‚Äôt conform would find themselves driven out by the same forces that force out right-thinkers today.
They don‚Äôt have strongly held beliefs in any event.  They have fashionable beliefs.  When the fashions change, out with the old and in with the new.
We see this all the time already.  One day nobody thought about trannies, but then suddenly it became fashionable and now we are surrounded by lunatics droning on about trannies.

                Blinken strikes me as a rather dumb person who would rather be playing guitar. Was he setting policy? Maybe. I doubt it. The people in the actual inner circle setting policy are likely those we never heard of. The difference between say Trump (nobody can seriously think Trump‚Äôs people were in charge of State during his term) and Brandon was that the managers agreed with Brandon. Blinken is more of a reflection of that agreement than a sign he was running policy.This might sound like nitpicking, or maybe deflecting blame, but it‚Äôs really not. I think this gets to the core of the managerial system.

        ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs return to power cannot be understood without noticing how the nation‚Äôs richest men lined up behind him.‚ÄùThe rich Jews lined up behind him when they realized that they no longer controlled the monkeys in the left-wing circus.What happened to Claudine Gay at Harvard and Liz Magill at Penn is a lot more important than people realize. The rich Jews like Bill Ackman finally realized that the brown immigrants saw the Jews as ‚Äúwhite colonizers‚Äù rather than fellow ‚Äúvictims.‚Äù They got on the Trump train because they understood that Harris was more likely to side with the brown people but MAGA was certain to be pro-Zionist.It‚Äôs noteworthy that of the three college presidents harangued by Stefanik‚Äôs committee, only the Jewish one at MIT kept her job. And Gay was replaced by a Jew at Harvard.

            All good points. An announcement that known anti-Semites were among the wave of ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù who streamed across the border might even lead to actual mass deportations.

                    Absolutely true. As an example that didn‚Äôt get much attention, Netanyahu shut up after a point about sending the Gazans to Europe or North America. You see, the people Israel consider the most dangerous animals in the world should be welcomed by your country unless it has a Jewish population. If that‚Äôs the case, the savages cannot be put there, either. As we have seen, the opinion about the Tribe is widely shared among ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù and hence the disappearance of ‚ÄúREFUGEES WELCOME‚Äù signs held up by pretty goy sluts.

                        No near term hope, that‚Äôs a fact. Unfortunately, for mass deportations to happen, not only would jews have to get onside (which is in process), but we‚Äôd have to appear to embrace them as fellow whites (which the zio-evangelical trumpists do a nice job of). Then, if all that were to happen, further on up the road we could have a chance to rid ourselves of other problems.

                            The Jews who are white have always been ‚Äúembraced as white.‚Äù The effort to section them off as a separate minority (favor them, in American terms) was, until a few recent psyops worked‚Äî‚Äùzio-evangelical trumpis[m]‚Äù among them‚Äîalmost entirely Jewish. Earlier exclusions were based on their not being of some specific white nationality (German most famously; arrivals at Ellis Island were not American; etc.) or not Christian.When Whoopi Goldberg said she didn‚Äôt care about the Holocaust because that was a fight between white people, that‚Äôs theonly timeshe ever got in trouble. It‚Äôs the only heresy. (Whitenessdidthe Holocaust, official history says.)The intra-left conflict over ‚ÄúGaza‚Äù isbecauseJews are white‚Äîthe Jews in America and on TV, that is. Israel is largely and increasingly non-white (and acts like it) but that‚Äôs not visible. To the Jewish-trained minority-American golem, Israel is a colonial outpost of the white professional-managerial and ‚Äúownership‚Äù class, the one it‚Äôs their duty (moral and official) to displace.American blacks have always been readily convertible to antisemitism because Jews are the white people who cause all their problems (as they understand things). They just never heard of Jews. When they do, a lightbulb comes on (dimly). ‚ÄúGaza‚Äù threatened to put that lightbulb over the head of the whole anti-white minority coalition.‚ÄúThose aren‚Äôt white people, they‚Äôre Jews‚Äù is implausible. Everyone who can fall for that already has. So, something else. Rather than ‚Äúput the woke away‚Äù the Jews are greatly intensifying their anti-whiteness‚Äîwhile seekinglegalseparation, no longer as a non-white group (making them part of ‚ÄúMENA‚Äù has been set aside, pragmatically) but as the only white people no one is allowed to hate or hurt, the caste of kings among them. Laws precede common sense and become it.What other white people think, what they ‚Äúembrace‚Äù or deny or whatever, enters nowhere into it. They don‚Äôt decide anything.

                    There is a reason why Trump is wasting his political capital by going after Harvard and Columbia for ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù as opposed to doing the mass deportations he ran on. It‚Äôs because Jews are worried that the future elite of the USA will not be on board with their agenda. What Jews do not seem to be worried about is if places like Charleroi PA and Springfield OH are transformed because of mass importation. Heck, according to Chris Rufo in City-Journal, Jewish organizations funded this.

                        I don‚Äôt know about Trump himself, but the claims of anti-Semitism provide some within the Administration a pretext to engage in Cloward-Piven. That is to be celebrated, although as you state it is places such as Springfield, Ohio, that need immediate attention.

                        On good authority this is exactly what they are worried about. Making an alliance with Asians to divide and conquer Whitey sounded good 25 years ago. They are now realizing that Vivek has no compunction about doing what is best for him, even if he did acquiesce in the short term.They created a lot of gollums. The most immediate threat is the rival elite from places with huge economies and populations and zero history of open ness.They are scrambling behind the scenes trying to figure out what to do about it. And yes, they give zero cares about the population of Charleroi. That is they care that the Whites are replaced but care not how or by whom. Yet, that gollum is coming back.Another gollum that will be surfacing are identitarian Whites. It is inevitable and it is happening and the youth are well are on their way. Sewing chaos to upend a society and assume control may work to get control, but to consolidate power it has not been a success as we see from the 20th century. Eventually the subverted and the gollums used as the sledge hammer figure out what is happening.We are headed there next and surveillance and repression isn‚Äôt going to put a lid on it. There are too many people in the out-group for it to work. Somehow, the highest IQ people on the planet failed to think that through from every angle.

I believe this.  I was grumping to some friends over breakfast at the local diner Sunday past, about the fact that normal, productive people have no representation.  The sweet,  late middle-aged waitress, of blue-colar mid-Michigan stock, overheard and went full 1488.  As in, mustache man was the last leader to do anything good for normal citizens.   I was both amused and somewhat gobsmacked.  Suddenly the scrambled eggs tasted even better.

                                White identity is inevitable and rising quickly. I believe that White identity politics will bring the system down. It is built entirely upon Whites acqiescing by being, color-blind or cowed or silent.Existence cannot countenance that and that is the most powerful instinct. Once we become more organized and vocal, the system will be unable to deal with it. It will go into full hysterics that makes TDS seem like a moment of Zen.Glad to hear about the diner. I am not a big painter guy thing. I think we draw on a longer heritage and channel Alfred, Don Pelayo and other figures whose task and predicament compares to ours.Good information.

                            I wish what you say is true, but I don‚Äôt have a lot of confidence. Whitey has been brainwashed and his too passive to do anything about his plight. The fact that more and more of us are speaking out is helpful, but is it too little too late? We are well on our way to becoming Brazil and polite society is okay with that.

                                Polite Society is so dumb in terms of thinking about anything other than striving and maximizing money they probably aren‚Äôt really aware of Brazil much less its demographics.That said, there are 185 million of us. If we were a few million split in half that would be one thing. I think the sheer numbers means a large number of whites are going to get nasty face rubs in diversity. No where left to run. The pogrom is in the striver class and those are under ever more pressure from AI.Our side of the divide seems very far away in terms of solutions. Still, I think the sheer numbers and the fact that The Regime is simply not addressing the problem much less naming it creates massive buildups of pressure. Moreover, blacks are really off the deep end. They smelled blood and are not going to back down. Creating more pressure.Even if 20 million Whites become explicit and we get even a few overt White identitarians in safe districts the system can‚Äôt withstand that pressure. People are beyond fed up now. The Regime has to address it directly but it won‚Äôt.

                It‚Äôs even more hilarious than that. During the Gay struggle session, Bill Ackman made a long post on X about how he just realized that Harvard‚Äôs DEI programs are out of control and anti-White. So Gay was fired and replaced by a Jew who was‚Ä¶ on Harvard‚Äôs DEI committee! Huh, turns out Bill Ackman didn‚Äôt actually care about anti-White DEI at Harvard after all, who would have guessed? And of course Trump is going to war against Harvard but‚Ä¶ is not mentioning anti-White DEI at Harvard either. What is he talking about? Antisemitism!Gay‚Äôs $800k salary reminds me of that old saying about hookers. They‚Äôre paying her to be quiet.

Turns out they ain‚Äôt very thirsty.‚ÄòIn the end, the thirty or so years of bizarre social politics that have proliferated among the elites may be ending due to the consolidation of the oligarchy‚ÄôMusk and Trump aren‚Äôt the only elites.The elites ‚Äî principally the Rockefellers ‚Äî have been backing feminism and its religion of woke for at least 70 years.  Abigail Rockefeller was a member of Cell 16 in the 1970s.  You do not understand, and you underestimate, your enemy.  These ‚Äòbizarre social politics‚Äô have been going on far longer than 30 years.This idea that the American Religion of woke/feminism somehow is on the run and fleeing for hideyholes is incorrect.  DEI and Woke have barely been touched, are firmly ensconced in Western institutions, are taught K-Doctorate, are still backed by elites, and have yet to face any credible threat.When Donald Trump holds a rally and rails against female empowerment and organizational feminism, let me know.  Then the real fight finally begins.

            Hate to say it, but I agree wholeheartedly. So-called ‚Äúwoke‚Äù is absolutely nothing new under the sun. It‚Äôs warmed over countercultural radicalism that has been plaguing us for 60 years. And its embedded so profoundly that it will take decades of sustained assault to dislodge it. Frankly, I think that‚Äôs borderline impossible.

            Have a look at opinion polls grouped by age on attitudes toward Israel. The young have negative views, the old geezers and Boomers have positive views. The politics of this will change eventually, we just may not live to see it. There are 80 million Iranians. They are still butt-hurt with us over the Shah and 1956 etc. Imagine how pissed they will be for generations if Israel attacks them without negotiating. Change is inevitable.

            This is a very good point and highlights the contradiction within the ruling elites‚Äô plans of population replacement ‚Äî and what will ultimately lead to their downfall. They seek a dumber, more compliant domestic population in order to protect themselves from revolution and retribution while simultaneously maintaining a military capable of defending the empire‚Äôs riches and threatening rivals abroad.That‚Äôs definitionally impossible to pull off. A divided, demoralized populace that is incapable of fighting domestically is absolutely incapable of fighting abroad.You would think that these people would have a level of self-awareness to realize this, but they have a 2,000+ year reputation that suggests otherwise.

I don‚Äôt take drugs so I got my wife to wear a pillow under her dress and I held a fake gun to her stomach and demanded her money. Brought a tear to our eyes

        The oligarchs are deep true believers in their religion; all of them. They are also children who have huge sums of wealth garnered very quickly by using network effects and an interest rate regime that inflated their net worth and feelings of worth.Look at this child and his advice and who he is giving the advice to:https://patrickcollison.com/adviceAt some point people may conclude that the old legal framework was just a facade for hyper looting. That may in turn lead to the conclusion that it doesn‚Äôt much matter who owns or runs an entity and given how it was created a change of rules and a change of ownership is perfectly legitimate.Counting on a craven, even Satanic set of rulers to reform a system that has at every sentence a contradiction, incoherency or lie is just not going to happen. Listen to the psychopathic oligarch emissaries promoting AI. They never mention the people and what their duty is to them. It is the same old stuff. They are concerned with being on par with China and concerned about what will happen with Our Democracy in the same breath as talking about how this is going to destroy work and rob meaning for everyone. Look at who they worship. This dysgenic, pillow biting guy who looks like a radiated ant larvae ‚Äì Noah Yuval Harari. He snarls with contempt at the billions of useless eaters on this planet. How are people who have no morals and who are not phased by demons like Harari whose every statement violates their ethical and moral code and yet who hold him up as a grand historian going to reform this?Answer: They will not because they cannot.

            A tiny black pill for those who retain somegeographicalhope. Few days ago I put on NHK for background noise while working. Bit nostalgic, hadn‚Äôt done that for years, as it‚Äôs just another TV network now, almost the same as the rest in the white (honorary) world, though still less loud.Power-tooling away to the old relaxing sounds, I heard a pleasant voice say that in the next segment they were bringing on an American-looking expert to explain Trump to the Japanese‚Äîwho insist, against the wishes of their televisions, on thinking pretty well of him. (Didn‚Äôtquitesay that. They neverquitesay anything. But you understand.)It was Yuval Harari.

This kind of stuff reminds me why I‚Äôve come to hate the ‚Äútech‚Äù world and almost everyone in it. The only well known people I still sort of respect are guys like Linus Torvalds who are now shunned by man-children like this kid who populate startups and technology meetups.

        I‚Äôd suspect that the managerial class going after Musk over the past five years or so was noticed by his fellow economic elite.
Let‚Äôs also not forget the reaction to Oct. 7. The managerial class turned out to be much less reliable to our ethnic elite.
Both the economic and ethnic elite have decided that some housecleaning is in order.

        ‚ÄúIf you are a rich person, you should not want to undermine order, as it is the rules that make you rich. You got your wealth because of the system, so the system is your friend.‚ÄùTwo separate things ‚Äî the rules and the system. To become rich, you either have to break the rules or at least find flaws and loopholes in them, often with legal assistance. One sentence in Mario Puzo‚Äôs novel, ‚ÄúFools Die‚Äù, is ‚ÄúYou get rich in the dark.‚Äù The system is the social, financial, industrial, and political structure already existing and to some extent this can be against you as an upstart arriviste. Once you‚Äôve been accepted at the top ‚Äî and this may take more than one generation ‚Äî you naturally become a supporter of the status quo. I see that you talk about bending the rules and finding loopholes further on in your essay.Let me maintain a moment of respectful silence for the martyrdom of that pious and peaceful saint, George of Floyd, who was wantonly and brutally murdereed five years back.

            Regular rich and ‚ÄúOligarch‚Äù rich is a useful distinction to make here. Regular rich can be achieved without breaking laws or finding loopholes ‚Äì think your local beer distributor, owner of a few car dealerships, owner of 50 McDonalds etc. Oligarch rich requires breaking a few eggs.

                Yes. Also there is a phenomenon I call ‚ÄúCloud-adjacent.‚Äù Even the oligarch-rich sometimes don‚Äôt qualify, as was the case with Bill Gates, who despite his immense wealth never quite got into the club. For example, his connection to Epstein was thrown in his face although that didn‚Äôt happen to some with far less wealth. Most of the Cloud-adjacent are as you describe, incredibly wealth but not THAT wealthy.

        JD Vance spoke at the Naval Academy a few days ago and did a great job. Apparently, a large number of the graduates were making peace signs and those bizarre fish face poses into the cameras as they passed by. They showed a lack of decorum and self discipline.While it isn‚Äôt clear how beholden Vance is to our greatest ally, he frequently says things that give a bit of hope for the future:‚ÄúWe had a long experiment in our foreign policy that traded national defense and the maintenance of our alliances for nation building and meddling in foreign countries‚Äô affairs, even when those foreign countries had very little to do with core American interests. What we‚Äôre seeing from President Trump is a generational shift in policy with profound implications for the job that each and every one of you will be asked to do.‚Äù

Very telling.
My dad graduated King‚Äôs Point in the 1940s, Merchant Marine. There was no mugging or fish-faces after their graduation ceremony, I expect.
Even in the Seventies, when I was in the military, decorum was kept and the academies graduated serious men, not spoiled little boys. Once again, we see the influence of the feminization of the culture, and the absence of strong ‚Äî or even present ‚Äî fathers.

        The elites of the world are interconnected. Even the Chinese send their kids to Harvard. It would make sense in such a world for them to share certain presumptions and belief systems. One of their fundamental beliefs, going against Christianity, is that greed is good. They look in the mirror and multiply what they see to the larger society. The attributes of the very wealthy, based on stock and real estate ownership, come more and more to resemble a soulless machine bent on endless consumption, from megayachts to gigantic homes. There is no place for ordinary humanity in these privileged lives.

                Harvard and the Ivy League are finishing schools for lifelong warriors against males, whites, heterosexuals, and Christians.
Trump is removing $100 million of fed contracts from Harvard.  It‚Äôs a good beginning, a typical Trump financial move, but noteworthy because against a Citadel of the Enemy.
But don‚Äôt argue with what hates you.  Time‚Äôs a-wastin.
A better beginning would be raze Harvard and the Ivy League and lime the soil carefully.  Salt also will do.

                    Trump is singling out a handful of universities and using the federal government to dictate what can be said and not said on campus. If you say the wrong words, you will be charged with a ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù and your career ends at 20 years of age.Banning just one university from enrolling foreign students is legally laughable. Either they are a threat to all universities, or none. Will he deport Chinese from all engineering programs? Indians? Of course not. But the danger is more pronounced from Chinese students than Arab ones.There is no legal basis for this action other than ressentiment of Harvard, which is no different from a Biden administration official‚Äôs hatred of a Christian university. That so many have eagerly embraced this without any thought shows the stupidity of The Stupid Party once again. This is a Rubicon being crossed, and the payback will be brutal. And if there‚Äôs one thing I know about conservatives, they will sit back and complain when it happens, and then, start talking about voting again.

                Harvard graduates claiming intellectual superiority


The most difficult thing about Harvard is getting admitted. Once you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôre in the network and the coursework is not all that rigorous.

                    The thing about Harvard, really about H-Y-P (also true about medical school) is the credential is a done deal the day you get the acceptance letter. This is not true of lesser ‚Äúcow colleges‚Äù, where you can actually get ‚ÄúC‚Äùs or even flunk out.Harvard acceptance = Harvard degree. It‚Äôs a tautology ‚Äì if you were smart enough to get accepted, how can anyone there allege you are not smart enough to graduate? More than that, how can anyone give you less than an ‚ÄúA‚Äù?And this is why Moms in Newton, The Upper West Side, Great Neck, etc are engaged in ruthless social combat while the Dads in finance pile up the cash, to make sure the correct 2 year old Montessori program recognizes the extreme value of their little one (and it‚Äôs usually just one). The credentials track, the real one ‚Äì the (almost) no output/extreme reward track, starts as soon as Mom decides not to abort.The real threat to Harvard (if there is one) is the impending ‚ÄúEmperor has no clothes‚Äù moment ‚Äì the moment when George Wallace rises from the grave and declares, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt nothin‚Äô in that briefcase ‚Äòceptin a peanut butter sandwich‚Äù

            This is one of the better posts from Greg-GPT. I remember reading about the president of NYU, I think, and she was clearly a cosmpolitan elite who saw herself as a global citizen, not an American. They don‚Äôt see their place in the world in terms of the country, it‚Äôs just a temporary stopping off point. I think very few of these elites see themselves as American, or Chinese, or French, or British, or Italian, or what have you, at least not primarily. I also think this is a relatively new phenomenon. Only one segment of the elite see themselves first and foremost in terms of their ethnic identity but that‚Äôs another thing‚Ä¶.By the way, I also think this attitude has trickled down to normies. Especially in Europe. The rise of the ‚Äúdigital nomad‚Äù reflects that. Ultimately they are rootless cosmopolitans who are dependent on Pax Americana and the system but do not have the riches to be true elites.

They are cheap and easily assembled. They do not require a human interface. Two battery packs give them a range of 50 miles. They can lie in wait for days. They can swarm. They are now the most deadly force on the modern battlefield.

            While the transformation of warfare by networked drones is clear, I assert that the transformation by precision hypersonic munitions is even more profound. It has not yet manifest but the potential is obvious.Historically, most elites during wartime have had a great aversion for killing top political decision-makers on the other side. The present leadership culture of the Russian Federation is very legally formalistic. One doesn‚Äôt kill individuals at the highest levels of institutions of authority, because one wants to force them to the negotiating table. If one kills off the individuals (like for example wiping out the Ukrainian Rada, the last figleaf of Ukrainian ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô), then there is no one with whom to legitimate a war-ending deal. This aversion is especially true for diplomatic personnel. You do not kill the people who will negotiate the deal, or those who will cement the deal‚Äôs legitimacy inside the opposing polity.Neoliberal democracy is defined as a system where the people elect individuals into institutions of authority (senates, parliaments, presidencies, etc) but those individuals never exercise sovereign power. Power and authority are essentially completely decoupled, with actual power exercisedfrom the electoral sidelinesby those who control the individuals with carrot and stick, bribes supplemented with extrajudicial violence for the noncompliant.It is clear that at least some elements of the Euro(‚Ç¨)-centric transnational empire are attempting to gear Europe up for a general war against Russia. Of course, they hope to drag hapless Americans into it, too. However, if such a war comes to pass, the Russians now have the capability to eradicate the power behind authority without great general destruction, by targeting the financialist networks that are the root driving force behind the bellicosity.They don‚Äôt have to destroy armies and physical economic capability to influence decision-making by institutions of authority, because those in Europe (and America) surrendered sovereignty to transnational banksters a long time ago. Ruthlessly cull the banksters by destroying them inside their long-ago-geolocated chateaus and mansions and banking houses, and they will order their Romney/Macron/Starmer-like monkeys in the institutions of authority to sue for peace.Even better would be to keep going until the networks of power are completely shattered, and actual power by default shifts back into the institutions of authority, from whence it should never have been allowed to leave. If there is ever going to be peace for European people, then (((merchant rule))) in the West must end. If Russians truly want an end to the permanent hostility towards them by those who actually rule the West, then this is what must happen. Obviously it would be better for everyone if such a power-authority-recoupling process occurred through internal political reform, but if globohomo starts World War 3, it can be done with hypersonic missiles.

                Excellent analysis. I agree completely. And I would add the following distinction, hypersonics are a state weapon. FPVs belong to the people. Any future rising will be qualitatively different from the past. Anonymity, surprise, and focus can now successfully originate from the bottom of the social pyramid. The peons no longer have to wait for Bongino to grow a pair.

        I largely agree with your arguments z, but there‚Äôs another big factor you missed with why elites support this stuff: self-loathing and guilt. Off the top of my head, the Tsar‚Äôs daughter wore the red ribbon in support of the socialists‚Ä¶the same ones that would murder her whole family. This ties closely with the points you made. They can see the randomness of their blessings, and their lack of real skills or talent, and they feel incredibly guilty and want to punish themselves to an extent.

        It is a form of pulling up the drawbridge behind them so new schemers cannot get in on the action.That is a huge part of it, no doubt. Monopolies have to be defended against even theoretical competition. There also is an aspect odd yet predictable: intra-elite turf wars. Those on that side of the drawbridge also are jealous of one another.I predicted a couple of years ago that we would see Cloud on Cloud violence emerge. That was framed as one having another assassinated, and while that may yet come to pass, it took the form of a new drawbridge being erected. The OG tech and finance oligarchs slowly are being replaced much like the white men they sought to destroy. Schwab*, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates** and perhaps even Musk and Soros*** are being pushed to the margins by the likes of Altman and Thiel and Karp. That‚Äôs not necessarily a good thing for us, either, but it might be. It definitely is happening albeit in a bloodless way thus far.Open borders and limiting energy supplies, among other issues, were designed to benefit the OG gang but sometimes work contrary to the needs of the up and coming robber barons. Therefore, we see the hiring of new Help and Hos to implement policies that are contrary to what the previous elected hookers delivered.*The story was quickly disappeared, but Klaus Schawb was accused of embezzling the WEF after he announced his retirement (World Economic Forum founder investigated for possible embezzlement). Announcements of medical problems followed quickly. This may have been a stepped up version of the marginalization, not quite at the assassination level but getting there.**Gates is among the handful of Pedo Island visitors who routinely have it pointed out to his face. He never has been fully part of the club, to the sure, showing that mere wealth is not enough. See Donald J. Trump for a similar example of this.***The revelation that the much-hyped Soros political philanthropy was a money-laundering scheme from which he profited emerged with DOGE.

        One of the constants is the elite obsession with keeping wages low. The modern version is ‚Äúyou will own nothing and be happy.‚Äù If you own nothing, you will be dependent on whatever resources the elite (who own everything) care to send your way. It will be minimal. With production done by robots and AI, the typical human will be a useless eater.

        Thus, within the West, the second Trump presidency, following the ‚ÄòBiden Era‚Äô socio-economic and legal-moral bankruptcy of its system of governance and reflecting the post-‚Äò9/11‚Äô, post-‚ÄòCovid‚Äô, post-‚ÄòQAnon‚Äô implosion of its public trust, may be said to mark a perceptual tipping point: this is point at which the boundary between reality and fiction breaks down and at which the audience and the actors merge. The line dividing the carefully choreographed LARPs of the Washington spin-doctors and the Hollywood mind-benders from real-life psychopathy and kinetic violence has been crossed. Ironically but appropriately, this emerging ‚Äòalternative reality‚Äô is ushered in by former reality show and talk radio host Donald Trump, now appointed Entertainer-in-Chief. At the sounding of this second ‚Äòtrump‚Äô, in the twinkling of an eye, all is changed: nightmarish forces, including demonic entities and ghoulish dispositions long ago cast out into the outer dark by Christian morality, are now pouring back into waking reality through the crumbling ‚Äòwalls of the world‚Äô. Taking possession of the ‚Äòlost souls‚Äô of the West, they will inflict their ‚Äò15 minutes‚Äô of triumph on an unsuspecting humanity:ab occidente tenebrae.Hell is empty and all the devils are here‚Äì Shakespeare,The Tempesthttps://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2025/05/24/the-heresiarchs/

        ‚ÄúThis could explain the growing war on credentialism.‚ÄùThe conceptual model here at its most abstract is oligarchs versus managerials. I don‚Äôt disagree, but my open question to those who think the end of the dissolution-of-the-old-order process must result in reestablishment of European homelands is ‚Äúdo we have a dog in this fight?‚ÄùI feel kind of Churchillian in that it would be great if the oligarchs and managerials would kill each other off like Churchill hoped German Nazis and Soviet Communists would, before the Germans started unexpectedly winning. It would be great if it were literal. Put Bill Gates and whoever has assumed control of the Rothschild empire into a gladiator arena with say 10 50-year-old obese purple-haired harridans. All of them would be naked but with a shortsword. Only the survivors of one side get to leave the pit (for the next round). If they refuse to fight they get to starve until they fight. Pres. Trump, in the best traditions of the American merchant class, could sell tickets for ringside seats and streaming.

        I sadly don‚Äôt see the politics of the bizarre ending. Rather, it looks like the temporary respite we had in November 2024 is now ending.Musk is leaving politics, probably moving as much money as he can out of the reach of the Regime. Warren and the other Senate Harpies are threatening Skydance / Larry Ellison, and Paramount / Sheri Redstone, with all sorts of problems including jail time if Paramount/CBS settles with Trump and so forth. Bezos is seeing a revolt on the pages of the Washington Post. The Murdochs are all in on the Hate Trump train, funding lots of Kamala! events in Australia and funding her book. The WSJ might as well be the Daily Kos.Its an even bet if a District Court Judge removes Trump and Vance and installs Kamala before the Rinos throw the Midterms and have Hakeem Jeffries impeach, and Chuck Schumer convict, Trump and Vance to make Jeffries the third black president. [After Bill and Barack].All the elites have is money. The crazies have power, real power. Power enough to motivate one of the sons of an SEIU bigshot to journey to DC to murder people he did not even know. That Elias Rodriguez‚Äôs dad, Eric, was a guest of a Chicago DC Congressman at the State of the Union, and spent about 45 minutes meeting with Obama at Obama‚Äôs DC mansion is suggestive. The killer is alive, unharmed, and is already being pushed as a hero in Lefty media. So expect wave after wave of Lefty inspired/organized violence just like 2020, more lawfare, more judges asserting power on behalf of the Managers, and probably a lefty coup. When Vance attended the West Point Graduation, he was roundly mocked by the Cadets, reportedly, who made peace signs and funny faces.  That does not happen by accident.Look at Disney. Bob Iger wants Kevin Feige to dial down the craziness, and make money with Marvel. Feige has told him no. You‚Äôd think Iger would just fire Feige and hire whoever he wants: Favreau, another Downey Jr. crony, Ryan Reynolds or his cronies, Hollywood is not short of people who could do a better job than Feige for cheaper and make money. But Iger cannot fire Feige because the latter has social media, the Party, and the crazies in the bureaucracy, judgeships, media, and more at his back.The crazies have power and mass both. Power in the bureaucracies of everything, and mass in that there are a ton of them all over. Get rid of one at great cost and you will change nothing. The Oligarchs are learning too late that their wealth makes them tempting targets for power. Real power rests in crazy girlboss judges, the woke officer corp, and crazy lefty bureaucrats. Your black pill of the day I suppose. Meaning a crisis likely this Summer as the Crazies go all in.

            You are alive at the end of a century-plus full of efforts to destroy everything good and virtuous that pre-existed the 20th century. Nearly all of it is gone, and those who claim to uphold it, know little of it aside from a deep emotional sense of loss and aimelessness.You cannot build something new with those alive now, including us. We are all sick and tainted by modernity and our times. All of the people you describe, they will not change, they have been formed, and they will live for 70, 80 years in the fashion you describe. Now multiply that by billions over a century or more, and the damage they would cause in that time.It‚Äôs here. It‚Äôs all around us.

        Spectacular Z.All too true in my opinion but it begs a few questions. It may be picking the fly chit out of the pepper‚Ä¶ but I think broadly blaming capitalism is too loose a way to frame it. I might think a better way to frame it would be to call it ‚Äúvulture capitalism‚Äù? Under capitalism the onus is on investment, risk, and reward. The venture capitalist used to understand that if he invested in his company there would be a return on that investment, and he would re-invest that return in his own company. Henry Ford was a prime example: he offered top wages to his employees at the height of the great depression. It is easy to understand why he was a virulent antisemite and the jews and socialists (but I repeat myself) ‚Äì hated him right back. We saw this among the Silent Generation. They wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to make huge sacrifices and investments for their kids, not caring that they would never see or reap the benefits of those sacrifices. Today the Boomers hate their kids and can only complain about them. All they care about is themselves and taking their money (and that of their kids and grandkids) to the grave with them.The next question is that the current system has to fail. Just like every other great civilization and empire before ours ‚Äì it‚Äôs clearly rotting from within. There is no fixing this. What system do you propose to replace it?I personally think what‚Äôs killing isn‚Äôt necessarily capitalism. If you look at the Chinese, for example‚Ä¶they are a house of cards about to fall into ruin too. Is it a lack of morality that underlies our decline and fall? Moral countries dont run like this.Not to be a Bible thumper‚Ä¶but the kinds of failures we see today are not really possible under a Godly system that forbids the ‚Äúdo unto others then split‚Äù mentality. Personally it seems to me that the decline of America went into a steep nose dive when the Greatest Generation passed on. Sure, they had their turdies and black hearts too‚Ä¶but they were not nearly as adversarial with each other as we are today.It seems to me that unless we can come to some kind of shared values and morality to drive our economics and culture ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre doomed. It is a truism that people get the govts they want and deserve‚Ä¶ and any improvement will have to start with we the people, and not they the politicians and oligarchs‚Ä¶But whadda I know? Am I barking up the wrong tree again?

Elon and Tesla was under investigation and there was a real chance he was going to end up in jail. So he backed Trump knowing that Trump would be loyal to those loyal to him. Investigation goes away.  SBF is a good example too.  He had lots and lots of influence and now he is sitting in federal prison.  Granted, it is rare and the rich get away with most of their shenanigans. But at the end of the day, the state is power.  Musk does not and cannot field an army. He cannot put people in prison.

            That assumes the managerial state to be self governing. For small things, that may be true, but for large things, things that the real rulers care about, I‚Äôm skeptical that it is.

                Well, I‚Äôm treating it as a tautology. Anyone in the political/managerial system is, by tautology, part of the managerial class.
I‚Äôm also not trying to ignore influence, which can be very close to having actual power.  Like because Musk has the full support of Trump, this is practically very close to having power himself.
But Musk is making a lot of enemies and Trump has less than 4 years in office left.  The bad guys might win in 28, then Musk will learn the difference between influence and power.

        Sounds like you are trying to give advice to the oligarchs: ie, the same people trying to destroy the White population of this country. Why?
