        Funny thing, Mr. Z. You indicated that lead is the main cause for a 20% increase in crime. Lead is also the main cause for a decrease in crime. In this case, it doesn‚Äôt care about race, some criminals die of lead poisoning, one bullet at a time.üôÇ

        Lead pipes weren‚Äôt the problem in Rome.  Elemental lead is not very soluble in water and does not get absorbed well into the body.  The Romans were getting lead poisoning because they were pouring vinegar onto lead plates, scraping off the resultant white powder (lead acetate), and using it as mankind‚Äôs first artificial sweetner.The rising lead levels in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs were mostly due to the tons of tetra-ethyl lead fuel additive being pumped out the tailpipes of our cars and sucked into our lungs.  Like lead acetate, tetra-ethyl lead is easily absorbed into the body.  There were some incidents of kids eating paint chips (which also used an organic lead compound) but since lead paint was used extensively in the U.S. before 1978, it wasn‚Äôt just getting ingested by poor kids.  That was just The Narrative, the Early Days.Last time I had cause to check (1995), lead blood levels in the U.S. had fallen by 90% from their early 70‚Äôs highs.  That was mostly due to the ban on leaded fuel.  Period.  During that same time frame, we also went from moon landings to Michael Jackson andFriends, so I‚Äôm not seeing the causation.If general air pollution causes kids to be dumb and violent, then the pre-catalytic converter Southern California of my youth should have been something akin to Dawn of the Living Dead with packs of flesh eating teen zombies roaming the malls, skate parks, and miniature golf courses.  Also, there should there should have been a clear rising gradient of violent crazy from the coast to the I-5 corridor to the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys.  Amazingly La Canada, Encino, Pasadena, and San Dimas in the valleys cranked out hordes of smart kids and even some CIF Southern Section championship sports teams (I shudder thinking of practices in stage two smog alerts).  Inglewood and Long Beach on the coast, not so much.I stopped taking Drum seriously about fifteen years ago when he was flogging some Courier-type piece of crazy as the Texas Republican Party platform.  I think that it took me about ten minutes to find the real state party platform and establish that the document he was pushing was a county platform from some backwoods part of the state still fighting the War of Northern Aggression.  Instead of being thanked for my research, I was attacked for being a troll and agent provocateur.  I have few illusions about the Cult.

        When I was a yoof, most homes in the UK had lead pipes. I presume then drinking water would have meant intolerable levels of crime everywhere. Plus lead was in paint so pausing for liquid refreshment while decorating your home was really asking for trouble.
Oddly, despite all this lead around murder and mayhem was not that noticeable in places I lived.
Anyway, the warning is clear: Watch out for the underclass chewing painted wood.

        Lead poisoning was called Saturnism in Antiquity, at least the crack epidemic could have been blamed on the CIA.
