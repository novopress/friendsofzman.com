        Maybe whites should start asking how the incredible amount of black on white crime could happen?  Oops sorry for noticing.

        Given that this was about Mike Brown, I wonder if the unnamed white co-worker has since brought the subject up again with Mr. Carl Jones and asked him how he feels about things now that it is clear the “this could happen” because a thug attacked a police officer and tried to take his firearm from him after robbing a store
It might make for a lively conversation…

        “How do you know the shooting wasn’t justified?”
The answer to this question wasn’t supplied, I presume. Probably the good old  ‘pressure of space’ excuse in the newspaper business forced the writer to skip over that part. Still, the righteous position was nicely summarised by the phrase ‘Others averted their eyes and finished the meal in silence’ as this hints at guilt and shame and clear evidence of unconscious racism.
Thank goodness the journalist had room to get that in.

        I’m surprised that the guy who suggested that the shooting may have been justified wasn’t dragged down to HR and reprimanded.
