            Ah, sodium…keep your fingers oily and you’re safe…kept in a jar of oil, we used to flick pieces of it over the heads of fishermen at the dock…(same as a stick of dynamite but it is minuscule, so unnoticed)

                Oh, you kids, with your rollerskates and your twenty-three skidoo and your fanny packs and your Pong and your I-don’t-know-what… Time for Tom, Mike and Crow to teach you something about Sodium, through the rock ‘n roll music that the kids seem to like:

                    Thank you Dr. for the sodium song.I somehow missed that in my chemistry studies.
Sodium also gets a mention in this Tom Lehrer song,but you have to pay attention to catch it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcS3NOQnsQMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGM-wSKFBpo

        Ifthis article(and the endless string of absolutely suicidal comments) is any clue, then a lot of the Cult’s outer party (lesser priesthood?) seem to think that the magic is going away.I have times referred to the progressives as a death cult, but until I read this, I really didn’t have a gut feeling for how meaningless and empty they see life as.I was tempted to taunt the commenters, but that would be like making fun of a guy standing on a ledge.I don’t mind them all killing themselves off.  I just don’t want them to take any of us Proles with them.Merry Christmas, everyone.

            Interesting article. Ben Franklin described a learned blockhead is only a greater blockhead. This woman adores but can’t even  properly parse Nietzsche’s phrase “Man will sooner will nothingness than not will.” but this is no bar to mangling it’s simple understanding. If only she would read Nietzxche’s rant againstf George Eliot perhaps she would stop abusing the dead.“They are rid of the Christian God and now believe all the more firmly that they must cling to Christian morality. That is an English consistency; we do not wish to hold it against little moralistic females a la Eliot. In England one must rehabilitate oneself after every little emancipation from theology by showing in a veritably awe-inspiring manner what a moral fanatic one is. That is the penance they pay there…We others hold otherwise. When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one’s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident: this point has to be exhibited again and again, despite the English flatheads. Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one’s hands.”

        The greatest works of man are those things reassembled from opposing forces. It is increasingly obvious that Progressives are post-Christians who cracked the flywheel of his civilization, retaining an evangelical belief in man’s perfection without going to the trouble of learning his restrictions. A half Muslim is an improvement over a Muslim; a half-Christian is a great deal worse.

        And magic dirt? Don’t be silly, when we all know it’s a curse!
When they opened King Tuts tomb back in 1922 they unleashed the curse of the pharaohs over the middle east… See, it’s again all SCIENCE.
Or are you a denier and don’t believe in Egyptology? I say re-seal it!

        I have this mental picture of the followers of the Magic Negro following him around, collecting his fingernail clippings and the output of his daily constitutionals, and studying them intensely for the roots of his incredible awesomeness.  I do not think a reasonable conversation could be had with people such as those.

                I think you missed my point.  Some fans of Obama have no concern about his policy positions, the real world effects of such positions, the truthfulness of the things he says, whether the words and the actions have any relationship to each other, or where his loyalties lie, if anywhere.  It is all about Obama, and some sort of mystique that he carries, in their eyes.  Hence the widely used term, “Magic Negro”.  Having any sort of rational conversation with such people is impossible, because there is nothing rational to their devotion to some sort of totem that goes by the name of “Obama”.  I have witnessed such behavior from extended family members at holiday functions, in which they throw out the most odd statements.  I suppose they are seeking affirmation of their devotion, but are instead met with awkward silence.  They are absolutely bewildered by our lack of enthusiastic affirmation of their views, and they cannot fathom that anyone might not share their eccentric attitudes (e.g. “Republicans hate Obama because he is black”, “Republicans want Obama dead”).  How does one reason with such opinions?  I was trying to be figurative, not literal, in my original post.  I hope you understand that.I suppose there are a few who reflexively hate the idea of Obama as president, just because.  In my experience, those who do not support him really do not like his policies, his attitudes, and the way he functions as president.

                    Two years ago, Ace wrote this essay on “The MacGuffinization of American Politics”:http://ace.mu.nu/archives/345514.phpThe reason we can’t discuss issues with leftists is because issues don’t really exist for them.  What exists is a movie:  “The Hero’s Quest”, starring Barack Obama as The Hero.  The things we think are important: freedom of speech, border security, energy development, etc., are issues to US, but them, they’re the trolls and collapsing bridges the Hero has to overcome.  As such, they don’t really matter; what matters is that the Hero triumphs, to the applause of his adoring audience.And we, of course, have our role in the movie too: we’ve been cast as the Villains, or Impediments.  Our role is simply to be against the Hero.  Oh, they might spend a few seconds on a little cod-psychology for us, just to flesh out our character to make the contest more fun, (i.e., conservatives are racists)  but really we don’t need any deeper motivation than that we’re against  the Hero.

        It’s not magic, it’s SCIENCE!
As far they are concerned, modern science affirms ALL progressive premises.The apocalypse? Crazy bible thumper talk, but climate doom, pure cold logic…
Progressives are almost orthodox at this point, all they need is a dress code!

        Given the radically different behavior exhibited by Pakistani Muslims and Indian hindus there’s something to be said for magical dirt theory. If you take a Pakistani baby, send him to the West and have him adopted, he’ll undoubtedly grow up to be a very different man than he would if raised by his own parents in his own society (regardless of what garden you plant them in).

                The number of Brits who convert to Islam and then self-detonate or plot to self-detonate is worth considering.The percentage of self-detonators among converts is at least as high or higher than that of native Muslims.For that matter, British culture has changed considerably since the dark ages, long before its recent demographic changes.There are plenty of Indian Hindus in Britain. Ethnically they’re no different than the Pakistanis but their behavior in Britain is nothing alike, neither in terms of criminality and violence, nor in terms of Jihad.

                    I’d like to some some data on the the number of British, Anglo-Saxons, Welsh and Scots who convert and then go on jihad. My bet is you will find data that includes second gen Asians as native Brits.
As far as Pakistan and India, the difference is obvious when you see it up close.

                        I’ve no idea where to find that data, but it is known that these converts are native Brits.Although you might want to read this articlehttp://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/09/09/ginger-jihadis-why-redheads-are-attracted-to-radical-islam/
Quote: ” In the Daily Mail archives, 69 per cent of white Brits lured into jihadism or the orbit of an extremist preacher were ginger.”
So we are talking about actual native Brits, not second generation immigrants.

                That Jihad or “self detonation” is a new thing with Islam and the legacy of Osama Bin Laden…Before, despite all the toxicity of the umma, one noticeable attribute was cowardise. The bravery of a muslim was proportional to his distance from the battlefield.Remember how Charles Martel beat them, by going around and jumping on the rearguard where le loot was stacked. Faced by our own berserkers, the muslims always cut and ran. Now, they all seem to turn into a mafia of berserkers, like the Pablo Escobar narcos or the terrorist gang of Abu Nidal…At this stage, they mostly attack each others and it prove to be the cult’s last gasp…

                The problem is that the Jihadists haven’t been exposed to enough magic dirt.  They need to be completely covered by it to a depth of several feet, preferably for a duration of several weeks, for it to work.
Magic dirt will solve all our problems.
