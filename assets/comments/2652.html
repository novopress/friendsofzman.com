        Given the recent history of one immigrant videographer we may not hear from this guy for a year or two. One hopes at least this case keeps two or three hundred enforcers of the public morals occupied for the month.

        This story is less about the depredations of the therapeutic state and an uncontrolled police force, and more about the death of the media.  Jeffey Goldberg, the author of the shrill, hysterical Atlantic piece, was right to make a few phone calls, and wrong to publish before receiving answers.  There is more to the story.“Dr.” K. S. Voltaer AKA Patrick McLaw, AKA Patrick Beale is 23 years old.  His novels are self-published dreck, available only on Kindle.  Officials knew about the “books” in 2012, and they played no part in this incident.  The incident was touched off by a four page letter McLaw sent to county officials that led to concerns for the author’s mental state.  McLaw has not been arrested, but is being treated in the bughouse.  There are also allegations of harassment, and of criminal activity involving an improper relationship with a minor.Sounds to me like some perv got caught and threatened to off himself.  Typical.

        “…It now seems that Mr. McLaw was removed because of a number of issues, mostly centered around a letter he sent to a school official that was described as “suicidal”. From there authorities performed a limited search of Mr. McLaw’s home, which he consented to, and found a model of a school building and some more material they deemed worrying.”The media has been playing up the notion that he’s been “disappeared” for writing fiction. Journalists at one time used to ask questions, do a a little leg work on a story. McLaw’s attorney has said that his client was taken in for a mental health evaluation and is receiving treatment.In other news, apparently sales of his two books have been booming of late.
