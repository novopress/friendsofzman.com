        “Each decision you face is the result of previous decisions. If you make a bad move on step three, but only discover it at step nine, you have an accumulation of bad decisions to contend with…”Reminds me of years ago when I was a tank platoon leader.  An Infantry PL asked me how I felt about my “personal weapon” being a Beretta pistol rather than an M-16.I told him, “I start the battle with 4 M1A1C tanks.  If it ever comes to having to defend myself with a 9mm pistol, I’ve made so many mistakes I deserve to die.”The point is – there are jobs and situations where being wrong simply isn’t acceptable and it will be punished in the most severe fashion.  Maybe we should begin imposing that standard on our politicians.

        About “This may seem obvious, but analysts are often prone to reductionism, assuming groups are working like individuals. The most obvious example of methodological reductionism is the mythological Zionist conspiracy.”Actually the Austrian economists have seen this mistaken tendency among “analysts” as what you could call the “reductionism” of viewing individuals working as members of their assigned groups. This is historically and empirically visible in Keynesian economics, the Grand Delusion of economists who cannot believe that people are unpredictable.As fascinating a series as is the Foundation series from Isaac Asimov, that “psychohistory” is superstitious nonsense. Individual actions can NOT be predicted. Individual valuations cannot be predicted either. This is just one reason the Federal Reserve has ALWAYS been such a miserable failure at what it was purportedly created for, the real purpose being the stealth promotion of oligarchy.Like when Greenspan once testified before the Monetary Policy committee, saying that the Fed could “simulate” a gold standard in its decisions, Ron Paul observed that he said this “with such a straight face”. –Greenspan had been once upon a time a friend of Ayn Rand, and had advocated the gold standard in earlier days.As to the “Zionist conspiracy”, one cannot so easily dismiss the complications of history as facile musings of non-thinkers, especially given the known historical fact that it required a LOT of “Zionist conspiracy” to do what Irgun and Stern Gang did in 1947 and 1948, and a LOT of stealth preparation besides to carry out their operations, even under the nose of British authorities. It took a mini-“Zionist conspiracy” to blow up the Hotel David for example. Deir Yassin had absolutely no idea what the plans were of the “Zionist conspiracy”. The plan according to the OFFICIAL Israeli histories are that Begin’s Irgun operatives were to send all the village’s residents fleeing and to demolish all resistance, and that the villagers defending their lifetime homes and livelihood was not a reason to disobey their warnings to flee.(“God is not mocked… Whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he also reap.” “He that liveth by the sword shall die by the sword.”)

        “Kids in the decades after World War II had a consistent material life up into the 80’s and then things started to change rapidly with the microprocessor.”This isn’t true.  You’re mistaking “material” gains with information technology.  It is true that there has been rapid increase in information technologies to the point that many innovations seem to be at a standstill.  The reality is that they did not stand still.  There were amazing material gains in the decades following WWII, that for some reason; that these amazing gains were overshadowed by the shockingly, and completely unprecedented, speed of information tech innovation doesn’t mean they did not exist.The shipping container revolutionized global trade, significantly dropping the price of shipping costs and dramatically reducing the time it took to load and unload ships.Air travel innovation democratized air travel, doing for air travel what Ford did for automobiles.Vaccines were discovered that prevented the the greatest killers of humanity that haunted our existence from the beginning.  Some diseases we wiped right off the map.Some are even greater than the information innovations, such as the incredible medical advances, moving to the point where it was often times worse to go to a doctor for serious medical intervention, to a significant drop if in death rates from many medical interventions.Economic growth has been exponential since roughly 1800, including the entirety of the twentieth century.  Even the so-called “Great Depression” is a minor blip in a logarithmic graph of the American economy from 1900-2000.  The time period of 1945-1980 had just as much economic innovation and growth as the rest of the twentieth century.

        Are these things true?1. A Rothschild was proposed the idea of creating modern Israel by an early Jehovah’s Witness leader in the 1880s?2. The man who helped negotiate the Balfour Declaration was a Zionist Jew who pushed for the speaking of Yiddish over Hebrew, and this man is a candidate for the author of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion?3. Why did ghettos and the Pale of Settlement exist?4. When was the creation of the earliest synagogue?  Where was it?5. What kind of people would Jews be if they were on average with IQs in the low 90s?(hint…Israel’s National IQ – 90 Points )

        I hereby christen your theory The Bumbling Through Theory of Everything. And, it’s probably closer to the truth than most, if not all theories of civilization (if there are any; I’m not a civilizationologist by a long shot).

        I’m glad to see you acknowledge the possibility of breaking free of these past events restraints. I believe as individuals we are constrained only by our fears and failure of imagination. The individual is, after all, as Carl Jung put it, the only reality.

            The trouble with this truth is that is also requires a high degree of  understanding. Absent that, it is the calling card of the Progressive–We don’t need to be constrained by the past, or even instructed by it. We are brilliant. Forward!

            In a society designed around the individual and his rights, there can be no minorities. You cannot divide the individual down below the one. If we all valued as individuals rather than a collective, we should experience the equality blathered about by the left. The differences between us would only be differentiated by our own actions and desires, ambitions and efforts. That is more natural way to exist than a gaggle of collectives, committees, think tanks, study groups, pretend charities and socialist ideas to name a few tar pits.

            There’s no doubt that people make plans, groups set goals and kingdoms have ambitions. My point here is that all of those are constrained by past events. The new king may have designs on new territory, but his grandfather’s choices may make it more or less possible for him to execute those designs.
