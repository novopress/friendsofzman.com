        When we write the obituary of the American Empire three things that are not polite to talk about must be talked about before anything new is begun.
1. Jewish power and its affect on us, especially since 1945.2. Female power and its affect on us since the 19th amendment.3. Race realism and why the truth must be told and acted upon or its impossible to build anything new.
Three subjects that are taboo right now  but must be faced to build anything new as this order weakens away.

                I have to say that if I had to choose one of these to focus on, it would be the second, the WQ.A simple analysis would hold that because we’ll never persuade women to give up their voting (&amp; other) privileges voluntarily, it will be that difference that will distinguish successful societies going forward. And it isn’t just an East vs West distinction either. MacArthur gave Japan a new constitution modeled after the American one and look where it’s led them. Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world. China is also experiencing a hollowing-out. The entire world has become feminized to varying degrees with plummeting birth rates even in SS Africa. Even Islam isn’t immune. But the only really resistant groups are found in the Islamic world, those of its more radical elements. There are some Christian holdouts, such as that pastor in Texas who said that women shouldn’t be allowed to vote, but he is viewed with horror by the rest of “Christian” society.Is there a more sophisticated analysis that overrides this simple analysis? I don’t see it. It has been observed that Native American societies that were the most bloodthirsty were matrilineal, a step away from matriarchy. There has never been widespread matriarchy until now. Death by a thousand cuts, that’s a uniquely feminine association. A slow death by a thousand cuts would be optimistic except that the franchise on the Bomb has been expanded and tactical nukes are “soberly” debated . So the possibility exists that there will be no successful societies at all going forward except for a few isolated tribes in the Amazon.

            Very powerful summary. Nice work. I’d only add that white men:
* when affluent, become the most gullible people on the planet (and the most generous).
* have a tendency towards abstract ideology, which no one else in the world shares. We look at a race war and conclude that the conflict is about “communism.”

                We look at a race war and conclude that the conflict is about “communism.”While it is not exactly right, it’s not entirely wrong.  Most of what ails us is at least talked about in equalitarian rhetoric and occasionally communism.The real problem isn’t that anyone views it through a lens of communism so much as their answer to it is just the flip side of communism, egalitarianism.Really, our preferences should not need rationalizations.  I don’t want them here because I don’t want to smell them, look at them or interact with them in any way.Opening our telecommunications to the rest of the world (cheaply) has made our phone system near useless.  Now you have to treat every single caller whose voice is not known to you as a scam of some sort.  That is one of the many (very large) costs that isn’t on a spreadsheet somewhere comparing the costs to the benefits this supposedly has.  How many of our seniors, who grew up in a society where the phone could be trusted have lost all or a significant portion of their life savings to phone scammers?

                    More egregiously, most all these spam calls could be stopped in a NY minute.  None of these calls are made without payment for the facility use to AT&amp;T (and derivatives—baby bells—across the nation).  They have the ability to listen in to these calls and suspend the account (ability to robocall call).  There might now be other notable players, but it’s the same choke point.  However, they want the revenue, so no action takes place on their end.

                    I appreciate the fine response Tars.  I especially resonate with “our preferences should not need rationalizations.”
However, I submit that if we could wipe away all the white man’s thoughts about communism, and its flip side egalitarianism, we would see our current world more accurately.

Doubtful. Essentially, that is a return to Kantian philosophy, which was replaced with post-Kantianism because it didn’t explain the empirical evidence. “Universalism” was wrong, but there’s no good answer (yet) for what is right. For some reason, people don’t perceive the world as any of the models predict.

        Good post but it isn’t just the feminization of the ruling class, it is also the feminization of the managerial class and the increasing role of women in society. For example, young men are starting to turn away from politics while young women are increasing their participation.Harris’ talk of joy appeals to women because they don’t have to understand boring issues, they just have to want to experience joy. Women also hate being accountable and don’t think in terms of statistics. So tying your advocacy to easily measured goals is a threat to them.You can see this played out in almost all western white countries. Women in Germany don’t care if the country is deindustrialized. They just want inclusiveness (just not for the ADF).

                Nice – from the Latin “nescius” – ignorant and foolish.  Gradually morphed into ‘fussy’ and then into ‘agreeable’ and ‘pleasant.’  A useless, meaningless word suited to a world run for useless women.

                    Agreed, but harsh.  Women have the greater role of either sex—child bearing and child rearing.  They’vejust been told the “great lie” wrt to their role in society.  To which I provide visible proof—even the worst scumbag on earth with take your head off if you screw with their mother, not so much for dad.

                        Women who eschew marriage and children – their innate biological and social function – to pretend to be police officers or to harass men as office managers – are useless.  And yes, every nogger claims eternal fealty to his mama – this is not a sterling example of the maternal role and import.  For western Christians, “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife . . . “

                “They now get from the false euphoria of worshiping the State and riding the co*k carousel.”A women’s time to do so doesn’t last very long. One of the reasons they’re pissed. The State won’t be there to hold their hand with love and kindness when they get old and commence to fall apart. And as for the Co*k carousel, face it, gals. That gives out real quick. If you keep to that path, first you’re young and desirable, sticking to the hunt you then become a Cougar, soon after that you’re just ridden hard and put away wet, and after that no more guys and you’re turning into a hag and a lush. Unless you have a million bucks to keep the cosmetic surgery going. And after a certain bit of time on that path, you’re just plain disgusting and Old Scratch is showing up at the end of the driveway. This is the Gollum effect on aging. Women can age nicely if they don’t fight reality. Men look much more distinguished and attractive over 50. Yahoo! Life ain’t fair. Why fight it!

            I watch the YouTube, and every other ad lately is some woman past her childbearing years worrying about abortion or Trump bad because convicted, Kamala shares our community’s values. It’s a woman’s world, and it’s hysterical, failing, careening from one daily crisis to the next. Covid was a plague, Putin is Hitler, Trump is Orange Hitler, etc.Biased, but I like being a man, prefer being a man. It’s peaceful and orderly by comparison, even if you have to fight sometimes. This is the hell women live through, hence the perennial wisdom of being led by men.PS guys, you already let the bitch have everything. You’re hanging around for scraps. That ain’t much to lose.

                    Around the turn of the century there was a PUA fad on TV. Tucker Max did a show, the guy in the silly pimp hat had a series for years, “manosphere” names we know were judge-panelist-commentators on dating and reality shows, etc.I didn’t watch any of it but it was popular with women I knew and had a strong Freudian (actual Freud) effect on them. They started wondering aloud about their own decision-making, their susceptibility to manipulation,Why do we fall for obvious crap from obvious creeps?, asking men iftheyknow this stuff and keep it secret, etc. I never met a man who readThe Gamebut I saw it on a few girls’ shelves.As seen on TV.Corporations don’t have economic motives. Those shows were huge hits with The Demo™—and all canceled at once à la the “Rural Purge.” Their crime? Cultivating a female interest in reality (and maybe getting a few dorks laid).

                    Something i’ve noticed thru out my years (and this is some women, not all women, they like to deflect with that comment) is when you get a woman who is complaining about something stupid she did, if you react to her like her dad would, tell her its her own damn fault and she needs to do this or that and stop making stupid decisions……. you’ll get a text later that night about how you were mean to her, but really she wants more.

                    I really wonder sometimes if women and their hysteria roller coaster are experiencing a rush and then flush of various hormones that has a similar effect and consequence as being addicted to opiates or stimulants. Are Western womyn just junkies literally hooked on their own supply, doomed to an endless cycle of chemically (and politically) induced ecstasy and despair? We’ll never know of course because the “human sciences” are now like 99% womyn and cucked men so no one will ever look into it.

                    Right? Trump ads are almost always skippable, Harris ads I’m not sure, but it seems like 50/50 or so. Kind of expect that, but the gynocentrism really sticks out! Even Trump ads don’t seem targeted at bros. It’s the women’s election, God help us.

                    From speaking to people and skimming thousands of online comments, it seems tons of White men would love to have their own piece of land and get out of the cityrat race.  Their wives?  Not so much.  Men need to become the heads of their own families before they can even think about wider social issues.  And they need to be a lot more careful about whom they marry.

Bingo.  I get lambasted whenever I say such.  There are plenty of good women around, but not necessarily the hotties you attempt to meet in bars.

                Funny thing, but I’ve been getting ads for make up for black women.  The one ad has a woman who is as black as coal talking about lipstick.
I cannot wait until my adblocker is updated.

            I’ve said this before, but every single situation at work that created some sort of drama was caused by a woman.  My wife works on a team of all females and she is constantly telling me how she can’t stand it because they are constantly causing some sort of ruckus.  They have to complain about something incessantly, whether it is real or not.  I told a shitlib acquaintance of mine once that women shouldn’t be allowed to vote or be in the boardroom.  Her entire head got as red as a tomato and she went into a raging tirade.  I loved every second of it since it proved my point entirely.  Not to mention, I love seeing them angry and unhinged.  They are miserable people who hate themselves and I wish them nothing but the worst that this life could ever offer.

While I didn’t personally witness this, a very dude-ish friend of mine was once the only man at a female-led company. He called it the “hen house.”
He tells me that there was once a meeting over someone’s use of “passive-aggresive font choice” in an email.

            One of the biggest surprises of my life has been how fundamentally selfish most (not all) women are. I don’t think feminism changed female nature, it just revealed it. Even my own mother, who was a traditional stay at home mom, regrets that choice. She wishes that she’d been a girl-boss.The only urge that is stronger in most women than their selfishness is their desire to be accepted by the winning team of men (the race of the winning team does not matter to most women).Men’s only choices: insufferable girl-bosses or women who are told that if they want to join the winning team then they must suppress their selfishness and be mothers.

        Yes. The ruling class, the media, the academy, and even business have become completely feminized. (There are still plenty of cold, steely-eyed capitalists grinding x-number of widgets per out out of the workers for y-profit, but that has all been offshored to China and Mexico and Vietnam where the coolie labor is not unionized or give any pushback for their $2 wages and 14-hour days).I found this out over 20 years ago in the academy. Upon defending my dissertation, I accepted a job at a very large community college with 30,000 students. I grew up in a blue-collar household and had a very objective, task-oriented approach. I needed employment, period, so I took what was there. (Plus, at the time I believed that community colleges offered the same gen-ed courses as a baccalaureate school without any frills or fraternities or beer pong games. That was perhaps never entirely true but it was truer then than it is now).Anyway, I stupidly thought that my job was to teach student a discrete body of knowledge and that a junior college would be honored to have somebody with my credentials. Boy, was I ever wrong. It turned out that the place was a giant kaffee klatsch of gossipy left-wing women, virtually all of whom were unqualified or underqualified. My department chair was a micromanaging Karen with only an M.A. The VP for Academic Affairs for the entire institution didn’t have a doctorate, but she was, by God, the “first woman” in the position.I saw the place hire and give tenure to professors who were utterly incompetent and hated by students but they checked the right boxes for “feelz.”Needless to say I did not last long, they threw me out post-haste.Several years after I was defenestrated and enrollment had dropped by a third, the faculty voted no-confidence in the college’s first female president… she decamped for an institution three times bigger with a proportionately bigger paycheck.You are now going to see this on the national level, where they are trying to kill the guy with actual accomplishments and install the first Bimbo of Color in the White House…

            Your experience with [cough] higher education called to mind a old story which isn’t well known in this gruesome civilization.During the teaching career of Siddhattha Gotama, he was beset with a request by a woman, one of his father’s wives, to admit women into the order of mendicant beggars. Three times she, the woman who had raised Gotama after his mother died, pleaded her case. Three times he refused, after which he departed the area where this interaction occured.She organized a bunch of women who followed Gotama to the new place where he’d taken up residence. Some time after her arrival, this woman, with feet swollen and her body covered by dust, began crying nearby. Gotama’s personal attendant, Ananda, learned of her cause and so approached Gotama to describe the woman’s condition and sadness. Ananda requested three times that women be admitted to the order. Three more times Gotama refused.Ananda next employed a new approach. Basically he crossexamined Gotama until the latter conceded that some women were in fact capable of leading the holy life and attaining unbinding, awakening, and the deathless. Ananda also laid a guilt trip on Gotama about the woman having nursed and cared for him in his youth.Gotama relented, provided that the woman accept eight rules, one of which included the preeminence of all male renunciants over females. Another rule forbade the females to rebuke or abuse any of the males. The woman accepted and received higher ordination thereby. This not the end of the story, though.Gotama realized that there would be adverse consequences of admitting women. Had they not received permission, he said, the doctrine and discipline would have endured long and the “Sublime Dhamma” (quoting an author named Nārada) would have survived for thousands of years. Yet because women entered the homeless state, the holy life would not last long and the Sublime Dhamma would remain for just 500 years. (It seems to follow that what’s known today is partly inauthentic.)“Just as, Ananda, houses in which there are many women and but few men are easily violated by burglars, even so, under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women are permitted to renounce the world and enter the homeless state, that Holy Life will not last long. And just as a man would in anticipation build an embankment to a great reservoir beyond which the water should not overpass, even so have I in anticipation laid down these eight Chief Rules for the Bhikkhunis [female beggars] not to be transgressed throughout their lives.”

            The only reason broadcasting corporations can get away with disseminating such vile perversions is because the collective gag reflex has been excised. Whereas in the past extreme disgust caused us to raise hell, now we just stare ahead with glassy eyes and slack jaws.

                    Mass trauma–that’s a pretty good way to describe the onslaught of propaganda and indoctrination we’ve been receiving for the last half century or so. And it’s succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of its creators, no doubt.

            I had enjoyedreading crappy but entertaining fiction (TEOTWAWKI, time travel, espionage, etc.) as escapism.  Invariably now, even with previously reliable authors, I encounter “x” and his husband, or “y” the magic black nuclear physicist, within the first 25 pages.  Amazon has banned me from writing what I thought were carefully worded   reviews of such books.  Most of my physical books (those we didn’t sell prior to moving ) are still in boxes at another location because our cabin lacks the space.There is nothing they will not pervert or destroy.  Those who think they can avoid choosing a side by retreating to comic books, video games, knitting, or any other past time will ultimately learn the hard way.  And by avoiding choosing, they make their allegiances clear.

                Saw this today and fits with your comment…
the uprising went unresisted, to a man – even as those men and soldiers saw what was coming. And yet they did not respond accordingly. Terror has that effect. By the time it’s felt, it’s too late…Every man always has handy a dozen glib little reasons why he is right not to sacrifice himself.

        Agreed, however with Israel it appears that the blowing up of comms, including radios, is a prelude to invasion. So that’s practical.Indeed, the entire reaction of Israel has been a divide between those who are practical and those who care about looking good. If you believe reports, Bibi has had both increased protests (those who care about looking good) AND popularity, as many and perhaps most Israelis see a “War to the death” with Hamas and Hezbollah. That after Oct 7 the old ways of pretend strikes and pretend retaliation are simply not possible. The size and scope of Oct 7 was something that Hamas did not anticipate. Their model was that of course the Israelis would continue to care about looking good. Instead they view the conflict with both semi-state actors as one that can only end with themselves dead or their enemies.This is the same mistake the neocons are making with Russia btw. That of course Putin will simply do the same old things no matter what because he will care more about looking good than survival. This is due to lack of competition and fear that among elites that particularly the early Cold War induced. The elites had to provide a good living for ordinary people to ward off the appeal of communism for those looking to move up in status and wealth. Two cars and a yearly two week vacation were a powerful argument against Communism. They understood adversaries fears as they had them themselves.The end of history seems to have left elites both over-confident and incompetent. Sort of like a DEI hire.OT: it would appear the main motivation for Diddy’s arrest is that he has video of Obama engaging in non-straight activities if you catch my drift.

        With respect to the pager caper by Israel, the law of unintended consequences applies. We’ve all been in a fight or two in our lives. If its a standup affair and you exchange a few punches, that’s an honorable exercise no matter who wins or loses. But if the other guy kicks you in the nuts, then its game on and someone’s going to the hospital. That is the fate that awaits the IDF if they invade Lebanon. Its going to be ugly, as it should when fighting an despicable asshole. We The People are being kicked in the nuts. When the rubber band snaps, we will welcome the ugly with an unbridled enthusiasm.

        Kind of anecdotal, but my wife occasionally watches America’s Got Talent.  I’m usually in another room as I can’t stand that kind of crap anymore.  Anyway, if I (unfortunately) tune into the sound, all I hear are girls and women screaming and cheering, non-stop.  And in our enlightenment, we’ve allowed these types into positions of power and influence throughout society.  When you think about it, it’s no wonder we’re at the current sad pass – and likely to get sadder.  The question is will we ever get that genie back in the bottle…

            I usually think of this dynamic in the sense of legions of women screaming their heads off to The Beatles or Elvis. There is no corollary for men behaving this way. The closest you can get is him cheering for his sportsball team, which fails as a comparison, since it lacks the sexual aspect (which is the primary aspect of the woman’s behavior here), and also he only cheers for them when they do well, otherwise he boos or is silent. Whereas they have wet panties regardless. I’ve heard a reliable report of women peeing themselves in excitement at a James Brown concert. This doesn’t happen with men. Anyhow, it’s been decided that they should rule over us.

            Never say what you are willing to pay. If you have a job you think is worth $25, and someone says he’ll do it for $15, he’s not worth that. End the interview as quickly and with as little acrimony as possible.
If he says $35, he’s probably worth $20 or $45+. Those are the guys you need to interview further to figure out which. “That’s more than this job is worth. What extra do you bring to the table? What kind of projects can you add value to?”
That’s how you hire an A.

        “Harris, on the other hand, talks about her plan in soft, intangible terms. What matters to her, and what she thinks matters to you, is that shesharesyour values as a middle-class person.”This is patently vacuous bullshit on her part. She’s an apparatchik of the deep state, just like those p.o.s. Biden and Hillary. Not one of them had or has a domestic program worth the name so of course what they say has to be couched in vague and woolly words that evaporate into nothingness on close scrutiny. Harris is Biden 2.0 — just more endless wars and try to maintain the oligarchic status quo domestically. We all know this but a recent piece by Patrick Lawrence at the Unz site provides the sordid details:https://www.unz.com/article/the-war-party-makes-its-plans/“What we are seeing is an orientalization of the culture. Saving face and losing face are things that we associate with East Asian societies. An important person is found to have failed in his duties, so in order to avoid losing face and shaming his family and associates, he kills himself in a ritualized fashion.”I don’t know how far this comparison extends. Japanese seppuku is a painful way to inflict death on yourself. I haven’t seen any Western politician or general do this recently. They seem to be a bunch of craven jackasses who don’t even fight in the wars of choice they initiate, let alone commit ritual suicide. US military policy since 2001 has been one fiasco after another but no-one has even admitted it, let alone been held accountable, let alone committed suicide. When that rabid dog John Bolton was asked about the Iraq fiasco, he replied breezily, “Well, it seemed a good call at the time.” On the other hand, those who bring the details of these fiascos to light are hounded to the ends of the earth. There is no honor or shame among the Western “leadership” at all.“Probably the biggest fact, however, is the ruling class of the American empire has not had to worry about the duties of a ruling class for a long time.”I think Ken Wark pointed out that this is the most under-performing ruling elite in the history of the world. These bums have no skin of their own in the game.

            No analogy is perfect. That is never the point of an analogy. The ritualized suicide in the modern West is the groveling apology, followed by banishment and then a slow rehabilitation, if the person shows sufficient contrition.

                Reminds me of C.S. Lewis’s book “The Abolition of Man”, where he critiques modern education and its impact on human morality. The exact quote is:
“We make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.”
Holds as true today as then.

            The most terrifying aspect of that Unz link is that the CIA director William Burns is among those claiming that “Putin is bluffing” about responding in kind to a NATO attack directly on Russia. I’ve long thought these deluded clowns would bumble into nuclear war and that has become a probability now.

                    A month’s delay is starting a nuclear war is not reassuring in the least. It is almost a certitude that an initial strike, likely on Ukraine, is being explored (probably hypersonics initially) and prepared now.

                    Here’s the sticking point: the invasion has proven disastrous in every way for Ukraine. Their reserves, both men and material, are severely depleted even as their ‘Eastern Front’ is collapsing. Putin’s personal popularity has dropped marginally (by 2 iirc) from some (by American standards) ridiculously high number that no American president has EVER achieved. Also note that the the decrease in satisfaction is amplification of wishing he would intensify the war. The neoliberal traitors substantially left Russia in 2022. There is no evidence that there is some growing signal of “let’s surrender”.Sure, it makes Putin look bad to low-info Western audiences, but he doesn’t care about that at all, because the opinions of foreign clown trash have zero influence on the only contest that matters: socially cooperative killing until demilitarization and deNazification are achieved. The PR gains might warrant a sentence in a history book, which will be written in Russian, and read by children living inside Russian Federation territory that used to belong to the International Jew colony called ‘Ukraine’. [Your people on your people’s land with your men guarding your borders] is the only thing that matters.

        Now they care about how “marginalized groups” are feeling about their social status. That’s a great way to describe it. That really seems to be the only thing that matters to the regime.Ironically, the opposite is happening as the “minority” numbers are going up. I’m observing that non-whites are increasingly failing to behave normally around white people in the professional world. They are extremely fake and awkward and just not fun to be around. It’s either that or they act like knockoffs of ghetto African American culture.It seems like the woke propaganda has left them permanently second guessing themselves, self aware, highlighted their sense of inferiority, and made them hyper paranoid of any perceived racism / slight against them.I also think the number of white people is just too low to meaningfully assimilate anyone now. Mass immigration is a disaster and those born in the West are somehow turning out to be *less* assimilated than their parents.

            Regarding your 2nd to last point, all of these groups have “point people” – for lack of a better term – that give them a basic ground work of what Whites cannot get away with in most settings.two years ago I was attempting to get some paperwork at the local sheriff’s office civil division and there was a hispanic couple on line in front of me trying to tell the deputy that served them papers for an execution, that he was wrong in doing so. As I watched them, I noticed that the female was attempting to goad the deputy, while the male was discretely filming everything with his phone. At one point another deputy – a hispanic – stepped in in an attempt to mediate the situation. The female then tried the same crap with him and got even angrier. At one point they both stormed out and once I was up I asked the two of them what that was all about and the first deputy explained to me that they got thrown out of an apartment due to the fact that they basically destroyed it. The landlord sued for damages and won, the reason why the couple was there in the first place was because the local hispanic legal foundation told them that they wouldn’t have to pay a dime and they could countersue the landlord on the grounds that she has a bias against latinos.Don’t ask me how they would accomplish that, but we live in an age of insanity, so who knows. The hispanic deputy remarked that the female became so enraged because he wouldn’t side with her and help her out.

        Z today: Put women in charge and it’s all about feelings and emotions.i would argue about shaming just now becoming a thing. In the past, as the old joke goes, the worst thing to happen to a male politician was “to be caught in bed 🛌 with a dead woman or a live boy”. Men of power who were caught with their pants down (quite literally) were expected to resign in shame.Now? They flaunt their degeneracy. Let that freak flag 🌈 fly eh? I suppose it’s a legacy of one sex that doesn’t want to be judged on how many sexual partners they’ve had taking over.

            Joke indeed.Chappaquiddick’s dead girl (caught with) was before most of us were born. It improved Kennedy’s image with women, as any actual wise man would predict.* The Senator for life could easily have been president—for life, if they wanted. The deciders were, even then, too media-addled to know it. “Dead girl” is a problemin stories,the land of invented obstacles. In real life, royalty is (indistinguishable from, except in extremis) total freedom.Current_year is older than we think. Most of it is a lot older than 1969.*The known facts of the case best fit this crime: As prelude to or during rape, Kennedy beat her so badly he thought she was dead. Maybe he’d never punched a girl before and didn’t know what one hit can do. He staged an accident for the cops to say she died in—and she actually died in it. He saw it happen, her face squashed against the window, and panicked. It took him all night to come to terms with what his lawyers had to explain again and again to him was an unlikely success.The collective female unconscious deduced this and loved him for it, forever.

        A good example of this infantilization of politics came in the last debate; one of the mods asked Trump, “Do you want the Ukraine to win the war?” like it was the Jets/Chiefs game.  No consideration of what victory looks like, what the Russian goals are, what can be negotiated, what can be enforced just “do you want the approved narrative good guys to win because the other guys are bad?”  Jesus Christ.

        Notice that no one ever tries to explain exactly what they mean by “share your values” or describe the actual values.
That’s because they all know what she means. Their “values” are just the unrestricted ability to murder their own children in utero. That is the only issue that matters to Harris supporters, and it is extremely popular among women voters.
Removing women’s “rights” fixes this.

            Actually, her “values” are the whole panoply of Leftist views revolving around the adoration of negroes, perverts and to a lesser extent women, combined with the abomination of the Blue-Eyed Ice Devil.

        Excellent, Z.Along with the feminization of the ruling class has come the infantilization of politics.The question, unanswered here or anywhere else I read, is “why?” My hunch is abundance. Some point to the Rat Utopia experiment, but a reversion to infantilism was not the primary problem that was identified in the study. Feminization certainly became a problem among the rats. Does feminization lead to infantilization? Maybe.If abundance is indeed the reason and is fleeting, and it almost certainly will not be sustained, masculinity and adulthood will be reasserted in dramatic fashion when it goes away. The Ruling Class cannot have the people they desire over the long term unless that population is feminine and childish and placated. Mass migration, neutered men and all the other half-assed insurance policies ultimately will fail in that regard because pliability is finite. As you frequently point out, the “who” that reasserts itself is what matters, and the ultimate goal must be that it is our people who do so. That raises the question of “how,” and the answer starts with survival.Again, great piece.

            Abundance has indeed allowed people to live carelessly.  I know.  I have drifted along carelessly for most all my life and things have worked out just swell.  I’ve made decisions and choices that would be unthinkable in times of scarcity, because I knew there was enough opportunity and options that something good would turn up.
No generation before the boomers ever had such plenty.

                How very true. I’ve got a collection of 20 nice wrist watches, for crying out loud. If one ignores the importance of aesthetics, nothing could be more frivolous. But in times of uncertainty and scarcity, frivolity becomes gross irresponsibility. At least I’m not guilty of that.

                        Appreciate it. However, I don’t own a Rolly, or even an Omega or Grand Seiko. I’ve got an odd yen for obscurity and individuality, and my collection reflects that. Still, if need be, I could sell the collection and recoup a good deal of the money spent.

        Wellness and Safety and Inclusion and Belonging … … Then there is the most evil and demonic one of them all – Psychological/Emotional Safety. As if a person has so forfeited their agency over their own mind and emotional center that StateMother must intervene anywhere and everywhere to protect someone who is totally defenseless. How sick is this society that so many are so sick that they embrace this state of being and the State that wants you to live in it?As for the spouting of these words, it is all performative. It is just a performance for the wicked to act like they are moral and for vacuous strivers to degrade themselves in order to keep what they have or get more. For the consciously evil it is an incantation used to assume total and absolute power.In the end it is demonic. It is interesting to see Bosch and a lot of the Dutch and Flemish depictions of demons in their paintings.In the end we are confronting demonic evil. The final battle has arrived. Dumping masses of biomass into your city or town or village is the final stand. If Americans accept this without pushback they are finished just as their country that did not legally and physically repudiate the 50s and 60s was finished. The system has abolished all of the rules. So the pushback and I am going for a nice walk in the park.Occasionally one of our guys gets a bit of space on the Con Inc. Israel First sites.Raw Egg Nationalist got one and he has an excellent piece that cuts to the heart of the matter for Us.https://amgreatness.com/2024/09/17/emasculation-nation/Today’s post touched on feminization and infantilization. There is something to be said about institutionalized sodomy as well.I have been delving into the positive identity formation project. I have spent a fair amount of time looking into the Nordic culture. First of all its Cosmology is scientifically correct, so its morality and its mythos-reality connection is also correct.Their stance on male:male sexual practice is one of repudiation not because of, “hate”, but because of practicality. They asked themselves, “If a man is willing to get gorilla fucked by another man or suck another man’s cock, isn’t he a totally compromised man? He permits the penetration of his bodily boundaries so how will he defend our moral, legal and territorial boundaries? If he is an emissary what is to become of us if he is physically subordinating himself to those he sits across the table from or compromises our interests to get his counterpart to subordinate himself?” They also believed that the anus is how evil spirits entered the body. In rituals where they did something without clothing like a King’s funeral, they would cover their anus with a hand to keep stray, evil spirits from entering in. Can we not look at the demonic imagery we see in our libraries and colleges and story hours and say that they were wrong? In sum, this stance wasn’t a matter of morals it was a matter of practical reality.I do not ordinarily like use of lewd language, but I feel this is in order and topical. We have abandoned use of disgust and shame as practical tools used for practical ends. Is love love? Or is this just some phrase that cackling demons have invented as a cover for demonic entry by promoting and celebrating getting the shaft from another man?We don’t have to perish at the hands of their seppuku. Take the necessary steps and forge deep connections with those who refuse to accept Our disembowelment.

        The greatest Ruling Class switcheroo has been to substitute “wellness” and “values” for actual material progress. Mao with his 5-Year Plans and Stalin with his coal production quotas would have never understood this. Our grandparents would have been baffled too. Today’s collectivists have aligned societal goals around abstractions. Obviously Western living standards are declining. But it’s a threshold issue: living standards are high enough that the switcheroo works. This is the greatest paradox of our times. It will take an economic collapse to resolve it.

        Babble about values establishes the friend/enemy distinction while pretending not to, because exclusionary binaries are not nice, and therefore can only be used by those who do not share Our Values.

        “Now the point of a benefits plan is to increase employee wellness, which cannot be measured, only assessed. More importantly, there is no way to connect employer behavior to the result.”
Been there, done that.  It finally got so bad at university that I simply stated upfront in consultation discussions: “If you can’t measure it, it doesn’t exist!”
”Assessment” withoutreplicablemetric is itself subjective, hence the reason most social studies are irreproducible (see: Journal of Irreproducible Results).  😉

            If I had a nickel for every time I asked someone why something is important and they got distressed over the question, this site would be gold-plated. “Why is this measure important?” is often received like I asked to see naked pictures of them. Another question that gets me in trouble is “what do you do with this information?”

                I get it since for many people in leadership or management positions their default world view is “IMADEmy decision, why in the Hell are you questioning it?” 😒 I myself, nowhere near a leadership or management position (perhaps I am at the lowest of rungs if I am), have to fight the feeling. “Hey, we set this plan up. Why are you changing it?”But, you too have a point. Way back in college I took a systems analysis class. My professor had a poster in front of their office that said “The most effective question to ask is ‘Why?&#x27;”. The gist being, ask someone why they want something, and if they can’t make a simple, solid case for it, DON’T DO IT! A lot of “needed” items are someone’s vanity project or “bright idea”.As always Z, maximize the amount of work that DOESN’T need to be done. Then move on and plan and work to what does. 👍

                    Great Comment.  My story:  My platoon gave regular operations briefings to battalion and brigade commanders.  They were fairly canned presentations of operational tempo [we were collecting ELINT across a hostile border].  One day the battalion S-3 decides we need to add a new metric to the briefing.  It was some worthless chicken-sh*t thing that I just knew would take a mountain of work to compile each month.I explained to him the work involved and how little meaning and worth the metric would have.  He pointed at the bars on my shoulders, then grinned and tapped the oak leaves on his.That was the moment I decided to get out of the Army.   Not that I haven’t encountered the same kind of thing since, but giving a superior officer the finger is not an option in the military.[I’ve also gotten “wiser”;  I’ve learned the way to handle it is nod along, then blow the thing off.  Chances are the dope will forget he asked, and if he does remember, then say you forgot.  It beats making the troops bust their ass for some field-grade’s stupid idea.]

Probably because your professor is an academic. Outside academia, the most effective question is, “How?”
Unlike academia, in the real world, when we ask a question, we don’t know the answer to it.

            The king of objective metrics is alphabetical order. It’s all but historically arbitrary and signifies nothing, but we absolutely need it—to sort stuff.
(Without it, finding a book would depend on somebody remembering where they all are. You know what an asshole that guy is…from his depictions in fiction. Civilization is his unemployment. If he’s around, the apocalypse is winning. Look how smug he is!)
Everyone who’s done a bid in corporate knows: Management numbers are that kind of numbers.

        This stuff is fun to think about, but wrt what turns the tide, you have to keep in mind the incredible material gains from the 19th century on. We don’t know the misery that makes men change. We might be locked into increasing insanity until that happens.

            Maybe. I think it’s not so much misery as we no longer encourage things like risk taking or adventure. We actively discourage them.
The world of the past was when a man would wake up excited, not knowing what the day would hold. Now, he knows. He’s going to fill out the TPS report and use the right cover sheet.
Gawd, is there any more effective way of destroying masculinity?

        Yep. Wellness and feelings are girl things. But they are possible only after the food gets on the table.

        I get your point, but … I’m not sure the other side is completely w/o merit.  We care about themorale of guerilla fighters in purely masculine terms because moral/rage is what allows that force to continue to fight i.e., unlike a traditional army, each of those fighters can just wake up one day and decide to do something else / disappear into the generalpopulace.
Ditto, albeit to a lesser extent, wrt the political class of Moscow.  We care b/c Putin has more flexibility if the rest of the political class is firmly behind him.
