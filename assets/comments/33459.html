        Breaking the MLK myth that the regime has created is as if not more important than breaking the WWII myth. The truth needs to come out about this guy and I hope in my lifetime the holiday is repealed and the monument is torn down.The difference between Trump 47 and Trump 45 on day one is incredible and shows him and his team have learned an awful lot about how DC runs. The media was basically in a daze all day as he gave that speech and then issued those executive orders. The J6 pardons were just totally stunning, I can’t believe he went that far and I tip my hat to him for this. It is the clearest sign that his team sees the regime and the last administration as totally lawless and illegitimate and will handle it as such. Kudos to Trump.

            The most discouraging part of the MLK myth is that a lot of progress has been made in getting the truth out to normies and many of them still don’t care.  I think it will take some generational turnover as those who remember the assassination have a strong commitment to the myth.  I hope younger generations look at it and say, “this is ridiculous why are we still honoring this man.”

Because he was black man reading Jewish speeches.

                    Also a black man who was a plagiarist of the first water. Seems to be a leitmotif among negro “scholars.” Just as they have always been incapable of creating civilization, so they are unable to produce original scholarship of any consequence.

                        He also rejected many core tenets of Christianity, such as the divinity of Jesus, the virgin birth and His resurrection.
He was a controlled asset for sure. The “conservative” worship of this Marxist sexual deviant is disgusting.

                            Rejecting the divinity of Jesus makes you something other than a Christian.  But I don’t know much about his religious views. I have also never held him in any high regard.

                        Even if he hadn’t plagiarized, there’s nothing original in any of his stuff.He is perhaps best known forLetter From Birmingham Jail, which was probably ghostwritten.All it does is recite the thought of the great white people of Western Civilization — Christ, Socrates, Augustine, Aquinas, Martin Luther, Jefferson, Lincoln.Paradoxically, in trying to make the case for the Negro, he gives evidence for Negro inferiority.The entire stint in Birmingham jail was a stunt anyway — he had an army of lawyers from the moment he intentionally got arrested. He got arrested because he knew he already had enough political power behind him that nothing serious would come of it.Even if we were to allow that King was a hero to the Negro people, he was not a world-historical figure. He was a leader for ten per cent of the American population, who even under segregation were an order of magnitude better off than their African co-racialists.He has since been co-opted and mythologized by every group in the “victim” racket that had nothing whatsoever to do with the Negro issue — the feminists, the queers, the trannies, etc.

                            There needs to be a conspicuous way of doing that that won’t be construed as celebrating MLK day. Or maybe that day should be celebrated on REL’s actual birthday. I don’t know what day that is, off the top o’ my cabeza.

                                Trump said he plans to restore a lot of what was torn down after the fentanyl riots.  Including reinstating Ft Bragg.and other military base names.
until the EO’s started rolling out I thought maybe it was just bluster…

                    I was watching a documentary on his life a while ago while I was laid-up with the flu. They played one of his later speeches (which was secretly taped while with his inner congregation at one of those churches in Atlanta) and he spoke at length about how communism was “God’s answer to the white mans greed.” and how “Civil rights was only the beginning.”I was frankly surprised that they played it. When I was in HS, his birthday still wasn’t a national holiday, but I had one teacher – black female – who not only made a big deal out of his birthday, but was outraged that our parents hadn’t taught us about his and her peoples “struggles”.During this period, this teacher asked this girl Kathy who sat next to me what she knew about Dr. King and  Kathy smacking her gum said matter-of-factly, “He was a closet communist. His speeches were written by known communists. He also took part in activities I don’t think you want me to mention here.” Mrs. Dozier – our teacher – her eyes flew open with anger, but before she could say anything, Kathy said, “My dad is FBI, his supervisor who also happens to be his best friend was part of the team that was asked to follow King around, that’s how I know this. I could ask him to speak to the class if you like.” Mrs. Dozier became flustered and told her that no, that wouldn’t be necessary. Most of us snickered at her, this was in a 97% White HS.Needless to say, after class we all swarmed Kathy, asking for more info on what her father knew, specifically the stuff she refused to mention. All she would say was, “I can’t believe you guys never knew this about him.” and until she mentioned it in class that day, that was the first I had ever heard of any of that. I mentioned what had happened to my folks at the dinner table that night and all my parents said was , “That doesn’t surprise me.” my father added something about how fellow subversives and degenerates tend to congregate,

                        The deviant sexual activities were MLK were disgusting coming from a normal person, much less a supposed “man of the cloth.”
This is a bit of a long sermon, but they have all of the references to MLK and his quotes on Christian theology, communism and his sexual deviancy.

                Places like National Review have backed way off on the “MLK was a conservative just like us” nonsense they used to pedal.  Still when you show some normiecons MLK’s actual words it seems to short circuits their brains. It is like they think if the myth falls apart they think their whole idyllic childhood was some sort of lie.

                Speaking of which, MartyrMade just released the first of his podcast series on the German perspective of WWII. Apparently, it’s been a huge success with 200k downloads in the first 24 hours.
The WWII myth is collapsing and collapsing fast. Sure, the Holocaust myth will be a holdout for a long time to come, but the walls around it are coming down.

                    What’s discouraging is that Cooper’s story of WWII is so much like the one we all used to know, when people who remembered the events were still around to talk about them, and first-hand accounts were still in circulation. Cooper’s main sources are books that aren’t even old—bestsellers, mostly, that almost no one must have read, or if they did they immediately forgot what they saw there.When I was a kid I didn’t go to “good schools,” but I learned that theChurchill or Chamberlain!was propaganda and the desire for war was lopsidedly on the side of the Allies, learned in detail what happened to Dresden, etc. Now all of that is dangerous right-wing conspiracy madness—the fascist temptation! Ask any conservative.Learning doesn’t work. Or at least it doesn’t counter propaganda. Regime lies aren’tother information. They’re shows of strength, demands to submit. Second-hand repetition of regime propaganda isetiquette, a plea for social quiet.Nothing in any JFK file can change the story that what killed him was Dallas™. The “Epstein client list” (whatever that is) won’t harbor a single name we don’t already know is there.You could make it yourself right now.Etc.It doesn’t matter what we know. We’ll forget and be forgotten.

In the US;Europeans are not so worshipful of the 1933-45 Germans.Also, the idea that the painter was a victim is not necessarily the German view.
You white Americans are on the way out so your views are not  quite as important as you may think.

In the wake of “De-Nazification” brainwashing program carried out by the U.S. at the end of WWII, I’m not sure there is such a thing as a German view anymore. Just Germans acting on Jewish-American programming.

        Trump yanked the security clearances of those 51 intel officials – plus John Bolton (lol!).  The plan to release those files is clearly part of a larger strategy to hamstring these agencies.  It’s not just payback.  Trump needs them weakened.  These are just the opening salvos.Read that EO yanking the clearances.  It doesn’t just do that.  It orders the IC to report back just exactly who (including contractors, think Booz Allen) was using IC weapons to spy on Americans.  And then pull their clearances and contracts, too.Thats huge because it is a dagger at the heart of the FISA and Patriot Act domestic spying operations weaponized by Obama.The EO’s announced yesterday were a delight.  Including the border emergency one.  They did a fantastic job keeping them mostly under wraps until a few days ago.  Secrecy was clearly a part of the plan.Apparently, he also told his CoS (Wiles) to get to the bottom of the UAP stuff.  I think he’s going to rip the cover off a lot of black boxes.

            The EO drop is a stunning and most welcome surprise.
It’s great to see Trump hit the Swamp fast and hard, literally “getting there the firstest with the mostest.”
I like the symbolic EOs because they get in the Left’s head to further dispirit them. I also think they force the Left to spend inordinate amounts of time and energy on those topics.
The security clearance yank is a most welcome EO. There is no reason anyone out of active service should hold some kind of blanket, “courtesy clearance.”

                The sheer number of EO’s also diffuses the enemy’s ability to respond. If he goes basically one at a time, they can pick him off. 200? They’re going to be spending months trying to develop their lawsuit strategies.
And while they’re busy scheming, he can go to work firing government employees inclined to help the enemy.  They won’t have as many people on the inside helping them.
oh and the border one orders a defunding of NGO’s. That’s something I predicted he would do. The NGO’s launder money to the lawyers and vice versa. Cut off their money.

            “Secrecy was clearly a part of the plan.”
As was misdirection. Keep that in mind thinking of the Trump prognostications from greater than one day ago. Was Greenland just something to keep the left off-balance? I doubt we’ve seen the end of the surprises.

                Greenland was a warning to China. This is America’s hemisphere. Panama, included.
The rest of the world knows that if we buy Greenland, America will turn it into something valuable. The oil and minerals there are important. But oil drilling has been blocked by environmentalists. They use sleight of hand saying energy development is too expensive. But that’s only because of the regulations.
Trump intends to use soft power to tame China.

        Nothing about James Earl Ray’s story passes the smell test. He was a low level crook who suddenly has the brains to break out of the Missouri State Pen and avoid getting caught for two years. During this time he travels to both Canada and Mexico as well as several other U.S. cities. After the shooting, he drives to Toronto, hides out there for a month, gets on a plane to London, briefly goes to Portugal all while trying to get to Rhodesia where he thinks he will be treated as some sort of hero.  The story for how he had the money to do this is that he was selling contraband in prison.  Someone in the government had to be running him.My hope is that Trump uses this information and the RFK and JFK information to expose the deep corruption of both the FBI and CIA and finishes them.  That would be a higher skilled job than anything he pulled off in his first term.  I doubt he could do it, but it would be fun to watch him try.

            To be fair, the pardoning of the J6 people (if true and if upheld and no awful shenanigans await them) was something that surprised me.
I’m no Trump fanatic or believer in the ‘God Emperor’, but that’s a result right there. I think it pretty impressive.

                For most, J6 pardons were a deal breaker.  If he finked on that, he could kiss his Presidency and that of any future GOP candidate goodbye.  And to be honest, what does it cost him?  How does freeing unfairly prisoned people really hurt?  It was a way to gain political capital without having to spend any.  Not only that, the ridiculous Biden pardons paved the way to make it a no-brainer.

Yeah, that’s a good way of putting it. On this side of the Atlantic, I’ve been talking with friends and relatives about it, and they’re all impressed. They see it as a very good sign.
Whether other good things come our way, who knows. But God bless him for that. The “insurrection” episode was one of the most awful pieces of tyranny I’ve witnessed in my life.

        ‘Many of the conspiracy theories revolve around the fact that the intelligence community did not trust the Kennedys’LOL.  If ‘did not trust’ means ‘hated’, then ok, they didn’t trust them.Not long before they snuffed him, JFK promised to shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces.  He also appeared before the NY Press Club and reiterated, speaking about how dark and secret forces within the U.S. government were attempting to take over the nation.Which they did, promptly, while his dead body was still warm.  CRA ’64 and the Immigration Act, foisted on the public by LBJ and Team Mason, went down just as soon as the John was in the grave.  It ain’t a coincidence, folks.  Wasn’t until JFK was gone that the Civil Rights Agenda was rolled out in all its satanic glory.In the old days I wrote many essays about the JFK hit.  Whatever docs they decide to release, I guarantee that the full scope of that murder will not be revealed.  That would be far too great a blow to the psyche, and trust, of the citizenry.  It would reveal the true nature of the persons and groups that have controlled New Amerika since the mid-Sixties, and it would show the public that they were comprehensively duped.

            I agree but based just on gut and intuition and the timing, it seems the Epstein business represents the greatest immediate threat to Regime legitimacy. Ever since that scandal threatened to become public knowledge, totalitarian reaction has increased and the Regime has acted erratically and been quite crazy. There is something more there than the revelation that the intelligence services are thede factogovernment and Tel Aviv has more say-so than D.C. It has to be explosive.

                        Well, there are my own essays, most of which are 15-20 years old now, although still very topical and relevant. I hesitate to link to my pages here, as self-promotion is not respectful of our host. Z would have to give permission.‘The Devil’s Chessboard’ by David Talbot is a good place to begin inquiry about the Dulles brothers and America’s secret government.  I can’t recall how much the text addresses the ritual and occult side of the equation, however.If you wish, I will scout around and try to find some other pages with similar investigative content, assuming they exist. Your interest should be rewarded.How’s that sound?

            Personally, I think the UFO thing was a trial balloon. “Experts” have long maintained that revealing even the possibility of extraterrestrials would create an uprising, a violent uprising from Christians who couldn’t accept it as the truth. That did not happen.
Those, “you can’t handle the truth” types have been proven at least wrong, if not outright malicious. I fully expect these and other truth bombs to be dropped.

                Perhaps there were no Christian riots because we don’t believe what the gubmint says about UFOs any more than what they say about anything else. To put it another way, if I believed UFOs were piloted by Martians and AINO’s government confirmed my belief, I would cease believing UFOs were piloted by Martians forthwith.

                Real Christians — those who study Scripture and take the Father and Son very seriously indeed — have long known that the ‘aliens’ are merely demons.
The Bible makes it very clear that the ‘second heaven’ or the celestial objects we see via, e.g., Hubble, are the ‘sons of God’ or angels in phenomenal form.  It also makes clear that there was, and is ongoing, a war taking place amongst the firstborn or angelic beings.
To repeat, the culture conflicts taking place in the West are, in essence, spiritual warfare yet to be decided.

                        Scripture does not address this subject at length, though Job 38:7 is one brief referent. I came to these understandings largely via experience, not by reading somebody’s book.Michael Heiser’s ‘Angels: What the Bible Really Says About God’s Heavenly Host’ goes into detail concerning the matter of angels as stars.  (Not all of the angelic host, of course, are ’employed’ as stars.  There are innumerable Sons that do a wide variety of other things.)As to the matter of aliens as fallen angels, I’m sure a number of books have been published, most of them New Agey crapola.  I can’t think of a good scholarly study of the matter, but I will keep your request in mind and pass along books or sites if I run across them.

            Granted it was not a great way to start the day, however, his bedtime pardon of ALL of the J6 political prisoners IMMEDIATELY (“except maybe 5 or 6 who may only be commuted if they don’t deserve a pardon”) was a very nice capstone.
It remains to be seen how many members of the Bureau of Prisons who ignored/ delayed his order will be reprimanded or fired.

        His name was Michael King Jr. That’s what it says on his birth certificate. His father later changed it to Martin Luther as a way to appropriate white history. A good first start at breaking the hold this myth has over us is to start using Michael King in conversation with normies. Subtle mockery goes a long way.

        I caught the stream of Trump signing the executive orders. It is quite a hoot. It is a window into the GAE. There are a large number of womyn Latinx “reporters”, who have a very hostile disposition. Trump figuratively threw them around like rag dolls. It was interesting to see. He held a master class in how to dominate a room with poise. It was quite impressive. Sensing hostile energy, and ordering it to move to other points in the room – calling on his guard to assist. When they would speak he would show he couldn’t understand them, and then correct their pronunciation. It was all on purpose. He was making them understand what they are, aliens in our Oval Office. We need a lot more of that.The best part is when he talks about Adam Schiff. I highly recommend it. It is quite a hoot.We all saw what they did to him.There is an interesting presser from a couple of weeks ago. Trump is discussing the hostage deal. He calls up his diplomat to speak to the press, and the guy is quaking in his boots. With tremendous force Trump says several times that if he doesn’t get a deal done before he takes office hell will break loose in the Middle East. Leaving aside who rules who, Trump spoke with a force and a will and a power and a confidence that was very palpable.Let us pray that he uses that on Our behalf.To temper this we must understand that there is a tension between the economic growth and the demographics of The Great Replacement. Trump is a business man firmly burrowed in to the American zeitgeist that this is a place to do business and get rich. That is the priority. He said point blank at that EO signing that there will be a lot of legal immigration to fill the factories that are coming back on shore.So, while I want to say, Let the Mass Deportations begin, we have to understand that his disposition and he said that America cannot default. That is where we are at. The economy and never having another Great Depression is more important than the nation.Therefore, yep. What I say here every day now. America and our nation lives on through our actions in building our own schools our own towns and countrysides and our own patrimony network. The decline cannot be halted if only because destroying the nation to preserve the economy is by definition its destruction. Still, the problems are not economic as bad as those problems are. They are spiritual, and the worship of the economy over everything is a prime sign of the spiritual rot and decay.We know what we need to do over the coming days, months and years. Let’s go do it.

            Oh. Never forget. That twice Trump acknowledged the Latinx and Black vote. He never acknowledged Us.
From that standpoint, nothing has changed. We are our champions. Never forget and never rely. Trump called upon Our heritage during his speech. He made a big point to call out Common Sense. There is one critical American quality that he didn’t mention, but which is the one that is most important for us to keep alive and cultivate: SELF RELIANCE.

                This is why I was encouraged by the H1B thing that happened on Christmas. White guys spoke up and said they didn’t want this. Vivek seems to have been punished severely for declaring pajeet superiority, seems like no matter what they say Trump told him to go away after that.

        The birthright citizenship order will be stayed pretty quickly but it will set up an eventual USSC case.   That will probably be long after Trump leaves office.
Did the CIA and/or Mossad have anything to do with the JFK assassination?  Is the sky blue?   Or as AOC would say: “Do cows fart?”
As Z points out any solid evidence for most of this stuff has long since been destroyed.

            If so more evidence should be fabricated and rammed down the public’s throats to serve the greater end of building up public hostility to the alien overlords and their lick-spittle traitorous stooges. Any ‘deniers’ should have their lives destroyed, their jobs taken away, their ability to travel restricted, their bank accounts frozen etc etc.

            JFK really was the last sovereign American President. This excellent documentary presents ample evidence of Israeli involvement inbothKennedy assassinations:https://rumble.com/v4egap9-israel-and-the-assassination-of-the-kennedy-brothers.htmlDorothy Kilgallen was clearly on to something, and was murdered for her efforts. She was, I think, the only journalist to interview Jack Rubinstein:https://www.thedorothykilgallenstory.org/home.htmlNone of the above will be included in the dump, of course, but it’s beginning to percolate through the culture, and support for Israel grows thinner by the day. Its fan club nowadays is basically evangelicals, the MIC, perverts under blackmail and perverts who took the money. If the nation can face the truth about JFK, it won’t stop there.“For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.”Luke 8:17

        I was more than pleasantlyshockedby Trump’s first few hours. I have allowed myself a bit of optimism lately due to what seems to be a major sea change in generalized public attitudes and the emergence of a dissident elite (this is more important). The source of the optimism isn’t the election resultper sealthough it did further illustrate how much the public has opted out of the official post-World War II fairy tale and can wave off the propaganda that supports it. It seems Trump will be somewhat substantive as well as symbolic. All of us were correct not to expect this based on the first term. Still, in the end, the theft of the 2020 election is shaping up to be the Regime’s biggest own goal because it paved the way for what is unfolding. Two consecutive Trump terms would not have done nearly as much damage to the Regime.That aside, it would be wise to view Trump more as a Gorbachev-type figure who still wants to preserve the existing regime through reform. Recall that perestroika and glasnost, despite their marked departures from past policies, did not placate people in the end and made them further question the legitimacy of the USSR. Let’s hope that happens here eventually. The primary difference remains the United States’ relative wealth and security. Both of those are in decline, the latter on a personal basis due to crime and aliens running amok, but remain reality for most people. It is safe to bet, though, that the next economic calamity or massive police state-style action like the Covid lockdowns could lead to a full break with the Regime. The demographic disaster is not going away prior to that point, of course, and in the end will prove the true battle (this always has been the case).Somewhat as an aside, the birthright citizenship issue again indicates this change in attitudes in a way we did not expect. Outside of the idiocy birthright citizenship represents, it shows people, particularly the emerging elite, are receptive to “who” as a goal. Given the Regime has been down with who/whom for eighty years, it is positive that those on the punishment end of the stick, whites, seem aware of their predicament to some degree. It very likely may be too little, too late, but it is a huge improvement over even five years ago. And by the time this makes it to the ludicrous Supreme Court, it is not impossible Trump will have named a replacement justice or two and his EO is upheld. Sotomayor looked awfully puny yesterday.And one more tangent: it intuitively seems that the Epstein scandal more than anything else has been the cause of the Regime’s recent blatant totalitarian actions. Intelligence services have been the actual governments in the West for a long time and will do everything in their massive power to remain so. Apparently there is a limit to that power, though, and that also didn’t seem possible not so long ago. More than an interesting and ghastly indictment of the system, Epstein may reveal more corruption and fraud than even we can fathom.

        The behavior of the feds and CIA over the years really puts paid to the lie of the old saw about “the enemy of my enemy” being my friend. I don’t care for the Black Panthers or the AIM (American Indian Movement) but it’s clear from what’s being done to the dirt whites that Christopher Wray is a bigger problem than Leonard Peltier. And the old lefty assertion that Fred Hampton was murdered in his bed seems a lot more plausible now after seeing them hand out medals to the cop who murdered Ashley Babbitt.And I think domestic spying is grosser than any lurid details the alphabet boys might pick up while spying, whether it was on MLK or Trump. Powerful charismatic men typically have women on the side and I’d rather go to war with busybodies than horndogs. In the case of the FBI vis-à-vis black radicals or left-wingers, the enemy of my enemy is a much bigger enemy than my supposed main enemy. Then again, the Left is so spineless at this point I don’t even think they have any bomb throwers left. I guess the fentanyl really took the fight out of those antifa kids.

            The meth bums and prostitutes who are the public face of it don’t know it, but American antifa is a literal army—a “black” branch of the US armed services, I’d say, but people don’t like that idea, so call it the DNC Sturmabteilung or whatever—with a traditional military chain of command and a normal military level of obedience (very near total).
They’re not on our televisions right now because they were ordered not to be there.
That fact is open to interpretation. Mine is that they have nothing to do, no people’s victory to thwart.

        I haven’t seen one mention here of the biggest news of all:
TRUMP HAS SAVED THE WORLD.
He put the kibosh on the WHO and its Pandemic Protocol due to take place this May.There will be no Bird Flu Plandemic 2.0, no future pandemics, no vaxxine mandates, nor lockdowns, etc. etc. etc.
The Capstone of the entire Jewish Century was a global dictatorship superceding national sovereignty to enforce endless pandemics, epidemics, and digital passes.
Pulled out of the Paris Accord, too, which destroys the entire carbon market based asset grab and currency conversion. Man of History, indeed.

        Day 1 of the Restoration went much better than I expected, with Elon throwing romans and Vivek exiled to Ohio. Birthright EO is shockingly good, even if it must be litigated. J6 pardons have almost restored my faith in democracy. Almost.
Trump was always going to fink on someone, but it now seems possible he may fink on the right people. Jury is still out, though.

        Well, we know for certain that Lee Harvey Oswald didn’t do any shooting because he’s shown down on Dealey plaza at the time, in the clothes he was arrested in, by the actual color Zapruder film, which was suppressed at the time…Also, Kennedy was hit by several bullets from various directions…And there is indeed some doubt about James Earl Ray being the shooter of MLK…RFK’s assassination narrative is riddled by inconsistencies, and the LA police destroyed a lot of the evidence that contradicted the story about Sirhan doing it…

            I think it was someone on here that mentioned that the real JFK conspiracy is that he was accidentally killed by his own security detail.  There were too many last minute decisions that could have broke either way that would have put the kibosh on any elaborate conspiracy.

                That’s based on the Secret Service agent turning around in the Zapruder film in the front seat and facing JFK after the 1st shot and right before the fatal shot a moment later. But the film is too grainy to ever establish that the agent even had a gun in his hand.The other thing here I would suggest is to listen — if you haven’t — to a LOT of the phone calls LBJ made and took after the assassination.I’ve listened to most of them over the past 10 years. Senators, the Georgetown set, Hoover — you can listen to them all. I’ve never picked up even the slightest indication in their conversations that a government agent might’ve accidentally discharged his weapon, and the Warren Commission was needed to make sure that story didn’t get out.Finally, given the composition of the US ruling class at the time, and its worries post-assassination (as expressed in Hoover’s call with LBJ), there would’ve been no better solution than to pin it on some poor Secret Service guy and let it go at that. (No, they wouldn’t have felt badly about framing and impugning a man’s name for eternity.)

At least one member of JFK’s security detail in the car behind had skin-to-metal/plastic access to an AR-15 (there’s a photograph during the dash to the hospital ER).
Accidental discharges occasioned by a security dude bug-eyed on a bottle-rocket of surprise and adrenaline surge are an epic, epic Boo! Gotcha! of Badness.

                        Incorrect.  6.5 Carcano is a 2300-2600fps round with the 160gr pill.  Variation depends on carbine or rifle.  LHO was using the carbine with a scope.  Such catastrophic damage can be caused to the cranium with such rounds, a similar round would be the 170gr 30-30WCF round at 2300fps or so.  Such damage can be caused with magnum pistol rounds like .357mag and .44mag, too.

        Trump’s actions aren’t just Trump’s actions. They are the actions of his entire team. The Tech Bros, Miller, Vance, etc. It isn’t just Trump who has learned how you have to fight the managerial state; it’s the rising elite.
Will be interesting to see if this is the rising of a long-term opposition to the current elite and managerial class or just a one off. I suspect that it’s the former.

            The deliberate symbolism of the seating arrangements at the inauguration indicates it is organized and long term opposition. And includes some people I didn’t expect (Cook, for instance).

                    I find this new-found love for Trump by the oligarchs to be unsettling. It seems they think they can use him for their own ends, which are not in the interests of the American people (e.g., the whole H1b thing).

            I agree. The first potentially positive development has been the rise of new, alternative elite. Oligarchs fell in line with those who were at first outliers and that indicates an actual change in direction. There also has been a sea change in public opinion and although that is less significant it strengthens the hand of the rising elite.

                I suspect that the Tech Bros and political guys like Vance and Vivek began to understand that they would never get a seat at the current elite table, which is controlled by the more established elite – Wall Street, the MIC, Hollywood and, of course, the Israel/Jewish community.What’s more, they began to understand that the managerial class – which sort of works for the established elite – also would never work for them; indeed, it would work against them at times.At some point, the realized that they would need to turn over the table and make their own if they were going to be anything more than glorified lawn jockeys.

                    Yes. Relatedly, they seemed anxious/fearful that they and their wealth were somehow at risk. Regardless of motivation/sincerity, the emergence of this new elite represents the first real chance to change the current trajectory. It may turn out to be worse, although I doubt that, but it still offers some hope. I’ll take it.

                        Agree. They could sense that the old elite was letting the crazies get out of hand. The managerial class was getting more and more woke and, more importantly, anti-business and couldn’t be trusted. The old elite wasn’t reigning them in, so the new elite needed to some adults in the room.I also wonder if some in the Pentagon and intelligence agencies didn’t notice that the country was on a very bad trajectory and decided we needed some new leaders. For example, the Pentagon is very aware of how shipping much of our industrial base to China has impacted the military’s ability to fight. In addition, they’re losing white recruits.Now, personally, I don’t care, but the military does, and you only stop that trend by bringing back industry and stopping the anti-white rhetoric.

                    I think it was something more specific. Along the lines of what Andreesen said. Something to do with the Biden admin’s desire to command and control the tech industry. Although no doubt there were other factors also. Disagreements over foreign policy perhaps.

                        Yeah, definitely some of that. It was like when Zuckerberg was talking about the Biden administration telling him what to do. That was probably a big turning point.
These guys realized that the managerial class controlled them, not the other way around. Same with Musk being forced to kiss the ring by going some Holocaust camp with that twerp Shapiro.
The Tech Bros learned just who was in control and decided it was time to push back.

            The boomer is so gone. They think a political/legal enforced multiracial “country “ is the baseline of reality. Never in the history of the world has that ever existed and they STILL think the races can mix and somehow form a seamless people. It’s incredible the mind job that has been done on our people.the secret must have been that immigration dump of eastern and southern Europeans and the inability to repatriate the descendants of African slaves. This made America vulnerable to the “new democratic man” and the ability for man to remake himself apart from his nature as a member of a race

                Yet in the interest of perceiving the world accurately, we must acknowledge that the idea of treating each person as an individual is strongly inspiring to many whites. Unfortunately, it is a huge vulnerability.
I held a door open for a latina with many kids and when she and a few kids thanked me in broken English, I felt the warmth of mutual courtesy. Yet they are replacing my people.
The problem is that other races do not feel inspired to rise above tribalism, so we must understand how vulnerable we are.

                    Quite right, LTS.Common decency and manners afforded to the individual are one thing. But understanding that as group, these people are the enemy, is the key thing to not overlook.It’s odd how these two seemingly mutually exclusive things can live side-by-side. That said, nowadays I wouldn’t hold the door open for a foreigner unless I knew them. I would hold the door open for an English person instinctively.The other day I had a boiler unit serviced. The gentleman who attended me was a muslim. He was pleasant and efficient. However, after I left I remarked to my wife that we must buy white. Found another boiler engineer in the area that I will use in future.I suppose to most normal people it sounds daft. But the fact is that this is a war on many fronts that we must fight in many ways, no matter how petty they may seem.The musselman was pleasant and efficient. But I’d rather have those two qualities plus English, thanks. And that’s what it comes down to: we want the service we’re used to from the people we’re used to.Like I say (and we all know here): it’s a war with many fronts being fought daily in silent, unglamourous and often petty ways. Then again, when the musselman goes home how does he speak about England? How does he think society should be aligned? Does he feel bad that there are now around four million of his kin in myne lands?Likely not.

                        Well done.  I, too, will not hold doors for, smile at, or share  courtesy with immivaders.  There’s no need for lots of publicity or national boycotts – White people everywhere simply need to resolve to live and engage with and promote only White people.  That so few Whites will actually do this (and instead demonstrate courtesy and friendship where it is not warranted) is a very sad but telling fact about the likelihood of Whites surviving as a race.

You can be race-realist and still pursue charity towards other persons. Scripture makes it utterly clear that God detests globalism and demands nationalism.  Hello Babel, how you like me now?

                        Thinking in terms of a war actually clarifies things a lot. In a war, you may encounter an enemy soldier, perhaps as a POW, and treat him well and courteously and he may do likewise for you. That does not alter the most important fact – that his nation is at war with yours. This is what we must never forget.

                    Meanwhile, I’ve noticed that the Asians in my city, especially the Chinese, will not hold a door open for you.  For example, in my building, if a door I’m walking towards is closing and there is a Chinese walking closely in front of me, they will scamper and slip through the door as it closes rather than opening it further and allowing me to pass too.  I don’t believe it’s a germ thing either, because most of them who do this aren’t wearing masks.

                        They do the same thing at home, when completely surrounded by their own people.  It’s just not in their culture.  The Chinese call it &lt;i&gt;guanxi&lt;/i&gt; (關係), which loosely translates to “relationship”.  No&lt;i&gt;guanxi&lt;/i&gt;, no need to concern yourself with that person.

        As I await for approval, I note that the Lesbian Archbishop in DC (Episcopal) lectured Trump on showing mercy for illegal aliens, transgenders, muslims etc. who are better than White people. And more deserving of stuff than White citizens.So the wages of Christ are cuckery. No matter what Christianity was, in the past, this is what it is now, some far-left Lesbian Archbishop lecturing Trump on how evil he really is, she called for his removal in 2020 btw.Whatever religion White people adopt, eventually, as they face constant war upon them by hostile non-Whites everywhere all at once, so to speak, Christianity will not be it. It is too fatally cucked to be any use for White people. It might be a weapon for non-Whites to beat White people with. But that’s about it.This pains me as a Christian. But it is true.

            That is the Episcopal Church with furnishings from past wealth, prestige of former political greats and the pride that allows it to use Catholic vestments and liturgy while abandoning historical theology.       Maybe these functions need to be moved across town to the Catholic cathedral.  That would hurt some egos

I’m sure there is, if you know what I mean.
But is the information on the JFK and RFK assassinations going to be released without redactions? That would be amazing. In his actions Trump tends to be cautious and timid (don’t go by his hyperbole).

                The really incriminating stuff would likely have been disappeared decades ago, at least from official archives. Damning evidence if it existed would have been kept in personal data caches for poltical leverage: blackmail, extortion, etc.
Here’s an easy prediction: If any of these dumps happen, there will be little new information revealed.

                    Agree. The most incriminating stuff would have been destroyed long ago, except for certain things useful to intel as blackmail. Those would be kept in deep cover.I also expect no bombshells in the JFK file release. The truth about what went down is EXTEMELY incriminating not only to individuals and groups, but also to the U.S. as a nation from the late Forties onward.Difficult as it is to believe, the JFK hit was a ritual murder that in antiquity was termed the ‘Killing of the King’ ceremony. Essentially, it was a sacrifice to ‘the goddess of the new age’ that many powerful elite families and associations have been anticipating for centuries. The victory of feminism in the West goes much deeper than mere ideo-politics.All of the most powerful occult societies are goddess-worshipping cults. New Amerika’s attitude towards Christians likewise is not coincidental, as real Christians are servants of God the Father, and enemies of the goddess cults. Western intel is not on the side of the Father, put it that way.The occult aspects of the assassination — done in the open, in in-yo-face broad daylight — are actually far more disturbing than the politics of the matter.

        “He tried to release the JFK material in his first term, but was talked out of it for some reason…”
According to Glenn Greenwald, Senate Republicans threatened Trump during his first term that they would vote to impeach him if he established more transparency.  Presumably that included Trump’s desire to open the JFK files.

            Trump’s repeated failure to call that bluff was the biggest failing of his first term. There was never any chance of his being removed by impeachment (unless they found him with a dead girl or a live boy). Red state senators care too much about being re-elected.

        As a low 30s millennial, I just want to say what an incredible past week.  Great wins, I’m (cautiously) optimistic for the future.  I was living and working in DC around this time 4 years ago, never would’ve imagined that we’d be where we are today.  Just an incredible vibe shift.
The future does not have to be bleak – we can and will create a better one.  It’s good to take a step back and appreciate where we are now – this is the most optimistic I’ve felt since I was able to vote.

        1. “The pardoning of the J6 people without a lengthy review was a welcome surprise.”To paraphrase Reagan cabinet member Raymond J.

It is possible that the FBI has been using this knowledge to blackmail people.”DUH!3. Birthright CitizenshipI doubt this can be done by executive fiat, however since this has already gone to court, perhaps we get a ruling that whatever statute authorizes this is unconstitutional. Good.4. “Martin Lucifer K(h)oon&#x27;”Just wanted to type that. I always found it amusing. Of course he’s a fraud. He’s worshipped as a Deity by all the people we hate and they’re usually too stupid to be able to discern between substance and media fluff. After all, this was the era when people believed in TV preachers and faith healers, so why wouldn’t they believe in a race faith healer?5. JFKI vote Mossad. They wouldn’t go to these great lengths to protect anybody other than “our greatest ally”. (See Jeffrey Epstein, investment genius.) Anybody else would have been thrown under the bus a long time ago.

            Johnson was shipping weapons to Israel in the 1930s in crates marked “Texas grapefruit”, because he was deeply tied in to the post-Prohibition gangsters.Israel itself is easy to understand: it was formed by terrorist gangsters as a pirate den and mafia state.The same rules held as if Cartel today were to declare independence.Guess which anti-government subversives were shipped off to Sicily’s prison island in 1490?The Over-represented influenced that culture as well, like they did throughout the Old Testament.  The Lehi gang wanted to work with the Nazis because they thought it would help push more unwilling jews in to populate Palestine.

        Second comment today (abject apologies to all and sundry) but one account of what happened in the JFK, RFK, and MLK assassinations can be found in James Ellroy’s “American Tabloid” and “The Cold Six Thousand.” These are works of fiction but probably uncomfortably close to what really happened.

            The Cold Six Thousandis probably the last great American novel. For a book that a half million book-club moms bought, it’s incredibly weird and intense.Ellroy spent years as a meth-addicted street bum. They learn odd things, especially in Los Angeles. They’re allowed to watch the unguarded moments of the rich and famous (and police), because who are they gonna tell? He survived and had some stories.He is a boomer, though—and a Christian conservative—so his work’s core thesis is that the intelligence/etc. conspiracy against Our Democracy is motivated by racism and patriarchy. So it’s the official story, better written, with a few different actors playing the same bad guys.

        It’s going to be fun, watching the “newshounds” in the MSM trying to suppress the revelations that emerge from the release of these documents. It will be a chorus of “nah nah can’t hear you!” from an industry that once prided itself (for example) on exposures such as the Pentagon Papers.
Nothing new here, when it comes the Enemy. They hated the Venona papers too. Too much disconfirmation, which is to a shitlib what garlic is to a vampire.

        It would appear that the Oligarchs rightly fear the FBI and CIA, along with State, in taking over their business. The Twitter Files revealed that ownership and daily operations of Twitter under Jack Dorsey was not Dorsey’s, but FBI Special Agent Elvis Chan, who decided who to ban, shadow ban, what to promote, and hiring and firing internally, plus general content promotion. That made him and the FBI the effective owner of Twitter.The FBI (likely with CIA help) tried to assassinate Trump twice. They are not giving up. Various trial balloons floated by lefty sites is that the FBI/CIA/State helps the International Criminal Court create a “secret” arrest order for Trump re Soleimani, executed by British Special forces under Starmer’s direction whenever Trump lands in Europe. This and other plots are sure to come as the “Resistance” is still operating.ZH is reporting that many J6 Pardonees are simply not being released, but being held and the Prison Officials just laugh at the pardons. Unlike Biden’s pardons for convicted murderers, p3d0s, Chinese spies, etc. Trump can order their immediate release, but its an empty order. The prisons will simply not release them. Defiance of Trump is cheap and easy.This is being coordinated by of course, Barack Obama. It is comforting to think of a flock but humans are not birds. I would not say he’s an evil genius just pushing on the open door of Regime anti-White hate.Its an early test case. If the Regime can simply refuse (and it can — there is no way Trump can get the Pardonees released) then Trump is an empty suit. And there will be more open defiance. Therefore expect Oligarch action to protect Trump, as they are marked men and know it. If Barack Obama succeeds in his fifth term, it is over for them.

            As of this morning there were only about two dozen still locked up. I don’t know how many it is right this minute, but I am hearing that DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is refusing to release them, and the two dozen number, I think that more or less adds up with the number being held in the DC gulag. So I am for the moment filing that story as true.

        I was off yesterday, celebrating MLK day by calling in sick to work and watching the Inauguration with the missus.  Best MLK day EVER!So, I went back today catch up on yesterdays comments.  What a bunch of sour-pusses and complainers you all are.  Watching Trump yesterday was a thrill.  I am the first person to admit he wasn’t very good at the job the first time around, but yesterday showed a man who by his own admission “learned a lot in the last eight years”.Yesterday I was enjoying the Big Rock Candy mountain, while the rest of you were eating  oatmeal boiled in piss, apparently.

            None of the black youtubers even thought of MLK Day until white people reminded them. They were all about the Big Man, the Original Gangsta, Trump.
(And even after the white cucks’ bleating, they still didn’t give a flying fig about that fake-ass coconut. MLK Day is just another jewish holiday for white folks that they can put in front of White holy days like the Presidents’ birthdays, Christmas, and Easter.)

        ‘That is the managerial state that first took root in the post-war intelligence agencies, has been the real power in Washington. Most of what is presented to the American people has been a lie to one degree or another, because the people in charge think they know best.’
Correct.  John didn’t want the rising cryptocracy to rule the nation.  Israel didn’t take JFK out.  U.S. intel along with some professional friends did.

            Disagree, Mossad and their US version, the CIA, uses gangs all over the world…such as the contract killers in 1963.Johnson, an arch Zionist and gangster, was in too deep to ever pull out.
One year after JFK’s death Israel had Dimona and its stolen nuclear secrets in full operation, and the printing of his silver notes stopped.
It’s a gangster culture, is all, always has been since before the days of the Judge sheikhs, and will rewrite its own history to match. Slave raiders don’t change, being subversive termites defines them.

        In the spirit of AMERICA IS BACK, I’m going to sound like a Boomer uncle, but here goes: As rotten as our CIA and FBI are, I still wouldn’t want to live in the USSR or China, or Iran or Cuba. Heck I wouldn’t even want to love in modern-day Russia or the UK.We are pretty far from what those countries were/are like. Imagine living under one of those regimes, and being hassled by their FBI/CIA counterparts, AND you’re poor and live in a dreary apartment.At least with our corruption, you have a chance of living well under the corruption.

            You may be correct that one can still live materially well in the US under the corruption.  But there is one consistent thing I always notice about the Joe Shmoe immigrants here from Russia, Armenia, Iran, China and other places: their wives are HOT.  To them, a hot trad wife is normal.  They pity the US men who slave and beg to get some ugly old feminist wife.

                When trans-Atlantic travel at last became reasonably comfortable, European men began to visit the U.S., often just to see the great wonders of the natural environment.Upon returning to the Continent, they’d publish pieces or make journal entries describing the thing about America that most struck them.  They were gob smacked by how subjugated the American males were to their wives.  They considered the U.S. to be a nation dominated by women.That was many decades before the 19th Amendment even existed, and long before Total Feminism took over in the late Seventies.  Speaks volumes about what New Amerika really is, and was.

                                        Large numbers of these ‘Venus’ figurines have been unearthed, pointing strongly towards matriarchal rule in humanity’s ancient past. Most of the discoveries have been in Europe and Eurasia.Archaeologists reject this possibility because they do not unearth the expected technological artifacts along with Venus findings. But it is silly to expect the ‘soft’ (non-technological) language groups of the distant past to have hi-technology and to leave hard artifacts. Particularly given that they were Gaia or Mother worshippers who wouldn’t WANT hi-tech, even if their men could develop them.Reading J.J. Bachofen’s ‘Myth and Mother Right’ back in the Nineties really opened my eyes. Ditto for Erich Nuemann’s ‘The Great Mother’ and his ‘Origins and History of Consciousness’. All these books, highly recommended.

                        i think it’s a combination of 800 years of increasingly intense Western Romanticism, Masonic capture at elite levels (masons/luciferians are goddess-worshipping cults descended from the ancient world), daughter-princess groveling, and just the plain old ball-lessness of modern U.S. men. Who have proven so ‘gallant’ as to give away their country to collective female power.There is merit to your ‘frontier’ theory, as women were relatively scarce during the Western Frontier decades.  However, your theory would be stronger if those European men had visited only the Western frontier. In fact, they visited all parts of America including the Establishment East, which certainly was not ‘frontier’ by then.

            Ah yes, people outside of the US live in damp grey apartment buildings, eat old moldy bread, drink watered down beer (rice beer with mud water in China) and their only entertainment is crude government propaganda. Poor souls. If only the CIA rescued them!

                Heh. I just saw a youtube by a Eurogirl extolling life in China, where she now lives. Clean, friendly, fresh food, no crime. The Party only cracks down hard on anti-government subversives, and has a tight rein on ‘neoliberal’ (capitalist) corruption.
Maybe not everybody wants “Fweedom”.Maybe they just want to have a decent life.Other expats chimed in, saying places like Chengdu were spitholes until the gov came down hard on the gang landlords, same as Putin did in Russia.
We gave to Africa/Caribbean, and they are nightmares.We gave to China, and they’re the 22nd Century.

Let’s wait until the 22nd century and see about that. The history of China suggests that it can never quite get its shit together.

            You know and I know that life in modest Des Moines is infinitely better than life in modest Kazan or Yinchuan or Luton. Even if Des Moines has been overrun with migrants and shitlibs and FBI agents. The biggest problem with dissidents is they think everything is shit, when in reality we’re only in a little shit.

            Last weekend a bunch of zoomers went on a Chinese social media app and saw how Chinese were living their lives and were blown away by how clean the cities were, how advanced their technology was, how cheap and plentiful the food was, and how they could live their lives the way they wanted. They were stung to the core when Chinese people said that Americans have been fooled into thinking they are free.For all we know this was all fake and it was the CCP making stuff up to trick Americans. But it’s not like we can’t go and visit China and see for ourselves, there is no (official) Iron Curtain. I watch videos of walkthroughs in Chinese cities and they look like they are from the future and are not filled with junkie hobos yelling at people like our cities are. Now would I want to live in China, no, because I’m not Chinese and it isn’t my place and they’re not my people. But we need to shatter this Cold War era myth about the rest of the world eating watered down soup living 12 families to a room. We also need to shatter this idea that our government is so much nicer to us than their government. The fact is, our government is doing pretty much the same stuff if not more, and can be just as ruthless and nasty when it wants to be.

                    This was one of my main points in the China argument I mention above.  Negroes will alway flock to cities because they depend on white infrastructure and welfare, which they repay with destruction.  If all our cities were white, they would still be nice.

                I was just in an argument with my 22 year old son about this.  He was saying how great the Chinese cities are, and I was clinging to my old beliefs about most Chinese live in one lightbulb shacks in the middle of rice paddies.  I guess I’ll have to question my beliefs.

                    Maybe. The Chinese are experts at Potemkin villages. They have a lot of truly astounding things, yes. The high speed rail, and some of the cities, for example. But a while back someone did a Google Earth video of the areas the Chinese are not using as propaganda.
Oh, and “welding” people in their apartments was evidently a real thing during CoViD.

            “Imagine living under one of those regimes, and being hassled by their FBI/CIA counterparts, AND you’re poor…”At the height of the Cold War, we were conditioned to believe that the USSR, China, Iran, and Cuba were awful, while America was the greatest. One of the countries no longer even exists (except in boomer imaginations). Communist systems, to which a lack of consumer goods was attributed, have been abandoned in all but name. And yet, you still cannot break the conditioning. I, for one, don’t have toimaginewhat life in such a country is like. And I can tell you it’s nothing like you suppose. That’s right, comrade, the same people who’ve lied to us about everything else, have lied about that, too.Since you seem to be especially susceptible to such, however, let me give you some alternate propaganda, which—though it may not always and forever hold true—can at least help you overcome the conditioning:1. America has the worst regime of any country on Earth;2. If there is a regime that is worse, then it is probably in cohoots with our own regime;3. Other regimes called out by ours may only be guilty of refusing to collude with us;4. Even if there were a regime worse than our own somewhere on this Earth (North Korea is oft-mentioned), it could make no difference to our lives here.
