        The doll with the spear reminds me of a TV movie with Karen Black made in the 70s where an African doll comes to life and tries to kill her.

        Z, I watched the trailer on YouTube.
I don‚Äôt think üí≠ I‚Äôm supposed to laugh üòÇ at a horror movie am I?
I‚Äôve seen better film atop cold soup.
The acting was so wooden you could make a table out of it.
Some acting was so hammy I could stock a Polish deli counter.
However, I do worry you did watch the movie. Take the weekend off, sleep in. Take care of yourself buddy. üôèüèª

        This is the perfect topic &amp; time for me to share a story I‚Äôve been sitting on for a week or so now.I had a relative come to visit me. He‚Äôs a typical lefty and we were watching a movie that was standard Netflix fair. Almost entirely black cast, and I only watched it to indulge him because he asked to see it. Midway through this film he made a statement that 100% encapsulates why we are in deep shit, racially.‚ÄúSee how effortlessly cool black guys are? They just know how to talk cool, walk with a swagger, and work the room. Us White guys are just awkward and goofy by comparison.‚ÄùI‚Äôm like, speak for yourself faggot! This was an real conversation, I did not edit that statement above, its a transcription.This is a guy that probably furiously masturbates to the thought of his Asian wife being d-cked down by a missing genetic link. They are legion. I have heard other of my DC area lefty friends make other comments along these lines. This is the distilled essence of why propaganda is so amazingly effective. Most of the people who are the most susceptible to it are also, ‚Äúwell educated‚Äù which seems counterintuitive. But it is not, because they are educated in the indoctrination mills that are modern colleges. They view themselves as high-minded intellectuals but they are actually compliant sheep.The fascination with black is nothing new. This was latent in society all the way back to the 20s and 30s but it was kept on a pretty short leash, literally and figuratively. It was the jews who had anextremeobsession with blackness and there are works from the last century by jewish writers I have read expounding on this fact. They simply kicked this into overdrive once all restrictions were off in Hollyweird and they knew they had total control of the narrative.Those decades of work are now bearing fruit in a way that perhaps even they did not intend. Because genetic mud races do not distinguish between jew and white. And in point of fact, many of them are quite hostile to the tribe. So perhaps some karma will come out of it, hard to say, but the golem is definitely off the leash at this point, and I know far too many White people who have ingested this poison to the degree my relative has, they are unreachable and unsalvageable. A culling is in order.

            Can identify with that. Up to my early 40s I was a normie and my assumption was that what I saw in a movie corresponded to a pattern in reality that the authors were recording for shared use. The most I would go was to think that non-white-hetero-males were sometimes shown too perfect and nobody is perfect, but still caught in the matrix.Kind of a tangent, but somewhat related, a shower thought. Now that we know that we have a state religion that is very active, and we also realized that communism itself worked as a secular religion, it is clear to me how the religion comes wrapped into civics lessons. I had a memory of patriotic songs we were forced to sing in my Catholic school and they are basically an attempt to bond you to a state religion. This explains civnat‚Äôs resistance to race realism as this is a religion and religions have to have some dogmatic stable beliefs.Our original American vision was a religion that has been modified by heresies that are now the basic tenets taught in elementary schools. We had the old religion before the 90s but that had already a seed of ‚Äòanti-racism‚Äô in it. But we did not have the philosophical tools to see ideologies as religious doctrines. We basically need a national ‚Äúcouncil‚Äù and at least understand that we have also the right to have our religion influence how we are governed.Now we have the antibodies and the ‚Äúdoomer glasses‚Äù (I take this expression from a YouTuber that uses it to describe how today you cannot avoid seeing the propaganda and its ugliness in older and new cultural products). So everything is not doomed as we can strategize based on the reality of how religious ideas work. There will be fanatics, but as usual most people are religious indifferent and therefore we can influence things by being as stubborn as the fanatics without having the illusion that logic works and knowing we also want to install a religious view but more sane and closer to human nature.I am not personally religious but I understand we have to have some basic worldview that will be an effective religion. And our old civics are a good starting point if we upgrade them with race and gender realism and we are not ashamed of being in a religion even if you don‚Äôt believe in the old ones. That‚Äôs why I see trad-catholics, mormons, amish, as allies in the battle.

            J: ‚ÄòMost of the people who are the most susceptible to it are also, ‚Äúwell educated‚Äù which seems counterintuitive. But it is not, because they are educated in the indoctrination mills that are modern colleges.‚ÄôIt‚Äôs a profound psychological phenomenon, likely nurtured &amp; propagated for several centuries in the relative peace &amp; quiet &amp; predictable stability of Deep Inner Hajnalia.Somehow the collective Amygdalae of Deep Inner Hajnalia began to weaken through the generations, and the collective Deep Inner Hajnalian Insulae seized the opportunity to grab the upper hand on the populace.I‚Äôm pretty much at the point now where I‚Äôm identifying ‚ÄúAmygdala‚Äù with masculinity &amp; morality, versus identifying ‚ÄúInsula‚Äù with femininity &amp; amorality [where masculinity and femininity do not necessarily imply male and female].You could make a similar argument along the lines of Active Aggression [classically male] versus Passive Aggression [classically female].The too-long didn‚Äôt-read is that a society which is not ruled by moral men will quickly become a society which is ruled by lunatic women and eunuch-transvestites.===============In terms of ethnicititties here, scroll down to the very bottom of Charles Band‚Äôs Wikipedia entry [there is no ‚ÄúEarly Life‚Äù section].https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_BandCATEGORIES:&gt; American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent&gt; Jewish American writers&gt; Writers from Los Angeles&gt; 21st-century American Jews===============PS: Obligatory MOAR PURE-BLOODED ICY-BLUE-EYED WHITE BUNZ =&gt; PURE-BLOODED ICY-BLUE-EYED WHITE OVENZ!!!!!

            One should keep in mind that your statistical sample (the shitlibs who populate the Washington DC area) are not representative of the country as a whole. Indeed, the prevailing political correctness, woke, whatever the currently fashionable term is, of the affluent educated of any race in DC (or nearly any other city) is as phony as the Netflix drama you described. Granted there are some true believers who probably believe the progressie catechism. But a large fraction, perhaps the majority even, are merely play-acting. E.g. there are the stereotypical stitlib in the leafy suburb million dollar home with the ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù or ‚ÄúHate has no home here‚Äù sign in the yard, while they send the kids to a private school or [wrinkles nose] a ‚Äúgood‚Äù public school. In other words, these people mouth the party line because they know to do otherwise is social and career suicide. But the choices they make in their personal lives tell another story.On the one hand, that is ‚Äúgood‚Äù in the sense that the racial, social and political views you describe are likely skewed far to the left/big government compared to the median American. On the downside it‚Äôs bad because these people are the ones in power and thus continue to exercise outsized influence.

        This film is not that edge/niche. One thing that stands out is how Hollywood has completely abandoned White male heroes in a space of just a few years. As recently as 2015 you had ‚ÄúAvengers: Age of Ultron‚Äù which was filled with heroic White males, played by charismatic White male actors. Now, the tentpole film from the same division within Disney is a bunch of stronk, empowered girl bosses in White lesbian, black lesbian, and Muslim girl boss variations. [‚ÄòThe Marvels‚Äô]. The latter, ‚ÄúMs. Muslim‚Äù was shown for free on ABC on successive Saturday nights and fewer people watched it than a Shark Tank repeat.There are a host of White guys whose nerdy persuasion has made them pretty much ‚Äúour guys‚Äù in waiting, simply through the deliberate destruction of their heroes and promotion of the girl boss.  This is particularly true I think (if it is true) that the vast majority of White millenial males will never get married and don‚Äôt even have a girl friend. If a White dude is without a girlfriend or wife, has no expectation of either, and the culture is totally Girl Boss / Stronk Empowered POC, how are they NOT ‚Äúour guys?‚Äù Kathleen Kennedy at Lucasfilm through her destruction of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Indiana Jones for her stand ins has created more of our guys than a million Bad Orange Man or DeSantis speeches. This is because emotions matter and destruction of childhood heroes is taken as the personal insult it was meant to be.

Q: And then what happened?
A: Orange Cheeto Man Bad took a trip down an escalator in his Manhattan skyscraper, and the Council of the Sanhedrin collectively wet their depends diapers in horror &amp; dismay.
As Rush Limbaugh would have said, all the kosher fax machines lit up en masse and started sending urgent instructions upon urgent instructions upon urgent instructions to the faithful.

        There‚Äôs a plot point in ‚ÄúGhost World‚Äù of the female teenaged protagonist entering a piece of commercial Americana, Sambo-style, into her school‚Äôs art exhibition. What makes it funny is the inversion of the taboo object‚Äôs context; she took it from the personal collection of a middle-aged geek guy she‚Äôs sleeping with (dunno but the character seems like a surrogate for the creator of the comic/film) who‚Äôd given a sentimental-yet-loserly speech about aesthetic merits of this fried chicken sign (which at the art show later is not received so well). I wondered in retrospect if this was perhaps a sly commentary on the now-common Quentin Tarantino type, who only gets away with public indulgence of blaxploitation fetish thanks to a highly placed turbo-philistine‚Äôs patronage (Harvey Weinstein probably would‚Äôve enjoyed the cheesy NSDAP-inflected plots from the Puppet Masters series). The new puppet flick sounds a lot like ritualistic BDSM practice for the makers, which naturally is going to be bizarre and incoherent to a less kinky viewer.

            When Tarantino first rose to prominence, (under whoever‚Äôs patronage or for whatever reason) it wasn‚Äôt yet verboten for whites to say nigger in an ‚Äúartistic‚Äù setting. So he kind of got grandfathered in. And shitlib whites loved his movies so much, thought they were so cool and stylish, that they couldn‚Äôt bring themselves later on to cancel him. A conspiracy isn‚Äôt necessarily required to explain QT.
And to his credit, he has never once apologized

                    ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù is an interesting movie. People who think it is a revenge porn shoot-up whitey flick didn‚Äôt really see the movie.
The key point is when the Schultz character identifies himself as a ‚Äúforty-eighter‚Äù.
If you don‚Äôt know what a forty-eighter is, you won‚Äôt see the commie bastard at work attacking the American Republic.

                It‚Äôs noteworthy that the word nigger was basically never uttered onThe Sopranosdespite the bulk of the characters being portrayed as race realists.  That show began its run only a few years after Tarantino became famous.  It would seem that the absolute prohibition on it took hold during Slick Willie‚Äôs reign.

        The Puppet Master series must have got away from Band somehow. It was weirdly ‚Äúrebooted‚Äù a few years ago. The first new installment, The Littlest Reich, was written by S. Craig Zahler, suspected righty best known as a director of movies for dudes: Bone Tomahawk, Dragged Across Concrete, etc. Like those movies, Littlest Reich was a lot like its title suggested it was. Udo Kier was in it. It was funny. Critics thought they were supposed to hate it, so they mostly did.This movie sounds it might be revenge for that one. Zahler and Band are both ethnic Jews, so of course the vengeance is against stereotypical non-Jewish white people, as seen on TV. Showbiz!

        Film is the current high art. It is where dreams go to fly.If a culture is sick, its films will express that sickness. What is a sick culture? It is one that is based on UNREALISM and that manifests SIGNS OF A PARALLEL REALITY. Does our current culture fit that definition?I would argue yes. Politics trumps art in today‚Äôs film. Granted, it is a relatively narrow band of politics ‚Äî concerned with only the most vital creeds of wokeism ‚Äî but it is politics nonetheless.The movie picture Academy‚Äôs recent shift toward mandatory celebration of minorities ‚Äî in favor of actual merit ‚Äî shows that Hollywood is no longer interested in being entertaining or (moderately) smart, but is interested in paying lip service to an ideal. The frank pandering that is going on represents a surrender in principle. And it can only get worse with them. The End. (Click on my name to come read my blog.)

        Growing up as a teenager in the 1980s I was always a huge fan of the type of cheezy b-movies that guys like Charles Band made. I also loved lots of cheap paperback Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror novels.One of the many things about Current Year that really depress me is seeing just how many of those movie makers and authors have turned out to absolutely hate me and my culture.  Going back and rewatching  movies or rereading books from my youth I now notice all kinds of explicit anti-white and especially anti-rural white themes that I never noticed back in the day.

                To trot out my own cliche, it cannot be unseen. As a young Southerner back in the day, there were plenty of vile B-flicks that made me fully aware the film makers would be fine with my people‚Äôs extinction. Regional boundaries have expanded or have been eliminated altogether on the genocide map since then, but it is the same theme: they need to die.
Props the Addams Family sequel for redpilling a psych professor.

            And that‚Äôs what makes the Coen brothers films so refreshing. Not only do they give rural whites a fair shake, they express a certain affection for them. In that respect, the Coen brothers are a throwback to the Western filmmakers of the 30s thru the 60s.

        Ah, bad films‚Äîeven those with an axe to grind.  I‚Äôm actually becoming somewhat of a fan, but didn‚Äôt realize it until Netflix.  Seems they‚Äôll buy anything to load up on their offerings to the public.My current favorite, ‚ÄúJagun Jagun‚Äù is made in Africa and contains all Africans.  It has no Whites that I‚Äôve seen and therefore no discernible anti-White theme.  It‚Äôs in English as spoken there (I assume) by high caste Africans, but the English is basically ‚Äúpidgin‚Äù and therefore the movie is subtitled in real English.  üòâ   What got me watching is that the filmography is pretty good, more than I‚Äôd ever expect coming out of Africa.  The acting however is pretty bad and the staging of scenes often comical, albeit it is supposed to be an action movie depicting valiant African warriors.  Major battle scenes are conducted with perhaps two dozen actors representing both sides who fall down at the slightest touch of a sword.  This must be the same actors being filmed over and over, because after a 15 minute battle scene and dozens of deaths, an aerial shot of the field shows a couple of dozen dead laying around.To each his own I guess.

        The people who are able to see through, to justly criticize, and to feel appropriately horrified at the excesses and conceits of their own times are few in number, but they are leading indicators. Where they go, the herd eventually follows.This is not because they seize and dominate the culture like political men of action, but because their criticisms are true (or at any rate, ‚Äúless wrong‚Äù), and the truth always outs in the end. The truth outs because deviations from it are unproductive and costly to maintain. It is the same reason that fashions change. For what is a fashion other than agrotesque,that is to say a distortion of something, exaggerated in some respects and diminished in others? And what is it a distortion of? A fashion-less substance underlying all accidental modifications. This substance must exist and serve itself, for it is the ground of being, the real thing in which and by which the modifications occur. Without it there is nothing for the fashions to ‚Äúhang onto.‚ÄùThus, a particular fashion can exist only for so long as it is profitable to the substance, as long as it subserves the substance‚Äôs living activity, just like any other sort of accidental motion. A lion is a substance; that a lion should be running or reposing are accidents of that substance. A lion runs after a gazelle just so long as it has hope of eating it and has not caught it yet, after which it reposes. A lion that reposed when it needed to eat would waste its own substance and die, eliminating all accidents.Therefore fashions, being likewise accidental motions,mustchange. There is a natural movement towards the contrary when the first movement has been completed. Fashions among humans‚Äîfashions in dress, in speech, in acquaintances and political conveniences‚Äîare aimed at enhancing one‚Äôs social acumen, at dominance. And social dominance is a highly fluid and variable situation, indicating that fashions often tend to extremes and change rapidly. On the one hand, if a small coterie is able to collect all the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù means to itself, the larger remnant of society will lose interest in it and circumvent it, as happens in bubbles and manias when they violently revert. On the other hand, a change inexternalconditions can reclassify and reprioritize the tendencies that are seen as valuable, as happens when a society used to a long peace finds itself at war, and vice versa. There is no simple Hegelian tendency of reciprocal motions towards a single synthesis; rather there is the Shield of Achilles: boom and bust, war and peace, love and hate; tragedy and comedy all happening at once. What Hegel saw with his narrow, gable-ended slice through life, was simply across sectionof the Shield of Achilles.So it is that the simple people, the common, people are the most subject to the movements of fashion, because they have the greater part of their being exposed to the power of others. Having little potency or creativity of their own, they are (as it were) forced to follow what is popular. Theyarewhat is popular, but as an object rather than a subject. The great among men are popular as subjects, holding themselves the power that attracts others. And likewise the truly thoughtful and creative are least vulnerable to fashions and have the ability, greater or lesser as the case may be, to detach from them and pronounce judgment upon them.However, herein we see a certain flaw in the very nature of human existence which necessitates a pessimistic view of life ad which proves that optimism is not possible. Since the movements of history are fashions, and fashions are modifications of a substance, and all such modifications are grotesques prone to mean reversion, and since the mass of men are somewhat helpless subject to these movements, it reduces to the conclusion that the only reason there is history at all is because the great majority of men are constantly falling into some sort of error or another, and always will be.As a ‚Äúleading indicator‚Äù sort of man myself, I know that the fashion of extolling black victimology, and making social capital thereof, is about ready to fade. I know this because I am thoroughly over it and I am the plain truth in comparison with the fashionable distortion. I am not particularly angry, I am just aware of the profitlessness of the venture and I‚Äôm unwilling to further tolerate it. Many others will move to where I‚Äôm at; it‚Äôs inevitable. It will all reveal itself for the grotesque fashion it is, as the era we‚Äôre living in is revealed to be one big, poorly produced B-movie.

Agreed, but it may take a generation (if we have it). Blacks will continue to be an object of worship for the Millennials, who are emersed in this dogma and its main proponents. That demographic is about to reach its heights for influence and power. Those before that demographic and those afterwards may be repelled enough to minimize the effects.

            If you work in a leading role of influence in Madison Ave, Hollywood/TV your fatigue will matter. If not, there is nothing your ability to see truth can do to turn the tide of white erasure. The people doing this are either on the receiving end of the spoils, reveling and envy and white erasure or a self deluded zealot celebrating justice for the marginalized by marginalizing the majority.You will also need to be in charge of the school curriculum which is bent on teaching an anti-history and instilling absolute deference to AmerIndians and Blacks into white children.Otherwise, the power you can exercise is turning off the lightboxes and getting the young people in your life out of public and even private schools.

            Not just China.Many years ago My Lovely ü•∞ Mrs. and I went back to New Orleans, LA for a business trip (for her) and a vacation (for us).

She told me ‚ÄúWell, you probably can‚Äôt find them anymore since people say they‚Äôre ‚Äòracist&#x27;‚Äù.Au contraire mon amore. I scoured the tchotchke shops in the French Quarter when she was in her seminars. I looked to see who owned the store and if they were Chinese, Vietnamese, or Indian (from India, not the Mardi Gras Indians) I walked in and you bet your bottom dollar I could get any mammy figurine any size.  üëç(Not to mention some magnets with old ads or food labels on them featuring, oh, ‚Äúcolorful‚Äù interpretations of Diverse Southerners.)My Mrs. asked me where I got the figurines I bought and I told her ‚ÄúAn Asian owned store.

                I remembered off the top of my headTrilogy of Terror(when I was a kid we ALL remembered that little voodoo doll with the knife) and theTwilight Zoneepisode with ‚ÄúTalky Tina‚Äù, and then I thought ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt there a movie where a white dude, maybe a Governor, gets attacked by voodoo dolls?‚Äù and lo and behold, there it was.When you‚Äôre so schlocky you can‚Äôt even do ‚ÄúPaint by Numbers‚Äù horror, hang it up.‚ÄúLook Bart, barring a preference we‚Äôre going to put you on a wrestling picture, Wallace Beery.

                    Only a couple of Jewish movie makers could get away with depicting Jews like Fink and Lipnick.  I assume Ben Geisler was supposed to be Jewish too, given the loose-tongued manner in which he enunciated.

                        When I think of being a movie producer it‚Äôs actually this kind of schlock I think about because low budget fantasy horror is the only place you‚Äôre allowed to come close to telling the truth.I‚Äôd probably go with an Afro-futurist theme (look it up, Afro-futurism is a thing) where a Black Indiana Jones character discovers, through his research, that the Israelites were actually Black and Pharaoh was actually the founder of the Klan. He time travels back to ancient Israel (Wakanda) and brings a bunch of advanced weaponry back to the present and sets about ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù Hollywood. At this point the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù are all Black Nazis (I don‚Äôt even think we‚Äôll change the logo) and everything they say is just direct quotes from guys like Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton.

        Only tacitly related, but back in the 80s there was a story out of the local university where a black female student took exception to some tribal themed party a fraternity was having, with particular ire cast upon the phrase ‚ÄúOoga Booga‚Äù which was posted at the top of their flyer.*  In my first turn at contrarianism I began using the phrase every chance I got.*(The insanity then not being what it is today the news story then was along the lines ‚Äúget a load of this crank‚Äù.

            That sort of entry level virtue-signaling is exactly how Bret Weinstein got his start ‚Äî made the local papers at University of Pennsylvania back when he was an undergrad by making a fuss about how offensive it was that one of the fraternities hired strippers for a party.
Nobody beat him to death then, and now we reap the whirlwind.
Weinstein now plays at being part of the ‚ÄúIntellectual Dark Web‚Äù and some dumb people think he‚Äôs ‚Äúbased,‚Äù or ‚Äúreasonable,‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt end up at Evergreen State because it was a mismatch.

                Well wrt to Weinstein, his claim to fame was appearing on that campus and going about his business when the students had declared that day a ‚Äúnon-White‚Äù day.  Some sort of protest demonstration which Weinstein refused to grovel to.Subsequently, he was driven off the campus and then lost his professorship.  He then won a settlement for something akin to wrongful termination.  I‚Äôm not sure if he was terminated or they simply made life unbearable for him with the college‚Äôs implicit consent.Since then he and wife now makes his living with his podcasts and he is quite outspoken (in the correct direction) on any number of subjects we discuss here.  I‚Äôve yet to see this as a rouse.  Rather I see him more of a convert to the movement.

                I have a passing familiarity with Weinstein. He sounds an old-school Liberal. Nevertheless, that doesn‚Äôt change the facts* of the ludicrous charge of ‚Äúracism‚Äù and the ensuing witch hunt that led to his dismissal from Evergreen (at least he and wife collected $250K apiece.) Based on a skim of his Wiki bio, apparentlly he hasn‚Äôt been totally cancelled. I‚Äôm an occasional listener to his podcast. I‚Äôve noted with amusement that at times they‚Äôll tread dangerously close to some race realist theme but quickly tiptoe around it. Also they sheepishly admitted they were leaving Portland, even though they claimed they loved it. I took it as a tacit admission that Portland was cicling the drain, if even shitlibs are packing up. üòÄ*source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Weinstein

                I had wondered why we weren‚Äôt screaming ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù every time darker men around the world were wearing suits and ties. Until I realized that the answer was that we had better things to do.
It is still interesting that they do so. I respect the Arabs who stick to their traditional dress instead of adopting the white man‚Äôs. I think it would be a better world if everybody did that.
Maybe peak clown world is a black man saying whites have no culture while he wears the white man‚Äôs clothes.

                I can remember going to a paki night at the rugby club. Even the tickets said that. You had to wear shirts with pointed collar tips, shoes that had the cheap looking brass/gold toecaps and the buffet was goat Currie.This was when acid music was around and everytime they played a certain track, everyone chant dpakies, rather than acid for the chorus line.What a night that was.

                We absolutely HATE diversity.  We constantly proclaim our love of diversity. We write poems to it. We sing songs about it. We elevate it to the highest virtue.
But in reality, we absolutely hate and despise diversity.  Nobody can be different. We certainly cannot celebrate any differences.  Everyone is a dark-skinned White person.
I saw something recently about SJWs freaking out about Speedy Gonzales.  They hate him.  Turns out Mexicans are quite proud of him.  Typical.

        They‚Äôve now recycled the mumbo doll from the third clip of the old Karen Black ‚ÄúTrilogy of Terror‚Äù.  The goal is to pollute anything you could possibly have ever enjoyed.These people cannot even wobble along now without the blatant crutches from obscure works.  I don‚Äôt believe this civil war purge event thing is going to unfold as these breathing mundanities expect, because if people are pissed off enough at all their other enjoyments being  destroyed then they‚Äôre apt to find a newer enjoyment that‚Äôs conveniently near.And that‚Äôs how the cattle cars got filled up.
