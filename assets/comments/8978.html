            A couple of weeks ago I took notice of John Podesta’s greenish-gray complexion and Steve Jobslike anorexia.  Does he have AIDS?  Hope he gets a chance to confess his sins and get Last Rites b/f he goes to a very bad place.

        I know how I feel.  I’m happy.  You should be too.  We might get a few Scalias out of this.  A resemblance of freedom for the next 20 years.

        Looks like the Felon vote has finally been counted in Virginia – it just flipped from favoring Trump to in-the-bag for Hillary.

        It’s 2:40 AM CST this 9th day of November and I’ve just stepped out into my backyard and the stars in the southern sky haven’t looked so bright in many years.My hands are old and wrinkled, my eyelids and neck sag and my ears struggle to hear, but tonight my eyes are shining bright with tears of joy. From the bottom of my heart I really want to say thank you America.  Thank you.

        We owe a debt of gratitude to the alternate right-wing media. The efforts they made to pick apart their the polls and explain logically what they felt was wrong with them is what kept giving me faith. We might’ve succumbed to the disinformation of the corporate media had it not been for their efforts. We owe them our thanks.

        1980 all over again.  Sweet.  It’s going to be a rough few years.  Good that we have someone who is actually on our country’s side, for a change, guiding the ship.

        AZ has been a target state for Dems for years,particularly in Tucson. The youngfolk  there have embraced the Aztlan view of white people suppression,aided by Zack de la Roche  firing up the dreamery Hispanic kids. The further north Maricopa county area has been a conservative stronghold. Soros poured a couple mil into the race to defeat Sheriff Arpaio,hope he wasted a shitload of his filthy money…

        We voted mid morning here in KC.  Both of us voted Trump.  I also voted against all the sales tax increases.  I kept looking for the “Hell no” box for the taxes.

        Between the Mandela-effect changed spelling of the Berenstain Bears, John Mayer proving to be an excellent Jerry Garcia surrogate, the Cubs winning the Series and Trump the election, I am finally convinced we (some of us?) have vectored off onto a truly bizarre thread of the multiverse.It’s been fun following this blog all year. I generally read all the comments. I’m among the youngest readers here I’m sure.So I tend to shut up and listen but I wanted to chime in tonite because it’s the only place I’m even comfortable saying Hells Yeah! Fuck the cloud people.I know we’re still floating down the river on a shithouse door regardless but I’m looking forward to hearing what Z and the rest of you mooks have say about it.

        I vote in California, my native state, which is done more out of a sense of tradition – our family always voted – and an everburning belief that someday it will matter.  Also, you cannot in good conscience pray for an outcome if you’re not willing to walk the talk.  But I looked around at a fair-sized line at 7:30 in the AM and was immediately depressed.  They all looked like “typical Clinton supporters” (see photos of the wake at Javits Center last night) and that did not bode well for my one little vote.  Too many were lining up for hot pink provisional ballot applications at a table where there were applications in virtually every language. Bad sign.   But I pressed on, and put my little ink blots on my ballot.  For the first time I double-checked to be sure my Trump blot was indeed at #15 where it was supposed to be.  I smiled broadly at the black girl who oversaw my depositing my ballot (good karma can’t hurt) and drove home.    The waiting yesterday was hell.  When those first two states came in for Trump and all Hillz had was measly little Vermont, I was elated, but waited for the other shoe to drop.  Moments of anxiety, a tense time when it appeared Rupert Murdoch was keeping Fox from calling Pennsylvania when AP and NYT and others had called it, but finally it was over.  We stayed up through the whole bloody thing, watching the least ugly channel Fox Business News and keeping hands busy with a live tally on our iPads.    The good thing about our side of the Country:  It was only a while after midnight.  We are happy today, full of hope.  How American is that?   We strongly believe in those who braved a lot of bad stuff to support and eventually elect Donald Trump.  It’s about much more than him, but his guts have attracted the millions of gutsy among us.  That’s good.

        With an 85% turnout, the highest in American history, Trump’s victory is nothing short of a peaceful revolution. The Rust Belt, except for my Dem-infested birthplace Illinois, finally turned on their globalist masters.

        Maybe the turnout is because so many people who had stopped bothering to vote got excited about Trump.  I can’t imagine anyone with two brain cells to rub together to be excited about Clinton.

        I have decided to give up something — an offering to the gods — if Trump wins.  Any suggestions?  Would giving something up for just a year still count?  Trying to gauge how big the offering should be; would hate to over-sacrifice!

            An offering to the gods, eh?  Hmmm.  It’d have to be something pretty big, for a payoff like this.  Sex?  No, not a good idea.  The gods want us to be fruitful and multiply, after all; they might take this as an insult.  Coffee?  That would be pretty tough for me, but after a month or so, I’d probably not even notice the sacrifice at all.  Maybe swearing.

        I had some a$$hole nevertrumper send me a nastygram on Disqus about 6-8 weeks ago malindroo or something like that. He was just completely full of himself in all his nevertrumper arrogant glory, commenting on a post I had made many months ago that basically said Trump would win.  I ignored his post on my page, and decided if Trump won, I would reply.I scrolled down through weeks of old posts and simply wrote him in reply, “Hey little buddy!  How’s it goin’?”Damn that felt good.The next few weeks are going to be just batsh*t crazy I’m gonna have a ball.

Since they only have to be postmarked by today, the results will dribble in for 2-3 weeks, the better to allow King County (Seattle) to ‘discover’ the votes on anything close.Going to mail voting did ruin one of my small pleasures in life…going to the almost empty polling place in the morning on the way to work and announcing to the elderly ladies at the desk that I was here “to cancel out my wife’s vote.”  Cracked them up every time.No doubt Hillary will carry the state and we’ll certainly return our ‘fool’ senior senator (Patty Murray) for another 6 years as well.  The action is in the statewide initiatives as we have $15 minimum wage, carbon tax, and gun restriction propositions on the ballot this year.

        I’m in the Lily white NW corner of NJ standing in an hour long line to vote.  I’ve lived here 20 years and it has never taken more than 5 minutes.  Pretty sure these people aren’t turning out for Hillary.
I expect surprises.

        re: 8:45pm thoughts:1) This was supposed to be over and buried an hour or two ago.  The longer this goes, the better for Trump because it means Clinton doesn’t have some secret stash of votes about to appear out of nowhere.2) Debt free, baby.  That’s the only way to fly.  We pay cash as much as possible now.  No revolving cc.  Real freedom: no government job, basically debt free, own a small business to use as a tax shelter.  Only take what you need.3) I doubt Trump wins in VA.  It’s GovernmentLand now.4) If he hangs on in NC, OH, FL, and wins IA as expected, he only needs NH or MI and he wins (I think).  PA looks gone.  CO is gone.  Not surprised by either, CO has really grown CA-weird-lefty in the last few elections, must be the weed.  They actually put an amendment on the ballot to try and keep our constitution from becoming like CA’s with every nutbag idea showing up as mandatory in the state constitution.

        In a normal year, I’d say high turnout benefits the Democrats since most of their late voters are disproportionately idiots compared to Republicans.This is not a normal year.If the exits are to be believed, and that is a gigantic IF, Hillary is underperforming Obama and Trump is out performing McRomney.Gonna be a long night.  If your Loser friend who hates Hillary still hasn’t voted, and lives in FL NC OH MI CO NV etc, drag them to the polls.In 2012, I turned off the tv by 8pm MST.  Tonight feels different.  She will probably win, but this is no longer theory, and Trump’s national support is real, it is motivated, and it is showing up…all of which we were TOLD would not happen.

            I admit to being absolutely unsure. The exits are reporting things like “75% think the system is rigged” and “72% want to take back country from the rich and powerful.” That could mean anything. I know Clinton voters who think she is the enemy of Wall Street.

Stock futures are dropping fast, gold is spiking, she might scrape out a win, but the “establishment” Brexit alarm bells are starting to ring.

        If you want to make a quick buck now, solicit donations to smuggle Jews out of the country before the inauguration.Told my girl that, and she was all “not just Jews”, I said “duh nobody’s spending a damn dime to keep Mexicans and Somalis out of the ovens, nobody cares”.True, too. But lots of batshit crazy paranoid Jews are rolling in dough, fantasizing about the white people FINALLY proving them right after all these years.NYT saying &gt;95% Trump wins.Jesus. What a hell of a thing. Any sensible Trump supporter has to feel right now like the dog that caught the car. We dodged a cannon ball though.
