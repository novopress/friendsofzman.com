        […] It’s the Antoninus problem. Antoninus was the emperor who followed Hadrian. Everyone knows something about Hadrian, the guy who left the famous wall in Britain. No one knows anything about Antoninus because nothing interesting happened in his 23 year reign. There were no wars, great economic troubles or revolts. It was one of the most peaceful and prosperous times for the empire. But, no one one remembers him because nothing big happened. Our pols want to be remembered so they are always casting about for something big to do. Keep Reading….. […]

        It was not only that as Executive Government proliferated the authority and prestige of Congress declined; a time came when Congress realized that a fourth entity called Government was acting in a dimension of its own with a force, a freedom and a momentum beyond any control of the law-making power. Moreover, it was a thing so totally vast, so innumerable in its parts and so apparently shapeless that there was nowhere a mind able to comprehend it. That was when, in 1947, the Congress asked former President Hover to organize a commission to study it scientifically and make it intelligible.Three hundred men and women spent sixteen months exploring and charting the domain of Executive Government. Some of it was jungle, some of it was lawless, here and there were little bureaucratic monarchies that seemed to have grown up by themselves; and yet every part of it was very much alive and exercised powers of government, touching the lives of people.The full report of the Hoover Commission was never published; its bulk was too repellent.The sad fact about the work of the Hoover Commission was that the Commission had no mandate to criticize the extensions of Executive Government in principle or to suggest that any of its activities might be discontinued. The limit of its assignment was to say how they might be organized for greater efficiency. An efficient bureaucracy, although it may cost less, is of course more dangerous to liberty than a bungling bureaucracy.–Garet Garrett, 1951

        I know, I left the Bay State- my home 28 years ago and it was ratcheting downward then.  I can’t imagine what 30 or so more years of liberal excess has done there.  I followed the big dig for amusement but feel for the residents.  Hint; things are very different in the south.  I never thought I could make the transition but here with a – rebel yell.  And oh the sweet tea, barbecue and biscuits helped make the move easier.  Do miss the lobstah though.
