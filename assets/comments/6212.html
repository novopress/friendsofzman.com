        Obvious from day 1 that she and Bill intended to monetize U.S. foreign policy and cover it up along the way.  They succeeded to the tune of several hundred million dollars – and left the Middle East and Eastern Europe a disaster.
It has already been made public (but generally ignored) that she revealed Chris Stevens’ Libya travel plans and security arrangements through her personal emails.  I think we are only one link away from confirming that the well-coordinated attack and his death were a direct result of her greed and carelessness.

            The number of suspicious deaths connected to Clinton scandals and ambitions is quite extensive.  Chris Stevens only died as a result of Clinton greed.   Did Ron Brown die because he threatened to expose Clinton malfeasance?  Did JFK, Jr die because Hillary wanted the NY senate seat?  Most Clinton scandals have some deceased persons whose untimely deaths were very convenient.

        From a distance, and forgive me for my limited view, I still don’t see how Hillary can not win.It seems to me the whole system in the States, if not exactly *for* her, is certainly not *against* her. Plus, her established money and well-worked contacts can be used to make sure the upper classes are not opposing her, and the public can be bought with whatever is the soup de jour. Free iPads for everyone? Why not… it is only free money and has no real cost to the government.I am sure Trump, or maybe one of the other Republican hopefuls, can give her a good run, but in the end the weight of ‘we-had-a-black-prez-so-naturally-now-it’s-a-woman’s-turn’ will crush all in its wake.Such an idea might, by the way, have worked here but ‘that woman’ a.k.a Maggie Thatcher still boils the blood of lefties after all these years, so we won’t hurry down the distaff route too soon. However, as our socialists just love the rough-and-unpolished idea of commie-loving Corbyn as leader, Sanders might yet surprise everyone. But no, I doubt it will be servers that bring Hillary down, let alone what service Bill got in office.

            What you miss from your distance is that she is a terrible campaigner who has won a total of one election in her life – which was handed to her on a silver platter in New York.
She’s barely ahead of a cranky old-commie for the nomination and is running so far to the left, she’ll never be able to come back for the general election.  And, unlike Sanders, she has lost her mind on gun-control rhetoric which will cost her huge numbers of votes in swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

                Privately, I hope you are correct, Drake, but until the other hopefuls emerge as a viable alternative from my perspective even the woman who cannot win elections has to get it right one day.
Plus, as Stalin reportedly said it is not who casts the votes but who counts the votes that matters.
I may be a Brit but I fear for America.

                    Hillary lost to a nobody freshman Senator who openly and exclusively read from a teleprompter and whose only attribute was the crease in his pants. Always a wooden public figure, her mind, such as it is, is clearly in decline. I wish all my enemies were like her. Our true problem is that we do not have any friends.
The best outcome for the progressive is to take a break from itself. USG is protected from real change by universal suffrage. So, obviously, are you.

        Al Capone would probably be deeply offended.
I can not imagine a more despicable character in all of my half century plus on this earth than Hillary, and not to mention her husband. Those two redefined political dynastic corruption, debauchery, and hubris. They posses a unique absolutely psychopathic shamelessness.

        “…three people have four versions of the “truth” and none of them quite fit with the facts. The reason for that is the Clintons use selective honesty to blind their subordinates to the contradictions. Each member of the caper is sure he is the only one trusted enough to know the whole story.”That is the kind of thing FDR did. I reckon they took at least some of their techniques from his manipulative nature. I’ve seen many books where FDR was described as someone who, when you spoke with him, went away with the conviction that he totally agreed, and your ideas would be implemented. Similar, but not quite the same as Bill and Hillary.

        You seem to be missing one essential consideration.Like the pimp who traffics in exceptionally young boys, or “disposable” girls… despite the testimony, and evidence, there’s the potential um…embarrassment in the discovery process involving the ALSO well documented (and incompetently sanitized) “client list”.I COULD be wrong.

        I hope Trump will arrange for a million syrian refugees to move to a blue state without allowing them to move out. After a couple of years it’ll be a red state. Then Trump can move the Syrians to another blue state and so on.It’d be like a traveling circus.

        You know, this is why I’ve long maintained that a President Hillary wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world, if you take the long, long, long, long, long view — we’ll be far less likely to get into ill-considered foreign adventures with Her Griftness at the helm, since there are far easier ways to make a buck.  The non-Trump Republicans can’t wait to bomb somebody swarthy, as that is the only other play in the “conservative” playbook these days (the other being “tax breaks for donors,” of course).Hell, you could get an honest-to-God realconservativeagenda through — take as much money as the amnesty lobby has dumped into Yeb’s campaign, launder it through one of her many slush funds, and presto, you’ll get an executive order mandating concealed carry, school prayer, and NASCAR attendance.  Say what you will about banana republics, at least it’s easy to get el sleazo caudillo’s ear at any time….… and in the end, the crisis of legitimacy eight years of her shit will produce should be enough to finally get a secession convention going, which is the only real way to preserve a few shreds of the old America.

        Hillary will never be indicted; Obama commie will order his enablers in the INjustice department not to indict.The next prez may appoint 2 or 3 Supreme Court Justices, and given that the Supreme Court adheres to the Constitution the way Bernie Sanders will adhere to free markets and captialism, there is no way on earth that Ocommie will permit any indictment.Obama may hate Clintons, but he hates the USA and Republicans even more.Further, the media will run cover for Hillary. She could be video taped slitting the throat of a child, but the media will cover all of it up. They are so in to Hillary that they can see and taste her intestines.Liberal progressives rule the USA. They can do absolutely anything they choose no matter how illegal, and they will suffer no consequences. Our govt . and ruling class today is no different than Stalin’s Russia or Hitler’s Germany; the do whatever they please with full knowledge of total impunity.The ONLY way out of this is a total dismantling of the government bureaucracy; the total evisceration of ALL of the  govt. agencies, which IS the seat of power in our nation.

        I’ve been telling people that whoever (whomever?) the GOP candidate is, at the first debate vs Hillary, should begin his opening statement by looking at her right in the eyes and asking, “Hillary, why aren’t you in jail?”

        Arguing Clinton is running to be President because she’s running from the Feds isn’t merely far-fetched, it’s downright ridiculous, considering that she also tried running to be President before Obama was elected, before the private server business and it was always clear that she would run again.I also happen to think Bill can shove his cigar wherever he wants. I don’t know if it’s a good thing to do to cigars but otherwise I don’t really care. The bizarre left-wing notion that “a woman is always right when she says something against men”, by which we derive “a woman should always be believed” might make us feel some joy when we watch the Clintons being harassed by an idiotic left-wing dogma but we should fight against it, because that dogma is bad for everyone.
