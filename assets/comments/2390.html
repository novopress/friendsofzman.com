        Replace Scotland with Quebec and the story is pretty much the same. Dole – check.  Strange language habits – check.  Subterranean fertility rates – check (so much so that they have to import french speaking immigrants from Haiti and the like whilst simultaneously despising them) Oddly we, in the Rest of Canada, are never asked if we can vote to make them leave.

            One of my favorite lines I heard from Germans is that Quebec is a third world country populated by white people. The same is said of Maine, which has a lot of acadians too. Maine is a basket case economically with more people on welfare than working. As someone once told me, it is a beautiful state full of ugly people.

        The enticing prospect for many Englishmen is that not only will Scots independence finally help see the Labour party off (traditionally they get a good number of House of Commons seats from Scotland), but also offer a chance to save money by hopefully scrapping the Barnett formula (where Scotland receives more government cash per head of population than does England — money that fuels various glib Scots Nationalist spending sprees) which even the originator of it understood was an unfair system that was meant to be temporary but has since become entrenched.But most of all the English are looking forward to having an English parliament, where the West Lothian question won’t be an issue. This is where, incredibly, Scots can vote on laws affecting Blackburn in north-west England but the English cannot vote on laws affecting Blackburn, West Lothian, in Scotland.There are devolved governments for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland but all members from these regions can vote for laws affecting England. In actuality England and Wales are put together for legislation but the fact remains England as such does not have its own parliament.With the Scots gone, the English will at last have that. Whether it is a good thing for the UK to be rid of the Scots is a separate matter; although the EU has said they won’t automatically accept application from Scotland for membership there must be a fair chance that Brussels will sooner or later eagerly accept Scotland as a member — and the Scots can then lobby for English money through the EU parliament.Many think this will be a resumption of the Barnett formula by another name, but every year Scotland is on its own the rest of the UK saves money.

        It is plainly in the best interests of the English, Welsh and Northern Irishmen that Scotland separate from them. Rebuilding Hadrian’s Wall would also be a good idea.
