        The pithy posters will show up later.  I’ll just say that you have the most uncanny knack for hitting right on the things we’re all thinking and then giving them your own little twist. Nailing them.   So good!   (as they say on the foodie sites).  You’ve become a daily habit.

        I know nothing about foodies, but you’ve nailed academia, Zman.  I remember sitting through my first graduate school seminar.  I was first amused, then perturbed, then horrified, by the realization thatthey actually believe this stuff.They think we’re actually on the frontlines of The Revolution here, and we’re no-foolin’ Bringing Down Capitalism by making bored undergraduates write words like “cisgender” all over their midterms.  I remember hearing a feminist going on about how men’s supposedly superior strength is an artifact of the Patriarchy… when the campus gym was not five minutes away.  I spent the rest of the seminar trying to calculate, to the nearest gigawatt, how much energy they have to expend daily to avoid encountering reality.  It takes more advanced math than I have at my command, but it’s surely a hell of a lot.

            That trend you witnessed is especially bad in the most prestigious US law schools where every professor wants to be the coolest guy with radical theories or the femNazi with a cause.  99% of the law students all feel the need to parrot their professors, if only to get good grades but a surprising number actually believe in the nonsense preached.

        i generally agrees as to the pretentious nature of most cooking shows.  They are, however, moments worthy of your interest but, perhaps, not for the reason intended by the maker.in this regard, I highly recommend an obscure PBS program called “Modern Scandinavian Cooking”.  As I have watched the few episodes I’ve came across, I’ve often found myself wondering is the whole thing was a very deep parody of cooking shows.   To begin with, it is set in a region with possibly the worst ethnic food in the world, rivaling even the British.  The ingredients and preparations are revolting. (i.e. , One episode visited an island with no trees, yet it was famous for it’s smoked meat.  Smoked with dung. As the host noted, “That does give it a unique, pungent taste.”).  Also, quite often it looks like the host, an Englishman of course, will grimace upon tasting such treats a Icelandic scyr, a spoiled milk product (“My, that is bitter.”).  Round that all off with delicacies such as Norwegian lutefisk (dried cod marinated in lye) and you clearly have a hit on your hands.

            And “Moderation in everything….including moderation.”
I once saw her at my then supermarket in Montecito, CA, barreling into the parking lot, packed into the tiniest red car with her little husband.  She was a very large woman.  She more than filled the driver seat side of the car.  Paul Child got what was left.  A sweetly comical sight.

        The only cooking show I’ve ever watched and truly enjoyed was the original Japanese version of Iron Chef – part surreal manga and part blood sport:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z9E6WOaQiA
My favorite character is Chairman Kaga, a megalomaniacal Bond villain (if Mao was a foodie and had Prince’s fashion sense) who presides over culinary battles at his Colosseum of gastronomy, aka Kitchen Stadium.
The US version is just celebrity chefs exposed for the wankers they are.  As The Donald would say:  “Sad.”

                If you can find it, try out “MXE (Most Extreme Elimination)”, a Japanese game show with fake English narration.  Hilarious.

                Parodied years ago on The Simpsons, when they went to Japan and ended up on a sadistic game show. The host introduced the rules by telling them [insert George Takei doing mock Japanese accent], “American game shows reward knowledge. In Japan, we punish ignorance!”

        CS Lewis spoke of the sin of “delicacy” and this foodie business would fit right in.  He explained that the person who imagines themselves far too delicate or far too enlightened to eat the food before them, will make everyone around them revolve around his private preferences.  My vegan boss does this to all of us.  We cannot go out to lunch at a great burger joint unless it has vegan options. Barbeque is never an option for us.  Luckily we all like Asian food. It’s a small thing… we can each eat what we want when he’s not around, but still, it’s the assumption that we must bow to his virtue-signalling.

        Agree (mostly) on the wine comments. I like dry reds, and when people ask me advice, and they do, though I don’t know why, I tell them a good wine is one YOU like, regardless of cost or other people’s opinions. My wife likes sweet wines. Pretty much if she likes a wine, I don’t, and vice versa, though there are quite a few we both detest.As for food in our house, it usually tastes a little different then the same food in other people’s houses. A lot of it has to do with having kids. Something I discovered is that the more a food tastes like dessert, the more likely it will be eaten. Ginger, nutmeg, vanilla, and/or allspice get added to a lot of recipes.

        Food artistry seems like a first-world indulgence to me. I enjoy a tasty steak with the best of them, but generally consider food as fuel &amp; not something to spend a lot of time preparing. 5 mins a side over a hot grill = dinner.On the other hand, I thought this was a great description of how we got here:“The Left would open the debate at 10 and the Right would offer 5 and they would settle in between. That’s how we went from telling AIDS jokes to jailing Christian bakers in the blink of eye.”That’s exactly how it happened.Legislation (or is it politics?) is the art of compromise, I think someone said. Unfortunately, when all was said and done, the compromising tended to slope in only one direction.…and here we are.

        People eat in the direction they would one day like to be. Kale, sushi, quinoa (pronounced KWin-Noah) and any other gastronomic horse shit is just virtue signalling. The same as craft beer. It is a way to sound more clever than mum and dad. The great ironies are that young people are cooking lees than ever despite watching shows on TV. Why? Because they don’t have time to cook. They have an hour to watch MKR though. Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public.

        I seriously loathe the word “foodie”. So pretentious. My 9 year old daughter loves cooking shows, especially the ones with kids, like Rachel Ray Kids’ Cook-Off and Master Chef Junior. The kids on these shows range from 8-12 years old. Who knows if they’re really doing all that cooking? We laugh about the manufactured drama. I miss Julia Child; now that was a cooking show!

        “……..Food tasting, like wine tasting is mostly bullshit…….”Some time ago a university professor examined the wine testing results of competitions in California. He found, surprise, surprise, that the “best” wines in one competition would not even place near the top in subsequent competitions, even if held only a week apart.There was zero consistency of results in testing wines.A really great movie that deals with wine testing is BOTTLE SHOCK, which is based on a true story.There is no doubt that really crappy wines would be judged crap but almost anybody – even me, and I have zero wine knowledge. But above, say, 10 bucks a bottle, they all taste just fine (with the exception of Pennsylvania wines; they taste really bad).My wife buys the wine we drink and I cannot for the life of me tell the difference betwixt a 10 buck bottle vs a 25 buck bottle.

            When I was a young man just starting out, I was given some number crunching tasks that resulted in me getting invited to a company dinner with all the big shots. I guess they were feeling good about things because the boss ordered a $1500 bottle of wine. It tasted like every other wine to me, but I was a kid and just assumed I lacked the sophistication to know good wine. Later, the boss asked me how I liked the wine and I told him that he probably paid $1500 for ten dollar wine. He laughed and said, “But everyone at the table will talk about that bottle of wine like it was the greatest thing they every tasted. That’s why you spend the money.”I always liked that guy.

                I loved the little informal “wine tasting” that my then roommate-by-marriage and wine aficionado (this was the late 70s) set up for a visiting wine “expert”.   In with the paper wrapped Haut Brion and other upmarket wines was a a bottle of  red I’d picked up from a 98 cent sale bin at our wine store.
Guess which one the expert liked best?
Those were interesting times.

            Every time I see it I think it should be given a new, Southern Gothic pronunciation, something like “Kwaaaiii-nooah”.
As in, “Please pass the kwaaaiiinooah, Miss Scarlett”.

                It’s pronounced “kwin-owe-ah”. If you wanted it pronounced “keenwah” you should’ve damn well spelled it that way.

        Not to comment on the politics of it but I’ve always been a big fan of Alton Brown’s “Good Eats” because he doesn’t go nutsnutsnuts. The shows are usually about the how and whys of cooking (i.e. the science) and then the recipes show you how to cook a good dish well. I learned how to dry age steak in my fridge from that show and for that alone I will be an Alton fan.
