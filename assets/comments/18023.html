        My mother asked me recently why do people hate Jewish people and I answered that it was hard to keep liking someone who didn’t like you and held you in great contempt.

            “I don’t hate Jews, I’ve just never met one I liked” sums up my own experience. And no, I do not believe I’ve ever met anyone I liked and simply not recognized them as Jewish as, at least on a personal level, Jews – like homosexuals – seem compelled to self-identify within minutes of meeting someone.

                I disagree.  I know a handful of Jews that I really like and share similar political outlooks.  The problem is that they are outliers, which by definition, are not representative of their group.
I acknowledge that these outliers are in a tough position but I am not going to put their comfort above the mission of white advocacy.

                    Exactly.  NAxALT’s are welcome, but they’re not relevant to policy, and our interests require an apartheid policy toward Jews.  Not hostility, but restriction, separation and when necessary expulsion.  I welcome based Jews who support White identity, if anyone can find some.

            There’s a saying:  If I dislike you, that’s my problem.  If everyone dislikes you, that’s your problem.  They’re something wrong with you.  Can anti-semitism always be blamed on economic envy or religious bigotry?
There are such things as group characteristics, good and bad.  A person may be perfectly justified in disliking, looking down upon, seeking to avoid or just not wanting members of a particular group in one’s workplace, school, neighborhood or country.

                If you tell me you were kicked out of one bar, I sympathize with you and wonder what the bouncer’s problem was.
If you tell me you were kicked out of another bar, I sympathize with you for your string of bad luck.
If you tell me you were kicked out of 109 bars, I wonder when you will engage in some self-examination.

                It must be an interesting psychological state to belong to a race/religion that you must know nobody likes, even your own. I used to watch the “ Larry David Show” which was basically a take-off on secular Jewish life in LA by one their own. The sheer unlikeability of the characters was striking.

        This is where Zman parts ways with those who he deems the “antisemites” on the Dissident Right: he hopes that Jews will realize their best interests lie in the continued survival of strong Western nations and thereby renounce their double dealing and subversive ways. And I agree that thiswouldbe a desirable outcome.But (and this is an honest question) is there any evidence from the long history of Jewish-Gentile interaction that this is likely, or even possible? Have Jews managed any sustained coexistence among Gentiles in which they haven’t sought to influence the ruling classes to their own benefit, or sought to undermine the cultures and mores of the host peoples?Quite by coincidence, I was reading Leviticus 26 this morning, in which God lays out the long list of curses that will befall the Israelites if they forsake his covenant. Among them is the promise that after they are exiled and scattered among the nations, they will continually flee when none pursues, and be terrorized by the sound of a leaf. If this doesn’t describe the weird neurosis that Jews feel about innocuous gentile expressions of national pride and patriotism, I don’t know what does.

            Depends what you mean by Gentile.
They seem to have a better track record in Islamic states than in the Christian states of Europe.  A lot of different explanations have been advanced for why this is the case.

                Islam is not a twisted mutation of Christianity, as some (Goldman) has tentatively claimed.
It is a return to the true, original messianic faith of Abraham- that the God will return and reward only when each slice of this world is paid for with blood, the blood of sacrificial animals.
Those animals are not the sons of Adam- Adam’s descendant, Abraham, had two sons, and they are brothers.

                    Goldman wasn’t the first; that was Belloc, who stated that Islam is one of the seven great heresies.  And it is; Islam’s Allah is not the Christian, nor Jewish, God.

                            Stephan Molyneux is (or was, before he discovered cuckbucks) big on talking about how middle Eastern societies destroyed their mean IQ via cousin marriage.  “Judaism for Stupids” makes a degree of logical sense.  There were definitely significant Jewish populations in Mecca and Medina during Muhammad’s time.

            To their great credit, the normal men of goodwill amongst them have been fighting the unseen influence from the beginning.
They have adapted to and tried to accomodate to a possessed minority in their own population.
In their History, the good have left many illustrations of that unseen Hand, a secret guide on what to expect from a malevolent influence they could not see nor understand, nor even speak of openly.

        From the Prager piece:“One should add that nationalism is evil when it celebrates race, but that is not nationalism; it is racism.”Always funny how they run screaming at the thought that a nation has any blood ties, the most fundamental building block of any community.An interesting thought experiment is to ask someone is if a nation, let’s say Korea, decided to replace all of their children with Africans.  They would teach them the same civics, go through the same institutions, and share with them the same culture.  In fifty years, would Korea still be a Korean nation?In retrospect, this is not a thought experiment anymore, as this is essentially what many European countries are doing.

            Ben Shapiro: Twitter June 2017 (actual tweet) – “And by the way, I don’t give a good damn about the so-called “browning of America.” Color doesn’t matter. Ideology does.”Ten minutes later speaking to wife- “But thank god we don’t let any n1ggers or Arabs into Israel! Now let’s hope they will all be good little goys &amp; girls.”Rules for thee but NOT for me. This is International Jewry Playbook 101. And then they always wonder with such mystified terror why the trains start running on time. People this obtuse and arrogant can only learn through extreme measures and you needn’t look farther than the last 2000 years of the historical record to see this proven over &amp; over. When you are forcefully run out of 100s of nations it is time to look in the mirror and ask this simple question- “Is it them, or am I the asshole?” This type of introspection cannot occur in a ‘Chosen’ people who could never be wrong.

                        Yes it would be great Compsci, why don’t you run down to your local chamber of commerce and put in an application for you White Defense League to mimick the ADL. Let me know how that all goes for you… are you asleep?Of COURSE we want these things, and we are barred from them because (((they))) are so afraid of muh ovens and muh railcars.Read what I wrote- more slowly this time. Rules for THEE but not for me. They can have lobbying groups, NGOs, special interests along tribal lines, not you white man. Have you been in a coma for the last 40 years? What an odd statement you made.

                            Apex, you really need to read twice yourself before responding.  Nothing I said denigrates/contradicts  what you said.  Your thoughts are solid. That Jews have achieved such—regardless of means to obtain or retain such has nothing to do with what I said.  The result is quite similar to what we seek as well.  If successful tactics can be learned, even from an enemy, then we should learn such.

Both times, 5 radio shows, all within 10 minutes of listening, brought up The Bad Man and You Know What Happens When.

                Alzaebo, Prager is fine.  Better than most.  He is simply not all the way there, to wit, an acknowledgement of racial consciousness/differences—even existence of such.  But his moral outlook is pretty good and he’s not afraid of ruffling Leftist feathers.  He can be found repeatedly lamenting wrt to liberal, Leftist Jews and their vote against self interest (as he sees it) wrt many issues we discuss here.  But he is a Zionist, as they all are.

                    Compsci – please re-read your comment.  Prager is not fine; he’s a gatekeeper just like Shapiro, but in a different manner, more palatable to older folks.  Yes, he’s technically against the excesses of the left and has said some good things about the nature of feminism, but he filters everything through his Jewish education and faith, both of which he boasts of.  He is not merely a Zionist, he is an American in name only.  And, while I haven’t read anything of his in many years, what Chet Rollins quotes (“One should add that nationalism is evil when it celebrates race, but that is not nationalism; it is racism.”) is straight out of the Hazony playbook re the very kosher “Edmund Burke” conference.

                        3g4me.  Gatekeeper?  That moniker comes up many times here—seems such is always used to belittle someone who does not believe as you believe, but is successfully promoting his (honest) beliefs to an audience the size of which you could not hope to obtain with your beliefs and promotional efforts.
Don’t denigrate success, learn from it and step up your game.  That at least could possibly lead to inroads with the “normies”, whereas denigration/name calling leads nowhere.

                            1. Prager preaches the deception of judeo-christianity, which has facilitated the acceptance of jewish rule in goyish nations. 2. Name calling has helped get leftists in complete control of the west. They figured out the correct names to call us while we were too busy hiding behind the ‘not stooping to their level’ excuse.

        I have nothing against Jews.   However I do not want the U.S. to give them billions of dollars of direct aid and billions of dollars in military hardware every year when we are broke.  I also do not relish the thought of young American kids coming home with their legs blown off or in body bags for fighting wars for Israel that Israel will not fight for itself.While I am at it I am not enamored of  politicians, Jewish or neocon traitors, who agitate for such things.  When I see a small group with so much power and the will to use that power toward a bad end for America, I find myself wishing that the Jews would do what Benjamin Netanyahu advised them all to do.   Go back to Israel.If this makes me an anti-semite then so be it.

            “Go back to Israel.”They can’t. If all Jews were to hive off to Israel tomorrow, US foreign policy would gradually revert to normal. This would place Israel in the untenable position of having to negotiate in good faith with people they hate. Or wait until Muslims  re-absorb that part of the world back into the Dār al-Islam. Because Jews are inherently Semitic fanatics like their Muslim cousins, they would probably launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack if threatened. And that would be the end of Israel. American Jews now have a wolf by the ears…and they are not going to let go voluntarily. Whatever fate has in store for them, it will be their story and not ours. Unfortunately, gentiles are going to show up often in footnotes and in the index.

                American Jews are caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place:  A Jew may or may not consider himself White, and the lefties don’t seem to, but non-Whites consider them White.  If anything, uber Whites.  On the other hand, a growing number of White Gentiles are redpilled to the reality of a hostile Jewish elite and its power over us.  This blogpost and the ((((triple parentheses))) references are examples.  Which way they jump remains to be seen.

                        They want to be on the side of the Coalition of the Ascendent.  It’s also been pointed out that many Jews don’t like the term “Judeo-Christian” because of their hostility to Christianity.

                “This would place Israel in the untenable position of having to negotiate in good faith with people they hate.”
There are two sides to this. Muslims are on fire with hate for the Jews and are less capable of negotiating in good faith than any group on earth.

                        The Jews seem to trust each other at least, which is more than I can say for the American honkeys. That’s why they do well and the honkeys don’t. I’m surprised the dissident right honkeys can’t learn from that.

            For what it’s worth, Martin Armstrong of Armstrong Economics predicts Civil War in the mid-2020s with China achieving the status as the world’s economic powerhouse in 2032.  Armstrong predicts that no wonder who wins in 2020, the other side will not accept it.Vox Day also posted a number of posts regarding admissions by the Pentagon that we would lose a war with China and Russia.  A major military loss could precipitate a collapse of the US government followed by a breakup.I have said to a number of people that I think that we are heading for a civil war and no one disagreed.

                “No (matter) who wins in 2020, the other side will not accept it”.  Who taught us that?  Who taught us that a historical artifact, the Betsy Ross flag, could go from zero to toxic in 48 hours?  Who started this “social justice” thing, that disagreements must be laced with moral judgements, and that the moral judgement always falls in the same direction?  Who declared that people one disagrees with are deplorable reprobates, and stupid idiots?  To the extent that we are finally looking at standing up for ourselves, it’s about damn time.  Remember the old axiom, don’t pick fights, but don’t back down from them, and do whatever it takes to win the fights you get into, whatever it takes.  OK, rant over, just needed to get it out.

        I could bring myself to support Israel as the Jewish homeland, if the Jews would actually all go and live there, but they refuse to do so.  How can anyone see it as their homeland, when they don’t see it that way themselves?  To American Jews, Israel is simply an option, a Plan B, a bolt-hole, a summer house.
Frankly what Israel has turned out to be, is the nuclear-armed gangster headquarters of an international crime syndicate.

        Z describes the problem of Jewish disloyalty and then the outcome that he hopes for, which is that American Jews realize that they can “serve Israel and the Jewish people as loyal allies of their fellow Americans.”
Let that sink in.
Z’s best case outcome is that American Jews continue to value the Jewish people over the USA, but that they be more loyal to their Golem host country because it serves their interests.
If this is the best possible outcome then separation seems not just eminently reasonable but absolutely necessary.

            Beautifully put.I sincerely admire Zman’s moderate tone on this and other questions, and while I suspect that he has already consigned me to the ranks of his wearisome “antisemitic” commenters, I actually share this aspect of his temperament.But what he’s proposing here appears to have no historical analogue in European-heritage nations, and it’s entirely reasonable to ask, first, exactlyhowthis Great Jewish Awakening would come about, and second, what gives us any warrant to believe that this newfound sensibility would be any more durable than any other Jewish accommodation?Because in the end, as you point out, thisNovus Ordo Iudaeorum, if it ever took place, would be entirely on their terms, for their own benefit, and lasting exactly as long as those two conditions obtained.

                There is another wave of Jews coming into the equation. The secular American Jews are not much reproducing, or they are mixing. The Orthodox and Hassid are having large families. It is assumed that since these are not liberal secular Jews and said to be aligned with traditional American interests that the problems created by secular intellectual Jews and the force they represent will abate, but  I suspect this new hatchery will have other ideas if only because there is no history to the contrary.

            LineInTheSand:%  “Z’s best case outcome is that American Jews continue to value the Jewish people over the USA, but that they be more loyal to their Golem host country because it serves their interests.”Brilliant comment.  FWIW, this is precisely what I accused Zman’s “conservative” Jewish commenter with, and he countered that I was letting the perfect be the enemy of the good when he supposedly agreed with me 90%.  Well, if that 10% difference is viewing Western civilization and people as useful for his own, as opposed to loving it because it is one’s own and/or because it is a great thing of value in and of itself, then no deal.

        For all the kvetching about gas chambers and nationalism, it was the white world who saved their asses at great financial and blood expense.WHY are there holocaust museums all over America?  We had literally nothing to do with it. It wasn’t our people being killed and we weren’t the ones doing the killing.  For a group who (supposedly) prides itself on anti-racism, it is the racial connection we have to Germans that makes us so suspicious to them that they feel the need to erect holocaust museums all over our country.  Even fascist Italy did nothing to the Jews.The Holocaust is what defines them today.  If Jewish identity really meant something to them, they would go to Israel to be with their own people.

            Here’s an artical by Patrick J. Buchanan in The American Conservative entitled ” Is America Still a Nation?” It’s dated July 4 2017. I wish I had found it yesterday but hey, better late than never.https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/is-america-still-a-nation/Having lots of rich influental Jews around is a bad idea no doubt. But we’re all still thinking in 20th century ways. The damage is done. We are on the other side of the tipping point and the future is all we can hope for. Every single White person in America trying to lay the spiritual foundation for a new White world is worth 6 million rich Jews.

        I think people in general thirst for identity.  I notice that persons connected with Jews by marriage—even in the extended family—fervently take up Jewish attitudes on politics and Zionism.  The thrill of belonging to a special tribe, with secret missions and secret identities, and special exceptionalisms over one’s peers is very compelling to the human psyche at some level.  It’s the reason all these people keep finding evidence of Jewish ancestry in their family trees.  Jewish identity gives vent to our innate tribalistic inclinations without the shame and guilt  that comes with white identity.  We are sectarian, tribalistic animals by nature.  It’s the same reason some of us find the alt right et al. enticing.

        The dilemma of resurgent nationalism in the West for the Jews or the Occidental awakening of the Jewish role in the decay and corruption of our societies (the JQ) – is a moral problem at a civilizational level because it is a problem at the most fundamental level: it is a problem of group biology and the conflict between the very different group social-evolutionary paths they’ve followed for eons.If biology is important then the laws of nature are important.  Man is part of nature and thus subject to how it functions. This includes a group’s social structure and the complex manner in which it has evolved and how it functions.There are degrees of compatibility and incompatibility between these groups.  We can do better at learning to cooperate in constructive ways. But forced successful group integration is well beyond our complexity horizon and is destructive to the natural evolutionary course of all groups.

        There is a difference in recent decades, and that is that Jews do have their own nation now, and are free to move there.  The whole idea that they need to live here, yet not adopt their host country as their own, is now a false one, and they can now be called on it.  What some of the individuals are really after is the opportunity to take advantage of other people in other places, without the responsibility for it (they aren’t the only ones, there are many other representatives loyal to their own alien cultures here, not residing in their own home nations, doing the same thing).

        Whether they like it or not (and many most assuredly don’t) Jews are going to have to come to terms with the fact that the survival of the Jews as a people is tied up with the survival of the West and its distinctive peoples, and that flooding the US and Europe with people who are actually Medieval in their attitudes towards Jews is a bad, bad idea for them. Interestingly, lots of Israeli and British Jews seem to have little problem with this, but among American Jews, exceptions such as Stephen Steinlight are still something of a rarity.

                Because bringing Mohammadans into America and allowing them in our government is very, very bad for everybody no just Jews, that’s why.   It is bad for your sake and mine too.  One needn’t be a Jew to recognize an enemy with terminal ambitions towards oneself.

                    Why the Straw man?
Why do you not assume that the Jew is the “terminal enemy”?
It is undeniable that they have done orders of magnitude more damage and destruction in the US than Muslims.
Hows the Frankfurt Schools “Polymorpheus Perversion” working out for you?

                        Afternoon Bile…did you get grumpy black pilled today?.A bad 4th?..Yes, the Frankfurt School has for almost 100 years been rolling out Nihilism…Nihilism…Nihilism…Chaos …Destruction of Western Civilisation….and they have succeeded in a magnitude greater than Islam, in current history. BUT I have faith watching over time your written thoughts that you can juggle two+ balls at one time and not go into cognitive dissonance. Islam is in resurgence. Altitude Z and Hoagie are right also! This is the new threat in addition to the continual assault of Marxism.Now we face in sweeping Islam the two societal survival qualities Z described just yesterday that pushes a group to success, i.e. Close intermarriage and cousin marriage, and Fanaticism.“I would gladly give up my life for two brothers or eight cousins. The willingness to sacrifice for others is driven by genetic proximity.” AND “Fanaticism is one of man’s great inventions, as it overcomes this biological reality. Those men fighting on foreign lands, will see their comrades as brothers, through the shared fanatical devotion to a cause.”–The Great Z ManBile…..you are both right. We need your bile fighting against the Imperial Capitol rather than our tribe. Combine the success of the Frankfurt School, diaspora Jews’ conflicted loyalty, with the newer threat of Islamic societal success, and therefore we are in deep shit!  Very, very bad for everybody and not just Jews! It is a parlor game to say this group has done more damage than that group.  So what! They are all doing damage at the same time in history right here and now, and it is all cumulative and individual group chaos still adds up to Destruction of Western Civ.It is all of the above groups now that have washed ashore. It doesn’t matter in what proportion.This is from Daughter of Trots whose Frankfurt School parents contributed greatly to the destruction. I know you can juggle 3 balls at the same time because you have a good brain.

                        It would seem that the Jews in a Western society are like having a mental disease that slowly eats away at your ability to reason and defend yourself – whereas mixing in Muslims is like catching a flesh eating bacteria that just eats away at your physical body.

            This is a common misconception. Jews don’t have any qualms about flooding their host nations with Mohammedans and other savages. They’re well aware that Muslims dislike Jews, and they accept the fact that they occasionally go boom with a certain amount of collateral damage.But all things considered, they’re far less worried about the occasional exploding Mohammedan than they are by the prospect of ethnically cohesive Western host nations generating their own political and financial elites who might threaten Jewish interests (however defined). Ethnically divided polities filled with low-IQ brown people are far easier to manipulate and control, and wealthy Jews are confident they can mitigate any potential personal risks by staying well away from the fray.Are they correct? Time will tell.

                Murray is correct.Israel (with help from our DoD and State) created ISIS.
Iraq, a secular, socialist state, used to have thousands of Christians, even Jews.  They’re all dead now, and the Yazidi are still slaves of ISIS.

        There is a deeper divide or problem – that Jewish means both race and religion.So Christian Zionists support a secular socialist state where Tel Aviv is the most LGBTQ friendly city in the world.  Somehow the unbelieving secular and socialist Jews are still fully Jewish while burning the Torah, blaspheming, and doing abominations..There are Jews that do believe in the Torah, but many of them don’t care for Israel.  E Michael Jones uses the greek word Logos, which means the word, but also order and reason.  But the only thing which allows Israel to get away with anexxing and partitioning is the biblical cliam.  That masks the dual loyalty problem with end times bible prophecy (Darby-Scofield Dispensationalism).  Israel isn’t so much a nation as a key to unlock the second coming of Christ.Prager and Shapiro are trying to leverage their orthodoxy and therefore opposition to things like gay marriage, but they tend to preach to the choir.  Why not go tell the 70% of Jews that voted for Hillary?  But P&amp;S are the good, respectable face so Christians won’t notice that most Jews celebrate Abortion, Gay Marriage, Open Borders, and such.  But Shapiro spoke freely about Jesus and it was blasphemous to a Christian.Then there are the Talmudic Jews.  From what I gather, the Talmud is a collected series of loopholes to the Torah, much like SCOTUS Turns our constitution into a “living document”.  God ordered all debts cancelled every 7 years?  Well, if you sign and agree to it, God’s law can be superceeded.  The laws against theft, false witness, murdere doin”t apply to the Goyim, etc.  These are anti-Logos Jews.Meanwhile Jews seek more repairations for the Holocaust.The Holocaust put the fear of death, but not the fear of God into the later generations of Jews.

            About 5 years ago I subscribed to E Michael Jones’ “Culture Wars” magazine.  He defended (and praised) the Mullahs extensively, having been given a trip to Iran.  Mike can yap about “logos” all he wants, but he cannot possibly square than with his apparent love for Shi’a Mohammedanism.

            As far as the Jews being both a race and a religion, I think that is a reason that a lot of normies (in America, at least) don’t get how there could be any issue with Jews.  Often people see it as just another religion.  People are less religious than they used to be and even the religious are for freedom of religion.  For instance, a committed Catholic isn’t going to have any issue with Protestants from whatever denomination being involved in public life.  If people have an objection to any sort of religion, it is opposition to Muslims due to their tendency to explode unexpectedly.  To many people, talking about the J.Q makes about as much sense as talking about the Methodist Question.

                As Chesterton noted, more and less, the loss of religion does not make people unbelievers, it leaves them in a state of believing anything. There exist more dogma among the new unbelievers than in the heyday of any other religion.

        Gentile whites are experiencing levels of self hatred previously only observed in the Jewish population. Jews, who love to talk about themselves and their neurosis, will say many things regarding it; my choice of winner is that it is an internalization of their state of affairs. When this happens in someone who lacks the knowledge and full context of Jewish history (ie: they fucked up, badly), it produces extreme guilt which manifests in ridiculous ways.We see this now with gentile whites, however it took a false history to produce this. A reconnection to authentic history is what will allow individual westerners (and frankly anyone) to, at a minimum, accept themselves. Truth is the fastest, most sure way back to reality, and once there, we can begin the groundwork of repairing our society. The longer we wait to start by continuing to believe lies, the more voluminous the work of the Purgatorio made real will be, but at least it will be better than the present Inferno.

        Only marginally on topic, but I fell for it again.Remember Mengele, the Angel of Death?  Inhuman experiments, injecting blue dye in the eyes, pulling teeth for fun, transplanting random organs from one subject to another?Turns out his ‘victims’ wanted in on the gravy train, and formed a fundraising group called “CANDLES”.None had any scars or evidence of surgery.  Mengele, having been wounded in the war, was reassigned to Auschwitz as a psychologist.  He observed groups of twins and a family of dwarves, and took notes.That’s it, as he had no medical training.How, how, how did we ever fall for the deranged, demonic dreams of these absolute madmen?  The endless blood libel of our people?

                Carson, some of them were sadists, and they rose to the top in an authoritarian system.  Look at the Dem candidates today, and you get the same vibe.
Not to counter your point, which is a good one, but be very skeptical about those who say “it can’t happen here”.  The bonfire is prepared, and it is waiting for the match to light it off.

                It all sounds so ludicrous in retrospect.Just so.Never mind the lamp shades, but we’re supposed to believe that in three years, they disappeared six million people plus six million lesser victims, makingtwelvemillion people?Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and all we get is frau Goldberg suddenly remembering 40 years later how Mengele raped her six million times.Auschwitz is a nuclear landmine waiting to blow up. In twenty minutes, you can explain anyone with a high school understanding of chemistry (and, critically, the will to listen) why the gas chamber in Auschwitz is a hoax.They recently ripped off the Dutch (again), and soon, they’ll be coming for Denmark too.

                        The short version is that there were made two forensic examinations of what’s purported to be the remains of the big gas chamber in Auschwitz. One by a gentleman named Fred Leuchter, an American expert on gas chambers, and another by a German chemist named Germar Rudolph.http://germarrudolf.com/en/persecution-2/germars-persecution/auschwitz-forensics/They measured the cyanide content of the purported gas chamber remains and did the same with the walls of what’s called “the small gas chamber” – a building everyone agree was used for fumigating furniture and clothes with Zyklon B.They then compared the results…****SPOILER ALERT!!!****The fumigation chamber was saturated with Prussian Blue – a cyanide decay product – while in the purported gas chamber – where they killedsixone million Jews, the levels were barely detectable above the background pollution.There’s a ton of stuff about it on the internet still, all you have to do is google.

                Carson, if one simply disbelieves the evidence for the holocaust, then there is no sense in arguing whether or not Germans could descend into such barbarity—because it didn’t happen.However, if you read any of the tomes of writing surrounding German atrocities, you find many citations for such barbarity by rather ordinary German citizens, not necessarily fanatical NAZI’s.  Citation in point, “Hitler’s Willing Executioners”.It created quite a stir a decade or so ago in Germany.  It contained the field reports from the SS on their use of Home Guard (old/young Germans) who were used to shoot prisoners toward the end of the war when they were desperate to speed up the removal of undesirables before the oncoming Allied push overran them.But forget the Germans as that seems a hot topic for debate.  Just look at the historical references to all sorts of events past and not so past to judge how much closer we are to animals, than angels.  Here’s another book, “Scalp Dance”, a compendium of the US Army scout “after action reports” of the Plains Indian wars of the 1860’s to 1870’s.  The reports of Indian atrocities are myriad and Sheridan (yes, the civil war general) fought a simple war of genocidal extinction in return.No judgement passed.  We did what we needed to do, so did the Indians.  They lost, we won.  But it was nothing to be remembered as “uplifting” or glorious.  Nor was it seen as that at the time.

                    if one simply disbelieves the evidence for the holocaust, .What evidence?“Holocaust”, doesn’t mean any random massacre perpetrated by the SS, it’s very specifically the killing of1) six million Jews by means of2) gassing, according to3) a centrally organized plan that was4) endorsed by Uncle Adolf himself.Those are the four main points of contention with Holocaust revisionists. Disbelieving any of those four points makes you liable for criminal prosecution in several European countries.And Daniel Goldhagen is a nose of the most repellent description. Hitler’s Willing Executioners is broadly discredited as a dissembling, hateful screed against the German people, a blood libel. Not even Jewish scholars cite him.

                            I’m not going to engage in a holocaust debate with you.
If you don’t want to debate the Holocaust, I suggest you don’t post comments on the subject in a public forum.

            Alvaebo, as far as I can tell, Mengele was a Physician (Wikipedia) with some bonafides in genetics and the racial nonsense spewed by NAZIs of the day.   Prior to WWII an MD degree was not the thing it is today.  Mengele was good enough to initially work in the Wehrmacht field hospitals until reassignment to Auschwitz in ‘43.  Anyway, he was absolutely crazy and perhaps incompetent given the record of his experimental efforts.  A basic senior in HS with biology courses would know better that to attempt his procedures.

                Almost no one alive today was involved in all of that death camp stuff, yet talk of it goes on, and on, and on.  Somehow blame and accusation has run out into western culture generally, in some amorphous, generalized fashion.  The way it is going, historians of the future will sum up the twentieth century as ”six million”, ignoring everything else.A culture at war with itself, as most human cultures have been, most of the time, creates a lot of misery and casualties.  The sad thing is that the six million were not actually exceptional.  This pattern has been repeated over and over again, and often internal to countries, in civil war fashion.

Why1-tattoo hapless captives scheduled for imminent execution2-feed, clothe and house valueless women and children so they remain alive until after the war ends3-utilize scarce fuel to incinerate millions of human bodies while being closed in on two sides by mortal enemiesFollowing services at various synagogues and sporting my fancy kippah to blend in with Jewish hosts, I have remained with “the scrum” of major donors who linger with the rabbi and listen to the special pep talk. The rabbi invariably uses parable to encourage attendees to stick together against the others and concludes with “remember the six million.”  Over recent decades and every single time I attended as an imposter.

                            They’ve termed any Jew alive from 1933 or so to 1945 anywhere but in the US, Canada, or Australia to be a Holocaust survivor – look it up.

                                Victimology, is symptomatic of a general pathology in today’s society.  Holocaust victimology should have given us a forewarning of the problem of such identification.  As Dutch has pointed out, it never ends—long after the victims and the perpetrators are long dead, the grifters will continue to promote such as long as it pays dividends.  Trick is to ignore it.

                During research for a documentary on Mengele I noticed a proliferation of outrageous claims, not just of Mengele but of the climate in which the claimants placed him. I decided to keep a separate list of only supportable evidence, not just supported by the testimony of dubious characters.My intent was to still give credence to some of the more outlandish tales and of course to those things we “knew” were true because they had been reported so often. But after completing my research I decided it would be criminal to ignore my ultimate finding. Mengele was a decent man and a good doctor that became the unfortunate vessel for a fictional horror story.Mengele never performed any of the experiments attributed to him. He never acted brutally to anyone during the period in question. On the contrary, conflicting and always ridiculous stories are told about him to serve different interests. I think, without Mengele the camps become a far less horrible and more reasonable place.

        We have 2000 plus years of case studies to demonstrate that jews will not become loyal to the heritage people of the united states. They will always seek power over their host and will collaborate with enemies to undermine their host if given the opportunity to do so.Besides being a source of group cohesion and a great way to extort money and silence critics, the myth of the holocaust is used to keep jews in a state of panic and get them to  view any white gentile as a potential immediate threat.Lenin reportedly said that Jews make good useful idiots. We see that in how average Jews in Europe and the US have been brainwashed into supporting insane immigration and social policies that are detrimental to them in the long term.

        Belated counter-Semitic counterpoint.  Semitic identities are not compatible with our tribes, as both Muslims and Jews continue to demonstrate.  The viral concept of “Judeo-Christianity” alone has served to grossly (and I fear fatally) debase, distort and deligitimize Christian spirituality.  Kevin MacDonald and others have thoroughly documented why and how Jews parasitize and fragment host populations in the manner of high-functioning gypsies. Heartiste, peace be upon him, coined the phrases “Ashkepath” and “worrier-warriors” to describe the unique Jewish genetic blend of neuroticism and aggression.  In enneagram parlance, Jews as a race are counter-phobic Sixes. To the extent Jews practice Jewish identity, they are socially corrosive to our  American and European White tribal communities.Z posits that a new identity could be formed which would break with this unfortunate legacy, but biology will have its due.  Genetic worrier-warriors will not trust White Americans enough to transfer their true loyalties.  I will concede that, to the extent outlier Jews could form this tiny new tribe of NAJALTs, they could serve as our interface to Jewry at large, but the vast majority of identitarian Jews would ostracize them.My ideal America 3.0 has core ethnic areas and “free cities” which are politically firewalled from the ethnostates ala Hong Kong, with their suburbs serving as slightly mixed interface/commerce areas. Jews are welcome there but are barred from law, politics, media, academia and finance given their proven track record, and can only lease, not own, property (once again, ala Hong Kong).  Since we won’t have fictitious business entities like corps or LLC’s, their ownership of non-prohibited businesses will keep their skin in the game. If they want “human rights,” they can make aliyah with the generous funding my happy, homogenous Whites provide to minorities who find us oppressive.

        I don’t think the answers to the dilemma will be universal among members of the tribe.  I had a roommate in the Marines who happened to be Jewish.  He sure identified far more strongly as an American Marine than a Jew.  He just went to a different religious service.The New York conservative Jews I see in droves whenever I travel out of Newark always see themselves as guests and not Americans.  They’ll pick up and leave if things get unpleasant – I sat next to one on a plane who had just left Venezuela.  Would have guessed he was a New Yorker if he wasn’t talking to NY Jew during the flight.The liberal (mostly non-observant) Jews are the ones who’ll fight (financially and legally) against nationalism.

            Something we are seeing in America is that Jewish identity, biological and cultural, is more of a result of exogenous forces than internal cohesion. The hostility of host populations kept Jews together and gave them an identity. In America, with the frontier culture and a heterogeneous white population, that exogenous pressure has been removed. The result is a rapid boiling off of the less fanatically tribal Jews to the point where Jewish identity is collapsing.I tend to think stoking the old antisemitism fires is a way for Jews to avoid facing the crisis within the diaspora, but I have not put a lot of time into thinking about it.

                I used to be a regular reader of Commentary magazine. The loss of tribal cohesion you talk about was a recurrent theme in that journal. I also think that it is a major cause of immigration to Israel. Guys get married, have kids, and see their sons and daughters becoming interested in gentile companionship. Boom. Family gone to Israel with little or no warning.

                Small point, Zman, Jews don’t have to “stoke the old antisemitism fires” if they just read the comments section in here or any of several other d-right websites. It’s like the Archer meme: “Do you want more lefty Jews ’cause that’s how you get more lefty Jews.”

                Zman:  ” The hostility of host populations kept Jews together and gave them an identity.”
Only partially true at most.  In many countries the Jews lived separately by their own choice.  They did not learn the local language or intermingle with local culture by choice.  That separation also included a barely disguised contempt for the locals.  Add in extortionate economic practices and protection/favoritism from the local elites, and you got/get massive resentment.

                While I agree that for many Jews Jewish identity is collapsing, but what seems to be gaining strength is anti-white animus. That may be mainly because they are trying to ride the multi-ethnic tiger that is the democratic party. But I think a significant reason is historical memory that will not soon go away.

        The issue, bluntly, is that the diaspora has no serious challengers. Nationalism is not being considered by the diaspora. It is being re-branded as diaspora neoliberalism. There will be no further discussion of the subject. Nobody can press the issue. The remnant western gentile elite are simply impotent or subservient. A people without an elite are serfs.

        This strikes me as similar to Belloc’s little book, _The Jews_, written about a hundred years ago and making some of the same points: mostly, that Jews are playing a dangerous game and ought to stop it for their own good or else something really awful will happen, possibly in eastern Europe.There’s a vignette in St. Gregory of Tours where one of the Frankish kings, Guntram or somebody, tried mightily to convince a Jewish friend to convert to the Church, to become one of us. No doubt, for exactly the same reason. That didn’t work, either.I think, as a survival strategy, it makes more sense for them to keep running these risks than to change. 1,500 years ago they couldn’t change because they hated us, 100 years ago they couldn’t change because self-segregation would mean loss of power, today it might be some combination of both.

                More like this, please.  A terrific comment yesterday noted that America was becoming a new blend of Europeans, an ummah that had escaped our intratribal wars, that nearly lifted the homelands up and out along with us.
Perhaps we could show the Old World peoples- including people with white skin who are not of European origin- a way away from the backstabbing and murder.

The West Bank of the Hudson and the west bank of the Potomac refer to America West of NYC and DC respectively, the other rivers are in Europe.
I mean:  They confuse America and Europe with their Helots on the west bank of the Jordan- the Arabs.

        Come to think of it, the Romans had many religions under their roof.  Even dread Cybele was allowed.Yet one small cult had its leader crucified, then his apostles hunted down in grusome spectacles years later.  It wasn’t Jews they were throwing to lions or lighting up as human torches, just for being Jewish.Yet even so, the Romans reversed course, suddenly, destroying the very nation of His opponents, and began to embrace these heretical pacifists.Why the hideous persecution in the first place?  Why the reversal?Almost as if someone with high ties were telling stories, accusing that small cult of the blackest magics.Then these Romans, deeply religious, devoted to honor, justice, and Law, these Romans discovered something.They discovered they had been lied to.  Lied to in the worst way, bringing them to horribly violate all they held sacred.  Their rage knew no bounds.

        so after the Second World War, they pounced on the opportunity to anathematize the concept of nationalism.
Maybe.  However, Codevilla argues that the Progressives began pushing the concept of ‘war ONLY for world-peace’ rather than ‘national interest’ back in the early 1900’s with Root and Stimson.  Eventually that theory captured the (D) Party as well, which resulted in Truman’s shit-canning of MacArthur.
See:https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/the-tipping-point/
This is not to argue that Jewish intellectualoids were NOT part of it–they clearly were, and remain so.  However, this began long before WWII.

            That is not very persuasive. Those appeals to internationalism were quite obviously in service to American interests. Progressives first conquered North America then set their sights on Europe. What Codevilla is describing is imperialism, not anti-nationalism.

                “in service to American interests”???
Only if such interests were imperialist–which was NEVER an “American interest.”
You confuse “American MONEYED interests” with “American interests.”  Big difference, although money has done very well in purchasing politicians here.

                    The average American has certainly benefited from access to oil supplies and cheap imported goods. This has been at great long term cost, but very real short term benefit.
We can’t solely focus on the elite here, the average person has exercised their purchasing power poorly.

There are imperialists who happen to be American, but not all Americans are imperialists.  Not by a long shot.  AFAIC, take Puerto Rico, Samoa, the Virgins and Marianas back, thankyouverymuch!  And if you ran a valid poll, I’m betting 60+% of Americans will be with me on that.

                        And what did you get for that?  Puerto Ricans allowed free access into the country to fill up the welfare rolls – and populate some areas to such density that they’re sending people like AOC off to Congress.Are you really trying to argue that all of the downsides of American Imperialism (which DIRECTLY connects to the current condition where we’re overwhelmed with turd worlders BTW) – are worth having the Marianas, US Virgin Islands – and American Samoa?So what – we’ve got a good place to conduct nuclear tests, go on vacation – and get a few good football players?If you define “American interest” as it’s usually defined by the Neocons – well then yeah:  all of those places are “worth it”.  And so is the Mideast and Africa too.On the other hand if you define “American interests” as it would have been defined by the founders – well then all of those places are symptoms of disease – not something to be celebrated.

        I think you’ve outlined the Jewish dilemma quite well but I think it highlights a bigger problem that no one talks about it this corner of the universe, namely the atheist dilemma. The Jewish dilemma is also the atheist dilemma, namely how do you claim a heritage in a culture whose foundational principles undercut your own identity.Neoconservatism attempted to erase the history of Christianity from the West, but atheo-conservatism is trying to do exactly the same thing. While it’s not secret that the Jewish community pushes the liberal agenda strongly, it’s also true that a large number of gentiles are doing the same, reinterpreting the history of West to fit their own personal agenda and attempting to write out Christianity at the same time.

                Abortion is certainly shameful, as is promiscuity.
We must recall, however, that whites are of reduced fertility because we often see it as shameful to have a child that we cannot afford, or because we are concerned for the environment. There also might be some pollutants affecting fertility.
Whites do normally have more children than East Asians.

            Israel has a TFR of 3.1 for Jews. That is higher than any other OECD nation. In 2000, 67% of births were Jewish, last year 74% of births were Jewish.
They’d run into some headaches if the West Bank was annexed, but they don’t become a nominal minority unless Gaza is also annexed. I suspect any annexation deal would see a large amount of Arabs paid off to go away.

                The issue has more to due with the competing rates of Haredi vs seculars. Seculars are above replacement, IIRC, but the Haredi TFR is over 5. The Haredi and Arabs aren’t drafted, placing a burden on the proportionally shrinking seculars. That said, Jewish fertility is trending up in Israel, while Arab fertility is trending down. The numbers have changed a lot since the start of the century.

                    Unlike the Amish, who also have a high birthrate, the Haredi typically collect welfare because the men spend their lives in yeshiva.  That’s also true in NY and NJ.
Self-reliance is a goyim virtue.

                        Ris _Eruwaedhiel:  Despite their supposedly beloved kibbutzes, Jews do not  . . . have not ever . . . farmed anywhere in the world, to my knowledge.  They argue this is because they were prohibited from owning land – but that’s just it – they wanted to be property-owning landed gentry, not tenant farmers like the Christians they despised as cattle.  No one stopped them from growing food or becoming settlers when America offered essentially free land out west – even those relatively few Jews who left the east coast cities became peddlers and merchants to the farming settlers – by CHOICE.

            Some very smart people have postulated that one reason Israel is desperate to start a war with Iran (with us fighting it of course) is that they know that will be a much bigger shindig than Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria combined.
During the fog of war they can take care of their Palestinian problem once and for all.  So the theorists say.

        Comparing the last two blog posts, one is essentially about the essence of America, the other about the JQ. This post already has more comments and I m sure it ll reach 200 before it peters out. That’s not good, that’s not healthy, that the JQ gets more attention than what kind of nation America is and is becoming.
There’s something about letting hatred taking over, playing defense, conceding defeat through bitterness over that distribution of attention according to my immediate intuition. This despite my view that the JQ should not be taboo.

            Sorry to break the news, pal, but America ceased behaving as a coherent nation when the Cold War ended and there was no resultant peer.  And this is not independent of the JQ, it is causal.Why in nearly every territory that has hosted “Joos” has a there been a perceived need to address the JQ? You have to be intoxicated, otherwise self-absorbed or an idiot not to acknowledge dancing around the 500 gazillion ton elephant in the room. Bueller?No slice of America can be restored until the Joos are expelled from therein and banished forever thence. There is no middle ground with Schlomo, he’s always haggling for a “just share.”Just share with Schlomo (everything, and then just disappear).

                I’m undecided about the JQ, my impression is the evidence suggests there issomethingto look at. But, I do not find the ‘omnipotent universal explanation’ some seem to read into the JQ, to be credible.

                JQ is certainly important but so is white betrayal of  our country – namely in the business community with it’s insatiable desire for cheap labor which led to importing millions and exporting jobs and industry to Asia and leaving the U.S. emaciated and crippled economically.Really when will the alt-right get it through it’s thick skulls that corporate America  views the people of America as little more than serfs to be exploited and f**ked over.  Look how big box stores decimated small town America. I saw it first hand where I live. We didn’t benefit. People just got part time jobs in companies that hated them.Hammer the tribe, yeah they are over the top in aggressiveness when it comes to waging war against our society and economy. But so is the businessman with a MBA who off-shores a factory to China to increase his quarterly bonus.

            Correct. Have a care, Z. The antisemites swarming out of the woodwork here are the same ones that sunk idiots like Vox Day and Richard Spencer. For them there is no question, and no doubt about the JQ. More than a few are hateful nutters.
You’ve always portrayed yourself as undecided about the JQ. That would imply that you may see some good in Jews, somewhere. If that is true – would you care to elaborate on the positive potential of Jews, if any.

        Joos are loyal to God before country or anyone else – or at least the devout ones are. They are more loyal to Him than they are even to each other. I have no problem with this, as a Christian I am too. So go the muzzies – but those a-holes are a different can of worms. I like the fact that Israelis kill muzzies on a regular basis and wish them well with that in the future. We have precious few allies in that corner of the world.The American and European Jewry have a problem with radical liberalism. So do we ourselves – when the house burns down it will be the prog libturds that do it. Ben Shapiro is a harmless idiot – stop trying to turn him into something he’s not. We need to keep an eye on cretins like Feinstein – that feral cnut needs a fast trip down a short rope. Occasional Cortex and that moslem mudflap, Ilhan Omar could use the same treatment.Really, gentlemen – you will be judged by your taste in enemies as well as your friends. Some due diligence is certainly called for.

            Most North American “Joos” are not devout, except for the holocaustianity religion, and they do not even believe there is a G_d.  They are more loyal to each other and reject Him.
As for Muzzies, they never would have visited the US, let alone migrated here, but for Joos killing the sh!te out of them directly and by proxy.

                    It’s true. Zionism has the U.S. cultivating ties with the worst kinds of muslims — Sunni Wahhabist extremists. But the creators of Wahhabism? It’s said the Brits and Jews (Weizmann, who would go on to become Israel’s first President) put their heads together about 100 years ago to create Wahhabism and Saudi Arabia. All creations to extort power and political ends.
