        Haha!!! I forgot how funny derb was:
American blackness“: the cherished story, dear to the hearts of whites and blacks alike, of ugly snarling gap-toothed rednecks doing violence to meek, helpless, photogenic blacks.

            Remember the very first photo the media published of Trayvon Martin? You know, the smiling 12 year-old in the football uniform? Poor little All-American lad gunned down mercilessly by that awful white Hispanic! It was quite a while before the photo of the sullen, hoodie-wearing thug finally came to light.

        Eric Adams got busted for doing the same thing every black politicians does, which is to trade their influence for petty material goods and leaving a paper trail a mile long while doing so. This isevery single one. I wish it weren’t the case, I wish it wasn’t so obvious, but it is. Whether it is the ruler of a postcolonial state, or a governor, or a small or big town mayor, or a DA, they all seem to do it. In Adams’ case, it is stuff like airplane seat upgrades. Like, come on – the NYC procurement and expense process is, I am sure, so flimsy that he easily could have expensed that stuff to the city, but he just can’t help himself. None of them can. This makes them VERY useful for the blob. They are so easiyl corrupted and so easily influenced, yet their crimes are so stupid and obvious that they can be pulled out at any time they cease being useful. In Adams’ case, it was as soon as he called out the Brandon mass immigration bioweapon that he was launching into the USA. That will not do.

        ”Higher education” is a freaking joke – and a damned expensive one to boot.  It’s about time more are coming to this realization.  Just another institution in this dumpster of a country that needs to go up in flames.

        I don’t want to be dogmatic. I want to see the world accurately. If I am in disagreement with a person of good faith, I want to see their point of view.
Is Amy Wax good for whites?
All races have good and bad and whites decide on balance if a race is good or bad for whites. Most of us have decided that, even if we like jazz for example, blacks are bad to have around.
Even if Amy Wax is good, if you accept the good ones you will get the bad as well.

            This is exactly what Ramz Paul goes bananas about. he says we must accept the good ones: Clarence Thomas, suelle, unz.
well we are right back where we started with civic nationalism.
it’s become a non starter for me. If someone can’t say white nationalism, they must go go.

        Apropos to Friday’s, really, but I think there is a glaring flaw in the Montaigne/Zman refrain that “people (or religion) many not need a God, but they do need a Devil.”This flaw is the obvious difference between us and them, the the trads and the rads, the Left and Right:Trads need a God.It is the rads who need a Devil.The squealing you hear is the rads, trying to turn us, into them- to “win” the majority.Trads (traditionalists) accentuate the positive, strive to do rightly, accept reality’s boundaries, are more realistic and less self-serving. They have the ultimate good in mind, that is, obeying natural or divine law. Their pole is gratitude, and internal.Rads are sociopaths, narcissists, criminals, hellfire preachers, and spiteful mutants focused on the negative. They are paranoid witch-hunters desperate to find flaws in others. For them to feel anything or find meaning, their pole is resentment, and external.I also note transactional society breeds sociopaths, by simple necessity.Simply put, perhaps we can put this great divide in simple terms:Some seek friends; some seek enemies.Some (most) need a God, and some need a Devil.

        Re: Lowry
Does this qualify as karma or schadenfreude? I hope Mark Steyn takes a shot at the androgynous cuck Lowry, too. You are too much of a gentleman, John, although your last word on the topic put a smile on my face.

        Weird, I didn’t think it was blacks, women, or black women that had seemingly captured all the institutions.
I thought it was the Germans.
I must have been mistaken.

        (10f) Do not settle in a district ormunicipalityrun by black politicians.While agreeing with the general thrust of “The Talk”, I disagree with this particular conclusion. When choosing a place to settle, you have more information available than just statistical generalities. If the black politicians running a particular municipality have been in power for a good number of years, and you’ve investigated enough to determine that it’s still a nice place to live, the specific information should override the statistical generality.(10g) Before voting for a black politician, scrutinizehis/her charactermuch more carefully than you would a white.I would argue just the opposite. A black politician’s character flaws should be easier to spot, especially if you expect to find them. Plus, often a politician’s character isn’t the primary reason to vote for or against him. “He’s a crook, but he’s our crook” is a perfectly valid viewpoint. And I’d rate an honest Democrat as more likely to be dangerous than a corrupt one, who can at least be bought off.
