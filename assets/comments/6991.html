        The big mystery to me with the Rubio presidential campaign was the timing.  He had to give up his Senate seat to run in 2016.  He was young enough to wait until 2020 or 2024, and by that time he might have had some accomplishments.  There also was the complication that Jeb Bush was running, and a presidential candidate really should be assured of carrying his home state’s primary.I suspect that the GOP establishment planned on nominating Rubio, as the GOP version of Obama, and let him know that the path would be smoothed for him.  I also suspect that the path was smoothed for Bill Clinton in 1992.Obama was a different case, in that there was always going to be an anti-Hillary Clinton vote that would have gone to someone.  It was Hillary Clinton’s misfortune that her main challenger was someone who could take the Black vote away from her.  She would not have had much of a problem defeating Edwards.

        The whole alpha, beta, delta, sigma thing was quite a revelation to me. I agree that Cruz would be a political sigma. He’d be more of a gamma in the more results oriented places I’ve worked.I’ve had a hard time placing myself in that continuum. I know I’m no alpha.  In  another framework, I know I fit into the “sheepdog” category — I’m forever fighting off the “wolves” and trying to chase the flock from point A to point B for no real reason than I seem to get a great deal of personal satisfaction from it. Alphas are usually very antagonistic towards me, even if I’m minding my own business, but have often turned to me to fix their screw ups. I like people but don’t need them and am as comfortable with crowds as I am with solitude.

        So what does that make Kasich?  He keeps hanging around even further out on the fringes with absolutely zero chance of winning – but hoping the party bosses discover a way to toss him the nomination.  (Or VP slot, or Cabinet post, anything really)

            Kasich is probably a gamma. He’s most comfortable being in a supporting role. It’s why his governorship has been so mediocre. When he tried to replicate what Walker did in Wisconsin, he got squashed like a bug. So, he went back to the go along to get along style that works best for him.As far as his future, I think he is playing for the VP job. I don’t think he has any real interest in the top job. That’s always been my hunch with him. He’s getting old so eight years attending funerals adds to his pension and lets him live a comfortable life at the tax payer’s expense. At the convention he will try and be the honest broker rallying establishment support behind whoever is the nominee.

            I did and I am now convinced he has a bimbo problem. That was textbook non-denial denial. “Did you cheat on your wife?” “This stories have no place on America!”
It’s funny how these guys seem to like the game of cat and mouse. He could have said “hell no” and had his attorney send a public letter. Most people would then believe him. But, they can never seem to do it.

                And used the appropriate lawyerly weasel words. I like the way the press has quickly moved on past the “rodent copulation” quote. I get why he used copulation. But what was wrong with saying rat?Cruz has done this all wrong, if he is an innocent man. Someone tweets an unflattering picture of your wife? Do a press conference holding onto her and tell everyone that she will always be the most beautiful woman in the world to you. Someone asks if you’ve ever cheated on her? “Absolutely not! I have never been unfaithful to her”. See how simple? No need to talk about Roger Stone or say Trump is a meanie. The more I read about Heidi Cruz, the more she reminds me of Hillary.

                At the end of today’s Fiorina/Cruz clip, Cruz says: “I don’t think the people of Wisconsin  or the people of America have any interest in tabloid trash, I’m going to focus on the issues that matter to the American people.”This phrasing reminded me of a similar sex scandal where a President was giving his reasons for not wanting to answer any more questions about it.Bill Clinton 1998: “But I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I’m going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time; never. These allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people.”

                    I don’t live in Wisconsin of read the tabloids but the character of Gary Hart, Bill Clinton, and John Edwards is the business of the American people, and I ain’t going to read that in the New York Times am I? The problem for Cruz is that were Mr. Smarmy Face poking five women it could only improve his image.

        Trump seems to have the whole Alpha act down, but then the mask slips and I can’t buy it.
Alphas aren’t thin-skinned and touchy – but Trump really is.  Yelling “I’ll sue you” on a regular basis is a real wimp move.  Actually doing it – and constantly losing the cases is even worse.

            The thing to keep in mind with these descriptors is that they are not going to 100% accurate in all cases. Humans are not that simple. That and alpha males can be just as thin skinned as anyone else at times as “thin-skinned” is a relative term. People make fun of his hair and he laughs about it.

        Donald Trump “alpha male”, “sexually attractive” to women?  Oh please. The only women who find this creep sexually attractive are opportunistic super models.  Most women I know think the guy is a creep.  And as for this alpha, sigma, beta garbage…give me a break.  Donald Trump is a spoiled brat, bullying, snotty rich kid who has had everything handed to him in a silver platter from the day of his birth.  He’s far from being anything resembling a real man.  Maybe he’s what passes for a “real man” in cities–especially cities on the east and west coast–but I can assure you that quite a few of us regard real men as pretty much the opposite of this clown.
