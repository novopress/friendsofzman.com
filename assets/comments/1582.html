        #3 is one that always hacks me off as well. Peter Jennings was always my prime example of this… anytime he needed to pronounce a foreign word he sounded like a .10 thespian.

        You could add moral-relativism to the list. Whenever I have a discussion with people, usually younger than me, and raise an argument against something their standard response is “ah yes, but so-and-so used to do that in the past.”A case for this would be islam. If I point out an inconsistency in the case for, the off-pat reaction is “Well, Christianity used to do that too” or even “Yes, they did it more violently too,” and so on.I usually offer the line that we are not talking about what once was but what now is, though that rarely works. Having taken the moral-relativism line their view is that’s the end of it. No further thinking required.
