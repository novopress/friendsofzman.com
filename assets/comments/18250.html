            I would have acquitted Fields on the evidence, not merely out of solidarity.  In pre-Woke America, a jury of normies would have at worst found him guilty of vehicular manslaughter* and he‚Äôd be out in a few years. The fully-politicized Homeland, FBI etc‚Ä¶ are going to turn White Nationalists into Bobby Sands‚Äô IRA in short order.  We need to be ready for that crackdown, keep our heads and don‚Äôt make the mistakes the IRA made with vanguardist BS that set them back in public opinion.  Greg Johnson‚Äôs pieces on mass shootings at Counter-Currents, including this week‚Äôs latest, should be required reading for anyone flying our flag.*the same charge Bruce Jenner should have done time for after speed-bumping a Diversant, but hey, look at Caitlyn in that dress!

                    He‚Äôs not advocating violence or other wig-nattery, he‚Äôs noticing. We‚Äôre not going to reach the 25% level of true dissident leverage by pearl-clutching inside the Overtonberg Window where Con, Inc. has been trapped for decades.  NAJALT, and all that, but the idea that mentioning the JQ is verboten b/c upset normies is what guys like Yarzony are there to reinforce.

Yes. Here‚Äôs another excellent quote:
In 2015 and 2016, we won enormous victories by attacking the enemy‚Äôs weakest points from a position of strength. In 2017 we suffered enormous defeats because we thought we could attack our enemy‚Äôs strongest points from a position of weakness.

            This is the kind of comment you see at Brietbart and Instapundit a LOT. ‚ÄúOoh they won‚Äôt like it when we stop obeying‚Ä¶‚Äù
But this has been said for 40 years as everything gets more and more Pozzed. NOTHING HAPPENS. It will take a major shock to the system and a lot of people losing their comfort before we actually stop obeying, if we do at all. The Brave New World is *really* good at hitting the dopamine.

                    There is an order problem. Another Freddy Gray or Rodney King riot that spreads nationally with police withdrawing and forays into the suburbs tends to concentrate minds.
Normies hate riots. Hate even more having their homes looted. Elites ride the tiger. The Purge movies are the template for the non White lumpen proletariat.
Into such a political void steps a Caesar.

                        That is precisely why they will not let this happen.  BLM was getting out of control in this way and then suddenly, BLM just ‚Äúwent away‚Äù  Someone interfered and pulled back funding and organizational support for BLM.  BLM went from a major force in the country to nothing in a matter of a month of two. I‚Äôm sorry, but it did not just happen. Someone made it happen.
This is why I say  ‚Äònever attribute to incompetence what can be attributed to malice.‚Äô

                        Nothing much will happen till the Boomer die off and/or economic collapse . We‚Äôll just get a slow slide into 3rd world irrelevance with possible collapse and ACW2 scenariosThere is almost certainly not going to be a Caesar along the way . Anyone with such ambition   and ability  is either corrupted or otherwise dealt out of the picture. There are very men few like that and a big intelligence service to watch them.There might be a quiet one somewhere but its a slight possibility.In any case the rebel class is mostly Libertarian  which is the slightly saner version of LeftismThis means  the most they can manage is a tantrum . They combine some of the less savory aspects of both, lack of good moral direction of the Left and both the corporate fetish and lack of organization of the Right. It‚Äôs a useless toxic  ideology.if you are not willing to take freedom from people who clearly can‚Äôt handle its and /or you can‚Äôt handle the responsibility  of doing it right, you have no business with power.You won‚Äôt get it either.ironically one of the few authors to get that was  Canadian author David Brin . He‚Äôs nomenklatura up there but understood the militia which at the time were ‚Äúsurvivalists.‚Äù pretty wellIn his work the  Postman, basically Fed Gov was trying to rebuild and the survivalists who had turned feral and were well armed would accept no large scale order, periodIgnoring the ludicrous idea of an effective and benign USG   it was SF after all, this is exactly what would happen.The militia right once they‚Äôve fought and tasted blood will turn on any large scale order.There are millions of these guys BTWThe best way to get your Caesar is to get them and the rest of the Right  to embrace authorityIt‚Äôs doable. I‚Äôve seen middle aged and even older people go from moderate to more radical than me with a little pushIt doesn‚Äôt take many either.Last on this epistle , to something our host said. You can‚Äôt expect a great awakening since no one is offering anything betterHope and anger  of the fuels of revolution and our side doesn‚Äôt offer that.We offer despair. That won‚Äôt fly.

                    thezman said: ‚Äù My estimate is 90% of whites will happily happily embrace their own extinction. If you are counting on the people to save themselves, you will be disappointed.‚Äù America has always been about ethnic tribalism and regionalism. throw in some Democratic rugged individualism and there‚Äôs the good old U. S. of A. Now we‚Äôre living in the ass end of that prodject. One of the main components of decadence that Friedrich Nietzsche talked about was the loss of the will for self-defense. obviously, demoralization isn‚Äôt anything new. What‚Äôs new is a massive, generational project to gut the moral, civic and mythological foundation of a civilisation. Sure, some of this happend in all empires that went into decline. But not in the vicious, all or nothing way the left has attacked Western Civilization. It is I‚Äôm afraid simply too big, too intrenched, too well financed and too f**king late to do anything about it. If you want to save yourself and your loved ones, find your tribe and roll up your sleeves. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget. If you stay in America, your still in the belly of the beast. Plan accordingly.

                        Somewhere in my travels ‚Äì I read that one of the reasons why the Germans overran France so easily in 1940 , was because so many of the French were so deeply dissatisfied with the 3rd Republic ‚Äì that the welcomed the German invasion.No ‚Äúnation‚Äù can sufficiently defend itself ‚Äì when a critical portion of it‚Äôs populace wants to see it die.That‚Äôs why I think the critical effort here is to make sure that a critical portion of the white population comes to realize that the current order of things is solidly set against them.Get a critical mass of people with their heads properly black-pilled and immune to the endless stream of BS emanating from the left ‚Äì and this problem will resolve itself (one way or another) eventually.Fail to do that ‚Äì and you will inevitably lose.

Right now I‚Äôm having this vague sense that old or very long cycle patterns are slowly coming into focus and we are seeing why liberty and a ‚Äòfree society‚Äô is bound to do one of two, be swept away. Or embrace authoritarianism. I think this is basically what happened to Rome. And I think it is b/c a ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô is bound to be run by unconscientious grifters, liars and bullshitters.Democracy is a wonderful idea.

                    I don‚Äôt know if 90% of whites would happily embrace their own extinction, but I do suspect that 90% of whites will never lift a finger or even publicly support us until we‚Äôve already created a protected community of our own.If in the disintegrating society that is to come, 5% or 10% of whites create their own community and withstand the initial media outrage and legal fight, a large number of other whites will rapidly come to our side. Of course, by that point, we wouldn‚Äôt need them, and, in many ways, wouldn‚Äôt want them.Regardless, whites love living around other whites. They prove that every day.

                I go back and forth on this.  On one hand you are absolutely correct. Nothing has ever happened.  One outrage after another and no reaction.  On the other hand it could be that white people still believe they have something to lose.  That the system can still mostly work.By about 2025 when the medicare math just is not going to work anymore and a lot of the economy goes down with it then people will pretty quickly have their standards of living adjusted downward.  At that point when literally nothing is left to lose then maybe we get to war.

            The officials and judges can pretty much count on the right staying on the couch, and believing traditional order is still in effect, and the left owning the streets and imposing their own order when and how they please.  The heritage population of the country is well conditioned at this point.  I‚Äôd prefer to be wrong about this.

                    Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt imagine any pushback from conservatives/dissidents being organized, intelligent or effective. We have only a few intelligent voices, like Z Man, voices lost in the wilderness, for all intents and purposes, seeking reasonable minds to sway. If the pushback comes in the form of young white men shooting a bunch of innocent strangers, very soon the government will activate laws they have on the books about domestic terrorists that are just waiting to be activated, and life will get that much harder for all dissidents, on the left or the right. Then we‚Äôll watch as the law is applied per the whims of the global corporatists wielding authority, sniping all dissidents and making public examples of them. Conservative Inc will be OK with it because, most importantly, it‚Äôs done LEGALLY. The fruits of our bad schools and our Godless, gun-, violence- and smut-loving popular culture with our widespread use of drugs (prescribed, recreational, illicit) manifest themselves in people who do such Godless, heinous, sick crimes. Illiterate, purposeless people with bad ideas. The new Americans.

                This depends on how much lawbreaking . California is awash in laws and is actually quite lawless, Anarcho Tyranny really sucks but it is the way of the future.
Upside the USG and the States who are often a bigger more immediate threat, will sooner or later run out of money and thus the ability to enforce laws
We see this erosion with sanctuary cities, gun sanctuaries, weed legalization  and I expect to see more of this impromptu Federalism for good or ill.

        Z‚Äôs conceptual analysis here is largely correct, but his labeling and vocabulary are insufficient.  ‚ÄúCorrupt‚Äù is the correct term to use for the first phase of his analysis, viz. an official taking bribes to do special favors, thereby ‚Äúcorrupting‚Äù the purpose of the office.  But that is not the correct term for what we see in the courts.The courts and judges are not ‚Äúcorrupt,‚Äù they have been Judaized, in the exact same way that the universities, the press, the cinema, radio and television, the Internet tech hubs, the financial system, and the permanent bureaucracy have all been Judaized.Not everyone who participates in these Judaized systems is Jewish, they don‚Äôt have to be.  They simply have to have been infected with the Jewish mind worm, the Jewish conceptual and ruthlessly nepotistic apparatus which relentlessly promotes the unceasing Jewish will to power.The moment they set foot on this continent in the latter 19th century, the Jews surreptitiously declared war on America and Americans.  They knew perfectly well what and where the levers of power were, and set about immediately with feverish determination to control all of them.  Which they have quite successfully achieved.  They figured out which disaffected groups could be successfully weaponized against the Whites in order to fracture and demoralize (and now, simply drown and overwhelm) them, and they got that ball rolling successfully too.  Notice how 2A is about as Absolutely Carved In Stone as any American legal precept could possibly be, and yet it is nevertheless subject to unceasing, unrelenting, utterly unprincipled attack, deconstruction, revision, repeal.  This is not an accident.The same people who did this to Russia in 1917 are busy doing it to Americans now, and the consequences will be exactly the same: tens of millions of dead white Christian goyim, millions more starved, tortured, deported, raped, enslaved.It‚Äôs actually the case that the Americans lost this war quite some time ago.  We‚Äôre now in the mopping-up phase.  We have been living in a conquered, Judaized, uni-party state for quite some time, but in 2020 it will become official, open, and gloatingly triumphant. Just read Max Boot‚Äôs twittering about the El Paso massacre and how he parses it.You ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet.

            Jewish individuals and groups succeeded in reshaping their host societies to reflect their values, serve their interests and gratify their 2000-year-old spite against Christianity and even more ancient spite against the goyim in general.  Gentiles now hold views that were originally self-serving Jewish ones.I find it pathetic how evangelical Christians in particular fawn on the Jews and Israel.  Brings to mind what someone said about the Western-Soviet relationship:  ‚ÄúThey spit in our face and we call it dew.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not an original observation that groups that are liberal in the US aren‚Äôt liberal in their homelands.  It‚Äôs been pointed out that American Jews tend to favor one type of society where they are are a minority, such as the US, and the very different one for Israel.  In the US, the activists favor secularism, equalitarianism, multiculturalism and open borders.  Israel is quite the opposite.Many members of the Coalition of the Fringes are critical of Israel, regarding it as the last White Colonial power and comparing it to Apartheid South Africa.  Blowback on the Jews‚Äô past actions.

Jews may or may not regard themselves as White, and the lefties don‚Äôt seem to, but non-Whites do.  Uber Whites, if anything.

            For people who don‚Äôt do the Twitter, the reactions of ‚Äúconservative‚Äù Matt Walsh were absolutely amazing. After the El Paso shooter was hastily identified as ‚Äúwhite nationalist,‚Äù he was justitchingto unleash his Judaized response, something literally like ‚Äúhang all the white nationalists from lampposts, now!‚Äù
But when it emerged that the other killer was Antifa, he tweeted something like ‚Äúwoah, guys, let‚Äôs all calm down here, and not go to extremes.‚Äù
Guys like this are like Jewish-trained poodles, but with paychecks instead of doggie treats when they do the tricks right. They make me sick.

        It‚Äôs like the Sandman v. WaPo case where the judge threw out the case with prejudice declaring the news article was simply opinion.  The cherry on top has to be Roberts ruling the Obamacare fine a tax.
When I lived in a midsized Midwest city, I once wrote the city council members with a question.  The only one who replied was the old, union guy on council.  They later got him removed for the petty bribes you described.  I always had a soft spot for him because, while corrupt, he at least did his job.

The libel laws are much stricter and the WAPO undoubtedly published their lies there.
The downside is that damages are a lot less generous.

            I used to view the handful of landmark ‚Äúcreative‚Äù SC decisions as  justice(s) trying to protect the SC from intense public backlash.  Like bending a sapling to prevent its breaking ‚Ä¶ when the SC seemed to lag ‚Äútoo far‚Äù behind the leftward cultural drift. But maybe it is corruption more than a defensive posture. Imagine where we‚Äôd be without the last two of these decisions? Make that 3. or 4. Each one of them introduces major cultural watershed not easily reversed.

        Consider the 4th Amendment on one hand and Civil Forfeiture on the other. How was that even possible? And like any corrupt banana republic, local police and law enforcement seem more than happy to use it against law abiding citizens any time they can.
‚ÄúTo get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity.‚Äù Seems your legal system chose to ignore Coffin v. United States as well.

Many police departments now openly declare that they depend upon that seized revenue to continue to operate.
You‚Äôre gonna have to do a whole hell of a lot more black-pilling to build enough societal momentum to get it to end.  Just relying on some magical President to come is not going to EVER do it.

                            @Lineman,Some sergeants try to lambast and kick you into doing your duty. Others lead you. I‚Äôd experienced both before I became a noncom myself.I was assigned to a Sergeant First Class that was a borderline sociopath, narcissist, who spewed nothing but bile upon us all day. It worked to get some of us moving but only as far as we were in his view. I eventually rebelled and had just enough dirt on him so that no official action could be taken so he ‚Äúdemoted me‚Äù from the HQ unit ‚Äúdown to a rifle squad.‚ÄùI was ecstatic to be among my own (the ‚ÄúLine‚Äù). I was fortunate to land with a buck sergeant ‚ÄúL‚Äù who greeted me like a man and handed me a book. It was a worn copy of Starship Troopers. He said he had everyone in his squad read it. No expectations or speeches. Just read it over the next couple of days.To sum up.  Devoured the book.  Watched Sergeant L. He only ever asked what he himself would do. He smiled or laughed at hardship which made us laugh and carry on. Never had to yell. He would give us little nuggets of encouragement without being preachy. By the time we deployed for war I would and did follow him without question and in complete verifiable trust.I‚Äôm being windy again but my point is‚Ä¶ raging gets a few folks to move but I agree with you that rage and anger only carry the day so far. Hope, fraternity, and trust sustain the soul to confront hardship.

            Even worse, many so called ‚Äúred states‚Äù where the people cry ‚ÄúFreedum!‚Äù have the worst laws on this.  It‚Äôs actually pretty hard to do on the west coast.  It‚Äôs how shit kicking cops get new police cruisers.  I actually judge states on this particular metric, along with the legality of DUI checkpoints.  Imagine Thomas Jefferson going through a DUI checkpoint with Benjamin Franklin in the passenger seat.My county loves DUI checkpoints, like putting a TSA checkpoint on a freeway exit.  Collective inconvenience, collective punishment by wasting time.  Cops making overtime standing like clowns.  And if you‚Äôre going to do that at least be nice to people.

        Those of us who work in the kritarchy have known for years that many judges start with the result and use precedent, at best, to rationalize their desired result.  Like the military, the higher you advance, the more likely you are corrupt in the ideological fashion Z‚Äôs speaking of.  We go through the motions of doing hours of research and writing elaborate case law arguments, but we know that petitioning the court is more like begging and flattering King Louis than Plato debating Aristotle.  On mundane matters, issues are decided on the judge‚Äôs whim, and on anything with cultural or political undertones, it‚Äôs a question of who-whom.  I‚Äôve made it a point over the years to educate our clients about this to keep their expectations in line with reality, and it‚Äôs a helluva red pill.The justice system is the most ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù contact most Americans will have with the government, where they see the process at work at length and in detail.  Americans are still very focused on the justice system, as entertainment lineups demonsrate.  As the (((masks))) increasingly slip on and around the bench, the kritarchy will be a major acceleration factor in convincing normies that their government hates them and only uses the ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù against them.  I‚Äôm doing what I can to protect Our Guys, adjacents and normies who don‚Äôt deserve the system they‚Äôre stuck with, dropping red pills along the way.

        How much of this permeates the whole citizenry? It seems everybody is black pilled on justice in this country. Most may not be corrupt but totally don‚Äôt care or want to play boy scout anymore. That is all on our elites displayed fully by the court appointed deviants.My call to jury duty appearance last year gave me a good example of where we are.Most don‚Äôt even respond to the summons and those that do wail and connive to get out of it, and I am talking about a bunch of one day trials.Until Trump and even governors pull a Jackson and just totally defy court rulings, no remedy will ever be in sight. Then there is all the other major corruption, deep state and legislative.

            Maybe jury duty is a good place to start.  Any rightist who is summoned for jury duty should make it a point to respond, and do everything necessary to get on a jury. Including lying when the attorneys are trying to suss out your intentions.  Say whatever necessary to get on, then band together to acquit an accused on ‚Äúour team‚Äù, or convict the defendant if he is on theirs.  This is how we have to play the game now, and it‚Äôs necessary to practice it, like learning a new skill.

                        That‚Äôs the way I see it.  It‚Äôs not civic duty anymore; it‚Äôs an opportunity for guerilla warfare.  And the enemy is inviting you in.  Of course you don‚Äôt tell them what you‚Äôre there for; they‚Äôll find out when it‚Äôs too late.  And even if you can‚Äôt get an entire jury of like-minded people, you can at least gum their game.  One person on a jury can spoil an acquittal or a conviction to benefit our side and injure theirs.

                    Same here in my area. They even had a questionaire with 3 questions. White or Black was one. Can‚Äôt get negroes to show up.I counted (this is a major black city) , out of 80 seven were black. Should have been the opposite.The self employed provision used to work not anymore. An asian doctor who I befriended for the day closed down his clinic.

                Jury nullification (ignoring the instructions/law &amp; voting your conscience) is an American tradition since the Colonies, but many states in Second Founding America consider it contempt of court if you openly declare it.  So just do what the OJ jury did, with not a peep from starf*cker Judge Ito ‚Äì as the Dr. orders above.

As soon as you mention it ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty good odds somebody else on the jury will rat you out.

                    if  you can‚Äôt keep your mouth shut and stop posturing, you won‚Äôt last long as  a guerilla.

We‚Äôve got far too many people out there who seem to think it‚Äôs going to be Blue and Grey 2.0 with armies .Its not. It‚Äôs mostly not going to be dirty black ops and occasional audacious operations.As I‚Äôve said, maybe we‚Äôll get lucky and not have this happen , I certainly don‚Äôt want it but it‚Äôs not up to me.If you want a real life example from the Taliban.

                Been there, done that.  Unless you get on a Federal jury, your ability to cast a ‚Äúprotest‚Äù verdict is pretty limited.  Even on the grand jury (I was on one for 5 months), the bad guys are pretty obviously trouble for the community.  The cases are not usually political in nature.

                Dr. Mabuse:  That was fully my intent when summoned for jury duty about a year ago.  But somehow, even though the room was perhaps 65% White men, the ‚Äúcompletely random computer generated‚Äù first cut managed to include about 60% women ‚Äì two of them hijabbed ‚Äì a few Negroes and subcons and Mestizos to round out the perfect multicultural pool from which the jury would be chosen.  The game is rigged at every level ‚Äì it would be a  true rarity for a d-rightist to get on a jury.

                Trump should have wised up to that danger in the first few months and moved to neutralize it by taking hostages.  Every member of Congress should have been informed of the very unpleasant legal consequences awaiting their parents, children, cousins, in-laws etc. if they tried any funny business.  Instead he wrings his hands on Twitter and lets the years drip away with nothing to show for them.

                    To the extent Trump was ever legit, his generation was too steeped in Second Founding American Civ Nat loyalty to go full realpolitik ‚Äì which I agree was absolutely necessary to give us any shot to rush the DC cockpit.  I think the window for using the Presidency or other national offices for anything but strategic monkey-wrenching passed with Trump.  We needed a much younger, harder man for the job, but (((they))) have done a good job making sure that anyone so inclined already had their own ‚Äúhostage‚Äù problems to hamstring them. That‚Äôs what Epstein et al are there for.

        The case that you cited is a very good example indeed, because if anything is protected under the Second Amendment as written, it‚Äôs military-style rifles. This is one of the reasons that the Left used to always target handguns ‚Äì a (fallacious) argument could be made that they were not ordinary militia weapons, and thus not covered by the Second Amendment (the old name of the Brady Campaign was ‚ÄúHandgun Control, Inc.). But of course, the Left soon found that targeting handguns reeled in too many of their favorite minorities, so this was dropped. It‚Äôs been years, Hell, decades, since I heard the term ‚ÄúSaturday Night Special‚Äù. This term for a cheap handgun was the ‚ÄúAssault Rifle‚Äù of the 1970‚Äôs ‚Äì it didn‚Äôt really mean anything, but it gave the right feelz. If the current ‚ÄúAssault Rifle‚Äù blitz fails, they‚Äôll move on to something else, demonize some other weapon. What will never abate is their almost hysterical desire to disarm the American people. You have to wonder why‚Ä¶

                Out at the range yesterday, as we were enjoying ourselves all on our own, up drove a car load or two of mixed Whites, Mestizos, and a Negro couple.  The four of us had them severely outgunned, but it still soured my stomach to see any of them practice with firearms (even if it was clear none of them were particularly skilled).

            The length of that case is clearly politicized and tactical. A normal case would have been resolved in half the time even given the procedural gamesmanship.  National Review contributed to the mess, which is why Mark wisely went with his own legal team.

        It‚Äôs almost guaranteed that more than half of GOP-nominated judges turn out to be ravening progressive wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing. Yet we never see that with Communist-nominated judges.Hence that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a big believer in ‚ÄúRed Team jurists.‚Äù Just like the progressive judges, they‚Äôre guaranteed to come down on the side of the right every time, regardless of the facts. Just like the Blue Team judges, who are as predictable as the sun rising and setting every day.The rule of law is meaningless when one side decides they refuse to play by the rules and dictate the rules of the game on the fly to benefit themselves. We had a kid like that in our neighborhood and we refused to let him play with us for that very reason.If only we could do that with our Lefty friends. Maybe in the end the best we can hope for is a peaceful dissolution.

                Speaking for most of us who endorse the 5PT approach, we‚Äôre not looking for declared secession.  We‚Äôre simply going to start living in close proximity and building normal White communities in places the Empire doesn‚Äôt prioritize ‚Äì backwaters, cold weather, low population, not their beloved coasts and metro areas.  Then we‚Äôll boil the separation frog slowly through lax enforcement and passive non-compliance rather than strident civil disobedience.  Keep sending them taxes and keep our heads down, all the while growing our population and educating them our way.  Meanwhile the Empire will have its hands full keeping their orcs in line.

                    That‚Äôs a recipe for failure.
‚ÄúTaking over‚Äù non-strategic areas means that you will never win this war because when it finally comes down to a fight ‚Äì and it will ‚Äì the Orcs will have the numbers ‚Äì and the militarily strategic position to enforce their will.

                        Exile, Carlsdad,You both have reasonable arguments.Exile is right that, at least in the early stages of building a dissident counterculture, it‚Äôs easier to avoid the supposedly all-seeing eye of the State in locations that the Overlords don‚Äôt take seriously and where they might have fewer ‚Äúspies.‚ÄùBut this isn‚Äôt a struggle that can only be won by amaquisoperating in the hindquarters of the backwoods. Sooner or later, you have to subvert the Powers where they live and move and have their being. That‚Äôs where they are strongest, but most vulnerable: in later stages their might can be nullified by sand in the gears.Different tactics; different phases; one operation.

                    Well there is that county in Colorado I think that has declared itself a ‚Äú2nd Amendment Sanctuary Zone‚Äù. It‚Äôs a cheeky way to slap at the Left with all their ‚ÄúSanctuary Cities‚Äù and states that openly defy the Federal marijuana laws. It was Obama who decided *not* to send in the National Guard when the first states declared weed legal. When certain Southern states tried to stay segregated in the Civil Rights era the Guard *was* called in. That was probably too long ago though to infer much. Tellingly, Trump has followed Obama‚Äôs lead and hasn‚Äôt done much to rout the illegals from places like this (Portland) that proudly flaunt the federal law nor has he had the DEA move against the weed states.The US federal government has essentially lost all legitimacy with everyone, Left and Right, at this point for various reasons. The real question is whether any national leader Right or Left will have the stones to essentially go Peronist on the nation to hold the whole thing together. If we don‚Äôt get a national Peron there might arise certain regional Franco or Che Guevara like figures who will break off the first rogue republics. After that things will move quickly just like the Soviet collapse did. How peaceful or violent this process will be I can‚Äôt say.Edit: One factor I forgot to mention is that the US breakup may look less like the Soviet one and more like the India/Pakistan partition of the late 40s. You had millions of Hindus intermingled with Muslims all over the place. When the division came they all ended up on the road together, Hindus moving West, Muslims East. There was massive bloodshed as the streams crossed. This, of course, is what you have here. Millions of people live literally next door to those they would prefer not to be around politically, socially or occupationally. So that aspect of things favors the violent side of the violent/peaceful prediction.

        I‚Äôm seething w anger as I read this. I‚Äôm in Europe, and I‚Äôm telling all of you stateside right now that the 2nd amendment isimportant.Contrary to what some of you may believe, it is not superdifficult to get a firearm in Europe, in particular a hunting weapon which is of course a long gun. It takes some footwork, a hunting class, an exam you have to pass, a process that takes a few months in places like Sweden or Germany. A handgun takes significantly more paperwork and time but even that can be done.The real issue is thateverythinghas to be registered. So if you re planning on keeping it for in case the conceited Dunning Kruger circus running society cant protect you from their unforced mistakes, you will have to bet that they are so incompetent that they cant even confiscate your weapons before they fall off their horses. I guess w their astronomical levels of incompetency that may not be an entirely irrational bet, but still‚Ä¶.And you are never allowed to carry it in public. To and from hunting or the range you have to lock it down, possibly disassemble it etc. So except for home invasions you wont have it when you need it most.Last week, in Germany, an 8 yr old boy was murdered when he was deliberated shoved in front of an incoming train by a muslim and a day or two later, another muslim decided to chop someone up w a samurai sword in the street, also in Germany. In Sweden, where the gun ban only applies to law-abiding citizens, the story came out that Volvo had trouble finding ‚Äògood‚Äô immigrant workers b/c too many shootings in Sweden, w perfectly illegal but not imaginary, guns, by ‚Äòbad‚Äô immigrants, scares the former away.And all over Europe, every public square is now being stocked with huge concrete obstacles, often decorated as ‚Äòpublic benches‚Äô, flower stands, ‚Äòmodern art‚Äô or some other nonsense. B/c of the recent ‚Äòfashion‚Äô of vehicle jihad. So thank god the EU has registered all those legal hunters‚Äô shotguns‚Ä¶.. DEFEND the 2nd amendment. I used to not appreciate it enough.

            Impeach is probably not possible given the ignorance of the population.  What also might be effective is to assert control of the people over the courts rulings, such as the legislature vetoing such rulings when they overrule their legislation, something like the executive‚Äôs veto upon the legislature.  Of course, that seems improbable as well.

        I was never excited about Kegstand Kavanaugh since there are always enough finks, in Zman‚Äôs terminology, on SCROTUS to make sure the rich and powerful get what they want and that the dirt people lose.

Kavanaugh was always a system approved  faux conservative. The overreaction to his nomination was telling, however. Why are the courts so powerful that a milquetoast guy like him generates total panic?

            Milquetoast is right.  A writer at the NY Times suggested that Kavanaugh throwing ice cubes at someone in a bar while he was in university was grounds for not approving him.  Freakin‚Äô ice cubes!  I would have more respect for him if he threw a punch.  Geez, with an Irish name like ‚ÄúKavanaugh‚Äù I would think that he would enjoy a brawl.

        &gt;&gt;&gt;The new elite that coalesced in the middle of the last century lacked an historical attachment to the Anglo-Saxon form of jurisprudence. Instead, they either explicitly rejected that as bourgeois, and therefore illegitimate. Or, they came from a different legal tradition in which judges made and interpreted the law. &lt;&lt;&lt;
Oh Gawd!  Whomever could you be referring to?

                    For context, basically the story is the story of pretty much all tribal life in a stone/bronze age civilization.After a nice little genocide of the men, boys, and married women of Jabesh-gilead, the Israelites took all the girls and virgins and gave them to the Benjaminites. But this wasn‚Äôt enough, so they saw that a festival of the Lord was taking place, and told the Benjamites to go and ‚Äòsteal‚Äô themselves wives. Unclear exactly what that entailed. And then it basically ends with them saying ‚Äòeveryone did whatever they wanted to do.‚ÄôOh, and they gave these women to the Benjaminites *AFTER* a game-of-thrones style war involving a rape and then chopping up of a concubine‚Ä¶

                The term ‚ÄòJudge‚Äô in the book is probably better translated as ‚ÄòChieftain‚Äô, ‚ÄòLeader‚Äô, or even ‚ÄòConsul‚Äô, given the military leadership of the ‚ÄòJudges‚Äô in that book.

        A few observations.Perhaps the defining moment of the Trump Administration occurred in the first few weeks when the Administration acceded to a federal court ruling barring implementation of Trump‚Äôs travel ban.  There was no need for interpretation; the law was crystal clear that the President had authority to ban aliens, or groups of aliens, for any reason whatsoever.  Trump could have defied the ruling, told the officials in the relevant agencies to ignore any court orders purporting to stop them from enforcing the travel ban, and to disarm and take into custody any federal marshalls attempting to enforce the court‚Äôs order.  It could have been the equivalent of Reagan‚Äôs firing the air traffic controllers.  But he didn‚Äôt and the courts are now emboldened to invent obstacles to laws, regulations and enforcement actions, knowing there‚Äôs no downside except reversal by higher courts, which bothers them not at all.Some states have systems under which judges must be ‚Äúreconfirmed‚Äù by the voters periodically in retention elections.  This sometimes works‚Äìin Iowa three supreme court justices who had voted to makke homosexual marriage lawful via ‚Äúconstitutional interpretation‚Äù lost their positions in the next election.  but there is no check whatsoever on federal judges, save impeachment.  The last U.S. Supreme Court justice impeached (Samuel Chase¬∞ was in the Thomas Jefferson Administration and Jefferson characterized the impeachment threat as a ‚Äúscarecrow.‚ÄùMark Steyn, whose defamation case in the courts of the District of Columbia has been dragging on for years, has noted that Americans are particularly inclined to defer to judges.  This is all the more bizarre because in the United States, judges are lawyers whose politiccal connections put them in black robes.  In Europe, there is often a separate track for the training of jurists, although these courts are increasingly influenced by the American example and are becomig more ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and activist.  The Steyn case is illustrative in another sense, in that, while the courts are active in implementing their own political and social agenda, they cannot try and dispose of ordinary cases.  Almost any commercial contract calls for dispute resolution by arbitration; anyone who can avoids the courts!Sadly, aside from a constitutional convention that completely rewrites the constitution, including the role of the judiciary, I see no way out.  Well, maybe a Pinochet, which is where I think we‚Äôre headed anyway.

            Had Trump defied the Fed Judge ruling, we‚Äôd now be bitching about President Pence.  It‚Äôs just that simple.  We need to stop conflating Federal law requirements and impeachment requirements. Impeachment is purely a political act and based on what the opposition can get away with at the time.  The Trump opposition has spent the entire length of Trump‚Äôs presidency looking for an excuse.  Trump has deftly avoided giving them one.

                In 2017 the Republican Party controlled the House of Representatives and Trump was a newly sworn-in president.  The chance of a House impeachment then were practically nil.  And the Senate was also controlled by the Republican Party, so getting a two-thirds vote to remove Trump from office were less than impeachment in the first place.And if a president is going to be impeached and removed from office, it would be better if it was on a matter of high principle (‚ÄúWho run Bartertown?‚Äù).  If Congress wants to make the courts superior to the president in matters of border control, well, at least we would know where we stood.

            Of course it‚Äôs a moot point now because Trump has never done anything on any issue. But, early on he could have let it be known to the Supreme Court through back channels that he would defy an order on some issue that he thought important enough. The threat may have failed and Trump would have then either had to defy the order or give in. However, there is a very good chance that the SC would have backed down to save face. If they rule in Trump‚Äôs favor, then the Supreme Court‚Äôs power and prestige remains intact because they officially gave Trump permission. They would know that if Trump defied the SC and got away with it, it would be like exposing the Wizard of Oz.

It‚Äôs amazing that we just turned over the keys to the entire educational system to Marxists.

            Geezus Kryste.Public funded and run education in this country run by Marxists goes a lot further back than the 1960s.One of the planks of Communism ‚Äì is the takeover of education ‚Äì and the infestation of education by Marxists.That task was made easy in the US by Horace Mann:‚Äù About Mann‚Äôs intellectual progressivism, the historian Ellwood P. Cubberley said:No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian endsArguing that universal public education was the best way to turn unruly American children into disciplined, judicious republican citizens, Mann won widespread approval from modernizers, especially in the Whig Party, for building public schools ‚ÄùSo Horace Mann took those ‚Äúunruly children‚Äù and made them into obedient little ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù.   This made the job far easier for the Marxists ‚Äì because all they have to do is take over the mechanisms that are already in place to produce compliant little drones.Just change the inputs a little ‚Äì and out come millions of little Marxists.

        Listening to the Ben Shapiro show, three things struck me:  1) he is an outright enemy, not just a cuck; 2) I know I shouldn‚Äôt be but I am amazed at how coordinated the ‚Äúmedia‚Äù is with this white supremacist garbage, hot take:  this is going to backfire big time; and 3) this is not going to hold for much longer.  The mask has dropped, it used to be that the left would hint at things, etc., but they‚Äôve really lost it.  There are no pretenses anymore.  If you support Trump you must be ‚Äúeradicated‚Äù per a CNN guy on Twitter.   It‚Äôs actually kind of scary to see this happen so fast.  That‚Äôs been the oligarchs major problem.  They‚Äôve moved way too fast too harshly left.  It has backfired in Europe and it‚Äôs going to backfire in a big way here.  Just wait until people actually start reading the facts for once, the entire 20th century has been one big lie from start to finish‚Ä¶

            I was thinking the same thing, unfortunately.
When the authorities can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt enforce the law, historically people took the law into their own hands.  Vigilante justice out of necessity.
We‚Äôre in a low-level civil war right now and I can see death squads targeting individuals or specific political groups rather than innocent people going about their daily business.  I‚Äôm thinking of James Hodginkson, the Bernie Bro who shot up the Republican baseball game and nearly killed Steven Scalise, and Anders Brevik, who killed 77, 69 of whom who were attendees at a Workers Youth League summer camp.

            As everyone from Coulter to Greg Johnson to Mike Enoch keep warning, if you shut down legitimate means of dissent, the more psychologically fragile dissidents will start cracking, wig-nat style.  For the Fed-Stasi, that‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.  We‚Äôre going to have to work double-time to police our own ranks ala Johnson‚Äôs admonisments at C-C re: this weekend‚Äôs nutters, but I‚Äôll throw in a caveat that Greg left unsaid.  Communites can provide the support that potential lone wolves need to get their heads right rather than leaving them atomized to snap alone under the deliberate psy-opping of globo-Schlomo.  Before we ‚Äúcall the cops‚Äù as Greg recommends, let‚Äôs try a preventative approach that asks nothing more of us than giving the better among these guys someplace to call home and someone to call a friend.

        Your BLAZING HOT WHITEPILL of the day.   There is a fascinating Daily Caller article about the Amish.  In literally 220 years, if everything remains as is, the Amish population will EQUAL the entire current population of the United States.    That‚Äôs right.  It‚Äôs the grain of rice on the chess board.  In 1900 there were roughly 6,000 Amish.  Today, it‚Äôs close to 350,000.  Their birth rates and retention rates have remained rock solid for over 100 years.  If they remain so, the future truly does belong to the Amish!

                    The thing is, the tech will go away  . Some of it is already crumbling around us.Below replacement fertility means as natural or hell unnatural death takes people, new  people don‚Äôt replace them . EverWe‚Äôve had roughly 50 years of below replacement fertility and if it weren‚Äôt for mass immigration we‚Äôd be entering a decline rather shortly3x this long means  a serious population decline and those stats as noted means almost no one left isn‚Äôt of those categoriesif the largest group is Amish, who precisely is going to keep a complex tech base alive ? They won‚Äôt be maintaining or using much of it.Most of the rest of the people might want it and there certainly could be some regions with a higher tech base but its resource and the will to get at them drivenAlso it‚Äôs not like we have limitless resources, in a couple of centuries oil and possibly easy to extract and use coal will be a thing of the pastFewer people who understand tech and with a large population who don‚Äôt want it means a much lower tech society.Its called catabolic collapseI would not assume motorcars in 200 years and trains might quite rare,

However, I‚Äôll take my chances with the Amish average IQ well over the imported sub 70 IQ Somalis the democrats are so found of.   In literally two more generations, the Amish will be a sizeable portion of 3 entire states.  Ohio will remain deep blood red and PA will finally become more reliable than FL in the red column.

                            I don‚Äôt know what the average IQ of the typical Amish is, but I‚Äôve read that they have some serious genetic inbreeding problems/diseases.  If, and I don‚Äôt know this specifically, they suffer from closeness resembling (effectively) the Pakistani cousin marriages problem in ME and UK, then don‚Äôt expect technical savvy or even average IQ.  Much of their survival success may be that they scrape the land for their livelihood, with the most primitive means known.That being said, they may not be the group to lead back into the light, but rather the group to show us how to survive in the dark (ages).  üôÅ

I‚Äôm far from it and am completely fine with population decline so long as the demography is  favorable. The US would be better with half the current population
Pointing out we‚Äôd have decline without immigration is a value neutral statement.

        As usual ‚Äì you and a good many of the people who frequent the comment section are off ‚Äì by DECADES ‚Äì on when the rot set in.Delayed reaction ‚Äì that‚Äôs the term of the day.Seems I have to keep posting this:https://mises.org/library/revolution-wasThere are those who still think they are holding the pass against a revolution that may be coming up the road. But they are gazing in the wrong direction. The revolution is behind them. It went by in the Night of Depression, singing songs to freedom.There are those who have never ceased to say very earnestly, ‚ÄúSomething is going to happen to the American form of government if we don‚Äôt watch out.‚Äù These were the innocent disarmers. Their trust was in words. They had forgotten their Aristotle. More than 2,000 years ago he wrote of what can happen within the form, when ‚Äúone thing takes the place of another, so that the ancient laws will remain, while the power will be in the hands of those who have brought about revolution in the state.‚ÄùWorse outwitted were those who kept trying to make sense of the New Deal from the point of view of all that was implicit in the American scheme, charging it therefore with contradiction, fallacy, economic ignorance, and general incompetence to govern.But it could not be so embarrassed, and all that line was wasted, because, in the first place, it never intended to make that kind of sense, and secondly, it took off from nothing that was implicit in the American scheme.It took off from a revolutionary base. *The design was European. Regarded from the point of view of revolutionary technique, it made perfect sense. Its meaning was revolutionary and it had no other.* For what it meant to do, it was from the beginning consistent in principle, resourceful, intelligent, masterly in workmanship, and it made not one mistake.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThe bug was inserted into the Republic during the 1930‚Äôs.   You can go AT LEAST that far back.  I‚Äôd argue that the decay started in the early 1900‚Äôs when features of the Republic like the militia system were co-opted,  the Federal Reserve was instituted to enable that later-to-come out of control welfare state communistic government ‚Äì and people like Woodrow Wilson got us involved in WW1 ‚Äì in direct contradiction to the advice given by the founders of this country ‚Äì and over the original structure of that Republic which was supposed to keep that from happening.The growth of empire started well before ‚Äúafter WW2‚Äù.  And empire is in direct opposition to the intent of the Republic as founded.  It‚Äôs also directly in opposition to any sort of ‚Äúwhite state‚Äù ‚Äì as the people running things don‚Äôt give two shits about who they rule over ‚Äì they just want to rule.   If it was any other way ‚Äì then we (and other empires) would have never gone around the world looking for countries full of brown people to take over.You‚Äôll NEVER fix this problem unless you get your shit straight on where the problem emanates from in the first place.

                Yes , but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  much of the increase in Federal government was rolled back after the Civil War.   The milita system in particular ‚Äì still existed and didn‚Äôt become the ‚ÄúNational Guard‚Äù until 1903 or something like that.You see ‚Äì this is why I keep referring back to Garet Garret‚Äôs ‚ÄúRevolution Was‚Äù ‚Äì and in particular his comment of ‚Äúrevolution within the form‚Äù.Once CONTROl of the militia transitioned over to the Federal government ‚Äì we no longer had the same ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù system ‚Äì no matter how hard they continue to try and propagandize that we do.The militia was banned from use overseas if I remember correctly.  The National Guard was most distinctly NOT ‚Äì and was used in overseas adventures ever since then.One of the complaints I do remember reading that was lodged against the militia system at the time the ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù were trying to manipulate the country into being an engine of empire ‚Äì was that the miltia had degenerated into a bunch of clubs.  What they wanted were military age cannon fodder to staff their armies of empire ‚Äì not a bunch of clubs operating under the aegis of a militia ‚Äì whose members would not be inclined to engage in overseas wars.I suppose you are correct ‚Äì in that roots of decay go all the way back to the Civil War era.  Except that it seems like the decay dial was turned up to 11 after the turn of the 20th century.I‚Äôve also seen it written that the average American citizen‚Äôs exposure to the Federal government in circa 1890 ‚Äì was limited to the Post Office delivering their mail.25 years later ‚Äì that world was completely changed.  And it has only gotten worse since then.But the FDR era was what truly laid the ground for the modern welfare state that we currently live in.  Which is why I think we need to go back *at least* that far.And it‚Äôs also why I think that much of the comment section here is made of FDR dick lickers ‚Äì who are only pissed off about the fact that the darkies are horning in on their left wing welfare/warfare state ‚Äì which was set in motion in the 1960s.That‚Äôs why they‚Äôll only go back that far.  Going back any further calls into question their entire notion of American ‚Äúempire‚Äù.You can have empire ‚Äì or you can have Republic (as founded) ‚Äì but you can‚Äôt have both.Empire DEMANDS inclusion of darkies ‚Äì and always has.  As soon as you start conquering them ‚Äì you own them. You break it ‚Äì you bought it.This is why I think the people who will only go back to the 60‚Äôs are damn fools.  They‚Äôre actually responsible for this mess.

                    Pinpointing the start is tricky. I‚Äôd say the groundwork for Empire was laid, intentionally or not, in 1789 with the implementation of the Constitution.  Then the 1848 socialist revolution failed in Germany and many fled here settling above the Mason Dixon. After the war(‚Äúthe second founding ‚Äú), things settled down but the Bill of Rights was flipped to apply to states. Meanwhile (((Eastern European ))) immigrants began arriving in large numbers and taking over the Democratic Party and things began accelerating :WWII, desegregation,  Hart Cellar,  etc. Its a long, sad story.The Iron Curtain Over America is an interesting book on WWII available free online.  Also Lincoln‚Äôs Marxists is still available on Amazon.

                    Do you REALLY think the regular commenters on here are FDR lovers?
THere has been nothing to support that statement. What makes you say that?
When I read Diana West‚Äôs book called ‚ÄúAmerican Betrayal‚Äù, I learned much more about FDR, Lend-Lease, Commie infiltration of the White House, etc.I was never a huge fan of the guy (some then-unknown instinct told me he wasn‚Äôt the best‚Ä¶), but after learning more about him: Yikes.
From that time on (about 2015), I have only referred to him as a schmuck. And that‚Äôs being kind.

                    Good point.  Most of the blacks in the North,  originate from the South.
So I suppose you could directly trace the root of the problem directly back to the forced inclusion of the Confederates back into the ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù.

            The Old Republic began to die with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Our Constitution was written by and for a largely agrarian society with a small number of merchants and very little in the way of manufacturing. By the time of the Civil War, our country was simply a different nation composed of powerful, wealthy individuals whose interests were no longer aligned with those of individual states and landholders or vice versa. Once the merchant class had the bit between its teeth, all the issues of modernism flooded behind, probably of necessity. Democracy on a gigantic scale and the modern industrial state are not compatible with our Founders‚Äô notions of civil society. We‚Äôve put in place all the mechanisms for tyranny and should not be surprised to find out that we‚Äôve been living in one for quite some time.

        The courts were a mess by the time Griswold vs. CT came out.  If you really want to see a Supreme Court decision that was a five alarm fire, check out:  Schlecter Poultry Corp. Vs the United States,1935.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.L.A._Schechter_Poultry_Corp._v._United_StatesAlso, check out Wickard vs. Filburn, 1942,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._FilburnThose two cases were a one-two punch that brought down the historical relationship between the Federal Govt. and the governed.  People forget that for most of our history the Federal Govt. only stepped into problems when two or more states were at loggerheads over something, as designed by the constitution.  With these decisions the gates were wide open for any politician at the Federal level to create anything in law and it would be perfectly legal, right down to Obamacare today.  The states may as well be an assortment of counties in a superstate.In a superstate, where the Federal Govt. regulates everything from the number of endangered frogs in a pond to grandpa‚Äôs diuretic, there‚Äôs simply not enough time in the day for a bunch of octogenarian Senators to remove judges in the impeachment process.  They‚Äôre wiped out by 3:00, and most of those Senators were elected on the promises made legal due to these two pieces of cases law.  They have no incentive anyway.

        Here is an extreme analogy that may be helpful. Imagine that a small asteroid strikes the earth and throws a lot of dust into the atmosphere which causes a global winter for several years (this has actually happened long before our species evolved). Now, what is the likelihood that we will be able to maintain our current standard of living? Will being highly skilled at whining increase your chances of survival? We have bad judges because we have bad voters because we live in an environment that degrades the species rather than elevates it.

        Guns could be the flashpoint issue, frankly.  Revolts do not occur when the people are distracted and their bellies are full.  They just don‚Äôt or very very rarely.
Thinking long and hard about things, the gun issue is one in which you might actually see some REAL pushback.  Gun culture is like a cult.   These guys do not screw around.
Now they got the AWB through the first time way back when in the ‚Äô90s, but much has become different now.   Just spitballin but on this one I think there could be some real pushback.

            The defense of the Second Amendment is one of the only two successful conservative causes.  To a lesser degree, the prolifers succeeded in restricting abortion in a number of states.  On all others, there was a fighting retreat, but still a retreat.

        This is such an important issue that, in order to spread awareness of it, we have to have a term that encapsulates the meaning of the problem for normies, and is catchy and easy to remember.
The technical term for rule by judges is ‚Äúkritarchy,‚Äù but normie ain‚Äôt going to use or remember something so alien sounding.
Our phrasemakers need to channel the spirit of Sailer and Derbyshire for a good coinage or rehabilitation. Something along the lines of ‚Äújudicial tyranny,‚Äù ‚Äúrogue judges,‚Äù ‚Äúgangster judges‚Äù‚Ä¶

            You‚Äôre over-thinking it.  Kritarchy may not be an every day word, but it‚Äôs a single term, most would tend to remember it because it‚Äôs so different, and it starts with the same hard ‚Äúc‚Äù as cuck.  It‚Äôs a good word and, even as stupid and ignorant as most normiecons are, they can be made to stretch their tiny little minds occasionally.

        The Constitution is just a rationalization device and it has been this way for many decades.Even the framing of this issue is bad. The judge ruled that citizens don‚Äôt need semi-automatic long guns for self defense. We will notice that self-defense is not mentioned in the Second Amendment.There is another case that is a bit more illustrative and that is Maryland V Craig (https://www.oyez.org/cases/1989/89-478) where the court decided that an enumerated right we clearly had does not exist. Then there is Wickard V Filburn, where the courts decided there was no limit to government regulation.The entire judicial system is designed to weed out people who won‚Äôt play ball. In most cases, you must be a lawyer to become a judge and in most cases, you need to attend university to become a lawyer. Then you need to pass the Bar and pass a pretty intrusive background check. Once you are admitted, they have their ‚Äúethics‚Äù standards with which they can disbar you at any time.  This system creates a lot of opportunity to completely control the judicial system.  This is why there is not a single right winger on the Supreme Court.

        Note to posterity: If you decide to have another try at representative government with a formal Constitution, you need to establish certain rules as absolute. E.g. ‚Äúmarriage is between a man and a woman‚Äù, ‚Äúfree love is not a right‚Äù, ‚Äúall men have the right to own and carry guns‚Äù (whether or not they are members of a ‚Äúwell-ordered militia‚Äù), ‚Äúwomen can‚Äôt vote‚Äù, etc. Furthermore, key points need to be underlined with, ‚ÄúIf any judge discovers an exception to this rule, his or her life is forfeit. Whosoever maims or kills said judge has committed no crime.‚ÄùTruth is eternal, but every era has its own set of fashionable falsehoods. Thus will wise men writing a Constitution in the 22nd century armor it well against the insanity of the 21st, but be hard-pressed to anticipate the perversions of the 24th.

                All republics suffer the temptation to expand the franchise, as it is hoped that the new voters will reward the party that made them voters. One remedy for this is the Prussian system of sorting voters into upper, middle, and lower classes such that each class provides 1/3 of total tax revenue, and giving each class equal representation in government, with no representation for people who don‚Äôt pay taxes. If Warren Buffet pays 1/3 of all tax revenue in Nebraska, he gets to hand-pick 1/3 of Nebraska‚Äôs allotted representatives.Government employees and contractors don‚Äôt pay taxes, they receive taxes, and they don‚Äôt need representation in government because they *are* government. People who make goods for the government shall not by considered government if they sell the same goods (e.g. guns) to the general public.It‚Äôs more complicated in places that, unlike 19th-century Prussia, have multiple ethnic groups capable of paying taxes. Perhaps the Chinese, Indians, and Jews should be allowed to elect their own governments that negotiate with the white government as to where they will be allowed to reside and what professions will be open to them (e.g. let Jews be doctors, dentists, and jewelers, but keep them out of media and education). Multi-ethnic republics have always been unstable and short-lived.

                    You‚Äôre avoiding the obvious issue of race.  What if non-whites are significantly more tribal and stupid?  Do you want to allow them to immigrate and vote like non-whites?
Sure government employees are parasites.  But they are not in the same cognitive category as blacks and Amerindians.  C‚Äômon.
Why are you working so hard to allow blacks and Amerindians to have a vote that counts as much as yours?

                    I can‚Äôt really blame anyone for that. The modern level of prosperity is a gilded cage and a lot of people even on our side don‚Äôt have future descendants to fight for or really any idea what kind of alternative they want anyway.Its very hard to sell ‚Äúmake divorce harder, ban porn, dry up the drug supply, control imports.‚Äù to people unless they can see that these actions would make for meaningful improvements in their lifeOf the issues that can get people fired up there is abortion, guns and to a lesser degree immigration. IMO anyway the last ought to be job one, guns job 2 and abortion? Well,it‚Äôs a religious issue and not amenable to rational discussion.Our situation is also  complicated by the fact the US isn‚Äôt as religious as it once was . We are far more religious than say Sweden but even among the broader Right , religion is far from a major thing.or a common languageI‚Äôm not religious at all for example and my world view isn‚Äôt Christian. I‚Äôm hardly likely to  fight for the Deus Vult crowd, it‚Äôs not in my interestTrying to put together a Post Christian USA would be damned hard since Post Christians mostly are simply not religious and lack the religious impulse to get ‚Äòer doneOf those that do , they are uniformly Leftists which makes things harder stillIn the end, the system isn‚Äôt ready to change anyway. Its eroding at a terrifying rate but as Adam Smith once said ‚ÄúThere is plenty of ruin in a nation.‚ÄùSo best to get good, get hard , get equipped get ready and most importantly  get friends .

        Patrick Crusius Manifesto: The Inconvenient Truth (an excerpt):About MeIn general, I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto. This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas. They are the instigators, not me. I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion. Some people will think this statement is hypocritical because of the nearly complete ethnic and cultural destruction brought to the Native Americans by our European ancestors, but this just reinforces my point. The natives didn‚Äôt take the invasion of Europeans seriously, and now what‚Äôs left is just a shadow of what was. My motives for this attack are not at all personal. Actually the Hispanic community was not my target before I read The Great Replacement‚Ä¶.Political ReasonsIn short, America is rotting from the inside out, and peaceful means to stop this seem to be nearly impossible. The inconvenient truth is that our leaders, both Democrat AND Republican, have been failing us for decades. They are either complacent or involved in one of the biggest betrayals of the American public in our history‚Ä¶.but here is what is important‚Ä¶.America will soon become a one party-state. The Democrat party will own America and they know it. They have already begun the transition by pandering heavily to the Hispanic voting bloc in the 1st Democratic Debate. They intend to use open borders, free healthcare for illegals, citizenship and more to enact a political coup by importing and then legalizing millions of new voters. With policies like these, the Hispanic support for Democrats will likely become nearly unanimous in the future. The heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold. Losing Texas and a few other states with heavy Hispanic population to the Democrats is all it would take for them to win nearly every presidential election‚Ä¶.Personal Reasons and ThoughtsMy whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn‚Äôt exist. The job of my dreams will likely be automated. Hispanics will take control of the local and state government of my beloved Texas, changing policy to better suit their needs. They will turn Texas into an instrument of a political coup which will hasten the destruction of our country. The environment is getting worse by the year. If you take nothing else from this document, remember this: INACTION IS A CHOICE. I can no longer bear the shame of inaction knowing that our founding fathers have endowed me with the rights needed to save our country from the brink destruction‚Ä¶..America can only be destroyed from the inside-out. If our country falls, it will be the fault of traitors. This is why I see my actions as faultless. Because this isn‚Äôt an act of imperialism but an act of preservation‚Ä¶..My ideology has not changed for several years. My opinions on automation, immigration, and the rest predate Trump and his campaign for president. I putting this here because some people will blame the President or certain presidential candidates for the attack. This is not the case. I know that the media will probably call me a white supremacist anyway and blame Trump‚Äôs rhetoric. The media is infamous for fake news. Their reaction to this attack will likely just confirm that‚Ä¶..https://grabancijas.com/patrick-crusius-manifesto-the-inconvenient-truth/(Read the whole thing:  this manifesto doesn‚Äôt read like like the paranoid delusions of a crazy person, but those of an angry and desperate, but mostly lucid young man who doesn‚Äôt believe he has much of a future.  And is he wrong?  There‚Äôs a seemingly inevitable, John Brown-like feel to the violence that we‚Äôre being sucked into.)

                    Mass murder without purpose like  killing a bunch of people  at a Walmart is evil and stupid.The problem lies at the level of the leadershipI can‚Äôt  endorse illegal acts  , Breivik unlike this moron at least understood the problem space and attacked the source, i.e the next generation of his enemiesThe reason  for this is Breivik was culturally farther left and understood the basic idea of collective responsibility , goal setting and suchThe Right is too individualistic to have a group goal, to act to that goal and to even understand the group think of the other side well enough to counter it.If they weren‚Äôt  soy boys and girls, Antifa would be a far more formidable fighting force  than the Right since they have cohesion and a common, if stupid set of goals.Being soy people they may not last without amenable authority to cover for them but in truth Reds can  be hella scary and underestimating them is a mistakeMainly the Right just whine  leave me alone and makes threats that basically never come to fruition.Maybe there is some discussion of what the heck do we want in meatspace I am not privy to but if there isn‚Äôt, well join or die

        I‚Äôm in favor of gun control.  The answer to these attacks to stop potential mass murders from getting weapons of the power of an AK47.  That deranged young man in Florida should never have been able to amass an arsenal of that power in so short a time.  Why do people need firearms like that?  It ought to be very difficult to own a firearm.  This would solve so many problems.  This one issue I‚Äôm with the leftists on.

                    Under the proper as intended  interpretation of the Constitution , the US does not have a standing army only a sizable standing Nazy, some of whom are trained MarinesActual national Defense is from well regulated, that is properly equipped and trained civilians who would be armed with military hardware.Back in the day armed warships were privately owned and prior to the NFA, a private attack aircraft would be perfectly legal though some states restricted explosive ordnance .Given the cost of modern military hardware, 10 million for an Abrams tank, likely State governments would end up with most of them in the various state   national guards whose job would be to guard the nation from outside interferenceThe big difference is that the proper US is isolationist and would not have bases everywhere ro engage in warfare except if attacked or against piratesWe probably would not be a major or nuclear power though we‚Äôd be well off and very very WhiteAs for the more current  missiles,  I suspect that no one would sell these to civilians and that the Department of the Navy would own themGiven they are  many millions each, the cost alone deters private ownershipHowever if there were nukes, we would by Constitutional amendment declare they are not allowed to be sold thus lawfully solving the issue,

            Mass shootings aren‚Äôt new.  Even in 1927 some guy in Michigan wiped out over 40 kids in a schoolhouse.  They were rare, because anyone who did that knew he would be swiftly executed.  Today the ones that survive languish in cells while they see psychiatrists on the taxpayer dime.  Throw pharmaceuticals into the mix, and a deteriorating culture on top of that, that‚Äôs what you get.

            Here is an answer that you may not like. If you take away firearms (which are in the vast majority of cases used for hunting and self defense), then people will find other ways to defend themselves (both against criminals and a rogue government). And you will not like those other ways as they will be much more surreptitious and deadly than an AK-47. Are you sure you want to start an arms race in personal protection devices in this era of cheap high tech materials and parts? What if the thing that kills isn‚Äôt a bullet or even visible?

                        Dear Gun Grabber.  It is my firm belief, that in order to stop not just gun violence, but all human violence what so ever. We should immediately petition the federal government in the strongest possible terms to begin a massive research project to discover a process, whereby all of humanity can be transformed into butterflys. So there ya go Mr. Grabber, problem solved.

                        Karl is usually a well thought out commentator on this site, so I must ask him,‚ÄùHow do you post what you posted, and use the examples cited wrt gun violence? ‚ÄúDo you not understand the basic principles discussed here repeatedly wrt HBD science?  If you ignore HBD principles, then you will never understand how Brazil can be similar to USA (overall) in gun violence.You must rethink and try to understand at least two things:  1) mass shootings as per this week are rare and account for less than 1% of death by firearms in the USA, and 2) remove the minority population from those statistics, and the remaining White population in USA have gun violence stat‚Äôs resembling any of the ideal European countries you cite.A similar argument can be made and has been shown for the subpar scoring of USA students on international educational achievement tests (PISA).

            This is particularly low-grade trolling. Zero stars.

            LOL.You can‚Äôt even understand simple things like what the term ‚Äúarsenal‚Äù means ‚Äì you expect anybody who understands this issue to respect your opinion?Here‚Äôs a question you should answer:Why is it that every single time somebody starts blathering on about how guns are the problem ‚Äì their words flow as if they just copied them from a textbook passage somewhere.Does whomever is pulling your strings just hand out index cards with pre-approved words and phrases to use when discussing this subject?It‚Äôs people like you that have brought the majority of the pro-gun crowd to the point where they just summarily dismiss any and all ‚Äúarguments‚Äù coming out of the anti-gun left.It‚Äôs become so blaringly apparent that the vast majority of anti-gunners are just indoctrinated fools that they don‚Äôt see the point in even debating any more.  They just (instantly) fall back on ‚Äù Fuck off ‚Äì come get them‚Äù type responses.The truth of the matter is that the use of a long gun makes up a very small percent of the weapons used in the overall murders committed in this country on any given year.  This is all logged in intimate detail by FBI crime stats,  so it should be undisputable by anybody who cares to look at actual reality.The actual cause of most murders in this country ‚Äì is one that lefties will contort themselves around any and all obstacles to try and avoid addressing.  So I‚Äôm sure you will as well.Any person who deems themselves a white nationalist ‚Äì who admits they are in favor of gun control is either a moron ‚Äì or a liar (about their white nationalism).

            There are two over-riding reasons to own guns: to shoot anyone who 1.) breaks into your house or 2.) comes to take your guns.
