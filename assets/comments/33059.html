        Biden’s quick jaunt to Peru perfectly illustrates the so-called elite’s deliberate malign neglect of  “the homeland”.  The AdMin, in its infinite wisdom and makeshift jjiggery that now passes for diplomacy, offered Peru a rail transport system to compete with the brand new deep water port China is building there. Not to be outdone in showing good will, the US offered an entire set of USED CalTrans trains that happened to be sitting in the second hand junk yard. Nothing like sending one’s hand-me-downs!  But more to the point, you can be sure one of Gavin’s pals pocketed some dough on this embarrassing scheme and will be sending a generous donation to his future presidential campaign.In a similar vain, it turns out Al Sharpton requested a 500K donation to his foundation in exchange for supporting Kamala. One would have thought he’d have done it for free. The US has skipped falling through second world practices and moved straight to Ugandan levels of corruption.

        “ Everything close to home is ignored in favor of distant ventures on the periphery of the empire. Policy makers in Washington think more about infrastructure in Ukraine than in the United States. ”As I’ve stated previously, this is not simply “oversight”. It is a “feature” and desired.  The closer to home such actions are designed to take effect, the easier they can be observed and judged as to their proposed success.For example, one can pass a bill to fund rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine and have it stolen by the oligarchs and rapacious companies in the US far easier than one can pass a bill to modernize ports in the US and steal such funding here.  On the other hand, one must note that our present rulers have been pretty successful here at home with such bills as the “Inflation Reduction Act”.  So perhaps my analysis is dated.   🙁

            Yes indeed, Compsci.
It is a feature. It’s why they love proposing remedies for the “climate emergency”, as there is no real way to ever determine the success of such remedies.
Success is whatever they say it is.
Lord have mercy.

                Exactly correct.
All the, “War on Nebulous Target,” schemes mean infinite funding with no responsibility for results.
Infinite funding means infinite grifting.

                I remember noticing this when Obama was trying to pass tax increases “on the rich”, which he got through. Literally nothing changed in any way, at all. There was no more money for dem programz, no more resources to make the country better, it didn’t change the economic structure of the USA at all, it didn’t help with income inequality, it was just more money that may or may not have gone into the maw. Whenever I see a liberal talk about muh 90% tax rates during the Kennedy years, I point out that the feds take in the same amount of money today (as a percentage of GDP) as they did back then, and they never like hearing it. It’s the fiscal version of “nothing ever happens”.I will say that DC did seem really, really angry about sequestration, I actually saw an op-ed mention it the other day (first time I heard that word in a very long time!). Of course it didn’t really have any effect on what the feds did or did not do, it was probably just a wee bit tougher to skim off the top.

                    I’m supportive of high progressive tax rates for one reason, income inequality in the 50s as compared to now. As far as I can tell, the tax rates are the major difference from then to now. If it helps reverse income inequality, then that’s good enough for me. Besides that, it would hit the people who have financialized the economy the hardest.
It’s my hope that eventually wages will go up enough so that a one-income household becomes the norm again. That would solve a lot of problems that we’re inflicted with now.

                        The reason for our mass inequality today as compared to the 1950s isn’t the tax rates imo, it is feminism and mass immigration. Feminism effectively doubled the workforce, and allowed companies to keep pay low under the assumption that both the husband and wife will be working to maintain the household. The elites crushed the value of a blue collar career by importing tens of millions of third worlders to compete against everyone without a college degree. Now they are trying to do it to the people with college degrees.

                    I’m much more concerned about government spending rather than tax rates.  Back in the 60’s India reformed itself when government spending hit 20% of GDP.  Today the Fed’s account for 20-25% of the GDP with State and local coming in at an additional 10-15%!
This bodes poorly.  Not only for efficiency, but for freedom from the “nanny state”.

        “a product of the American foreign policy machinery, which produces these figures on demand.”
As you say, there’s always someone who went up to Oxford, or Harvard, or Yale, who cleans up well in a suit and tie waiting for the revolution that never comes.
The Karzai family (Hamid, President of Afghanistan) ran a top-notch Afghan restaurant in Cambridge MA. Maybe they still do.

        This is why the counter elite supports Trump. Latin America full stop is filled with strategic resources that the US in the new cold war must have domination over: lithium, uranium, oil, copper, iron ore, etc. As well as rare earth metals, and other things like food and cotton.The world is breaking up into trading blocs, and its driven by both counter elite oligarchs and elements of the managerial state who see defense slipping away under social spending going to 100% of the budget in immavasion, and the old boutique military failing spectacularly in Ukraine and Yemen.Prince is trying fluff and buff his way into more bucks for a private military. Shades of Sir Francis Drake. Nothing new there.What is needed is a massive build up of the US Navy, which requires also massive deportations to cut social welfare spending, in order to dominate South America. This will also require a massive build up of the Marines Expeditionary Force, and US Army forces capable of supporting that sort of thing as well. The days of Paramilitary Action deposing rulers we don’t like is over. As is the idea of Special Forces Olympics: Iraq post 2008, Afghanistan, Syria etc. SCALE is what is needed, when everyone has decent air defense missiles and artillery.It seems like the Trump Counter Elite are going to cut their losses in Ukraine, possibly Taiwan, and focus on Latin America. As gay, diverse America just does not have the resources to play global policeman. As that drastically reduces the risk of global nuclear war, I’m ok with that. Trump was never going to be peaceful nirvana, just a re-ordering into sanity.Related: see the Jaguar commercial. Its Marketing Director is more “flamboyant” than the late Richard Simmons and the late Liberace combined.

        There may be sveral things going on at once:1. Maduro did quite openly steal the 2024 election.  He didn’t win it honestly; he had to have his thugs seize the ballots and then ignore the local vote counts.2. His opponent almost certainly is U.S.-supported.3. Our regime is not actually a monolith, however much it may seem like one to unimportant dissidents like we posting here.  There is a faction in the current U.S. government that’s been appalled by the disastrous consequences of America’s 2020 election fraud, and who tried to intervene in Venezuela 2024 as a warm-up for America 2024.4. *Somebody* on the evening of Nov. 5th, 2024 managed to block what was supposed to be yet another ‘fortified’ election.  Which, if true, would explain why Merrick Garland started Nov. 5th grinning like a chimp and ended it crying like a baby.Can I prove any of these hypotheses?  No.  Are they consistent with the amazing events we’ve been observing lately?  Yes.  Will our political life as Americans ever stop being a miasmatic snake pit of “trust me bro” guesswork by soreheaded nobodies like myself?  I devoutly hope so, but it’d be foolish to expect any such future with certainty.

            TPTB pulled out of the 2024 fraud about 10 days prior.  That’s what the WaPost non endorsement of Harris was about.  They couldn’t close the fraud margin gap and shifted to down ballot fraud.
Garland is probably like a lot of Democrats who drank their own bath water on the polling.  Garland would never be told about fraud.  His job is just to not investigate it when it happens.

                I don’t follow that they couldn’t close the fraud margin. Looking at the turnout, they very well could have. Trump didn’t come anywhere close to Biden’s numbers. Yet, anyway. Counting votes evidently takes a really, really long time. Anyhow, to be ‘too big to rig,’ it would have had to be a lot bigger than it has been. GA, WI, MI, NV were all plenty close enough for fraud to have switched them if that was the goal. Maybe PA and NC too. Probably not AZ, making Gallego’s victory all the more questionable.I have this notion that they had to keep Lake out of the senate at all costs because of some procedural thing about recess appointments.

                    But you have to remember that Biden did not get 81M votes and could not have received that many votes without COVID lockdowns.  Structurally, they could not do what they did in 2020 without getting caught.  There’s no chance they wheel in 100,000 votes at 3am this time around.  Attempts at fraud in PA were quickly shut down by judges – like the “election protectors” sending people home who were standing in line and the people in Bucks County trying to count illegal ballots and then bragging about it.Unlike last time, various groups had people inside the ballot tabulation centers specifically watching for mystery ballots and there would be no ability to send them home.  In 2020 in PA, my aunt was an election observer in Bucks County.  They were all sent home late in the day with the claim that “somebody tested positive for covid”.  Everyone went home, no observers, and things got crazy.None of that was possible this year.My hope is that Trump using his mandate to get Congress to pass legislation banning mail in voting and limiting early voting to the last 7 days.  If he can get that done, there will be blue states flipping red.

                        Fedguv doesn’t have jurisdiction over mail in ballots. It’s a state thing. Unless they can find a legal mechanism (a la the CRA) to insert themselves into state election law.

        Once the US intel-community writ large is done fixing the problem between Russia and Ukraine – it’s not clear if there’ll even be anything left to fix in this hemisphere.  And if there is, if I were living in any of those countries I’d be inclined to say thanks but no thanks to any US intel jug head offer of help to fix a pot hole, let alone anything of real importance.

        I don’t remember all the details and I’m too lazy to look it up, but if I remember correctly, the US government recognized the shadow puppet government of Venezuela after the last election. That shadow government authorized ownership of Citgo being stripped from Venezuela to settle a civil judgment in the United States courts.I don’t know all the details, but it seemed wrong to me on so many levels. Here we go again, abrogating property rights, which are the backbone of the US economy. Unlike other banana republics around the world, your assets were supposed to be safe here. Second of all, ownership of your personal property generally falls under the jurisdiction of courts where are you are considered a resident.We’re just shooting ourselves in the foot with this kind of short-sighted behavior. Once people stop trusting that their assets are safe in the United States, we lose our edge over the rest of the world when it comes to attracting capital.

        Latin America is simply not a top obsession of the tribe (as are Israel and Ukraine) nor does it play an important role in the US being the dominant global player. So the top priorities are Iran, Russia and China.
The only enthusiasm the GAE can seem to muster concerning LA are defeating Madero and Bukele and using unrest in LA to flood the US with invaders. so no downside.
Eventually China’s rise in LA will panic them but not until Iran is dealt with and they figure an exit from Ukraine

            I don’t think that the Tribe is that interested in China either. Neither the neocons nor The Lobby care that much. China is more a white guy obsession. This will be a coming fight. The neocons and The Lobby will want to keep the focus on the Middle East and Russia while the Pentagon will want to focus on China.

            Among my Jewish relatives who were “political” when I was a kid in the ’80s, Latin America was an obsession and source of family arguments.20th century communism was a Jewish cause, of course. Supporting it everywhere was a racial obligation (or a religious one if that rhetoric would work better). Latin American anti-communism was Jewish too, because “third worldism” is bad for business. The browns take Lenin too seriously. There’s no legalistic parsing of Marx in Managua. So a lot of valuable farm and ranch land was expropriated during leftist revolutions. That land belonged to…landowners. You’ll still find some families complaining about it, having retconned the revolution into an antisemitic pogrom, demanding restoration and reparations. All the world’s land is divinely apportioned, especially the vineyards. You know the story.I don’t know if the neocons care. America does show excess interest in specific countries there, but the things “we” do to them make no sense. It looks like interference for its own sake—or just to do crimes, like setting up a hunting preserve for mercs to play in. That’s not neocon style. They prioritize mass death.

        Printing fiat currency has kept the plates spinning for decades now, but debasement cannot continue forever. And those chickens will come home to roost starting later this year. Real hardship will return and only then can we begin to self-correct. And this repair can be fast or slow. Slow means prolonged misery before redemption. Faster is better, but it means the pathogens must go and than won’t be pretty. It has always been thus.

        Latin America and Brazil are close but very difficult to understand. Brazil is a huge, diverse place, they speak Portuguese and had a totally different colonial experience versus the others. LatAm is comprised of 16+ countries each with their own ethnic mix, industries, elites, political differences, not to mention historical grudges. Nobody in Washington is going to try to understand all this stuff (beyond the obvious interest in raking the cocaine/drug trade).During the Cold War, US banks lent loads of dollars to most of these countries. So we developed a banking class that understood these countries at least a little. Of course, these loans were huge losers. They were largely written off in the Bush HW administration (Brady Bonds anyone?). My generation (late boomer, early X) is really the last group that has had serious business contact with LatAm. A lot of the neglect is a product of ignorance/difficulty in understanding what’s going on down there. I have many friends/contacts there, speak Spanish, do business with them and still don’t understand very much about what’s happening. We should approach foreign policy with more humility.

        ‘Local neglect’ is an understatement.China has a strong foothold in Latin America.  In Costa Rica, for example, the Commies ‘gifted’ C.R. a shiny new sports stadium in San Jose, the capital city, and receives numerous concessions therefrom.  There are endless Chinese-operated supermarkets and stores throughout the nation.  It’s about establishing presence and intel, much more than a foot-in-the-door.The C.R. government is down with this.  The ticos?  Not so much.  Largely, they dislike the ‘chinas’.  Washington?  They’re too busy spreading wokeness, homosexuality, and feminism throughout the planet.  Priorities, doncha know.The Russian military camps out in Nicaragua, and the Russkies damn sure have much more than ‘advisors’ present, including at the southern border with Costa Rica.  But D.C. is far more interested in installing rainbow flags throughout Ukraine and Eastern Europe.  Western Europe already flies them.  Proudly.As Z notes, the Canal Zone already has been infiltrated by the Chinese.  Washington gradually is losing Central and South America.  The Beltway yawns and texts its insider-trading cronies for this week’s stock market grift, while the dollar plummets at foreign exchanges.The U.S. no longer is a serious country, and everybody knows it except Washington.

                The coming Jewish hapa overclass is the regime’s *other* fantasy.
It’s not really working out. Out of all the combinatorial possibilities, actual Jewish hapas tend toward “extremely goofy-looking psychological cripple,” not “articulate Keanu Reeves.” The girls come out better, usually, but women are commissars, not rulers.

                I wish I could say I’ve noticed the same thing, but I haven’t.  Black-white couples remain predominant.  The more ridiculous ones are those with fairly normal looking white men married to overweight black women.  As if!
Also, the “suave, successful, but non-threatening black man who is quite obviously cooler than the awkward, neurotic white man” genre is still going strong.

                I’ve not noticed such, but only see cable with ad’s.  What I have seen is the made for TV stuff that has obligatory mixed race sexual interaction scenes.  Then the next step down is to cast Black characters in basically White roles, or roles where the race differences  necessity cannot be explained—except to simply be blind wrt casting.  I’ve always assumed they were of British origin as I hear they have such a movement/agreement among producers.There is however a continued insistence on the majority of mixed race couples being Black man and White woman—8 out of 10 times.  I assume this is meant to emasculate the White male enemy.The prize however goes to a Netflix series where a Black male is getting it on with a much older, and infirmed White male.  How many boxes does that tic?

        The presumption of American interventionism is that the empire has something to offer. However, everything our current rulers gets involved with turns to shit. The premise of offering asylum to refugees is that their families will be better off in America. Instead, the wives turn into raging feminists and the children into gang-bangers. The deportees then spread this miasma in traditional Latin American societies which had no mechanisms for coping with them. The violent alien gangs now taking over American neighborhoods learned their methods from our own ghettos.

        Probably be more accurate to say that during the 20th century US policy was to protect its installed leaders in Latin America from the wrath of the people (e.g., Nicaragua’s Somoza). What’s good for United Fruit is good for the USA.
For maybe the last two decades China has been encroaching on the turf of USA’s backyard. In the words of Don Corleone, they’re making offers that can’t be refused. The bankrupt and increasingly backward US empire has nothing to offer remotely comparable.

        Most Viet Nam and GWOT veterans will tell you with at straight face that their wars would’ve been won if “only the gloves came off!”.
There are limits to military power.  Israel can bounce the rubble in every school house, apartment building, hospital, and day care center but at the end of the day there are 10 million Israelis surrounded by a billion Arabs who don’t much care for them.

            I think there’s some truth to that veteran attitude. Vietnam, in particular. But what exactly would have been “won”? That’s the bigger question than whether or not it could have been. “Taking off the gloves” against Germany and Japan ultimately led to watching this far flung empire being mismanaged by credentialed retards and sycophants, although I guess a lot of the right people got rich along the way. Much less than that likely would have been “won” in Vietnam or Iraq.

                This seems correct.  We might have forced an effective demilitarized zone, cessation of conflict, and time to organize a capitalistic State as we did in South Korean.  However, given that China succumbed to a mixed economic system (Who’d have thought at the time?), Vietnam has as well, and with great results.  Hard to think of a “better” outcome for Vietnam.  Asians are capitalists at heart.  We wasted 50k lives and a trillion dollars in the folly of Americanizing Vietnam.

                    If the travel bloggers can be believed, the younger Vietnamese have largely forgotten the war and do not hold it against the American people.
I suppose that’s one small blessing in the aftermath of that completely unnecessary, tragic conflict.

                        There was a video blogger making the rounds of Vietnam after getting kicked out of China.  In Hanoi there was an American flag display (created in rocks or flowers, I forget) at the end of one of the main street intersections.  Basically announcing to the world Vietnam was open for business—Americans *need* apply.  😉
Since then I’ve heard of companies fleeing China due to better offers from Vietnam.  Seems to match the “country of origin” markings I see more and more often on products I buy.

                It took the Northern Alliance at least 100 years to truly “liberate” the South in the USA (Civil War to 1960’s Civil Rights legislation and “integration” by armed troops aiming guns at unarmed school children).
Same language, race, history, culture, government, religions, etc.
Yet Americans still persist in thinking that bombing the every loving crap out of “Enemy X” 6,000 miles away and separated by vast oceans will work in a couple of months.
A few years, tops.
Where they have completely foreign languages, races, history, culture, religions, government, etc.

                    ProZ, you gotta admit, the GAE’s success at transforming Germany into a nation of pliant pacifist wussies has been extraordinary. And it hardly took a decade. This was what fueled their hubris in thinking they could do it everywhere. And maybe they could have, if they were willing to kill as many everywhere else as they did in Germany. Without that qualification being met, we’ll never really know for sure.

            “Can’t win a war if you don’t try!” 🤔 – the MICMy mom to this day refuses to buy Exxon gas.  She and my dad (Navy) had a lot of friends fighting in Vietnam.  They often told stories about how the shooting would stop so fuel trucks – Exxon – could drive north.  I think it was her first of many red pills hearing that from combat veterans she and my dad respected.I think a lot of people on our side assume that Trump will just knee jerk support Israel’s military actions.  But his record is the Abraham Accords and bilateral trade deals.Nobody in that part of the world cares about the Palis either.  There’s a reason why all their leaders live in penthouses in Qatar.  That war is like a spat between the hated ex wives of two of your brothers.

        I posted a link to that Weiss Thiel interview a couple of days ago. Pertinent to today, Thiel spent several minutes making the case for why Iran must not get a nuclear weapon. Ironically, because Israel has the weapon plus those of the US, it is the exact reason why in Tehran’s view they must get it – as a deterrant.In any case, Iran is going to be a major focus of the GAE. It almost feels like even though the neocons have been renounced formally by Trump and Thiel and others, it isn’t a change of policy, strategy and tactics but rather just a change of who is running the show.It is all quite depressing. You could solve almost the entirety of the immigration problem without any international diplomacy. It is funded and operated within the borders of former-America. NGOs, governors, Senators, bureaucrats, corporate boards and senior management … … are funding and running the operation. This invasion isn’t some failure. It is deliberate and fully coordinated and operated by the ruling class.Why? Walmart just announced it is opening a major distribution center in Nicaragua or Honduras or Guatamala. One of those places I don’t give the first fuck about them getting access to Sam’s Club.A while ago, when phony heat was being placed on Mayorkas by the Senate he said that this invasion is necessary and cited that the foreign remittances were essential to America. That opened me up to thinking that this was how the GAE was going to control/bribe colonies into its orbit.A couple of weeks ago, Germany announced an agreement with Kenya to import tens of thousands of Kenyans to drive buses in former-Germany. As is typical of this sloppy low-concern for good propaganda and story regime, they cited the following as a benefit: This would be good for Kenya because they could use the remittance money to tax Kenyans in their homeland getting the remittances, and then pay their debts.Now it all adds up. You import helots. You pay them. Germany, sodden in debt, gets bus drivers to pay. Kenyans in Germany pay large fees to the banks and wire houses to send extra money back to Kenyans in Kenya. Kenya’s government high officials take their cut. They tax the rest and pay interest on their unsurmountable debt. Banks rake in the cash on both sides and do not have to eat their losses. Even better, at some point this economic, “growth”, will result in Walmart distribution centers opening in Kenya.So, this is a system of global usury on a scale that is beyond anything fathomable in the annals of human history. I suppose it explains why the push for globohomo and white erasure in corporate ads.Of course, Germany being able to pay bus drivers with ever more debt is the lynchpin of the system which of course is dependent upon America being able to dole out money from its ever growing pile of debt.As Z-Man points out, Americans and America are not under consideration. These people are falling all over themselves to not be American in the first place. That is another major reason why they hate Trump. He loves America and they hate it.We are on our own. Trump will provide cover and some minor openings for us. I assume there will not be mass deportations and if they actually happen will be pleasantly surprised. I assume Hegspeth will legitimately reverse the ethnic cleansing of Whites from the military and may even punish Goldfein, CQ Brown, Milley, Austin and the large cadre of traitors who have for years undertaken the anti-White ethnic cleansing of the military under the guise of equity/DEI/CRT … …If only the latter happens that will be a big win for us as we can get a decent toehold in at least one institution and an important one.We are run by merchants. Business, growth, technological progress, while not bad things are what they believe are the only things that matter. They believe that those things lead to prosperity and that is enough to have a civilization and a stable society.They are wrong. But, they have the power, and they are going to fail in order to be proven wrong. The damage that will be done is scary to contemplate. Use Trump’s term as a bridge to pass over into the other side.Build networks amongst Our folk. Own property and gather together. Obtain local power and control. Build patrimony and strengthen the network. Accumulate wealth by building but make the definition of wealth not be solely measured in dollars but in the groundwork for a healthy and viable long term peoplehood who are closed to outsiders but have high trust within the in group. We are behind all of the other groups in this regard. This is how they already operate and why they own small franchises in every nook and cranny of America. We have to catch up and be determined to in a generation or two surpass them. The first thing is forming a strong in-group preference and exercising with prudence and subtlety.If you operate in any Regime institution fine. Be the best and go as far as you can go. Take the spoils of this and be a patron of the American Asturias that will survive post-America.Pray that Trump and any patriots on his team can make some tactical and strategic gains that will help us over the coming decades.

            Pressuring Iran so they will not get the bomb will only result in them getting the bomb. The religious leaders do not want a bomb for religious reasons, but they have said that if Iran or the regime is threatened, then they will allow it. The Obama people understood this, which is why they made the deal with Iran, but then Trump junked it. One of the enduring aspects of our foreign policy is the steadfast refusal to learn anything about the rest of the world.

                Agreed. Thiel’s case was that the bomb would allow Iran to use its networks across the Middle East to intervene in foreign countries.
It is all projection. Israel and its North American vassal having the bomb allow them to meddle across the Middle East in exactly the fashion disapproves of.
The bomb would give Iran a deterrent and hopefully lessen shenanigans by both sides.
The GAE is a belligerent force. Per your article today you make the great point. It is belligerent toward its own people, and hated by its own people as much as by people abroad.

                “ One of the enduring aspects of our foreign policy is the steadfast refusal to learn anything about the rest of the world.”Certainly that is true, but is such a complete answer?  Could it not be that we view the rest of the non-Western world (with perhaps the exception of sub Sahara Africa) through a filter?  A lens that views people and cultures in terms of American ideals and culture?   In other words, scratch the surface and you’ll find an American waiting to come out?Seems that we assume some sort of pathological equalitarianism—not only at home, but abroad.  If we can’t accomplish such when we import them here, why would we expect success exporting such thinking abroad?

                I don’t believe the sincerity of the fatwa against nuclear weapons. It did not ever stop Pakistan from getting nukes nor several other Muslim countries from trying. And it seems very inconsistent that a religion as war-like as islam would forego the most potent weapon of the age. They were perfectly happy to supplement scimitars with cannons and other firearms back in the day. Deceit is also allowed under Islamic law. They’re not exactly Amish when it comes to weapons technology

                “ Now it all adds up. You import helots. You pay them. Germany, sodden in debt, gets bus drivers…”I must comment on the irony of this observation.  I can remember being in the Netherlands in1968 and even at that early date, the Dutch were talking about the “Turks” who were imported to fill labor shortages and now that the country had stabilized and was in less need of foreign manual type labor, the Turks could not be repatriated—albeit they were never citizens nor promised citizenship.   They were simply guest workers, who at the termination of their work contracts, simply refused to leave.This seemed perplexing to the native population (my family).  The discussion was about how much money they were being paid to voluntarily “leave” and how to force such repatriation, but never to my recollection, forced deportation.We reap what we sow.

            I want to add something here. The GAE offers a very powerful and seductive fruit – unprecedented personal affluence.Nobody is immune to it. The American people fell for it first and are now awakening to its nightmare. Affluence is not bad but it isn’t a cure-all and it has its darkness.That fruit is going to be bitten by the world who all want a bite. We must stop with blaming and whining and complaining about Jews. We must look at them and see why they are best suited for an order like what exists and will perpetuate for a long time. We must learn and in the important ways that suit our bio-spirit adopt/adapt.We have to develop an ethno narcissism but not be paranoid. We must feel that for us our way is superior but not be supremacists. We must be all about Us. This business is Aryan owned. I frequent it and not the others. This school is Aryan operated – I send my kids there and I train, mentor and hire from it. I need an accountant, lawyer, electrician … … I use the Aryan network almost exclusively if not exclusively to hire, recommend, rate … …When 70-120 million of us are operating that way, we will be a colossus. When we need lower skilled people, we hire our own. This can happen across Europe as Our cousins there respond to being abandoned and betrayed as we have been. We will ultimately forge ties with them in the same way as well.I estimate 30-40% of European people will survive this order. That means a coordinated and organized diaspora of 300-400 million people. We can do something with that. The governments of The West are not Western and they are a wrecking ball to The West.Western Civilization is that 30-40% that chooses today that to operate in this way that preserves and develops itself according this new model and new way of behaving and the journey creates heroes and a future that is bright. If the percentage of our current 900 million is higher – all the better. Be that initial 5% and help it swell to 30 then 40. That is our focus and that is our task. The West lives or dies with us.All for today.

            The holy grail of business models is getting the bulk, or even all, of your revenue from fedguv. Because it prints the unlimited free loldollars, the customer never runs out of money. Demand never wanes. In bygone days of yore this was more limited to defense contractors and construction companies building infrastructure, but now everybody is getting in on that act while the getting is good, and every day coming up with new and ingenious ways to play this angle. The average person has little concept of what is happening, such as wal mart paying to import wogs, get them signed up for EBT, which they spend at wal mart. Just one of the more obvious examples.

Oh, for sure.
Near the end of my time in the MIC it was astounding to see how much of our information technology infrastructure was being moved to the Microsoft cloud.
It eventually got to the point where it was impossible to tell where our firm ended and Microsoft/the government began.

        The priorities of the US foreign policy establishment are obscene and absurd.  I guess there is no money to be laundered through wars in South America.
Steve Sailer has been pointing out the absurdity of the US neglect of Mexico and South America since W invaded Iraq.  What happens south or the Rio Grande matters more to the US than what happens in the Mideast.

        Just one more example, as if more are needed, as to how corrupt, incompetent and evil the US government is – and has been, for a long time.  Nothing that would actually benefit the American people as a whole is given the least bit of consideration, because DC doesn’t give a s***.  They’re going to do what they want to do and nothing else matters.  They don’t even try to sell these clusterf**** to the populace anymore – the hoi poloi be damned.  They need a huge roundhouse to the metaphorical kisser – in whatever form that takes…

        “The people who select and groom these people select and groom people who are compelling to them, rather than the target audience.”Sounds like the Democrat Party nominating process. Which speaks to regime attitudes in general. You see similar qualities in the handpicked “leaders” of Canada, UK, Germany, list goes on. Giving up any degree of control is unthinkable, thus we get the handpicked candidates and “leaders,” who will always protect regime interests, rather than candidates the people might want who could be less reliable for the actual regime. Somehow Trump broke through that, in part because the Republicans are more incompetent, but also because Republican voter base is less willing to always do as they are told, I think that’s true too. Fewer NPCs on that side, as a percentage.

        Talk about a crisis of competency, I would think our policy makers realize that it’s not helping to regime change Venezuela by providing a relief valve that lets thousands of disgruntled and miscreant Venezuelans flood into the U.S. But here we are, checkbook diplomacy instead, as usual. They want to have their cake and eat it too, upend a foreign country while disrupting their own simultaneously. Even though it may have cost them the election. What a strategy!

        Protected by two oceans, the U.S. has not had to worry overmuch about Eurasian powers stepping to it. That left the local governments of the Americas as potential enemies. Yet, since Mexico invaded Texas, there has not been one single nation in the Western Hemisphere willing and able to stand up to America. The United States, spoiled for choice and with a plethora of good options, cannot seem to make real friends in the region. Only Canada seems to like America, and Canada is a mirror-clone of American society. Of course you like yourself, ensconced in a dreamworld of Hollywood images and tropes.Washington relies on the shiny glint of American power to impress the natives, it’s image burnished by sight of the American legions going around the globe. Like a gang in South-Central L.A. the U.S. uses monetary prestige in conjunction with force to overawe countries from Argentina to Costa Rica.This dualism — sometimes expressed as Coca Colonization of the locals — leads to frustration and resentment on the part of Latin Americans. Like the Muslim world, the Latin Americans know they are weak and hate it. Every Latino working as a rent-a-cop in Texas or a hotel maid in Florida speaks to the humiliating second class nature of the Southern nations. They long to be as good as Americans but just can’t seem to get there.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

        Having spent a few years in the DC bubble as a youth (though admittedly as a low-level outsider), it’s hard to describe how little those people cared about Americans and even less about Mexico and South America.Sure, there was the Jewish contingent, but the goys were just as bad. If they thought about normal Americans at all, it was disdain, but, generally, they didn’t think about them at all, except for how to trick them into voting for so and so. They’re domestic world was the DC, Philly (lots of Jews from Philly), NYC, Boston (sort of) and LA. At the time, San Francisco wasn’t part of their world. Tech hadn’t invaded DC yet.They cared more about Toledo, Spain, than Toledo, Ohio because they’d been to Spain.

        @ZMan – Neglect?
At some point, I think you will find it simpler and easier to explain these many Many overseas policies that each contribute to damage the cohesion, prosperity, peace and survival of the USA (e.g. Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, South America… you name it) as Not a matter of “neglect”, nor of incompetence (because “errors” are, somehow, Always in an adverse-to-the-USA direction)  – but instead a matter of deliberate, strategic malice.

        The US Navy may be obsolete in certain respects, but it could do a fine job of blockading the ports and interdicting the airspace of nations sending us drugs and migrants. Same with the  Peruvian/Chinese port. No ground troops required, except maybe an occasionally punitive Marine unit, for educational purposes.

            That might work, but it is likely to be counter-productive.  It will only increase the incentive to leave and come here.
What we need is akin to a “fly paper” strategy – help them over there so we don’t have to support them over here.  But that means doing actually helpful things like infrastructure and fair deals (like the Chinese).

            The USA spends collectively something like $1.2-$1.5 trillion a year on law enforcement and the military at all levels. It could do a lot more than it does, it just chooses not to. Just the other day I saw an article about how the FBI is circulating memos about the Venezuelan gangs setting up shop across the USA. The idea that this entire apparatus can do little more than watch and send emails to itself is ridiculous. The only conclusion one can possibly come to is that they want these drug gangs, traffickers, and other criminal enterprises here, making life miserable for the proles.

        The group that runs the empire doesn’t see America as “home”.
It is only an increasingly antique and irrelevant segment of this thing who continue to entertain fantasies of co-existence with them.

            It’s not just the Jews. The Goys don’t see all of America as their home either – and haven’t for decades. To them, the bulk of America is just some unsophisticated hinterland filled with rednecks and Dollar Generals.

                I forget who it was, I think one of those Frankfurt School Jews, who wrote about traveling cross country by train.  Seeing all of those small towns in flyover country horrified him.  He saw them as a threat.

                    I’ll make a plug for a relatively recent book, Robert Plomin’s “blueprint”, which basically is a well written survey of the state of evidence for the notion that aggregate human behavior is downstream of genome. The ‘science’ is settled. Blank slatists have lost their war against reality.The “Frankfurt School Jews” and all their fellow travelers are never going to change. THEY CANNOT CHANGE. They are who they are, and because of this there can never be peaceful coexistence within the same polity. Either we separate or one of us is going to go extinct.MAGA MAMA -&gt; Make Aliya Great Again Make Aliyah Mandatory Again

        I think Marco Rubio’s nomination as sec. of state is a result of Trump’s desire to refocus and repair relations among our southern neighbors. It would also get him out of the senate (DiSantis will appoint his successor), and it would place him in a position to use whatever “strengths” he possesses. The heavy lifting in Europe, Asia, and the Mideast will belong to Trump personally, as these are some of the most vexing issues of our time.

            Up until his alleged conversion to the Trump side, Rubio’s plan was to engage in neocon foreign policy escapades in Central and South America.  He was desperate to invade Venezuela when he ran for President in 2016.  I don’t know how sincere is his adjustment has been to the Trump worldview, but hopefully with the focus shift comes a shift in tactics as well.

                    Our future AG Gaetz mentioned Bukele in an approving statement. He knows, which is STAGGERING progress. However, the culling of the genetic and memetic defectives that is necessary MUST be done one’s own people for it to be sustainable and supported. There is no way in hell any foolish civnat MAGA types are going to be able to pull it off against our internal fake-American riff-raff here in AINO.
