        I’ve seen the Internet drive people insane in real time. I had a friend in academia back at the dawn of Social Media. He was always a Liberal, but it was possible to be friends with Liberals then — they were, or at least could be, fundamentally decent people with a few nutty ideas, like that girl who believes in healing crystals and whatnot. But he got a job at a small college out in the sticks, in a deep Red state. So instead of trying to adjust to his new social reality, wherein he’d have to interact with Bush voters (at that time) on a daily basis, he went 100% online, back when that took real commitment to the bit. And, of course, now he’s “so proud” of his transgender kids etc. And this after a suicide attempt…

            That 2000 election was an inflection point for the people we call the left. They were all piling online with the rest of the country and suddenly they could get instant affirmation from newly formed online communities. All of a sudden, that liberal guy you can have a friend became an intolerable asshole.

                It went further than merely becoming an intolerable asshole. In my case, my California friend starting behaving in ways that were positively inimical to white civilization. He married a Chinese woman, had children by her, bought off on open borders, and basically ignored all the degeneracy around him…or blamed it on Republicans. I went from being a pretty close friend to being an outright enemy. In a civil war, I would have no issue with eliminating him now.

                    Yeah I also lost track of guys who would get married and have babies with other races. I mean, if someone is willing to do that to their own child then how much can I trust them?

                        You need to understand this an a possibly unconscious reaction to the white women’s feminism.  It makes the women crazy (and undateable) and in turn makes the men crazy too.
Oddly, non-white women who marry white man are more “pro white” than your average white liberal slut or hag.

                    “In a civil war, I would have no issue with eliminating him now.”
Doubtful, TBO. Statistically most people aren’t psychologically equipped to intentionally kill others, much less so in a purposeful matter, and even much more less so those who are capable of employing lethal force as purely practical course of action (hunting animals doesn’t count). Bright side is your psychotic friend, assuming he is capable, has no other redeeming values and would just as likely be liquidated by his own side when local events slowed down.

                        But he said in a civil war. Psychological preemption that obtains in an irenic environment tends to go by the boards during actual warfare. Otherwise, there could be no war.

                            Yep, there is a psychology behind it all.  You shoot someone, you are not going to think “I should not have done this, I’m a bad person”.  No, you’re going to embrace your “cause” all the more firmly.  You are in the right, they are in the wrong sort of thing.  Those who don’t are ineffective, or dead.

                        Most people aren’t sadistic killers, mass killers or serial killers. But most people are capable of killing given the right circumstances.  The idea that most people are psychologically incapable of killing is a comforting lie.

                        The first one is the toughest, then you get used to it.ln every conflict there is hesitancy to take life.  It is bred into us as most of us come from a civilized society.  Hence the training of soldiers to react and obey rather than think.  In any stressful situation you revert to your level of training, or reaction/muscle memory, *without* conscious thought.  Been there, done that.What *will* happen is a hesitancy to be the first to employ a lethal response, but not necessarily to react to a lethal provocation, e.g., to shoot back once shot at.  That is called “survival instinct”.  If you survive that first encounter, you will progress to a shoot first ask questions later mode.  Count on it.

                        I think you would absolutely marvel at what humans are capable of when they have been pushed, prodded, and abused for long enough and in an extreme enough fashion. I’m sure millions of Germans just woke up one day and as the meme say “for no reason at all” started throwing Roman salutes. 🙄
You don’t get out much, you go into the deeper and darker places on the web and you will find plenty of people willing and able to do the mass culling. I do not doubt their sincerity.

                Well, it didn’t help that the Bush administration was staffed by the most incompetent, stupidest, sleaziest group of gangsters, war criminals, and con men you could possibly imagine. Which is why it was so bizarre to see Kamala Harris cozying up to them. It woudn’t surprise me if that gave a fair number of these lefties whiplash and kept them from the polls last week.

                            Now there is a name I remember from the early years of my redpilling, before I had crossed the line into (((awareness))). I just went to check my suspicions and … yes, every damn time. Make Aliyah Great Again!

                        That was 90% TDS driven. They only did it because McCain had stuck his finger in Trump’s eye. Absent that, they still would have had some public observance, but probably only about 10% of the circus that it was.

                        I find it so strange that the people with TDS, many of whom also had BDS, managed to rehabilitate Bush and Cheney in their minds. At least having BDS and TDS is consistent, but absolving Bush and Cheney in the process of demonizing Trump. Just totally weird and doesn’t make any sort of sense logically.

                Interesting, because it was after the year 2000 that I started to find liberal friends and even open borders Republicans intolerable. They were suddenly more determined to tell me off for any politically incorrect opinion I had. I can’t say that it was them who left me though, because honestly I dropped them. So, maybe realizing there were lots of people online who agreed with my opinions made me less willing to indulge libs.

                    It certainly can work both ways. I think the recent snap back is due to normal people seeing other normal people online revolt against things like DEI and the tranny business. The cascade effect is what we have just experienced. For well adjusted people, this  results in a defense of common morality, but for crazy people it results in a more intense madness. I doubt we get the tranny business, for example, without the internet. It gave these freaks a cheering section they could not have in real life.

                        Lot of what I’ve done online over past decades is simply giving other men the courage, the permission, to acknowledge their own experiences and outlooks, and be active in expressing them.
I had a grade-school buddy who played linebacker and special teams in the NFL for many years.  His job on special teams was to sprint downfield on kickoffs and bust-up the offensive wedge confronting his team.  They called him ‘Captain Crazy’.
Ended up with concussion aftereffects in his later years.  But that was the gig and somebody’s gotta do it.

                        Men who aren’t sexually insane reject them, if allowed. Some are crediting Trump’s win with hispanic men wholly to this. “Machismo,” etc. But the internet has been decisive in selling women on (and into) troonshit.In real life, “trans men” are effeminate midgets, visibly traumatized, a piteous horror, and “trans women” are frighteningly costumed, stinking, looming men, broadcasting obsessive perversion. The “spiteful mutant”/sex hazard alarm blares at all of them.On the internet trannies become self-help/-assertion rhetoric and the 1/1000 pictures where they “pass”—butstill they don’t. (The most perverse revel in not doing it and making you say the line.) They’re not transformed into the opposite sex but into something else that women love dearly: false advertising aimed at them. Check any turn of the century women’s magazine. The same language is all there: exhaustion, existence, etc. The pervstook it, and it worked. They re-“coded” the whole genre.(Women do love being brutally overpowered, sexually mutilating children, etc., but that’s secondary here.)

                            Underrated comment and spot on about the Lovecraftian Horrors that are trans individuals. They are horrific and poor facsimiles of the things they are attempting to be.We literally made an entire movie about this awful malady in the form of Silence of the Lambs where it was obvious to all living beings that these creatures are pitiable and need therapy. Instead they have become emboldened and militant.They need to now be driven back underground where they have always existed as it is obvious that the “give an inch take a mile” idiom applies massively to all gender confused weirdos.

                I must disagree with your thesis today, Z. Superficially, it is true that the Internet helps the crazies coalesce.But here we are discussing alt-right ideas on the Internet… and the Left would accuseusof being the “racist, sexist, fascist, misogynist” nutjobs.To us, this is merely a community of like-minded normal folk. I read a number of Internet forums, some of them technical, and they are oases of sanity and thoughtfulness and expertise, not craziness.How do we explain the sheer craziness of the Jacobins and the Bolsheviks and the Spanish Republicans? How do we explain the willingness of millions of Yankees to kill millions of Confederates, and vice-versa? How do we explain the willingness of millions of Aztecs to go along with the sacrifices?We cannot blame the Internet for any of that, and that kind of stuff makes Trump Derangement Syndrome look like a child’s tantrum by comparison.Frankly I think the craziness is caused not by the Internet but by the prevalence and dominance of women (and of feminized men) in our institutions.Not for nothing does the term “hysterical” originate in the Greek word for “uterus.”

                The small town hicklib is always the most vocal and obnoxious creep to deal with.

He openly advocates The State before his own people, and thinks himself virtuous.

                    Jay Nordlinger–I know, I know–noted that there is no Leftist further left than the southern Leftist. What he meant is that the southern Leftist, guilty because of her provenance and insecure because she fears her fellow non-southern Leftists view her with suspicion, performs her Leftism in an especially histrionic and melodramatic fashion. She will always, loudly and vociferously, proclaim positions to the left even of her fellow Leftist radicals. Nordlinger was correct. I’ve seen this phenomenon in the flesh, as it were, and it ain’t pretty.

                Alternatively, social pressure still keeps these types somewhat in line. Trannies really aren’t a thing in the sticks because of the opprobrium they and, importantly, their mothers would receive. It does require some meat space social networking for the more extreme public displays. The HickLib rather enjoys the perceived martyrdom but there are hard limits. That aside, if I get to run our gulags, HickLibs and Southern progressives go to the showers first. They are the absolute worst.

                The internet greatly facilitates the hive-mindedness of the Left.  The Left transformed from individual or small-group political opinions into a herd, a full-blown dogmatic religion.  No variance from The Dictum is tolerated, and violators and thrown quickly into the void.
Females — collective by nature — are especially susceptible to this condition, as phenomena like the PussyHat rallies reveal.  Males are much more individualistic, which from a political standpoint is a drawback.

                During the LA-Based Comedian Podcast Era (2010-2017) the hicklib thing was a big deal. There were all sorts of comedians who claimed they came from small towns in nowheresville and then would come onto Marc Maron’s podcast and basically thank their lucky stars that they got to to bantz with Jews in green rooms instead of being stuck in their non-LA career with non-LA values.

        “At the top of the hierarchy are those who master both minds, deftly balancing them to be high status in both the material world and the virtual world.”You know, like a real estate mogul who moved into the largely fake TV media market and became a successful celebrity, then parlayed that into a profoundly impactful online media empire which got him elected President.  Twice.We live in crazy times because 25% of the country believes in provably crazy things.  Men cannot become women, for example.  That is insane.  Masks no more protect you from a virus than a chain link fence keeps out mosquitos, and a vaccine that makes you more likely to get sick is not a vaccine.  You cannot beat Russian bullets with Reddit.The web gives crazy people a voice, and they use it effectively.  As our side has grown more adept at achieving the balance, we have grown more successful at beating them back.  And we have Gen X sitting out there sardonic and cynical making fun of it all…and that is driving the crazies into hiding.  For now.

            The anonymity of the internet gives powerless people a sense of freedumb so they feel unconstrained to reveal their inner weird. But other weirdos suddenly realize that they have had the same thoughts and this thing self-organizes into a “community.” Then it gains traction in the media which is always looking for the latest novelty. It used to be that if you wrote a  letter to the local paper and it got published, it boosted your feeling of self-worth a bit but you also worried what others thought. If you wrote two letters to the local paper and they got published, you were considered a crank. With the internet, all manner of crankish ideas gain ascendancy.

                Anonymity is a two edged sword.  It protects people.  But sometimes people and their ideas don’t deserve that protection.
It is taking time but I think generally the trend is that crazy things subside.  It’s hard to maintain the frenzy necessary to sustain a professed or actual belief in impossible things.

            I don’t think many peoplereallybelieve that men could become women. Maybe 5% of the population. Ten years ago, nobody, and I do mean nobody, thought that men could become women. The entire transgender project is built on a word trick, claiming that our gender and our sex are two different things that only correlate “sometimes.” This is ridiculous, obviously, but that is really all it is built on. The rest is social pressure and a demand for “tolerance.” So, just because people say it, doesn’t mean they believe it. This was the point of 1984. The Party demanded Big Brother be loved, not just the public proclamation of such… but the fact that the Ministry of Love existed at all was evidence that the work was ongoing.This is probably why the entire “woke” thing has faded so fast. People really don’t believe the stuff they were saying five years ago. Of course this isn’t true of everything – there is a reason why gay marriage still has a high level of public support, and it’s because people have bought into the “love is love” crap that has been used to push it through (of course anyone who has ever heard a gay man talk about his lifestyle knows that, well, it’s not quite like that).

                “Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.”― Theodore Dalrymple

                        “Life At The Bottom” is a great repudiation on welfare. After reading it I was left with the impression welfare is a crime against the poor. It doesn’t help them; it was very similar to our slums, they were majority white and no difference.

                    This is 99% of the reason the corporate world forces people to list “their pronouns”. It’s humiliation designed to intimidate and cow everyone into accepting the most odious and disingenuous parts of the Left’s dogmas. For that matter it was the same thing driving the vaccine, mask and social distancing nonsense.I suspect the reason the masks were finally abandoned was that a lot of people almost completely stopped going to local stores or indoor spaces and this did too much damage to the local economies to keep it up. I certainly did so. Of course, predictably, this shifted commerce to the internet and I guess they figured out that not everyone can work for Amazon. I suspect a lot of the preference for Zoom meetings among the more sane and normal people was just not wanting to deal with the mask Nazis in person.I predict that they won’t bring back the masks and social distancing but will come up with some new humiliating ritual when the next panic rolls around. This is what the new fascism looks like.

                I was plowing 2 feet of heavy snow in Colorado last weekend, when my tractor started leaking transmission fluid.Do you have any idea how hard it is to call the small engine repair guy to report that you blew a tranny?I hate what they’ve done to the language. 😂Agree with you that few people actually believe this stuff.  99% of mask wearers took them off after the court ruling.  If the country is ideologically split in half, then half the country – the ones calling us “grandma killers” should have kept wearing them.But it turns out that professed belief in impossible things does indeed have a limit.

        Watching liberal meltdowns online is funny as hell — until it’s a friend and family member who’s in genuine anguish because they truly believe that bible-toting fascists are preparing to lynch the joggers and turn women into birthing husks.In my own life, I’ve seen intelligent people who are otherwise kind, giving, generous, and concerned for the welfare of others turn into sobbing messes because they believe evil is on the march. It’s true that many of these unhinged leftists were crazy to begin with. However, many more had their better natures hijacked by the nonstop propaganda coming from our news media, from movies, from education, and from our own government. Add in social media, and these people hardly stood a chance.It’s like with the Civil Rights movement. We’ve all seen plenty of sob stories about Little Jamal being spit on when he tried to enter a White school. But we’ve never seen widespread movies about what little Billy suffered as his neighborhoods and school was invaded by violent, low IQ blacks. And today, for example, we’ve never seen widespread information about how damaging “gender affirming care” truly is. There’s no afterschool movie entitled, “Bobby is sorry he cut off his dick.”For true sanity to return, we need to change the balance of propaganda. We need stories that highlight the real, personal damage caused by everything from the Civil Rights movement to this latest trans craze. And while we’re at it, we need more stories glorifying our own people and culture.But for that to happen, we need to remove from power the foreign elite who’s been pulling the strings. It won’t be easy, but it might be possible, especially with some hard sunlight shining on their misdeeds, including bribery and blackmail of our own elected officials.

        You’re right about Olbermann and the two-mindedness the internet brings, or reveals.  I recall when Olbermann was a standard sports-reporter on ESPN, indistinguishable from the others.  But we see now he is an unbalanced Prog extremist that I wouldn’t even trust around my dog.  If I had a dog.As for innate ability to forget pain, I congratulate you if you have this capacity, but I doubt it is general in nature.  I remember my pain quite well as it is never far away.I was around in the Fifties and Sixties and can affirm it is no delusion that those were FAR better times in America than the current madness and divisiveness.  The Woke-Fem Politburo was absent then, or at least in infancy, and relations between the sexes was vastly superior to the current day.  Family abounded.  Racial relations also were much better in the Fifties than in the present time.In the Fifties and Sixties people had extended families, cheap and well-constructed housing, stable lifelong jobs, kids, and were generally content.  America was far healthier and more whole.  Now we dwell in endless atomization, discontent and subterfuge.  I do not agree that this is a ‘trick of the mind’.  It is real.

            I have to admit that I actually liked Olbermann during the George W Bush years.  He called out the Iraq war for the idiocy that it was and routinely attacked it’s cheerleaders on Fox.   I kept watching him until early 2008 when I realized that he didn’t give a crap about the war, it was simply a red team vs blue team thing for him and that he was clearly bat crap crazy for Obama.

                Olbermann is a prime example of something I’ve noted for many years, since back when I was a civnat, which is, the left, while presenting themselves as and often being confused for peaceniks, only oppose wars that are waged by a Republican in the WH; they support all wars waged by Democrats in the WH.

                    Either the “peace movement” was largely some kind of communist front organization just like the paleo-conservatives always said it was or the actual number of authentic peaceniks has fallen off a cliff. The only arguments seem to be overwhichcountry to start a war with and this at a time when the US military has never been less capable in modern times.

            Olbermann was the original “word salad” commentator. Yes, his thought process was definitely better than Harris, but it was extraordinarily pretentious. One could not help but think his entire oration had nothing to do with informing an audience, but rather assuaging his ego. I could swear he returned to his dressing room and kissed the mirror after every performance.

                Olbermann has a great gift in front of the camera but if you browse his Wikipedia, it’s easy to see he has burned every single bridge he’s ever walked on. ESPN even gave him multiple chances and he blew them all up. That is why he is a relative nobody doing a podcast instead of doing World News Tonight making millions of dollars. He has to be one of the most unlikeable, arrogant, blowhar assholes in television history… and that is saying something.

        ” In the fullness of time, people may look at this time and think it was the calm waters before the terrible rapids.”Exactly. I see people saying all the time that we’re going back to greatness. Uh, I don’t think so.Mr. Trump is already appointing “Israel First!” folk and war whores to lots of critical offices. I think that train will come off the rails on that one when Russia tells them all to go screw off after they’re told again to obey the “Rules of Order”.Anyone who thinks we’re going to change and things will go back to the good old days is an absolute moron.. America has been swirling around the toilet bowl for over 50 years, and the people who took it there are still walking around running everything.My only reason for voting at all, and for Trump, is that perhaps the impending collapse of the United States has been kicked down the road a few years. If you think it’s going to get better, you are going to get it real good and real hard.

                Last week at work I had a couple visitors from a sister facility.  Given the election, it was easy enough to get into politics while in the safety of my office.  One of them was, like me, Gen X.  He had some good opinions on some subjects, particularly the clot shot and much of the covid hysteria, but at some point he trotted out the line about wanting immigration, he just wanted it to be legal.  I used Z-Man’s line on him, “then why not just make it all legal?” and explained why immigration itself, and not the legality of it, is the problem.  God bless him, I could actually see the effect this had on him as he agreed and quietly admitted that he needed to think about that more.While we need to be honest about how many people can actually be saved, we shouldn’t give up trying either.  Sometimes you meet with success.

                    Good for you.  Next ask him why there is  need for any immigration at all.   If he can actually break from the “nation of immigrants” lie, then you’ve truly got a convert.  I just find people go into the weeds of ‘good people’ and ‘they want to work.’  Then you have to get into what is a nation, who says who gets to come and why, the whole idea of self-interest.  That brings in the “Who is my neighbor” issue – which is why I usually don’t even start the conversation in the first place.

        I’ve known hysterical Keith Olbermann types my whole life, seems to me that the internet gave these people an expanded audience &amp; access to like minded loons which fueled their madness. The biggest change I’ve noticed over time is an extreme fixation on Trump specifically &amp; the strangest thing I’ve noticed is these sorts of people seemed more angry towards him when he was out of office than when he was president. Every other republican president was basically forgotten when they left office but not Trump, then again the media never shut up about him. I don’t think that sufficiently explains the fact they talk about him like he was an abusive parent.Anytime I encounter one of these idiots ranting about Trump I tell them to show me on the doll where Trump touched them &amp; they always without fail have a conniption fit. I just can’t help myself anymore, its like a giant red button I can’t resist pressing for a laugh.

            If you really want to watch their eyes bug out, suggest that it was their unceasing fixation on the Orange Man which brought him back for another term. If they could have just let him go he probably would have gone away. It’s all the more effective for being true.

                That’d be good to roll out for the more ‘heady’ shitlibs who aren’t ranting so much as doing the whole “think of muh abortion” talking points. With the unhinged screamers I’m not convinced they’re capable of even the slightest introspection especially when they’re in the middle of a tantrum. With the psychotic rabid animal leftists you can’t even have a surface level discussion with them, you either try to deescalate them when they start amping up or poke the pig which is like lighting a fuse to a bomb.

The Progs ignored these issues because they are not binding constraints for inside-the-Beltway types.

        A Day in the Life of Donald Trump’s Greater Israel7:00 AM: You wake up groaning under 40% annual inflation. Fox News is extolling what a great honor it is to send Israel $50 billion dollars (the latest monthly extension) and what a great honor it is that the draft is being reinstated to fight in war against Iran which, unfortunately, requires boots on the ground. News claims that giant corporations have scaled back DEI, though, and they recommend doing your patriotic duty and signing up as soon as possible to help our greatest ally!8:00 AM: You head to work (early, you need to work 2-3 jobs to not even make ends meet). The number of non-whites despite Trump’s “mass deportations of illegals” is greater than ever – it almost seems like he’s “illegally deporting” in reverse and bringing more in. Well, he did expand the H1b visa program for Indians by 2 million per year, but at least that’s legal immigration, right?9:00 AM: You receive an email announcing your draft number. Luckily selective service is digital and they have all of your information, so you don’t have to go into a physical location! It’s very convenient. Your draft number puts you at least a couple months out from service – the war will have to be over by then, right? …right?12:00 PM: You use your Trump-sponsored CBDC to buy lunch. Luckily it’s not programmed yet to prohibit you from purchasing meat, but the news says those regulations are coming to help combat global warming.2:00 PM: You try to go on the internet to independent sites but, after the “Iranian hack”, internet use is strictly monitored – for your own good, of course. Reddit and Fox News are still easily accessible, though, so you can take comfort in that.3:00 PM: It’s always a strange thing watching liberals on the street wear pro-Trump t-shirts, but that’s what it’s come to. You observe liberals, obese boomers, and even a smattering of Mexicans and blacks wearing Trump t-shirts — he’s brought them all together. It almost brings a tear to the eye.6:00 PM: Your obese liberal girlfriend is wearing her Trump t-shirt again as she waddles around your small, dimly lit apartment. “Look how reasonable and moderate I am, I can update my opinion to take in new information. Look, even Reddit has come around on him!” she exclaims proudly. You want to die.8:00 PM: You look at your account balances – they’re negative, you will need to take out another payday loan. You can’t let yourself get fired either as Trump cut back on unemployment benefits (but not for non-whites).10:00 PM: You can’t take it any longer; you cry, and cry some more. There is no hope. You turn on Fox News and, like Winston Smith, try to appreciate that it’s all worth it because Israel just annexed parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. You’re doing your part.

            IMHO we’re being prepped for war with Iran.
They don’t need a draft. Crashing the economy will serve as a de facto draft. Under 30s will go to the military, 30 to 50s will go into the defense industry.
The catch will be that one will need a digital biometric ID to participate in either institution and receive their CBDC stipend (ration card).
Everyone who doesn’t opt in will just have to self-deport or starve.

            Nothing, and I mean literally nothing ever in history, has acted as greater accelerant for female narcissism than social media has. I suppose one upside to recent events is a growing willingness to tell women they suck balls and should shut up.

                Completely correct. The one caveat, however, is that the willingness only reaffirms the female’s view of herself as a victim.

            I saw Mark Dice today post a compilation of videos from Trump supporting women who were essentially rubbing it in.  Why?  The last thing we should do is supportany womanwho films her “deep thoughts” on camera and submits it to social media.  I don’t care what side of the aisle they’re on.Along those lines, my wife had FOX News on the other night and they did a man-on-the-street segment, asking NYC leftists their thoughts on the election.  Shoe-horned into it was a brief interview with a cross dressing man.  The only mockery of this thing was for being a Harris voter, not for being a mentally-ill freak.  Just a another brick in the wall of degeneracy, courtesy of our “conservative” friends.

        I believe the increasing lunacy of the left is a major reason Trump received a significantly higher share of the Hispanic vote than past GOP candidates. Hispanics tend to be, overall, simple people, (not a criticism) and therefore aren’t fooled by the left’s obsession with promoting tranny, drag queen and LBGTwhatever culture.

            Hardly anybody (especially not the “left”) wants to talk about it or think about it, but some percentage of it had to be not wanting to vote for a woman. And especially not for a woman of “color.” Even people “of color,” or some of them, have enough sense not to do that. However, I predict the Ds will be undeterred in nominating another woman shortly. Perhaps this will be their point of failure that those (on both the left and the right) who thought their ascendancy guaranteed never saw coming. Because I don’t believe the Ds are capable of learning the lesson and nominating a man instead. In part because they are no longer capable of holding an honest primary without their fingers on the scale for their handpicked candidate. As we have seen these last 3 cycles.Anyhow, the Rs gains among negro and mestizo men in this election will only cause them to double down in going after that demographic, which should work if they get another female D nominee, and won’t if they don’t.

                Negro Fatigue started to set in a few years ago, mostly on the fringes. The unvoiced disgust with Girl Bosses and feminized society is being vocalized now. Elections really don’t matter as far as the trajectory of things, but they do provide insight into social reality. I think the GOP no longer will be nationally competitive longer than another cycle. Look at the downticket races. Trump is not perceived as Republican. The Left also is atomizing at a rapid pace. Race and gender underpin both of these phenomena albeit in different ways. Dare I mention whites are starting to show racial consciousness and solidarity, too?

                Trump’s pick for Sec. of Defense Pete Hegseth is drawing fire because he said that women shouldn’t be in combat. How crazy is it that this is controversial? Would this statement by Hegseth be castigated if we didn’t have the internet? I don’t know but it seems the internet accelerates everything so what might have taken progressivism 20 years to advance without the internet now takes 5 with it. Thus bad ideas can gain traction and even be institutionalized before they are proven wrong. Enough accumulation of these bad ideas it seems to me can sink a society because societies are in competition with other societies in a kind of Darwinian struggle. Only the fittest survive. If we go toe to toe with a peer adversary that doesn’t share the woke mind virus, we might face a SHTF moment.Also, these crazy ideas are not always entirely wrong but the left always argue for them stripped of context. For example, women actually can serve in combat. I remember seeing a video of a woman medic in the trenches on the Ukraine side. But the fact that she was there speaks of desperation in the Ukraine recruitment effort. Not mentioned. Further never mentioned the much larger issue that a woman in combat is not at home having babies and raising children.

            Hispanics represent a traditional working class. They have similarities to the union laborers of the 1950’s. The want decent jobs with decent working conditions, affordable housing, affordable health care, and access to education. With Trump and, in particular Vance, the GOP is slowly starting to accommodate working class issues. This is the reason why Hispanics, and to a lessor extent, blacks are starting to vote for them.

        Ah well the human brain tends to forget the bad. If you broke a bone as a kid and was able to remember the pain, it would be excruciating. Same with women and childbirth. If a woman remembered how painful childbirth was, they’d be one and done. We also live in the transitory period where there’s a cohort of people that remember the before times (internet). Those that are chronically online never knew what it was like.

        Not sure where Z gets the idea that yearning for the past is part of human nature. Leftists, contrariwise, absolutely abominate the past and see history as the glorious sojourn from benighted racism, sexism, homophobia and religious superstition to enlightened worship of the Other. No matter how terrible they consider the present–such as the Trumpening–the past was even worse. Tautologous perhaps, but this justifies theirraison d’etre. It is they, the Leftists (progressives) who have been the motive force behind the transition from primitivity to sophistication. And if you doubt this, consider rhetorical artifices such as “the arc of history is long but bends toward justice” and “we are on the right side of history.” The cognitive dissonance that maintains this logical positivism in conjuction with postmodern irrationalism is the unstable device at the very heart of Leftism.

        Speaking of conspiracy theories, this one sounds insanely plausible. Biden and Trump cut a deal in which Biden sabotages Kamala by backing down the fraud machine and Trump in turn agrees to not prosecute the Biden Crime Family. Good old fashion American pragmatism. And normie gets to stay on the couch and put on a few more pounds. Yes, our future is bright indeed. When do the bacchanals start?

            It’s an interesting theory, and it makes some sense. But the sticking point is Biden’s mental state. While he certainly had the capacity to sabotage Kamala, it’s hard to believe he had the ability to back down the steal. That being said, the guy looks happy as hell that Trump won. Jill, too.

                Bingo. Biden will pardon everyone in his crime family that he can and he himself will never see a day in jail or even a prosecution because of his lack of ability to defend himself. That only leaves a few State charges for Hunter, and I expect those—if any—will not be pursued.
Lawfare for the Biden crime family seems not in the cards and to be fair, probably a distraction for Trump.

            The problem with that is there’s no such thing as a “gentleman’s agreement” anymore. Not that I believe Trump is going after Biden. So if my belief is correct, that’s a conspiracy theory that actually has legs, i.e., it will never be disproven.

        You address several unrelated issues. A romanticized view of the past has been with us since the dawn of man. Roman philosophers reminisced about a Golden Age that probably was far more brutish than what the empire offered at the time they lived. Fast forward to Rosseau and people long for primitivism. As you point out, people who lived through the Depression displayed a cognitive dissonance of the reality of the time. A few times the happy memories have basis in reality; people who came of age in the Gilded Age through WWI did live in a better time than the Thirties and early Forties if they lived to that point (Boomers and early X’ers may experience the same). This is an exception that does not prove a rule.The craziness of this age is rather unique. Social media and digital information has at a minimum accelerated madness. Social media, in particular, seems to increase narcissism and rage. It would take a talented shrink who isn’t an online maniac to dissect the “what” of it all. Can people handle and process that much information and artificial sharing? It appears not.

            Regarding The Great Depression, 30 years or so ago there was an ice storm in my hometown at Christmas, and the power was out for a day or 3. Afterwards it was common to hear that it was the best Christmas ever. I think the fond memories of the GD are kind of like that.
The military has known for a long time that it is shared hardship that builds camaraderie and unit cohesion. That’s why they have the recruits scrubbing the latrine with their toothbrushes.

                The “day or 3” is key. In the Nineties, I experienced an ice storm that resulted in loss of electricity for two full months in the distant city, less so ironically as you got further from the urban area. People started to display madness after a few weeks. Imagine that happening in this time, which at some point it will. People will have withdrawal symptoms on par with heroin addicts going cold turkey and the causalities will mount.

            The great pioneer in the internet making people insane was Something Awful. Every change that separates us from the “old internet” can be traced to “goons” (the site denizen nickname).The story is convoluted and boring and you wouldn’t recognize the names, but just for example, “troon” is a contraction of “transsexual goon,” because SA is where that contagion was unleashed. The “tranny janny”—pervert as censor/judge of the anonymous public, now a universal principle of Our Democracy—started there.Everythingwe think was ruined by the iPhone, by “normies” (the goon term fornormalfags, because they weren’t allowed to say “fag”), by Reddit (itself ruined by ShitRedditSays, a goon op), byinformation overload, etc., began at Something Awful.More broadly, every madness blamed on social media is caused bysocial media censorship. Something Awful invented it. We’re in the “life of its own” stage of the phenomenon, but a list of people did it. From Cloudflare to MasterCard to the DHS, they were all goons.When we were left alone, we were not crazy. Only they were.

            A Brit who once posted here under the nic“trumpton” argued the Regime had perfected what he called “mind worms” via algorithmic memetic repetition (my term) and so forth. That’s above my pay grade to evaluate, but something dramatically changed people’s reason and ability to be rational and that would seem to be at least a candidate for what happened or in the ballpark. There’s Before Digital (BD) and After Digital (AD) in this secular world now and the repercussions are obvious. Trumpton was a brilliant guy and had more familiarity than a lay person with the intersection of psychology and technology. If you can dig around the site and find his stuff it is worthwhile.

        So some lefties are going to start “cancelling” themselves, lol. They’re taking the advice they always lectured the right with, about how businesses were unfettered in who they did business with (unless you refused to bake a gay wedding cake!). But one platform (twitter) becomes less censorious, Zuckerberg talks about becoming neutral, alternate platforms are advanced (like Rumble). Even MSM’ers like the WaPo and LAT decline to endorse the “obvious” choice. The left has been losing their s**t for awhile now. Now they’re calling for governments to block/ban entire platforms for “just making business decisions.” They still have some European countries onboard as well as Brazil. I suppose 4 years ago they thought by now they’d have the whole virtual space sewn up, every wrong-thinker debanked and belly up in the water.

        I think the main reason for nostalgia in the middle-aged is the increasing diversity of the country (I live in California, where we have an extreme case of divercitosis). There is nothing like mobs of mestizos and Asians everywhere to make you feel that you are no longer at home. I think it has been established by sociological research that diversity makes me people unhappy and asocial.

        I think the nature of the two-mind problem Z broaches is that the virtual mind is, in the main, the honest one, while the physical mind is the politic one. All of us on this site, for instance, are free to say things, to speak truths, we could never get away with speaking in meatspace. Anonymity and distance allow one to speak his mind in the virtual environment. But anybody–particularly anybody on the Right–attempting such candor in physical interaction would immediately be unpersoned and cast into the void.

The virtual space takes us out of the meat space and removes the social cues like the looks on peoples’ faces.  That kind of complex interaction is replaced with abstractions like “likes” or “re-tweets” and replies from people who may be 5k miles away from you.

                The anonymity of the internet also reduces civility. People say things to you online that they’d never say to your face. And eventually, this started bleeding over into reducing civility in meatspace, analogous to the pornification of everything which the internet has also wrought. This reduction in civility is why I’ve never been 100% opposed to online ID. You mind your manners better when your name/face is attached to what you say.

And in support of that observation, I give you emoji’s.    🙂
Seriously however, Waay back in the early 80’s *before* the Internet and ubiquitous e-mail, our dept head wrote down a entire page on the proper use of the network communications we had at the time and took note that it should *not* be used for such serious communication among faculty and students precisely noting the lack of visual interaction between communicators.

            Very well stated.  The difference for our side in meatspace is that the left controls meatspace, so it can be less concerned about compartmentalizing – as you put it, being politic about your views.

        “The reason that movement exists is the growing insanity of the people we call the left”
I would say the movement exists not because of the crazies on the left, but because of the cucks and traitors on the so-called right.  If the GOP were doing what GOP voters wanted them to do, Trump could not have won.

        The level of insanity that has taken over leftists is unprecedented.  I’ve been separating from long time “friends” because they’re crazy and I find them to be irredeemable scum. I wish them the worst this life could ever offer.  The other day a friend sent me this:https://x.com/KaeleyT/status/1855962823039565970?s=01.If you think you can co-exist with these monsters, then go join them.  All of these people should be catapulted into space.  The amount of evil here is beyond comprehension.  I do not wish to share the Earth with them, never mind a country.  Then there is this one here:https://x.com/UltraDane/status/1856431394144301572?s=01.These are defective people who deserve nothing less than the worst medieval torture imaginable.  I’m not even being hyperbolic here.

        The Two Minds you speak of are Jung’s Persona and Shadow.The Persona is your socialized self, the normie you inhabit at the day job so you do not shortly die poor and alone. This is the mind people remember fondly from before the days of the internet when everyone seemed normal. The issue with the Persona is that it is a facade, not the true self. The mixed blessing of the Persona is that the restraints it places on an individual often prevent them from knowing what they actually believe which can effectively stabilize what may be an inherently unstable true self.The Shadow is said to be your evil side, the monster within, and people attribute this characterization largely to Jung. This is wrong in that your Shadow is the part of you that interfaces with power, and it just so happens that most people are evil monsters deep down.The internet mind is a mix of the Shadow and an undeveloped, inner identity. One of the great curses of the internet is that various cult-like entities have free reign to kill off an undeveloped identity and replace it with something terrible, but often people will gravitate to groups that share their nascent identity which allows them to mature what they already were together.Power reveals, and the internet provides a virtual playground with virtual power so that people can express the self that lies beneath the Persona. Most of the online crazy is the greater expression of deeply flawed identities and deeply evil Shadows. This is actually a good thing because it allows for corrections to bad identities and a purification of the Shadow in the virtual where most damage is merely psychological. Turning someone into a battered spouse is not the same level of destruction as murder or destroying a company people depend on or leading a nation into a feckless war. A virtual proof of the consequences of an evil Shadow provides real enough incentives to purify the Shadow if one so chooses.The Bible points to a person’s family life as the “virtual space” they use to prove their worthiness of greater social responsibility. The internet is like that, but generalized and less concrete. It allows a person to develop an identity and Shadow that cannot survive contact with reality, which makes it sub par. The internet also unshackles a person’s Shadow and identity from the constraints of the Persona, which allows for purification and corrections to both in a way that is not possible in the real world. Therefore, the internet is revolutionary if utilized for those ends.The Two Minds is optimistically viewed as social growing pains, and less optimistically viewed as the internet providing an early warning system for deeply flawed and corrupt people that are unfit for office and might need to be removed from your life. A greater note from Jung is that a person is not complete until they have incorporated the various aspects of their psyche into a unified whole. Another way to view the Two Minds problem is that most people are false and fractured, the internet has revealed that in a new and profound way, which allows for new, more proactive approaches to correcting that in the hopes of a better nation.Assuming the evil crazies do not burn everything down and the cults do not destroy the world in nuclear fire first. The internet works both ways.

        Things are going to go badly for the True Believers in the Trump threat. Biden just hosted Trump with the biggest sh!t eating grin in his life. You have all these people, RFK Jr., Elon, Joe Rogan, etc. giving Social Proof that Trump is A-OK. Now its Dank Brandon.When the Rapture does not come, people realize everything they believed was a lie. That they were a rube, a sucker, a mark. That the media and every other authority figure they believed was a con.Their whole life was built upon the movie in their head as the heroic resisters. Now they understand they were just marks for a con in a cult.

        The Internet is where emissaries of The Regime say things live in some video format and it is captured and thus accessible forever. These things live in a subculture and finally make it out to the broader public if say, Elon Musk, buys Twitter and spends a decent amount of his time noticing such confessions of evil.Of course there are the endless mental illness confessionals too. If we are good, and we are lucky, the evil things that people like, Ignatiev, Krugman, Baker, Nuland, Albright, Maher, Hanania, Shapiro, endless NGOs … UN apparatchiks … …say and that are recorded and globally visible at the speed of light will wake enough of the right people up to help mitigate the disaster that we are living through and moving toward at increasing speed.Of course, AI chatbots and tour guides that have been trained on anti-Whiteism to worship The God Diversity, are yet another piece on the board will have to be thwarted.

        “…the internet has sucked into it many of our least stable people, empowering them to unleash their craziness in this virtual realm.”Certainly.  Heck, I never talked “politics” as much as I do today—via the “net”, so count me as one of the crazies.  😉  But there *is* a difference between today and yesterday that I think is real, not simply a “proximity” or a communication phenomenon.When I was younger there was a something in society which is now gone.  I long for “a return” to that time.  I can absolutely state I have never said today’s modern society is “bad”, per se.  Rather, I usually surprise everybody by stating exactly the opposite—everything is better!  The litany then follows along the lines of what we would call science and technology developments—cell phones, computers, medical treatment, etc.The end of the litany usually goes, now with all of this, why are we not happy?  At that point, there is usually silence, not dispute.  The conversation is then opened to discussion of meaning and purpose in our new “multi-racial”, Godless society. I’ve yet to hear a sound rebuttal, just a denial of what we all seem to feel in those quiet hours in the night.

            I too rarely talked about politics.  But remember, it is they who forced it on us.Modernity, like most things is a mixed bag.  Though I get what you are trying to point out in people, but everyone loves to pretend everything is way better and refuses to look at the costs of any of the alleged benefits of the status quo today.  We won’t even acknowledge the costs.  We just pretend they aren’t real.We live in the era of magical thinking.  Outsourcing makes us wealthy, diversity is our greatest strength,  men can be women, homos can be married etc.

            On the tech side, I might agree.  On other science side, particularly medicine and food/nutrition, I am not so sure.  It is obvious a lot of science has been bought and paid for providing the desired conclusions per the piper.  Maybe RFK Jr can help.

                Here’s an example.  My mother died of lung cancer in 1994.  She was a terrible smoker and highly nervous person. I was there in the doctor’s office with her.  She was given 4 months with no treatment intervention, 6 months perhaps with surgery and chemo/radiation.  In short, the decision was 6 or so months bedridden and suffering or perhaps 4 reasonable months with no treatment intervention.  Lung cancer was a matter of when, not if you died.Fast forward to 2020 when the last person I’ve known to have died from this disease.  He had lung cancer for 6+ years, such was the improvement in treatment.  Those years were active and useful as well, except for the last few months of recurrence.That’s progress, no matter how you define it.  Examples abound, but one need not list more.

                    No reasonable man can deny the improved efficacy of healthcare over the last century or so. The increased lifespans are the proof. And let’s not overlook improved palliation, as well. Diseases such as prostatitis, which used to make life a living hell, can now at least be palliated to such a degree that life becomes worthwhile for the afflicted.However, as ever, there are unintended consequences. For instance, increased longevity seems an unmitigated good. A no-brainer, right? However, what sorts of years are we adding to life? Are these extra several years spent scaling the south face of Nanga Parbat, kayaking the Colorado, composing the 9th Symphony, and spending time in the bosom of your healthy and happy family? Or are they spent in decrepitude, isolation and gloom? My point is not so much that longevity is a bad thing, but rather that the matter is fraught.

        Regarding the age of contradictions, there are a number of us troubled by Trump’s Israel First or MIGA cabinet picks. “Traitor! Closet kosher!” they cry.As an antisemite of the first order, I had a few moments of concern myself.Therefore I agree with “…balance their internet mind with their material mind.”Rather than hooting with the other monkeys, I realized that this guy had found religion.He almost had his head blown off, and was told by millions it was an act of God.(Something I agree with, in my own way.) He likely sees it that way too.So what if he adopted his daughter’s or old friends’ version. It’s a war religion, that version, and its adherents win a lot. I say he’s found his inner Sampson.Plus, it’s a religion we Aryans seem pretty prone to identify with, for quite a while.Anybody seen these plans he’s been announcing…wow. This is a damn revolution.Sampson Trump is tearing down all their temples, intent on building the Third. Well, if that’s what it takes…I think a lot of people would be quite happy with what will someday be called the coming of the Lord. After all, cultural revolution is what the Coming actually means, anyways.

            The concern, amply justified, is that his MIGA &gt; MAGA, and Israel has been nothing but trouble for the US.  It will drag us into its ME war in which we have no interest, get Iran involved and then tag out with the US to finish it, which may then cause Iran to tag out with Russia and perhaps China, getting us right back into WW III that we have been trying to avoid with Ukraine.  Different paths, same destination.
But I guess that was the deal with devil Trump made to be coronated President.

                You said it better. Reagan had to make a deal with the devil to end the Cold War; Trump has made such a deal to end the Deep State.For both, that requires powerful allies.
Remember, this version always goes to war with other branches of itself, because it’s a war religion proffering ultimate victory. Both sides are certain they are are tools wielded by the righteous Hand.

        Hey Z – why would you include James Lindsay in the same sentence as Obermann as a “crazy”? Lindsay is not like that.

            Anyone care to explain to me the anti-Lindsay sentiment? Puzzled as he is staunchly anti-woke. Tell me what I’m missing.

                He’s a typical kosher centrist.  His big thing right now is saying anyone who questions jews or zionism is automatically the ‘woke right’.  He’s an insufferable gatekeeper.  Like Jesse Kelly, his big thing is supposed to be anti-communism, but he never talks about the progenitors of the ideology…I guess that would be too woke.

            From a 10,000-foot view, I think it’s that Lindsey started off as a rather thoughful left-of-center guy who could engage the right. But as events transpired and he engaged the right more and more online, he went crazy and has retreated into some kind of liberal straitjacket where he tweets asinine things now. Not unlike Jordan Petersen.
