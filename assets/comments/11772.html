        “Hispanics bring elevated levels of crime, but not the rates you see with blacks.”
We’ll see if this holds. It’s hard to be more violent than Blacks, but right now the Hispanics of Honduras and Guatemala are doing it. I’d be willing to bet that, as the number of Hispanics from Central America rises, the differential between Blacks and Hispanics starts to close. The history of Central America is hyper-violent. It’s no wonder Mexica has built a wall on their southern border.

                Rio is a nightmare for sure, but you are off by several orders of magnitude on the overall number of murders there.  Also, Brazil is heavily nigged so their murder rate is in line with their demographics.
Central America’s super high rates of crime may be artificially elevated due to their being proxies between the US and CCCP, during the cold war.  Plus all the drug gangs and so forth.  Still, the ones here need to be sent back.

                    “Central America’s super high rates of crime may be artificially elevated due to their being proxies between the US and CCCP, during the cold war.”
Certainly possible, but the highest country on the list, Honduras, was never really much of an area of proxy warfare, and besides, that was all over a generation ago. I doubt that it helped, but Spain went through a similar experience in the 1930’s, but after a comparable length of time, in the 1960’s, they had the lowest murder rate in Europe.

                                Balderdash. Same on Android Chrome and Win FireFox. That comment is capitalized, your above reply to mine is not.
I realize this is frivolous but you’re a very frequent commenter and it sticks out like a sore thumb when you do capitalize.
And, what do you know, it’s also easier to read your comments that way.
Libertarians around here often don’t deign to capitalize either, Hungus. Food for thought.

                                        Correct. Proper sentences / first-letter capitalization. Karl McH very rarely does this. I deemed it worthy of remark.
It’s not nearly as annoying as ALL CAPS but it does have a similar effect on me. I take the writer less seriously (especially if he’s unfamiliar) and have to read a bit slower.
I’ll admit I have delicate aesthetic sensibilities, especially of those typographical.

Just to show I am a reasonable guy, I will strive to use proper capitalization going forward; in spite of the great pain it causes my thumb-stump.

                I read that 5,000+ were murdered in Rio in 2016. Up 20% from 2015. In Syria, well over 500,000 people have died since fighting began in 2011, more than the U.S. lost in all of WW2. (If that number is admitted to by the West publicly, the real number is probably double that at least.) The cause for death in Syria was attempted regime change, or coup d’etat, of that sovereign nation’s leader Bashar al Assad using proxy forces trained, armed and paid by the U.S. along with some of our Western friends and the Gulf states and, of course silently, Israel. Israel still treats wounded jihadi extremists before sending them back to battle in Syria, or perhaps off to the EU, and from there they can then fly to the U.S., as travel ban does not apply to the EU. It is no civil war in Syria. Never was an organic uprising. Just more bullshit for Israel with mercenaries imported from all over the middle east and europe to overthrow Assad. Iran is next.

            At some point won’t we have to realize that Spaniards and Ameri-Indians are not the same ethnic group?  Obviously I can’t prove my point because no one collects the data, but I strongly suspect that if you took “Hispanics” and subtracted out the white people, the unsavoriness of the remainder would be as disproportionate to their numbers as stereotype would expect.

                My observation (from 28 years living near Los Angeles) is that there are three ethnic groups (naturally there’s been a lot of mixing, but as a broad generalization):Spanish/Euro — pretty much like any other southwest-European. Seldom seen as immigrants, being how they’re also the successful class in Mexico.Big chunky Indians — good workers when they work, not real bright, not much ambition, more or less honest (tho “ownership” can be a flexible concept).Little wiry Indians — higher IQ tho less tractable, often ambitious but flighty and unreliable. I also saw this type coming from South America.Appears to me the big chunky type are probably northern Mexicans, and are less trouble; the little wiry type are more likely to be southern and having little patience with work, more apt to get into the drug trade.Still, either is an improvement over unsupervised Africans.If we’d enforce English as the ONLY language, most of these Mexicans, of any type, would assimilate in a hurry. Not that we need the surplus labor, but that horse is out of the barn and way down the road, so need to deal with what we’ve got.

        The “white” numbers are misleading.  I’ve lived in LA almost my entire 50 years, and a “white” in LA is as likely these days to be an Armenian, a Persian, a Turk, an Arab, Israeli or a North African.
I live a part of town considered one of the WASPier holdouts.  But even here Europeans are now a small proporation of the population.  The past 30 years have been pretty eerie.  A world being washed away.

        what would be really interesting is to know how much of the hispanic violent crime is directed at blacks.  because they are deliberately driving blacks out of california.  that the dems are clearly moving away from nigs in favor of mexicans, is lost on the dim witted negroes.  they don’t stand a chance.  the mexicans will grind the blacks into dust over time until they only exist in pockets of the south (or in protected reserves).

            I was born in L.A. in ’51.  Grew up there. Moved to O.C. to get away from the madness but wound up teaching in Lynwood (first city North of Compton) for 15 years.I watched, firsthand, the displacement of negroes by Mexicans via the classroom within about 10 years.Actually, it was great to see. Once I established classroom dominance (which never took me long to do) the disciplinary problems plunged to almost zero.Not so with the Blacks. They would challenge me almost daily. Detention (HA!) and even weeks long suspension never worked. Parental involvement? Don’t make me laugh.I could count on the fingers of one hand the Blacks I could turn around.But Mexicans? Happened all the time. Parents almost always backed me to the hilt and I have to say I made good friends with some of them. So much so that at Christmas time I was always deluged with homemade tamales. Mmmmmmm.Yeah, the Mexicans hate “Negras” with a passion.They go so far as to mount recon and kill patrols to rid their barrios of troublesome Blacks (and burn down houses if they have to).  I’ve heard it from first-hand accounts from parents and older brothers of my students and even seen it with my own eyes.  Add in a few hard-core Samoans to the mix who *REALLY* hate blacks as they are the hard-core enforcers aligned with the Mexicans in Lynwood and ya got a pretty spicy mix. If there is one crew the blacks did *not* want to fuck with it was the 250+ pound Samoans. With knives and guns.

                Mexican immigration is about two main issues. One is we don’t want southern Mexicans. El Norte’s do fine in America, as they have been a feature of the Southwest since the beginning. Anything further south is trouble. The other issue is simply numbers. We do not have a labor shortage so we do not need to import fresh labor.

        As an increasingly reluctant Angeleno, I appreciate Zman’s breakdown of LA crime data. Most people in LA just want to get along, which really means, to get away, from each other. People prefer to live with their own kind, whatever that kind may be. Progressive efforts to squeeze “diverse” people into the same box fail because such efforts are counter to human nature, which really means, nature, as in biology, as reflected in instinct and culture.LA’s temperate weather must impact criminal behavior in some way. Most of the time, the weather in LA is delightful. We have heat spikes (as in the past few days), but never cross into real cold weather, of the type found in the northeast and midwest. Never. Thus, even our hardened criminals are weather whimps. I encourage an analysis of arrests on rainy days in LA, versus dry days.

        Z Man;Thanks for a *very* informative excursion into the possible future, assuming no ‘black swan’ events.  The best thing is the demonstration of *why* The White Cloud is so fervent about open borders.  They get to stay in charge and now they don’t have to bend the knee to Blacks any more.  Plus cheap servants_!This also explains the sudden increase in agitating Black subversion.  Keeps their minds off noticing that The White Cloud is actively working against their interests  now instead of merely giving lip service while actually ignoring those interest, as the White Cloud did in the past.I used to think that promoting insurrection by a small minority was just historically stupid.  Now we can see it for it’s full, short-sighted, depravity.

        I think over the next 25 years, “Hispanic” or “Latino” will be replaced by something which splits out the white people from those two groups.  As I’ve written before, if you look at the pictures but ignore the surname, you’re looking at white people of various sub-ethnicity.  The Italian guy (Buscaino) is Italian by lineage, for example, but he’s just a generic Liberal White Guy too.
Just having some fun with this simple fact would throw Democrat Party politics into a tail spin pretty quickly.

        Nice research work and conclusions going on here.  Of course, just like the “gun control” controversy, the truth of the thing is irrelevant for those on the other side of the argument.  They will continue to spew their untruths and pretend they are factual, and denounce the facts of the thing as made-up horseshit.  Their followers will take their statements, and regurgitate them as “factual” in a self-referential round-robin.But it is useful to get all of this on the record.  Living here in Southern California, all of the conclusions you are drawing “feel” absolutely correct, at the street level.  The same-old, same-old.  Be wary of groups of Hispanic yutes, especially if there are any visible tattoos.  Stay out of the Black neighborhoods altogether.  Keep to the “good” neighborhoods at night.  Hispanic families out together are OK, Black families not so much.

        You might want to look at El Paso’s stats if they are up.  A decade ago, it was one of the safest large cities in the country for violent crime, but property crime was off the charts.  Across the border in Juarez, more blokes were getting murdered in drug-related violence every week than were getting offed in Baghdad.  And these were vatos from the same families.  Everyone had tios and primos on both sides of the border.You’re right.  Part of it is that new minorities key off the existing elites.  But I’ve always felt that El M had something to do with it also.  Nuestra cosa means more than just clannishness and secrecy.

        I lived in LA for a few years in the Playa del Rey neighborhood.  Despite the name, it’s one of those rich and very white enclaves (we lived in a cheap apartment but right behind a neighborhood of $million+ houses).
Once in a while we would see an LAPD patrol car but not often.  During the 2nd Rodney King trial they were on high-alert.  Out walking the dog I saw them roll by with 4 officers in a car, 3 of them fast asleep.

            Popular politics is an exclusively white phenomenon. Asians appear to vote for the winner, which is a classic minority group characteristic. If you’re a distinct minority, it is wise to support whoever is in charge or at least be viewed that way. I suspect this is why Jews in America vote like Puerto Ricans. Hispanics tend not to vote unless the honky organizes them to vote. They seem to lack the ability to self-organize politically and they easily fall into tribal squabbling.
LA is about to be a good test case of Smart Fraction Theory.

                Vancouver, BC is a good place to look if you wish to see Asian behavior in a western society.  Survey says…  Educated Asians behave as market dominant minorities similar to Jews.  They do not tend to care about the middle class, or seem as concerned about the commons.  The only people who ever care about the commons in any society are those who tend to think of themselves as collective owners of those commons.  Minorities  will always see commons as a resource to exploit.  Whites are not uniquely virtuous in this regard.  As whites become a minority expect them to care little about the environment.  How do my group and I get as much as we can from this system?  This is the question every minority has an inherent incentive to ask.

                Once a few patriarchs in an Asian family decide on what the politics are the entire family goes that way. Not as much racial solidarity as you might think. The last election is a good case in point.

        I wonder if we aren’t over-thinking this? Most of our Cloud People aren’t that bright either. I just don’t see them being bright enough to engineer a population where the beaners bump off the niggers for fun and profit. Sure – they may want that; but they’re far more likely to end up with a 3 to 5 way racial pie fight, with most of the pies being flung at them.The third world is a shithole because of the people that live there. Now they’re here, and of course they are falling into the same grinding poverty they lived in back in their home nations. They are going to bring poverty, pestilence, tribalism, and all the problems they had back at home – with them.America and Europe don’t know how to handle this and a lot of good people are getting hurt as a result. There is no magic dirt, all men are not created equal and no amount of political correctness and affirmative action will change that. The good news is that these problems are going to be dealt with (eventually) the same way they are in the third world: A black beggar passes out in front of you from malnutrition? You just step over him and continue on your way. If he wants to eat he’ll have to work. Some Dindu tries to car-jack you? Ya shoot him and bitch at your buddies over coffee about how some of his brains got splattered on your paint job – but you accept it as part of life with blacks. Obedient Mexican servants will clean up the mess and life goes on. I see the class system re-asserting itself eventually – it can’t do anything else. It’ll just take time – and a lot of good people are going to get hurt along the way…

        I reject the idea that majority-minority is inevitable for the United States.  There are several ways to avoid this problem, some uglier than others, but all will work.
All it takes is a leader, a small band of dedicated lieutenants, and millions will follow.

                Right, just wanted clarification for that reason. When most people talk about “Elllayy” they usually include lots of parts that are not in the city.

            K Simp, your remark is much less a comment about the alleged “buffoons” than about yourself. Key word: “considered”, used with the passive voice.Likewise, “extreme right” is a comment about communists’ extreme deviance in favor of the ugliest politcs. I would agree, however, that most right wingers are buffoons who represent no significant threat to totalitarians. It worked the same way in Russia, more or less, when the czar, a sentimental Jew worshipping twit, tilted leftward. Then came people like Kerensky. Then Lenin, Stalin, et al.The contemporary situation in America implies that your evident fear of the “extreme” right is unfounded. It has no basis in reality. Such fear is known as a phobia.
