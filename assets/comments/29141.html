            I appreciate the link.
The reality is that everyone I know owns a few birds and harvests their own eggs.
It‚Äôs really not that hard.
To the people still in cities? Good luck.

        The redux is: America is a free for all where every piece and parcel is for sale to a highest bidder ‚Äì most of them foreign.Our biggest threat is The Great Replacement. There are two sides to it: the homeland invasion by aliens; the psychological and cultural denigration, demonization and subjugation of our people.To Z‚Äôs point, there is no voting our way out of it, and the Republican party must die. Here are the prime examples:Rep. Congresswoman Maria Salazar at the WEF fighting for illegal aliens who, ‚Äúlook like her and speak the same language as her.‚Äùhttps://twitter.com/i/status/1615399960144662528Here is her husband and now you see who she represents:https://woernerholdings.com/about-us/our-team/lester-woerner/of Woerner HoldingsThen there is the brand new Mexican embassy in Oklahoma City brought to you by Republican Governor Kevin Stitt. The head of the embassy is Mexico‚Äôs Edurne Pineda ‚Äì who looks just like the migrants too. (sic) The embassy is Mexico‚Äôs 51st in the US that sits at the crossroads of all major interstates that flow through the heartland.America is gone. All energies must be spent preparing for life in a new, nation? country? economic zone?, as a despised minority. It isn‚Äôt hopeless, but we have to put all of our energy into ourselves and our families and lay the groundwork for surviving and flourishing in an entirely new environment. Electoral politics and whining is futile.

                Yep. Here is my prediction. The system is setting up for a Carlyle Group ticket of Youngkin/Sears in ‚Äô24. The day after the mid terms Sears our magical friend announced Trump was finished.
Mark my words, Youngkin/Sears will check all of the boxes in ‚Äô24. The most important one being, they are the managers/owners, errrr key stakeholders rather, of The Potomac Regime.

            Z: ‚ÄúWhoever is getting this story into the media has real power and motivations they will never reveal publicly.‚ÄùWhoever‚Äôs power is that they OWN the entirety of the media.Whoever‚Äôs motivation is to get Mr Kamalatoe Harris, aka Douglas Emhoff, installed in the Oval Orifice, so that Emhoff can convince the little lady to incinerate Christian Russia.200 Years TogetherChapter 1: Before the 19th centuryFrom the Beginnings in KhazariaAnatevka, Anatevka,Underworked, overfed, Anatevka,Where else could Shabbat be so sweet?‚ÄúWell, there is no famine.‚Äù‚Äì Meir Henoch Wallach (Finkelstein)Nom-de-guerre, ‚ÄúMaxim Litvinov‚ÄùGareth Jones‚Äôs Diary, March 1933Yes, Whoever really is that sadistic and that psychopathic.Whoever will incinerate the entire world if that‚Äôs what it requires for Whoever to emerge victorious.Furthermore, Whoever chose the marionettes in this tragedy [Lloyd J.

            We also now have the return of the threat of nuclear war. Medvedev just warned that the defeat of Russia would lead to nuclear war. Currently there are plans to ‚Äúsend tanks‚Äù (which means basically a NATO led invasion army since it takes about 18 months to train tankers and associated infantry in combined arms, a tank is not Honda Civic that anyone can drive and maintain) to ‚Äúdefeat Russia‚Äù and remove Putin, stage war crime tribunals, and break up Russia and put it under Western Administration.Putin and Russia‚Äôs weakness invited this attack. Failure to crush Ukraine quickly and brutally has invited this move. Weakness like an old Asian lady on the Manhattan A train just invites some vibrant person of diversity to attack. That is the way of human behavior.Garland and the DOJ are protecting Biden in the documents stuff, but stuff keeps coming out, presumably some Deep State actor like Hillary! sees her chance and also wants nuclear war with Russia for reasons. Because. Hell.To.Pay. And so forth. So give neo-cons their credit, they‚Äôve also pushed global nuclear war to the forefront, a not inconsiderable achievement.

                Whiskey: ‚ÄúSo give neo-cons their credit, they‚Äôve also pushed global nuclear war to the forefront, a not inconsiderable achievement.‚ÄùAnd yet, a mere four decades prior, their propaganda had informed all of us idiot goyim that it was simply unthinkable, and that even an Intel 80286 processor could figure that out.https://tinyurl.com/8fyjdbznIntellectual consistency was never exactly y‚Äôall‚Äôs strong point.==========Wargames was written by Lawrence Lasker, whose father, Edward Lasker, was very strongly Early-Life‚Äôd, as was his grandfather, Albert Davis Lasker.BTW, Edward Lasker owned the Chicago Cubs, but Edward Lasker‚Äôs wife, Caral Gimbel, of the Gimbels department store fortune, ran off with MLB hall-of-famer Hank Greenberg, of the Detroit Tigers.Greenberg was a huge guy; he towered over Gehrig and DiMaggio.https://tinyurl.com/mv6258vy==========Ironically enough, though, the TV movie, from the same era, called ‚ÄúThe Day After‚Äù, was written by a goy, named Edward Hume.

        I agree that ‚Äúthe system‚Äù selects for schemers and scammers, but that always proves to be ‚Äúthe system‚Äôs‚Äù downfall. That kind of person just can‚Äôt stop scamming, even when there‚Äôs nothing to gain and everything to lose. Just as Bill Clinton would rather scale Mt. Everest in order to lie to you, rather than stand still and tell you the truth (I think because he got a literal sexual thrill from lying), so his idiot wife can‚Äôt stop pulling ever-dumber and ever-more-elaborate capers. They‚Äôre already rich beyond the dreams of avarice, and have all the power in the world. The only thing that revs their motor anymore is scamming for scamming‚Äôs sake. They‚Äôre addicts, and that‚Äôs what gets them caught. And while they have nothing to worry about from getting caught by the ‚Äúauthorities,‚Äù much less the People, getting caught by other, better scammers can be fatal‚Ä¶

            The scams and schemes fund their sociopathy. The system selects for sociopaths and so they are its face. The Clintons, Romneys and so forth are sociopathic middlemen, in other words.

                The proper way to view it is the Clinton‚Äôs CAN‚ÄôT be charged. The only ‚Äúleader‚Äù who possibly could have been was Trump. Gangster states like this one only can charge or extrajudicially terminate those outside the Families. To do otherwise is to set off a gang war that would make Mario Puzo blush. If you scratch below the surface of the JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the common denominator is it was a retaliatory hit to avenge a family, be it Hoffa, Diem, or Johnson.When you realize these people CAN‚ÄôT be charged rather than WON‚ÄôT be charged, everything becomes crystal clear. The United States is a wealthier Congo or Chicago/Chimpcongo circa 1924, pick your poison.

        ‚Äú Either way, the place to look here is the bother, not the son.‚ÄùAt a low level of observation, yes.  But at the 30,000 foot level, no.  The story here (IMHO) is more who is ‚Äúbehind the curtain?‚Äù  Someone or some cadre, unelected, unknown, perhaps loosely organized/co-ordinated, is running the country and it is *not* the elected representatives of the people‚Äîcorrupt as those elections are now known to be, they still create a plausible aura of the dirt people ‚Äúin charge.‚ÄùThose ‚Äúelected‚Äù dirt people representatives for the most part are in thrall to this invisible power.  Nothing changes until they are ferreted out.  The Biden affair, as the Clinton affair is simply a side show for the rubes.  At worse, they go to jail or the morgue, but nothing changes and the play roles onto the next act with a new set of players.A demented old fool was brought forth and put into office through no will of the people.  Now that that demented old fool has become a liability, he is being removed so that the next stooge can be put in the position and carry on the farce of elected representation, i.e., democracy.That is the 30,000 foot view.

            This is a factional turf war. It may be to get Biden out of the way, and it may be leverage to get something out of him, possibly American troops slaughtered in Ukraine. Biden is a despicable, evil man, but never discount what follows or the reason behind the hit may be far worse.

        I think this is an excellent analysis of the situation and gets closer to what is really going on than most of what I read. That said, I have to think about regimeology and wonder why it is coming out now. A lot of people are saying this is because ‚Äúthey‚Äù want Biden out. Maybe they were hoping a ‚Äúred wave‚Äù would force him to step down for 2024, but that didn‚Äôt materialize because of mail-in shenanigans and the red team losing on purpose. So now they push this out there and keep leaking stuff. I‚Äôm not totally convinced, though, as Vegetable Biden has been a productive figurehead for the regime. Everyone knows Biden isn‚Äôt running the show, but it‚Äôs a useful fiction. Why end that now?

                Completely agree. If they wanted Biden removed, it would not be too hard. Just have his handlers send him in front of the cameras with no teleprompter, and it would not be long before he would be booted (and we would have some fun viewing for a while). Though, to be fair, I do not know if they even need to put pressure on him for the escalation. The confused old man will do and read whatever is put in front of him. Who knows?

        A bit off topic, but Saudi Arabia has publicly stated they are open to the idea of selling oil in currencies other than the Dollar.

                I have commented on this issue several times here. Plutonium triggers have a design life of twenty years. The last one was made in 1989, over thirty years ago. We have no idea whether our nukes will work.
They used to build them at Rocky Flats, just south of Boulder. The facility has been shuttered for over twenty years. A beautiful new subdivision sits on the land.
So it goes in Clown World.

                    This situation may have something to do with the Biological Warfare gambit. That can be sort of like neutron bombs, as Frank Zappa explained ‚Äúto poof them out of existence, while leaving their real estate right where we can use it‚Äù.
So many biological laboratories in such close proximity to Russia there were in Ukraine. Elsewhere around the world as well, but that‚Äôs a pretty high number of these ‚Äúresearch‚Äù laboratories in Ukraine, no?

            Totally OT, and rambling I‚Äôm sure, but this petrodollar talk has me daydreaming. Petrodollar means oil is purchased with dollars, right? And there‚Äôs talk of energy-backed currencies‚Ä¶The dollar is a debt now, right? Debt is a claim against future productivity, and productivity takes energy.Internet research says BOE = 5.8 million BTU, so (thought experiment) let‚Äôs say the value of a dollar is pegged at 58000 BTU, like it was once pegged to a certain amount of gold. So, like a debt, you‚Äôre still trading in energy and in the sense it‚Äôs still a claim against future productivity, because the world runs on energy. Good idea or not?Where that gets interesting for me is that it‚Äôs a particular kind of productivity‚Äî the kind done by machines, because people don‚Äôt run on oil. Further, work done by machines has replaced slavery. We live ‚Äòhigher‚Äô lives by ‚Äòstealing‚Äô the labor of machines instead of other people. And the machines never revolt or work off the debt.Yet we still have money that represents a debt other people have to pay, the will to dominate, the moral crusaders, etc. It‚Äôs as if we either haven‚Äôt evolved out of old habits, or those habits are an immutable part of human nature.Evolution/immutability is a well-worn and perpetually-argued topic‚Äî also the disruptive effect of technology on society and hierarchy. Hard to not see it as a species-wide useless eater problem in these terms. Not just with the hoi polloi, but kings and aristocrats, too. Everybody increasingly freaking out because everybody increasingly obsolete.Also the moral angle, the slave as indebted, low, bad, sinful. The machine doesn‚Äôt care, so people can‚Äôt take glee in or pity on its plight. The shame of being bad, the pride of being good‚Äî all out the window‚Äî because machines run on a different kind of energy than people.And to take it way out there, as I enjoy doing, our creation is killing us, just as we supposedly killed our creator, because it isn‚Äôt returning the energy we invested in it in a form that nourishes us. We‚Äôre spending ourselves. That‚Äôs not the machines‚Äô fault. They know not what they do üòÜNot that I think it‚Äôs some brilliant and novel insight on my part. As always, kind of dumb about this stuff, but it seems like something that‚Äôs been between the lines of the revolutionary foment and tumult of the Enlightenment and modernity that I missed, or couldn‚Äôt put together, or something like that. Maybe just a different way of looking at it that I‚Äôm finding exciting.My mind‚Äôs blown anyway ü§£ Sorry for being long-winded. Hopefully it‚Äôs at least entertaining.

                Someone has to build the machines. Someone has to put the machines to use productively. Someone has to repair, replace and improve the machines. The machines can‚Äôt do everything.The machines have created a massive surplus of material wealth. It was consumed off by the pincer movement from above and below of parasitical classes. Some connivers came up a way to forestall the debt reckoning. As the reckoning has been forestalled there has been a runway to subsidize far worse and more destructive projects than too much debt ‚Äì replacement migration; large and diffuse sinecures of cultural cancer in every institution; malinvestment in money making enterprises that produce no or a net negative value/good ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Machines in a society that knows how to utilize them for their net good and confine and restrict their net harms are an incredible asset. A liberal democracy with a welfare state, military empire, egalitarian fantasies masking tribal warfare ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt constrain the machines development and useTheir surplus wealth has been extracted. Witness the ever expanding debt. It isn‚Äôt the machine‚Äôs fault that we gave up on having better men beat down and stave off lesser men to do something positive with the surplus wealth the machines gave us.What we and our posterity build out of the ruins will have to take into account the systemic and human failings that lead to them and do better next time. On the positive side, the types of machines at our disposal will be incredible once better men decide which are developed and utilized to our advantage.

            It‚Äôs not hard to believe that somewhere along the way he did some laundering for someone, but that doesn‚Äôt appear to me to have been the primary purpose of the enterprise. I believe the story that he died in prison, which they wouldn‚Äôt have allowed to happen if he were doing all this in service of the regime. Maybe he was never incarcerated, maybe he‚Äôs living somewhere else with a new face and a fake ID, in which case the joke‚Äôs on me, but I more or less buy the official story in the Madoff case. There were an awful lot of folks involved in digging through the wreckage of that and it would be  hard to keep them all quiet if they had suspicions.

        As far as Hunter‚Äôs involvement, I‚Äôm sure the Bidens knew his issues and limitations, but they were forced to use him much more when the older son Beau (the saint) died.  I have a feeling that he was originally working in Hunter‚Äôs role, the more responsible, older son, and Hunter was more of a high living courier.  They were likely in a bind and Hunter became front and center in the transactions, crack addiction and all.

        ‚ÄúThe angle that the conservative media is pursuing is that Biden‚Äôs reckless handling of secret material was far worse than what they are accusing Trump of doing. Trump kept his secrets in a big vault guarded by the secret service, not a crack addict.‚ÄùThey are also forgetting Donald Trump was President and could declassify documents at will for any reason or no reason whatsoever.  He is head of the executive branch of the government and the commander and chief of the military.From what I understand, all these documents are from when Biden was VP.

        First, that most politicians are corrupt is the equivalent of saying that water is wet. Second, in a healthy and properly functioning government there should be checks &amp; balances as a first resort and law enforcement as the ultimate deterrent. The Clinton‚Äôs masterstroke was to compromise and then own the Stasi, who now function solely as a Praetorian Guard for the DC Citadel. What was supposed to be a premier law enforcement organization has morphed into a covert criminal enterprise. It is the reason that corruption in DC has run amok; everyone is on the take. No one should ever trust anyone in that organization again. It needs to be disbanded and rebuilt from the ground up, and there are agents in the hinterlands who will freely admit this.But do not be fooled again about the new Republican House of Representatives and their zeal to pursue ‚Äúinvestigations‚Äù of corruption, nor the recent appointment of another Special Prosecutor. Both are carny shows designed to throw faux red meat to the slobbering masses of couch potatoes. It‚Äôs all an act to appease peasant rage with the illusion of meaning corrective action. The best we can do in the short term is ignore them and use one‚Äôs time and effort is more tangible ways that have personal impact.

                The new Stasi would ideally have a limited charter to only investigate corruption and criminality by federal public employees (including politicians) and foreign-origin criminal acts. All citizen-based criminal acts should fall solely within the purview of the individual States, with jurisdiction establish by either origination of the criminal act or a preponderance of adverse impact. This is not significantly different from the current regional jurisdictions of the Federal Court System.
And the Patriot Act needs to be rescinded in its entirety.

            I disagree in one regard.  It should be torn down and then left torn down.  Rebuilding from the ground up would create the same results.

            It could be that Biden‚Äôs inner circle is getting cold feet about throwing money down the Ukraine rathole, so they roll this out to make sure he knows who is his daddy. I would not put it past them. I‚Äôve also speculated that it is a flex by the FBI to let Congress know to tread lightly in their probe. if they can take out a president and former president, imagine what they will do to a congressman.

                        You may be correct about her motivations, but it is only a couple of years to the next Presidential election, and she might do this in the interim, all while working the bureaucracy for advantage. But maybe she is too impulsive to play that strategy. Time only could tell.

                    But that‚Äôs the problem, how senile or what rationality remains in the ‚Äúold coot‚Äù?  Could it have been he was to be a one term president (by tacit agreement at least) and now has‚Äîin his advanced decline‚Äîreneged?  Does Biden care that his son is likely to be put away before him?

        Granted, no system is perfect, but democracy is built for this kind of chicanery and selects for people willing to do it. In a system controlled by various powerful families, there‚Äôs no need to graft the system. You are the system, and you‚Äôre already rich. You also want the system to succeed so your children and grandchildren can run and benefit from it.Of course, that kind of system has its own problems. Again, no system is perfect.Regardless, the fact that the Clintons and the Bidens are not only still around but are accepted (even celebrated) by the elite shows our place in the timeline of fall of the Republic. The old rules are being ignored. The institutions are being used for personal gain. The respect for the past is gone.This is terminal. We‚Äôre never going to return to the respect for the old rules and institutions. We‚Äôre heading toward either a break-up where different regions create their own republics based on rules and institutions that their people do respect and honor, or we‚Äôre heading toward Sulla and Caesar.

            &gt; We‚Äôre heading toward either a break-up where different regions create their own republics based on rules and institutions that their people do respect and honor, or we‚Äôre heading toward Sulla and Caesar.In the medium term, more likely than not, states will still pay tribute to Washington via taxing its population while ignoring the vast majority of its edicts.  Most people in D.C. will feel fine with the arrangement, as they get their fancy titles and high quality of life.The governors of the states will be de facto emperors which will make places like Florida and New York seem like entirely different countries with regard to laws.  In some states hat can‚Äôt keep order, it will essentially devolve into the modern version of local warlords.If media remains a monolith though, over time the states will homogenize again as information control by technology companies solidifies its grip and the next generation grows up without even knowing bad thoughts exist.  It won‚Äôt be just federal re-homogenization either, but through all the Western world and any nation unable to resist western regime change.

                Yes, the media definitely can shape populations everywhere. However, people (well, men) are slowly coming around to not trusting the media. OTOH, women will always be susceptible to the media. It‚Äôs their nature.
But we always have one thing on our side: The current system doesn‚Äôt work on the ground. That matters.

        The corruption is so deep and brazen that most people can‚Äôt even feign outrage anymore if they care at all. With the Clintons, their wealth is so large and acquired so corruptly that it‚Äôs almost like the big lie analogy. Too outrageous and in our faces to be so illegal, but there it is.If the bought off media wasn‚Äôt the same we may have not gotten to this point. They are all rich or super rich, many after entering office. Campaign finance and the laws regarding personally sequestering one‚Äôs finances when entering office are now gone.Apathy rules the day with the average citizen when confronted with this . That‚Äôs if they are made aware of this considering most peoples choice of news sources.

I think I read on Blab that Pelosi was selling off stocks and bonds en mass. I wonder if it is because the old b*tch knows something‚Ä¶ or that now she is out of the loop, she wants to grab her money and run because she no longer has an inside track‚Ä¶?

        ‚ÄúThis is why Joe Biden was sprinkling secret documents all over the place. You see, his son and brother had access to the family homes and offices. If Joe were to carelessly leave secret documents at these places, totally by accident because he is getting old and forgetful, Hunter and Jim could accidentally stumble upon them. Maybe they would see something in those files that they could use in their dealings with the foreign players like China and Ukraine.‚ÄùAbductive reasoning at its finest.

        I‚Äôm so fed up with all the corruption that I don‚Äôt even pay much attention anymore. Why even watch the evening news? Go walk your dog instead, but don‚Äôt forget to duck! Car jacking, stabbing, murder in the big city not news anymore. A big news headline would be that no one got shot.Look at all the trend lines. Is anything improving? No. Will anything soon improve? No. So pay less attention, go walk your dog, Boy Scout motto, be prepared. Know that the day of reckoning is coming. Debt crisis, nukes, or total anarchy. Too much psychological stress unhealthy. Take in just enough to get you to be prepare. Have a bug out plan, or relocate to a bug out place.

                    There are rumors running around that the interior ministry was trying to horn in on the army‚Äôs illicit arms trade. We know a lot of the stuff being sent to Ukraine is being sold on the black market. For example, there was a very credible claim that back in the summer a Ukrainian commander sold a complete HIMARS to the Russians. There were pics to go along with it. Given how the Russians quickly found way to counter the HIMARS, it fits with what we see. Of course, there are those pics of vehicles and small arms turning up in the Balkans.These guys are not stupid. Everyone in Ukrainian leadership is planning their own landing spot after the war. If the interior minister threatens that, killing him makes perfect sense. No man, no problem.
