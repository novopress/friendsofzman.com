        Everyone is obsessed with rummaging around in the pastI agree with this. But it is easy to understand why people do this, especially when the past held so many great personal and collective memories.Despite what newly-minted Leftist Thought Control Tsars might tell us, the collected European history of (andespeciallyof) the last 300 years is one well documented march of the unrestrained determination, kindness, intellect and industry of white men. And I include the US in this too, seeing that she was really a seed of Europe.Not only did the great materialism bring with it the most affluent and pleasant lifestyles ever enjoyed by humanity, it was brought about by some incredible characters. Things we really take for granted now, and even things that seem antiquated now (like the steam  locomotive) can be looked upon and marvelled at.Let us think of such things for a moment:The first clock to measure time reliably; essential for navigation.Rubber and plastics: game changers.Mass production.Steam and fuel-oil engines.Modern processes for iron and steel making.The transistor.Swathes of knowledge pertaining to the natural sciences: take one look at Maxwell’s equations and marvel at how a mind can develop that – and that they stood up against experiment.Modern naval architectural practices.Road, canal and rail networks.The legacy is so vast, so impressive, and sowithout parallel, that even though our “countries” and our “leaders” which for us to forget it and deride it, we must keep the spirit of it alive by marvelling at it. By regaling others with the tales of it. By keeping it close to our hearts.By saying: that’s whatour peopledid.We can detach from the present Evil, of course. But we must have in our spirits the fine work of those, much better men, that came before us.God bless all here.

            Regarding your list of White accomplishments, check out the musical skit in the Family Guy episode, “Thank the Whites”.  Hilarious, yet absolutely true.  It’s still on YouTube… for now.

                All fun aside — and keeping in mind it’s just a comedy show — it’s not likely the trivial “accomplishments” portrayed there are going to get that video pulled from YouTube.

                Diversity Heretic,
As I was reading my comment back to myself I thought about this! Thanks for the inclusion, undoubtedly, along with proper sanitation and sewer systems, the key to our massively increased longevity!
Should also have mentioned the extraction of crude oil and all of it’s various by-products.

            Concomitant with that list of accomplishment was the art, architecture, music, literature, and poetry which accompanied this impressive list of scientific/industrial achievements. There are no real competitors to Mozart, Palladio, Da Vinci, Tolstoy or Virgil and their compatriots. Go to the great European cities and museums and you will find them crowded with Asians, Muslims, Indians…people from all over the world want to see and experience what our people have accomplished. Non-Europeans have never been able to write music like this:https://tinyurl.com/bddydb36

                Good points.  Those are also vital elements of the West.  And so are the theological and philosophical schools of thought, from the Greeks through the Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment and later thinkers.
Also, the spirit and accomplishment of the great explorers.
The list is a very long one that needs to be treasured and passed down to the future generations.

The spirit of the great explorers, indeed. That’s something I’m glad you mentioned, because I don’t think I’ve ever been more thrilled reading about people, than about those great men.
Such adventures. Sad though, as that world has gone forever.
Some of the Spanish conquistadors had some brilliant tales. They died in horrid ways, but they sure had eventful lives!

                        Thanks, OrangeFrog. I agree with you completely. And many of the explorers were admirable in various ways. Sir Francis Drake, for example, was a great leader, courageous, and filled with a spirit of fair play. LaSalle and some of the other French explorers also amazed me. And John Smith. Well, the list is long, isn’t it? None of them were perfect, but they accomplished more than 99.9% of us do today.Columbus, of course, is continually being trashed, but he helped get the ball rolling, after the Portuguese, and he had admirable traits also. He has been continually misrepresented especially since ca. 1992.And thanks for initiating this discussion.In “higher ed” and with trash such as Howard Zinn’s book, the writing was on the wall decades ago, that all of this heritage would be threatened.

                            One key thing to recall about Columbus is that he sailed the high seas, where death and disease were all too frequent, before John Harrison invented his clocks that kept accurate time on ocean going ships. This meant they could deduce their longitude correctly.These men, whatever their faults, were cut from such different cloth from the man of today, that it boils my blood to hear them trashed by people who have never considered that, hey, 500 years ago, fellows maynothave aligned very much with modern principles.Different times. High adventure. Derring-do. It’s true life was very hard for a large number of people, but it does seem that, in many case, those who risked life and limb, where amply rewarded with spoils from the new world.

                                Down here in Argentina, the Milei gov just re-renamed Columbus Day (Día de la Razain Spanish) from some recently invented leftie name like “Indigenous People and Assorted Others Day” or some such. The chainsaw is going Texas-style massacre on a lot of the bullshit we’ve suffered under for the 20 years I´ve been here. It’s wonderful! Defunding bs university stuff, breaking apart the nepotistic version of the IRS and SocSec bureaucracies…Tonight I make a rare nocturnal outing (I’m 78) to attend a meeting of the newly-launched local branch of theLa Libertad Avanzaparty of which I’m a charter member. I haven’t been this enthusiastic about politics since Pat Buchanan ran for president back in the old country.

                                    Great to hear about Milei.  I’m glad the chainsaw is still at work.  Some on the right were dismissive of him because of his libertarianism, and apparent connections with the WEF.  But he went to the WEF, I believe, and gave a fairly forthright speech to them, and seems to be following through with some of his positive ideas.  The university stuff is very important, and their stranglehold needs to be broken up here.I’ll never forget the film I saw of a middle-aged Argentinian man running up to Milei during the campaign, grasping his hands, and pleading with him to save their nation.  I had some Argentinian friends whom I sadly lost touch with.  I hope you keep doing well down there.

                                        It could be a very hopeful sign. Leftist brainwashing has been intense and long term in the US but less so around the world. A lot of what drives global Leftism is the cultural (and military) imperialism of the US rather than any real belief in Globohomo “values” among the people. As the American Empire weakens and is forced to focus more on preserving itself in the core nations, (basically the US, Canada, and the UK) it will jettison less important areas around the periphery such as Argentina. Eventually, even people in the imperial core will start to appreciate these examples of peripheral nations demonstrating that there’s nothing inevitable about the march of the Leftist perpetual revolution.

            Stupendous accomplishments in the arts and philosophy are easily the equal of those in the sciences. Rococo cathedrals, impressionism, symbolism, abstraction, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Poe, Dostoevsky, Goethe, Twain, Kant, Heidegger, Hegel, Neitzsche–I could go on an on and barely scratch the surface. Add up the accomplishments of the rest of the world over the last three centuries and they pale utterly compared to what the Occident and the Anglosphere wrought.

                Ostei,
You are of course correct. I meant no denigration to the arts (when we could call them those), but for me personally they always took a distinct second place, probably as I’m a bit uncultured in these matters.
I appreciate the beauty of classical music, and gawk in amazement at a Rembrandt masterpiece, but I think a bit of it is lost on me. On the other hand, show me one of Thomas Telford’s bridges, and I’m awestruck!
I do wish I could appreciate the arts a bit more, I guess it’s just me mind.

            Great post!
One thing we must also celebrate are our Greco-Roman-Nordic roots in philosophy, legal systems, social orders.
We are in this mess because we turned all of our attention toward technology and our destructive impulses toward dismantling Our unparalleled social technology and our knowledge of who should be permitted authority and who should never be permitted authority.
Those achievements turned out to be unsung and monumental in importance. Without them the technological and exploration achievements are meaningless and destructive.
Amazing post though. Have a beautiful weekend.

            I am flummoxed by this idea that we should “close the door to the past” as if that were even possible, let alone desirable.  There are aspects of the past that are never coming back. But there are many aspects of the past still with us and desirable and many aspects of the past that can and should come back.Even now, as we speak, we are learning painful lessons that require a return to aspects of the past.  Having an industrial society, for example.  Without it, we will eventually be a very poor bit player in the world.  We should not be planning for a glorious future where the rest of the world’s job is to makes stuff and it’s our job to consume it.  The idea that this is some new and permanent feature of the world that we must come to expect is false.The attempt to bury the past just leads to cultural vandalism and corpses.  Mao’s China is a perfect example of this. They were creating the new socialist man. They just had to get rid of the “Four Olds”

                The erasure and wild misrepresentation of the Western past serves the purpose of isolating us temporally and destroying the essence of what makes white people white (and great). Then, so unmoored from anything substantial, we lose our identity and can no longer function as a tribe. At that point, eliminating the white race is like shooting fish in a barrel. Our past is our existence, and its elimination constitutes an existential attack.

Yes.  I’ve read people saying that fighting back about our past should be a lower priority.  I strongly disagree.  It needs to have very high priority.  We can easily see how the trashing of our past has demoralized so many whites.

                    Well said. This is the moment where we act like victims and display learned helplessness, or we take preserving and transmitting our past, our identity and our vision for our future into our own hands.We are at this moment because we took this for granted and left it into other people’s hands. Were we a single ethnos/culture we would and could have gone astray and been able to come back to it during some inevitable crisis. Moreover, the crisis would have strengthened and further defined this identity that we call peoplehood or a nation.However, we took this for granted and forfeited control over it when America had three competing ethnic groups plus an emerging Leviathan state. Now it is a chaotic environment. The two rival ethnic groups are extremely organized and have granted themselves legal/first-class citizenship, turned us into a minority and made us the villain. They import a new people, a conglomeration of countless tribes, and teach them all that we are the root of all evil in order to make them a single tribe by virtue of us as a common enemy. The worst part of our legal status is that we are villains by virtue of speaking on our own behalf. We have to put a stop to that. That is us preventing ourselves from mounting a moral and necessary defense and counter-offensive.It is not a good position that we are in. However, there are tens of millions of us who will not go quietly and we have many attributes. Once we exercise them and assert our will we will put a stop to the death spiral and see better days though the storm will be rough.Whether or not we have the maturity and courage to take the cultivation of our heritage and identity back will determine if we survive and if our great grandchildren and beyond can carve out new environments where they can thrive.

That does seem to be Z’s wont, though: to disdain the past and fixate on the nebulous prospect of building a new society on the ruins of the old. It all seems just a bit too Jacobin for me, all due respect to our host notwithstanding.

            Lots of mistakes, too.
Why not, rather than this cyclical notion of growth and collapse, or the endlessly forward-pointing line, an iterative notion: you go out, you make mistakes, you return and learn lessons, you go out again.
It’s progress without Progress!, endings without The End.

            Nicely articulated post.I don’t know if it’s been mentioned, but I’m pretty sure Whitey is going to survive the current shit show. It’s just going to suck. Will some knowledge be lost? Maybe. I recently bought actual books, including the Bible, War and Peace,( an underrated story), Atlas Shrugged. I think you get what I’m cooking.The most important thing to have, in addition to the usual preps, is “want too”.
Desire.

                Loss of knowledge is not unheard of. Many Roman engineering and artistic techniques disappeared and have not been recovered. And people interested in ancient metaphysics decry the loss of knowledge from the mystery cults that vanished in the third, fourth and fifth centuries.

            “Everyone is obsessed with rummaging around in the past,,,It means closing the door on the past and those past ideas. The future is a terrifying….”I’m thinking it means we close the door on the idea of “understanding”.  Man’s brain is wired to “understand”.  Has been since we came down from the trees to the savanna.  That’s not to say we always had the “correct” understanding.  Just that the need was there.  What we could not figure out, we explained through the “gods”, then as we developed through “science”.  All those were backstops to our primordial fear of powerlessness against nature and ultimately death.  Self realization, which only man possesses, is a bitch.

        Try convincing normies that America is gone and it’s never coming back.  Their answer to you is that the orange man will win a legitimate election and fix everything by replacing White people “legally”, giving “platinum plans” to violent negros and cutting the corporate tax rate.
As bad as things would be, I’m torn about whether the cackling whore being installed in dubious fashion wouldn’t be the best thing for the future of this economic trading zone.
There is only one way to fix this and defeat evil, you have to remove it.  That is the only way.

            Tired Citizen:  I’m with you, and in so many ways just want to get it all over with.  But my husband has also made solid points about why, even though we know it will only be a short -term and very limited respite, he wants Trump to win.  Either way it’s best to plan for the worst.  I’ve been skimming lots of YT videos about “after Helene/Milton” and so many people are admitting they’d grown complacent, or thought “I have chickens and will be okay.”  So many who had no idea how many watts their precious coffee makers required, or who buy everything with a card.  We know, election or not, AINO is failing.  It is always good to be more self reliant and not to rely on fallible men to ‘fix’ things for you.

                    Nope.  He’s come a long way towards my view on things, although we still have disagreements on many smaller issues.  This doesn’t mean that he (nor I) is any less passionate about our values and beliefs than anyone else here; we just don’t think electoral politics today are going to change anything.  Fwiw, it wouldn’t make any difference where we live, which has always been very conservative.

                    As I said, I would, and *did* vote for Trump after not voting 2 years ago for the first time in my civic life. Not inclined to do so again. But actually glad for this one last time as in those short 4 years, the “world turned upside down” as the saying goes.Some observations—Here in AZ we no longer have precincts. We have a limited number of voting centers. This means two things I immediately see. 1) All voter registration is now electronic and dependent on the internet. 2) All ballots are printed on the scene.This seems ripe for fraud. The data base of all registered voters must be protected from view and tampering. The blank ballots are available to all for the cost of a printer. Now if I know who voted and who did not and I have a fistful of blank ballots because they are not kept record of….Further observation was even worse. The ballot that was given to me came with an “envelope” and instructions as to how to fold my filled out ballot—sign the envelope, and drop it into the box upon leaving the voting center. There were people also using the drop boxes for their *mail-in* ballots! They stepped into the center and walked up to the box and fed their envelopes in as well.So my question is, “Did I just perform a mail in ballot process *without* the use of the USPS for delivery?”I think I have, but need to followup on whether or not some bozo is checking my signature from the envelope against my electronic registration. In any event, even the dumbest voter will leave the new voting centers thinking they’ve made a useless effort to vote at a “center”, rather than by mail. This of course is the whole purpose of the endeavor!Next stop, voting by Internet…and so it goes.

                            The “other side” is not playing by certain rules and are not afraid to intimidate and punish.  Whether one votes or not *is* public, but the person’s choice is not—and should not be.  The aspect of access to voting data as in who has or has not voted “before” the election is over allows false votes to be injected into the system. Hence, an online database with realtime updating—as required in today’s vote centers—is problematic if accessed for fraudulent balloting purposes during the final days of the election.Indeed, there was such a scandal here about 20 years ago.  Mail-in votes were being tabulated and an IT tech was accused of sharing/selling current tabulation data every evening.  This allowed the opposition to calculate in what districts they had to solicit more votes and ignore the other ‘safe” districts.

                                Dunno. Actions have consequences. Obviously yours. But we also have to make it clear that theirs do, too.
Since lefties don’t have an honest bone in their bodies, I don’t feel obligated to volunteer that Trump’s COVID Cash was inflationary, even if it wasn’t obvious until the Biden Thing was sworn in.
They are still blaming Trump for things he couldn’t possibly have done, like opening the border. Until they at least feign honesty, screw ’em.

                                    Well, that thinking runs parallel to mine–if I understand the essence of your comment correctly.
I have stated before that, until *we* use the voting system to *our* advantage–cheating and all–there will be no incentive to correct the process “holes” by the side that is successfully gaming the system.
That of course is the Left.
Again it’s a matter of naively allowing our virtues to be used against us. None of what I posted was toward recommendation, only observation of the process as it stands today in one State with commentary on obvious short comings.

        On Conservative Treehouse today one of the articles is concerning which personnel Trump must place into positions of power if he is elected.   Good grief.   Even mediocre wits like me can clearly see that “changing personnel” is not going to get the job done.   This attitude is one reason our decline will continue.   To start to fix the problem at least half of the government would have to be eliminated.Also, since at least 2001 this country has committed colossal crimes against humanity.  The government institutions have committed crimes against the citizenry and openly subverted the electoral system.   These are monstrous crimes and the criminals must pay dearly for committing them or there is no fixing what is.   Along with that foreign influence in the government of the U.S. should be a death penalty crime that is ruthlessly enforced.For example how many deaths around the world are the Kagan cult and their followers responsible for?   AT least one million in Ukraine alone.   All of the neocon propagandists should be imprisoned with no parole possibility if not hanged by the neck.Trump is incapable of any action that would make the slightest difference.  However Kamala and the gang will certainly hang people like us if they get the chance.

            Trump is an old-style civnat and a businessman who thinks that business – and making ‘deals’ – can fix everything and somehow restore ‘morning in ‘murka.’  The GOP apparatchiks already have it all worked out, and the first order of business will be . . . wait for it . . . tax cuts!!!  Even with the best of good will, Trump cannot and will not do anything substantive to somehow stop AINO’s disintegration.  He doesn’t hate White people, but neither does he have any actual concern for the future of the Whiterace.  He’s happy to have Jewish grandchildren, and will soon have an Arab/Lebanese one via Tiffany.  He’s a speed bump, not a savior.

                My brother is like what you describe. He will nod along with my observations about race, but deep down, he feels like our current system can work if everybody just starts making more money. His strongest political instinct is that if the Republicans can just goose the economy a bit, then all of my concerns fix themselves.
Trannies, blacks, we can deal with it all, so long as everyone can get a boat. My guess is that many conservatives agree with him.

        It is interesting and sad to think of all the things that our ancestors did to build America. Every time you look at one or some of them, you find yourself asking, ‘What was it all for?’ The answers I keep coming up with are, ‘I and my emerging post-America groups of Americans have to define and be the answer.’The Cold War was a lie it seems. The idea of it was that we had to defeat the Soviets in order to remain free and to preserve our way of life. It turns out that that war was a war on all of Western Civilization and the people who built it. It is worse than having been all for nothing. It was all for something that is the antithesis of who we are. It is so bad, that what it is and grows to become that is bent upon destroying not just all we are, but ourselves period.When you look at the, “Nation of Immigrants”, lie and contemplate what that means you wonder at who can look at even that thing that we are supposed to be and not be terrified. The future is not what you are but always becoming what you are not, there is no future. What post-America is is a perpetual machine of destroying peoplehood, culture, identity, meaning … … Basically it is total annihilation. And, right now, Americans are in its crosshairs. But this machine only offers those who are not in its crosshairs today a chance to put Americans in its crosshairs. Post-America essentially exists to destroy Americans. It makes sense. Post-America needs to destroy the nation-state. The nation makes the state. So, destroy the nation and you destroy the state. The people behind the scope should not get too comfortable. Post-America the annihilation machine has it in for them too. Glee at being the annihilator will someday become the karmic terror of being the annihilated.If the people on this economic zone’s land mass could see that, perhaps they would be sufficiently terrorized to not look back and to look to today to set a course for a less bleak future.If there is one thing of hope, it is that because post-America has us in its crosshairs there is now a lot of movement amongst us to take our survival into our own hands. The curse of being post-America’s sole target for now is, if we continue to build and take constructive action, that we are the first movers who will be able to navigate and survive the annihilation machine.Every day I acknowledge my known and my unknown ancestors and their kith and kin. I know that it won’t have been all for nothing, and that what us first movers are doing will all be for something that will someday be something glorious.When the Cold War was won and PNAC openly advocated for a new Pearl Harbor evil announced itself. For those who want to go back to the 90s, I say why? It would only present a chance to confront and repudiate that evil, but perhaps it still wasn’t possible given that if we went back we would have had to have been decades into preparation to do so and win. We can’t go back. We have to go forward and that always begins with personal responsibility, identifying the in-group and working together to build up the traits and resources in order to be ready for a long a hard fought triumph. In short, a 503 lb loner with potential never forged isn’t going to beat the forces that moved on from The Cold War with a longstanding plan to build the annihilation machine that is post-America.Let’s build our longterm plan and build our post, post-America.Have a great weekend everyone.

            The Cold War was merely a policy disagreement between two materialist and egalitarian philosophies. Both communism and democracy pronounce everyone equal. Both communism and capitalism believe that man is defined by materialism. Both communism and capitalism are global, borderless, atheist ideologies.
The fact that communism and democracy became allies to defeat fascism is a major tell, it betrays the fact that they have more in common with each other than they do with ethnic and cultural nationalism.

                That’s a fine post, and I agree with just about everything in it. My only major disagreement is that untrammeled capitalism produces wide wealth disparities, while communism, in the main, results in equal poverty for all. You are absolutely correct, however, in noting that both regard man ashomoeconomicus.

                    Yeah, but in reality the Soviet nomenklatura and high-ranking Party members enjoyed a similar disparity in wealth. They had chauffeured limousines, private jet travel, offices in the Kremlin, dachas in Crimea.
All supposedly owned by “the workers”… but it’s not as if some average schlub picking turnips on the collective farm ever got to use any of it.

                        Correct. Although the nomenklatura was a considerably smaller sliver of Soviet society than were high-level capitalists in the US/AINO from ca. 1870 to the present.

                        “Soviet nomenklatura and high-ranking Party members enjoyed a similar disparity in wealth.” — Communism may have been bad at producing the goods and services consumers wanted, but it was quite good at limiting disparities in wealth. The sorts of in-kind privileges you cite in no way obviate this fact. Although I cannot speak specifically of the turnip pluckers, Soviet workers’ unions built rather nice resorts on the Black Sea for their members to spend their generous annual vacations at. Some middle class Muscovites even had dachas. Shortages existed due to misguided efforts to  boost living standards by artificially raising salaries; however, people were well fed, had free medical care, etc. Actual income disparity followed the collapse of communism in the 1990s.

                Let’s be clear here. They would have been fine with Fascism in Italy. It was what’s his name in Germany that communism and capitalism had a problem with. Fascism as far as I understand it is just as materialist as communism and capitalism. But what’s his name found a non-materialist issue to inflame the passions of the masses and it spun out of his personal control. The Gods of the Copybook Headings overshadow everything.And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world beginsWhen all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return

                        I was using communism and capitalism in the abstract. But assuming by “they” you mean who I think you mean, sure they did, and they still do. Look at the Middle East right now, they’re coming right out and saying it. But action begets reaction so that unnamed person unleashed a surge of pent-up anger that even he couldn’t control. He had to ride that wave or it would swamp him. Strictly from a historical perspective, that’s what’s always going to happen.

                        Does it merely leave some room for the spiritual or does it place that as its centerpiece? That’s why I said “as far as I understand it”. I admit I’m no scholar on the subject. I bought that book by Paul Gottfried but been too lazy to read it. Without opening the book, isn’t the idea of preserving “the people” its sort of central spiritual purpose? I guess I’m closer to that than anything else but only for existential reasons, existential in the crass sense, not because I feel much tug of emotion anymore in being American and the manipulations by our rulers that that involves.

                    News from across the ocean—Re: FascismThis was an inconceivable concept to even posit to Italians up until fairly recently, but there are elements starting to nibble at the edges again now that enough ‘diversity’ has been dumped on her shores and they see the end game of this in UK, Sweden, and France particularly.Of course, the northern Italians which are analogous to the New England liberals and busy bodies descended from the Puritans, etc. howl about this. Meloni is trying to resurrect the ideas of “the other bad guy, the bald one” when she is simply implying that maybe, just maybe, Italy should stay Italian? And maybe Italians should go about the business of having families and children. The horror! The horror…The “Milan contingent” is really quite scary in its parallels to New England, it would appear that rich liberals, idealism, and being the ‘finance capital’ of a nation brings out the pathological altruism in many peoples. Go poll the wealthier Italians in the northern provinces and hear all the same platitudes you hear in New York, Connecticut, etc.MUCH like NY and CT, these rich Italian liberals experience NO direct diversity. You see, Africans cross the ocean looking for the closest points of land to not drown. Southern Italy. Go poll Southern Italians and get a MUCH different perspective. Funny that… almost like Southerners in the US who know the nature of the African through proximity.Mention this however and you are Bald Fascist Man reincarnated of course. I was randomly handed a flyer for the Brotherhood of Italy walking on the main corso in a small coastal city in the past few months. Incredibly based language inside this flyer, the kind that would get you a front page on the New York Times if a Republican published a political flyer of this nature. Basically saying that under the Meloni government they have halted like 85% of illegal immigration and are proud of this because Italy should stay Italian.So that is your White Pill, some of Europe iswide awakeand the European ship in the South and East is listing to the right HARD which scares the daylights out of the liberal hivemind over here.

                Depends on what you mean by “capitalism”. If Marx’s caricature of it, sure. If it just means “you do with your stuff what you will” it is neither inherently materialist nor atheist. After all, without private property, “Thou shalt not steal” is meaningless, and any deity who decreed such an absurdity is a moron.

                    It’s not entirely a caricature. The capitalist doesn’t give a damn that it’s somebody’s sister or daughter that he’s hiring for his porn film as long as he makes money off it. The capitalist will flood his own country with illiterate brown immigrants if he can hire them for cheaper than native whites. The capitalist doesn’t give a damn if your white five-year old goes homeless after you get evicted when he gives you the layoff notice.The things that the Progressives bitched about a century ago were real — company towns, no regard for worker safety, lowest possible wages, little to no time off, 12+ hour days.And if you objected they would have you shot. Read up about Henry Ford’s goon enforcer Harry Bennett — and Ford was overall a pretty “good guy” relatively speaking:Harry Bennett – Wikipedia

Capitalism says nothing about WHAT you value. You could value money over everything else. You could value family over everything else. You could value self over everything else. You could also value Mother Gaia over everything else.
It’s a goddam lie that I don’t give a rat’s ass about how a society is arranged!

        The churches are in trouble.
The faith is not. People are walking away from their churches, not their faith. A reformation of some sort is on the way. America is doomed without faith, morality and ethics. Without them, the nation collapses, and one will rise in its place that DOES have morals and ethics.

            Faith without structure is, at best, solipsism, and at worst, self-pity. For faith to play a role it must be organized. My sense is what passes for Christianity today is vestigial. It is a ghost in the culture that is slowly going silent. It is why I keep returning to the idea of a new Christianity. Something has to fill the void of organized Christianity.

                Agreed. At least – for the short term.Christianity has been here multiple times in history. The Vatican has gone off its rocker, hucksters sold indulgences and theological favors and fake religious trinkets, regimes declared war on the faith and did their level best to stamp it out. Christianity always survives. The church adapts, new leaders arise, schisms form. The good ones survive, the bad ones die out. The faith will not be defeated by faggots, troons, communists or jews. We are seeing this in Russia as we speak. The Orthodox church is back in force and even Putler respects it.As an aside… it’s interesting. There has been a serious uptick in interest amongst our evangelical types. The kids are looking at the moral and intellectual derelicts of their parents and grandparents and they are seeking alternatives. Or maybe they see the faith as a way to separate themselves from the herd and establish their own identity? Who knows? But… it’s there.When this all comes apart, Z… people will no longer be able to get what they want by being crazy, demented, or thuggish. To survive, families will have to reunite, the lunatics will need to be dealt with, and some kind of order will HAVE to be re-imposed. It will be a good thing, long term. We will have leaders again. We will have real money, communities, order and respect. Violators will be dealt with. We are seeing signs of it already. The return to some kind of normalcy will not be linear – it will be exponential. Perhaps it is a bad example – but You-Know-Who took a starving and beaten nation to super-power status in 5 years. Faced with the opposition we have today…? They are literally DONE the second the American people decide they’re done. They exist because we let them. The truth is that we here on the Dissident Right – or however you wish to define it – are the authors of our own misery. WE let this all happen, WE tolerate it, and WE refuse to do anything about it.Not to be a dink – but I will throw that right back at you.“Faith without structure is, at best, solipsism, and at worst, self-pity.”Is that what we are as Dissidents? Or whatever you decide to call us? We have no structure, no real organization, no places to meet and greet and share fellowship…And maybe that is something we CAN do, going forward. We will HAVE to, at some point.. As you note, any number of hacks, morons and clowns are now trying to hijack the movement and turn it into another failed version of the Alt Right. Maybe we need to step up and establish our own spaces and police them to prevent stuff like this…?It was a great, thought provoking show today Z. You have a great weekend too.Cheers!Filthie

                Christianity is a wrong answer from the past no matter what shape it takes or is given. Most of it comes from a toxic well that needs to be filled in and marked with warning signs for the benefit of subsequent generations.230 yrs ago, Thomas Paine wrote some ideas about religious revolution inThe Age of Reason,Part I(about 50 pages of text). He was excoriated by many, including VP John Adams who called Paine a blackguard for his slicing, dicing blasphemy.TP, a creationist, had no love for the nazi scribbling of Israel, so he deserves to be counted as “anti-Semitic”, which is a good thing to be given the foulness of Semitism. He identifies alleged revelation as mere hearsay. Much of what Bible (older stuff) attributes to God is defamatory. There are interesting remarks about aliens in other star systems, and a (weak) first cause argument is given in ch. 10. He had a high opinion of Jesus, though. So you may be able to get along with him, but seeGeorge H. Smithfor corrections on this topic.

            Was talking about this yesterday with my wife. How a lot of churches just seem to be offering spiritual milk, no real development or assistance for members – but the pastor and his clique gets rich.
However, when you look at the charities active here and around the world (e.g. Samaritan’s Purse), Christians are there on the front lines, putting their faith into practice. I don’t see Muslim or Jewish charities lining up to provide hurricane relief in North Carolina!

                I believe Muslims and Jews reserve the vast majority of their charity for their own kind. Christianity, however, as is its ecumenical wont, is just as likely to prefer non-Christians for charity. And I say that as a Christian.

                But what you say seems precisely against the theme of White solidarity at home.
Your example, Samaritan’s Purse, is my example as well.  It’s a good example of a bad example.  They take their donations from the USA and use those donations in efforts around the world—and they are proud of it and use such external efforts in fund raising here in America.
This aspect of Christian “fellowship” must first be addressed as I can’t rectify it with the DR as we speak about it here.

                        That is a falsehood as money is fungible.  So you tell them your donation is for American relief only, they just send their other funds— that *would* have gone to “American” relief—overseas.
As the Red Cross showed during 9/11, they can’t be trusted. The Red Cross had so much money specifically raised after 9/11, they refused to distribute it all to the 9/11 victims—claiming it was needed for “futures”—and then were caught upgrading their computer infrastructure with *excess* donations.

                My sole problem with the charities doing good work in North Carolina is that  – as usual – I cannot rely on anything I give going solely to local White people.  There’s a church being pushed on YT that’s raising money for Christmas gifts for kids, and I seriously considered donating.  BUT . . . Mestizos have infiltrated North Carolina just like everywhere else, and I’ve read about many cases where official assistance is prioritizing brown people.  I’ll be damned if I’m giving my husband’s hard-earned money to see it used to buy gifts for Jorgeand Maria.

                    3g4me.  That pretty much sums up why I can no longer donate to most any organized charity.  I tried in the past and was always made a fool of.  The last to be let go were those of Christian faith, whereas I now see should have been the first to go.  Wife still likes to donate to a couple of weird organized charities, but that amounts to a few dollars or so.  Not worth getting upset over.  Her purchases of such “indulgences” is cheaper than a lunch out.I still feel bad (guilt?) as my Parochial upbringing was against such “selfishness”.  But is it really selfish to reserve your assets for you and yours?  No, as you’ve noted.

                            Yes, possibly—and I recognize your wry sense of humor in this comment.  However, many of these eco-charities lobby for many ideas that are against common sense and maximum effectiveness.
For example, there are certain charitable organizations that want to stop hunting or farming and leave the earth to “Nature”.  Bad idea.  Then there are other that pay farmers and ranchers to use their land in less environmentally destructive ways—win/win.

                                Compsci:  I like animals and nature as much as anyone, but as you wisely note, most of the eco-charities worship gaia (creation rather than creator) and see people (White people in particular) as the problem.  Plus they have way too many insane women in their ranks and anyone who refers to pets as ‘fur babies’ is not my friend.  It’s better to support local small farmers and ranchers than any national charity.

                                No doubt. However, the wifey donates to very small charities whose scope is very precise. They don’t endeavor to change the world, but rather to help specific animals in need.

                    They don’t have to prioritize non-whites. Non-whites are far more likely to be needy than whites, therefore they will soak up a disproportionate amount of charitable giving. And this is one reason I never “round up for the children” when checking out at the grocery store.

                        My, albeit small answer, is to reward/donate to those I come into direct contact with.  For example, wait staff.  At my supermarket, they hire “bag boys”, some who have mental disabilities.  I never use self checkout and I tip the bag boy—and that’s a hell of a lot cheaper than that person going on welfare!

                    I hear you. I’ve switched to donating blood directly at the hospital rather than the much more convenient Red Cross after they spent all that money importing Central and South Americans, and everyone else they could find in the Darien Gap.
I’m not as adamant about who it gets used on, mostly because there are still no minorities in my AO other than some damn micks 😉  but more that I’m a local, local, local guy. Charity begins at home.

                        I was barred from donating blood for years since I lived in the UK for a year albeit decades ago (mad cow disease panic), and I’ve known for decades that theRed Cross is not to be trusted.  At this point I trust neither civic nor religious charities unless they are solely local (and I mean town/county local, not even statewide).  I don’t want to donate blood for a drug addict or a sexual deviant.  We give to our small, local church and I gave to provide Thanksgiving food to a local family.  That’s the only scale I am comfortable with these days.

                    It’s actually worse than that.  Most charities now are little more than money laundering operations or organizations who specialize in fraud.  It would not surprise me in the slightest to learn some toy charity doesn’t buy from regular wholesalers, but a special “wholesaler” set up for the charity to buy the toys at 25% above retail.  Then, like you said, they find the brown/black kids to give the toys to, preferably on TV.Even charities that do actual work often exacerbate the harms they are meant to fight.  Or they spend the money in some other part of the world where its effects cannot be seen by the donors.Charity starts at home.  To the extent you want to donate to charity, it should only be to small local charities whose “work” is done directly in your community.If you really want to do such a charitable thing like toys for poor kids, go to the store and buy some toys and give them  to a poor family in or near your community with lots of white children.

            I don’t know about everybody else, but I have become more religious ever since I stopped going to church.I have a greater understanding of the Bible and the fundamental conflict between the Old and New Testaments, viz. the fundamental conflict between Judaism and Christianity. Having been totally shafted by arrogant liars and hypocrites myself a few times, I have much greater empathy for what Christ went through when he was framed by the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin. Having seen government SWAT teams murder numerous people such as Randy Weaver’s wife and son over the years, I now understand what it must have been like for Christ to get arrested in the garden by the Roman goons based on the testimony of the paid government informant Judas. Having been to court myself a couple of times, I have greater empathy for what bullshit Pilate’s “trial” was. Having seen how people in positions of power and moral authority are routinely liars, swindlers, hypocrites, and act like assholes, I have greater understanding of Christ’s total rip on the Pharisees in Matthew 23. Having seen what the Jews are doing to the Palestinians, I now understand that the Jewish religion and Jewish holidays like Passover and Purim and Books in the Torah like Samuel and Esther are about murdering their enemies. Having seen politicians and generals with chests full of medals get people killed in fraudulent wars in Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan for personal gain, I now understand what an asshole King David was for getting Uriah killed on the front lines so he could fuck the dead soldier’s hot wife Bathsheba.I never understood any of that by going to church and having some queer in robes tell me when to stand and when to kneel. Church is supposed to point you in a general direction but the true understanding and application of religion is up to you. Church is like studying your multiplication tables in third grade — the purpose of it is to learn how to independently use math later in life. Studying the multiplication tables in and of itself is otherwise meaningless. Institutionalized religion is kind of necessary to indoctrinate women and children, so I do not oppose it necessarily, but if you do not go beyond it you have learned nothing.

                Church is fellowship.  Think of it as a big AA meeting.  However, some folk do not need such and seem to do alright.  I agree with you.  On the other hand, your background probably predicts such independence as does mine.

                As a former devout atheist – I hear you. Most atheists cannot discern between the faith and the church. I was blown away when I met real Christians – the guys that walk the walk AND talk the talk. I have yet to meet an atheist that has studied the bible in depth. They don’t understand even what the bible is. They take it as a means of control and oppression when all it is – is a user’s manual for the human soul. It is the voice of our ancestors, and it laid the foundations for the most affluent and powerful nations and empires in the history of man.To this day I don’t get it. Fascism is blamed for murdering 6 gajillion jews and creating the worst genocide in history. Yet in plain view is the fact that socialism and imperialism killed millions upon millions more. China alone killed at least 20 million of its own people. The Russians killed more jews than Germany did. Nobody know or can even estimate how many arabs the jews have killed – and they are doing their damnedest to get us to kill millions more for them. The lesson here is that ideology cannot replace theology. Christianity effectively protects people from themselves – and although any number of political zealots will tell you their ideologies do the same – inevitably the reverse occurs and they end up killing their own people in industrial sized lots.

        Yup.
Reminds me of Morrison’s ‘This is the End’.  It’s a truthful song — take it from a beautiful friend — but fails to look beyond.
Poor Jimbo saw the future clearly, and just couldn’t handle it, so he cracked open another Jack Daniels and headed to the check-out counter.  Made reservations at the last resort.
The only answer is to work towards something greater than yourself and your moment.  Tends to keep things productive.

You are right Z man; we are at the end of a Spenglerian cycle, and it cannot be reversed. I just want to know if the “end” leads to a Dresden-like end, or a universal Detroit-like end.

            Those who have brought us to the current state of affairs seek only to render their hosts incapable of resisting the takeover of the society for their own purposes. The hosts’ eventual fate is of no concern. They make this quite clear in their pat response to any questioning of their behavior by describing some existential threat faced by their ancestors in centuries past. So, no, they have not thought about what will become of us.

Too many delusional, narcissistic, and psychopathic POS in Government and half the population have pretty much closed the door on that.

        “The answer to the ongoing madness from the people we call the left is some form of “We just have to go back to…” that can never happen, so we continue to swirl in the churn of decline.”There is no answer for the future that doesn’t involve aspects of the past.  Not trying to reincarnate the past, but applying lessons learned looking at the past.  This is not year zero. We cannot close the door to the past even if we wanted to.  We are all prisoners of the past.  Attempts to break free from the past and generate a year zero usually end up with millions of corpses.

        Ironically, it’s the End that should be embraced, rather than lamented. America is too far gone to fix. I’m amazed how many elderly whites are totally disconnected from reality, living in the Progs’ mental prison without questioning it for an instant. The ruin of AINO will be like the forest fire that clears away brush and dead wood.Once it’s really falling apart the outsiders will stop coming, and many may even return home. A breakup might become feasible, followed by internal migration-segregation. The stupid refusal to “see race” will become even more of a death sentence, and the attitude will be selected-out.Sadly, given my age I’ll probably be an early casualty after losing all my savings (if I can’t get it out of the country in time). Still, seeing all those smug Progs brought low, many murdered by their pets, might still be worth it.

            To be fair to the elderly, they lived under that mental prison their whole life, they were subject to the extreme social engineering and propaganda undertaken by the government in the 1950s and 1960s, and, well, they prospered materially in that prison. They’ve never lived in a world where that mental prison didn’t deliver them peace and prosperity, freedom to travel as they see fit, etc. So it’s important to acknowledge that Pax Americana has been very, very good for a lot of people. Rank and file people, regular normies, the type of people it does not help anymore and has not since at least the 08 financial crisis, not just the people who built and maintained the system.

                Mycale:  Yes and no – I’m officially ‘elderly’ (I hate that euphemism – I’m OLD) but that doesn’t mean I have to be stupid.  I changed many of my beliefs in late middle age by being willing to read and learn and consider non-approved opinions and sources.  I prospered – when younger – within the system, but I can still see it wants my White sons dead.  Most people accept a set of beliefs (from parents, peers, etc.) when young and then never change or revisit them when circumstances change.  Growing old does not have to equal dull intransigence.

                    Most people go along to get along. It is what it is. They also, as the COVID plandemic proved, just want to be told what to do. I know Bush got heat back in the day for telling people to “go shopping” after 9/11, but that was totally on brand for Pax Americana and probably the only advice that the regime would ever give.
Very few people are willing and open to changing their entire worldview and coming to understand the nature of the cave they’ve been living in. Including the very successful… heck maybe especially the very successful.

Which is why i’m not worried.  To win, you must be able to overcome your fear of death.  That is the game we are now in.  Based on how half or more of the country reacted to 2020, i’m not worried.  A quarter of them will starve waiting for rescue, another quarter will resort to crime and killing the other quarter of virtue signalers.  That leaves 25% of them that might be capable of resistance.

        The hardest truth. We cannot solve the core problem with words alone. It’s going to get existential, and it cannot be any other way. We have to earn our rebirth via tangible actions. And those actions are going to be unpleasant. Mano-a-mano, the old fashion way. “Today is a good day to die.” The enemy is few and protected by a mirage. They are not real men. They will buckle and flee with the first shot. No quarter, no mercy. It must be done.

            I like the spirit of this comment and hope it is accurate.  That said, I’ve read quite a few accounts of the nitty gritty details of the Spanish Civil War, Russian Revolution, Finnish Red Terror, etc., and it seems the effete Leftist trash at the top always manage to dig up a large number of rough and ready mass murderers at the street level everywhere they set up shop.  Indeed, the stories amaze in terms of how many amoral killers are always enlisted to commit the unspeakable.I think we would do well to avoid letting ourselves be surprised by the ruthlessness of those people.  Or by the cowardice of most ‘normies’ who won’t lift a finger in self-defense but will go meekly to the wall.

                Indeed. They always find jackboots somewhere to fill the ranks of their thugacracy. This mostly occurs via mercenary hires and will likely include many illegals promised citizenship in exchange for their brutality. And there will also be patriotic militia types to confront them. All of that will become the fog of war and chaos. Against that background, our duty is to become the bolt-from-the-blue focused at the root of the problem. And it won’t take many successes to ignite the parasite exodus stampede.

        Zman is correct. The wages of Christ are cuckdom. One might argue it was not always so, and that “real Christianity” just like “real Communism” has not been tried, or whatever, but the fact remains that Christianity is now inseparable from cuckdom and in fact demands it. As it pains me to say.Thus for White people it will fade away. There have been beliefs trying to fill this hole: Wiccanism, neo-Paganism but they appeal respectively to a few Lesbian Wine Witches and various gay dudes. Not much there to find meaning and comfort and a moral way of living that provides security and fellowship for most ordinary White people. What will fill the hole of departing Christianity (all churches will be Rainbow and Diverse) has yet to be seen.[Interestingly Tyler Perry and the Madea films address this for black people. For black people, Christianity does NOT imply cuckdom, for obvious reasons. I suspect it will be only black and perhaps hispanic people who remain Christians in the GAE.]As for America, it is an extended stay hotel with a global guest list, nothing more. My guess is someone will pick up the big hole in GAE with some sort of loyalism network of White people dedicated to helping White people navigate a geographical location where their government hates them, a significant portion of Social Darwinist White elites hates them, NGOs hate them, universities hate them, non-Whites hate them, and so on. And that the tie that binds will be as much about as counter-hate as anything else.Hate as a motivating force is stronger than love. Where love fades, hate can last forever. Hate perfectly encapsulates the downward mobility and oppression all Whites will have, forever, outside of a privileged few. As the man sang, “Anger is an energy.”

            The Springfield Haitians story gave us a surprise clue that finally, after decades of the TV pretending it’s out there menacing everybody already,white ragehas become truly expected.In the news clip of the local Job Creator (PBUH) telling us why he’s replaced all his white workers with afro-retards who can’t plausibly doanythingprofitably, he recites a litany of reasons why white people suck and shouldn’t be employed by anyone, mostly the usual stuff you hear from Republicans, they’re lazyandon meth, etc. Mostly.Now, this dude is nowhere near smart enough to observe anything or think of anything for himself, but he included aninnovationin the litany. Official word among people who tell Job Creators what to say about white people must have recently expanded to include: They’retoo emotional.As in, we havesome reactionto the injustices we individually and collectively face. When we get screwed, we’re like, “Hey man, not fair.” Other races don’t behave this way. (True.)Readers of J.D. Vance &amp; Associates might recall that he pioneered—was tasked to pioneer, to “meme into existence”—this particular angle of anti-whiteness.Listeners to some /ourguy/ podcasts may have nooooticed them telling their listeners who refuse to embraceVance et al. to “cry more.”Elections are fake, but campaign themes are real.

        Another thing we did was give every bad idea we were sold a fair hearing.I mean we tried, we really tried, gave ’em their shot.We were told we could be gooder, or better, or less bad, or a new people, if only we tried it their way.Turns out their ideas of us- and of themselves- were only based on a caricature.Every claim made was a false promise by someone who wanted to be more than we are. Every depiction of our sins was also a fevered imagination.So now, we know whatnotto do.Don’t listen to idiots.

        I have never heard“the ongoing madness from the people we call the left is some form of “We just have to go back to…”Leftists never say they want to “go back” to anything.  It would reveal their failures en masse. It’s like asking leftist tree huggers how many of their predictions came true.  Now conservatives do pine for the past in some things: religion, education, Pax Americana and such. Never leftists.

“We have to go back” doesn’t work if you’re afraid of being called every name in the book, which the conservacucks are. You can’t go back to Reagan era if you’re not willing to go back to a time when homosexuals were in the closet, and of course the conservacucks are fully on board LGBT these days.

        Speaking of a confluence of events and the end of things, the programmers in the room may enjoy this.I was introduced to Wolfram’s Theory of Everything the other day, and in articulating why his theory does not work, I almost explained how we got to this present End of Things from a logical standpoint. Z-Man’s podcast brought forward the rest.A central claim of the Enlightenment and Classical Liberalism is that we can organize societies purely through logic. This is the same thing as saying “identity does not matter”, because all logic systems are closed systems with no external references. The “is” not existing in logic systems is a correlation to identity not existing within them either. A society built from logic first is radically egalitarian from first principles, and any people bound to that society will eventually express this aspect of its first principle as we have seen in the West.The problem with this and Wolfram’s theory is that logic is non-operative until an identity is set. A = A + 1 does not do anything until the identity of A is determined. In programming, this is called a null reference exception which crashes out your program. Western Civilization is crashing out from a null reference exception, and there is no logical argument against that.Except that in the real world, people inherently supply their individual identity into the system of society, which is why society has not frozen in place. Instead of null, the system is basing itself on the infinity symbol, which overloads the logic of the system into effectively meaningless gestures. Hence Anarcho-Tyranny into Hobbesian all against all.The pragmatic application of pure logic says that any society that tries to begin with pure logic apart from a particular identity is radically egalitarian and so will become radically egalitarian before it dies in chaos as the rule and logic set becomes overwhelmed by the infinite. If someone tries to argue for a rule set based on infinity, you ask them what a 6-month-old, fascist, Russian-Iranian president looks like.

        While it is true that most government entities (federal, state, and local) are inept and can’t do their jobs, Florida has been an exception — at least for now. I live on the west coast of Florida. Both Helene and Milton affected our area: Helene mostly by flooding (storm surge) and Milton both flooding (heavy rains and surge) and strong winds.Our county government has been surprisingly competent, including working with the power company to restore power. Over half of the residents lost power but almost everyone was restored within days. A huge amount of debris was produced in both storms: waterlogged household items from flooding and tree branches from winds. The scale is hard to comprehend. County workers quickly removed debris from roads and streets to make them passable. The monumental task of collecting debris from residences and businesses is continuing. I have seen the huge piles already at makeshift dumps — presumably only temporary holding sites until the junk can be moved to a permanent location. The county has a website that shows where the pickups have occurred and are planned.Life is mostly back to normal here. Many county parks are still closed as uprooted trees and fallen branches are being cleared off. My neighbors have been helping each other recover from the damage. I moved to Florida in 2022. When I described the atmosphere here to a friend in California he remarked that it sounded like America of the 1950s.No, we can’t go back. But there are still pockets of functioning society. And, yes, it’s about 90% white here.

                Yep, AZ here did a good one to me last year.  They set up “on line” appointments.  I got one, arrived, and was told to stand in a line–of those having appointments.  There was two lines, appointments and non-appointments–both equally long.
In my appointment line, there was no calling out as to who was scheduled when, just a drone yelling “next”.  When I spoke to others in line it was apparent that we were a mixture of those with earlier appointments and later appointments.  Not any different than the second line and both lines were served equally–poorly.

            I supported DeSantis initially because of his record of competence in Florida and also the “Trumpism without Trump” thing. DS turned out to be disappointing and also could not figure out a way to separate the Trumper Republicans from Trump (whom I regard as completely untrustworthy). What should have been a runaway for Republicans after the last four years and the pathetic Dem candidate is a horse race because of the negatives associated with Trump. The frustrating part is that the whole TDS thing is absurd, since Trump has shown himself to be a part of the system and not a threat to it.

        The past we remember as children is the only thing we can’t go back to. The nostalgic past. That’s merely a remembrance of trite silly things. We must and will go back to the past for the enduring ideas that will shape our future.

            I don’t consider the childhood I enjoyed in the 70s and early 80s to be silly at all. Quite the opposite. Its small delights and emolliuments were what made life grand. As for the present, it is far beyond silly. It is preposterous to a risible level. And I ache that little white boys and girls, far from experiencing the joys that I did, are instead being subject to the ministrations of anti-white enforcers of an increasingly hideous reality.

                The 70s and 80s were especially trite and silly. The 50s and 60s when I grew up we had the assassinations, the threat of nuclear war, and the Vietnam war. But the 50s and 60s had a lot of triteness and silliness too.

                    After Reagan got elected, the 80s really did feel like, “Morning in America.”
It did not hurt that popular movies and music, consciously or unconsciously, largely fed into this zeitgeist.
Another factor that helped was the simultaneous emergence and convergence of multiple technologies that positively impacted most aspects of society.
I was a young child that lived in Main Street, USA in those days. It still felt like living in the future.

                    Why “trite” and “silly?” What do those words mean to a 12-year-old boy, who can spend his summers from morning until dusk with his male friends, riding their bicycles here and there, playing sports, building forts and backyard pools, playing Strat-o-Matic Baseball, no phones, no computers, no electronics except for record players on which they’d play their older brother’s rock albums and 45s on rainy July days? Not a parent in sight, not a girl or woman in sight, not a single person to hector them or lecture them or try to mess with their minds, or call their activities trite and silly, as if they should be doing something more serious with their time, like declaring their gender identity or apologizing for their whiteness?That’s an adult looking back and being miserable about something wonderful. Did you not live through it? Sounds like you missed it.

                        No I didn’t miss out on it. I’m glad I had the luxury of a trite and silly childhood. But the tone and temper of it was worlds apart from today. In other words, there were actual lessons towards adulthood in the follies of adolescence, unlike today where you’re never expected to grow up. Trite and silly is a good thing as long as it doesn’t become an enforced sanitized reenactment of what kids should be doing in Mommy’s mind.

                            Expanding on the idea of lessons, remember kids’ shows and cartoons in the ’80s?
Yes, many of them were ads for toys. However, there were many episodes of those shows that did have moral arcs in their plots.
There were even shows like G.I. Joe that had separate public service announcement segments which attempted to teach a moral lesson to the kids watching.
Now it seems as though all popular media is just a stealth delivery mechanism for communist nihilism and degeneracy.

        Europeans would talk about how America was the envy of the world for our freedom and love of individuality.
It’s like waking up in a nightmare; I only remember Reagan as a child and young adult and everything was so optimistic. But looking back, everything was in place for our destruction, and why should Reagan care he was an old man and lived his life. This little talk he gives here is ultimate despair  disguised as optimism:

            One interesting symbolic note: Reagan’s last public address was at the 1992 GOP Convention in Houston. He was the headline speaker for the evening. Future Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson introduced him — but she had to introduce Pat Buchanan first, who preceded Reagan at the podium: “Tonight we hear from two Great Communicators.”Buchanan’s speech pushed Reagan past 11 pm on the East Coast, and the network commentators went bananas after Pat’s speech and barely mentioned Reagan in the lead-in.It was nostalgia for Reagan that kept Buchanan from succeeding (and a lot more, of course); people didn’t want to hear it then, they wanted Ronnie and a Coke and an American flag.

        One of the encouraging things about our movement is that some have consciously set themselves up as a funnel. So, some who you may think are not on our side are; they are just playing it smart and not charging with a sabre alone into a fifty deep army of redcoats.
That said, Rufo, is clearly a leftist. He is a leftist whose victories are pyrrhic and whose fight is performative.

        Thanks for the laugh, in these times I need them wherever I can get them.The idea that Americans are constantly working to make things better while European slobs are idle was the best joke I’ve seen in a while. It certainly explains why all the discerning people are abandoning their Porsche’s BMW,s Mercedes’, Bentley’s, Aston Martins, Ferrari’s etc for Cadillac’s and Corvettes just as soon as they can afford them. How they live with only two holders per car is a mystery. Similarly German machine tools: The Machines that make machines stopped owning the US market due to the leap’s and bounds in accuracy and tight tolerances of American companies and has nothing to do with some Gilligan’s Island crew blowing up North Stream. How the Swiss get by telling the time by those sun dials they wear on their wrists is another mystery. As for Microchips look at ASML, a Dutch company, and if you go to Europe, take a tip from me: fly Airbus not Boeing.
