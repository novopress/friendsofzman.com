        all of the things we consider to be private were public for most of human existence
Not quite. Apes shy from other apes for some activities; sly breeding for one. Apes find food, hide and hoard it. Many mammals breed, give birth or raise children away from their herd or pack as matter of safety (from other members of the herd or pack).
Privacy may have grown with capability. As predators learned to fear people, it became possible to be alone without the fear of death. Prior to that, safety required numbers.

            My default when looking at these things is to assume a dynamic. Hunter gatherers in Eurasia maintained some minimal privacy for things like sex and courtship. The sense of dignity, however, was minimum as it could not be a trait of much use and possibly even detrimental. The desire to have some separation and independence from the group was there and was part of the set of traits that led to settlement. That in turn made traits for self-sufficiency, independence, privacy, etc. more valuable, elevating their status.My observation is that the further you go north the more common the sense of privacy. Perhaps the need for males to be away from the group for long periods to get food is the cause.

        Privacy was always possible. If you were that desperate you left the herd and tried to make it on your own. Hermits were just about guaranteed total privacy. Of course it was lonely but if you could pretend a god (or gods) approved of it then you could get by. As for sex, I think people have found ways of pleasuring themselves without anyone else since people developed the ability to grasp and, er, wiggle.trouble is these days privacy would be immaterial if it wasn’t commercial. if Googoo can examine your life it isn’t because they are particularly interested in your activities or proclivities, it is because someone will pay for that knowledge.Years and years ago I had a relative who worked for a major publisher in London. He told me back then he would be offered dozens of lists of names and addresses each year for marketing purposes. This was years before tinterwebz and emails, so how these people acquired them I knew not, and anyway I lived in the sticks so who would want my name and address? Since then i have discovered I am a commodity. Today I went to a toy shop to buy a present. Would I like to win some money by registering online at sellyourprivacy.argggh or some such place? Were I foolish enough to try to win a few quid my name and address and the fact I like buying dolls would be circulated for all to see.Without the money aspect no one would care at all that i like dolls with flouncy petticoats.

        I think that you have two options:
• Live an entirely exemplary life  The problem with this strategy is that any transgression, no matter how minor, be held up as the vilest hypocrisy known to man by your rivals and enemies.  So you might as well just…
• Let it all hang out.  It’s not just the Virgin Mary who will cry every time you masturbate, it’ll be your mom since she’llknow.  So if you scratch your butt and pick your nose you might as well do it in public.

        You have to wonder, with the numbers bandied about on page views, and traffic stats, how many of the ‘visitors’ are ghosts, or try outs sent in before the ‘real’ guest stops by. And then there’s the bot factor.We live in the age of the simulated entourage.
