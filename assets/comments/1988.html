        I dropped my daughter off at high school  on a morning in which there were many teachers outside carrying signs for passage of a bill here in Las Vegas to provide more tax money for “education”. One made the mistake of coming over to my car. I told her I had a simple plan to double the wages of teachers without raising taxes. She was enthusiastic. Then I told her I hoped she would understand that when wages were doubled the type of individuals who would work for peanuts would be replaced by the type of people who would not.

        One wonders if said student would want to work with people like them, or would hire people like them.

        I once did a spell of teaching, and the first thing I have to say is that in my sector (a college not expecting very bright students) there was no illusion about the ‘value’ of teachers. We knew we were on a front-line and could expect no support from the those higher up. A colleague of mine was sexually assaulted but the offender, who was pulled off by some disgusted class-mates, was not ejected from the college. Rather, she was told that she should make her lessons ‘more interesting.’That was the problem: those higher up ‘knew’ all about teaching but never did it themselves. They were free to make criticisms on theory (a relative of mine who teaches still was told by a senior administrator that he wasn’t ‘developing discussions enough’ in his science lessons.  The theorist believed that teaching science should be out opinions and not facts) but would not take control of a class. That was not their job, they would insist.The college I taught at made noises about discipline but wouldn’t enforce it. No cell phones they said in class but if you tried to stop a person from using their phone in the middle of a lesson there was no support. You just had to accept that you were on your own and made the best you could of it. Incidentally. I was told, in a review by a younger fellow teacher, that I gave the impression of knowing more than the students. Actually, her words were I ‘appeared to be superior.’The college meanwhile needed the money to keep going so banning students was never an option. A colleague of mine who was hit in the face by a student was suspended as was the student. It was done for ‘fairness’ even though he was the once with the bloody nose.The problem with education is that the theory often sounds good but the reality is quite different. The idea of motivating students was impossible if they were there only for the social contacts. The students in fact never studied as such and merely copied and pasted answers from web sites. We teachers knew it was hopeless but the pressure was on to get these youths through the system so their retention figures looked good.I have to be honest and say some of the youngsters were great people but the majority were out of their depth, and the demand on their time was hardly onerous. They believed they would walk into very well paid jobs the moment they left college irrespective of what they did there, but interestingly none of the students I had ever wanted to teach.Their reaction to that career option was one of horror. “I wouldn’t want to teach people like us,” one of them told me.
