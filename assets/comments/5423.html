        Hmmm…I just replaced my 10 yr old coffee maker because it took up too much room on my kitchen counter and I got tired of it.  It worked just fine and I used it EVERY DAY for 10 years! It would probably have worked for another ten. As noted above, these voting machines are rolled out, what, 2 or 3 times every other year, at most! The left is completely delusional on their very best days.

        The Left can’t conceive of a world where everyday people don’t want to vote for them, so of course the voting machines are old and broken, or some voters are being “disenfranchised”, or the moon is full, or its raining, or the day of the vote ends in the letter y. Anything, anything but people rejecting them and their rancid socialist ideas.

        So it won’t be the “robot apocalypse” after all but the “voting machine apocalypse”. No Skynet but plenty of Hanging Chad. Seriously though, maybe we could bring back the old Greek notion of Ostracism. Vote to throw some of these people out of the country for a decade.

        If these machines are in fact going bad, it means the voting machine industry is screwing over public officialdom with lousy products. These things are only rolled out a few times a year, and then worked for only one day. Public officials have weeks or months to check them out and make sure they’re in good working order. Compare that to electronic machines in commerce and industry which are often run 24/7, and maintained on the fly. A 15-year old voting machine has probably gotten as much use as a private-sector machine gets in a couple of weeks.
