        Just imagine if prenatal diagnosis or fertilized egg DNA testing before implantation could predict future sexual orientation? That’s why i believe we are currently living thru the peak homo era, with the maximum number and cultural influence of said “home team players”.
In a few decades it will probably be illegal to do such screening in NY &amp; LA. It will be threated like now abortion is in conservatives areas of the US. I don’t think liberals will be so abortion crazy if you throw that factor into the mix, never mind the hypocrisy.

        In case some reader recalls more than me, there was a news article years ago that DNA was not so good when you included millions across the land rather than some few. It was regarding DNA matches to catch criminals and said it was very good in matching among some few possible culprits but matching against a national DNA data base would yield false matches.
So, if true there is some chance that finding “dad” may not result in finding your own.

            DNA testing that we see for criminal work is mathematically problematic. The reason is math. The samples used by the FBI, for example, are “profiles.” The test kits used in the United States generally examine the 13 STR loci selected by the FBI for CODIS, the national DNA database. At each STR locus, there are a number of different alleles (generally between 6 and 18) that a person might have.  Each person inherits two of these alleles, one from each parent.  Numbers are used to identify the alleles and the pair of alleles at a particular locus constitutes a genotype. Hence, one person can have a genotype (for a locus called D3S1358) of “14, 15;” while another person has the genotype “16, 17.”   The complete set of alleles detected at all loci for a given sample is called a DNA profile.To be brief, they are not doing a complete DNA comparison. They have selected a number of places to compare that have the greatest variability. Think of it this way. Let’s say all humans are issued an ID at birth. That 32-character number is unique and never reused. But, the first four characters are ABCD for everyone. When comparing two ID numbers, there would be no point in comparing the first four characters, since they are the same for all people. That’s true of DNA. To keep costs down, they selected the bits for comparison with high variability that re the best understood.The problem is the math and partial profiles. Not all samples are complete. From a crime scene, they may get enough usable material for a partial profile. That gets loaded into the database with the other samples. The chance for coincidental matching of complete profiles is 1 in one trillion. Add in partial profiles and the chances for a coincidental match drop quickly. A partial profile from crime scene could have a 1-in-10 million chance of a match in the total population, but when loaded into a database of tens of millions the chances for a coincidental match are greater than zero, which is a problem.My assumption is that these genealogical companies are going further than what the FBI is doing. When trying to find a family member, other evidence would be useful. Age, location, blood type, etc.

        Dang, Zman, read your predictions. Tocquevillian. Does the 800 number come out after you are done stomping the Hippies?

        I will be spending the final day of the year as I always do, out in the streets stomping hippies.

        I’m not a big believer in determinism. Yes, your genetic make-up will determine much about you that cannot be changed, but it won’t tell you how far you can go in life. Free will, motivation, and yes, hard work, will have a big hand in your choices and how they are expressed to improve your lot in life. Believing in a “caste system” of the kind you describe (alphas, betas, etc.) stultifies a culture. And flies in the face of over 200 years of American history. It is a big part of the success of America, the belief that your background need not limit your opportunities, that nearly everything is possible if you have a great idea and enough “gumption”.While the American Dream doesn’t seem as easy or possible as it once did, for a whole host of reasons, it’s still there. I don’t think advances in our understanding of genetics is going to change that, but those advances combined with advances in the fields of nanotechnology and chemistry are probably going to be responsible for humanity’s Next Leap Forward, IMO.
