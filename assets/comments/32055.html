        What’s amazing is while the top elites have become more and more insulated from general society, the insulation is reaching lower and lower layers to the point where your basic middle manager who went to a state school now looks at working class people like they’re aliens. It’s not even that they have very different mindsets, but they can’t even process that other people have motivations outside of your basic corporate striverism.A society could always deal with a few ignoramuses on op as long as you had practical people close-by to nudge them in the right direction, but now you need to go through six or seven layers of clueless paper-pushers before you can figure out what’s actually going on.

            Yes, the amount of money necessary to avoid the “Thunderdome” is increasing at a rapid pace.  A generation ago you would avoid it with top 50% income; a decade ago you could avoid it with top 10% income; now you need top 1-2% income to avoid it.  It will continue to get worse as the world descends into the hell of neoliberal feudalism.  This4chan commentfrom 2013 described the situation accurately.

                That’s for sure.  I remember when being a millionaire was a dream for the common person.  It was the “I’ve made it” moment.  Hell they even made a successful TV show called, “The Millionaire” about such an achievement.  Now I talk to people of that ilk—top 10%, several million in assets—and they are resting *uneasy*.  It’s back to the past with the Nobility vs the Peasants.

                    I remember in the late ’80s early ’90s when Forbes had their wealthiest families issue, and said that if you wanted to be among the really wealthy, you had to shoot for $10 mil. Those days are gone forever. I should just let them go…

            Yes. I am not convinced that the issue is entirely IQ. I think it is corruption and ignorance.  When you don’t study the arts and letters and then go through significant trials and tests to prove you are an elite there is no selection mechanism and the ones who pass through (through nepotism and signaling your (im)moral propers), have not been formed. They are highly formed in the moral signaling mechanisms, but unformed on the cognitive civilizational forms.Go to Wikipedia and look at the bio of every single one of these fools. They all get the same degrees from all the same places. They are all working toward the same destructive ends incentivized by all the wrong things.To your point about ever lower rungs, well this is symptomatic of the same thing. I doubt there is an elite education at all today. This goes on the lower rungs who do the same study of the simpleton moral propers and away they go.When you degrade education and preparation and formation, (culture comes from the root to culture or to cultivate), so that its aim is repetition of information to get high test scores and limit the goals of this education to getting a credential then you have destroyed the system.Everywhere you go are people with no moral compass who are guided by a morality compass where the morality is a 180 inversion of the good, the true and the beautiful.What I wouldn’t give to see Jamie Raskin get a series of finger wags, neck rolls and ultimately hood slaps in the August chambers of the US Congress. For degrading and subverting these once great halls once filled by statesmen and good men he deserves at least that. I am holding out hope I will live to see it.

                Remember what some of the most legendary football coaches have said in the past:STATISTICS ARE FOR LOSERS. IQ is like athletic ability. If you don’t train it and use it, you don’t maximize it and then it atrophies. We’re not putting enough people through the rigor necessary to maximize hone their God-given intelligence. In fact, when I was growing up in my middle-class suburban school, it was discouraged. That’s why “IQ” is falling.

            “working class people like they’re aliens”In many respects they are aliens. Just look at the lifestyles they lead these days. (See: Charles Murray’s Belmont and Fishtown.) When I was growing up, there were a lot of normal people. Nowadays it seems like you are marrying into a lot of social dysfunction of you have too much to do with that crowd.Mind you, my dad was a union carpenter and he didn’t want us to have those social circles. Not because he looked down on those people (well, maybe a little), but because he didn’t want us to have the lifestyles of the people he worked with. And that was even 50 years ago!

        I cannot understand why a simple ‘Thank you’ isn’t enough to tell AIPAC or other donors. This over the top Israel _ss-kissing is really disgusting. Netanyahu addressed the U.S. Congress once and it looked like an early 60’s Beatles concert, with U.S. Congresspeople screaming, crying and throwing their panties at him.
This gross behavior of showing who can kiss Israeli _ss more reminds me of prostitutes getting into a catfight over who their pimp favors the most.

        The decline of the elite – especially the Jewish elite – is one of the reasons why the old guard won’t let go. There’s just not much behind them, and they know it.There’s definitely an interregnum feel to our time. We can’t go back for a variety of reasons, but no one wants to move forward either, mainly because the people fear what the future will look like and/or who will run it. The Jews are obviously losing some of their grip. The Indians are on the march. Whites are demoralized but waking up to some degree. Hispanic will just drift with the tide but lack skills to maintain a 1st World country.When you combine those demographic forces with falling competence of the elite, you can see why no one is excited about what’s coming.

            I saw a video of Jane Fonda urging ‘pussy boycotts’ to spur action on climate change, remembered Republican (including Trump) flip-flopping on abortion, and it reinforced this vague notion I have that the relative asexuality of young people could have a big silver lining. Demographic forces indeed!
I think there will be a huge mess to clean up, which is nothing to look forward to, but I don’t think the future is to be dreaded. Like a lot of the covid fear, I imagine it’s more about paying the piper, or an inflated sense of self.

                Isn’t Jane Fonda like 147 years old by now? Who cares about her p-ssy it is already boycotted for being a commie lefty dusty old hag.Likewise, it shows how totally out of step Boomer (and older) women are with the zeitgeist. Young men would barely feel a “pussy boycott” because the vast majority are not getting it anyways. 2/3rds of them are sexless because the feral nature of women has been completely unleashed and unrestrained now.We are back to the “warlord / harem culture” that all societies will revert back to without social controls. Chad, Tyrone, and the stupidly wealthy collect up harems and the women are being shared in this small pool of alpha males.Yet another lynchpin of civilization removed with a little (((help))) from our friends with the sexual revolution and feminism. Stable male/female relationships were always high on the target list and they have largely succeeded at this point is destroying them.

                    Jane Fonda was like 94 last I saw her. She is fairly sharp and not addled of the mind. Leftist as ever in her views. Her plastic surgery of the face is a bit offsetting given her age, but not as extreme as most all others we see. She is thin and of good proportion. Her exercise lifetime routine has paid off.She is a good example of the reason we need a just God and a heaven and a hell. She will pass on to that anti-aircraft gun in the sky having never received her “just deserts” in this life.

Oh, how original. Gee, it’s not as if the white man Aristophanes didn’t come up with that idea as a comic spoof 2,500 years ago..

                I hate to point out the obvious: Fonda was right.The 93% of the years of its existence that the US has been at war has resulted in a $34 trillion national debt and an economy that makes over-priced, over-complicated, under-performing weapons systems and a third world infrastructure.

            My 18-year old nephew came over to spend a few minutes with me last night. He went to one of the local fancy private schools. We were talking about this stuff and I was teaching him the meaning of the word “Schadenfreude” and how it applies to the small hats since they were leading the charge for white replacement.But then I gave them credit for pushing their kids to study. He said, nah. The ones he went to school with are just as big of a bunch of “losers” (relatively speaking) as the white kids. Gone are the intellectually curious Jews with the unique and sometimes brilliant insights, I guess.

            The decline of the elite – especially the Jewish elite – is one of the reasons why the old guard won’t let go. There’s just not much behind them, and they know it.
There are plenty of competent folks at any randomly selected cow college’s STEM departments or STEM industry company who are just as smart and capable as those currently pulling the levers of power.  But these are folks who know htings and can get things done.

        The colonial powers in Africa lost the will to fight more than they were overthrown. So lacking the will to fight, they concocted a new colonialism built on debt. This correlates with our own present day managerial class, which is deathly afraid of being seen getting dirty, but hopes and plans for new financial control mechanisms (CBDC) to make their tyranny look clean.

Our people who are adventurous or greedy venture out and then, due to our pathological compassion,we become entangled with the non-whites we encounter.

                    True of subsaharan Africa but not north Africa west of Egypt. It had been lost to adherents of a less ovine sect of Abrahamism. That territory could have been recovered but in a prudent way, not in the Cuckian-liberal way of, say, the French* in Algeria. The sands and their subsaharan slaves ought to have been driven south into the desert or across the Red Sea into Arabia. Most of the sands, beingthieves like most Jews, could have been compelled to leave behind one hand and one foot each as relics to commemorate their defeat and eviction. As we are seeing again, now in Gaza, the Jews would not have been nearly so sissyish as their Eurogolems....* The French deserved to be driven out of southeast Asia, though. Once again, the usual cultural prejudices made it uncomfortable to let those nations to be independent of Zion and humanism. The French will be wiped out in France, probably, because they refuse to shake off the disease(s), condemn their ancestors’ foolishness appropriately, and cultivate theirselves in a much better direction. The boys of France could learn a lesson or two from the Vietnamese about how to be men.

                    The problem with Africa wasn’t going there; it was that the earliest exploitation of the continent focus on acquiring slaves when the real value was the abundance of natural resources like gold and oil. Eventually, European guilt over the slave trade and the growing cost of dealing with intractable Africans meant that European colonization would end. The South African whites, with their apartheid policies, held out longer than most others; but they too bowed to international pressure and surrendered their sovereignty. It’s ironic that their Dutch forebears were able to purchase Manhattan island from the American natives for the equivalent of $24. The Dutch have a long history of prosperous trading, knowing when to allocate capital and manpower and when to cut and run.After sixty years of decolonization, Africa clings to a precarious, dystopian survival only by continuing to rely on white civilization’s expertise and charity. You’d think they’d realize that the gibs don’t just magically appear and maintain themselves in perpetuity, but the black race has always been incurious and shortsighted.

                It was the egalitarian ratchet effectOr: It was theSaulianityratchet effect. The point of this name, of course, is to stigmatize “Western” egalitarianism at its probable source while drawing our attention to a plausible interpretation of Christianity, viz, it’s a Heeb hustle to subvert enemies of Zion. Originally this was Hellenes and Romans, but now it’s all nations not called Israel.“Paul” was not the given name of the apostle of the heart set free, asF.F. Brucecalled him in the US title of one of his crazy books. It’s derived from a nomen or cognomen. (In the name Gaius Iulius Caesar, Iulius and Caesar are nomen and cognomen, respectively.) So calling him Paul, while sometimes necessary, is like carrying water for the consummate subversive Israelist. It obscures his identity, diverts attention from motive, and panders to the gullible who have fallen for the risible conversion story about Saul.The genocidal war against all of us is basically Israel’s war against us, which is just what many Christians believe already. They need blunt reminders, however, that they are on Israel’s side in the war, just as the USA’s slow liberals—conservatives—are on the side of the Democrats. So, for example,Andrew Torba, Gabmaster, is on the side of the rabbis and elders of Zion and will have to be confronted with this horrible fact.

            The colonial powers in Africa lost the will to fight more than they were overthrown.
It wasn’t so much the lack of a will to fight; it was the realization that their empires were money losing operations. So, they liberated their colonies, thereby stopping losses and looking virtuous at the same time.

            The erudite and wise liberals of Pennsylvania sent a braindead hobo to Congress, one who literally cannot understand the spoken word. I’ll never forget it and it, to me, marks the clearest example of election-as-humiliation-ritual that we have yet seen.

                The Pennsylvanians at least had the sense to reject a Turkish con artist who had nothing to say except “pick me, pick me”, who was endorsed by Trump, thereby revealing his one weakness (and it’s a big one) – the shameless desire to be admired by people with money.

        Israel’s neighbors will not allow the Palestinians to flee by land. The newly-constructed dock, and the ones to come, were conceived so the Palestinians can board the ships that will arrive to move them west into societies conditioned to accept foreigners. Supply while the Palestinians are deported is mere pretext and why they are being starved to incentivize them with food.

            Yes, the IDF is using rolling thunder to drive the remaining Palestinians toward the ports. First they drop leaflets in designated areas announcing a bombing campaign on a particular block. When they evacuate that sector, every building is leveled making it uninhabitable. Repeat block by block until all are driven to the ports and evacuated. It’s systematic and relentless. Once the Israelis have forced this exportation overseas, they become someone else’s problem (hello USA and EU). Our government is committing actual treason and getting away with it. Real hatred is building like a pressure cooker.

                Don’t panic, Tom, about where the Pali trash will live. Your big idea for dissidents is to flee the coasts and cities for the rural interior. Such movement makes room for the replacements and relieves the pressure that worries you. The regime would waste a lot of time looking for a more helpful dissident.

                    Drive-By, I’d like to address you directly re a comment yesterday.(I’m your one upvote, as I understand all too well your wrath.)Yes, Christianity is an imperfect vehicle, the camel’s dangerous Big Nose under the tent.But you do a great disservice to your people.You forget that ANY Aryan vehicle will be targeted, to be turned to serve the broken branch that strives to replace us.But! Our people take back what was stolen and corrupted, to serve another’s evil ends…And we, retaking it, strive to turn it back again to serve the good.This is our strength.  This is our beauty.  This is our function.Even a corrupted tool can still yet serve the highest goal.That is, after all, what Whites are for.Christian forms are a dialect, spoken by those who can avail themselves of it.  Those like you, me, or Steve serve in a different division, we speak in a different language.I wouldst build a bridge across, rather than throw away such a powerful and widely used and useful tool.We must retake what was ours, and learn to translate.

            Agreed, and there unfortunately are more than a few people who actually support the current corrupt, venal and stupid US government regardless – oh and get frothy on their lips if the topic of Trump happens to come up.  We’re on a long slide down and nothing is going to stop it – however, acceleration of some sort is always a possibility.  It’s all ultimately going to have to be rebuilt from scratch anyway…

            I agree. That’s why I use the term ‘Factory Farm USA’ — Americans have been bred over the last few generations for docility. Just as the pigs, cows, and sheep don’t rebel on a farm (though a few may dimly sense their fate is going to be a tragic one), the denizens of Factory Farm USA don’t rebel either. The rebellious genes have been bred out.

                I can’t claim to know the genetic story behind white timidity, but I do know we have been psychologically cowed–so to speak–by a relentless deluge of anti-white propaganda for the last 60 years. The reconfiguration of white consciousness has been both comprehensive and profound. Difficult to know how likely it is we will break out of the programming, but I don’t think it’s impossible. Soviet subjects endured something similar and look what happened to the USSR.

                    I can’t help either thinking that we’ve become so much more stupid and docile since the clotshots. If it isn’t a direct result of vaxx injuries, it seems that the whole plandemic fiasco knocked the stuffing out of people. As for the former Soviets, it’s true, they came back from the abyss, and what Putin has achieved is truly remarkable. However, the Russians in 1990 were very different from us today. Firstly, they were far, far tougher after all they’d been through, and secondly, despite all the Soviet propaganda, they still had a reasonably shared national identity.

        Just a minor point but I don’t think millions of Africans overthrew thousands of Europeans. The overt colonialism ended but a new era of subtler and more cost-effective economic exploitation — AKA ‘neo-colonialism’ — dawned. Puppet leaders were installed or ‘elected’, and the instruments of control became the World Bank, the IMF, multinationals, Western banks, NGOs, and a local comprador class of kleptocrats. This was an American innovation. More efficient. Allow the locals to think they’re governing themselves but make sure the flow of resources continues from south to north and let the local bandits have a small share of the swag. This has only started to change relatively recently as the Chinese offer better terms. When we say the USA is losing its hegemony this is what we mean (among other things).

The story is unbelievable. Literally. It reads like the plot summary of a bad girl power romance, complete with ridiculous plot holes and improbable series’ of events. Worth checking out for a chuckle.

            Only looked at a the first few paragraphs of the article but it seems like a spellbinding tale. On one hand she is described as the nicest person in DC with a sweet personality and on the other hand she was regularly called to the Obama White House in the middle of the night to give legal authorization to obliterate terror suspects on the other side of the World with drone strikes. Just the kind of woman you want to take home to Mama.

            I really cannot be alone in wincing when I read about the striped-pants spymaster “Avril” (nooffense to Ms. Lavigne, who I’m sure probably would be more capable in the job). Itjust guts me like a humiliating rerun of Hillary-for-President movies n’ TV shows that were routine during the W. Bush years. We have this elite now raised on the then-prevailing glam/gay image of government. Steve Sailer used to remark, apropos of Pride Month, that he remembered adult Halloween parties with slutty costumes inhabiting a fetish niche for Wall Street in the “conservative” 80s but which seems to have metastasized in the host since. Cosmo readers formerly got bullied by other women– I remember; I was there. The unironic e-tradwives on TikTok are symptomatic of this confused roleplay blender throughout all walks of e-life now. I’m uneasily becoming MAGA Communist/Luddite because of this cultural dislocation. I know that doesn’t make sense, nothing does.

                ” I see wine, cats and small press erotica in her future.”Did you notice that one of her stints as adventure girl was owning a quirky independent book store that held erotic literature readings?BTW, a key thing to think about when analyzing the article is the cost of her various adventures. For example, a 1961 Cessna 310 in close to flying condition runs about $100k. That’s one that needs some work, as hers supposedly did.Other stuff: Upper West Side girl from academic family is suddenly a Subaru mechanic while going to school fulltime, because being a Subaru mechanic must be super easy since proles do it.College junior with no prior experience takes flight lessons in Princeton, falls in love with the instructor, buys a plane, “rebuilds” the avionics on her plane and then embarks on a transatlantic flight all on summer vacation, because that’s definitely a thing you can just do. She probably read Avionics for Dummies. Okay, Amelia Earhart, Jr.Girl with no business experience sells the airplane to finance her quirky bookstore (by which we assume she had no loan on the plane, or she would still be mostly underwater on it and not have any worthwhile sale profit to put into the book store), got a business loan as a 23-year-old with no experience or particular assets. Renovates the building from the condition it would have been in after foreclosure for being a brothel/bar (a thing I have done — it’s not like a romcom montage).Then suddenly, law school and superstar in international intelligence.And all the guys fell in love with her and were in awe of her strong girl power.

        Well the flynn effect was a massive hoax since it didn’t even measure intelligence going up over the 20th century but merely people getting better at analytical thinking &amp; now even that has been “reversing” isn’t a good sign. That’s only part of the equation though, personality traits are heritable &amp; there was a measurable drop in what I would consider “good” personality traits from the early to mid 20th century. People love to blame the boomers for everything but they were the degenerative offspring of the adults who allowed the 60s sexual revolution to happen, among other things.Despite the US being a deeply divided multi-ethnic country the people were able to set aside their differences enough to control the general culture until it totally went off the rails in the 60s. I don’t think it a coincidence that things went haywire after two world wars wiped out a huge chunk of men &amp; had an industrial economy that let anyone with an IQ of 80 have enough income to have a house with stay at home wife &amp; kids. This after medical advances kept virtually every single person born alive to adulthood which is totally unnatural &amp; eugenics programs that tried to account for this were virtually all outlawed after WWII.Meanwhile in the backdrop of bitter multicultural conflict jews steadily ascended into positions of influence &amp; pushed subversion as they always do. Protestants focusing on the very visible catholic demographic &amp; the roaming feral negroes causing White flight provided the perfect chaotic smoke screen for them to infiltrate. The fact that country was being defacto ruled by the northern elites many of whom had near identical views as jews made the transformation even easier. With that the equivalent of a nomadic mold was allowed to rot society from the inside out which was basically a force multiplier of decay.Institutionalized feminism, welfare, medical advances keeping every single person alive to adulthood which is utterly unprecedented in human history, selection pressure favoring intelligence being removed due to industrialization &amp; estrogenic chemicals being pumped into the food supply set the stage for what we have today.Even if average IQ is still triple digits among Whites it’s effectively meaningless since the average person is a hardcore dysgenic supremacist &amp; the largest demographic hostile to what’s happening merely wants to rewind the clock without addressing root causes. Once the boomers go there’s going to be a huge decline because all the positions they inhabit will be filled by diversity which will ironically kick off the transition back to some semblance of natural selection.People alive a century ago wouldn’t tolerate even a fraction of what is considered normal today, they shut down milquetoast degeneracy in hollywood in its infancy with the Hays Code instead of imbibing it. They couldn’t be brainwashed &amp; yet a few decades later the population was fine with degeneracy despite still being overwhelmingly White &amp; christian. The people changed &amp; to me the obvious explanation is dysgenics, all the available evidence points to it.Never before in human history have people been allowed to stray so far from the natural laws that govern life on this planet. The cycle of ascension, decadence &amp; decay could previously only go so far due to the limits of technology but Whites effectively took control of their own selection pressure then proceeded genetically degrade &amp; ethnically cleanse themselves. They also bred &amp; technologically elevated the third world far beyond what they were ever capable of doing on their own &amp; poisoned the earth with toxic chemicals that will linger for centuries.In a sense what’s coming is entirely deserved on a collective level even if some of us as individuals had no hand in creating this unfortunate situation. I doubt anything will be learned from the coming catastrophe but nonetheless I hope that sober minded people survive while all those who deny observable reality along with those driven by blind avarice get utterly destroyed by the hellscape they created. At a minimum ethnocentrism is going to be a survival trait in the coming planet of the apes so that’s something at least. Plus the feeling of schadenfreude from seeing utopian idiots eaten alive by diversity will no doubt be quite entertaining to watch as the west dissolves. Gotta take the good where you can find it.

            The standard HBD response I tend to buy is that of an interruption of strict Darwinian “selection” due to the Industrial Revolution and a rise as Woodley has termed of “spiteful mutants”. We breed—and allow to survive—more and more individuals with high mutation loads.

                That’s a very good explanation for the ascent of a specific class of sociopath, I think first identified at 4chan and dubbed the “tranny janny”—the powermad (even in the smallest things) pervert.Deviate enforcersare a new kind of white people, and they rose to dominance very quickly. When I was young they only controlled certain slumming-rich-kid fringe scenes. Now they run the CIA.But normal white people are messed up too. Almost all men are testosterone deficient—visibly, audibly, and measurably. Women consider themselves failures if they’re *not* prescribed psych meds. Etc. It could be a long list. We’re overwhelmed by medical problems, like we’ve been mass poisoned.Being mistreatedisn’t dysgenics.

                    Testosterone deficiency.  A national plague.  Can’t tell you how many couples wife tells me about having trouble conceiving.  OK, so back in my childhood folks did not speak so openly, however we seem to be having a real birth rate decline don’t we?  This aspect of male sperm production is only one problem—sperm counts are lower than ever recorded and the damn sperm is weak and immobile in many cases.  Genetics or environmental pollution or whatever, it’s bad news.

        I think they have completely lost control of the system.  If sane people were running Israel they would tell Reps.

It should be a source of embarrassment to them and they should be worried about the backlash it will further provoke.

I disagree slightly.
I think their control has frayed a bit, but they still have domain over large, important parts of the system.
The more I look at their digital control grid, the more I think they won’t be able to meet its electricity demand. That would require a crash program of coal and nuclear plant construction beginning 10-15 years ago. There is nothing like that in the West.

                A large part of their control program will be based on AI. And AI uses 20x as much electricity as ordinary internet. What with their plans for EVs, I wonder how they’ll get all the necessary kilowatts from solar panels and unicorn farts?

                    AI does seem to be at the center of a lot of wishful thinking. The tech world is patting itself on the back because they think AI will allow them to hire rainbow-hued morons to sit at computers and look busy while AI writes the code and solves the technical problems. It’s their ace-in-the-hole that will allow them to fire all those icky White males who still clutter up the company photos in even the most pozzed little startups. Then of course, AI will figure out how to greenify the electric grid and drive all the EVs for us.

        From ‘The Fate of Empires’ by Sir John Glubb
XXXIV A variety of fallsIt has been shown that, normally, the riseand fall of great nations are due to internal reasons alone. Ten generations of human beings suffice to transform the hardy and enterprising pioneer into the captious citizen of the welfare state. But whereas the life histories of great nations show an unexpected uniformity, the nature of their falls depends largely on outside circumstances and thus shows a high degree of diversity.

                    Indeed, the same people start the wars to drive the immigrant drone swarms into the target zone.  The same networks run the wars, the immigration, and more horribly, the slave and child trafficking.
All of a piece.  Slavery is their system, their overriding theme.
This tells us where to start: capture the teaching colleges and the credentialing institutions.  From there, one can create a new priesthood to shape the mores and incentives of society.

        Today’s Z-man missive is persuasive, but to me not compelling. Something is missing.  I wonder if the decline in elite “intellect”, as judged by their inability to be effective in controlling the society, is solely a result of general IQ decline as we currently witness around the Western world and in general, HBD science predicts.One concept totally overlooked in today’s posting is that of “assortive mating”.  The elite, or upper classes if you will, dwell in their own world—one that is quite separate from the dirt people.  Yalies go to Yale, meet, work with, marry, and have children with other of such elite ilk.  This was examined extensively by Murray in his book, “Coming Apart”.  These cognitive elites exhibit few of the current social pathologies—and those to a lessor extent—than dirt people experience.The example cited at the end of the commentary wrt Congress critter, Crocket, is a non-sequitur.  Crocket is a low IQ Black elected in a low IQ minority Congressional district.  She is not one of the elites we (I) speak of.  Congress is full of such mediocrities.No, there has to be more to the failure of elites to control our present world situation as they did in the past—but being in general stupider seems lacking.  This is not to say we are not witnessing stupid people in charge of such events, only that they are not the best our elites can offer up.

            Yeah I agree with you. I have offered up complexity and hubris as possible explanations (see my comment). There are plenty of smart people out there, but they tend to avoid government for some reason. I think the sheer boredom and cat-fighting is part of it.

                Why would any high IQ, successful person go into politics.

But that’s the thing. They aren’t marrying anymore, and especially not having children anymore. So the total number of “elites” is declining, meaning there aren’t as many smart ones to go around. That’s before we get into the dumbing down of their “elite” educational institutions.

                That indeed may be true.  In there lies the mention of the elite “smart fraction” made by Z-man.  That’s however a numbers game more than a cognitive failure game.  As to the dumbing down of the elite institutions, that may be, but I’m talking where elites meet other elites, not so much what they “learn”.  I’m a strong genetic persuasion person wrt intelligence.

                    Talking about “simple calorie math” is also a cope. People are fat because they are not moving enough and eating too much. Check out the calories of the usual goyslop in the average restaurant. Even a “salad” can be 1k calories.

                        I used to think this, but now not so much. We are fat not just because of exercise, but because of processed food, which in the amounts consumed is toxic. Toxic in this case meaning the food creates havoc with our metabolism, especially wrt insulin.Why the change of mind? Simple observations of recent developments in drug treatment, i.e. “Ozempic” and derivatives. I’ve witnessed this personally in my family. Every damn one—male or female—who takes these shots has lost weight faster than a stay in a WWII concentration camp. It’s breath taking.Of course, the best—and recommended—results come from watching your diet in conjunction with the shots, but such is unnoticeable from what I perceive to be “normal” consumption choices in this society. Everyone seems to be eating the same trash they used to. Thank God, or I’d have no one to eat with—my diet being typical American junk/fast/processed food.Of course, will we have great risk here with this “grand experiment” as we saw with the Covid vaccine? Who knows. Unknown side effects may lurk down the road. However, life’s short and the overweight issue—the American disease—also has bad effects down the road as well.  Family members taking this have a very renewed and uplifted aspect on life.  There are few pleasures these days, let them enjoy.

        Too clever by half. Which is always the result when you get a ruling class that thinks so highly of themselves. They have managed to convince themselves that by importing an invasive species and allowing it to metastasize they won’t collapse the ecosystem and can thus manage it. We are finding out that is not the case. However, they will continue to attempt to manage the collapse by more and more desperate measures. You think the Ukraine and the approach to the Israeli mess is bad? They’re thinking right now of new and improved fixes that will make the phrase “hold my beer” look like a sane thing to say.

        Israel was jammed into the side of the Arab world, much like Taiwan and South Korea with China and Pakistan with India, to further longterm elite’s goals using divide-and-conquer, balance-of-power strategies. The goal is not to “solve” these conflicts but to manage them which gives our elites greater control over the region, as argued by the wonderful Guido Preparata in his excellent “Conjuring Hitler”.To clarify on this point further, there are two very long-term trends impacting the world (especially the western world): (1) theprivately owned nature of the world’s central banks, owned by the Rothschilds, Warburgs, Milners, etc., which prints fiat currency out of thin air and lends it to governments at interest, turning the world into a slave class (i.e. slavery never ended, it simply changed from a direct to indirect form and greatly expanded); and (2) the egalitarian ratchet effect, where the core western value of egalitarianism, ultimately deriving from Christianity, doubles down on itself over time as a ratchet effect, as discussedhere.The real question is which of these trends is more powerful? Ultimately I see the central bank parasitical class as piggybacking off the ratcheting egalitarianism but not the cause of it; therefore I suspect the ratcheting egalitarianism (which is totally suicidal) to ultimately subsume the West and for Islam and Africans to conquer the world, as discussedhere.All one has to do is look at along-term map of Islam’s expansion, which has never experienced any pushback except in Spain. This is why the West shouldsimply stay out of Israel/Gaza and withdraw support from the region entirely— it’s none of our business. The future of the world is likely much browner, Islamic, with a 20 point drop in IQ along with a gradual decline in technology entirely — a reversion to mud huts and fears of tribal djinns.Oh well.

                Yes, the Islamic world was easily conquered by the west technologically in the 19th and 20th centuries and did secularize for a time as seen in Ataturk Turkey, but this was an economic and military conquest, not a religious one.
And I agree, Africa as a continent is completely unable to support itself and relies on endless foreign aid, especially food foreign aid, to survive. It’s fertility rates are not declining at nearly the rate that globohomo has expected them to. And they are being imported en masse into the west as quickly as possible…

        It’s exhausting being exposed to endless examples of extreme dysfunction in our modern society, and the Crazy is accelerating and worsening. The luxury of erudite debate is an indulgence that will soon be pointless. We need to be ready for when the wheels come off. Militias are already forming and the 2024 election promises to be a trigger for real change, one way or the other. The Stasi is now preparing its standard technique of manufacturing scapegoats and making an example of them as a form of deterrence. Bloody clashes are inevitable, and that is real tragedy because the root of the problem will not be addressed in these actions. There is a better way, and far less harm will result from doing the right thing. The pathogens must go. Bite your tongue and focus.

                I’d argue that the dollar is different from other GRCs. Those were all nominally gold backed. But, more importantly, the global financial system is obviously infinitely more complex now and the dollar underpins the entire system.
Moving away from the dollar will be incredibly hard and will take decades at best – especially because there’s simply no alternative. I wish that this wasn’t the case, but it is.

                        I’d suspect that the entire Eurodollar system will need to be reset before China and Russia come up with anything. It’d be at this new Bretton Woods conference that a new system would be created.The Eurodollar system is unstable and will get even more unstable over time if we continue in this direction, so it’s bound to start collapsing.For example, if China, Russia and other countries really do start trading in other currencies, that means less dollars in the system. But there’s more dollar debt outside the US than in the US, so how do they service that debt with fewer dollars available?With few dollars available but the demand for dollars via the debt service the same, the dollar goes up in value. Ironically, a move away from dollars in trade would cause the dollar to go up, not down, which causes a bunch of problems.The global banking system is built on the dollar and treasuries, which are used for access to dollars and collateral. As Z said, the dollar is the grammar of the banking system. Something would need to replace not just dollars but treasuries. Even if there was an alternative, it’d take decades, but there isn’t.However, the Eurodollar system is so overleveraged and relies on such a relatively small amount of dollars that it’s hard to see how it lasts, but who knows. The best guess is that a rising dollar causes panic in the global system, which, ironically, causes a rush to the dollar, making the problem worse, causing more of a rush, until everyone gets together and says we need a different system.Regardless, take the whole de-dollarization story with a giant pinch of salt.

                            What, though, about this latest scare of another 2008?
The quick gist of it is that BoA alone is short on a billion dollars of silver delivery (along with all the other biggies, presumably,) while Chinese citizens are on a tear buying up the physical silver supply. It’s a China-sized short squeeze.China is also dumping treasuries, that is, or not buying them.
If lynchpin Bank of America can’t deliver, will it “crash” the domestic economy? How would that affect the Eurodollar, since it’s also technically a traded commodity, and thus affecting the US forex?

            The Roman Empire was as bloodthirsty as any empire, and lost quite a few epic battles and good men. Yet they lingered on for 600 years after Cannae.
I think the difference is Britain wasn’t all that warlike. They got their empire by know-how and pluck alone. Maybe Britain got lucky while it was riding the wave that all of Western Europe was riding post-Renaissance. Then they caught the liberalism virus which also befell Western Europe.

                The Anglos cared more about maintaining this control over the European landmass than they do or did about anything else, even at the cost of maintaining the British empire, the future of their children, or even the future of their civilization as seen in unlimited open non-white immigration, etc. I see the Anglos as a death cult. Of course there are always exceptions to generalizations and I could point to Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood” speech (1968), but the exception does not disprove the rule…

                    The English/British Empire was run by and for a small number of men who had access to Royal patronage.The average pleb still lived a short and brutal life.For all the wealth of the empire we still had slums and squalor until after WW2.As always, the elite lived high on the hog and the masses could just die as far as they were concerned.When the masses managed to improve their lives in the 1950’s the rulers decided to begin importing savages to knock them back down.The real shame is that the plebs are too stupid to see it.

                        I was thinking about why communism took root in Russia instead of more industrialized nations like England or Germany. Thought maybe Russians rather enjoy hardship. Pain is moral, and all that. Maybe a slavic thing, idk. Eastern Europe seems hardcore to me from across the ocean.
Anglo is more egalitarian— maybe that has to do with the high-handedness. As long as you’re trying to rise up, they’ll try to keep you down. A societal fitness thing? Again, though, my perspective is American. Throw in a bunch of people not wired that way, and the whole thing gets knocked off balance.

                    German ,French,Russians have killed many more Europeans than the Anglos. Britain saw Europe as a distraction and largely avoided trying to control Europe-that was more of a Russian/French/German thing.
Balance of power was not about dominating Europe…
France trailblazed  importing non-whites before WW2,also the worship of black American culture.
Your rule is based on a very poor reading of European history.

        Great post. I have always gravitated towards the theory that the current “elite” were brilliant Bond villains, effortlessly leading we peasants by the nose. However, whenever I hear Nudelman or Blinken speak, I began to realise that they are just idiots after all. However, the one big proviso is that idiots can get us killed just as easily as Bond villains.

        I think this is a product of overpopulation as much as declining IQ. For the next few decades the world will have more people than it ever has had. The US is the third-most populous country. All these people are inheriting a complex society and there are staffing needs. So you get both layers of bureaucracy and incompetence. But I suspect there are more smart people than ever before, but they happen to be in industries you don’t engage with daily. For most of us, we’re dealing with a whole lot of mediocrities, and a whole lot of dumbasses.In 100 years humans will be blessedly free of traffic and bureaucracy and over-regulation and all the trappings of current-year life. But there will be a whole lot more dumbasses and fewer mediocrities. The smart set will be identified and scooped up by the local potentate. I think our overpopulated world will be seen as horrifying to future humanity.

            The rise in world population is leveling off and will peak in a couple of decades, but it is going from there to decline precipitously.  Let’s not leave the audience here with the wrong impression.  That being said, the environmentalists are not satisfied and would enact strict population reduction laws to speed the process up.

                The world is overpopulated, especially if you want the whole world to live like Europeans.  I heard that in 1900, man and his animals made of 5% of vertebrates and now it’s 95%.There is no reason to believe African population growth is going to follow the trends of Europe or Asia.

                    Tars, correct.  Africa is always the exception pointed out in the predictive stat’s showing the demographic growth cohorts.  Africa goes nowhere but up.  There, the population reduction will be through war and disease when Western aid dries up due to our shrinking population and inability to afford foreign aid.  Our main task for survival will be to repulse the coming invasion of African “refugees”, so far we have done a poor job.

        Z-man — I agree that our elites got a lot stupider. However I would argue that they got stupider in the late 1980s. Reaganism showed how to win: Generic Americana, Defense Spending that employed White men, non engagment in risky wars only tomato can victories, enough flag waving to attract Whites without pushing away non-Whites. [There were failures: the border particularly]. Charismatic “Generic” American candidate and restrictive tariffs. And they went with George W. Bush.Dems went with Dukakis, then smarmy Clinton. They forgot the path to victory over the USSR: cheap energy, protective tariffs, welfare for Whites in Defense Spending. They created the “peace dividend” which was “Falling Down” in 1993.The “end of history” aka Russian / Chinese / third world weakness just masked their incompetence and decline in IQ.You are just incorrect re Israel. You are not seeing (because you are not looking) at the re-alignment of forces. “Whites” vs. non-Whites. Currently Japanese gamers are incensed at Ubisoft which has released the New Assassin’s Creed. Featuring Yasuke*, a black samurai** who slaughters Japanese who are “White adjacent.” Same as Hispanics after Trayvon. All those protests in college campuses are not about Hamasistan, but about pushing out certain people in favor of their tribe.Nor was there / is there any “control” over either Bibi or Israel. Israel has tried everything with Gaza. Leaving did not work. Bombing them intermittently did not work. “Deals” with Hamas did not work. Hamas per its public statements “is not interested in more electricity, more water, more food for Gaza. We are interested in Jihad.” So Jihad it is.Hamas-istan declared total war on Israel and they are getting it, good and hard. The criticism of Bibi is that he has not killed ENOUGH of Hamas. [All of Gaza is Hamas.] Kill about 40-60% of fighting men age 14-45 and the ability and will of the enemy to come at you evaporates. Sherman and Grant knew this. So did Ike and Patton. Old women, kids, and late middle aged men make a very poor army as Ukraine has found out.What exactly does the hostile Obama-led Admin have to offer Israel? The ICC is just the beginning, just like Trump Lawfare does not stop at Trump (hence his growing Republican Congressional support as they realize this); the ICC will not just stop at Bibi but down to the individual Israeli. What “deal” can Obama/Biden offer? Return of the Hostages (they are all dead by now). Hamas stop Jihad (silly White man). “Recognition” of Israel by the Saudis (not in the cards and worthless anyway).The problem is NOT Israel no longer being able to “manage” its adversaries. The problem IS their military advantage in planes and tanks and artillery being eroded by drones, more sophisticated and cheap rockets and missiles, and bunkered in adversaries. They built a Desert Storm military and face the modern WWI style enemy. THAT is their issue.And again you MISS the growing Global Identity. As nations fade, everyone is dividing up into White vs anti-White. White people back Israel, though within limits. Non Whites back Hamas. That is the Global Question? “Terminal Solution” to the problem of YT existing or not?*Yasuke really existed, he was a servant not a warrior for some minor lord in Tokugawa Shogunate Japan. He served for about a year as basically a court pet / curiousity before his lord killed himself and he was returned to the Dutch. What happened after that to him is lost to history.**He was never a warrior, “samurai” can be stretched into servant or armed retainer. Ubisoft has lost 10% of its value in the past week or so off this game that has alienated their #2 market after the US. And this applies to gaming in general. Whites and “White Adjacent” Asians are getting angrier as DEI/ESG invades games via Sweet Baby Inc (all black/female consultants) are mandated to “consult” i.e. wokify games to piss off gamers. Games cost $200-$400 million to develop and require bridge loans from Blackrock and others who mandate diversity consulting to get loans. The games themselves flop big time: Kill the Justice League being one example that cost Warners $200 million in their earnings call, but the game companies need the loans.What the ongoing destruction of games, movies, TV shows etc. does is create more and more angry White guys who are angry that their entertainment/fantasy that is mixed in with memories of long dead pets, family members, etc. are destroyed. And replaced with “put a chick in it, make her lame and gay.” Evil can only destroy, not create, and the destruction only makes White guys angry.

As nations fade, everyone is dividing up into White vs anti-White.He’s on record as saying that your skin will be your uniform, and I doubt that he perceives many immivaders as potential allies.He’s too provincial, though. He can’t or won’t shake off residues of the conditioning andcult indoctrinationwhich turned generations of Europeans in the USA into useful robots. To me, he looks somewhat like a conservative of the crown and altar variety who wants to repudiate the egalitarian founding but otherwise keep the USA. Well, the whole affair has been an biohazard since the very beginning, just like Protestantism has been a biohazard. She needs to be terminated with her so-called “States”.

            We know the IDF is not what it used to be because there are literally dozens of videos showing lone Hamas fighters dashing out of cover to place an explosive charge on a Merkava tank, then dash back into cover as the charge detonates and destroys the tank.
If they current IDF were a serious, well-trained, well-led force they’d never leave their tanks without the infantry-support to deter such attacks.

            Actual Japanese people are becoming more “white adjacent” because they understand that the force(s) arrayed against us are the same, but Asians in the Anglosphere are by far the most extreme anti-white bloc, and they’re becoming more hateful every day.

        The decline in American (and UK and European) intelligence is very real, more than 1 IQ point per decade by my calculation from SAT scores..Probable causes..smart people being outbred due to anti-family propaganda, increasing mutation load due to vaccines, pollution in general, neurotoxic fluoride in the water, and terrible public education (marginal effect)…Inbreeding amongst certain groups (Ashkenazi and muslims mainly) has also produced many damaged children…

            “and terrible public education (marginal effect)”While this may only have only a marginal (if any) impact on intelligence, it has a major impact on thinking and on the boundaries of what is possible or desirable.  I lump public schooling in with TV, press and radio and now internet for creating and dissemination of the mind virus of progressivism and neoliberalism.  Without the DEI (DIE) mind virus, the drop in IQ wouldn’t be having anywhere near the same effect.  Without the equalitarian mind virus, the drop in IQ probably wouldn’t even be happening to anything like the current rate because there likely would not be differential birthrates between the poor and the wealthy.  Feminism is largely the cause of this differential birth rate.

                I think Feminism is a problem, but not a sufficient cause.  Look, birth rates are down in most all countries that achieve some modernity and a rise in SES among the population.  Not all seem as rabidly feminist or woke as we are.

                    When I say feminism, I don’t necessarily mean blue haired man-hating female weirdos.  I mean the idea of equality and sameness between the sexes. The normalization of women working full time straight through her fertile years, even if she has a kid.  If you refuse to stay home with your first kid and instead turn it into just another expense, why the hell have a second one?

        Complexity exacerbates this problem. Yes, the people at the top of government aren’t as sharp as before. But they are also trying to manage a much larger, more complex international empire.I cannot tell whether it’s hubris or neglect, but the People in Charge think that they can run this beast with Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken, Janet Yellin, Jared Bernstein and Lloyd Austin. These are proven mediocre types. They say Jeff Zienst, the Chief of Staff, is pulling all the strings. He’s a smart guy but it’s such a sh*t show that one smart guy cannot manage it all.So efficiency cannot be the goal here. The System would appear to be optimized for the looting of the government. The only thing that will reform the System would be a stock-market or economic collapse that the People in Charge would be motivated to address.

        The problem with GAE elites is that they refuse to treat their preferred helots like helots. It’s all well and good to have a tractable class of worker bees toiling away to ensure the elites store more honey; but Israel demonstrates how you make those angry, Africanized (heh) honeybees tractable in dealing with their own Palestinian helots. You feed them and provide the bare necessities of life. You do not educate them. And, like the Spartans, you periodically cull a portion of them as a clear reminder to the remainder of who’s in charge.Instead, AINO lavishes preferential treatment on its imported helots at the expense of those having native origin. This is a reversal of the antebellum approach that used the tension between poor, uneducated whites and enslaved blacks to divert attention away from the elites. Perhaps the oligarchs were forced to switch preferences because the Industrial Age created the possibility of a new class of whites, the Middle Class, that were no longer so poor, ignorant or tractable. At any rate, it is undeniable that Middle Class whites are now slated for the bottom of the hierarchy and eventual genocide. Perhaps we need to take a page from the Israeli playbook in dealing with the new helots before it is too late.

            “…it is undeniable that middle class whites are now slated for the bottom of the hierarchy and eventual genocide.”Much to agree with here, except for the place of whites in a futurehierarchy. Non-white migration and miscegenation will no doubt diminish our place in society, which is already blighted by deliberate DEI policies. But those whites who are able to survive such designs will likelyfigure prominently inwhat remains of a much-reduced middle class. We see this in South Africa as well as Latin America. Those who will be at greatest risk will be working class whites, who could find themselves unemployable under majority-minority preference schemes. The self employed or highly skilled should be okay.

        This map proves what I’ve been saying that people’s fixation on IQ scores leaves much to be desired. Specifically look at the Balkans and the Albanian IQ of 82. I can assure you that the Albanians aren’t from some alien genepool like in neighboring countries. They speak a different language maybe, but they look the same as everybody else around there.

            The last very serious nerdy chart I saw had Belarus as the highest IQ country in the world, barely beating Japan, and that matches my experience. Your pic differs slightly, but not in principle: The best judge of IQ is an intelligent man’s eye.

            “This map proves…”Not really. What it proves/shows is a variability wrt the estimation of “g”.  As I’ve pointed out recently elsewhere, IQ is a rank order score and the differences of a few points is really difficult to attach much meaning to.  Estimating national differences has been even more problematic.  However, when the group differences become large as well as the numbers of individuals measured (for validity and reliability) then general statements about group/narional differences can be made.  Lynn recognized this as well as the possibility that countries such as Albania and the Balkan’s were perhaps poorly measured.The point being that such anomalies do not mean that the concepts of Lynn and Vanhanen were wrong in the main.  Expand their ideas out to West vs East vs Africa and you’ll basically conclude that IQ, or rather intelligence of the nation, has a high correlation to the economic success of that nation.

        the incompetence and the dysfunction of the west is part of the depopulation agenda menu. Turning the west into a worse version of brazil will result in financial global collapse, not just western economy getting destroyed.
The chain reaction will cause plagues, wars and famines to happen.
To succeed they need to take Russia and China down with them, that’s why I expect the wars to continue, that’s why you see world leaders getting killed.
After enough people get culled they can finance another empire and start over.

            I suspect AI will increase the divide amongst all factions through the distribution of reinforcing information true or false. CRT, 1619, DEI. If you have enough wedge issues you can keep the population distracted until the power goes out and the system crashes.The algorithms already do a good job of providing users with information they already agree with. To improve the system all AI needs to do is hide any information that would cause the users to question their ideology.A divided population are easier to control. No sane American wants the open border. None of us has any way to close it because the few who want it open run the government. If we had the ability to unite we might have a chance at influencing what TPTB do.The control of information will allow TPTB to keep us divided permanently. The saving grace may be the lack of foresight in not gaurenteeing a reliable and plentiful supply of electricity.

During the day.In the summer.When it isn’t raining.
There will also be plenty of back-up power, so long as the wind is blowing (not too fast/ not too slow) and there are coal/ gas/ nuclear plants running 24/7/365.

        Hard to understand anyone knowing the history of the region, with all the times Israel has compromised and given up land, to think “the Israel lobby” rather than the Left, is to blame. A piece on Israel that does not mention Oct. 7 or our hostages, but takes time to mention Israel “killing civilians”? (who refuse to turn in Hamas or even vacate when warned by IDF phone calls that, because hamas is hiding underneath their property, that they must leave). A lot of us have a totally different understanding of who’s on our side and who wants the only democracy in the middle east smashed by troglydytes.I disagree with little here, but taking the islamist side over Israel is too difficult to comprehend, unless one has not been paying attention.

            We are conflating the “Jewish State” with Jews and their religion.  The commentary today was wrt the State of Israel.  Much of your comment pertains to Jews in general and their religion.  If Israel goes away, Jews and Judaism will undoubtedly survive, but once again be scattered among those countries willing to accept them and allow such practice—but that’s a different discussion.
