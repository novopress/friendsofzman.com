        I figured the “pissed off” rant was more fake news, but apparently not.  This, along with his bellicosity towards Iran is not good – the kind of s*** I don’t want to hear.  It’s starting to look like Trump 2.0 is fizzling.  What he needs to do is quit talking tough about those countries and start going after these F-ing judges that are jamming up his domestic agenda.

            sadly, it turns out that biden was far more bolder than trump will ever be.  of course everything biden did was horrible, but he didn’t let judges get in his way.

                That had nothing to do with Biden’s Autopen’s “boldness” and everything to do with the fact that the judges were on his side.

            Almost hard to believe but it’s been like 4 or 5 weeks since we were all giddy at Trump dismantling USAID, locking down the border, and getting rid of affirmative action. To be fair, all those things are still in place, but since then, all we have gotten is total MIGA and it’s just embarrassing. We didn’t vote for more war in the Ukraine and for Trump to dismantle the First Amendment to protect Israel. Nobody advocated for RFK Jr. in HHS so he can declare antisemitism a public health hazard and demand Columbia explain why their student body has gone from 23% Jewish to 21% Jewish.

                I agree with your disappointments. “Is Trump worth it?”
If the cost of:* bringing back manufacturing jobs* dismantling USAID* dismantling DEI and affirmative action* stronger immigration enforcement
is:
* special exception to the first amendment that makes it a crime to speak against the chosen* boundless patronage for Israel, including attacking countries* infinity H1-Bs
…is the trade worth it?
It’s not even clear yet that we will get what is promised to us in the deal. But it still seems to be our best option.

                        The claim is that there has been a real change in that group.  That is, the people in that group with the money have abandoned the left due to the refusal of the left to see the group as non-white, with all the special treatment that confers.
If this is true, then that group is willing to take actions that will damage the left and Trump is the instrument of this change.
Is our best choice to support him?

                            Sure, hence the crackdown on campus and reductions in certain immigration categories.
And then the massive push to bring in East Indians instead of Muslims.
They have switched the weapon they are using, but the ultimate intent remains the same.

                            I find it hard to believe the plutocratic Finkels have been that obtuse the last half century. Ever since the pomos replaced the Marxists, the Left has viewed Isreal, andin extenso, the Jews, with mistrust at minimum, and loathing at maximum. The anti-white racism which is the Left’s core value–however erroneously, has since the late 60s, comprehended the Jews. The Finks and Blankfeins and Zuckerbergs are impossibly slow on the uptake if they’re just now hoisting in that obvious fact.

                    “Deal with the Devil” is a perfect metaphor for trades like this. There is a reason why you should never do it.Everything in the good part will disappear as soon as Trump leaves the office or sooner. Everything in the bad part of the trade will remain and eventually get worse.

You’re almost certainly correct.  But what are our other choices?  Oppose Trump?

                                And that’s the nub of it. Understandably, most of us held out some slight hope that Trump could be our Scipio Africanus, turning back the savage horde. But nobody operating inside AINO’s hopelessly corrupt, anti-white system, can do what must be done. It is physically and in all other ways impossible. Trump is less dire than Biden and Kamaltoe, that is our reward for electing him. Pretty small beer, huh?
We’ll all just have to go down with the ship and hope that those of us who do not drown can forge a worthy vessel from the wrack and ruin.

                    It’s not a good trade. One by one, we have nothing without a first amendment and the things he is doing will be used against us for any reason. Two, Israel is a rogue state and since when does tying your lot in with a lunatic regime end well? Three, we all know who is behind the mass immigration they brag about it. I am with EMJ on this being the central issue. Mass immigration is actually a secondary issue as Trump has proven multiple times it’s essentially an administrative issue, and USAID is a bureaucratic issue. Yet the issue of who runs our government is existential.

                Yep.
He will not take guidance from those who really know the score. Worse, he has no spiritual foundation. His ‘spiritual advisor’ is some New Age hag who pretends she’s a wise priestess. That is some hopeless shit right there.
It’s hard to admit you were wrong and need a new direction when you’re almost eighty. And Donald has a huge ego.

                        She’s just another pseudo-religious scammer.  Not even a very good one.
But Trump’s the one who listens to her, and the one who fetes her in public.
Like I said, I feel embarrassed for the guy.  He really does live in 1980.  Seems to be a serious dood and then surrounds himself with silly women and loses all cred.

            Let’s face it, we just want to control other nations and to have them be subservient to us. The idea that we can install a government to run a society that is the descendant of thousands of years of civilization and force them to heel to our whims is absolutely batshit insane.We installed the Shah of Iran. He was a thug and the Iranian people removed him. They don’t like us because we tried to impose that thug on them. They removed the thug and now we’re mad that they don’t let us pick their government.These people truly are sick. They have turned us into the evil empire.

            Indeed, and when Z said the nuclear war hawks should be removed from society, I totally agree and think that such removal needs to be permanent…Trump needs to stop throwing silly fits about foreign leaders who are smarter than he is, and settle down to rooting out all criminals in American government….And seriously, he needs to start ignoring all these District Court judges who have far exceeded their authority…and make it clear that he will continue doing it…If the Republican pantywaists have a fainting spell, get rid of them….

        It’s certainly a turning point in history. Russia is simply bypassing the American Empire despite GAE throwing everything except boots on the grounds. Btw, the fact that the boots on the ground threat is a bluff since we couldn’t gather, transport and supply a force that would matter is another sign of an exhausted empire.
GAE threw everything that it could at Russia – sanctions, the dollar and a huge, well-equipped proxy army – and lost. Ukraine will go down as our Syracuse. It’s new world.

                True. My point is that NATO could muster at most 100k-150k trained troops. It would take six months to a year to assemble, assuming Russia just lets them. This would strip every US base of trained combat and support personnel.If Russia allowed those troops into Ukr, they’d lose ~200-300 men a day (killed, wounded, exhausted), meaning you’d need to replace troops at that level for a year or so. This would never happen for a variety of reasons.GAE is all bluff when it comes to Ukr. The only leverage Trump has is that Russia would like to avoid nuclear war and would like to have normal relations w/ the US again. But that’s not much and certainly not enough leverage for Russia to make a bad deal on Ukr.

            They threw everything they had at Ukraine to fight off the Russians, but we didn’t have much to throw.  1970s America would have made a huge difference, probably even turned to the war against the Russians.  But it ain’t 1970s America.  We simply do not have the industrial base necessary to fight such a major war.  These morons are talking about fighting China.  China produces more steel than the rest of the world combined.  China could put 40 million or more men in uniform.

                The important thing about Ukr is that our economic sanctions and denying Russia access to the dollar didn’t crush them. I think most people knew that our military power wasn’t what it once was, but, now, our economic power and the power of the dollar has been shown to be beatable.
That’s why Ukr will go down as the end of GAE as the global superpower.

        I couldn’t believe my ears when I heard Trump threatening sanctions and tariffs. What’s next, he threatens to send more weapons? For a guy who talked a lot about what an idiot Joe Biden was, he sure is continuing a lot of his policies.The only card Trump has to play is to send Americans to go fight and die along the A-A line. Putin has correctly concluded that there is no desire in the USA to do that, except amongst a small insular tribe of elites who wouldn’t be doing any of the fighting anyway. But for some reason, Trump, the Washington Establishment, and the Eurocrats are all acting like it is 1944 and they are closing in on Berlin.

            Unless Trump is ready to cut off support for Ukraine, he as nothing. I think he might know this but has decided to let the money run out on its own. Zelensky said as much last week. He thinks that is the Trump plan. Given the general stupidity of Washington, my bet is they pass a Ukraine funding bill this summer and Trump signs it, while saying some more stupid things.

                As much as DC is not reading the internet and folks like you about Ukraine, Vance’s team does seem to be reading them. Unlike the others, he seems to have a much better grasp of the situation. Would be interesting to see what he’s telling Trump.

                        I continue to believe that much of what Trump is trying to accomplish will depend on whether Vance can win in 2028. The Blob will stall in hopes of a Dem or a cuck winning in ’28. Trump can get the stake against the chest of the Blob, but he’ll need Vance to shove it into the heart.

                                I don’t think that it’ll be fixed. I’m just saying the changes that Trump/Vance/some of the economic elite want made probably require Vance to win the White House to finish the job.
Their goals and mine are not the same, though their goals are a hell of a lot closer to mine than the Progressives/Blob.

                If he wants to bring Putin to the negotiating table, a Ukraine funding deal isn’t going to do it. Nor are sanctions and tariffs. None of this stuff is going to work because none of this stuff has worked. But, as we have learned many times over the decades in the foreign policy realm, Washington is much more comfortable doubling down on a bad idea than it is in acknowledging its mistakes and changing course.

                “Given the general stupidity of Washington, my bet is they pass a Ukraine funding bill this summer and Trump signs it”At some point (maybe soon) ZOG is simply going to be unable to fund this stuff any more. I just did my taxes, and the IRS is kind enough to publish income and outlay charts for every fiscal year in the 1040 instructions.For Fiscal Year 2023, here are the income numbers:Social Security and Medicare taxes, 26%Personal Income taxes, 35%Borrowing to cover the deficit, 28%The FY 2023 deficit was $1.7 trillion.Here are the outlay numbers:Social Security and Medicare, 39%Defense, 19%Interest on the debt, 11%You simply cannot have a functioning country much longer, let alone a country giving away tens of billions in foreign aid, when you are borrowing almost $2 trillion a year and you are not collecting enough revenue to pay for your biggest expense, which is maintaining old people.

                    This is why I think the most likely end for the USA is the same as Z and others are predicting for Ukraine. The money (along with competent people, good will, hope, and willingness to change course) will just run out. No one sensible, no one even close to being in touch with reality, will ever be allowed to be heard. There will be no dramatic “let’s cut the bullshit” speech. When that happens in Ukraine, the Russians will just roll into Kiev and put up the tricolor. In spite of my snark above about learning Russian, I don’t think they will show up to save us from ourselves. Some kind of Mad Max scenario may be the way it ends.

                    I’ve started getting anonymized recruiting texts for a scheduled “uprising” against “chaos.” (Remember when that was the official regimepower wordagainst Trump? An oldie.) It’s being sold to me, potential regime goon, as an expansion of the current Elon-focused stuff. The rhetoric is from the Bernie/AOC tour. The op’s “nationwide” coming out is scheduled for Saturday.The signup link I’ve been sent twice, which I haven’t followed, appears to be individualized, phishing style. So it may be a new kind of jeet scam. It’s getting harder to tell as Americans get worse at speaking English.I do associate with enough antifa guysthat I could accidentally end up on that side of the official ledger, and I do say things that a stupid person or LLM would categorize as “pro Luigi” (which is how they think of it, we know, from how feds talk on 4chan).We’ll see if there’s an event. It’s both too late and too soon for one, I think, but I don’t think like the government.

                    Eh, I’m not so sure. Western white man is pretty cucked when it comes to “violence.” It’s a staple of dissident thought that when the SHTF the boog is going to go down and there will be hell to pay, but I have not seen any indication of that yet.To the contrary Western governments are very effective at cracking down on white dissidents from Charlottesville to J6 to the Yellow Vest Riots in France and the farmer riots in Holland tot he truckers in Canada. The Yellow Vest ruckus bears much more scrutiny than it gets, because those riots were large, went on for a long time, full of white people, and relatively violent.And they didn’t change one. damn. thing.There may indeed be “one hundred seething normies” who would love to tear the left-wing freaks to bits, but I see no indication that they will actually do it.

        “The war in Ukraine will end by military means and then maybe there can be a negotiated settlement. That was the point Putin was making last week.”The attitude of the Russians all along has been that events on the battlefield will determine the new borders, the administration of the remaining rump Ukraine regime, and the peace settlement. They’ve been willing to listen to Trump, see what he has to say, what he has to offer. But he’s turned out to be nothing but a bloviating windbag, with little or no traction with the USA’s erstwhile European vassals. He’s overestimated his own personal importance, the importance of the USA, and the extent of influence the USA has on its European vassals. Plus he was looking for a quick fix — patience has never been his trump suit. But the Russians are patient and good listeners.In fairness to Trump, the Europeans are also completely misjudging the situation. They have no cards to play and yet are willing to go “all in.” What a bunch of worthless morons.There are broader changes taking place that will further diminish the importance of the USA. The new tariffs will be the last stake in the heart of the globalization project. Trump knows this cannot be sustained by the USA any longer. But this is fracturing the world into a number of competing trade blocs. For example, China, Japan, and South Korea seem to be establishing their own in a recent meeting — let’s call it East Asia Co-Prosperity Scheme 2.0. But these trade blocs — reminiscent of the interwar period (1919-1939) — will further diminish the heft and reach of the USA.

        It was clear to me from the start the goal of the Ukraine war was to get as many white Slavic orthodox men to kill each other as possible. They will NEVER stop pushing it . They will expand it to the rest of Europe once the Ukrainian the men are dead.   look at what is going on in NATO/EU Europe.  They are disqualifying and jailing any politician who doesn’t go along with the genocide of the native population. They will send their troops to Ukraine soon because they want french, german and British men be killed off too. Europe and the EU is firmly in the Grips of the WEF/EU/ Bankers, and their population has no say in anything. The young men who say they won’t fight are fooling themselves, they will be drafted.. The borders will be closed first then conscription will come. Their phones will make hiding impossible, so they will be called up and sent to die. NO foreign “refugees ” will be drafted though.If any of you know any young European men , help them get out now before its too late...Have a wonderful day .

            Those election deplatformings have less to do with repressing the proles, than with blocking Zionists from gaining enough clout to uproot the Globalists. When I looked into the Romanian election deplatforming, I found a literal mercenary company tied to the UAE interfering in the election. That was legit grounds for blocking their presidential candidate.
The people of Europe are still no threat to their globalist overlords. The Zionists absolutely are, enough so to warrant such dangerously obvious tactics. Every single time I look underneath the mask of a successful, “nationalist” politician, I find a big honkin’ Nose.

            My take on the Le Pen-situation is that nobody, herself included, wanted her to win because that’d force her to show her colors and the con would be up.So they bar her from office for a few years, her party hopefully loses enough votes to scuttle back in their designated second place when they run against someone other than Emanuelle Maricon, and Marine can go back to bleating about Islamic terror and the horrible fate of being forced to wear a scarf and so forth, the usual kosher-right agenda.The same reason, by the way, why Farage is now doing his best to blow up his party. Again. It’s because they’re professional losers and if they don’t lose, they’re not doing their job.

It does beg the question; who precisely was “Frederick Christ Trump”, and why did he strive to be Shabbos Goy Extraordinaire?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump
PS: Màiri Anna MacLeod was from the far Outer Hebrides [Tong, Isle of Lewis]. Donald Trump, and even Barron Trump, both bear a strong resemblance to Màiri Anna MacLeod.

        If you want to know why Western politicians seem to be so clueless about so much, it is because they rely on the storytellers called the media for their version of reality. All over Washington, staffers for elected officials read that Times story, shocked to learn that the American military has been running the war from the start. Normal people have known this since day one because the internet exists and people use it, but elected officials get their reality from the media.Exactly. The PMC grew up withAll the President’s Men,Network,Murphy Brown,House of Cards,The West Wingand finallyThe Wire.Worship of Ed Murrow, Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley, Ted Koppel, Mike Wallace, investigative reporting. It is 33% narrative-building, 33% travel and intrigue, 33% lights-camera-action, and 1% sex with interns. No wonder liberals love it so.They all assume that non-MSM figures are cranks who tweet from mom’s basement and make grainy videos that are “unsourced”, and that people who consume it are largely “uninformed”.

            I don’t understand why the Euros are hell bent on WWIII.
The usual reason of “unite our internal factions by attacking an external threat” may be it.
European countries (the one’s that matter, sorry Lichtenstein) are coming apart at the seams due to unchecked waves of African and Islamic immigrants.
They may truly believe that WWIII will fix the mess they made.

Right.  This is their mentality.  It’s called ‘programming’ for a reason.  Like song, it sticks and is the devil itself to break free from.  The Enemy made our spiritual and mental prisons exceedingly comfortable and attractive.
P.S. Don’t forget ‘Sex and the City’ and ‘Ally McBeal’.  Their disciples and spawn rule over us.

All the fools ‘giddy’ over the ‘official’ end of DEI have ignored all the DEI recipients embedded in the military ranks, and the politicians who are willing and anxious to spill White blood to defend anyone but heritage Americans.

Also agree that DEI has barely been scratched. People desperately want to believe that Donnie has killed it. Which is ludicrous.

        While is disappointing that the war will grind on, it is really no surprise. The US has nothing to offer the Russians. The U.S. has only two choices: Continue to shovel money and weapons into the maelstrom, for no long term benefit, [since there is no way to defeat Russia], or withdraw and leave the mess to the Euros.
Like the withdrawal from Afghanistan, I don’t care if it is a debacle. Better a debacle now, than a debacle after three more years of killing, destruction and waste.

        One of the most baffling things about the war is how bad it’s been managed by us.One the diplomacy and treaty breaking has been almost gleeful. The complete assault on the dollar as the reserve currency has been entirely done against the will of China and Russia.Weapon systems were fed into battle ONE AT A TIME. So that the Russians could develop counter- measures to each individually. Its like we developed a live action tutorial program to train our enemies how to fight the West. These weapons were meant to be used in combined arms and they just…. weren’t.The West has fought a low level war for 20 years. Our economies can take it. So instead of letting the Russians roll over Ukraine and funding an Afghanistan style insurgency that our economies can sustain, we decided to stress and break our dilapidated military industrial complexes that haven’t made a tank, artillery piece or truck in 20 years. The result is completely empty stockpiles of actual battle systems.It’s just incompetence all the way down. And even as Russians win and advance, our generals are STILL calling them insane. Success has no relation to their view of the Russians.And the sanctions that have only made Russia’s economy better than Germany’s!

            I continue to believe that the sanctions were supposed to work, that the GAE genuinely thought sanctions would succeed at laying Russia low and toppling Putler, and this explains why they didn’t have a coherent war plan. Because they never thought they’d have to back a war for longer than a couple of months.

                    Excellent point, that most ‘murkins once knew but have now all but forgotten.  Even though the youngerRussians want to dress and travel and party like western Europeans, their parents and grandparents haven’t forgotton the hard times and still value preparedness and self sufficiency.  US politicians are still all in on globalism and ‘one world’ bullshite;Russians are smarter and far morerealistic.

            Well the intent of the war was to weaken Russia hopefully to the point where Putin is gone but not to the point where Russia becomes Libya with lose nukes floating around. Nobody gives a shit about Ukrainians. I would rate it a partial success as the Assad regime collapsed without heavy Russian support.

        “If the Trump administration is serious about changing foreign policy, a top priority must be hunting down those people and permanently removing them from society.”I had high hopes for integrating Russia into the West after the iron curtain fell, but we’ve got too many bad people in our government. Russia is best advised to maintain an arm’s length distance from the west. The US doesn’t partner with anybody, they just want another poodle to boss around.And I hope Russia sticks it to the Jews who run our country. Maybe I’m wrong, but I feel like it’s their irrational hatred that is driving this whole thing.

        It’s fascinating to watch because as I’ve been pointing out for a very long time, Trump has a weak hand.  Sanctions won’t work.  More weapons won’t work.  The American Public has never supported direct war with Russia and never will.And won’t they be surprised to learn that the Biden regime went to war with Russia not giving a rat what the public wanted.  That NYT story is something Trump should carry out to the briefing room, bring Ratcliffe, Hegseth, and the Joint Chiefs with him, and say something like, “Can you believe this shit?  I said we were close to WW3, but I had no idea how batshit insane the CIA, military, and Congress actually are.”Then walk out of the room and make his dept chiefs take questions for a couple of hours.  When they’re done, bring them to the Oval Office and tell them they have 10 days to fire anyone involved in combat operations in Ukraine.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.  Trump’s best peace plan involves flipping the script and lining up with Russia.  It means investigating “Washington’s war”, and terror attacks like Nordstream, the Moscow opera, and the December missile attacks on sovereign Russia.  It also means fully cutting off funding to Ukraine, and a nationally televised speech to the American People laying out just how badly the Biden regime, the CIA, the Congress, &lt;i&gt;and the military&lt;/i&gt; lied to them.Europe continues to demand war with Russia.  Make it clear they are on their own and the United States will not assist them.  Announce a study on the future dissolution of NATO.  And then call Putin and say, “If they attack you, we will not defend them.”

        It would appear that Trump is advised by the Sebastian Gorka wing of his advisers. He apparently believes or did believe until very recently that:
Even though the West and especially the US started the war the Russians must give in to the West’s ” Rules based order.”
Even though the West was completely defeated and their equipment now litters the Ukraine landscape with over one million dead Ukrainians, that the losers in the conflict get to dictate the terms to end the conflict.
In what fantasy world has this ever been true?

        Peace in Ukraine simply isn’t important to the people who matter. Since Trump is mainly about Trump he may take the safest route (safest for Trump) and throw billions more at the Ukraine and let the war run its course.
Outside of Israel, the real battle is domestic and the left’s judges are fully engaged. Don’t worry. Republicans will have some meetings and write some strongly worded letters.

Reminds me of something I read on the Chans about how we had traitors within our government that knowingly procured substandard steel from China intentionally to weaken us.

        Yes, Russia’s interest in the Ukraine negotiations was simply to reestablish normal diplomatic communications with the US, especially so because that may preempt another close call on nuclear war. Trump’s interest was to bribe Putin into standing by while he bombs Iran at the behest of Israel. And apparently Netanyahoo has given Trump a deadline of April 20th to conduct the attack. Meanwhile, Russia has placed several S-500 air defense complexes in Iran to thwart this planned attack. Methinks Trump will have to back down or suffer a humiliating defeat.

He can install a Belarusian type of government in rump Ukraine and everybody will live happily ever after except for HATO vultures and the Jews.

                If he could MAKE Poland take ‘their’ part of Ukraine I bet he would be happy to. I have a Ukrainian friend that says, “those people” from Luhansk and Donetsk “are Russians, we should just let them go!”Woodrow Wilson got the Germans to lay down their arms in 1918, with the right of ‘self-determination’ a big part of his 14 Points. Lloyd George (British) reneged, and instead put a ‘peace’ together that makes the ‘Carpetbaggers’ look like saints.Back to Chat GPT:Q. Does Article 1 of the UN charter recognize the right of self determination?A. Yes, Article 1 of the UN Charter recognizes the principle of self-determination as part of its broader commitment to international peace and cooperation. Specifically, it outlines the purpose of promoting “respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.” This principle has been a cornerstone in decolonization efforts and the protection of non-self-governing territories, empowering groups to pursue autonomy and independence within the framework of international law. Would you like more details on its application in specific cases or historical contexts?— And that’s why the globalists can only say an election if RIGGED — since there really is no case against the Luhansk and Donetsk people voting their way OUT of Ukraine.…… it is IRONIC that questioning that ANY election could be fraudulent in AINO was a heresy … spittle and all from the hallowed halls of Congress. Yet….

            The thing is, I see no reason for Putin to want to feed millions of Islamists and Africans … and some Europeans. What might be interesting to consider is that he COULD, and these populations will be at the mercy of the modern version of the Red Army.

                Tired, hate to disagree, but no – “most people on our side” have NOT known this for some time.  Similarly, note Mycale’s earlier comment about how “we” were all “giddy” at the start of Trump 2.0.  Yes, patting myself on the back, but I was most definitely not giddy, and left a number of comments stating so.  Then I essentially sat back.  It’s why I’m commenting and responding less and less these days – my pov has largely diverged from the majority here.  The ‘left’ is not vanquished, Putin has no need to ‘negotiate,’ and the heritage American remnant is not ‘winning.’We may not have as many Mohammedan immigrants as Europe, but we have a sizable amount, plus more than enough Jews, blacks, mestizos, east and south Asians – to take down an already staggering and crumbling nation.  Nothing substantive has changed.  A few thousand aliens have been deported.  In the meantime, more than a few thousand aliens have been granted immigrant (as opposed to visitor/tourist) visas to settle on magic ‘murkin dirt.  And more of them are born daily with brand new magic dirt citizenship.If I were you, I would not change my long-term assumptions and plans.  Just use the briefrespite from active and malicious fedgov harassment to get yourself to a more sustainabile locale.  Meanwhile, sit back and let people discuss who will win the midterms and how Vance (with his highly questionable trajectory) will somehow ‘save’ AINO.  It is often entertaining, and sometimes highly informative, but ultimately it changes nothing.

There was undoubtedly a period of euphoria during the honeymoon stage right after Trump was inaugurated.  There were certainly positive developments, but people were getting out over their skis, too swayed by the onslaught of PR showman Trump was putting out without any tangible results to back up the hype.  I always appreciated your comments countering the irrational exuberance, we have to stay grounded and based in reality.

        If EVERY European nation decided to send their young people into the kill box that Ukraine is, it would only signal that they wish to continue to replace their own populations in an even more aggressive and obvious manner.Many historians believe Chamberlain made an emotional decision, guaranteeing Poland, after making excuses for NOT standing up for Czechoslovakia … that would have applied TO Poland … to the nth power —- far away in Eastern Europe, etc.Britain in 1938 had no more ability to puts ‘boots on the ground’ in Eastern Europe than they do today.But guarantee he did, emboldening Beck, the latter fresh off of taking a piece of flesh from the rump of the Czechs to get after some coal fields, following the dissolution of that nation after his Munich deal dissolved. Hungary got THEIR piece too, as Ruthenian nationalism and that ‘self determination’ the long dead former POTUS Wilson was so keen to see the way of peoples determining what government they had to live under — proved to be a charade. Repeatedly.Switch out Jozef Beck, Polish dictator of 1938, with one Vlad Zelenskly, propped-up Ukrainian dictator of 2025 — add on one feckless British leader Starmer for Chamberlain, and while history may not repeat itself … it certainly seems to be ready to rhyme.

            Roosevelt was pressuring Chamberlain to declare war on germany in 1938.
Do you think the Germans had any responsibility for declaring war on Poland or the USSR or the US. Maybe that was also Chamberlain’s fault using his mind control devices to force the Germans to declare war?!
You don’t get WW2  without the USSR and the USA and that was 100% the fault of the Germans.

                Hmm, can’t say I don’t need some citation for your contention. Opinions, like Jalapeno peppers can be ‘hot’ … but let’s see a citation.Chat GPT says:Q. Did Franklin Delano Roosevelt pressure Chamberlain to declare war on Germany in 1938?No, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not pressure Neville Chamberlain to declare war on Germany in 1938. Roosevelt’s approach during this period was more focused on encouraging international cooperation to prevent war rather than advocating for direct military action. Early in 1938, Roosevelt suggested an international conference to address the growing tensions in Europe, but Chamberlain rejected the idea. Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement dominated British foreign policy at the time, and Roosevelt respected the constraints of American isolationism, which limited his ability to influence European decisions. Roosevelt’s efforts were aimed at preparing the United States for potential involvement while navigating the complexities of global diplomacy.—- that answer cites archive.org, jstor.org and cambridsge.org, not Wikipedia.

        The main point of that work of fiction is to make clear that the Ukraine failure was not the fault of the Military Industrial Complex.If there are no indictments and prosecutions for the Ukraine graft, which is the tell, this tactic might work, at least with the NPC-like ruling class. We have to accept these people are both infantile and mentally insane.As for the rest of what you wrote, I reup that this madness is still likely to end in nuclear war. The political class and war profiteers in what formerly was known as the West think they are immortal. Whatever else he is, Putin is an adult. They are not. At some point to limit the devastation, Putin likely will have to vaporize a non-nuclear capitol such as Istanbul or Warsaw or Berlin to put paid to this madness (this in part is why nuclear-armed France has taken the lead); Article V is a known farce if it involves the ruling class’s lives and money. Otherwise, the final reel will end all life as we know it, which frankly is deserved at this point even though 99.99 percent of the dead would be innocent.

        The Ukes took a huge “L” in Kursk.  Their army might be ready to shatter.  If it starts and Russians get inside their decision cycle, it could go fast. The Russians take Odessa, surround Kiev and demand a new government to agree to the surrender.
Like the end of the Franco-Prussian War, it might be a wait for the Ukrainians (like the French) to get organized enough to surrender and sign away part of the country.

            The big question is what happens after the Ukraine army breaks. I wrote a year ago that one reason for the glacial pace the Russians have been on is they fear a collapse of Ukraine. A negotiated settlement has been what they want. At some point, they have to decide to win the war and face whatever comes next.

                Unlike us, Putin thinks about what/who comes next in Ukraine. This is why he floated the idea of UN supervision and new elections. The flip side to that is that if he doesn’t see anything viable on the horizon, he will likely try to gobble the whole thing.

                    The Russians are extremely conservative. In 2023 Putin did one of his all day Q&amp;A sessions and someone asked about after the war and it was clear he saw that as a big problem. In his most recent comments about the war, when he said the Russian army was ready to finish off the Ukraine army, mentioned that the progress was slower than people wanted and expected. I took that to mean they slow-walked a lot of plans to see if there could be a deal done with the West. Now, there will be no deal, so we shall see what they do.

                        Yes. I wonder if strategic concerns will dictate that the war of attrition should end and be brought to a satisfactory ending from the Russian perspective.

Or just England, if “peace” is the goal. In every situation, for all of living memory and beyond, war is their goal. We all have a favorite story about why that’s so—whether mass death is their primary, secondary, or tertiary goal, etc.—but the fact is out there.

            Considering they are actively jailing their political opponents who have been defeating them in elections, I tend to agree.  Years ago we all used to joke, “It’s a cautionary tale, not an instruction manual” about Orwell’s 1984.  But they are putting people in prison for stating basic biological realities in public.  And they seem desperate, bordering on maniacal, to start a nuclear war in Europe.

                idk, I think he’s doing his best to play with a clearly losing hand. Ukraine is toast. More weapons won’t help. American troops are off the table. More money will just be stolen by Zelensky. A lot of very good things have been accomplished, including the start of re-establishing diplomatic relations with Russia. I think also the American people needed to see what a petulant little toad Zelensky is, and just how war-mongery the Europeans are.The NYT story is a huge benefit to Trump, as well, because those who do pay attention have been vindicated as to just how close to WW3 we came. And those who do not pay a lot of attention maybe hear about how the Biden regime was at war with Russia all along. Trump said he could end it quick, but he can not credibly claim he said that before he knew that Washington was running the war and had troops on the ground.The mistake Trump is making is not forging stronger ties with Putin while cutting off military aid and money to Ukraine. I know he doesn’t want a collapse, but collapse may be the only way through the problem at this point. The pain is needed to get to the other side.Trump also needs to turn his gunsights on Official Washington.  Every CIA agent, every military member or DoD employee, every contractor involved in the Ukraine debacle should be immediately fired.  Then, offer to do a full joint investigation with Russia into the Nordstream bombing.

        These are not blunders. Trump has obviously learned some hard lessons from his first term. Perhaps the elite get their news from the media, but it’s obvious Blumpf does not. He must know a sizeable portion of the American people will be infuriated by drawing out the war in the Kraine. Many are fed up with Jewish policies being forced on America. He has to know finking on the Epstein files will hit his credibility square amidships. The way he talks – he must be drawing his info from the same places many of us do… possibly even this blog.Men like Trump do everything for a reason. Something big is going on behind the scenes.

            What was the point of what he did in his first term?
Didn’t lock her up, or anyone else, didn’t build the wall and didn’t drain the swamp.
Ordered troops out of Syria and they said no.
So what was the clever plan there?

                That was the exposure phase. I think that’s at the groundwork for us knowing what we do and taking action. I mean without all that behavior to back him up, we’re just still cranks spewing conspiracy theories. The fact that he is effectively shutting down government couldn’t have happened without the groundwork that was laid.Once he gets the Department of Education and all the worthless agencies down to 100 or less people in each agency, they are going to be fairly easy to shut down permanently.RFK doesn’t walk into HHS and immediately decide he’s going to fire everybody. This plan has been in the works for probably 8 years. RFK is obviously on board or he wouldn’t be there, but he didn’t come up with the details.

                Not saying that, B.The world – as our esteemed blog host noted – is changing. I believe that in 5 years you won’t recognize this place. Europe is going to either hang Starmer and Macrone and Von der Leyen or they’ll go up in flames… possibly this year. It’s conceivable that the US will get run out of the Middle East. A nuclear exchange between the arabs and Israelis is on the table and it’s possible the jewish problem will solve itself. Russia is now a serious power broker. Blumpf absolutely HAS to start cracking heads and stretching necks on the far left. If he doesn’t, they will do it to him…and come after us. There are a lot of moving parts in play.So many, in fact… no real plan could address all the fallout. Western Civilization is going to change profoundly, and soon. It may not look like it to us…but on the other side of the Great Divide – Blumpf has turned the world upside down. So much so they are attacking each other and keying each others cars.I think I see war coming…. But whadda I know…?

            You know, I myself have been repeating that line since 2015 when I started reading the red pill materials on the chans. A lot since then has been accomplished. If nothing else, there has been a significant amount of exposure as to what’s going on in our government. But 10 years is long enough. How much more do we have to wait? We’re all going to be dead by the time “the plan” is completed, everybody meets justice and we are all able to sit around with a satisfied smile on our face. Put up or shut up is where I’m at these days.

        “The Europeans have also made clear that they will never agree to peace.”
They said they would mot normalize relations with Russia, a far different proposal. Given that Putin is simply a typical Russian aggressor, such an attitude is understandable.
“…he said the Russian army is ready to finish off the Ukrainian army.”
The only army Russia is ready to finish off is the Russian army.

        So Putin refused the original  ceasefire deal and reinforced the message by adding conditions for future talks which meant Russia would offer no substantive concessions to Ukraine.
America wants Europe to fund Ukraine after the war but believes Europe has no right to determine what is the nature of Ukraine after the war.Trump supporters boast about how they despise Europeans and want NATO to end but don’t understand that this destroys leverage with the Europeans.
Looks to me that the dishonest and delusional parties to this peace process are Russia  and the US.

            I think a lot of us are not really all that worried about “losing leverage” with the Europeans.  They have begun a rather stunning collapse into authoritarianism with the arrests/convictions/jailings of prominent nationalist politicians who have been winning elections.  If the Europeans want to go to war with Russia, they’ll quickly have to go nuclear.  After the radiation subsides, we can recolonize.

        Please stop with the Ukraine news. Sure there is some pleasure in seeing the people on the other side take a political loss (shadenfrude) but all the Russia/Putin boosting is ridiculous. My daughter got her useless 4 year BA in Moscow (no ridiculous student debt). Moscow and St. Petersburg are now nice cities but the bulk of Russia is poor. The majority of the Russian army is poor boys from the equivalent of “fly over country “. Oligarchs have spent more money on yachts than the government has on the Navy. From a hardware point of view their military is out classed by the largess provided to the Ukrainians. Putin talks big but only Crimea and one of the 4 Oblasts he claims is fully occupied by his military. So just stop. Our future is being decided here not the Donbas. Instead of fantasizing about wonder weapons how about trying to figure out how to get Normie off the couch and onto the streets?

What do you think our army is? But at least their army is being operated by their own people for their own Nations interest. Our military appears to be operated by and for the benefit of certain special interest groups.
