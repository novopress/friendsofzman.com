        I could not listen to the hearings for long — had to come back to them. The shrieks, bleating of lies, and sheer fact that the most mendacious, pusillanimous creatures infest the heart of our government was just too sickening.Obviously these are weird theater kids, grown old. No one else could garner this much ‘outrage’ while at the same time personifying the rot, offshoring, and celebration of the ‘first female Admiral’ — in fact a fat J-ish guy in a wig ….that has long undermined the nation.I mean, really, these criminal geezers are clearly triggered by any threat to their Big Pharma paydays — pretending the jab worked, harmed no one … their sacrosanct ‘vaccines’ in a time when studies are showing the link to autism (hey Pocahantas … ‘splain’ how that destroys more children than ever) …. let alone their war crime aka ‘safe and effective.’A Communist screaming about infant clothing, a fake Native American, shrill, eyes bulging …. is there room in Gitmo Mr. President???

            The New York Post has been pushing so hard against RFK Jr. And claimed that the stunning and brave Congresspeople totally wiped the floor with him. It’s totally bizarre considering the rest of their coverage on Trump and so obvious that a lot of people in the health “care” field are panicking and pulling out all the stops to get this guy out of the picture.

                I refer to that POS rag as the New York “compost” for good reason. I know the crew here is down on a former syndicated writer named Beale, but his blog is a first stop for news, linked articles – and I just ignore the comic, etc. stuff since I am adult. I bet he gets more eyes than the MSM places. Can’t say I am into ‘baby metal’ either, little is more pathetic as a source of musical entertainment … IMO but I speak for one man, me.That said, I see a place like Kuntsler gets 3x the posts we see here — but much LOWER quality comments AND that guy slipped cover as a bloodthirsty ‘Amalek’ killer when he lost control of his self. Same for the ‘Ace of Spades’ guy, another one triggered into calling for every last ‘first born of’ an Arab people to be wiped out by cluster munitions.The New York compost? Would not call that “news” so what does that leave?Agitprop&gt; T &amp; A? Some armpit of the fallen culture and pro-Izzy — no missing that spin — shitpieces. They really all deserve one another, this gaggle of low IQ, amoral, stupid as fuck … ‘people’ we find propped above and below us.Thanks for taking time to comment.

lol
It’s a gauge. How much they can cram down our throats sans objection. Insufficient objection? Bring on the crippled tri-sexual dwarves.
Right off I assumed the ‘leak’ from Wuhan was probly controlled release. We owe the Pangolin Community an apology.

                Yeah like I had nothing against Pangolins. How could I, since I never heard of them?
My bet is the ‘strength’ someones told us ‘diversity’ was just cut a fucking passenger plane in half — counting down to hear it was some female – flying like Buddy Hackett in It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad World. I might have missed a mad.
Prolly diversity on both ends – retard in the tower, retards in the cockpit.

            Their disgusting faux outrage and high moral “superiority” is absolutely sickening.  I cannot stand these demoncrap s***bags.  You just can’t hate them enough.  With Trump, he at least tells you what he thinks and/or believes.  On the other hand, turds like warren or sanders start the lying the minute they open their ugly traps.

                Every time I drive by one of these shitlibs (and churches) with “Hate blah blah here” I give them the finger. HATE is a force God issued men to protect our loved ones and WHAT IS OURS.I love hate. Drives me to compete in sports and business. Thank you God for the gift of HATE. Plus, the gift of the Holy Spirit no one ever mentions – look it up – DISCERNMENT.Yes, not ‘speaking in tongues’ or ‘prophesy’ — I will leave that to Jim Jones, a good friend of the Pelosi ‘woman.’Discenrment, aka knowing what’s what. Like Admiral Levine is a loathsome degenerate. The Graham guy, same.

            As Mark Twain suggested, Congress is our native criminal class…It’s all about money, our kids’ lives mean nothing to them.The big statistical analysis found that vaccines cause crib death and autism, both horrors that scarcely existed when I was a child..In the otherwise contemptible EU, drug companies can’t even advertise on television, and 30+ food ingredients used in the US are banned as harmful…I suggest that every Senator who votes against RFK be sent to Guantanamo for 6 months of re-education…..

                That brings up an interesting quote by a doctor in, I believe, 1839?He said he’d never seen cancers before until vaccination; now, some years after vaccination caught on where he was, he’d seen 200 cases.
In other words, there may have been a tradeoff. Is there any historical record of cancers being a thing in the past?
Livestock owners, you vaccinate your animals; are cancers a thing in barnyard animals like they are in dogs? People used to dress meat all the time, so they knew if something looked off (and inedible.)

                    We’d get maybe 1% when I was a kid. Usually not lethal, surprisingly. I cut out 4 or 5 eyes and stitched them back closed in my teens. Nasty, stinky stuff. The absolute worst. A couple teats. Most were somewhere in the dewlap.

                These people sat back and got filthy rich while they made us fat. Made us sick. Made us poorer. The stuck a needle in some arms. Not mine.
And because despite their depravity and criminality, since they ARE pathetic theater kids, they still have this need for us to love and respect them.

            I gave up watching too. It was a shit show. These things always are. “Hearings”? They’re more like ‘shoutings” and in Warren’s case – shreikings. This is how the current game works – let us pick on our Esteemed Blog Host as an example:Senator Filthie: So, Z – are you still beating your wife and kids?Z: Well, Senator, I never have –Senator Filthie: Just answer the question!!!! Yes, or no!?!? Are you still beating your wife and kids???If Z tries to explain he never beat his wife or kids – I’ll talk over him. If he tries to reframe the question I will interrupt and shout him down and make other accusations. At no time can he be permitted to speak or defend himself.The idea of these things is to HEAR the players and HEAR what they say. Both sides do it, and We The People need to put a stop to that shit. I want to hear what the players have to say. Donks, AND the Repubs. The hearings as they stand, are infantile squabbling. As are the press conferences. It’s basically the same way up here in Canada… and if we want to run serious countries, we need serious men with serious debates. The current regimes have no constructive way to deal with honest intelligent dissent. All they have is “gotcha” and hatchet statesmanship.I can’t wait to see what they do to Tulsi. It’s gonna be LIT.

                Funny how the most courteous and civil hearings were the UAP(UFO) ones. They really dont care. There isn’t any lucre to steal or power to be grabbed. If they can’t use something  to put their grubby fingers on other people’s throats or wallets… they simply can’t be bothered to work up a performance.

                My 90 year old mother agrees with my sentiment, how a certain ruler had a “night of the long knives” and the only ‘egg’ broken was some music teacher.
She agrees with the sentiment that we all HOPE Trump meets and exceeds all these “Schickelgruber” comparisons.
To her credit, since she is still all there, she now sees the entire WW2 narrartive, etc. was all lies, all down the line. Quite a thing for a person her age but she still has an open mind. Makes great food every time I see her too.

            I’ve some personal experience flying in that airspace. It is extremely congested and has unique challenges due to prohibited airspace (P-56 area..ie the White House and Capitol building).It’s all speculation now; the most interesting “take” I’ve seen thus far the NTSB can investigate pilot/ATC error or accidents, mechanical/design failures BUT:It cannot investigate cyber attacks. Cyber forensics is barely a thing.There was a program started under Trump 1.0, but it was cancelled by Biden.Just something to consider.Personally, I think that airport needs to close to civilian traffic and send it all out to Washington Dulles.Congress critters love it though. You can be certain EVERY ONE of them flies into DCA on the regular. They’re all thinking “My god, that could have been me!”

            I’m perfectly willing to blame diverse controllers when the blame is due, like the near-miss in Texas last year in which a Negro controller cleared a FedEx heavy to land on the same runway he had cleared for a Southwest passenger flight to take off. In the fog. The white FedEx pilots saved hundreds of lives.However I do not think the DC crash last night was attributable to diversity, although the controller does sound like a young black. Apparently they were following established procedure in congested airspace. ATC requested the helo maintain visual separation, and the helo pilot affirmed he had the passenger flight in sight. He was mistaken, which was easy to do at night over city lights.

        I remember the first time I heard the term “gain of function” and thought it was totally bizarre – “we need to make these super powerful biological weapons so we can…. Make a vaccine in case the BAD GUYS make the exact same super powerful biological weapon.” You can think about this for about 12 seconds and realize it makes no sense whatsoever, and the obvious conclusion is that “gain of function research” is just the label they apply to bioweapon research. Of course tracks to Fauci’s recent pardon, which is backdated to 2014, when the CIA took over Ukraine and set up bioweapon labs (as Nuland let slip during a hearing).Lyme disease, MK Ultra, the list goes on – the American government is NOT our friend and has been using us as test subjects for a very long time. It’s ruined our mind, bodies, and souls and we need to find a way to take it back.

            “Biolabs” is an airtight one-word case for Russia to take Ukraine (and nuke every NATO city, if they feel like it). Since the invasion, Putin’s brought it uponce. He dropped the subject as quickly as the American media did, once Nuland spoke. To globohomo—of which Russia is a part (the Archie Bunker character)—”biolabs” the single most important thing, the core of Our Democracy thatmustsurvive.Democrats assing it up at Republican confirmation hearings is normal, but the RFK show was more intense and stupid than usual. Why Warren and Bernie? They’re the ones with the most RFK fanbase overlap. Their rhetoric (fake) and his (not entirely fake, and maybe entirely real) have been similar—until now.

                You’ve got to wonder, given what’s already come out about Wuhan and the Ukraine bio labs, if America puts theREALLYdirty, crazy, alien-human hybrid** type mad-science schemes in our vast network of foreign slave countries. All we get in Murrika is poorly thought out pharmaceuticals and food additives. It’s not hard to extrapolate things like MK-Ultra continuing into the present but with better security and more aggressive tying up of “loose ends” if you get my drift.** I don’t really believe inthatparticular X-file but I’m sure there’s stuff at least as creepy being done somewhere at Murrika’s behest.

        conspiracy theory of Lyme diseaseThe one I’ve been wondering about is another new tick-borne disease that causes an allergy to red meat. I had never heard of it until an acquaintance of mine came down with it several years ago.I want to make clear that I have never heard anything at all regarding a conspiracy around this disease, nor any evidence that would suggest such a conspiracy. It just seems to me that an allergy to red meat is a very weird result of a tick bite. It seems highly complicated, highly specific and lacking in any real explanation as to why a disease with such a weird symptom would develop naturally in the first place, and emerge right when the elites are waging a campaign against the proles eating meat.

            Wait, what? I remember reading about “researchers” pursuing “vaccine” or “medication” to make people have a negative reaction to meat, to save the planet from cow farts or whatever. Memorable because it was one of those “wtf?” moments, an irritant along the lines of “how stupid is this.”

            Alpha-gal syndrome. There are variants. I contracted one during the height of Covid while repairing fences on my farm. It came quite close to taking me out of this world. Since I had a variant, the reaction to red meat was not permanent, which is fortunate for someone who raises his family’s own beef. Do not discount conspiracy here. There are new variants showing up routinely now and no one has been able to offer a satisfactory reason that just involves natural evolution.

            It probably happened by accident, because evolution is shots fired blindly into darkness. Occasionally a super-convoluted trick shot hits. A disease that so perfectly pleases our masters is beyond the ability of The Science™ to invent, as far as we know.
But once it exists, it can be farmed like anything else. Labs around the world can Mendel around with it to encourage “desirable traits,” and once they get the ones they want,weget it.
Deducing those traits without our understanding—like identifying race from a rib x-ray—is one of the handful of impressive things “AI” can actually do.

            I think the “Covid effect” may be spreading. Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more YouTube videos coming out about the asteriod Apophis. Some of it is sensational click bait but I’ve also seen a lot of promotion of the idea that “we miscalculated the orbit and it might hit us after all”. In case you’re wondering, this is a rock about 300 meters across that will pass within about 30,000 km in 2029 and then do another close pass in like 2036.I have a physics background and could make the time to read the research papers and run some basic computer simulations if things start looking more suspicious. The impact energy is something around 1000 MT according to the things I’ve read. That’s 20 Tsar Bombas. It’s not world destruction but could level an entire small country and an ocean impact would raise huge tsunamis. There are also possible climate effects such as an “asteroid winter” from all the dust and smoke. Actually the first thing I need to check is if they’ve got the kinetic energy estimated right.

        This is one of those times it doesn’t matter at all what “the people” think. The cost of confirming RFKJ is so astronomically high to certain PTB, that the political cost of denying him is not a consideration. If refusing to confirm him damages or ends some political careers, that is a price the PTB are willing to pay. It will be nothing short of astonishing if they are able to garner 50 republican votes to confirm him. To be approved, he would probably need some D support, and I don’t know if that’s coming. Even that may not be enough. And most of them are not at risk anyway. What, is Massachusetts going to turn on Pocahontas? McConnell, in his final term, reveals his true self to the rubes who kept sending him back there. I don’t enjoy applying that name to mostly decent Kentuckians, but it unfortunately fits. They elected him, over and over and over.

                That only works if you get a sympathetic person in the top job who is willing to let it happen. The senate will do everything it can to ensure that whoever is in that job is loyal to them, not to Trump or RFKJ. Probably the only counter is leaving the job unfilled and the president running HHS directly, which he is legally empowered to do, if I’m not mistaken. And RFKJ could advise him on how.

            What could be truly hilarious and delightful is if the Central Clown Committee decided that Senator Slimesalot needs to fall on his (more likely her) sword to save the Pharmaceutical States of America and xhe or xhim refuses to do so.

        Life advice about arguments that I give people who work for me: if you get visibly and audibly angry, you lose. If they’re screaming, and you remain calm, you’re winning.Once the screamers realize you’re staying calm while they scream, it tends to lead to even louder screaming as they double down on the strategy. It’s incredibly difficult to reel rage back in.Any 3rd party witness to the argument will side with the calm person, even if they don’t necessarily agree with their argument.The GOP learned this the hard way in 2023 when they engaged in performative theatrics in the House hearings with John Durham. They were roundly mocked by Republican voters because everyone knew it was an act: the GOP would do NOTHING, and in fact afterwards they did NOTHING.  The people who were also supposed to hop on the rage train didn’t get outraged on cue.  The screamers not only lost…they went on to prove their detractors right.

            Among adults i’d agree with your statement, but we live in a society of never ending teenagers. If what you state is true, most of woke wouldn’t have happened.  I used the tactic you talk about when arguing with a girlfriend, and you are right, but that is when they turn on the tears.  Who does the 3rd party side with then?

                Had an argument with a particularly crazy woman/gf/whatever she was, a lifetime ago. No third parties. For once, I didn’t take the bait and get upset. When she finished spitting bile, the tears started— and honesty. It was strange and whipsawing, too much bad blood to be fruitful. Upsetting and regrettable it had gotten to that point. FWIW.

                    I taught kids for many years, professionally, and when you don’t react to that what you’re really saying is, “Your tears have no power over me.”People give up their personal power when they allow themselves to be manipulated by appeals to emotion.  Never give up your personal power.It’s also a classic logical fallacy: ad misericordiam – appeal to pityIn my original comment, I wasn’t referring to 1:1 types of arguments, though keeping your cool is just as effective in those situations.  But in meetings (or committee hearings), the cool cucumber usually wins those exchanges as long as he sticks to the facts and drives his points home relentlessly.

BRO.
That’s when you gotta slide her The ‘D’.
When you’ve broken her soul like that, when  she melts, when you slide her The ‘D’, when she can’t stop orgasming for you, that’s when she becomes your love slave for life.
Gotta break her soul.
Nice Guys always finish last, because Nice Guys refuse to get into the soul-breaking bidness…

                        Yes, but at that point she’d become utterly repulsive to me, and the glimpse of the person I’d known was— I mean, it was too much, too drastic. Which had been the dynamic all along, dialed up to where I couldn’t deal with it anymore. It was its own manipulation, abusive really.  Better to put it out, I thought, or hoped. Oh well, idk, ancient history.

                That ALSO has a very limited lifespan.  Remember, that strategy was used (effectively, in the short run) to get people to wear masks.  But over time, the crying strategy falls apart because people go to that well too often.  Emotional blackmail was also the main manipulative thrust behind Project Ukraine…it also failed…the public never once submitted to that strategy.
I taught kids for 10 years K-12, math and reading, that strategy only has a limited lifespan and people build up antibodies to it.
Your comment reminded me of this scene from “The Whole Nine Yards”…

                    I agree, i think the election points to what you’re saying.  Around early September i was out with friends and one of the girls kept trying to bring up Trump and how awful and blah blah blah, nobody was taking the bait.

                        Yep, that’s why the Harris shock and awe gaslighting campaign fizzled by mid September (which I predicted). People know how that works post-Covid and post-Ukraine. It’s why people yawn about Israel now, and why the pro Pali protesters didn’t win any converts.

                100% right. I recently was involved in a business meeting for a large contract my company is pursuing. The people in charge on our side are smart, capable, men, but it was clear going into that business meeting that they had not mentally prepared for it. So I got them all together at the hotel and just started asking questions. We spent about 90 minutes on what was, ultimately, a damn fine dress rehearsal of the business meeting that followed the next morning.Because they not only got their basic key points nailed down – what do we want out of this meeting – they also had time to sleep on it. Sleeping helps your brain organize your thoughts.The next day, even though the topics were varied, the preparation and command of the facts led to a successful business outcome. Nobody got flustered, nobody got thrown off their game by some of the random/sensitive topics, and the result was a very positive experience for us and for the customer.

                Ironically, Trey Gowdy is arguably had the single greatest impact on Trump’s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton. This video, shared on social media, directly led to Clinton’s defeat.And, with the addition of MAGA voters sharing video of Clinton passing out and being shoved into black SUVs, this video is why Fakebook, Twitter, Google, and others engaged in massive censorship.I predicted it at the time. Social media elected Trump in 2016 because it evaded the media gatekeepers. It led to the government censorship that followed. And the breaking of that censorship (mostly) in 2023-24 (Elon’s purchase of Twitter) led to Trump’s 2024 win.I understand that other commenter’s (Mr House) reply about “crying”, but at the end of the day, a calm, brutal, summary of the facts wins every time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opPh9uG29cQ#ddg-play

            Sadly, most of today’s society operates at the level of a Worldstar video. There are no rational parties at all and eventually even the person filming the madness throws down the phone and screams “I’m ‘a keeel u niggra!”.
It’s why I’ve been avoiding public places since the Coof. I realized that at any time, anywhere, and for any or no reason, some preposterous idjit, always a wammen or soyboy, will start screaming at you while calling you Hitler and filming you with her stupid little cracked-screen sailfoam.

                Most people are far too afraid of being seen doing that unless I’m stupid enough to put myself in a situation where the screamer is surrounded by dozens of like minded screamers.
I don’t give them power over me because (like you) I avoid places and groups of people likely to try it.  In the end, they’re left howling at the moon.

        Speaking of conspiracy theory versus conspiracy facts, I came across something interesting on twitter recently. A channel (JQ radio) plays Hitler’s English-translated speeches with full rendering using AI. Thousands of people are listening and finding him articulately describing all problems of contemporary USA, Canada and UK.
in the meanwhile, the “good people” are still calling others Hitler and thinking that would close the deal in turning people away from their enemies. I saw several references to hollow-cost in the jfk nomination.

            Remember the (mostly) New Jersey UFO sightings of late last year? Very recently there’s news headlines say that Shucks folks that was just the state of New Jersey with some kind of special FAA authorization and they were doing some kind of testing. Now granted I didn’t read any of the stories but as a general rule when you’re going to be doing extensive testing that might alarm civilians you would normally publish some kind of advanced warning which I recall hearing absolutely nothing about.

        Let us hope that the biggest lie of all sees the light of day this year, for that will be truly transformative. Hiding is plain sight is the reality that a significant cohort of the Cloud People are seriously evil pedophiles who continue to prey upon defenseless children right under our noses. Many are reporting on this, but the critical mass of awareness is not yet here. If Trump is serious about the revolution, he needs to step up and throw open that door. And Musk could lead the way for him via his X platform.

        Just as the majority of Americans were happy to see the end Biden, we are pressing thumbs that Olaf Scholz and his clown circus will be gone by the end of February.As much as the AfD party has been demonized, Friedrich Merz from the CDU party, (who is likely to become the country’s next chancellor), just recently tabled the motion for a stricter migration policy including permanent border checks, which narrowly won the vote due to the support of the AfD party.Of course the left will start crying in the streets with visions of WW2 steel helmeted German soldiers stopping cars and commanding “Reisepass bitte!” The fact is border checks in Europe have been in place for at least the past decade. Especially when crossing from Germany into France, the NL and Switzerland. And not right at the border either, but several kilometers into the country. I’ve even passed through some French control points disguised as road construction zones, with lanes closed and with no means to turn around and go back.I don’t expect the CDU and AfD to become a coalition party anytime soon, but it does show the influence of AfD in conservative policy making. Hopefully common sense is making a come back even here.

            The significance is any sort of alliance with the AfD happened at all, no? I find that interesting and suspect it might signal to the rest of the Europe that nationalist parties no longer have to be shunned. I’m not certain here, but aren’t mechanisms available to the German state to overturn legislative results? I know political parties can be outright banned.

            Hopefully common sense is making a come back even here.I began to learn during my first visit to Doitchland, back in the 90’s, that the common sense (or public avowed preference) of the people is itself a great political problem. Imagine overthrowing that common sense in favor of some very painful truths about, say, how resident Jews and foreign powers boosted Hitler and his allies into power. People will be saying “Holocaust” and “own goal” with the same breath, esp. after learning that Jew Hugo Preuß helped mightily to impose the Weimar Reich’s constitution, thereby centralzing power in Berlin and fomenting chaos expoited by the Nat Socs.I can’t unlearn the belief that the Nat Socs are somewhat to Doitchland as the fanatics of ISIS are to the Middle East. Oh, andHamas was paid by Israel, which is often opposed by the people called leftists, who rage and fume against National Socialism, the defeat of which made the establishment and perpetuation of the State of Israel more likely.   The war itself appears now as an op to kill off millions of Evropeans and to make Evrope safe for Israelist supremacy ever after. What happens after tens of millons in both the USA and Evrope can’t unlearn such beliefs? Fun times are over the horizon.

        You know, I don’t think we were prepared for the onslaught of executive action, perhaps nobody is prepared for the avalanche of lying, CYA, and outright exposures that might be headed our way.
I guess the very good news is that finally, the executive realizes he’s got the whole dirty system by the short and curlies. A blackmail nation has one great weakness, and that’s somebody spilling the beans…especially in the social media age.

        Yep, once a government and its media whores lose credibility, there’s no going back.  The COVID hysteria was probably the final straw, but I think it had been growing for a while prior to that if for nothing else all the pointless wars in the last 60y, the trillions spent on them, and the lies that our government and media told us that got us into those wars.  Reminds me of a saying the non-party Russians used to share among themselves in the latter stages of the Soviet Union:“они делают вид, что говорят нам правду, а мы делаем вид, что им верим”.They pretend to tell us the truth and we pretend to believe them.

        “To close the door on the past, you must revisit the body of lies that is the past.”
I dunno. If a System collapses Soviet-style, you can do this, because you have nothing to lose. But I cannot think of a System in modern times that conducted a successful reform involving a big inquiry into the past. Usually, fragile Systems cannot withstand this level of examination because the foundations of the System get challenged too hard. I agree that we need it but I wonder if we can stand it.

            Yes.Perestroikaandglasnost, to cite a recent example, were supposed to act as relief valves but took down the USSR. If anything, the radical equalitarianism/egalitarianism the GAE embraced and exported is a bigger lie than communism and will not withstand scrutiny.

        One thing I’ve always wondered about: why are there so many younger bald men? If you look at pictures from before the 2000s, most younger men had hair; enough to comb it. Now you walk around and I see a large minority of men with the skinhead look. Was it like this in the 80s? 70s?
I live near The Villages and I see better heads of hair on the old folks than I do on the heads of my coworkers.
I wish RFKJ would ask that question…

            The look was not fashionable in the 70’s/80’s. It is much harder to age a guy with no hair. If a guy is in their mid-30’s with already lost hair and it’s starting to salt and pepper, a younger look will be achieved by simply shaving it off.I suspect the chronically poor nutrition of the late 20th century is somewhat involved with the hair loss/early grey effect. (But only somewhat).

                I considered that balding guys in previous eras hid their bald spots with comb-overs. (My dad did. Sigh.) Now the skinhead look is much more accepted and fashionable.Both my brother and I went bald in our twenties. Quite a few of our acquaintances did too, and we’ve rarely made fun of bald guys…but I suspect that in times past every friend group had “the bald guy” (who was really just thinning) just like they had “the fat guy” (who was only 20 lbs overweight).My shampoo in my youth was Pert Plus. I blame that piece of mass-produced factory-made shit.

                    I have a friend who was extremely, extremely good looking, the sort of guy who walked in a bar and the women just flocked to. He was totally bald by the time he was 25 or so and just shaved it all off. I don’t think it was too much of a problem in his life, but I remember looking at him and just thinking that God giveth and God taketh away…

                I haven’t seen ridiculous pieces, or ridiculous comb-overs. In fact I haven’t seen many vain men…though I’ve seen mature ladies get tarted up. A lot of the geezers are pretty fit though, despite all the alcohol. I guess they’re not so worried about their hair as their physique.

                I’ve visited a couple times (not for orgies). They are attractive communities. Sumter County (one of those Villages is in) has/had the distinction of being America’s oldest county by average age. It is not without reason that smartasses sometimes dub parts of Florida “God’s Waiting Room.” Yet during the pandemic and using official mortality figures, it had a whopping 0.18% (of population) Covid-19 death rate in the first year of the Coviding.

            “why are there so many younger bald men?”My money is on sodium benzoate and other subliming preservatives.I did a 4-year stint as production manager of a place that used a lot of preservatives, and my hair thinned through that time, then stopped thinning when I left. The production staff who worked with the stuff all had severe hair loss, but for one hispanic guy. The company that manufactured the preservatives we used absolutely reeked of the stuff, even in the front office, and most of the guys there were balding or beyond. Other facilities that were high users of benzoate derivatives, same pattern.Look at the labels. It’s in pretty much everything.

        It was shocking how fast the Soviet Union fell. But the credibility of their system had been eroding for decades. It looks like we are going through something similar. Thank God enough Americans have finally got Street Smart.

            The confirmation hearings are revealing; it seems to be slowly dawning on the managerial class and their senate sock puppets that they’ve burned through all their credibility; panic and histrionics are a bit of a tell.
They’re coming off like a teacher who’s lost control of a class.

            Hyperinflation preceded the collapse. Somehow the historical narratives mostly skip over that part. They didn’t just have to lose trust in the managers, they had to lose it in the money too. Distrusted managers can remain in charge for a long time if the money is good.

        “Did the CIA sell drugs in the United States to fund covert operations?”
Yes. Nor is that all that “they” have done. And it has been copiously documented:

            I was going to say this after I read all the comments. Gladio ran on drug money in partnership with the Italian mafia and the Vatican Bank. I remember a book about Gladio had some CIA types being cool with heroin coming to the US because it would all go into the ghettos; white kids would never do it.That conspiracy theory that the CIA started the crack epidemic and smuggled from Central America to fund the Contras and themselves has pretty much proven true. The whole Vietnam/Laos war enriched CIA people and the agency itself too. Afghanistan did the same thing. Heroin dried up when we left there.

        The Russians went through this after the Cold War. There was a great reexamining of what had happened under communism.It actually had this phasepriorto the end of the Cold War.Perestroikaandglasnost, while limited in nature, were supposed to act as relief valves. Instead, the openness accelerated the end of the USSR. There were other reasons, of course, but this one looms large.This raises the question of whether an Empire of Lies can survive without total information control and a tightly curated media monopoly. Warren and Co. always were this idiotic, for example, but tight information control made it largely unknown not so long ago. The Covid Regime also collapsed for several reasons, including the stirring of revolt in the provinces, but even with the massive censorship the truth eventually seeped out. This type of repression founded on lies would be far more difficult today.I greatly underestimated the importance of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. The lesson to learn here is that if we ever attain an ethnostate that works in our interest, or, as is more likely, carve out enclaves probably out of necessity, it will be very important to have effective propaganda and control over information. That’s where the power lies and stability becomes possible.

            Perestroika and glasnost, while limited in nature, were supposed to act as relief valves. Instead, the openness accelerated the end of the USSR. There were other reasons, of course, but this one looms large.It’s like the USSR tried an uncontrolled limited hangout (shock therapy). A ULH is an oxymoron. A limited hangout has to be tightly controlled to work in the minds of the low-information general public. When one sloppily-constructed limited hangout after another are piled up too deep too fast in a Fabian regime you have a ULH which slides into a Thermidorian reaction and a panic among the hysterics. People have memories.This raises the question of whether an Empire of Lies can survive without total information control and a tightly curated media monopoly.The statement answers itself, an Empire of Lies cannot survive without total information control and a tightly curated media monopoly. But maybe a Democracy of Lies can? I don’t think we can go back to Our DemocracyTM however.

                    It’s easy to forget that the elite are at least as racist as any of us. They don’t even regard Africans or most other third worlders as human. They see them more like rats or insects. Some times it may be politically useful to let such creatures breed out of control. If your plan is also to invite millions of them into Europe or North America, you get the added “advantage” of undermining western wages, living standards, and expectations in general.The anti-natal attitude towards Whites is the real agenda. A lot of the African soap opera is just meant to give the remaining White striver cucks something to feel good about that differentiates them from the Deplorable Whites. Once the Whites have mostly died off or been reduced to penury, the ruling class can casually wipe out the Africans at leisure. Hell, you don’t even need to actively kill them, just stop delivering food aid and let nature take its course.

I move  we take a lesson from Mandela’s SA “Truth and Reconciliation Commissions”.  Let all those who wronged us *confess* and if truthful, receive pardons for their transgressions. Let those believing they were wronged testify as to those wrongs. Let the victims apply for compensation—if possible.
If nothing else, it will be a better show than what we get from Congress now.
