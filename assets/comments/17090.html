        I have never been to France and have seen Notre Dame cathedral only in photos and films.  I am not Catholic.  Yet my initial reaction was shock, then real grief at such a loss and then real anger.  And the anger was directed immediately at muslims because this disaster is something that muslims do:  destroy the symbols of the civilization they intend to conquer.  Muslims murder people in the present and murder the foundations of their hated kafirs’ culture.  Z has it right about this.  My first thought was that some muslim(s) set the fire deliberately and my second thought when I learned that renovations are being done on the cathedral was that some muslim worker of about IQ 80 did something stupid and set the fire inadvertently.The reaction of the propaganda mill is exactly as expected.  It wouldn’t matter if Mustafa stood on the steps of the cathedral with gas can and torch in hand while shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ the propaganda mill will do its utmost to tamp down any mention of islamic terror.  And maybe it wasn’t islamic terror.  But the point is that the assumption that it WAS islamic terror will be occurring to millions of us and 30 years ago that thought would never have entered our heads.

            This shock-grief-anger progression is of the similar kind that I felt when I read about that poor boy in Minnesota who was thrown off the balcony by a diverse individual.

                I read in newspeak that that the effing A**hole vibrant was mad because after wandering through the mall hitting on white women to get laid (great line, Dude), he failed, got pissed, decided to kill a white person, again wandered through the mall the next day and didn’t find the right white person to kill, until the following day he found the little boy to kill and hurl into the void. Now you can get laid, right?! Not the first story heard about vibrant on the white nookie prowl to get laid, failed, then killed.

            Pretty much the same here.Never been to France, never seen the cathedral except in photographs. And I’m not Catholic.My initial reaction was the same:  shock.  My thought was:  I bet some Muslim burnt the thing.Then I started seeing the stories pop out about how many churches have been burnt in France, and I also saw a blog post indicating that the people working on these structures are HIGHLY trained – and had left work at 6:00.  Then the fires started around 6:30 – and started in two places.Seeing as how so many churches in France have burned already – I’m thinking that Occam’s Razor applies here.

The more crucial assumption that millions of us should make is that It was Jewish perfidy that led to Islamic terror in White countries.

        I’ll quote Mike Vanderboegh–a bit of a nutcase, but a keen observer of many things:“Because let me tell you something about white folks at their worst. When they get scared that people are trying to kill them just because of who they are, when they get pissed off along racial lines, they don’t tear up their own neighborhoods or burn down their own communities like y’all do. They come to the neighborhoods of the people who threaten them and burn THEIR communities down and kill THEM. They have burned down whole CONTINENTS. And if you don’t believe me, just ask the Indians.”

            I don’t think we see that kind of violence. Instead, I think we start seeing civil disobedience. Employees of “woke” companies will start sabotaging their own firms. White voters will start supporting increasingly radical candidates. Whites will start becoming more open about race issues and become more anti-Semitic. Ten years ago, I did not think antisemitism would ever get a purchase in America. Today, think it is inevitable.
I said in the run up to the 2016 election that Trump was the olive branch. It’s looking that way.

                In the near term you are right.  But Mike’s point was, “we’re nice until we’re not” and won’t engage in a bunch of useless  LARP’ing.  Or as you put it, once the circuit closes…

                    Most nations treat violence like a dial, you turn it up a bit, you turn it down a bit. Most people of the Northern European Nations and their descendants tend to have two settings – ‘off’ and ‘kill everybody’. Except for the odd case of the Irish.

                Yes to this. Simple, secret, solo, and spontaneous. The jackboots will follow their orders and target the openly militia-minded first. And the persecutions will escalate. The road to victory over a tyrannical government is not a mob. It’s the invisible shiv.

                I’ve been job hunting on and off the last year or so. I’m looking for something in software. A lot of the companies around here are startups of the most pozziest poz sort you can imagine. You’ll go to the company website and they’ve got a photo gallery of their collection of tattooed purple haired weirdo employees including a few obvious trannies. This is Portland, OR, the heart of darkness, in other words. I’m too old, white, cleancut and cop-looking to pull off the kind of clown show they would want to see in the interview. If I was younger and could fake being more of the hipster type I might seriously look at working in one of these circuses. Then I would go in everyday thinking “How can I hurt these people today?”

                    Clown World is so bad these days that I’m not sure you have to do much.I have a close friend who works for a  huge industrial firm name redacted  and oh boy, the stories he tells me.If I was in the B street trying to destroy that company by ridding it  of capable personal and creating a worst than bad reputation I couldn’t do better than simple stupidityThere are a lot of companies like this out there , most of them arguably and when the US stops being the reserve currency and the economy goes tits up,  the Left is going to go even more bonkers and all hell will break loose.

                        I spent a couple of decades in tech and by the end was convinced that the secret to success for tech companies was having the right business model and not being as screwed up as the competition. None of them were competently run. At best they had one or two key divisions that could achieve at least mediocrity while the rest functioned like Soviet bureaucracies.
Reminds me of the rule that the best way to improve your looks is to hang around ugly people

                            Once working on one of many project with IBM had to finally sit the project lead down and give him a “ration” of  people he was permitted to bring to meetings.  Design and spec sessions had turned into clusterfucks where every peripherally involved person would show up to get “client contact points” (yes this was a thing) for their performance appraisals.  Usually these were VP or SVP level people who would constantly derail any progress with pointless, uninformed opinions.  It was easy to figure out how they managed to fuck up the commercialization of the genuinely amazing stuff that came out of the R&amp;D labs.

                Leading up to the 2016 election, I noticed the ((())) references and a degree of criticism of Jews on various blogs and websites  that I had not read before.  Many websites restrict or prohibit commenting at all now.

            I just don’t believe in that. Even within specific ethnicities there are tremendous variables. The Greek Regiments from Crete were absolute warriors but the Cyprus Regiment just weren’t.It’s a comforting thought but I fear we’re more like Afrikaners, not especially capable of coherent resistance without it being state sponsored. Just being white doesn’t cut it. The reactions are either nothing or supremely wicked retardation by lone nut jobs like Roof or the guy who shot up the Tree of Life Synagogue.Alternatively when groups like the Proud Boys actually mount effective and sensible actions, they get thrown under the bus by everybody. It’s why I hate the phrase no enemies to the right because it translates to “no ones more right than me therefore I’m allowed to hit everybody and they’re not allowed to hit back.”

                I hear the talk about “nice until we’re not”, but no one ever gives examples.  I suppose you could point at the world wars, but that was a different time with different people.  Some of those soldiers were in lynch mobs for certain individuals who were too friendly to their daughters.  What have we done recently?That said, if we ever tried to organize ourselves for defense, it would likely be run as well as your local businesses.  Better than a mob, but we’re not going to get too much done (Malheur OR anyone?).I say this so we can organize effectively instead of feeling like we can flip a switch one day and go into God-mode.

                    The question is also whether a fellow wants to actually win or a fellow just wants a race war or something. There are men who would rather lose as long as they got to shoot at people. Plus nobody is really willing to define what we they want and why, not really.And here’s the kicker, I really don’t think anybody realizes how race is just about the thinnest bond of loyalty you can have in practice. I know some people reading this have already switched off and are running CivNatHate.exe, but I haven’t actually said anything civic nationalist yet. If America was 100% white tomorrow, you’d still have the same Anglo Saxon civil war going on that has been going on since the original English Civil War at least if not earlier (I think Moldbug got that basically right). If defining your parameters as ethnostate equals solving the problem, I don’t think that solves the problem.

                        I agree.  I know zero people who will feel loyalty based on race… who are white.  I’m under the impression that blacks have a rather monolithic culture, while whites have lots of semi-recognized, semi-compatible subcultures, and the Spanish easily congregate/segregate into where they or their parents are from.  Whites can’t unite in the US for the same reason whites in Europe can’t.I think this guy (https://aidanmaclear.wordpress.com/2019/03/03/nationalism/) made a good point that people can be truly loyal to local people who are similar to them so a “nation” is way too abstract.We are still so steeped in the poz that we couldn’t think of an alternative if our lives depended on it (heh).It would be a fun experiment to remove all the progressive influences on us and see how we organize ourselves.  Start with “Equality is not a virtue or a fact” and see what kind of Europe/America develops.

                            Even among black people they absolutely see distinctions between themselves as well; Africans don’t count for some (kind of like the differences between American Anglo Saxons and Englishmen) and West Indians are better but still “different”. In Houston, Frenchtown was the home of mixed raced blacks from Louisiana, they didn’t want to live among what they viewed as “low class” locals (who also didn’t care for the “snobby” Louisianans).

                                I didn’t know that about Houston.  I’m curious how much it’s still like that.  I think recent African immigration might create new groups, like the Somalis.The reason I’m a little skeptical is that, though I’m not a traveler, I’m also skeptical that the eleven American nations are as distinct as they used to be.I grew up on the east coast in a very liberal area.  You could see a distinct difference between the (rather conservative and white) people who had family that’d been there for generations and the numerically superior (liberal and white) people who’d moved in for a job, even if it was three decades ago.  Nothing new, I know, but I think one in three people live in a different state than where they grew up.  I can’t find that stat, so maybe it’s false, but if true, how can distinct cultures continue?I suppose America appears to be in a very weak position of transition.  It used to be made of distinct groups who were either from different countries or at least enemy groups from the same country (like cavaliers and roundheads who became Confederate and Union).  Now we’re moving and mixing a great deal, under an all-powerful, universal media/university/education system.  But we’re not yet all mixed or unified to the degree of Scotland or Estonia.I guess part of why white people are so disorganized is that we’re not (yet?) one people with one culture, but also are losing our distinct groups we used to belong to.

                        Hoyos says: “race is just about the thinnest bond of loyalty…”Except for every major war, genocide, and mass migration in human history and pre-history.  You may have heard of the last race war, where the Caucasian US fought off the invasion of the Oriental Japanese empire; maybe reconsider how race played a role in that conflict, how the Nipponese raped and massacred their Han, Caucasian, and Korean racial enemies on an explicitly racial basis, then rethink what you said.

                            Except the Koreans are the same race as the Japanese, they are genetically indistinct. It’s why Koreans have been “passing” as Japanese whenever they can get away with it. The Japanese didn’t care about “race” it was the Japanese nation. Their racial first cousins were all one to them, it was Japanese or not Japanese.

The future is unpredictable so if order breaks down we must align ourselves with what is most trustworthy.
Hoyos, in a time of upheaval  and limited information, what group would you choose:
• Same race but all other factors very dissimilar• Same religion or politics or lack but all other factors very dissimilar• Same social class or IQ but all other factors very dissimilar• The people who live within a 5 mile radius of you

        An 870 year-old cathedral, taking over 200 years to build, using countless wood fires to keep the workers warm, millions of candles over the centuries–and no major fires. Yet, in 2019, this magnificent symbol of Western Civilization and Christianity (not “Judeo-Christian at all) burns down because of “some construction materials”?And as the fires consumed the cathedral–fires that apparently ‘started’ in two separate places–French officials rushed to assure the sheeple that arson (and terrorism) was already ruled out.How comforting.I do not believe in coincidences. Not in today’s world. Not when TWELVE CHURCHES in France in recent weeks have been vandalized, some proven to be by Muslims, and there’s no pattern other than the presence of a hostile Islam to explain the lack of vandalism BEFORE Islam gained entry to France.This is an “Aloha Snackbar” moment–not that the French cuck officials would ever admit it to be so.“When blacks riot, cities burn. When whites riot, continents burn.”

        The problem with many if not most Europeans is that they’re wholly unworthy of the architecture around them, built by long dead people.  Everything can be rebuilt, including churches, but cultures take a dozen generations to be rebuilt.  So much has been lost in the last half century (actually, the last century).  I find the burning of Notre Dame to be a metaphor of French faith, which never recovered that much after the revolution.  As a matter of fact, the crisis of European and American civilization is a crisis of faith.I really doubt that the average Frenchman, who only walks into churches for funerals, is that stirred by this.  He should be.  As an American who steps into Europe, I feel the cheapness of our own architecture, the cinderblock Walmarts and Home Depots, the cold glass office buildings, almost purely driven by balance sheets and utilitarianism.  But then as I walk around, I see the same “People of Walmart” only not as fat, most of them anyway.   If you don’t have faith you can’t have pride in anything, whether architecture, good government,  or even your own dignity.  It’s only when we’ve lost nearly everything that we’ll understand this as a people.

Then you don’t know many average Frenchmen. Unlike Anglos, the French are immensely proud of their culture and their history.
The Frogs you see pontificate in the international media, are cut from the same cloth as American MSM prostitutes, they’re not French, they’re globalists first, Parisians second, homosexuals third, and so forth, and somewhere way down the list, yes, I suppose they’ve got a dash of French blood in them.

The Booby hopes you’re right, he truly does. But if popular culture and the “normies” as you call them can’t muster an iota of outrage for an ABC executive who was glad for the Las Vegas mass-shooting because country music fans are Republicans, then the Booby is skeptical that they will care one iota over the burning of a building.
If this ignites some pride and love for Western Civilization then great, but let’s hope it’s not just another symbol of how irretrievably deep we’ve sunk.

                    I wonder about the red-pilling on this one.  I suspect quite a few people are upset by this in the same way they are upset when an old mansion or music hall burns down.  It is a sad thing and a passing of an old and unique thing, but replacing it with, say, a peace pole, is just sort of how things go.  9/11 was a much more viscerally painful experience because the people who lost their lives were mostly average Joes and Janes, and the bad guys were “in your face” about it. My fear is that this one just further toughens people up to continue to take more and more abuse without flinching, rather than getting rightfully deep-down angry about it.

                        There’s no magic bullet. Lots of people reacted to 9/11 by falling for the invade the word/religion of peace stuff, while waving the flag, thinking it was the right response. Lots of people woke up to the reality of Islam. Still others woke up to the reality of immigration. The fact is, 9/11 set a lot of people off on a path to somewhere that really did not exist at the time. The closest thing was paleo-conservatism, which was just civic nationalism plus some race realism.Today, the dissident right is a much better defined thing with more complete arguments. That means that white guy who is wondering what’s happening has a lot of options that did not exist 20 years ago.

                            Could be, but I have my own doubts.  Christianity has been “othered” in our culture now, so this incident is a tragedy, but not a source of deep anger for many.  It is high time that Christians come to terms with the idea that our broader culture has no place for true Christianity, openly practiced. The broader culture prefers the Christmas-Easter pastiche, all mixed up with Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.  The churches and cathedrals are considered some sort of Disneyland exhibits, even by some Christians.  True Christianity is now a subversive movement in our popular culture, and Christians are not allowed to have nice things.  That is OK, because being a Christian is about faithfulness, not nice things.  But I am afraid the rest of the culture may just treat the whole Notre Dame episode as a price to be paid for how things are now, rather than as a source of deep anger, as 9/11 was for so many.  Perhaps this is just a personal sort of black pill showing.

            They don’t use the correct phrase “Abrahamic”, because a lot of the Right is pacified by rube bait against Muslims. Using this phrase in regular conversation would expose the marginalization of Christianity, so instead they used a contrived phrase with no history other than Zionist partisanship.

                I like the “Abrahamic” approach – it lets Christianity stand on its own feet again. I’ve always been leery of the idea that Christianity is the Jewish junior varsity. I became Catholic in part because Chrisitian Zionism has utterly converged American Protestantism.

        In real time we saw Muslims/Blacks celebrating. That image will be hard to push out of people’s minds.
Ben Shapiro embarrassed himself again, a replay of the cringe from the March for Life in January. His credibility is reaching Dinesh-levels, and his target audience of Millennials are less pliable than aged Boomers.
Whenever someone uses “Judeo-Christian” replay with “Abrahamic”. We should strive for being equidistant towards Jews and Muslims. Good luck to the classical liberals trying to shoehorn Islam as a part of “Western values”, regaling us about the tolerant Al-Andalus and Ottoman Empire.

                    Viewing Christ as merely a prophet is plenty heretical. Christ is the messiah and the savior. Mohammed’s failure to acknowledge that identifies him as a false prophet and Islam as a false religion.
It doesn’t even make sense. How can Jesus be a prophet of Islam when he says things that directly conflict with Islam? Islam is a religion for people whose brains have been baked in the sun too long.

Billions of dollars being pledged to rebuild it. It’ll never be rebuilt. They don’t have the will and the graft will just siphon off all that money. And personally I don’t want them to rebuild it because I know they will just be building a mosque

And that’s precisely what it should NOT be.  It was a Catholic church, and as a Catholic church it should be rebuilt.  And if that’s what the plan is, and the actuality shows it congruent to the plan, I will cheerfully donate to that.

            Leaving it half destroyed like the “peace shrine” in Hiroshima just might be the most fitting end.  Rebuilding it invites more attacks, while leaving it as-is somehow makes it a “sacred space”.  If the Catholic Church was not such a pedo-cuckfest at the top, I might feel differently.  France and Western Europe, given their priorities, own this thing, one way or another.
Ironic that the Louis Vitton and Gucci billionaires are behind the rebuilding, as they are front and center in reaping the benefits of the cultural destruction of their country over the last few decades.

        That cathedral was the primal roar of a people celebrating their creator…Is. Is the primal roar.Not to downplay the incident, but Notre Dame is still standing. The cathedrals were built for eternity and the anonymous master masons who designed them, knew that buildings caught fire from time to time and built accordingly. The greatest loss was the artwork inside and the Rose Window.We Euros don’t like to talk about this, but the great cathedrals are patchworks of additions, rebuilds and restaurations, so when the tour guide points to some great, magnificent building and tells you it’s 12th C., he’s most likely only talking about the load-bearing columns, maybe part of the apsis and two of the walls. The rest of it is from later periods; the spire on the Notre Dame was an 18th C. addition.An absolutely riveting docu about how to build a Gothic cathedral:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h57bqssrAMs

        Whether it was accidental or deliberate is the hot topic across the blogosphere. I was called a “conspiracy theorist” for suggesting the Religion of Peace (who have targeted Notre Dame before) might have something to do with it.Z’s take is absolutely spot on,bless you,man. Watching that exquisite cathedral burn,at the start of Holy Week no less. Those pictures of the spire dissolving in flames was iconic,like watching Western Civilization collapse before our eyes.The sight of young Parisians on their knees in prayer as it burned,belies the notion that France is totally secular now.We will learn much from the reactions of the left and right,and all in between in the days ahead. Plan accordingly. Give thanks there are sane men among us with clear vision.

        A couple of weeks ago I read Walter Kempowski’s 2006 novel called (in English) ‘All For Nothing.’ It’s about the last days of East Prussia, in January 1945. People – I mean normal people, went about their business, nervous – as we are – about some dark wind blowing toward them, some looming nightmare, but like us they lived in a fog as to the actual situation (their rulers like ours prohibited all negative talk and accurate information), and when the time came to flee, it was too late. Eight hundred years of German civilization was about to die – instantly – and the reaction to all this was numbed incomprehension among people whose instincts for survival had been erased by a totalitarian government.I could have read this book just ten years ago and thought, “must have sucked to be German in 1945”. Now? I’m beginning to wonder of I am not sort of an East Prussian myself, seeing the glow and hearing the dull roar of Soviet artillery on the horizon, yet still thinking, gosh, how bad can it really be?

            Part of the problem was that they were so used to Goebbels lying to them, they didn’t believe the atrocity stories. They just wanted the war to be over, and hell, how bad could the Soviets be?
Bad, as it turned out.

            This is a good analogy.
I keep asking myself “how can we organize any sort of resistance once enough of the population figures out what is going on?”  I keep not having a good answer to that question.

                It is not about people figuring it out.  A lot of them sort of know, but they are comfortable under the blue pill, and will seize the plausible “safe” explanation (construction accident, in this case).  The duskies have learned this, and go for anonymous sabotage rather than the big 9/11 style gestures.

        I commented on another, slightly more mainstream, blog that “Maybe if it’s terrorism, it will be a good thing? Maybe it will get the attention of the French and other Europeans that they have to stop the invasion?” and I was met with a chorus – including the blog author – that I was a bad person because I was wanting it to be terrorism and “wishing for the worst” and “after all, the French aren’t really Christian anymore either, and that started long before the muslims showed up.”Technically he’s right, but maybe in shedding more light on the invaders the Europeans might take incidents like this to rediscover their heritage? I don’t understand why it can’t be both to so many people and why they don’t see that all of these issues are interrelated?Get rid of the muslims, quit preaching the gospel of multiculturalism, start preaching the gospel of your own people and your own customs, and plant a seed. Maybe something like this COULD lead to a restoration if so many people weren’t intent on it not.

        For my daily Scripture reading yesterday, the Gospel was Mt 21:18-22. The morning after he cleanses the Temple, Jesus comes upon a fig tree, and when he finds no fruit on it, he says “May no fruit ever come from you again.”I recalled this curse many times yesterday as Notre Dame burned. The people of Israel gave us the Patriarchs, Moses, the Prophets, the Blessed Mother, and of course Our Lord himself, but since AD 30 or so they have contributed exactly nothing of worth to civilization. They are a barren tree. All they seem to be able to do is attach themselves like lampreys to one rulling class after another and use their proximity to power to enrich themselves and gain privileged status.And when the fruit of an actual civilization burns–something they could never dream of creating themselves–they can’t contain their glee.It was built with money stolen from Jews!they cry. (Even if this is true, what would they have done with the money? I think we know.)It had anti-Semitic artwork, they wail. (And perhaps our forefathers were wiser than we.)What are we to conclude?

                You are a dope.Well, I’ll happily plead guilty to that, and I admit that I allowed my rhetoric to get in the way of precision, so thanks for allowing me the opportunity to clarify.There’s no doubt that Jews, residing as aliens in civilizations built by others, have made numerous technical advances, some of which have been enormously beneficial. Others (many, many others) not so much.But Jonas Salk et al were standing on the shoulders of giants. Christian men, acting self-consciouslyasChristian men, built the philosophical, artistic, and architectural foundations of European civilization, including the scientific method, without which Jonas Salk would have discovered nothing.What of lasting civilizational value have post-Temple Jews, actingasJews, built?

        Sunday was Palm Sunday, the first day of Holy Week, so all of the churches would have been full, people would have dressed up a bit and paraded about town a bit more than usual with their palm branches in hand.
After this very public display of European heritage I’m sure the darkie invaders weren’t at all rustled and it was purely an accident that couldn’t have been avoided.

            When I heard about this my first thought was – it’s near Easter, France is full of Muslims, yellow vest unrest still going on and probably keeping the authorities distracted, gotta be terrorism. Now of course this was based on no evidence whatsoever. An article on Foxnews.com (https://www.foxnews.com/world/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-being-investigated-as-accident-for-now-prosecutors-say) today says “Paris police will investigate the disaster as ‘involuntary destruction caused by fire’ and have ruled out arson and potential terror-related motives for starting the blaze, officials said.”. Last night though they were talking on the news about how difficult it was to get to the spot they think the blaze started. There’s only this one narrow, ancient stairwell going up there. The site in question is now presumably destroyed too. How do you rule out anything so soon given that any evidence one way or another is probably still a smoldering pile of debris? Of course it still might turn out to be an accident but this kind of thing always makes me think “the lady doth protest too much”.

                Unrelated story. My brother is a rural doc and coroner for the rural county, and as such he is friends with the local emergency personnel. The fire Marshal (or what ever the hell they’re called) told him that if a rednecks guns burned up in a house fire it was guaranteed to NOT be arson. If, however, the guns were safe, it might be arson, or it might be that they got the guns out of the house before the family pictures.

        Despite being a skeptic all the time, I’m still always amazed at how hopeful most people are so that they buy the lamest stories about events put out within minutes of whatever is unfolding because I assume they don’t want to stare at the hard truth.  I own and restored three properties that are very old.  Two of them are on the National Registry.  The extreme care one goes through to avoid a restoration/construction fire is, well, extreme.  And then I read that the cathedral had a spinkler system–for a building to burn with a sprinkler system–well it might be a one in a million occurance, but my bet is it took planning.  To quickly and causally say this is a construction fire–on that monument–is stupid.  The coverup started within minutes of the call to the fire fighters.  I feel sorry for the real French people.  They are betrayed by their leaders.  And we are too.

        What has our heritage bequeathed us? We are hearty, resilient, multi-talented, reticent, and innovative. That is a formidable skill set. It just needs to be rousted from the recesses of evolutionary memory and break through the crust of what affluent life has burdened us with. The time is getting near. Watch the Yellow Vests. My guess is that they will go hot soon. Vive la Notre Dame.

        Writing as a Zionist Jew… BEN SHAPIRO IS A PUTZ FOR SAYING THAT.  (For those non-Yiddish speakers, “putz” is not a compliment.)
Here’s my reaction:

I know there are some people who dislike Jews on this site.  OK, that’s your prerogative.  I stand with America, with Western Civilization, and with whites to oppose the Great Replacement and the Islamization of the world.  Don’t like my kippa?  Let’s duke it out after we’ve handled bigger threats.

        “Even if the cause was recklessness by some workers, that’s probably worse. Like America, this kind of work in Paris is done by foreigners now. The work crews are no doubt Algerians, Tunisians and maybe some Africans. The few French involved spend their time keeping these tribes from murdering one another.”Do you have any actual evidence to support this claim Z-man? If we accuse the main stream media of believing anything that happens to support their narrative (the Covington boys and Smollet cases and of course the whole Russia conspiracy nonsense being the most blatant examples of this in recent times) maybe we ourselves should follow a bit higher standards and not just make shit up.I watched a documentary about restoring the medieval Rosslyn Chapel in Britain, and it sure seems that this kind of work is done by highly skilled local craftsmen and not by some semi-retarded third worlders. This is probably the case also in France. After all, if you tasked some 80 IQ Arabs or Africans with restoring a medieval church, the result probably wouldn’t resemble anything like the original.Just like with the last post about the falling IQ of Western countries, I don’t doubt the overall thesis that as the size of the dumb fraction in society increases compared to the smart fraction things just start falling apart even if no one is intentionally trying to sabotage them. But just like lack of moon flights and supersonic passenger jets are bad examples of this (because there are much simpler and more immediate explanations for the lack of these things), so is the Notre Dame restoration work, because it’s highly unlikely that the workers were some low skilled third worlders.Here’s the documentary, fascinating stuff:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxdPUXJfV8Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lh_sBhQsFohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU7Xbm1aWkUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KOahKse5dE

            Yes.
Also, the idea that Macron would have any influence on how to restore the  church, is preposterous. He doesn’t advise the Louvre on how to restore the Mona Lisa either.
In this case, I put my trust entirely in the muscular French bureaucracy.

            Calling people Nazis is sooo two years ago. Didn’t you get the memo? We don’t care anymore. As you have aptly demonstrated, “Nazi” and “anti-Semite” just mean “Someone who said something Jews don’t like.” Shapiro is getting exactly the criticism he deserves.
And if Jews are so bummed about the end of Western Civilization, maybe it would be a good idea for them to stop hurrying it along with mass immigration, corruption of traditional values and hate campaigns against Whites.
If they stopped all that crap, then maybe we could talk. Maybe. It’s hard to forget.

                Jews I know/follow, even some popular media type, are as conservative as the day is long.  No, they have not reached the level of this group—but how many have?  For example, a repeated topic of discussion by some like Dennis Prager is “Why are Jews so liberal?”   Never heard a good answer to that, but the question is the same posed as here, albeit in different formulations.It may make for better/concise argument to generalize wrt broad swathes of folk under the rubric of “them and us”.  I’ll leave that up to Z-man.  But I don’t see the benefit of excluding such fellow travelers at this point in our formation.  However, I am legitimately open to discussion on this.

                    How can you tell? Are you going to make the good jews wear a star? This is the beginning of magic soil theory,  that anybody who shares our values is us and should be accepted. They aren’t and shouldn’t.  They can go be good conservatives in israel.

                    Although I wouldn’t rule out short term tactical alliances, a powerful argument against allowing many J3ws into a group or country is that many of them always feel vulnerable as a minority, make open borders one of their highest priorities, and devote their considerable skills to that end.  Their need to dissolve the homogeneity of their host countries is constant over time and apparently cannot be mitigated.

                    They’re not liberal, they’re just faithful democrat voters. They’re faithful democrat voters because they want to vote for the anti-white party. Unless the dissident right pick up the cause of being anti-white they aren’t gaining Jewish votes.
It’s the same reason courting black voters with promises of economic prosperity continues to be a massive failure. Black voters aren’t looking for economic prosperity primarily, they’re looking to fight white people.

            NAJALT, but there is a large plurality of Jews, particularly in America (and particularly well-placed in The Cathedral) whose primary identity is anti-Christian.  Read Michael Medved’s section of the Commentary forum from years back on why Jews vote Left.  He caught Hell for that from fellow tribesmen.  I know Jews who defy the stereotype, but they have little voice in their community.  Unless and until they rip the megaphone away from guys like Shapiro, you can keep calling me “Nazi.”

            No one cares.I think there is a resurgence of anti-Semitism because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural. And I thinkwe are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies they once were in the last century.Jews are going to be at the centre of that. It’s a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode andJews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.– Barbara Lerner SpectreGosh, how did all these Mohammedan savages end up in Europe, where they can burn and defile Christian churches? Who could possibly advocate for such a destructive and short-sighted policy? I guess it’ll forever remain a mystery.

                I don’t know anything about Shapiro ‘cept what I read on this blog and — because I was curious to see other reactions — typing “ben shapiro” into Twitter search about half an hour ago. That’s when I saw the apology. It makes no sense to react to a maladroit tweet without also taking the apology into consideration. Would you characterize that as desperation?

Askkenazi Jews are mostly European stock but Jewish thinking and Jewish ethics are Middle Eastern not of the West
Things of the West matter nothing to them since they mostly lived in their own communities and have unwilling to assimilate for fear of losing their identity

                Some people close to me believe that Shapiro is our single, best chance to persuade normal Americans of all races to embrace conservatism and transcend racial strife.
When these people hear the ideas discussed on this site they dismiss them out of hand as repugnant to normal Americans and therefore doomed.  To them, Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens, and Dennis Prager are our best hope.
I used to agree with them until I became convinced that tribalism is more powerful than shared values.

                    It is remarkable. It’s like a cult in many ways. The cult of nice, as John Derbyshire put it years ago. These people have so internalized anti-racism as the highest moral good, they are seemingly immune to counter arguments. That said, they are not completely lost. The key is to just focus on friends and family. They can’t dismiss you as immoral. When they see someone they trust rejecting those CivNat ideas, they question the morality that holds them to those ideas.

                        That’s the problem with them: anti-racism as the highest moral good.  I follow all of them on twitter, and honestly I agree with their tweets at least 75% of the time.  But it’s that key issue, their preaching of color-blindness and not being racist, that leads their many good, patriotic followers down the wrong path.  That makes them in some ways, worse for us than the wacky left.  Their followers should be on our side.

                        Whites have been convinced that the traditional values for women of being compassionate and nurturing should be the dominant values of the society.
At the same time the traditional male values and behavior that built and defended the societies are deemed toxic. Plus, as the societies adopt compassion and nurturing as their dominant values, the women become less compassionate and nurturing as individuals

                        Prager was instrumental in making me a conservative in the 2000s.  I had to stop listening because he would imply that the average Hispanic illegal worker was as least as good a person as the average American and thus deserved some kind of amnesty.  Even if I granted him his belief about the relative worth of Hispanics versus Americans, I just couldn’t tolerate his promotion of amnesty based on meritocracy or compassion because I didn’t want my country to become Latin America.

                                Z-man red-pilled me on Prager in the podcast where he read Prager’s piece on being a Jew in America.  I listened to Prager’s radio show for years after 9/11 but he never revealed his Jewish paranoia and alienation so openly there.  Pretty sure I’m more counter-Semitic than Z himself at this point.

                                        I can’t cite specific broadcasts, but during the Bush amnesty wars in the mid 2000s, when he argued with someone who was against amnesty, Prager would often say something like, “When I am around Hispanic work crews, I feel entirely safe.  I would have no worries about my wife being alone with these men.”  He would also extol their work ethic, in implicit comparison to Americans.  He would usually imply that the real problem was the hard-heartedness of people on my side.

            Shapiro is fundamentally insincere. He’s an Orthodox Jew with a largely Christian following. But yet he doesn’t feel the slightest pull to do the right thing and convert.
He clearly identifies with Israel more than he does with anything Western except for perhaps “classical liberalism”, or the ability to make as much money as possible. So why doesn’t he move to Israel, well, he likes making money and didn’t want to serve in the IDF.

If a Liberal or Cuck screws up its memory holed. BTW, is Monica Fields doing OK with one arm?

            “Oops, my timing was off!” is not an apology. It’s an involuntary flinching in the face of unexpected backlash.It’s the same as the infamous memo from Jo Moore, a British government apparatchik, who wrote “It’s now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury,” as the Twin Towers were collapsing.  Mark Steyn wrote about her:“When the memo came to light, Ms Moore apologized, sort of. But it’s one of those political apologies, whereby one is obliged to distance oneself from an unintended self-revelation. September 11th was an unspun world; within 48 hours, we’d adjusted to the new reality and were expressing ourselves accordingly, but for a few hours that Tuesday what we said and did as we saw office workers jump to their deaths offered a glimpse of who we really are and how we really think. How callous do you have to be to watch the twin towers collapse and think Ms Moore’s thoughts, never mind put it in writing, happily append your name to it and send it to hundreds of people? No apology can ever take it back: we know her now.”And that’s true of Ben Shapiro now. I wonder if he was as carefree when the Bamayan Buddhas were being blown up?Would he chuckle heartily at the jokes the Romans told when the Temple in Jerusalem was being levelled? Who watches the destruction of one of the greatest churches in Christendom, a survivor through revolution and world wars, and immediately thinks of a cheap joke at Trump’s expense?No apology can ever take it back: we know him now.

            Apologies by public figures are worthless. Always assume they meant what they said. If Shapiro was half as smart or as supportive of the Christian part of “Judeo-Christian” as he wants us to believe, he would have known better. His TDS and his mean spirit were on display for everyone to see. Apology not accepted. This one demands a duel.

            Shapiro also didn’t really apologize.  He admitted a tactical error with his “wrong time, obviously”.  As is, the wound is too raw currently.  But he did not apologize for the substance.  Also, he wrote “apologies all”, which first of all is kind of feminine, and but more importantly is in the passive voice mistakes-were-made vein.I disagree with Vox Day on alot of things, but one thing he gets absolutely right is the ridiculousness of the term “Judeo-Christian”.  It’s a rhetorical slight of hand, and makes no more sense than “Muslim-Christian” or “Buddhist-Christian” when closely examined.Vox has written that Jews and Judasim are not of the West.  Not really.  They are Levantine.  Middle-Eastern.  With all the baked in hostility/insularity/arrogance of Middle Eastern peoples.  I’ve come round to thinking that he’s right.Remember that Shapiro has a backup country, run by and for his co-ethnics and co-religionists.  It’s Ethnostate for the Chosen, and Proposition-Nation for the Goy.Just like Judeo-Christ said.
