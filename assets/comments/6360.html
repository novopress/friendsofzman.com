        Progressives and neocons both imagine themselves brave souls battling the vested interests. But they are not only not fighting the vested interests (the so-called 1 percent); they aren’t even fighting each other, except over the division of the spoils.Neither are they the old Yankee elite, which has simply withdrawn to its estates, spending its days counting its money and hiring people to make more for them. Boston Brahmin types have no need of political avatars, because they know they’ll win either way, whichever pseudo-faction has the upper hand.Today’s actual elite is something quite else. It consists of a huge congregation of self-identified minorities and rejects, imagining they are battling prejudice when actually all the prejudice in the media, government, and social standards favorsthem. Members of these various groups don’t necessarily like or support each other, but some intuitive wisdom whispers “e pluribus unum!” in their ears — persecuted identitarians as a whole make an apparently unstoppable machine. They all get paid off. God help the poor white person who can’t claim outsider/professional victim status and can only look forward to being milked and genocided.

        re:  “the two sides of the old Yankee elite.”  The late leftist thinker Carl Oglesby made a different distinction in his “Yankee/Cowboy War” thesis.  Although I don’t agree with much of his final conclusion, his analysis of the deep politics in the American System argued that both parties were dominated by different groupings of large moneyed interests, which were in conflict with one another: the Democrats were the seat of banking and finance power centered in the Northeast (Yankees), while the Republicans had become the seat of oil and defense interests centered in the Southwest (Cowboys).  With the end of the Cold War, the defense/aerospace industries have lost much of their clout, moving California into the reliably Democratic side of the tally and tilting the balance of power in favor of the Yankees  (this is my analysis not, to my knowledge, Oglesby’s).  And, if you look at it through this prism, you can also see that the Democrat’s focus on global warming and desire to eliminate fossil fuels, while they are legitimate causes for many,  are also an aspect of this war and a means to eliminate the last major power center of the right.  Cruz represents adherence to the old Cowboy model, while Trumpism (and, to a lesser degree, Romneyism before it) reflects a surrender by the Right to the power of the Yankee financial power center.

        The same thing happened in France in the years leading up to the revolution. Many of those ranting against absolutism and feudalism were those who benefitted from the system, directly or indirectly, while the actual victims of the system merely seethed. They weren’t heard from until the upper middle class and nobility had successfully rebelled against the king. We need to be ready for when our chance comes.

        Yes, the Republican establishment, like the Progressives, still wants to see itself as a plucky little David standing alone against enormous odds.  I swear, they all have a mental image of themselves standing alone, silhouetted against the sky on a vast darkling plain.  A few weeks ago Mark Steyn wrote about this Republican delusion:  “At an event with Newt Gingrich about a decade ago, one of my neighbors asked why the Republicans were so ineffectual. Newt said it was because they’re still getting used to being the majority party. Somebody responded, “So the Iraqis are supposed to get the hang of self-government after six months, but the Republican Party still can’t manage it after ten years?”

            I don’t think that’s true at all.  The entire reason these people have such power is because a rather large percentage of mankindwantsto be ruled.

                People DO want to be ruled- competently. See “Heaven, Mandate of.” When the people doing the ruling are this precise blend of obnoxious and incompetent, it’s time for a regime change.
