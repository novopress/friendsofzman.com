            I tried watching the latest Mummy with Tom Cruise. I was having a few beers and looking for a dumb movie to watch. I would have preferred two hours of ‚ÄúOw, My Balls‚Äù over what i got. I made it about 30 minutes and realized I could not drink enough, fast enough to enjoy that movie.

                The best ‚ÄúMummy‚Äù was the one Hammer did in the sixties, the Peter Cushing version. Ann Coulter confessed that she just watched AMC and TMC to see white people. Watching old movies you really see how prole drift and the toxicity of lower-class black culture have turned us all to crap, from the way we talk, eat, to the way we dress. Even watching a movie from the 80s (like ‚ÄúPretty in Pink‚Äù or ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù) I‚Äôm shocked at how much we‚Äôve devolved and how rapidly Europeans are being culturally displaced.

                    The John Hughes movies are the chronicle of my ‚Äô70s high school days.  ‚ÄúBreakfast Club‚Äù especially nails it.  The kids are mostly white, not particularly intelligent, fairly innocent, and spend the movies carving out a life for themselves in the middle of the broader American white middle class cultural chaos of the day.There is another thing in those movies.  The kids occasionally bump up a bit into racial situations, the occasional gay thing, and a lot of male-female social interactions.  They are often awkwardly handled, and many times the interactions are completely inappropriate by current standards.  But the kids all generally just roll over them and carry on.  Not at all what happens now, where the world stops spinning on its axis, and everyone argues about what it all means and whose feelings were violated, every time something marginally inappropriate takes place.

                            That movie ‚Äì although it‚Äôs supposed to take place somewhere in Texas, (and I was in MA)  VERY closely resembles my high school experience in the late 70‚Äôs / early 80‚Äôs.  The got the clothes pretty close, the way kids interacted was close, the cars they drove was right on ‚Äì and the general ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of what it was like to be in HS back then was really good.  That‚Äôs probably the best movie I‚Äôve ever seen that captured what it was like to be in HS back then.

                        I‚Äôve come to think we‚Äôre going through a Chinese-style Cultural Revolution. In those years it focused on driving out the ‚Äòfour Olds‚Äô as dictated by the CCP, and in its ferocity it burned itself out after 9 years. Its was unsustainable due to its irrationality. The West is experiencing something similar but here it‚Äôs a perfect storm of many changes happening simultaneously. True in china it was instigated by one old man‚Äôs insatiable need to hang on to power, but it took on a momentum. Don‚Äôt underestimate either the multiple deranged social revolutions unfolding now in the Muslim world. The West may end up the least worst of the lot. Though frankly it‚Äôs hard to see Europe surviving.

                The studio/distro did catch on and spent roughly $0.00 on marketing and released it at about the worst possible time to ensure it did poorly.
Still, Idiocracy was prophetic and a warning.  Sad that others read it as a plan for action.

                    I‚Äôd heard the reason for the lack of a push from the studio was simpler, that because Judge had slandered so many corporations that Fox didn‚Äôt want to offend (from Carl‚Äôs Jr. to Costco), they decided to let Idiocracy die. The deeper implications of the film might have given them the heebie jeebies too, though.

                        Possible, but what I heard was, King of the Hill was successful, and Judge wanted more money.The deal Fox made was ‚Äùno raise, but we‚Äôll make your movie‚Äù, he took it. They gave it a small budget ($5-10 mil. est.) and then limited release.A great meme, but not that great a movie, I‚Äôve seen it, it has a distinct ‚Äòmade for TV‚Äô look to it. Not as funny as you might think either.

        ‚ÄúIf they can get global audiences habituated to enjoying two hours of explosions, it simplifies their business even further‚Äù
Maybe this is why Hollywood types are so eager to get as much foreign aid to Africa as possible. They want those projected 4 billion natives to be able to afford movie tickets.  And no, I‚Äôm not joking.

            True,the Global market is the cash cow that allows Hollywood to reap huge profits while pissing on the natives. The endless remakes and dearth of original ideas are evidence. Sad part is,the native population is what made Hollywood King of the World.

        One thing that Hollywood can do that independents on the internet can‚Äôt (yet) is provide effective propaganda for the masses. When you can dress up a degenerate behavior or group of people you can make them more palatable to the non-thinking populace. This is why for years television and movies have all promoted gays. By giving them an appealing face and explaining that their behavior is innate, you can sell the narrative that they are just like everybody else and their ‚Äúlove‚Äù is as legitimate as anyone else‚Äôs. Anyone that opposes this is just ‚Äúevil‚Äù. This also explains the need to insert minorities into areas they never would be or could be, like the King Arthur bomb. I actually wonder if there isn‚Äôt a financial quid pro quo for television shows and movies that promote gay, transgender, minority ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù, pro-immigration, and self-destructive policies and behaviors. This would subsidize movies that contain a ‚Äúsanctified‚Äù theme but will bomb at the box office. When you can also trash the White Male ‚Äòpatriarchy‚Äô, you serve a valuable function for our rulers.

            The decay of commercial TV will be interesting. People get most of their agit-prop from commercials. Look at all the ads selling miscegenation. Ad makers are, by definition, propagandists. Their most effective work is in video. Cord cutting and fragmentation make it hard to proselytize this way.

        I recently moved to a new apt and having had 5 years of free internet at the old address‚Ä¶decided that i wanted to continue to enjoy not paying the outrageous monthly fee for high speed internet.i still have a data plan for my phone i can use to keep up on the various blogs i frequent but as far as the massive amounts of movies and youtube i used to consume, i dont miss it.i used to convince myself that i wasnt wasting time because i was watching lectures and analysis on youtube, not tv, but it‚Äôs self deception.Now i‚Äôve breezed through novels i had previously been nursing for months and am keeping up on the housework to boot.i figure i have the entire western canon to keep me busy in lieu of the internet.

        I don‚Äôt know enough about technology to speculate on whether or not an internet ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù (not just selective restrictions, as in China) is already a reality or just something Alex Jones rants about. I do think that if enough of us small people cut into enough of the profits and power of the big people, they won‚Äôt stand for it (I think Google and other search engines manipulate search results to control discourse and what content can be seen, which is a  soft version of this control).As for Hollywood, the problem is simple. William Goldman, whose credits include ‚ÄúButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Princess Bride‚Äù, once said that ‚ÄúNobody knows anything.‚Äù That‚Äôs doubly true in Hollywood. You can assemble the highest grossing screenwriter, highest grossing actor, hottest director, and still end up with a steaming pile after post-production. Take ‚ÄúLast Action Hero‚Äù with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The studio was so convinced of the film‚Äôs success that they even paid for an ad on the fuselage of an unmanned NASA rocket for $500,000. What demographic were they trying to reach? Martians? The movie bombed. Meanwhile the Coens made a movie in Minnesota‚Äôs barren winter for a measly 7 million about a pregnant cop whose husband paints postage stamps, and it became a huge hit and cultural phenomenon.There‚Äôs nothing wrong with not knowing what‚Äôs going to be a hit or what isn‚Äôt, but the people involved on the money side of the thing have too much ego to cede even a little control, even when they‚Äôre going bankrupt (as happened to RKO and several other studios and will happen again). They‚Äôre also morally bankrupt. Google ‚ÄúDon Simpson,‚Äù Jerry Bruckheimer‚Äôs partner on a lot of mega-hits in the 80s. He had a $100,000 a month hooker and coke habit until his heart stopped. It‚Äôs just the imperial hubris of greasy cokeheads in LA who have contempt for the American people and shove shit down our throats. Even people of average intelligence know when they‚Äôre being insulted. ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù films are slow, long, and challenging, for instance, but they‚Äôre great and quality sells, and, more importantly, endures.

        Nice to hear you are enjoying Kodi. üôÇ I will never pay to watch a movie in the theater again. I completely agree with you ‚Äì ‚ÄúKong‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMummy‚Äù were horrible. If you like creepy movies, ‚ÄúA Cure for Wellness‚Äù is pretty good if you liked ‚ÄúShutter Island‚Äù.You might try some European movies now and then even if you have to read subtitles ‚Äì these are a bit old now, but still very watchable;  ‚ÄúUnsere M√ºtter, unsere V√§ter: retitled ‚ÄúGeneration War‚Äù  is a WW2 movie focusing on five friends and how the war affects them. ‚ÄúFrantz‚Äù is a very good drama about a French soldier who seeks out the German family of the soldier he killed in WW1. The 2013 Russian film ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù is also very good and the CGI is excellent.One thing you will begin to realize after watching European movies is they are not written to have happy endings like American movies.

        I did a study of when TV flipped from mostly male to mostly female viewing. What I came up with somewhere in the early 1980s. My methodology was to take starting from 1971 through the mid 2000s or so, the Wikipedia entries for the Fall only TV schedule. As the networks best guess at what would sell. I would look at each show and if pressed read the wiki entries and the lead actors to classify them as either female or male oriented. For example Hart to Hart was female oriented as was Remington Steele, while Hunter, the A-Team, and Miami Vice were male. Then I‚Äôd add up the hours in each category for each season and graph them. The hours crossed somewhere in the early 1980s. There were many flaws in the methodology but it was good for a rule of thumb.All of this is that ads are made to sell to women. Young women are the most desired consumer group; they spend the most and women in aggregate make or influence according to Marketer Dogma 85% of consumer purchases. Most marketing departments are also run by women with mostly women workers; and media buyers are almost entirely young White women.White female/Black male couples are very popular among that demo. Black men have a much higher tolerance for fatties and sluts; and much lower aggregate IQs which leads to pimp-like behavior which women crave instead of nerd like behavior which women find repellent. Look at Lena Dumham; her character in her show which she owns and writes ends up having some greasy Pakistani dude‚Äôs baby. Sure: Brad Pitt and Prince Harry are the preferred models but substitution of some low IQ hood rat is always on the menu.The degeneracy of modern Western culture is a direct function of the young, unmarried, White female marketplace. And the catering that goes on to their fairly incompatible desires with a functioning society.

        Sometimes it‚Äôs easy to let Hollywood activism ruin a show. Feminist Ghost Busters. Those negro ladies that did all the hard math so that the honkies at Mission Control could put a white man on the moon.

Hollywood needs to go back to entertainment and give up on the politics and social justice lectures. If that is the crap they are going to make, they deserve to lose money on it.

        One can hope that the democratization of art (in the broadest sense of that word) will lead to a new appreciation of it ‚Äî if anyone can do it, then only the best will get audiences.  But I suspect we‚Äôll see the same thing that happened to other ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù art forms like prose and poetry ‚Äî since anyone can do them, eggheads had to invent all kinds of credentials to award themselves.  There should be a zillion people out there writing great poetry, since the cost of entry is zero, but the academic-industrial complex got ahold of it, and now the only poetry that‚Äôs written is heavily subsidized incomprehensible junk (e.g. ‚Äúpoet laureate‚Äù is just another make-work Diversity job).

        As a species, we evolved as elite problem solvers. We are descended from the survivors who overcame extreme and diverse hardships, routine existential threats, and the worse sort of calamities that the ancient environment could throw at us (including ice ages). The primordial urge to face and overcome this gauntlet is endemic and will scream from our subconscious when the present world becomes too soft and tame to requite this need. Everyday reality isn‚Äôt bad-ass enough, so Hollywood and video games are the substitute.

        Today‚Äôs movies seem to be made by people on drugs for people on drugs.  The last movie I watched in a theater was Black Swan.  The unsocialized critters in the theater were so loud and rude I‚Äôll probably not go again unless I‚Äôm visiting a county like Japan and there are subtitles.  TV has become cholesterol for the brain, so I have happily retuned to reading as a pastime.

        The really big innovation for podcasts is a website called Patreon.  It sets up automatic credit card payments per podcast released.  When hundreds of people are paying you one, two or five dollars per podcast, all of a sudden you are earning a real living.

        I‚Äôve always been puzzled by the tendency of decade, or older, special effects to look ridiculous/cheesy in retrospect.  Why did it not look silly at the time of release? It‚Äôs almost as is if the films were retroactively edited to add suspension wires to the spaceships, or the rubber masks were made to look cheaper and more ill-fitting.  Perhaps it‚Äôs the perception of novelty/innovation during the initial viewing that blinds us to the imperfections, similar to how clunky iPhone 1.0 looks today.

        Let me add that the FT figured that TV production far outweighs the movie production in value for big Hollywood studios. Which might make as many as six or seven movies in a year now but ALWAYS have their lots busy with TV, that has a global selling point now with streaming. There is a reason both Amazon and Netflix are investing in billions in content, and almost all of it series TV.Traditional TV runs about $3-4 million per episode to film. License fees from networks pick up about $2-3 million per episode, or did a few years ago. Which makes TV less risky ‚Äî instead of shilling out say $200 million plus or more including marketing; with yes a few partners dumb enough to co-finance but those very hard to find now and once burned never to return ‚Äî a 22 episode season requires only $44 million max upfront costs, and maybe breaks even during its production run. Even the most underperforming show if it goes more than one season can be sold into the streaming and international market which always needs new content. Heck decades after most of its actors passed away, ‚ÄúThe Rifleman,‚Äù ‚ÄúHave Gun Will Travel,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaverick‚Äù are still earning good money for the studios that own them.

        You mentioned the distribution bar removed by the Internet, and while correct, I see a an artificial one in the making with digital content being reformatted to become exclusive. A proliferation of unique and non-standard file formats that will play on the provider‚Äôs platform. The varetity of video and sound files seems to keep growing, and create a business to make the consumer to constantly update their software to play them.

        ZMan, you forgot a couple important aspects about film finance. First, investing in Hollywood films is a great way to launder money. Money launderers don‚Äôt even need to get all their money back, just enough of it to justify what the market will bear for money laundering services. Hollywood accounting is opaque enough that the studios can probably guarantee money launderers a specific rate of return, then cook the books behind the scenes by shifting costs between movies to make everything even out. Probably most major studio movies involve money laundering to at least a certain extent, you need a big studio‚Äôs involvement to shift the costs around and make the books right for everybody involved.The second source of financing is propaganda-for-hire. For example, if you are running one of the big Deep State ratlines‚Äìsex trafficking, child trafficking, drug trafficking, organ trafficking‚Äì and you need to do a limited hangout, hollywood will do the job. Again, making money isn‚Äôt the concern, managing the narrative is job #1, and once again opaque Hollywood accounting helps define the risk/reward profile for the client, with hollywood taking the upside risk. ‚ÄúThe Whistleblower‚Äù is a good example of one of these movies, the idea being to sanitize/cordon off/manage perceptions regarding the exposure of the sex and organ trafficking ratlines in Kosovo. Certain actors and actresses seem to specialize in these movies, like Rachel Weisz or Naomi Watts, which makes them easier to spot in the wild once you know who to start looking for.

        I enjoyed Kong:Skull Island as a mostly fun popcorn seller, despite it flaws (female lead was a 6 tops, SLJ is now tiresome x infinity, helicopters flying stupidly low), but I‚Äôm a kaiju fan who owns dozens of giant monster flicks.My enjoyment was probably enhanced by the fact that the last movie I had seen in the theater was Rogue One. Blecch. And as compared to the BORING Godzilla movie with B. Cranston, it was quite entertaining as STUFF HAPPENED.I‚Äôll be interested in seeing if Pacific Rim 2 can fix some of the many problems that the first one suffered from (mind-melding BS tops my personal list), though I might just wait for it on cable/Prime/Netflix.

            ‚Äúdespite it flaws (female lead was a 6 tops‚ÄùI have noticed this in a lot of movies and TV shows over the past few years. It is probably to fight against the Male Patriarchy‚Äôs unfair obsession with beautiful females.So, to educate the Neanderthals, virtue signaling Hollyweird will display rather drab looking females, since everyone knows that both men and women desire to see unattractive females on screen (sarcasm). It could also be that less beautiful women are less expensive than their attractive counterparts. Of course, it could be because the ((((elite‚Äôs)))) daughters want to be in movies, even though they are rather bow wow and papa accommodates them.
