        Predicting over 200 comments today if history of this blog is any guide.
Conspiracy theories wouldn’t be anywhere near as prevalent if fake news wasn’t the predominant form of information for us. Many people go into all of this when they are given nothing but lies and constant gaslighting.

            Two things are true. Most people say conspiracy theories are crazy. Most people support at least one conspiracy theory.

                Thursday before a holiday posts tend not to have a lot of comments, so I doubt it sets a record. I could be wrong, but traffic goes into decline starting now until late summer.

            This is spot on. The popularity of conspiracy theories is in direct proportion to the among of fake news pushed by the government.How could it not when the government and Jews said that Saddam was behind 9/11 and he was a mortal threat to the U.S. and convinced the American people to invade ad occupy Iraq.Today it’s Iran and Syria we’re beating the war drums on.Before that there was Waco and the OKC bombing.   Conspiracies grew around those because of the pile of lies and misdirections of the government.Just a few days ago a F-16 loaded with munitions crashed in Los Angeles. The AF spokesman and authorities flat out refuse to admit the plane was load ed with 20mm rounds.  They just stood there repeating the same lines over and over. like robots. No one could trust them.As long as the government and press openly lie to us and censor  even local news. Conspiracies will grow.

                “. Conspiracies grew around those because of the pile of lies and misdirections of the government. ”
Nonsense
“. Conspiracies grew around those”  because they were conspiracies: government agents, and others conspired (from Latin “to breathe together”) to commit illegal acts.

                    bilejones – I’ve seen for a long time that you get it… So, folks – just FYI, know why there are so many conspiracy theories? Because there are a lot of genuine conspiracies. The fact that many readers here don’t get that is why we’re going to lose. Because after all – after all – after all – the talk here, most people still trust the ‘gubment. Hint! – the ‘gubment is typically lying to you.

                        Here’s a one a year list for a cpuple of decades.Thanks for the laugh.Here’s just one a year for a couple of decades.http://www.proliberty.com/observer/20100409.htm1950 In an experiment to determine how susceptible an American city would be to biological attack, the U.S. Navy sprays a cloud of bacteria from ships over San Francisco. Monitoring devices are situated throughout the city in order to test the extent of infection. Many residents become ill with pneumonia-like symptoms.1951 Department of Defense begins open-air tests using disease-producing bacteria and viruses. Tests last through 1969 and there is concern that people in the surrounding areas have been exposed.1953 U.S. military releases clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide gas over Winnipeg, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Fort Wayne, the Monocacy River Valley in Maryland, and Leesburg, Virginia. Their intent is to determine how efficiently they could disperse chemical agents.1953 Joint Army-Navy-CIA experiments are conducted in which tens of thousands of people in New York and San Francisco are exposed to the airborne germs Serratia marcescens and Bacillus glogigii.1953 CIA initiates Project MKULTRA. This is an eleven-year research program designed to produce and test drugs and biological agents that would be used for mind control and behavior modification. Six of the sub-projects involved testing the agents on unwitting human beings.1955 The CIA, in an experiment to test its ability to infect human populations with biological agents, releases bacteria withdrawn from the Army’s biological warfare arsenal over Tampa Bay, Florida.1955 Army Chemical Corps continues LSD research, studying its potential use as a chemical incapacitating agent. More than 1,000 Americans participate in the tests, which continue until 1958.1956 U.S. military releases mosquitoes infected with Yellow Fever over Savannah, GA and Avon Park, Florida. Following each test, Army agents posing as public health officials test victims for effects.1958 LSD is tested on 95 volunteers at the Army’s Chemical Warfare Laboratories for its effect on intelligence.1960 The Army Assistant Chief-of-Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) authorizes field-testing of LSD in Europe and the Far East. Testing of the European population is code-named Project THIRD CHANCE; testing of the Asian population is code named Project DERBY HAT.1965 CIA and Department of Defense begin Project MKSEARCH, a program to develop a capability to manipulate human behavior through the use of mind-altering drugs.1965 Prisoners at the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia are subjected to dioxin, the highly toxic chemical component of Agent Orange used in Viet Nam. The men are later studied for development of cancer, which indicates that Agent Orange had been a suspected carcinogen all along.1966 CIA initiates Project MKOFTEN, a program to test the toxicological effects of certain drugs on humans and animals.1966 U.S. Army dispenses Bacillus subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway system. More than a million civilians are exposed when army scientists drop light bulbs filled with the bacteria onto ventilation grates.1967 CIA and Department of Defense implement Project MKNAOMI, successor to MKULTRA and designed to maintain, stockpile and test biological and chemical weapons.1968 CIA experiments with the possibility of poisoning drinking water by injecting chemicals into the water supply of the FDA in Washington, D.C.1969 Dr. Robert MacMahan of the Department of Defense requests from congress $10 million to develop, within 5 to 10 years, a synthetic biological agent to which no natural immunity exists.That’s the edited highlights of the 50’s and 60’s.

        The only conspiracy theory I buy is the one where the neocons want us to go to war with Russia for some reason (n.b. that while there are a lot of Jews in that one, one of the biggest cheerleaders of war against Russia was none other than Hillary Clinton).  Russia is not a military threat.  China, however, IS a military threat, IS spying on us, IS up to all kinds of shenanigans, does have honest-to-god spies in our government (Feinstein’s aide)… but you don’t hear a peep about Beijing “interfering with our democracy,” even though they clearly do, and to their enormous benefit.  Wonder why that is.

            $$$ is why.  Problem is our corporations love cheap Chinese labor and are willing to sell out the country to get access to China’s market.This is why Google, Cisco and a host of other companies are working hand in glove with the ChiComs.And  make no mistake our intelligence assets have been well aware of the Chinese espionage going back to the mid-80’s when they were classified as threat  #1, oddly enough the Israelis are like #2..The reason Chinese spying gets no press is because of big business ties to China(which now include Hollywood). Also it’s not PC to make the Chinese look treacherous. Lastly some of the crazies in the HBD movement  are busy trying to promote the Han as our natural allies/saviors. They ain’t. They tend to view us as sub-humans. They have one allegiance that is to China even if they are born and raised here.  This is why ChiCom agents have no problem flipping  high profile Chinese Americans to work for them.

            It can certainly be said that most neocons are either Jews or, if not Jews are heavily allied with Israel’s interests.  Hello John Bolton.  Israel and Saudi Arabia have a very out of proportion handle on the U.S. Government.   Trump says we are going to be out of Syria and some people/organizations or whoever decide we are staying.   Couple this by Trump’s statement that we are in Syria for Israel’s security.Call it a conspiracy theory if you want to but it is obvious that Israel and Saudi Arabia control much of our foreign policy initiatives.   Their libs in government control much of the domestic agenda as well.  Can you say that most of their stated agenda items are good for the country?

        Well, Caucasians… you are unique in that 50% of you carry the empathy gene.  In other races, it is at best 10%.  When you import 10% empathy genes into your 50% empathy gene society, the net effect is going to be a low trust society.
Chisel this into a stone so that the society that arises after the next dark age can find it.

        Conspiracies are a constant fixture of History. To deny that there are conspiracies is to deny history.
On the topic of noticing,. I gave up on the Demonic Cesspool that is the entertainment business many years ago but I couldn’t help noticing it is Jewish controlled. It is always given me pause

        Not that long ago, I spent quite a few hours looking into various conspiracy theories, such as 9-11, Sandy Hook, and the Boston Marathon bombing.  Whenever I dive in and decide to study something I usually realize that the more I learn, the more I realize what I don’t know.  And for these specific events, I’m not smug enough to know exactly what happened, but there’s enough evidence to be very skeptical of the official story if you apply Occam’s Razor.

        My (conspiracy) theory is that conspiracies theories emerge whenever the official narrative doesn’t make sense.  That Las Vegas shooting is the prime example.  The police never released any of the hotel surveillance footage, the guy reeked of CIA / drug courier, if he really wanted to die killing a lot of people he could have just crashed one of his aircraft into the crowd, the official timeline is all wrong…

            Las Vegas is a great example of an event where the official story makes no sense.  Other than the shooting actually happening, which it did, almost everything else about the narrative appears very suspicious.

                PJW was trying to peddle some absurd conspiracy theory after the Vegas shooting that there was a second shooter on the 4th floor.
Anyone with direct knowledge of the location could easily see this is absurd.  Not only are there large trees in the way, but that location would not have had a vantage point on the festival goers.
Don’t get me started on Laura Loomer’s nonsense about doctors being told to hide evidence…

        I’ve read a bit about the “dancing Israelis,” and I listened to that TDS show, and let me tell you, that entire story is very suspicious. As best as I can understand it, it seems the claim is not that the it was an inside job by Israelis, but rather that Israeli intelligence discovered the plot, knew all about it, was surveilling the participants, interacting with them, and possibly surreptitiously aiding them.Our government only adds to the suspicion by, when they finally released the photographs of the “dancing Israelis,” washing out the images so much that you can’t see the World Trade Center towers burning in the background.

            Replace “Israeli intelligence” with “FBI” and you *might* have something resembling sanity here, although it’s far more likely the FBI just blew the whole thing and wanted to blame it on anyone was not either (a) FBI or (b) brown.
Those supposed photos don’t even show dancing or smiling or anything else. It’s the most ridiculous story ever. Here’s a photo of some people just standing around: we couldn’t find any evidence whatsoever, but they must have been in on it!

            The world seems to more and more resemble a black hole, so many things get sucked into the black memory hole, it’s hard to remember them all. Mostly I just notice that no one in government ever goes to jail -unless it’s politically expedient. We live in an anarcho tyranny, where cynicism and skepticism iare the only ways to stay completely sane.Im a firm believer in the Grand Solar Minimum, but you don’t see that gaining any traction anywhere even though there’s been some good science done on it, mostly by Europeans.

        There’s a conspiracy theory that some of the conspiracy theories are planted and promoted by the elites to make all of the conspiracy theorists appear crazy and to discredit the ones that are getting too close to the truth.

        The last two paragraphs about importing the Middle East culture of distrust and intrigue–making our current paranoid situation here even worse, is true and depressing.  I knew an Arab guy as a kid.  He was always remarking about how trusting and trustworthy Americans are.  He really liked Americans for that, having come from a place where everyone dicked each other over as a matter of course.  He also thought we were bafflingly naive. The whole, give a person the benefit of the doubt thing didn’t compute with him.

        Many conspiracy theories gain credibility by being things that could have happened without the intervention of the supernatural or magic, etc.  For instance, whether it really happened or not, it was physically possible for Mossad (or however the Dancing Israeli narrative goes) to have aided the 9/11 attackers or have known what was going down and not told anyone.But how the hell did Russia make Americans vote wrong?  It’s not physically possible without some kind of magic or mind control.  It’s not like saying that other gunmen were involved with Lee Harvey Oswald.  It’s more like saying the other gunman were Martians shooting Kennedy with laser beams.

        It’s not at all odd that Israeli nationals are running moving companies, locksmiths, IT security companies, and the like. Steve Sailer explains it in the first few comments below this post:
https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/02/time-inconsistent-locksmiths.html
“There appears to be a general pattern of Israeli intelligence encouraging blue collar Israelis who go to America for work to get jobs where they get to barge into otherwise locked places. If they see something interesting, well, drop a line to Mossad.”

        Yeah, when Z wants to jazz things up a bit he picks these topics…works on me!The thing about the dancing Israelis story(I thought this was confirmed, wasn’t it?), the rumor that all or many or most Jews called in sick on 9/11, or all or most dual citizens, depending on which redaction you hear, is that these rumors were in circulation almost immediately after 9/11, I’m talking the next day.  There was also the story of the Israeli art students who had been tracking the hijackers and who were supposedly investigated.The curious thing about that is that very few people understood the connection between Israel and 9/11 at that point.  Think about it—that was before the Iraq war even occurred or was considered a serious possibility, before mearshimer and Walt, any of that.  The cui bono aspects of the puzzle weren’t even in place yet.  Why would people have jumped to those conclusions, given that most people in elite American society are gushingly philosemitic?

                    Ursula, not a chance.  There also used to be all sorts of little boxes and things attached high up on the light poles around here, and most (but not all) are gone now.  One still here has a small dish and line-of-sight to a similarly configured direct download to the local water pumping station.  The few others, I don’t know.
The trucks that would occasionally “service” these things with cherry pickers were always new, white, and without logos or names of any sort on them.

                The Israelis are very big into spying on our military assets. They are right behind China in this. When Israeli contractors would show up at a U.S. military base and they were coming to your workplace. The place would go on near lock down. The Israelis would would show up with two escorts each who watched everything they did.  If they caught them looking at something they were supposed to – well they were grabbed and removed from base.  They did not f**k with them.People who pooh pooh the Jews as some sort of harmless nepotistic tribals are dead wrong about them. They are outright predators who presence and domination of our society has has horrific consequences for us a nation. So bad that that we will lose our country because of them.

            Also, I would opine that 9/11 conspiracy theory or investigation is of a different nature from the others.  9/11 and its consequences and costs were enormous, of a civilizationally wrenching magnitude.  Even the worst of the spree shooters or assasinations are trivial in comparison with simply primary event of 9/11, let alone the decades of war which have ensued.

He’s just grasping at straws to try to explain why the behavior of people involved with Sandy Hook is so bizarre.  Google videos for “Gene Rosen” or “Robbie Parker” and tell me what you think.  All the alternative explanations are even worse for the people involved.

            Jones is definitely off in the tall grass in regards to the school shootings. The poor fella can’t wrap his head around the fact that this isn’t 1980. Public schools are totally different than when he attended them.For instance:1) Mainstreaming mentally disabled and violent kids who should be kept in special schools/priosn or remove altogether. Lanza and th FLA are classic examples of this.2) Doping children with SRI’s to control their behavior despite the manufacturers warning them those drugs are not ment for them. This turns a small percentage into full blown rage monsters who go on rampages. One thing you notice the MSM has stopped mentioning if the shooters are on any kind of medication.3) Schools authorities usually refuse to remove troublemakers and the mentally infirm from class even when they are a threat. HighLand High school shooting in CO is a example.Most public schools are flat out unfit for kids. Even Jordan Peterson says that. He says get your kids out of them if you care about them.

        I once took a road trip through new mexico with a couple of friends: a diamond broker and a real estate investor. Triple paren’s lol.If you’ve ever been to northern new mexico you know there’s a culture of fringe. UFO tourism, ‘alternative’ communities, off-grid enthusiasts, and things like “earthship biotecture”.It is also, to steal a lefty fave, a landscape of disparity and intersectionality.Extreme wealth in conspicuous beautiful compounds as well as some upcycled adobe hut. Dirt poor in trailers and dirt poor by choice in geodesic domes. Hippies and artists but also darpa researchers and hedge fund black box types and a lot of “government” land to color with conspiracy.My buddies loved it, probably because it is a landscape ripe with conspiracy fodder that is perhaps a bit like their homeland.Something that has always struck me about the special people I have known is their affinity for superstition. My two dancing Israelis included. Very smart people prone to rabbit holes and see nothing incongruent about openly holding such views.Superstition invites conspiracy quite easily. But unlike other conspiracy nuts, their tendencies toward magic seem to fall somewhere between neutral and accretive to their bottom line. Now that is something.Personally I want nothing to do with aliens. The cheap tacos aren’t worth the other costs.

        The Zionists have staged attacks on themselves before. The Lavon Affair being one of them. Who know’s what else has occurred. Also, bad people do int fact shoot up schools, Alex Jone’s claims the conspiracy is to take our guns in the name of protecting us. Also, NYC is full of weirdos, I would bet money that faking a shooting in a nowhere area like Sandy Hook would be easy. Also, You need to modernize this website, college students are taught about false flags in modern history courses. It is possible to stage an attack on yourself. Machivelli also preached it.

        For example, the official narrative of the RFK killing is less believable than most of the conspiracy theories around the JFK assassination.Absolutely. I recently read Lisa Pease and James DiEugenio’sbook on the subject.If even half of what they write is true, it’s enough to drive you full Alex Jones. They’re rather long-winded, but the core take-away for me was this: every witness placed Sirhan about a yard or two in front of Kennedy. The ballistics expert placed the shooter behind him and to the right, with the muzzle less than an inch from the entry wounds.Unfortunately, Lisa Pease goes on about MK Ultra and how Oswald, James Earl Ray and Sirhan were all hypnotized. As if the CIA couldn’t find simpler way to force compliance, especially from a guy like Sirhan with family in Palestine. There are worse fates than life in prison.

        I think there’s sometimes a kernel of truth (or more than a kernel) to some conspiracy theories, but as the initial theory accrues more and more layers, the adults seem to leave the room and the grifters and fear mongers (like Jim Marrs or Alex Jones) start to move in. There’s quite a bit evidence that the crack explosion was in large part just a side-effect of the drugs-for-arms deals going on in South and Central America in the 80s. But from there, Kangz start talking about how whitey invented the crack rock and AIDS to kill the Negro, like Ollie North and Reagan were just sitting around in lab coats with test tubes and beakers and mixing this stuff in with the Colonel’s 11 herbs and spices. On the other end, you have people who are I think consciously using a conspiracy framework as a metaphor for an evil that’s real and in our faces every day. It’s easy to understand David Icke’s appeal when people like Nancy Pelosi are on TV everyday.

        That’s interesting that you bring up the sort of person who goes all in for conspiracy theories. I have an acquaintance on the facebook who is all in on all conspiracy theories. Fake Moon Landing, Flat Earth, Illuminati, the works.What I noticed about this guy, is (and I don’t mean this to be mean to him), but he’s a real loser. No job, not in school, no education/training after high school, lives at home with an uncle, unattractive and out of shape fellow. But still lusts after girls way out of his league and complains about women being ‘gold-diggers’, ‘stuck up bitches’ etc.Instead of admitting to yourself that you’re a 1 or 2 in desirability and doing what it takes to improve your lot in life, it’s easier to retreat into an online space with your fellow weirdos and declare that everyone else out there is a sheep/conformist living in the Matrix, and that you’re the only free mind out there. See he’s not really a 2, it’s only in the fake reality that ‘the man’ has thrown up that he’s a dud. We just need to all believe and declare that he’s Neo and his problems will all be solved.

        Conspiracy theories function as a group sorting mechanism.  Official stories serve the powers that be.  Other explanations serve other groups in this competition. The more corrupt and dishonest leaders are perceived to be the more people seek something more plausible, at least to them—-The JQ has been a Q since the ancient world. All of their contemporaries from the Ancient Middle East and from the Classical world are gone. There are no Hittites or Babylonians or Pagan Greeks or Persian Great Kings.  But the Jews have managed to survive…..probably due to their group evolutionary strategy which is a form of parasitism: they were never dominant, they’ve always needed to attach themselves to some other group with more going for it.  Parasites by their very nature need to be highly adaptable.  They never rule the roost and they can always find another willing host.  Maybe this is why they’ve managed to survive for so long while maintaining group identity and cohesion.Group competition and conflict is part of nature. Conspiracy is in large part a way of understand this conflict regardless of how close or far it may be from the truth.

            Jews of today are as unlike Jews of Caesar’s time as Jews of Solomon’s time. That they were often conquered and enslaved is unsurprising as forced labor is valuable in a non monetary economy.Jews are merely lucky, and outmarriage  guarantees that outside Israel they will be extinct. India, China were contemporary of Solomon and are still around much as they were. Persia is still mostly Persia under an Islamic veil.Jews were merely lucky. Having literacy in the West when outside Italy almost all urban lay literacy disappeared. Had Bellisarius reestablished the Empire in the West they would have disappeared into intermarriage.RFK?

        Before it became fashionable, I often looked into conspiracy theories such as those about the JFK assassination. Not that I was a conspiracy theorist myself — I just enjoyed seeing how people constructed their outlandish beliefs out of whatever raw material they could dig up. Sometimes I had to admire the skill and cleverness of the conspiracy promoters, like watching a hobbyist construct a model of Westminster Abbey out of toothpicks.There was no “Eureka!” moment when I shifted into taking any particular theory seriously. Yet I was startled, sometime post-September 11, to realize that in my interest in some of the claims had become a search for truth rather than just entertainment.I haven’t lost my bearings as a skeptic. In any large or complex event, there are bound to be some facts or alleged facts that don’t seem to fit, some individuals’ anecdotes that call the narrative into question. This is as true of historical occurrences as of contemporary ones. And there are conspiracy claims I really don’twantto be valid, because if they are, we are in deep peril.But undeniably this life is dangerous; there’s no way around it. The best we can do is try to use discernment in considering possible conspiracies without buying them too cheaply.

And What about the USS Liberty, that was just an accident? No way it was.He does a good job of covering all the bases from poisoning the wells to goyish child sacrifice.https://www.unz.com/author/ron-unz/

        Conspiracy theories aside, you might want to look at the 9/11m dancing Arabs of Paterson New Jersey. Just twelve miles west of Jersey City where the Dancing Israelies were supposedly celebrating the collapse of the World Trade Center, the Arabs of Paterson were celebrating as well. What makes this story more plausible is that 11 of the 19 hijackers had lived in Paterson for a while. Of course the local Arabs, mostly Palestinians claimed to have had no idea who these guys were despite their presence for several months and their purchase of fake IDs from a local Arab merchant who just happen to be selling IDs good enough to get on a plane. And the FBI wasn’t about to stir things up with lots of investigations. After all, the truth might stir up some anti-Muslim sentiment, just when George Bush was calling Islam the religion of peace. So despite lots of witnesses, including the Paterson police, the story was memory holed.On function of conspiracy theories like the Dancing Israelies is that they serve to mask larger, more painful truths. In this case it works to help erase the open assistance that Paterson’s Arabs gave to the 9/11 hijackers and their real , not imagined, celebration of their murder of thousands of Americans.

            Also the minor detail that given about 20% of Israeli citizens are Arab Muslims,  as hostile to the West as any other Muslim population… why are the tinfoil hats so sure the alleged “dancing Israelis” were Jews?
Seems to me the truthers have convinced themselves of a Big Lie.

        One little discussed things about “conspiracy theories” is that a number of the more extreme ones are promulgated by defenders of the official myth.The classic one is that concerning Barry the Kenyan.The media decries and attacks  the “ludicrous conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya”.That was not the original claim.The claim was, and is, that he was a Kenyan Citizen.According to the Kenyan Constitution, any child of a Kenyan parent, and that would be his putative father, is a Kenyan,I checked the Kenyan Constitution and that is the case, There is no provision for renunciation of citizenship. Barry is a Kenyan,End of story.

        The only conspiracy theory I have heard that makes some sense is the idea that Paddock, the Vegas gunman was part of a firearms deal gone wrong.
There is no way in hell you bring over a score of rifles to conduct a mass shooting.  They are bulky, heavy, and take up carrying capacity that could be used for ammo or body armor.

            I admit I haven’t read much on the Las Vegas shooting…. but didn’t he post alot of pro Sanders anti Republican stuff? And country music audiences tend to be associated with red states and Republicanism.
I assumed he was just a lone wolf who lashed out at the right. The media and lefties in govt bureaucracy just glossed that over so their side wouldn’t get a black eye.

                I looked into records of political donations and there are donations in the name of Stephen Paddock to a lefty PAC in Florida around the time the shooter was living there.
One possibility is that by targeting likely Republicans, they could scare them into supporting gun bans.  Given that Trump and the NRA caved on bump stocks, if that was the case, it worked.

        The problem is the official narrative usually contains a few epicycles.Instead of accepting that our knowledge is and always will be incomplete, eye witnesses often don’t remember right (proven with cameras), and memories get confused (people who wrote journals on 9/12/2001 said they were doing something completely different a few years later), they come up with a differnt theory that requires lots and lots of epicycles.Where a few contradictions exist in the original, you get a conspiracy of thousands or tens of thousands and where no one notices obvious things and there would be a trail of evidence.Human beings are designed to seek patterns – it is part of our survival.  But we also see them where they don’t exist and have confirmation bias.  That’s why every bit of unusual weather is blamed on “climate change” because we want it to be part of a pattern we can have control over even if exercising that control destroys all civilization on earth.

        I haven’t listened to yesterday’s TDS, but I did listen the last time Dawson was on.  I remember I wasn’t impressed with him.
Dawson is fervently anti-Israel, but won’t address the JQ.  As a counter-Semite, I see the rationale behind the ethnocentric policies the Israelis pursue.  I’m as eager as anyone to point out the hypocrisy of said policies, but at the end of the day all I’m looking for is for my country to be able to do the same.
Griping about symptoms without addressing the disease is just verbal masturbation.

            Taking into consideration the number of times he’s been deplatformed, his take seems more of a survival strategy.
I think this is true for a lot of people on whatever platform.  This is also why the Jews are constantly obsessed with reading between the lines.  They’ve had a lot of practice in understanding when their gig is about to come crashing down.

        There’s no way possible to argue that 9-11 was NOT a conspiracy. It would take an encyclopedia to cover all the funny business on 9-11 but there’s one fact that can not be ignored or can not be construed any other way except that insiders were in control on 9-11. All the wars we are in are directly because of the Jews and 9-11. I can prove this easily with two facts. The first is the Jews own all forms of mass communication in the US and they’re not saying a word about the true facts. They can see this as easily as I can and they’re hiding it. When they do talk about it they lie so blatantly that it’s obvious. When I easily counter their lies they censor me. The second follows. Three buildings came down on 9-11.Two came down very odd but at least were hit by planes. Building 7 wasn’t hit by a plane. Notice I use no silly assed laser beam, alien or whatever logic to demonstrate that it was a demoed. On 9-11 building #7 fell the same speed as a rock dropped beside it in free air for roughly 108 feet. This means the building had no resistance to falling except air.All materials fall the same speed in a gravity field disregarding air friction which I don’t thing we need to worry about for a building falling. So the speed of our imaginary rock falling next to the building is just gravity related. The speed of the buildings falling, the exact same as the rock, is just gravity also. This means that there was NOTHING to slow the fall of the building. The density of the material under the imaginary rock falling was air. The building fell the same therefore the density of the material under the building was also air. We know building #7 was not hovering in the air. There is no other explanation that fits the fall of building 7 except for all support for the bottom being removed out from under it to where only air held it up before it fell.It’s makes NO difference how big the fires were. The buildings density never reached the same value as air! The fires did not boil away the building structure where it was light as air! All the talk about damage, fires, this, that, all bullshit because the building fell with all four corners almost level the same speed as a rock in AIR. If a building falls as fast as a rock and the rock is falling through JUST AIR then the building is falling through JUST AIR also. Simple equivalence. 1=1, 2=2, big rock falling in air=small rock falling in air=building falling in air. One problem is people sometimes believe that a really heavy thing will fall faster than a lighter thing. Not true. Look at this video of the Apollo astronaut dropping a feather and a hammer on the Moon. They land at the same time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5_dOEyAfkHere’s a video of reporters going into building #7 AFTER the North tower supposedly fell on it and destroyed it supposedly enough for it to collapse completely. Look at :54 you see the #7 for the building on the door.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLqGRv7CQlcNow you’ve seen video of the inside where there is NO massive damage to make all four sides of the building fall. You want pictures of the back? Here’s a picture of the South side of building #7, facing the North tower, after it had fallen. There is no huge gaping hole. There is no massive fire going all the way up the building. So you can’t say it’s the South side and we have plenty of video and pictures of the North side of building #7 pictures with no damage at all.http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/b7_nofire.jpgHere’ another NIST FOIA released video taken between one and two hours before building #7 fell. There’s around three floors on fire.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IssGRpcB_ms(Watch the reporter pan up at 2:54. You can clearly see the whole building is not on fire. This side shown is the North side of building #7. Later you can see the fires mostly around three or four floors only and in isolated spots.)If the fires were hot enough to melt steel then why isn’t the glass in the windows melted? Glass melts at an extremely lower temperature that steel. Ever put a metal can and a glass bottle in a campfire? The glass bottle melts but the steel can will still be intact. These fires were no hotter than a campfire. One last video of all sides from 23 angles also showing the miraculous collapse.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnLcUxV1dPoFireman retired so now he can talk. He was right next to the damn building. Says,”…there was an explosion and the building came down…”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMdAWlB2SEgHere’s an astoundingly good short video by a mechanical engineer on the other buildings. It probably one of the best I’ve seen. It’s very to the point and sticks to the facts as can be seen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZjOMkieVawFor more info look at a site by some engineers that lay out the evidence.http://www.ae911truth.org/The facts are irrefutable that certain sections of our security in this country are compromised by the Jews and are actively killing our citizens. It’s also true that the whole entire political system is compromised in some way such that they will do nothing about the Jewish attacks on us.

        In 2014 I was invited to join a private group discussing the Sandy Hook shooting. I had been blogging since 2010 and gravitated toward what most would call conspiracies; 9/11, Oklahoma City, the Federal Reserve.A group of 12 broke from the group and decided to make a documentary about the anomalous shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary. The result was “We Need to Talk about Sandy Hook.” The only rules were that each participant script and narrate their own unique segment. There could be no objections to the material, and fortunately there were none. We stitched the segments together, applied a beginning and ending and put it online with a Creative Commons re-use license.We decided to form the group, Independent Media Solidarity (IMS) mostly to identify the documentary’s creators. Little did I know we would still be at work today in various capacities. Most of our projects today, however remain private because we learned early on it’s nearly pointless to publicize our findings.It may surprise some to learn that we don’t all ascribe to the same theories about Sandy Hook or other topics for that matter. Some of us think Adam Lanza shot the children and adults as reported. Some of us think Adam Lanza didn’t, and either the killings were by other means or never happened at all. Personally, I suspect Adam Lanza was deceased before the time of the event. So, our community may be unique in that we don’t coalesce around a particular theory, or as you put it, “…work toward a consensus.” One thing we DO all agree on is that it doesn’t take hundreds of people for a major event to be staged or covered up. Nor do we believe it’s inevitable someone will talk and expose the conspiracy.I’ve read the theories about people harboring Conspiracist Ideology as being, as you put it, “…driven by a need to rationalize events, a need for safety…” If that was what drove me in the beginning, it surely didn’t have that affect in the long term. Frankly, my research and findings have led to more confusion than I began with. And I feel less safe than I did. Maybe this common assessment applies to some people, but not others.One problem that has plagued our efforts is the arm-chair conspiracy theorist. For example, when I learned about the conspiracy of “chemtrails” I began to look into it. Clifford Carnicom was the first person to truly dive into the theory from an objective and scientific perspective. I contacted Clifford, offered to become a volunteer of his institute and did so for over a year. I concluded as he did that the truly concerning issue was Bioengineering, and not so much Geoengineering. I also learned that commercial jets weren’t likely spraying the skies with chemicals, but that atmospheric changes did result in persistent contrails. When I have shared my findings with groups focused on “chemtrails” my words fall on deaf ears.So I’m the first to admit that there are many irrational views being latched onto, even in the face of conflicting evidence. I guess this is evidence for your “subculture” and “group dynamics” theory. Just be aware that there are some of us who are proud “conspiracy theorists,” yet more than willing to change our minds and accept new or conflicting evidence. I’ve found it easier to just think of conspiracies as crimes. And there’s a need for investigation of this type of crime. Think about it. Which is worse, that a kid with autism shot and killed 20 kids and 6 adults, or that the media and certain politicians want us to think it happened that way? I can’t say which is true, but I know which scenario is worse.

        It will be interesting to see if there is a multicultural intersectionality between the white anti-vaxxers here, who believe vaccines cause autism (conspiracy thinking or no? I have no idea.) and the middle eastern crowd (especially Pakistanis) who in most cases devoutly believe the conspiracy talk back at home that vaccines are a Jewish plot to sterilize their women and inject pee-pee shrinkage factor into their boys.

            The vaccine battle is between the two extremes.  Insty posts about vaccines (all vaccines good) and you can see the sides yell past each other.   The irony is that on any other topic, Reynolds will be a gov’t skeptic.   But having a reasoned discussion is impossible.

            Since almost all of the school children are vaccinated, why is it such a big deal if a few do not get vaccinated? After all, the vaccinated children should be safe from catching measles, for example, so what’s the problem? Maybe the zero-liability vaccine makers are worried about the quality of their product being exposed? If so, exactly what are we injecting into our children? If they’re not worried about their product’s quality, then why is it so important that *all* children get vaccinated? Maybe the Paki’s are on to something. As to the kids with with weak immune systems and other health issues for whom it is dangerous to be exposed to such sicknesses, surely no one believes we should vaccinate the hell out of every healthy person so as to protect the weak and genetically damned among us, orienting the health policy for hundreds of millions around the few sickly people?

I’m sure there are many people who believe exactly that, just as there are schools that ban all peanut products on the off chance that one of the students will turn out to be one of those unicorns that drops dead if he’s in the same room as a crumb of a peanut.

        I kind of lose interest in JFK theories.  He was only 75 FEET away from Oswald – ridiculously easy shots for a Marine with a rifle.  Maybe ‘somebody’ put him up to it then had Ruby silence him… but the shooting itself was so easy, why worry about a “grassy knoll” much farther away?

            Not to be all spergy, but Oswald was definitely *not* 75 feet from JFK when he took the shot. I believe the first shot was just under 200 feet and the second was just over 250 feet, and the target was moving. It was by no means an easy shot. Maybe you meant 75 yards?

                    The Known Distance Course (KDC) the Marine Corps uses in order to qualify its marines requires qualifiers to fire from 200, 300, and 500 yards over open sites.  There are also two stages of rapid fire; 10 rounds (2 five round magazines requiring a magazine change and successful stowing of the empty mag) from 200 yards and 10 rounds from 300 yards timed IIRC at 70 seconds.Now the weapon used for qualifying in the late 50’s was different than today obviously, but if the parameters of completing the course were the same then Oswald had the necessary experience and training to pull off the assassination with little technical difficulty.

                That shot was a piece of cake.
I’ve been to the museum, and stood at the window next to the one Oswald used (Oswald’s window and area is behind plexiglass).  Oswald’s window had an even easier angle then the window I looked through.

                    Almost anyone with rifle training can make a shot at that distance with iron sights
Also contrary to what some people say, the  rifle Oswald used was of adequate  quality, not junk  and was scoped as well. It was a simple enough thing  for a former Marine to do.
The only interesting question is if he was patsy or not.
I frankly don’t care myself but some do but hey everyone needs a hobby right.

                The aspect of the shooting involving distance and speed was replicated some time later via the investigating commission and a marksman in a tower with that crap Italian rifle.  he handle it in the required time with a fair amount of accuracy (if I recall from the program, I was young).  The shooting was demonstrated quite possible, but perhaps lucky (or unlucky from JFK’s point of view).   Many years later, with much rifle shooting under my belt, I have not reason to disagree.

                    Calsdad – yes, you’re exactly right, there isn’t any controversy  regarding, “…whether or not Oswald was able to shoot him from the book repository…” because clearly he didn’t. The US’s greatest sniper, Hathcock, reported that they tried at Quantico and couldn’t reproduce the shots.

                        If you can’t make a headshot at 75 yards with a scoped bolt action rifle, you are inferior to most hunters out there. I mostly hunt coyote and ground hogs on my ranch, so all my shots are that precise, and I’m not very good.

                    Oswald only got the job in that building 2 weeks before the shooting. Only days prior, Oswald’s manager made an arbitrary decision to send a co-worker to work that week in another building. He admitted he could just as easily have chosen Oswald. So, at least we know no long term planning was involved were Oswald the shooter. Of course Oswald said, “I’m a patsy.” I suspect he was.

                Dogpiling here because, blow me, I was an infantryman and I like to waggle my cock around, but 75 yards is not a hard shot, even when situated in an elevated position such as the height Oswald was perched at in the Repository.

            Because folk are lazy and inexperienced and gullible, and too needy for an explanation beyond “red commie kills Kennedy.”
Too lazy to look at the ground.  Too inexperienced to know an easy shot if they went to the ground. Too gullible so they will believe whatever folk say, as long as they say it with assurance.  Too needy for a grand conspiracy because the idea of a shitty little commie killing JFK for being to far to the right, what with his anti-commie rhetoric, tax cuts, etc.

            Examined from a “who benefits” standpoint, the interesting thing is that this enabled LBJ to take charge and the (D)irtbag party to establish the roots of our most intractable problems. The talk about grassy knoll and 2nd shooter seems designed to discredit/ distract from questions about the commie fanatic with a soviet minder as a wife, who did the shooting and was then silenced by a gangster – (D)irtbag party affiliates all over and the MSM declaring it due to a “climate of hate”.Kind of like the way discussion of Obama’s “natural born citizen” qualifications were stupidified by the mystery over his birth – which he did nothing to dispel, instead trolled with it. Who cares what dirt he was born on, he only had one citizen parent – the whole NBC qualification makes no sense except  as a way to avoid divided loyalties – Obama’s reign proved why that was a good idea.

            In the footage showing the car speeding off under the overpass, the grassy knoll is to the right of the shot. You can clearly see gunsmoke drifting into the frame. I’m amazed at how little this is discussed.

        Once upon a time, our evolutionary ancestors developed complex language, which led to higher intelligence and self awareness. A deeper understanding of nature followed, but it was primitive and filled with lots of unknowns. As such, we evolved coping mechanisms to deal with these unknowns, but would still allow for proactive responses to reality. The invention of “Gods” (and there use to explain the grand unknowns of the day) is one such mechanism. In our modern culture, a proclivity for conspiracy theorism is another similar trait.

            I tend to think of it like this:Men need explanations for things.  Not just things they don’t understand – but simple things in their daily lives.  Ever since I was a teenager – when i started to become more aware of the world around me and the machinations of my fellow human beings – I have tried to ‘figure things out’.  Part of this wanting to figure things out – came from the realization that people simply don’t explain things to each other a lot of the time.  I think the other part of this – for a lot of men at least – is the desire to figure out WTF it is that women want.  That desire to “figure things out” – is probably hard wired into men.When I was elementary school age  – I had a lot of those Matchbox cars.  But some of my favorite ones were disappearing.  Long story short – I finally came to the conclusion that one of my friends was stealing them from me when we played together.  I didn’t have any proof though – and what I really wanted to do was get the things back.  Even then I knew that if I just accused him of stealing them – it would just turn into a he-said she-said type of situation  – and I’d never get the chance to get those cars back.  So I carefully avoided having him come over and play with my cars for a few months.  Then I came up with some excuse to go over to his house and get into HIS collection and see if my cars were in there.Sure enough – they were – that little fucker had been stealing from me for over a year.  And he was a little fucker too.  By the time we got into high school  I had to beat the hell out of him a couple of times because he was the neighborhood punk.  Lost track of him as we grew up – but I’m pretty sure he ended up in jail.Point here is:  I just couldn’t let it go.  I knew damn well I wasn’t losing them – but I had no plausible explanation for where they were disappearing to.Think of it as detective work.  Some people are very good at it.  Some are extremely bad at it.  Many of the advancements made by Western civilization have rested on the “discoveries” made by one man.  These people were detectives.  They saw something that didn’t make sense – and had to seek an explanation.It’s interesting that you bring up the dancing Israelis thing Zman.  I remember those stories in the news when 9/11 went down.  And I also remember the stories about how hundreds of Israelis were grabbed up and shipped out in the aftermath.  I’ve always let that nugget of info sit in the back of my head and have ALWAYS had a distrust of the official story about 9/11.  Something was going on there – this wasn’t just a random attack that nobody knew about.  That’s my position on this.  The Israeli thing is just too suspicious.People may also remember some of the little story nuggets that popped up after the Boston Marathon bombing.  One of them was a Saudi man who was caught running away from the scene of the bombing.  He got gathered up – brought to the hospital (he was so close he was injured) – and then he was carefully whisked out of the country.That little nugget of info has always made me suspicious that Saudi intelligence was responsible for the Boston attack.  I later made the acquaintance of a member of the Boston PD who was intimately involved in the resulting shennanigans after the bombing – and was in fact there when they grabbed the kid out of the boat.  I ran my suspicions by him – and he agreed.  There was something going on there that the government carefully memory-holed.I tend to think of “conspiracy” theories as just people putting their detective hats on – when it’s plainly clear that the narrative is utter and complete bullshit.  They get crazy sometimes because some people are much better detectives than others.Benghazi is another good example.  AS IT WAS HAPPENING – the news stories were coming out about what was really going on .  Then it was what – a day or a few days later – and the official channels are pushing that bullshit about the guy in CA making a movie that pissed off the Muzzies.AND PEOPLE WERE BUYING IT.Bring up the “facts” that had been somewhat accurately reported just a week beforehand – and you’d get the screams of “Tinfoil!!” being thrown your way.It took what – maybe 2 or 3 years before the truth started to seep out about that – and then they made a movie about it?

                    People are predisposed because we all want someone (ideally powerful) to take care of us—or at least backstop us.  When we are children, it’s mom and dad, but as we mature it’s the government that fills the void for many of us.  To disbelieve the government is to abandon that notion of a powerful and benevolent caretaker—and that’s scary for a large percentage of the population.

Some of us are fully capable of taking care of ourselves – and what we really desire is for all of the incompetents to stop telling us what to do – because their advice has proven out to be incompetent at best and destructive at worst – time and time again.
A grown up adult white male does NOT need a government run by women and POC telling him what to do.

                            Your faction is maybe 10% of all men. Most know that they need State boots on necks otherwise every single person out there will lie, cheat and steal from them and that every decision will be short term profits with no regard  for health, welfare and safetyAs I’ve noted before the main maybe the only  reason the air is breathable and rivers don’t catch on fire is government boots on corporate necksOtherwise, the pressure of the marketplace and simple game theory will ensure that everyone pollute to gain advantageA recent example, California has an annoying bag fee of a dime on plastic bags . Its extra money most of us would rather not pay and its ends up with a lot of bags around the houseThe stated goal was to reduce pollution and you know what, it worked. No one is dumping bags and the amount of trash dropped in public areas went down quite a lot despite a heavily Latino populationThe bags we get are also high quality too which is nice when you go to reuse them.Government like any other tool is neither good nor evil and may work or fail depending on the idea and how its implementedIts best though that it be on your sideThis divide between Our Government and Economic Liberals/Libertarians  is going to plague the Dissident Right for its whole life since the two factions are largely incompatible

                            I wanted to add something, I agree with you on the POC /women rule issues completely.Frankly no one needs those people in charge of anything as passing few of them are competent or capable of running a stable societyIn fairness a huge number of the White males we have selected even back in the “minimal government” days were incompetent and crooked as well.However if you want a society where those sorts don’t have much power you need to repatriate some tens of millions and remove female suffrage.A campaign to remove the 19th however well intended has no chance e through Democratic or Republican means in anyone here’s lifetime

                        I suspect that if you could get them to speak candidly, very few people believe a word the government, media  or big business says  and this crosses racial lines. Blacks are incredibly prone to conspiracy thinking  with more than a little justification.The thing is  the more complex , urban  and interdependent a society is, the less independence is possible . Marx called this alienation from the means of production and like many things in Marxism, right diagnosis, wrong prescriptionNearly all city dwellers are serfs or wage slaves and virtually none of them have the ability to feed themselves or meet any of the basics of life without a a lot of complex interactionsA few blips in the road and there is mass starvation.A battle between some insurgents and the government  in the Philippines displaced half a million people and its estimated repairs will take 20 yearsAnd note you can’t save your way out of it, its ludicrous to assume working class apartment dwellers making just enough to get buy can somehow store 370 gallons of water  and a years supply of food,  medicine and the   essentials per person  in a flat at all times just in case they get laid offGiven that no private charity has the unlimited expansion capacity of government and that no one can guarantee that each citizen has at least the mediocre basics,  the state grows , simply because it can guarantee these thingsThis gets worse with automation. In some sense, every kiosk, every robot , every computer used to automate jobs  makes Democratic voters almost as fast as migrantsLet me use a historically recent US example, the Great Depression to clarifyWith the dust bowl wiping out farms and the yeomanry and the associated economic panic, the rest of the economy, people rationally selected an  authoritarian Left wing state who for all its flaws actually made sure people could eat .And note, there is no way to retain high complexity, high order  and break that cycle.An economic  failure and/or  civil war simply means less complexity as cities and machines and the people who make them fall apart.if you want a yeoman based society, you have to be rid of complexity and concentrate on a agrarian /small business societyI do not think however anyone even in the dissident faction  will sign up to for Right Wing Pol PotThe only way for us to save the system is mass repatriation and a ban on new immigrants along with tight trade controls and a non interventionist foreign policy.Mix in a health patriarchal culture and you can create a somewhat stable social orderGetting that paleocon  system though would not be easy and might require an outright dictator  to do it
