        “Pushed back into his car and assaulted by Brown.”  If true, that’s enough for me, just shoot him.  My daddy taught me not to do that. Ever.
This man’s family and community have taught him from the time he was in Pampers to utterly hate and disrespect the law and those who represent it.  A police sidearm is the only civilising factor in such a neighborhood.

        @bill— True. If he’s an active threat to somebody, you do what you have to. We’ll see if this was that kind of situation

            Tennessee vs. Garner provides an extremely narrow exception and a very high bar for the cops. If they are chasing a guy who clearly has a gun and has used it, then the cops can use deadly force to stop the guy from fleeing. You never know with these cases because the news outlets are trained to lie about important facts, but we know the victim was unarmed. That much has been determined by the cops.

        You never hear a peep when a black cop shoots a black vic. It’s not like it never happens. There is a vid out there after some street disturbance or another showing a black female cop leaving a cluster of cops to walk up to a shirtless Aferican talking smack and dancing the mambo, shooting him point blank in the heart, and walking away. The most amazing thing was that he didn’t notice a thing until a friend told him he’d been shot, at which point he looked down at his wound and dropped dead.

        Cops absolutely can shoot someone in the back, under certain circumstances. See Tennessee vs. Garner, and also Graham v. Conner.

        The first version I heard of the Zimmerman/Martin thing sounded like Zimmerman was obviously guilty. You just don’t know what could emerge about this.
But if he did in fact shoot the kid in the back between few and several times, or any number above zero… It’s very hard to see how there could have been a good reason for that.

        Very fair take.
