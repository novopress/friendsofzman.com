        “The lesson of Iraq should have been that there are no short-term solutions to long-term problems and long-term problems come with long-term costs.”The lesson of Iraq should have been that inventing problems that don’t exist and visiting the most mendacious lies upon a people to enlist to solve it is the road to ruin.America has 65 Million colonizers on its soil that is the majority in several major population centers. They just rose up and openly rioted to defy the enforcement of our national sovereignty and kick them out. They openly waive a foreign flag and announce their intent to conquer 1/3rd of our territory in the name of their race. Americans aren’t even permitted to acknowledge their race. The president of their main homeland openly called upon them as her compatriots to mobilize and cancel the remittance taxes that flow to her coffers and to their compatriots in their homeland. A senator of their homeland held up a map calling for building a wall to buttress the reclamation of the territory we purchased from them after defeating them in war over 150 years ago. They have Congressional representatives in America who openly defy our laws and give speeches in their native tongues admonishing the enforcement of our territorial sovereignty and our federal laws against violent and nefarious crime.This debacle is only one week old, and yet the empire is turned outward trying to regime change a foe 6000 miles away who is no threat to us – at least not if we claim and hold our territory that is buttressed by the world’s two biggest oceans and the most advanced inter-continental nuclear missiles that would annihilate any foe within minutes.The face plant here, on behalf of a people who have and continue to declare themselves a hostile enemy and at the same time the greatest ally and foundational to our existence, is beyond comprehension.Trump should be mobilizing the entirety of the American people to do whatever is necessary to send the tens of millions of invading colonizers home. All talk this week should be Congress mobilizing to tax the remittances to foreign domiciles and end our colonization by doing so. They should earmark that money for paying for legions of American men of pre 1925 stock to purge the homeland of colonizers and criminal gangs of fighting age men.But there is none of that. Instead 500,000 of our supposed most dangerous enemy are going to be here pushing out Americans from Our Universities and installing themselves as a rival elite in our own homeland.I could go on. The lesson of the Iraq war should be obvious. What should be more obvious is the lesson of the last week that our treasonous ruling class seems to care nothing about.

            Beautiful comment.
It really does feel as if the events of the last week have been so blatant that Joe Normie now realizes the state is his enemy and the war is here.

                “,,,so blatant that Joe Normie now realizes…”Ah, if only that was the case. In my experience dealing with these people, family, business contacts … that is just not so.At this point, the propaganda is aimed at such a low level that if there is an audience of people that STUPID … that want to convert their wives and sisters into Gold Star Mothers … or see their sons, legless, living under an overpass as passers-by mutter, ‘thank you for your servive’ as they pitch boins into a hat …… I can’t see any way to stop the death cult of 3rd graders .. there is no port in the storm so as long as I make it so they don’t get my children … fuck them all.

            Outstanding. The crisis is AT HOME, the enemy is inside the gates, openly looting and burning . . . and we are served up another opportunity to change a nation on the other side of Earth into Globohomo Progland II.
Just another betrayal. They’d rather start WW3 than admit that Their Democracy was wrong and is effed.

                Citizen of a Silly Country:It’s do or die time at home.Yesterday [Tuesday June 17th], our local grocery stores ran out of fresh produce [i.e. vegetables], on account of the ICE raids.I corresponded with a number of different Instacart Drivers about it, and they all agreed that the shelves were bare of fresh produce.Personally, I applaud the ICE raids, but empty grocery store shelves are never a good sign.PRO-TIP: Stock up on vitals with long shelf lives, and start re-writing your recipes to exclude fresh produce.I would argue that the ICE-War is vastly more important for Heritage-USA denizens than is any possible Anuddah Shoah for the hook-nosed crowd.But the Summer of 2025 grocery store situation is now starting to feel a lot like the early 2020-COVID lockdowns.And Peeps at /pol/ are starting to ridicule Trump…

        The US is a boxer who can throw a punch but can neither take a punch nor last past the first round or two, at least not against a decent (but not even great) fighter.Therefore, the blueprint for defeating the US has been laid out. Wait us out. Iran seems to understand this and is saying that it will continue the fight if the US gets involved. Trump and the neocons probably think Iran is bluffing. If so, we attack and then we find out.Regardless, it’s a supremely stupid bet on Trump’s part. He wins little but could lose everything. What a chump.

                Yeah, shifting the narrative allows them to hit Iran with some bunker busters and declare victory. Iran says that it will continue with its nuke program and also declares victory – but quietly stops. Everyone is satisfied.
Except Israel. This was always about regime change, never about nukes, which Iran didn’t even want. Will the Israel Lobby allow this kind of peace? I doubt it, but, for once, they may not be able to stop it. Regardless, Trump should jump at it.

                    The most terrifying part? There was absolutely no anticipation of the fierce blowback/rage.
Israel also will declare victory after the boom-boom if they cannot get their American servants to do the dirty work.

                        Sure, but it will be a big loss for Israel. All of the global trends are working against them. Their power relative to Iran’s will fall over time. The US is receding into a regional power. Iran will do more trade with the BRICs. Missile technology works in Iran’s favor.
There’s a reason Israel felt the need to roll the dice now rather than wait.

                            I’ve been writing for a while now that the window is closing for Israel to commit outrages so it will accelerate them. How many wars has Israel lost in recent decades? Three, I think. It has an even bleaker future than the GAE although it will remain an intact ethnostate albeit something of a backwater with nukes for a bit.

                                Yes, an Israel dominated by Orthodox Jews isn’t going to be great – for anyone including Israel. Iran and Saudi Arabia trading with the BRICs will make more independent and less vulnerable to US threats. Finally, US power will continue to wane.
Granted, Israel’s population is growing nicely, but, outside of that, its future looks to be a much less powerful country. It’s not going anywhere, but its ability push around its neighbors if fading. We’re probably witnessing a high-water mark for Israel right now.

                                It’s not 1948 anymore.  The Jews in Israel expect that they’re moving to New York On The Med so how many will bug out when they have to hide out in their bomb shelters several times a month while the power grid fades in and out?  Given a couple years of that the place will be a shell of it’s former self with a bunch of Bibi psycho cases along with the Bearded Bunch who will figure they can get a deal to live in peace if they turn the area over to the Saudis (which they’d be correct).

                            Israel, in the form of Netanyahu, who needs to keep as many plates spinning as possible in his attempt to stave off prison time. It’s amazing–or, rather, appalling– how long Israeli politicos stay in power or remain in opposition, given the blood sport that is Israeli politics. Anyway, I’m a little behind the curve in antagonism toward Israel, but I voted for the frail hope of peace abroad (a/k/a not fighting others’ wars) and the prospect of prosperity and personal liberty at home. OOPS! Trump’s a’ la carte approach to politics and his junking of dealmaking in favor of an ultimatum should give pause to even his most devoted acolytes.

                                I don’t dislike the Jews or israel, nor do I want to lick their boots like so many evangelicals. I dislike the hold it has over what is supposedly the most powerful nation on planet earth. It smells to high heaven. That’s why I’ve been calling the GOP Israel Firsters Uncle Toms lately. The name fits like a glove.

                            Politically, he’s a dead man walking; the IDF has relied on quick wars waged by reservists.

                        I gave JD a little historical lesson about what happened to all the well-heeled Republican suburbs around here after Bush II bumbled into Iraq using the example of Upper Arlington, Ohio on his Twitter feed. JD should be familiar with that town since he went to The Ohio State University which is right next door.After Bush stumbled into Iraq, virtually the same amount of Republicans were pissed about it as what we’ve seen the last few days. I started seeing Democrat campaign signs in those suburbs to a degree never seen before. Those suburbs have gotten progressively more Democrat ever since, no pun intended.They will do the same thing to MAGA if they don’t stop being Israel’s Uncle Toms.

                        Drop it and bounce. Israel will be left to deal with the afterwards; the optics of that will weaken the neocon grip on America.
As streamer Asmongold says, “Trump didn’t like the deal, so he blew up the table.” Asmon also noted Trump’s quiet diplomacy getting agreement from all principals beforehand. Even Russia and China signed on. Iran is a competitor and potential threat to her neighbors, Russia and China stand to gain more in their dealings with us than they can get a gangster theocracy.
Why do you think Hegseth dropped Ukraine? Part of the deal, to Russia’s benefit.

                        Maybe Trump can do that if he has finesse (yeah, yeah, I know) but there is no way Israel can do it. Unless the Israelis get a total victory and regime change, then they have lost and they are doomed. I see absolutely no future for Israel whatever the result of this debacle. And millions of Israelis are ready to vote with their feet and abandon the project.

            “Regardless, it’s a supremely stupid bet on Trump’s part. He wins little but could lose everything. What a chump.”
Maybe he has no choice. Maybe he made a Faustian pact with the Israel Lobby and the deep state to be allowed into power. The first promise he’s going to go back on is: “Read my lips: no more wars.”

                That’s exactly my take. He made a deal within the context of the ongoing conflict among the International Jews, siding with the Israel-First faction against the Rothschild/Blackrock faction. That’s why he was so dismissive of Gabbard. It didn’t matter if she was correct. He made a deal and HAD to satisfy his end of the bargain in good faith.My problem is that it is clear that what he wanted out of the deal was a chance to save ‘the country’ rather than the chance to save OUR PEOPLE and the rest of the European nations. I don’t give a goddamn rat’s ass about ‘the country’ which has become a Judeopuritan progressive abomination.

                    Trump has been a diehard Zionist his entire life. He didn’t have to “make a deal.” He’s a believer. Look who his daughter married — into the Kushner crime family. Look who he pardoned last term — when it wasn’t black thugs it was Jewish criminals. Epstein was one of his best friends.

        The Ukraine game isn’t over folks. Iran is just the halftime show. The second half starts soon. Russia is up a touchdown and starting to wear down the blue/yellow defense. Yes, the Ukraine “trick play” worked on the bombers, but the stats show the Russian yardage advantage. Anything longer than a Super Bowl is beyond our national attention span anyway. Nobody will be watching until the Russians roll up to the Dnieper and Trump has to make some tough decisions. And now, a message from Pfizer…

            Five years ago this war wouldn’t have happened:
1) Russian military was assumed to be much more powerful, especially after their defeat of ISIS in Syria.2) Iran’s army was assumed to be much more powerful, especially after they helped Russia defeat ISIS in Syria.3) Nobody thought Israel could seriously cripple Hezbollah within a matter of days.4) Everyone assumed Russia would step in to defend a key ally (Iran) like they did with Assad.

        They have more missiles and drones than Iran has attack missiles and air defense.I think you meant “Israel” there.A noticeable shift has happened over the last twelve hours. “Nikki” “Haley,” the most serpentine, stupid Israel shill imaginable, just posted that Iranian regime change is not a goal, and implying it is not even possible. Her message: take out the nuke sites! This is where this is probably heading.My guess is the normal narrative magic not only backfired but stirred up a lot of latent, fully justified anti-Israel sentiment. The Tucker interview with Ted Cruz, in addition to being amusing, laid bare the utter ignorance of those supposedly in charge, and might have actually mattered. Narratives have a hard time when confronted by reality these days.The fierce blowback may have saved Trump from a historically stupid betrayal, which likely means he will crack down on X and the friends who criticized the Iranian war. Of course, the toxic blend of senility and retardation may lead him to revert to the original intention to join the war and torch whatever remains of the political movement he started, but that seems less likely as of five minutes ago.The GAE is in a new era regardless.

            Yeah, they’ll switch the narrative to taking out the nuke sites, then hit Iran with some bunker busters and declare victory.The big question is whether Iran plays along. Will Iran just admit defeat. Not a great look. Iran could say that they will continue to work on their nuclear program – and thus they’ve won – but quietly stop. The US says Iran is do debilitated that their program doesn’t matter and also declares victory – again. Probably the best outcome.However, that’s not what Israel wants. Iran never wanted nukes. This whole thing was about regime change. My scenario doesn’t achieve that. Will the Israeli Lobby allow this? Maybe, for once, they won’t get what they want in Congress.

                The problem long term is Congress doesn’t matter. The intelligence services will continue to play fuck-fuck games one way or the other. Even more than AIPAC, the IC is the biggest cancer on the republic now. I do think bombing and a declaration of victory has become the decided narrative, though.

                    The IC can try, but as I’ve mentioned, historical trends are working against Israel and the US IC.Iran will get stronger via trade with the BRICs. Our sanctions will be less debilitating by the year. As our military power wans, the IC and Israel are left with only color revolutions, but those are more difficult since 1) everyone has learned how to deal with them and 2) more prosperous regimes are far, far less vulnerable.Basically, the world is moving on. The way that you beat Jews and the US is disengagement. Don’t let them into your life and have a military strong enough to keep them at bay.

                        Agreed. It almost is unfathomable even now how much is beyond the US’s direct control. The IC–really, the entirety of the Anglosphere’s IC–has essentially been its own quasi-autonomous rogue government a long time. I can see it retaining marginally more power than the governments it ostensibly serves. There’s been a lot lost in the noise of the last few days, but it has been confirmed that China did help manipulate the 2020 election, and, even worse, the IC sat on that information. My guess is it subcontracted the job.

                            ‘The IC–really, the entirety of the Anglosphere’s IC–has essentially been its own quasi-autonomous rogue government a long time’
Intel has directed the deep state bureaucracies at least since ’63, as we were discussing yesterday. They are the permanent government. They red-pen Hollywood, they control info ingress and egress. They paint the picture.
Mostly a combo of U.S. and Brit ‘services’, I’d guess. They really are sister nations.

                Maybe Iran will do some kind of deal, but I don’t see it. They seem to have a slither of ascendency right now, and Putin and Lavrov will tell them that you don’t do deals when you are in the front seat. Also, what deal could they make? If they sign something, Israel and the US will back in a year’s time with more “demands”.

            Anyone who thinks that it will just stop at a bunch of bunker busters is just fooling themselves. Obviously the Lobby and the neocons and Israel are working hard to tell us that it’s no big deal if we just give them what they want, it’s just a few missiles, they’ll take care of it, then it will be over, don’t you want peace? We’ve literally gone through this exact rigamorale for centuries. “Hey, no need to get involved in the war, just lease Britain and the USSR some weapons.” I mean, COME ON.FFS, we can’t fall for this yet again. “Nikki” “Haley” would not be suggesting this if she didn’t know that it was the path to get what her benefactors want, which is total regime change war with Iran and the mop-up operation afterwards and tens of millions of Muslim refugees in the west. I see stuff like this and I see normies falling for it and I think the Jews are right, we really are cattle.

                But that’s where it is heading, bombing and a quick announcement of victory. Reality–including the ability to produce arms–will be the deciding factor. “Nikki” “Haley” indeed is doing what she has been told, and that’s to take down the anti-Israel temperature a notch.

                    The only reason we are talking about bunker busters now is because Israel’s “decapitation” aggression strike failed. They tried to declare victory afterwards and were triumphant in the media… until missiles started raining down on Haifa and Tel Aviv.
What happens when bunker busters fail? Remember Israel is the one in control here.

                            Then Iran retaliates enough to drag us into a 20 year quagmire.  I’m sure the Israelis have thought this far ahead.  Bog down the US in a long war, drain its treasury and feed off its husk, while keeping their mortal enemy in a box.  It’s a great plan, assuming their bribes are enough to keep our politicians betraying America.

                        They will lie about the bunker bomb results one way or another. And as Z just posted, second order consequences ceased to be a consideration long ago.
This is shaping up to the the GAE’s Suez Crisis although that never will be the narrative.

                        That’s the big question, isn’t it. Trump drops some bunker busters, Iran refuses to buckle, both declare victory and look to end this.
But Israel wants regime change. Indeed, Israel needs regime change because historical trends are working against it. The US is getting relatively weaker. Iran is getting stronger with BRICS. Missile technology favors Iran. Israel gets weaker day by day relative to Iran.
It has to be now.

If anything should give you pause, that is it. I’m no fan of Israel, but I positively loathe academic administrators/profs and so should you. And if your views align with theirs you should probably rethink them.

            Even if Trump limits this to a perfunctory deep penetration bunker-buster vs a nuke site it still may blow up horribly in his face. Serbs bagged a stealth fighter, the Iranians could bag a stealth bomber. A B-2 going down in flames would be a mess.

        The problem is that neocons think they’re smarter and better than everyone else. It’s in their DNA and they cannot change.You can give them a tour of underground Iranian bases or Russian military accomplishments and they’ll go home and say those countries are backward. Until neocons are purged from every decision making process, this will continue and the rest of the world will suffer.

                China and Russia were roaring in laughter and shouting, ‘More!’.
Their military parades feature huge swathes of hard, war-ready men marching in perfect order.
New Amerika’s parades feature entitled princesses taking selfies of each other and fat, clueless homos.  Their daddies are SO proud of them!
The nation’s leaders are sure they’ll be just fine in combat because, hey, they fight great in the movies!

            You’re falling for the psyop. The initial leftist talking point was “Trump can’t have a military parade, that makes him a fascist!” When that didn’t work, they shifted to “look how slovenly our military looks. The 75th Ranger Regiment can’t march in step!” as if the Rangers actively devote any time at all to drill and ceremony. The Armydoeshave several units whose sole duty is D&amp;C (Pershing’s Own, the Old Guard) and they excel at it beyond any other nation’s counterparts. Yammering on about how the most lethal infantry unit in the world are walking down the road in route-step march instead of like wind-up toys is what all of the NPCs are doing.The Sukholinov effect states that the military with the most ornate uniforms (which I’d extend to prowess at conducting dog-and-pony shows) always loses. Likewise, the 29th and 30th items on Murphy’s Laws of Combat Operations is that no combat ready unit has ever passed inspection and no inspection ready unit has ever passed combat. The US has always had a reputation for being scrappy and “undisciplined” compared to our European counterparts. It’s something we used to be proud of.

                Bullshit. I was a United States Marine when that meant something. I could fucking march like a champion and handle a 240G machine gun. They were not mutually exclusive, because both involved discipline and pride, which the Army has none of anymore.

        This is the moment, the dividing line where MAGA finds out what side Trump is on. There have been other times where Trump sided with the Global American Regime over MAGA, such as the experimental mRNA shots, and “bringing more legal immigrants than ever before,” but this is the big one that MAGA can’t ignore like the others.

            I wonder about the psychological after-effects of this. Trump has immense symbolic power to tens of millions of people. In their minds, his victory was a vindication of American liberal democracy, in that — for once — their preferences were triumphant in a national election. It will not happen again in their lifetimes, and he represented, more or less, their last, best chance.As you say, his betrayal will be impossible to ignore. It will entail confronting a very ugly truth that many others have known for much longer, and were far better prepared to accept than Joe Normie. Once it becomes evident thatthis was it, there is no one coming to save them, I have to wonder how a very unstable, angry citizenry will handle that lesson.

                I’m sure Trump will lose a portion of his base, but I think the majority will just memory-hole the betrayal or get right on board with the latest middle east adventure. I’ve heard it from friends and family. They “don’t want war” with Iran, but they think we need to go destroy their nuclear facilities. To them, Iran is trying to get a bomb because they want to nuke the US. Trying to explain to them that this is not a movie just doesn’t register. It is like arguing with Fox news.

                    I saw a full court press on X from anons, likely a lot of bots, to rally support. All the expected propaganda, calling people who opposite it third-worldists and brown, the “I don’t trust some MAGA grifter, I trust TRUMP” stuff, etc. They’re going to try to lump people like me who oppose it with the dirty hippies on the left and it’s probably going to work.Are people falling for it? I saw one post about a poll about 75% of peope being opposed to Iran’s nuclear program, up 51 points. Where were these people ten years ago when Trump ripped up the JCPOA? this is how easy it is for these neocons and warmongers to get normies on their side.

                        It’s embarrassing how easy it is to fool people. I had a conversation with a normie about how Iran has allegedly been trying to get nukes for 40 years. I asked him if he thought it was really that hard for a country that produces more engineers than we do (not counting all the foreigners we degree) to develop a nuke? I proded a bit- do you think maybe there might be something more at play here than Iran is just about to get nukes? And even if they are, why do you assume Iran immediately begins shooting them into US cities? He just spouted exactly what you get from Fox news and ghouls like Cruz and Graham. “Of course Iran wants to kill us! They hate us for our freedom!”There’s just no getting through to these people.

                        Pakistan having nukes is a pretty solid argument that Iran having them wouldn’t end in world annihilation. You’ll notice the difference between the two countries is not its Muslim extremism- it’s the direct proximity to Our Greatest Little Friend.

                I’m going out on a limb here, but if the neocons go to war for Israel against Iran, Trump will not finish his term. After seeing his social media diarrhea the last couple weeks, I seriously question his fitness for office. He may not be much better than Biden was. He seems to be in the senior citizen anger and rage phase before his mind starts to go really fast.Vance is far from perfect but at least he isn’t a candidate for the nursing home. He also hopefully is someone who just goes through the motions of Israel support because he had to not because he’s a true believer.

Vance is a globohomo neocon/neolib because he hates you and wants you to die. He’s smart enough to pretend otherwise, sometimes. Not this week. He leaped to the front of the “regime-changing Iran is a core premise of MAGA” messaging brigade because this war willkill your children.
He values nothing else.

                    Sick of the constant B.S. “Neville Chamberlain = appeasing coward” comparisons. Britain was in no condition to take on Hitler in 1938. They weren’t even ready in 1940. What was Nev supposed to do? He sought to buy time to rearm. Nobody wanted to relive the horrors of WW1.

        Virtually all wars throughout history (to include Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) were begun by people who thought victory would be quick and/or easy. There are not very many exceptions. What distinguishes the GAE is its predilection for finding someone new to make war on, whether directly or by proxy, every 5-10 years, save for a brief window post-Vietnam in which it mostly gave it a rest (but still couldn’t resist Grenada and sending the jarheads to Beirut).The distinguishing feature of the current dustup with Iran, relative to other GAE wars, is how little effort was put into persuading the public ahead of time.And how no casus belli was manufactured (yet).As if they don’t even care anymore what we think. They are just nakedly admitting that we are going to war because Israel says so, so shut up peasant.

It’s shocking, really. The vast majority of Americans are vociferously against a war, and yet they are bald-faced in their indifference.
I’m thinking ‘they were always this way’ except nobody was paying attention before.  When you look at old news footage it’s just as transparently obvious. Maybe it’s just that too many of us have had our ‘they live’ moment for the BS to work anymore.

                I think it has sunken in with a lot of people that our greatest ally sicced Jeffrey Epstein on us (with our intelligence looking the other way) and was controlling our government. Most normies haven’t figured it out yet, but enough people know.

                    Did you notice the lockstep “conservative influencer” talking points after Musk said Trump was in the Epstein files. The reality, however, is that Trump being in the Epstein files is the most plausible accusation of almost anyone on Earth short of Prince Andrew:
Devon Stack goes into great detail how very close Trump and Epstein were for more than 15 years at the height of Epstein’s trafficking activities:

Remember, Trump was President when Epstein “killed himself.”

            I’ve been somewhat surprised, although I should not have been, at the absolutely no explanation for Israel’s attacks. The assumption is that they just get to do whatever they want. Casus belli? You’re just supposed to assume that Iran got too close to the bomb, so Israel just had to strike. It should be jaring for normie to see the lack of any explanation contrasted with years of getting lectured how Russia had absolutely NO reason to attack Ukraine. It should lay bare we are being dog-walked by these people; just a coincidence that Syria got toppled, Gaza is getting cleansed, and oh we just had to strike Iran.

                    Not defending Israel, asking where is its justification. Russia has outlined its issues repeatedly for the special military operation. Maybe you can enlighten us on the casus belli Israel has used to justify its actions? Make sure to cite current examples, not old declarations that Iran can never have access to nukes. Israel didn’t plan these attacks last week. So why are we not being at least told a story about how Iran was JUST ABOUT TO BREAK THROUGH? They don’t even bother to offer an excuse, which is something if you think about it.

                        Big Serge did a good piece about this recently – the idea of “preventative wars” to avoid fighting an enemy later in a less advantageous position. The example he used was Operation Barbarossa. How Germany believed the clock was ticking on an inevitable conflict with the USSR, and that by striking in summer 1941 they could deliver the knockout blow before the Soviets before Stalin had built up enough strength to take on the Nazis.

                            You are confusing a tactic/strategy with a reason/cause.  Yes, the tactics/strategy are similar in a way (pre-emptive strike of sorts although Uke had been attacking the Donbass repeatedly).  But in Russia’s case, there was the Maidan coup, violation of prior agreements, and ongoing persecution/attacks on ethnic Russians.  Israel had . . . crickets.  In fact, it was Israel/US that had been conducting ongoing attacks on Iran with measured (some would say weak) responses from Iran.  So, no, the situations are not the same.

        I think the issue with Trump is who flatters him and talks to him last. We can only hope JD Vance or Tulsi is the last person to talk to him about Iran when the final decision is made.There are no advantages to our involvement in Iran. If we do “regime change,” Iran will degenerate into another failed state like Libya or Syria which will create a “refugee” crisis that will be flowing into Europe.We’ve been told since the 1990s that Iran was close to a bomb and it was an “existential” threat to Israel. If the mullahs were as mad as our media and their Israeli masters say they are, wouldn’t they have nuked Tel Aviv by now?We are $36 trillion in debt. We can’t afford a decades-long commitment to “nation-building” in a nation where we destroyed the government and the infrastructure in the name of regime change, democracy, gay pride parades or whatever emotive BS our rulers can imagine.

            The difference now is that Trump really seems to be war-drunk. His comments the past 24-48 hours are genuinely disturbing. He’s getting support from everyone who has hated him the past six months, all telling him how brave and courageous he is to take part in this. He’s obviously loving it. It’s like all the worst instincts of this guy are being leaned on simultaneously by the worst people to follow the worst course of action. Guys like Tucker tried to reach out and he called him a kook, and Tucker has talked him down from this lunatic neocon ledge in the past.

Well, the same as for Iraq and Afghanistan: demand globalism and egalitarianism, install feminism and female supremacy, celebrate homosexuality and LGBTQ on a mass level, and turn Iran into the County Mall . . . though the County Mall closed down twenty years ago and is now a vacant eyesore on the land.
Do I want Nancy Pelosi, Kathy Hochul and the Ghermezian brothers running Iran, or the Ayatollah?  Give me the Big Bearded Dood for $100, Alex!  Mullah mullah!

        The comparisons to Pearl Harbor by the blob is disingenuous, at least the way they mean it.  Pearl Harbor was not a surprise sneak attack.  They knew it was coming because they are the ones who provoked it.  The public was pretty unified against joining the war. FDR did everything he could to provoke a declaration of war from Germany by illegally arming and feeding Germany’s enemies.  They wanted to provoke Hitler into using U-boats to sink these illegal shipments.  But Hitler wouldn’t fall for it.  We’re playing the same stupid word games today with Russia and Ukraine.  “We’re not a belligerent” while arming the Ukrainians and assisting them with technology and logistics on a day to day basis.They did the same thing with Japan.  At first they didn’t respond, but then America just kept upping the ante until she finally responded.

FDR moves to make sure the White nations in the Pacific aren’t turned into Japanese rape colonies and that’s the thanks he gets.

        Some people never learn. The only way to impose one’s will on an enemy is to crush them and take over their land. Germany only submitted after the Soviets, British and American occupied every square inch of their territory. Turning all their cities to rubble made no difference at all.The Japanese submitted only after nuclear weapons were used on them, as well as the entire might of the allies heading towards their islands.It doesn’t matter how many bombs, missiles and drones are dropped on Iran, or how many mullahs and generals are killed. They will not submit to force, unless it is on the scale of invasion and full occupation. I doubt even dropping a couple nukes on them would do the job, unless a full invasion force was ready to follow it.N-E-G-O-T-I-A-T-I-O-N. It seems the U.S. forgot that word after the Cold War, except as a dishonest ruse.

            Occupying a nation of 90+ million is no easy feat, especially when they’re all politically unified…againstthe occupiers. Iraq devolved into a civil war between Shia and Sunni that the US was essentially playing referee for. That’s not going to happen in Iran. They have the population size of all of Western Europe and, unlike Germany after WWII, they are not above complex insurgency actions. The kind that wear down and attrit an occupying force with surprising rapidity. This is the kind of hybrid warfare that the US dealt with in Korea and Vietnam to a certain extent. In Korea we settled for a stalemate, and that was when we were arguably at our apex (compared to the rest of the world) in terms of quality of troops and technological advantage. We also had the full cooperation and support of the area we were occupying and operating out of. Iran would be a combination of all of the worst aspects of every war the US has been in for the past 75 years.

                It would be an abject disaster that would make the Iraq debacle look like a brilliant move. And anything short of an existential threat to our homeland would not justify its undertaking. But that’s what’s worrisome, I wouldn’t put it past our parasitic leadership class to actually do it.

                IMHO they are likely to employ their Syria Strategy.   That is use influence to attract Sunnis from around the world to go to Iran and make war like they did with their ISIS brigades.
However Iran also has a lot of militia groups so it may not be so easy.

        If you haven’t seen this video, it’s worth a look. It reveals the missile resources that Iran has stockpiled in subterranean tunnels, and most of these missile complexes include a mobile launcher. This means they can be dispersed widely and will be almost impossible to find and interdict in mountainous areas; just like as was the case in Afghanistan. Bet on Iran to outlast the US and Israel. How stupid we have become. This insanity will not end until we have financial collapse.

            You can’t win a war from the air. That’s been proven time and time again. At some point you need to bring in infantry to fight the enemy and beat them. Even though the IDF has been very good at blowing up women and babies, the diaper brigades have not performed well against Hamas. This is why Hamas is around and nobody, not even Netanyahu, pretend like they defeated Hamas. It is how a bunch of guys in tents were able to beat the mighty US Navy that spent billions of dollars to shoot at them.So, this idea that we will beat Iran by dropping bombs is just as stupid as the idea that the IDF will beat Hamas by dropping bombs. Actually it’s much more stupid because Iran is huge, rugged, mountainous, and in charge of its own country and resources.

                “You can’t win a war from the air.”
It was ~2-3? months ago a joint Israeli-American (sponsored? how many mercs? how many state contracted?) commando group went into Yemen presumably on a missile launcher hunt, and were killed to the last man. The pool of men capable of being trained to that level is not large, and it takes years to develop skills, so this was not a small loss.

                        I think they were 0% effective. They were slaughtered immediately. The story I read included conjecture (almost certainly correct) that Russian Federation satellites tracked their insertion plane before it entered Yemeni airspace and allowed Yemenis to efficiently vector in on them.It’s entirely plausible in that our DC apparatchiks have grown stupid and arrogant fighting subpeer enemies. Why would the Russians NOT help Yemen give globohomo a black eye? We are not only not their technological superior anymore, I don’t even think we can claim to be a peer, in military technology at least, but these morons still think it’s 1991.

        The Pentagon has wargamed a war with Iran a couple of times, and the results have been uniformly bad for the US military…Any carriers in the vicinity get sunk, and there’s no way the Army can get traction without huge casualties…Now Iran has powerful allies in Russia, China and the Norks, and is already getting supplies and armament from them…China is highly dependent on Iranian oil and won’t quit…Economically, Iran closing the Strait and probably the Houthi closing the Red Sea will result in a total disaster for the West, with $200/bl oil, maybe higher…I just can’t see any way that such a war won’t be a disaster for Trump, and his base is strongly opposed to it…

                I am no expert but if I were Xi or Putin:  I would get a bag of popcorn and a beverage of choice.   Then I would call Trump and basically say, Oh please Mr. Trump! Don’t throw us into the briar patch with you committing to regime change in Iran.Then quietly and covertly supply Iran with material and support that is just enough to keep them going.   Then proceed to bleed the U.S. dry.   In a few years when the U.S. is forced to conduct a horrible withdrawal like Afghanistan, you send in your ready made regime to take over.

                    Russia seems to be stretched to the limit in Ukraine. They didn’t help clients in Syria and Armenia recently: can they really help Iran?
China can just wait on the sidelines, supply the belligerents and get rich. Can they project force? Can they risk being cut off from American and European markets, not to mention the rest of Asia? They haven’t committed a single soldier to help Russia in the Ukraine – unlike US/EU with all our “advisors”.

                        Why do they need to project force?.  The Uke war was supposed to “bleed” Russia, and it has a little bit.  But it has bled the US/EU a lot – mostly in money/supplies, a little in personnel sent over on the down low.  So who is bleeding whom?  Why would China stop the self-destruction of the US when the US is doing a damn good job of it on its own?
Look what “projecting force” has gotten the US – bankruptcy.  And each day, it is more projecting farce than force.

        Part of the problem is the complete collapse in competence of our senior defense personnel, uniformed and civilian. The US military used to be a bastion of defense against the International Jew, as catalogued by Joseph Bendersky in his 2000 “The Jewish Threat.” He wrote from the point of view that they were all racists and that there was no IJ problem. Here we are a quarter century later and his premise, his prerequisite notion that WASP resistance to the IJ was racist and illegitimate, is transparently ridiculous.Bendersky writing this book was a staggering own goal. It is a beautiful recitation of our ancestors’ righteous resistance to genocidal evil. It’s unfortunate that what passed for a ‘right’ in last century’s American political sphere was merely corporatist and hence not genuinely ethnonationalist, and thus did not have the support of the American working class, because there should have been a military coup against the traitor Roosevelt and his communist cadres. This is yet another datum in the large record against the desirability of having a merchant ruling class. If one’s only value is money, then one will always be a whore to whoever controls instantiation of currency.Resistance among people they could not simply buy motivated the Jews to make capture of Congress a high priority. We can see now how successful they have been, with 95% of Senators and Representatives willingly if not enthusiastically accepting of AIPAC operatives on their staffs. Jewish control of the House committee controlling promotion of colonels to generals ensured that, over time, the senior ranks were denuded of both people with propensity to defend America and of people with significant talent. (1) It’s dangerous to have capable slaves if you fear that they might figure out the state of play and decide to do something about it. Obedient and corrupt clown trash are safer but less capable servants.Progress on the civilian side I think was much quicker, because senior civilians can be simply appointed, but most Jewish operatives were not willing to serve in someone else’s military for 20 years simply on the chance that they might get power, and with the surety that the chance mandated 20 years of lost earnings in the private sector. So they had to modulate our promotion system to ensure that our most odious clown trash rose to the top, instead of being weeded out as occurred in previous times.(1) I remember seeing a study on IQ’s of officer candidates by year cohort. We used to recruit smart officers, and there used to be ~4% really high flyers, genuine genius level men. Now, junior officer IQ is only marginally higher than the enlisted (2 points iirc?), and the high flyers are COMPLETELY gone. The kind of young men who can grow into exceptionally capable warfighters or military industrial planners are simply not in the pipeline.

        Just started watching the interview in the link. Two sane guys trying to figure out what the heck is going on inside the spinning fruit salad bowl of weirdness that is the minds of the people making decisions these days. Valiant though you may try you are never going to understand what drives these people including Trump. You simply do not have the necessary prerequisites; you’re not effing nuts. Sane people will never “get” what it’s like inside a narcissist psychosis.That said, I hope America dodges a war with Iran. When you have cancer, you don’t need a heart attack on top

        “Which one does he choose?”A rhetorical question surely. Which one does a rash and impulsive man surrounded by shameless sycophants, and not given to strategic thought, self-doubt and introspection choose? My money is that Trump will rush in where angels fear to tread.I agree with the rest of your essay and for what it’s worth my sympathies are with the Iranians. At the same time I can’t help thinking they have been guilty of missteps. They should never have trusted the USA, they should probably not have allowed in the inspectors, and most importantly they should have had a more paranoid and belligerent stance, as I said a couple of days back. I think Hua Bin was arguing (on Unz) that you can’t prevail just by defending, even if you’re stronger compared to your opponent. It has to be a mix of attack and defence. The Iranians have just been reacting. Too many Tom Hagens there. With Trump on the other hand, we possibly have another Santino Corleone as someone was writing a few days back:https://morgoth.substack.com/p/america-and-the-sonny-corleone-trap

            There isn’t going to be a ground invasion of Iran. Nobody has the troops (never mind the logistical train). Looks to me like the same clever guys who convinced themselves that sanctions would topple Putler have now convinced themselves that some mix of sanctions and bombing will topple the mullahs. The next big question to be answered is how much more directly and openly involved the GAE is going to get.

                        I should have said no US/Israeli ground invasion (even after a US asset is hit). But there could be a proxy army lined up that we don’t know about. Azerbaijan?

        In the old days, when a President decided on war, he would address the nation and explain the reasons. Both the Bushes did that. It was still understood that war is not undertaken lightly, and that the general public deserved to hear an argument, some rationale, that bore a relationship to the national interest. And let’s admit it, a lot of us here fell for it in those halcyon days when we thought we were the good guys…They don’t even bother nowadays. All the proxy warfare with Russia through Ukraine – despite its terrifying ramifications – never explained, never defended, never justified. Nuclear war just became one of those “shit happens” conversations, like it has no connection to the national interest, or the interest of everyday people, or humanity in general.So now our man Trump seems to have joined the queue. It’s all so tiresome – and disappointing. A mantra among “us” has been:I won’t give up on BOM yet!For nine stinking years.Yeah, this Iran thing has me black-pilled as regards “Donaldus Magnus”. The main challenge internationally to the survival (and possible revival) of this thing we call AINO comes from Mexico. Why not commit “regime change” efforts there, plus 250,000 troops?We all know why. Because AINO, too, is a failed state. Trump can no more save this nation than Majorian – my favorite late Roman emperor – could save the western Empire.

        Yesterday I was in the office. I work with a LOT of Iranian exiles. FWIW, this is what I was told.My co-workers had called their family in Iran. Their families are scared, but hopeful the Regime will collapse. The Regime is hated because it was both corrupt and repressive. I was reminded of the several overthrow attempts during the Obama years of large crowds of young people tired of the twin corruption and repression. They could stomach the one but not the other. [Note, this is a sample sized selected out of exiles, so make of this what you will].I was reminded, and had been told this several years ago by other Iranian exiles I know outside the company I work for; that Khamenei’s grand daughter lives in Orange County not too far from me. Drives a Lamborghini, has body guards. Khamenei himself is worth at least $200 billion, owns hotels in Moscow, also meat packing plants in Russia, various importers, etc. And has stashed cash not just with his grand daughter but other relatives in the UK, Monaco, Brazil, and Singapore.The Regime is probably a lot weaker than many here think, and stronger than Israel and neo-cons think. However, Assad just suddenly collapsed. Fled to Moscow. I would not rule that out with Iran’s regime. Serbia just collapsed under the bombing campaign.I think cynically that both the US and Russia/China want the air war to go on as long as possible. The US is testing via Israel the concept of lots and lots of JDAMS and similar bombs doing stand-off bombing the way Russia has but not this scale in Ukraine. To see if that brings the cost down and tempo up to meet missile offense. The Russians want to see how large scale missile attacks fare against anti-missile attacks by air; if it is possible AT SCALE to shoot and scoot or not. This has implications for not just Ukraine, but also Taiwan, and other areas.Neither Iran nor Israel can invade each other; too much distance and other nations makes that impossible. They can each pound each other’s cities into rubble, but Iran has a disadvantage that Israel does not. Israel can jettison Bibi and fight on without any fuss; Iran cannot jettison Khamenei who is 86 years old; without Regime collapse. And the Regime requires enforcers who must be paid and live well enough to remain enforcers instead of immavasion refugees. Assad collapsed reportedly because his soldiers had not been paid for nearly a year; saw no reason to fight for a doomed regime, and fled.[Note, I would be personally shocked if Iran did not already have at least 10-20 nuke warheads, integration with missiles that work is another thing. The UK and France have not nuked Russia because they have about 75, 400 respectively, while Russia has 6,000. So even though “save Zelensky” neither the Islamic Republic of Britain nor the one in France will nuke Russia. Same thing with Iran.]Lastly, the WSJ is now pulling back on their Trump hate, remarkably. Its still there for “there shall be open borders” but far less. Trump is getting some Judges to rule his way for a change on deportations and other things. His approval ratings are up substantially (so was George W. Bush’s at the start of the Iraq War though).Question for everyone here: would you trade an Air War against Iran that lasts years for mass deportations? That seems to be the “deal” Trump has made. I honestly don’t know my answer. I would have given a YES about ten years ago. Now I am not so sure anymore.

            My second job at age 15 was bussing tables at a mexican restaurant. There were a couple of Iranian waiters who the customers mistook for Mexicans. There’s really not much difference is there. And yes I would take that deal. But I’d be astonished if it’s on offer.

                The rumor always was that Team B would do what they could to save Classical America, but in return Classical America had to save Israel (thus the additional thought that Bibi jumped the gun way, way before Trump had sufficient cache to pull it off).

                In the early Eighties I was finishing up my B.A. at a cheap state uni. Vets were given an option of working in the little V.A. Affairs Office on campus, for a small salary additional to their equally small V.A. educational benefit (upon which I lived).One day I enter the office and there are two ME-looking doods staffing my desk. Uh, what unit are you boys from say I. ‘Persia’ was their answer. Unediicated me, I didn’t know ‘Persia’ was a country, much less an asset of the U.S. armed forces.Couple months later the women careerists that ran the Admin. Office decided — unilaterally — to close our little vet office due to the piddling monies paid to vets. They did it to show us who’s boss.A bunch of fat, resentment-soaked hags living well off guaranteed state gigs, NONE of whom had put their asses on the firing line or spent one day in uniform.I should have fled that evil bitch of a nation right then, and asked God to burn it down. Took me a few more decades of being likewise kicked around to figure the place out.

                        That sounds about right, four hundred a month mebbe. It stretched pretty far in 1981. I rode my motorcycle all over the bay area and that kept expenses low.
I think the vet office paid us another 80 or 100 a month for mebbe 15 hrs, which was a big deal to those of us staffing the place.

                Yes.  We will never get mass deportations with the current system.   If mass deportations ever come it will be after the entire system collapses and most of those “deportations” will be into the ground.

        Netanyahu launched the attack the day after he survived a parliamentary-collapse vote in the Knesset. It seems the purpose of the current conflict is justifying a continued state of emergency. Why would Netanyahu even want an exit strategy in that context?

        Short-termism is a hard-wired feature of American culture – and has been for decades.  Having worked with expat American corporate managers, one of the things that lands on Day One is a high-speed, low-drag dynamism that is considered a prized feature, not a bug.  “Get ‘er done by close of business!” is their mantra.Reflective thinking, deep strategy and cultivating the Art of the Long View is not their forte – hell, these practices are considered incapacities, symptoms of indecisiveness.Once you understand this endearing quality, it’s possible to run rings around Billy-Bob Hardass-Tablethumper.  Just string things along, let the dude get tangled up in a plethora of unimportant but urgent issues.  Glug, glug.  Choke, choke.

        Well all too true, Z. As an established pattern I’d say you’re spot on as usual. What is it now? 10 years of dissidence and rabble rousing for you now? It’s had its affect: I am hearing old geriatrics and clueless grillers that now sound more like you – than you do!!! The word is getting out, everyone is noticing the patterns except the lunatics and retards, and the jews know it and are shitting bricks. Patterns hold until they break.We can’t keep doing this.I am not ready to commit to an opinion on the future yet. Trump loves surprises… and he may well surprise us yet. He probably isn’t going to save America but he is a promising step in the right direction.

        I guess we have our answer about how Trump was allowed to “win” the presidency. Block all domestic reforms with the kritarch layer, have congressional Israeli puppets sit on their hands, and get him to shovel our children and future into the insatiable Israeli furnace. There is no America to save. At least 90% of the population opposes being Israel’s murder machine yet again, probably 50% are ready to do so using whatever means they have to. I think we are about to see what happens in a country with something like 400 million rifles in private hands and the enforcers living and raising families among the people they will be ordered to murder, enslave or oppress as pressure and resistance escalates.

        Hmmm …. Ayatollah of both Rock and Rollah, Khamenei, gave a speech warning the US that it will never surrender, and that the US faces total destruction if it helps Israel. I am getting weird Khadaffi “Line of Death” vibes, or Baghdad Bob. Khamenei admitted Iran was caught off guard. There have been repeated massive security breaches for years by the Israelis, to the point where the Security Forces seem to be very compromised in some way. Senior Leadership (what remains) must be concerned that lower ranks might be so frustrated that they make a deal with Israelis to become top dogs. Since no one is infused with Islamic Revolutionary Fervor when the Senior guys all own distilleries in Russia.Iran has threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz, but they did that in 1988 in retaliation for the US supporting Saddam. Reagan sank the Iranian Navy and blew apart some oil rigs used as missile bases and that was that. It would probably be significantly harder now but even our debased military is probably better than Iran’s as the landscape is far more flat than Yemen is my understanding.

                but they are not murdered and their one eye isn’t taken out if they do show their own hair. They even can stop being orthodox without fear of their lives.

        Trump has to be careful to avoid spreading our resources too thinly. We can’t be involved in every war. Right now, Iran is the bigger problem. Taking out Khomeini could lead to bigger problems, like who or what will replace his regime? It seems bunker busters are the best way, and it needs to be done ASAP.

            Best-case scenario all round is probably a military strongman like Sisi in Egypt. Remember how Obama/Kerry sorted that one out after the Durka-Durka Spring got out of hand?
