        That is the rule of thumb for the reader. If there is no mention of race it is the race. I see small acts of resistance now and again around the country. A reporter will follow the race guidelines but include a statement from a relative of a perp, for example, in the video.
I expect also that business interest in Lauderdale beach don’t want it widely known that they have organized race riots every summer, sorta like an African spring break.

        Should the police be interested in prosecuting any of those involved, it wouldn’t be too hard. The unmentionable individuals have everything documented blow-by-blow on Twitter.
