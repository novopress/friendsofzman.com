            In the past, they preferred to compare it to fascism, but they wore out the word on Bush. That leaves racism as the scare word of choice. We’re well into the absurd stage of that word’s use so I suspect they will be calling scientific homophobia soon.

            This comment was hilarious:
I just finished: Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010
It was a good read how he explains the growth in poverty among whites while glossing over the same issues that affect minorities.
You would think the title may have provided a clue.

        You should add Cavali-Sforza et al great book “The History and Geography of Human Genes” to those books without impact. In the first chapter, he and his co-authors are required to include the Galilean statement that there are no races. The next several hundred pages amply document the reality of race, there being at least 30 or so easily identified ones from genetics.

            Good point. Maybe if I have time I’ll compile a codex and books that would be banned, if not for the groveling.
