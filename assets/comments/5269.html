        The problem is that the think tanks who pimp free market ideology for small business, e.g. by vigorously coming to the defense of some sandwich shop shut down by eminent domain, are the same ones pimping for big business. (The “crony capitalism” meme of late is targeted at the Ex-Im bank and such, and has little to do with taxes.)Trump could end up alienating people who care less about what the rich are doing and more about their freedom to operate some small biz somewhere. Even though most will fail. This hugely sacred freedom to fail idea, also represented in the freedom to get fat on oversize soda, is a fetish on the American right.

        Tax is great in theory but not so easy to apply in reality. One of the things I was told by a guy who works in a high level accountancy firm in the UK was that often when a large High Street business owes, say, 10 million in tax, their accountants go to the tax ‘authorities’ and say “We’ll pay you 3 million. Take it or leave it; if we go out of business because of a huge tax debt you get nothing from the workers we employ and the High Streets up and down the country will have a lot of empty stores.”The tax ‘authorities’ will take the deal and write the debt off.

        Well you can only arbitrage for so long and then the eloquent little derivative you discovered or the tiny little bit of the market you had cornered gets figured out by someone else and you lose your outrageous profits.I believe that the last parts of Glass-Steagall and the various and sundry interstate banking acts that mattered were repealed towards the end of our favorite grifters’ second term in office (though a lot of the damage was done under Reagan and Bush the Elder).  No surprise there.  What was the narrative being pushed then?  “You can’t finance the greatest economy in the world with a 1930’s banking system.  Europe and Japan don’t separate their mortgage asset pool from their investment asset pool.  We need to change to stay competitive!”  I’ve got to laugh at the bit about Europe and Japan.If the states and municipalities were forced to use GAAP, most cities and counties would be in Chapter 9 and the states would be in default (since their debt is sovereign).
