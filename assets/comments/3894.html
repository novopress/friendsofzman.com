        […] I did a post the other day on the ceremonial status of the American Congress. This is a blog and I’m a crank so I tend to exaggerate for effect. I hope that makes for an entertaining read. The trouble is, I can’t see to exaggerate enough. Every time i look at the Interwbs, I see reality has shot past my exaggerated version of it. Here’s a good example. […]

        The congress critters actually thrive in the abdication of their Constitutional duties.  By outsourcing most of their laws and rulemaking to the Executive branch they effectively insulate themselves from the output of said office.  It helps to campaign on the premise that you did not vote for “that”, when in effect the rarely vote for anything of substance.  Exceptions noted.

        JohnTyler, zman would probably argue that taxes are a necessity to fund infrastructure and defense, that taxes have existed since ancient history, and to abolish taxes would result in societal collapse and  anarchy. If given the option to not pay any taxes, everyone would rationally choose not to pay any

        The republic’s mortal wound was suffered in 1865. The death throes continued for quite a long time – in Rome they lasted for almost a hundred years, from Marius to Actium.

        CHARLES MACKAY Life and Liberty in America–1858A corrupt monarchy or despotism may last for a long time without fatal results to the body politic. In despotic countries the people may be virtuous though the government is vicious; but a corrupt republic is tainted in its blood, and bears the seeds of death in every pulsation. And on this point Mr. Buchanan seems to have a clearer vision than many of his countrymen. He knows, as every President must know, no matter who or what he is, or what his antecedents may have been, what a vast amount of venality has to be conciliated and paid, one way or another, before the hungry maw of Universal Suffrage can be fed and satisfied, and the wheels of the great car of the republic be sufficiently greased.

        Actually the 16th Amendment to the Constitution – the income tax – was the beginning of the end of our Constitutional Republic.Once it became clear that the government could confiscate the earnings (property) of the people, and spend it in a manner to benefit their own re-election prospects and their own power – by spending other people’s money to garner support of their voters – the beginning of the end, literally, began.Also, the Civil War showed that under NO circumstances, could a state leave the union, which weakened any chance of the states threatening to secede.Secession is really the last straw to be utilized in leaving a tyrannical Federal govt., and unless MANY states, all at once chose to secede (say, 25 to 30 states), we are stuck with a Federal govt. ruled by bureaucratic elitists.A possible way to “save” what is left of our long gone Republic, is for a state sponsored Constitutional Convention which amends the Constitution is such a way as to render the Federal Government SUBSERVIENT  to the states; as was originally intended by the Founding Fathers.If this happens, AND if they PROHIBIT the Federal Government from exacting taxes from the people, then there may still be some hope to save this nation.So, from where would the Federal Government get it’s revenue???   Simple, the Federal Govt. would submit to every State Legislature every two (3? 4 ?) years their proposed budget and each state would VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE how much of their state’s citizens’ earnings they would send of to Washington.In this manner, in a very, very short time, the Federal govt. would be  – FINALLY !! – reduced in size and be forced to live within its means.

        The Congress, with maybe a few exceptions, is a convention of liars, crooks and traitors.When a person chooses that path, looking over your shoulder becomes a constant and unrelenting master of your fate. You no longer look forward to the light, you forsake your future and must accept the darkness and bondage of fear.Fear twists all power to resist into an unholy vendetta against that which you fear the most. The fearless and righteous become your enemy. Your sickness becomes a tattered shield and blunt sword. You lie and steal even more in the vain attempt to hold on to the nothing that you’ve become and refuse to recognize.You’re right Z-man, the ceremony is a funeral procession.
