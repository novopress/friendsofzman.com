        What Rufo is arguing for is a mulatto society, which he thinks will be the end of “racism.” I would argue that it would be more stratified than ever, for a mulatto society is highly discriminatory. Take a look at Brazil where the depth of one’s color really matters. Search for the paper bag test” wherein blacks show just how accepting they are …

        It is not possible for whites to play “the skins game.” The skins game is a grift that only exists within the context of a larger culture (somewhat equivocally designated “white”) that still generally believes in erring on the side of generosity and tolerance when dealing with those who, for whatever reason, are considered cultural outsiders. If whites tried to act the way that minorities act within historically white societies, there would be no one for them to petition. There is no culture “above whiteness” for whites to make their appeal to, and no one to supply the gibs that whites would demand. Should that ever happen, the parasites would have killed the host.Similarly, it is not true that minorities always stick together. Black people, for example, are not unreservedly partial to other blacks. Minorities only stick together within the context of that grift that takes place within the larger society (i.e. the skins game) which is itself a somewhat artificial and contrived political grouping. Outside of that context, blacks have no such internal loyalty. The victims of black violence are overwhelmingly other black people, not white people.If you want to end the grift, the correct strategy is to alter the incentive structure so that minorities can no longer profit off the public weal by forming these ersatz interest groups and playing identity politics. It means stopping the gibs. Note that this is not at all the same as saying that “discrimination should be based on merit” like Elon Musk. Mine is a negative, not a positive, proposal. Just stop the gibs, and the identity politics charade falls apart on its own.The rules that govern the public space should not entitle any class of citizens to extract rents at the expense of other classes. This is most likely what normal people mean when they say things like “all men are created equal,” but lack the vocabulary to express clearly. To that extent they are correct, so we should assume good intentions and not ridicule them for that belief.

            Oh gosh, how naive and wrong.  The gibs as you put it do not derive from the people in a primary sense, but from politicians who cater to their greed.  The gibs are developed through the current political process to buy votes.and political contributions. I would also say that the biggest beneficiary of “gibs” are not the people per se but large corporations and oligarchs.  The “gibs” that finally reach the masses are so much table scraps.So really what needs to be spoken about is a change to the current political situation.  But at that point we come full circle to the question of “Can a corrupt political process repair itself?”  And the answer is always the same, “No, the political process must be overthrown and replaced.”As to the non-White races not being ethnocentric—except for the gibs, no studies show this and plenty of examples abound to demonstrate differently.  Blacks are a poor example for any human behavior, but rarely if ever do you hear one, no matter how rich and successful not decry how racist America is and then relate their sob story about perceived discrimination in their lives.  See any Oprah interview.

            The system is here and has been for sixty years. Despite decades of conservatives whining along the same lines that you are (it’s not fair, it’s unjust, it retards bad behavior and incompetence), it’s only gotten stronger. Do you need another six decades to realize that strategy does not work? Yea, sure, “the rules that govern the public space should not entitle any class or citizens to extract rents at the expense of other classes” – sounds great. I agree. Problem is, the rules DO entitle that, what now? Conservatives have no answer, which is how Whites became 2nd class citizens in their own countries. The only way to reverse that is for Whites to start extracting rents at the expense of other classes too – period.

Exactly.  We allow others (non-White minorities) to use our virtues against us.  These minorities have set the “rules of engagement”, not us—so follow them unashamedly.  Their game, their rules.!  Leave your virtues at the area door, enter, win, then retrieve your virtues when you leave.  As 3g4me has said, those virtues are for you and yours—not them.

            Or, you know, we could stand up for ourselves and stop being everyone’s bitch.
Discrimination is fine. I discriminate every day to the benefit of my children. Whites (or the various white tribes) should do the same with our extended families.
I don’t give two shits what other races do. If they want to be morons like whites and not favor their own people, well, that’s fine. Whites should create our own communities and guard them well.

            Uh, blacks had the system that removed the incentives. It was called America before the Civil Rights Act and The Great Society.
Their entire project since then is built around destroying those incentives and creating a patronage and handout network. They will do anything to perpetuate and deepen it. This includes using absolute criminal scum like Martin, Brown and Floyd as martyrs if that is what it takes.

You lost me here.  You’d be far fetched to write something more ridiculous than this.  Apparently you missed the election of Barack Obama, the acquittal of OJ, and the overdose of St. Floyd, just to name a few.

        “Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”
Never agreed with this.
I understood it as poetry, but not as a practicality.  If the monsters are not battled BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, they shall win.

        The false choice was a luxury item of the “end of history” when China had not yet risen and Russia was a shambles, and the Third World had no counter for the US Navy. None of those are true now.The US Navy cannot crush the Houthis who in turn can shut down the Suez Canal quite effectively. The huge inflationary spiral of tankers having to transit around Africa is just now being felt. Cheap, massively available drones and such are something the US Navy has no answer for, at least near-shore.The US cannot crush Russia in Ukraine. All that has happened is to put Russia on a full war footing, generate more patriotism inside Russia, and eliminate bad Russian generals and internal opposition, teach Russian forces how to fight effectively in the era of ultra cheap and mass scale drones.The US is looking at soon, China invading, conquering Taiwan and pushing the US Navy by sinking several carrier groups back east to Hawaii at least and possibly to the West Coast only. Not only does the US Navy have no counter to near-shore drone swarms as show in Yemen, it can only produce drag queens not fighting sailors and admirals.US and Western air travel is now collapsing, predictably, as DEI policies shut down even Blinken’s 737 jetliner.The internal war against White people, to shore up the coalition of the Ascendant (Alphabet+, (((people))), muslims, diverse etc) by a mutual enemy to hate and take stuff from: taxes, jobs, etc. runs straight up against the war against Russia and China (we are currently in the “soft” N-generation phase). The Rulers and Elites will have to choose: continue the War on White people or choose the War on rival great powers. They cannot do both and if they choose the internal enemy they will be supplanted by what amounts to the retarded version of Philip K. Dick’s “Man in the High Castle” with Russia and China running North America.

            It’s very easy for the US Military to steam roll the Houthis, they just choose not to take the necessary measures that would end this. You simply need to ruthlessly smash them and the civilian infrastructure, but they are unwilling to rid the world of these creatures for moral reasons.

                Idiot.
You can bomb sand and rocks forever. That is the pretty much the Houthi “infrastructure”.
The only way to subdue these people is boots on the ground. And they have plenty of experience at the kind of fighting as well.
But perhaps if the USSA can draft an armchair general such as yourself, you can show they way.
Hope you are good at leading trannies and Central Americans and making do with less. (You no doubt have been too busy formulating strategy to realize there is a recruitment and material crisis in your military.)

                    Again, too many people in these circles fall into the trap of assuming the Western regime is entirely incompetent because certain things don’t work so well (like inflation or crime).
They could absolutely kill or displace 95+% of that part of Yemen by intentionally bombing of civilians and infrastructure until Yemeni culture and Islam ceases to exist there without putting boots on the ground. Furthermore, warfare is increasingly becoming automated with fewer people needed to pull physical triggers. They’re simply unwilling to exterminate these people.

        Brilliant!What is important to Conservatives is to preserve a notion, or an ideal not a people. They really want to preserve meritocracy. That is a worthy goal. They do not understand that the only people who play that game the way they want it played are historically and are now, people of European ancestry – white people.The other thing they want to preserve is a system where the government does not use coercion. You could see a system where the force of the government was changed to being used to enforce what amounts to white dispossession via the Civil Rights Regime, to being used to enFORCE a meritocracy. Then you return to the who question. Whoever is in charge of the enFORCEment will define meritocracy.They will not abandon meritocracy, they will not abandon the multi-racial society experiment, they will not abandon a government that does not use force. In doing so, they have abandoned the battle field and there is no war. It was a rout.Merit works for Musk because he is not handing out goodies. He is paying people. Everything else is in this society is some form of zero sum goody that someone hands out. So, who will force that it remains on merit? In other words, Amy Wax has spelled it out very clearly. In a meritocracy, you will have very few blacks and a few more hispanics in any positions that require high cognitive abilities and a strong work ethic (propensity to forego instant gratification). Thus, in this society, which we had before the ’50s, when blacks get pissed off you have to be willing and able to put them down.Hispanics do have a higher distribution of people who work hard and they are entering trades and have a larger cohort who would be perfectly happy with finding their place. They would probably also wholly support an iron hand in dealing with their criminal element – which the blacks not only don’t do, they actively promote lawlessness for their criminal element.Alternatively, what White Nationalism offers, is peaceful separation so you then could reconstitute the society that Rufo and Musk want. It is on these terms that Musk can and must be persuaded to operate. You will either have to put down people who are unhappy with the results of meritocracy, and use whatever force is necessary, or live with riots. Alternatively, we can peacefully separate. Blacks can build Wakanda and whites who want to help them can voluntarily give them their time and money to do so.The European people and their project can then resume its destiny and stop the panels from flying off and nosedives straight into the ocean from happening.I do believe Musk is open to an honest conversation and proposal. We should consider making it to him. Perhaps if we look at this the right way it isn’t White Nationalism, but National Nationalism/Destiny. Blacks clearly want to control their own destiny. Give them some territory to do it in. Does that one step eliminate DIE altogether? It will reduce it. If there is more to be done, look at which other group is agitating and repeat peaceful separation.It is time to put this in front of the right eyes in the right way. In the meantime, conservatism is bleeding out on a battlefield having dreaming its life’s final dream – that it is still in the fight.

                        My experience in academia was that the Pajeets and Chinks only cared about getting the credential or grade and had zero interest in actually learning the material.If there was a way to cheat or get an A without actually working or learning anything they were all over it.  One even directly asked me to give him my answers to the final for a course I’d taken the previous semester that he was presently taking, as if I would be stupid enough to let him turn in a verbatim copy of my work that the professor would easily detect.Part of the European culture they don’t care about is honesty, and the way we compete with these parasites is to kick them out of our societies and put them back in the feces-smeared shithole countries they slithered out of.

Don’t agree with this.  You preserve and promote and BETTER your own because they are your own.  You don’t put strangers above them because they’re supposedly more meritorious.

            I beg to differ. Blacks only want to forge their own destiny on the bodies of Whites. If you were to pitch this idea to the “leaders” of the black community and they were told in no uncertain terms that Whites would be out of the picture, the overwhelming majority of blacks would loose their minds.When the idea of reparations first got a serious look and various plans were being bounced around, there was one thing that the black community insisted on and that was there would be NO one-time payment from White America. Reparations are to be an ongoing thing. In fact, one of the proponents specifically said that “Until whites have experienced 400 years of what we suffered, reparations will continue until the black community is satisfied.” and all of us know that that day will never come.

            RealityRules:  In no way do I want a color-blind meritocracy.  Whether the .01% of capable joggers or the 5% of suitable mestizos achieve an education and job and lifestyle which supposedly corresponds with their abilities is Not My Concern.  Spergy theorists like Sailer, who has no loyalty to his own race, love to discuss that imaginary, color-blind ‘meritocracy’ which will just so happen to be majority White and east Asian, with a sprinkling of others to spice things up.  Similar to Derbyshire’s fantasy.‘Who Says’ it’s wrong or immoral to prefer one’s own?  ‘Who Says’ we must give equal opportunity to aliens who come, generally unasked and unwanted, to our shores?  If the people who founded Harvard intended it to train pastors, and their eventual heirs decided it made a good upper-class finishing school, Who Says they absolutely had to allow in juice or han of supposed merit?When the argument concerns individual versus community rights and preferences, we’ve all been trained to respond “You go, girl!” when it comes to following ‘dreams,’ as opposed to what’s best for society as a whole.  Yes, it probably does suck to sacrifice many of one’s hopes in life for family or community.  Personally, I always had a problem with the way that issue was handled in “It’s a Wonderful Life.”  George ended up sacrificing all his dreams and interests on the altars of family and community, and I suppose I ought to applaud that as a Christian.  But part of me always feels that George got a raw deal, and surely there ought to be some reciprocity in others sacrificing their plans and dreams once in a while?So overall perhaps we can find a better balance between individual and community rights.  Sure, acreage “x” is Mr. Jones’ property, but allowing him to sell it to a Chinese millionaire will destroy the peace and privacy of his neighborhood.   It’s difficult enough to find that correct mixture between the personal and the public within a homogeneous society.  But add in the ‘dreamers’ or ‘achievers’ of other races and insist that we must make a place for them?No.   Just NO.  There will always be a bell curve and even Whites will always have their bottom 10%.  But it’s that mixture of people and interests and abilities that used to make life so pleasant and interesting.  Derbyshire likes to claim the occasional non-White adds “spice” to the soup.  “Who says” the White soup we used to have – the country and culture England used to have – is somehow inherently lacking without that added alien touch?Somehow, Chaucer and Shakespeare managed to write of all sorts of different and interesting characters and conditions without  feeling the need to call for their nation to be upended and rent in order to introduce outsiders – on grounds of merit or spice or anything else.Keep merit – and everything else – within the race.  Visit other places.  Share ideas.  Perhaps return with a craving for some new food you tasted abroad.  Then . . Go Buy a Cookbook! If that isn’t sufficient, return to country “x” and ask to be trained in preparation of their cuisine.  But no importing strangers to satisfy personal desires or tastes.  We have all the cooks and singers and garbagemen and engineers we need amongst ourselves.

                “It’s difficult enough to find that correct mixture between the personal and the public within a homogeneous society.”THIS.  People, even within the same group, are naturally at odds and IN CONFLICT.   Hobbes war of all against all. Conflict of man against man, between men and women, between rich and poor, between and within familes. . .the story of life is a fight for love and glory.  It a miracle if a people can create a fragile peace that produces harmony and prosperity.The correct understanding of this is an incredible triumph AGAINST human nature through hard work and discipline.  It is not at all to be taken as something granted and only a fool would.  A fool  (and psycho) would then assume that granted and say, “lets throw tons of aliens tribes into the mix also and it’ll all still be hunky dory!”

        The desire of (most) whites to win (or at least stalemate) the culture war at no cost or risk to themselves is the root thing here, which makes false choices seem appealing to them. And gives rise to “the wish for kings,” aka vote harder, hoping some guy on a horse will ride in to make it all ok. Position currently occupied by the blonde dyed real estate developer. As if he’s up to it. As if anybody could be.Not giving them false choices won’t give them better choices. It will just drive home the “you’re screwed” nature of the situation. Maybe it is better to whisper sweet nothings to the dying, than to terrify them with their impending doom. On the other hand it could do a lot for our collective sanity if people stopped pretending.

            And now Jeffrey Zoar with the win today. We are all too comfortable and conflict averse. We are all going to have to in some way at some place take a stand. Our stand can be perfectly reasonable.When confronted by DIE to implement it at work a reasonable approach seems to be:‘I don’t want to get exposed to discrimination lawsuits after some Socratic questioning that clearly establishes that DIE is discriminatory – against whites and against whites exclusively. e.g. Aren’t you asking me to hire and create hiring and promotional preferences based on skin color? (It can’t be denied). You are asking me to do something illegal and I will not abdicate my fiduciary responsibility to the firm and expose it to lawsuits – leaving aside the morality of willfully instituting racial hiring preferences. I can’t do either of those no matter how well intentioned this program may be. I will hire, fire and promote based on merit.On the other side of being a victim of the pogrom is being willing to sue the hell out of the person who is anti-white and legally harms us. While the Civil Rights regime lives, we wield it as the weapon right back against those who for decades have used it to dispossess us. It sucks to be litigious, but we have to punch back and that is one obvious way.

                I’m sorry to be contrarian today, but we don’t HAVE to be “reasonable.”  There is NO moral imperative that says we MUST consider the other side in this debate.  “Because it/he is ours” is all the rationale we need.  In attempting to be fair or considerate, you are implicitly accepting that the other side’s desires have merit.  No, they don’t – not if this is to ever again be a nation of White people.

                    You can’t make that argument until it is a homogenous ethno state. You can be unreasonable, but you will be outnumbered and cast out.In other words, I could have enemy soldiers in my bunker and take them out by tossing a grenade, but I won’t live to fight another day. What good is that?You have to be strategic. What gets us at least back to freedom of association which is not our own state but way better than this dumpster fire? You use their laws against them since they are violating them. That is the tactic. What does this do if done so that it inflicts a lot of pain. It gets you to the table and perhaps the ability to get freedom of association back by getting those powerful people to fight with you to end the Civil Rights Act.You get rid of that, then you can hire and fire who you want. We have to use Aikido principles and use our enemy’s moves against them. I am all ears for a strategy and tactics that get us what we want or at least gets us to a stronger position. Being unreasonable doesn’t have me convinced.

            Aside from the fact that we’ve been importing the wrong people for years,  it’s also the sheer volume.  They want a billion people here in the literal sense, stacking everyone up in rabbit hutches like East Asia.  Because “muh GDP” has to stay in the big leagues.  Only the billion+ countries will matter.  Then they’ll say “we still have plenty of open spaces.”  I’m sorry, Nevada doesn’t count.  And neither do the Dakotas.  For the size of our country what’s amazing is how so much of the open space is some of the ugliest terrain you’ve ever seen.  We only have places like the Tetons because it is so large, according to the law of averages you have to have something nice somewhere.

                Vinneyvette:  No, it didn’t work out “just fine.”  Yes, White Christian immigrants had more natural cultural and religious affinity, but genuine “assimilation” rarely exists.  What one gets – after multiple generations and intermarriage – is a synthesis.  The Ellis Island immigrants changed settler America as much as it changed them.And we still have pockets of minimally assimilated Italians and others on the east coast.  In researching my late mother in-law ‘s ancestors and others from the same village, I found that the first generation here generally married someone whose parents were from the same village.  The second generation married people from other villages, but still Italians.  Only in the third generation did the majority marry other ethnicities – and still only minimal marriages with protestant heritage Americans.There were exceptions, of course, but the melting pot was always a myth.  I’m not saying the effects of those immigrants was wholly negative, but  neither was their impact wholly positive or even neutral.  “Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.”

        As much as I favor the idea of using persuasion to awaken the slumbering sane to the clear and present dangers of our modern societal disaster, I don’t think that this option will succeed (or at the very least, has a very low probability of success). Yes, we can continue sleepwalking into the future by dosing on the false hopium of voting harder, but that is simply another repetitive misstep on the road to damnation. Nothing will change until the environment changes. Only then will the awakening be forced upon us.Bongino advocates the false binary of vote-harder or bloody civil war as the sole alternatives. That is an immoral framing of the argument. Not only are there other rational options, but perpetual vote-harder is suicide in slow motion and ultimately guarantees death of the patient. And he wants to lead the lemmings toward the cliff at double-time.I advocate for contingency planning in the event that persuasion fails and a collapse is forced upon us. What do we do when food is scarce and the round-ups begin? Do we fight and kill our neighbor because its convenient? Or do we focus on the root of the problem? Methinks the latter is the only moral course of action. Fog, focus, and finality.

        Relevant to today’s post, you won’t see any “conservatives” making a peep about this:
vdare.com/posts/year-in-the-death-of-white-america-451-underreported-black-on-white-homicides-in-2023
I know of no other site (not even Anglin’s) that compiles this astounding DAILY assault on White America.  The monthly report comes out about 2-3 days either side of the 10th of the following month.  This is the first year-end review I’ve seen of the carnage that continues unabated.  451.  Reparations, anyone?

                Thanks, Eloi.  I’ll check it out.  Hate, properly channeled, can be a powerful and, yes, even positive force for change.  If the left and their street thugs are gonna hate whitey, then I’m gonna hate them right back…. in spades.  Pun intended.

            All three were used to create the myth of Obama long before Obama.  He stepped into the role and took the reigns of the brainwashing machine.  And let’s pause and reflect on the fact that this country reelected him.  I’m using that refrain more often.  “We reelected Obama.”  A people who do that deserve to be carted off to Babylon and lose it all.

My white friends and co-workers were GIDDY about Bathhouse Barry.  He was on the INTERNET and the John Stewart show.  He was hip and cool.  He was the black boy that every Karen wanted to $#@!.  He was the decent black guy who you could work with in the office.
Most importantly: “…at last, I can PROVE I’m not racist.”

                I feel that Poitier would only have been appealing to the awfls of the 60s. I would guess that there were fewer of them then than there are now.
I would think your average blue collar Joe in 1967 would have found his movies insulting and/or hamfisted. Of course it was easy back then to live in 90+ percent white areas then so maybe your blue collar Joe was just as naive

                    In 1967, black-white race relations seemed to be improving.  The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 had recently passed.  Widespread black rioting was not yet a perennial feature of American life. It was thought at the time– with the passage of enough time, the expenditure of enough money, and with sufficient goodwill on the part of well-meaning blacks and whites — that blacks would eventually catch up with whites.  Unfortunately, it didn’t quite turn out that way.

                        1967 was the third straight year of widespread negro rioting. Significantly, negro antisocial behavior escalated from its already high level the more whites extended the palm to them.

        “The left proposed redefining marriage to mean sharing rent and a bed. Instead of rejecting this out of hand, the right proposes civil unions, thus leaving us with two degenerate options.”There is a large family in my community who are devout Christians. They have five kids and the husband works really hard to support his wife who diligently teaches their children at home.Their oldest daughter is 17 and has been telling them that she is now a boy. They obviously love her and their world has been torn apart by this. They have had to put her in a type of group home because they are greatly concerned about the influence she could have on their younger kids. It’s a heartbreaking situation.Damn the conservatives for never standing up and for always permitting the degenerate tentacles of the left to destroy so much.

            Likely she got that from Social Media or School. The only other reason is usually sexual abuse.One of my uncles has a son who went to the “Catholic” University and came back a tranny. They’re trying to figure out what to do before he permanently mutilates himself. My guess in this case is autogynephilia.Sad to say it, but a lot of the reason is Christian parents are just plain weak, and the kids can sense the outside culture is far more powerful. They simply don’t have the vitality for a real war. One of the dumbest tropes is that kids naturally rebel. It’s nonsense. Kids follow power, and teen rebellion is a result of a stronger power pulling kids away from their parents.

                    Is social media the cause, or a covariant?  I wonder.  Getting back to the concept of “spiteful mutants” from Dutton and Woodley, are these people simply products of their (failed) genetics who have been allowed to live and “thrive” and worse, reproduce, in our modern society?Think about the state of our society 100 or 200 years ago.  Could a person—even if they “feel” they are more feminine than masculine—have “come out” and been applauded and supported in that society? Could they have been allowed to wear women’s clothing and have been protected from discrimination in employment, housing and such?I’m leaning toward an environment that does not so much cause the behavioral pathology, but as to allow it to manifest and thrive.  Thereby encouraging others into such behavior.A distinction perhaps without a difference.

                        It is definitely cultural rather than genetic–and that culture is exceedingly cruel, as Glen and Melissa noted. While we observe homosexuality in other species (although not at the recently high rate as is claimed among humans), we do not observe transgenderism in nature. Why is that unique to us? Culture. If transgenderism and other sexual deviancy are stigmatized, they largely disappear over time unless there is some biological basis for it, which generally is not the case.See “racism” for a good example of how cultural stigma can stifle something regardless of the informational means of dissemination of the concept. Unlike the previously mentioned deviancies, there actually is a biological and evolutionary basis for racism and yet the concept is largely squelched (yes, since the concept has roots in reality, over time censorship has to be  imposed to contain it, the opposite of transgenderism, but the point stands).

                        Jack, still don’t see your reply as denying genetic influence.  I have no desire to date men, nor play the role of a woman.  Why?  I am imbued with the same societal pressures as you describe—yet I am immune.  Why?  Well, I was born that way.
Genetics predisposes, society shapes that predisposition, hence homosexuality and transism.  A society that represses such predisposition is, as we are finding out, perhaps the better one all things considered.

                        @Compsci:
Transgenderism is definitely cultural and has been prevalent is earlier societies, too. There apparently is some genetic basis for homosexuality and perhaps some other deviancies, but outside of humans, transgenderism does not exist in nature and there does not appear to be any genetic basis/predisposition for it.
Granted, all of it can be suppressed and a better society would result, but at least transgenderism seems to be–forgive the term!–purely a social construct. If it were not promoted it would not exist. Some of the other deviancies would occur regardless of promotion or suppression.

                It isn’t weakness Chet. Do not be hard on such people.My daughter ran away to join the circus ten years ago as a gay militant lesbian. For me a line had been crossed, and when I refused to get dragged across it with her… our family imploded. Everyone took sides. You go to war with everyone, your own family, your in-laws… and no one is your friend. The women were the worst. Eventually I got cancelled. There IS a God, and by His grace my marriage held. But…we were banished from the hive ten years ago.As our elders become frail geriatrics… I have been generously pardoned for my sins and allowed to help provide geriatric care for them. I do my part, but I have no real connection with them anymore. I haven’t seen my daughter in over ten years and probably never will. I can accept and live with it.Parents confronted by sin and perversion in their kids have  two choices: say goodbye to your heart, OR… say good bye to your mind. It is a truism that liberalism is a mental disorder. Coexisting with those lunatics means throwing away your sanity. Going to war with them shreds your heart. Wounds like that don’t walk off, either way you are in for a world of hurt that will take years to heal. Some people just vapor lock and freeze in the headlights… and at some point, eventually lose their minds anyway.To this day I still wonder sometimes if I made the right choice. But then I read the stuff by our esteemed blog host and the bums in the comments… and my doubts evaporate. At some point our kids have to answer for who they are on their own, and their world is meaner, nastier and crazier than even mine was. The only answers I see at this point are ones that involve steel, lead and shot…but whadda I know? All I know for sure is that I can’t live in someone else’s lunacy, and that the real world is what it is.

                    Filthie:Beautiful post. I’m glad your marriage was strong enough to withstand. These situations are devastating and overwhelming to bear.
Many of the good, Christian families I know are unaware of just how evil the plan is to destroy not only White America but White families.It’s almost as though they are such good people that they simply can’t imagine how bad tptb are.

                        Ain’t that the truth. And as tough as it is on fathers, it is sheer hell for the moms. Against my objections the church elders at our little chapel out in the country are starting to refer devastated, estranged and cancelled parents to me when their kids go sideways. I am not good enough to be any kind of spiritual advisor, nor am I an expert on coping with queers and lunatics… but I tell them: the Bible is what it is, it says what it means and it means what it says. I just mostly listen and commiserate with them as they grieve. I also tell them that they can only do what they can do. As they said above, most of this horror is driven by social media and the schools. It’s creeping into the churches too. After a certain point All we can do for these kids is pray and be there for them if they decide to turn themselves around and fly right. If you “tolerate” their demons… don’t be surprised if they become your demons too. I’ve seen that happen all to often.I wish I had something meaningful to say or real help to offer.

                        Melissa:  If I may offer an alternate explanation?  Too many Christians, as devout as they may seem, do not truly believe in the existence of ‘evil.’  They’ve been so saturated in the “God is Love” and “Love the sinner, hate the sin” pabulum, that they no longer comprehend the existence of evil itself or its human adherents.
In retrospect, I think there was something to be said for the old “fire and brimstone” Christianity.  Modern churchians threw the baby out with the bathwater.

                    That was well said and I commend you on your openness. We have three (adults now) children and part of having a family is the stark realization that they are individuals. I think we all agree that as an individual, a person will go their own way at some point. That’s the way it is.
I have been very fortunate with my family outcomes so far.

                    The only answers I see at this point are ones that involve steel, lead and shot—A Fedi poster had some poll of doctors asking why they didn’t go into the abortion business and large percent avoided the field because of “fear of political violence”.  I hold out hope for a more well reasoned solution though, of course.

                    “To this day I still wonder sometimes if I made the right choice.”If you followed your conscience, you made the right choice. Dr Martin Luther (the real one) said, ” … to go against conscience is neither right nor safe.”I had to bury my first-born, a son, in Oct 2001. That’s what has happened to you with your daughter. It’s not something that one “gets over” but one DOES get through it; one gets past it. After such a loss, however, nothing can ever touch you again. The worst has befallen you, and you are still sane and alive and you obeyed your conscience. And that is not nothing. You have won a hard victory, whether you can see that or not.There IS a God, yes. And if you cling to that, you WILL be all right. Trust me on that.God bless you and keep you in His unfailing grace. I know what you are going through and what you have been through. I do.

        It’s amazing how so-called “muh free speech” Anglosphere has such blanket, “consensual” censorship. If you follow Eric Zemmour and Marion Marechal in France, they get invited on national TV all the time to complain about anti-White racism and Black/Arab crime. You’d never see that in the US, UK or Australia/NZ.

            This is the stench of Puritanism. France does not suffer it. To be fair, if Zemmour or Marechel make the same statements to the public in a forum away from the media, they theoretically could be charged with crimes (it has happened to others), but isn’t that now the case throughout the Anglosphere, which also would destroy any broadcast outlet that followed the French model?One of the biggest lies we suffer is the belief we are free. That’s never been true and becomes less so with each passing day. The public stocks never went away in the Anglosphere. They simply are  managed now by ignorant Hottentots in sun dresses controlled by Jews.

OT, but that reminds me. It’s been said the American Civil War was a continuation of the English Civil War. Fair enough. Could it also be said the English Civil War was a continuation of Wessex, et al, vs the Danelaw?
Granted, I’m a Pennsylvanian with a Norman family name, so I have an interest. Still, I’m stuck with a notion of, essentially, spergy Vikings doing spergy Viking mayhem trying to cope with culture/ideas/ethics that don’t fit them well.

                        Just a cursory look at the history of the British Isles, and what I know of American history, leave me the impression of something extraordinary. Maybe I’m biased by the present, but it seems to revolve around identity. All of these Northern European tribes crashing together, splitting apart, coming back together, very slowly becoming a people, or not. By turns dominant and subjugated.  Confidently spreading around the world, then doubting the project. Etc. It’s as if our politics, culture, religion revolve around this problem and this tempestuous way of being we have. I wish I understood it fully, but I don’t think we’re anywhere near the end of the story.

No. It is a criminal offence. But France still has a free press and much freer speech than anyplace else that I know of, the Holocaust Legends being a notable exception, quite unworthy of a great nation, which France still is, believe it or not.

        False choices cherished by the right also includes the idea that buying guns will keep you free (not having a gun means you are at risk from the government).
All these guns have not resulted in any rights being preserved including the 2nd amendment which keeps being chipped away at and will eventually fall when the left manages to pack the court.
All of the false choices the right is given result in the right not pushing back sufficiently against the jihads waged by the left and their Globocap masters.

            The gun people drive me insane.  They use them as pacifiers or protection from their neighbors.  Having a gun for self-defense is fine and recommended.  But claiming you have a gun to defend rights you absolutely will not defend under any circumstances is just foolish and silly.  The only right they even say they will defend to the death is the right to keep the gun.  In that case, the government can do anything just so long as they get to keep their guns locked up and unloaded and a danger to nobody.

                Tar’s, absolutely correct and to the point!However let me add a slightly more benign view.  People are basically cowards.  They need a strong leader to rally around.  To light the spark so to speak.  When that leadership arises, then a populace with basic equipment and understanding of such use of firearms is infinitely better than a populace that has only a distant memory of such things.For myself, I remember purchasing my first pistol, a Colt 1911.  I was in some awe of it and would never consider carrying it as a personal defense weapon—albeit completely legal and accepted in my State at the time.  This soon passed with training and use.  Now such a weapon is as common in my daily life as wallet and house keys.So whom do you want beside you?  The pre-firearm owning rube of 40 years ago, or the old guy now with more guns than teeth.

                    I would put it a little more benignly than that. Most people (and I’d include myself in that) have an idea of what a better society would be, but have no idea of how to get there. Assuming we are not yet beyond Claire’s awkward stage, what can one actually do?I’ve got bug-in and bug-out both pretty well in hand. Friends good and true in both locations. But apart from head on a swivel, I’m not sure what my next step could be. It’s not that I need a leader to follow. Just a couple of practical ideas would be more than enough.One thing I’m almost positive of, though, is that those who are still unarmed are basically useless to me at best, but more likely a liability.

                All true, but I suspect there is actual government opposition to firearms ownership because it makes it somewhat harder to hire thugs to enforce its edicts. Otherwise, yes, they are useless crutches outside of personal safety use.

            Nope. White people sense the Pol Pot moment is coming. It cannot be held back. Hence, the gun buying.
All that anti-White sentiment ultimately ends up at Pol Pot. They know. At that time, the only solution is what Machiavelli advised. Always be armed. This is why the elites are so determined to eliminate gun ownership. To make the Pol Pot moment so much easier. People know.

            Empirically speaking, an armed population does not prevent tyranny. But it is certainly good for self defense.
The missing link making private firearms inert against tyranny is organization. IRA, Vietcong, Taliban are all top down organizations. Americans with millions of firearms, or Europeans with a lot of hunting weapons (fewer handguns), are individuals watching their children being abused to hate themselves and their heritage. Organization and the willingness to sacrifice for one’s people. That’s the difference between the former and the latter

        Musk seems to be more libertarian in his world view, he still needs some slaps across his face to wake up to reality.

                Musk becomes a perfectly coherent character with no secrets if you discard the assumption that he’s smart—which you should, because it’s a libertarian assumption of market justice, the white equivalent of “If you’re so smart, why aren’t you rich?”He’s nerdy because he’s *not* intelligent. He objects to injustice because he *doesn’t* understand it. He stumbles into—and immediately gets shock-collared away from—/ourguys/ because he doesn’t have the “social intelligence” (observational and concept-forming ability) to recognize us. Will he learn anything from his persecution? There’s no teenage libertarian or illiterate “rationalist” explanation for it, so no.He’s a Trump-style accidental traitor to the system whose *minuscule* defection is a grave injury to the regime’s narcissism, and bait/accelerant for its id. He has no capacity to realize this.

                    Two of the great questions of our time: Who created Peter Thiel, and who created Elon Musk?
Because they sure as hell didn’t create themselves.
Someone chose them to be playing the roles which they are playing in this drama.
Someone – Some Group – very powerful, very well connected, very reticent about divulging their own true identities.
Who are they?
What are their intentions?
What are their goals?

            We already have a “life lesson” in the effect of DIE on air travel!  To say DIE will/can not affect safety is a “tell” that the writer allows his ideology to overcome observable reality.  Or stated a bit more nicely, simply is not acquainted with the facts.I’ve written about this in this forum at least a couple of times previously, so for the sake of new followers I’ll briefly restate.  It has to do with the 2 fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 max a few years back.In short, the two planes were flown by 3rd world airlines and native pilots.  This was possible due to lowered training standards allowed by Boeing’s computer assisted cockpit controls.  Quite literally, the pilot takes off from the runway by pressing a computer screen “take off” icon, the automated systems programmed by Boeing do the rest.  Landing is done similarly.Of course, there was that one in a 100 or so instance where weather conditions fool the computer and the plane stalls and bad things happen.  I saw an interview with an experienced (on Boeing 737 max) American (White guy) pilot commenting on the crashes.  He had experienced the *same* failure—more than once—and survived.  He survived by *immediate* override of auto-pilot and executing a rather counterintuitive control maneuver to prevent/remediate stall condition.His point was basically, you need immediate action, much experience in the cockpit, and great confidence in your ability to override your natural instinct to panic.  In at least one instance of the two crashes cited, the pilots were completely puzzled as to what was happening and were busy looking (I kid you not) at the plane’s emergency action manual when they hit the ground!You can be sure that DIE pilot candidates will also be placed into the cockpit after being certified as to their ability at pressing icons for *automated* take off and landing with similar results.There is a reason we have two pilots in every commercial flight, and it’s not to press icons on a computer screen.

                Interesting perspective on the 737 debacle. I still think the max is a badly designed plane but your made me think of the old principle that the man is more important that the equipment 9 times out of 10.

                    I can’t argue wrt the design of the 737 max—and I guess using the word “design” is a bit of a misnomer if what I’ve heard is correct, that the 737 max is a bastard expansion of a perfectly fine 737 original design.
Another way to look at my comment is to take the plane out of the posting and think of our efforts to design a “driverless automobile”.  How’s that working out so far?

        It’s not about race, religion, gender, or any other divider issue.  It’s about powerful people conquering by dividing.  It’s about setting up oppressor vs. oppressed to take full control.

Okay, so who is that?
“powerful people conquering by dividing”
So, everyone on earth would just live happily if powerful people weren’t exacerbating divisions for their own unspecified reasons?  Kum Bah yah.
It seems like you must oppose all immigration laws, since those are divisions.  Right?
Finally, if powerful people are exploiting divisions for some reason, then that reason is the more fundamental explanation for their behavior, rather than the mere act of dividing people.
Race is the deepest cause of division, but that division is authentic and best respected.

                    Apart from a few outliers, I doubt it’s possible to name names because it’s become melded into the culture in general. For example, you could probably come up with a couple people outstanding in their villainy who had something to do with the tranny explosion, but I think looked at honestly, it’s more of a confluence of minor actors that social media somehow synergizes.
That said, I did chuckle a bit at @LitS’ assumption that @WillC’s vision of the future is a Kum Bah Ya utopia in an essay aptly named, “False Choices.”

                        @LitS, “What are some of the choices that I am overlooking between organizing our society around the importance race and not?”Guess I didn’t express that very well.What I meant was that by about 3rd grade, pretty much everyone has had it pounded into him that no social arrangement is going to be ideal. So dismissing @WillC’s argument by assuming his chosen social arrangement (whatever that is) would lead to some perfect world might be valid if he were 8 years old, but not if you extend to him the basic assumption that whatever he’s trying to describe makes sense to him.Once he says there will be no more sickness, no more death, go for the kill.

            WillC:  I call straight up bull-shite.  The divisions amongst people are both natural – i.e. at a genetic, cellular level – and God  ordained.  We are not fungible nor equal.  Nothing in nature is.  This simplistic chant of “Don’t let them divide us” deliberately omits who is “them” and who  composes the “us.”  Your “us” is not my “us.”
Yes, it damned well is about race, religion, and sex (gender pertains to language, not people).  All those things which compose human identity, and make us individual creations.
Go push your globalist pabulum on stupid people.

                Wow, never thought  my comment  would be interpreted to be about being a globalist and ignore the problems and just limit the elite and we would all be happy. I am definitely a capitalist, communist hating, Constitution-loving American. We are definitely not all equal in our abilities.  I’m meaning that globalists are using our inequality to create an oppressor versus an oppressed worldview in America because economic divisions have not worked in the New World.  Basically using critical theory encouraged by the Franklin School to imprison us all. We need to stop those people from using human greed to make people think we can solve the problems with government power.  That’s why I said that you’re correct about all these divisions and false choices.  They are definitely grifters taking advantage of being “a protected class”, and that needs to end. I just believe there are evil people that are happy to not let any crisis go to waste. I wish we could all use rules for radicals against them. Isolate them, freeze them, and make it personal. It’s really hard to do that though, when the media is all going along with them.

        “We are seeing this again with the war over the antiwhite pogroms labeled Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. It is not an accident that the acronym DEI could easily be DIE, as the people behind this do not hide their intensions. When they say they want to eliminate whiteness, there is only one way this can happen. If one were to call for eliminating Jewishness, you get compared to Hitler. Therefore, logic dictates that when they say they want to eliminate whiteness, they mean white people.”This is a Jewish supremacist project pure and simple. Kevin MacDonald would have a fair amount to say on the topic. The thing about DIE is that these people are tribal themselves and give preference to one another in myriad ways.The history of the human world is tribal in nature. Tribes are a survival mechanism. Without the tribe and tribal members looking out for one another and preferring one another, the individual dies. Individual identity itself is drawn from tribal identity and becomes a meaningless joke without it.Without tribal identity white people are doomed to extinction.In passing, the 14th century Arab historian Ibn Khaldun had much of contemporary relevance to say about “asabiyyah” (roughly “tribal spirit”) as a force that could prevail against senescent and decadent civilisations. This is the only weapon whites have.

            While I agree with your post, you also need to realize that the people getting all of the spoils of this bullshit have not put up any resistance to it or spoken up about it.  The criminal race has gladly taken their preferences and “free shit” from YT with a big smile on their faces.  In the eyes of the criminal race, they are always a victim of the white man.  So while we can say that the juice have a lot to do with this, the subjects have been more than complicit.

                Just like Bill Gates recognized that software (and specifically, operating systems) was the driving force behind computing and essentially cornered that market, the juice understand/understood that fiat currency – and control over it – is the single most powerful node in the system.  Control that, and practically everything else falls into place.  So while the subjects have been complicit to some extent, there was really little choice once 1913 came around.  Can it be undone? Probably, but not without a lot of pain.

        I just don’t know if Whites as a group have it in them to stand up and seriously push back against this s***.  As Z has said, 20% of that cohort is insane.  Life is still too easy and comfortable to rock the boat in a big way.  Recently, I joined a new golf group – nice guys and all, but they’re nearly to a man totally into the local college negro sportsball teams, to say nothing of the negro felon league.  As I gave up all that stuff years ago, I don’t get it – I mean a large number of us grew up watching that stuff, but 40-50 years ago the nfl and probably the nba were 60-70% White – now it’s just the opposite.  I don’t understand how people can watch that crap anymore, especially when every commercial features all blacks or other POCs and maybe a White or two.  It’s mind boggling.  As long as Whitey is willing to slavishly to lap that garbage up, nothing much is going to change.

            No less an authority than Rupert Murdoch, when asked why he was paying such high prices for TV sports broadcast rights, said “Because sports are tribal”.
Sports are the way lots of white guys connect to others. They are reluctant to lose this connection. Something will have to come along to replace this connection. It may be “the need for survival”……

                For white sportsball fans, sports are tribal only in the local sense–city or university. Whites do not watch sports to bolster racial solidarity. On the contrary, the vast majority of them are pathetic Hutuphiles who disdain their own race.
Now for PoC, and especially nuggras, sportsball is racially tribal as all get out. The only reason negroes watch football and basketball is because their own kind are numerically dominant.

                    Good point. A nice first step in investing in one’s whitness is jettisoning all Hutu affectations. For many people this is difficult to do because the entire pop “culture” is little more than a concatenation of Afro-savage signs and gestures.

            To gain an understanding how defeated whites have become, look no further than the father of Ethan Liming or the daughter of the retired police chief who was run down by scholars on his bicycle.  They couldn’t wait to let everyone know that it isn’t about race, and not to judge all by the actions of “the few”.  There are no words to describe my anger over such things.In my mind, the negro was created with the left over slop that was going to be thrown away after God created the rest of humanity.  Someone screwed up and allowed the sludge to be re-injected into the machine.  Everything they touch they destroy.

            Caucasian people can watch those circuses because most weren’t raised well, same as the people who watched those companies of entertaining performers 50 years ago. Childlike fools love the circus.Look also at some pictures of kids performing the Bellamy salute, which was abolished in the early 1940’s to avoid awkward comparisons. That’s evidence that those generations, too, weren’t raised well, and that was back in the day when most Caucasian parents bamboozled their children into believing that a Semitic supremacist is their god. It’s obvious that pre-Bellamy generations weren’t raised right. If they were they wouldn’t have allowed teachers to regiment their children into drones of a toxic empire.Now, the Z Man always has little to say on this blog about the raising of children, about the phases or stages of an individual life, and about the modes of living (e.g. student, householder, retiree, and renunciant). What conclusion(s) ought we to infer from this and other facts when the host starts shaking the cup again?

            The same males who would never say anything explicitly pro-White, or even use the word “white” in reference to their own people, will time and again say “we won last night” wrt their favored franchise. “We”. Right.I watched a game with some of these males not long back as part of a social event for our church. The product is total garbage. It exists on fumes of desperation and nostalgia.What struck me, aside from the obvious blackitty-black of it all was that it seemed the camera operators and little men in the production trailer are going out of their way to show the absolute most fat, soy-laden, cucky of super-fans in the stands between plays. Like they have a contest among them of who can get the most pathetic looking fan on camera.But then again, I live in flyover. These people send their daughters to rape U precisely because of the “big school sports scene”. Not having much in common with my White Brothers has become commonplace. I try to remain patient with them. But when asked about sportsball or particular players, I always say I am rooting for the team with the White QB or the team with more White guys. The squirming is more entertaining than the game.

                It used to be an unspoken rule in European and South American soccer that the “crowd” camera man would focus in on the most attractive female.  It was put into overdrive for international tournaments.  That seems to have diminished, if not disappeared altogether (maybe they are just not there?).

                More common than cameramen focusing on the dorkiest fans is them focusing on white fans acting like nuggras, what with the gyrating and idiotic gesticulation of the arms. Even better if they’re proto-twerking in the company of an actual nuggra. Sportsball has become a ceremonial celebration of nuggratude.

        ‘Of course, the ultimate false choice, the very heart of American conservatism, is the assertion that they cannot use the same tactics as their opponent or exact revenge when they have power, because that would make them as bad as the left.’This is the problem, exactly.  But the primary reason WHY ‘conservatives’ NEVER punish the Woke-Fem Politburo for tyranny and totalitarianism is because the Right is masculine and the Left is feminine.  It ain’t Whites vs. Others.  It’s male vs. female.  And modern Western men do not have the stones to punish their daughters, wives, or women holding collective power and fiat.  They quail and rationalize and compromise and fail.  Conservatism Inc.Best recent example: First thing Donnie did after his election victory was ‘pardon’ Hillary Clinton, backing completely away from his campaign ‘You should be in jail’ rap.  So, yet again: a ‘masculine’ male finally takes power . . . then simps and wimps and doesn’t do what needs doing.Therefore the problem merely persists, and never can be solved, or even addressed.  Eventually the Woke-Fem Junta regains total power, and then your saggy old ass is indicted, your followers jailed indefinitely without due process, and your base targeted by the Junta Administration as insurrectionists and criminals.  Mr. BigTalk retreats to Mar-a-Lago.Around ‘n around the ole ball spins.  Men never learn.  Look at the type of males allowed to be ‘impact conservatives’.  It’s Jonah Goldberg and Prager University weenies, fer as the I kin see.Groundhog Day Nation.

So, if we tame the women, do you believe that a multiracial society can work?  If so, what happens when a group of blacks demand proportional representation among surgeons or pilots?

They wouldn’t. Black men don’t have words like “equity” or “proportional representation” in their vocabulary. They may demand gibs, but not “proportional representation.” Have you ever been around blacks? They are very matriarchal. All of the activism in their communities is entirely driven by the women.
Or, more likely, the activism is being imposed on the black community from the outside (also mostly women.)

                Line:  I cannot speak for ray, but I would think that if White men rediscovered the testicular fortitude to control women (specifically their wives and daughters), they would then naturally regain the discernment and will to control the aliens amongst them.  Both the agitators and their golems.While feminism is to blame for a multitude of sins, I believe it was one of the main channels utilized by those who sought to undermine White civilization.  They’ve utilized more violent means and races as well, but I do believe women have been the key node – precisely because of their control over men via sex, and their influence over  their children.

This is correct.  Restore authentic and strong masculine leadership, most of the rest falls into place on automatic.

                LITS —Thank you for asking.A multi-racial society does work . . . in heaven.  This place?  Not so much.What got this big rock in trouble from the jump was the woman/hierarchy issue.  Females seeking to usurp the place of God and men, and males wimping ‘n simping.  Doing what women want instead of what God wants.So, obviously, fix the systemic flaw first, at the fundamentally dualistic center.  Race is not at the fundamentally dualistic center. Then a whole bunch of stuff will sort ITSELF out, via restoration of masculine leadership and authority.No interventions necessary.  As things did in Fifties America, when I was young, and the feds (collective feminine) were exponentially weaker.  MEN ran the smaller and midsize towns.  Not women, as is usually now the case.Full disclosure, I’m Christian so I’m a monarchist.  I already know peeps will never solve their own problems.  I work to prepare for permanent monarchy, and that work spills over into benefits for restoration of my nation.  If the nation refuses it, tra la la I’m outta here, and duck.

            Yes that is the Genesis. The eternal earthy problem of female temptation unbridled by male abdication of headship.The inversion has cured this into the foundation of progressive social status and morality.Until a man divorces from the inversion he will choose to bitterly protect that status and reinforce the morality.To do otherwise is an indictment that cascades all the way back. And we can’t have that. To take the “vote” from my wife and daughters would be unspeakable. And such.I’ve never met a woman who wasn’t an exception. Just like the prog death cult is a monolith but without any individual constituent parts. It just is.The conservative desires to fight in the trenches of incrementalism, to roll back the clock just a bit.To keep Gods knowledge but to let him have a little bit of his authority back because, you know, things got a little out of hand here for some reason.How generous.Chix with dix making my strong daughter have badfeels on the MMA mat is a tench too far.Conservatives are just Big Daddy to the sorority of exceptions. Just keep writing checks to State U to keep the party going.Conservatives seem to be more concerned with guarding the precious of exceptions than answering for their own abdication.The low hanging fruit of the bad commies is where ConInc grazes. But when anyone points to the Genesis, the instinct is to pounce with ire and fire as to how their garden is not among the fallen.It’s an ancient reckoning. But that is the Achilles of modernity. The question of how far back to we go paralyzes us because as Z lays out here, the false dilemma is the ratchet of progress.“If you love her you will set her free”. To chain her to the ancient, to take her rights, to limit her options must be hateful.The Right reared it’s cuckoo head long ago when the manosphere first emerged. Nothing has changed in that regard.

            ” But the primary reason WHY ‘conservatives’ NEVER punish the Woke-Fem Politburo for tyranny and totalitarianism is because the Right is masculine and the Left is feminine.”I think it is the exact opposite. Acceptance of false premises as a means to achieve compromise is the ultimate feminine move. Modern conservatism is drenched in estrogen. It is its Achilles heel.I agree the specific programs and goals the Left advocates are “feminine” in the sense they are anti-male, but their means to attain their goals are quite masculine: set out the terms and force opponents to accept those parameters.The problem is the Left is a throbbing penis and the contemporary Right receives it with provisos that often don’t even include dinner. Even though he failed consistently to follow through with action, Trump rhetorically rejected the premises. That’s the reason he was hated. Imagine if he actually did anything substantive.The male delivers the terms, the female decides how to accept them. Which of those is the Left?

                Agree – the left may talk feminine but acts more masculine because it is effective – look at what they are doing (and will do) to Trump; look at what they did with Summer of Floyd and J6ers.  The right talks masculine but acts feminine – extremely ineffective.  Hasn’t accomplished a thing of note in decades.
The left wants to eliminate its opponents; the right wants some faggoty “coexistence.”

‘Modern conservatism is drenched in estrogen. It is its Achilles heel.’
Obviously, both Left and Right are ‘drenched in estrogen’.  And yes, the modern Left uses masculine hyper-aggressiveness, intimidation and violence to achieve its ends.
But that’s a given, as the Left is largely a bunch of women wanting to be men, and failing.  They’re aping of masculinity is guaranteed to be tyrannical, totalitarian, and inverted.  An  onion isn’t a Jeep Wrangler.
I’m not sure where you are disagreeing with me but, whatever.

        I read Rufo’s tweet. It’s impossible to win elections or build a base of support talking like this. Nobody really cares about Griggs vs. Duke Power Company unless it is your job to care about it. Guys like Rufo have no answer when some BLM activist calls him a racist besides stammering under his breath “no…. I’m not….”. This is one reason why the conservative always loses. People vote for the conservative nerd who talks like this and assume he is going to take care of it, because the voters are either too stupid or too busy to care about all these details. Well, the conservative doesn’t take care of it, and nothing happens. This is why people like, sorry Z, Nick Fuentes, are building support amongst zoomers and alphas. They talk in clear and definitive language. They don’t mince words. They say that White people deserve to have a home of their own and don’t want to live in a non-White country and deserve a say in it. That’s really it. It’s simple language that people up and down the IQ spectrum can grasp, and more importantly, people intuitively grasp as fair. Of course you can’t say that and get the sinecures that Rufo gets, which is the point.There’s also a false choice here because if you sign up with Rufo’s side, you are also signing up as a Zionist. Chris Rufo was instrumental in getting Claudine Gay fired after Bill Ackman targeted him. So the political system as is tells you to either throw your lot in with black and Hispanic activists who want you dead, or Jews who want you dead. You’re basically the deciding the timeline in which you and your family are raped, killed, and your graves are desecrated.

Rufo will have to contort himself to promote this reversion to the mean, but he will do so on command.

                Glenn Greenwald has made this case explicitly on recent shows. They have no interest in abolishing DEI, just expanding it to make sure it includes Jews. This was made obvious and explicit when Jonathan Greenblatt and the ADL made a principled stand to ensure that Jews are counted as a diverse group in a field that they have long struggled to gain representation in, that being entertainment and Hollywood. Rufo is going to be left out in the cold when Ackman tells him “nah, we’re good with DEI, go away LMAO” and wondering where it all went wrong, as so many other conservatives have over the decades when they thought aligning with Jews was the smart tactical play at the time.

It is not unlike the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians being applauded while the far-less inhumane Ukraine war, in the sense of massacring civilians, is held up as the ultimate exemplar of evil.My favorite part of this episode so far was when Ackman’s wife also was exposed, likely by MIT, as a plagiarizer, and the lame defense has been “don’t attack family members!” There is a chance this becomes too acrimonious to result in an exception carved out. That’s normally not the way to be but thus far it is where this is going.

Meh. Never been big on thetu quoquefallacy. I don’t have any idea who Ackerman or his wife are, but I’m guessing he didn’t propose to her on the basis of her academic writings.

                    Hollywood establishing a jewish quota can only reduce the number of jews working in tinseltown. I don’t see any other way that can play out. The recent cry for one appears to be a signal of how retarded the hollywood jews have become.

                    That is the goal, it is no longer possible. Various groups, Diverse, Alphabet+, Woke Upper Class White women, are not going to let (((certain people))) back into power after they have been purged mostly: Hollywood, Academia, Government, much of Finance, etc.Ackman is running scared, he knows independent hedge funds are next on the list. There is an ever growing amount of the Diverse and ever fewer places for them to be Big Shots at; having won the victories over Dirt People it would always escalate to (((big shots))).Look at say, Disney. Who is directing the new Star Wars movie? Some Pakistani activist with zero big budget experience. NOT Steven Spielberg, or some other big time director. Disney is run by diverse and empowered people, not (((people))). That is the logical and inevitable endpoint of DEI. The Diverse get a say. THE say. The (((people))) may have plans, schemes, everyone has a plan per Mike Tyson until they get punched in the face.

                        It’s certainly going in that direction, Whiskey. I normally would bet differently, but not without odds in this case. The Tribe excels at foot-shooting, so perhaps I shouldn’t be as surprised as I am.
Finance indeed is next. Jamie Dimond knows it. Larry Fink knows it. Bill Ackman knows it. Janet Yellen is trying to find an alternative carve out.

        Unfortunately America has a history of “my way or the highway” which was brutally imposed on the indigenous peoples from the time Europeans showed up, until the late 1800’s. To be fair, every expanding empires imposed this method on the locals so this isn’t  criticism, rather a statement of fact.Now the shoe is on the other foot, and the whites are being told it is they who must comply. Europe used to look to the West, and specifically the US, as to what the future held. Now we all have a front row seat to what’s coming into our own back yards.

                The Whites are thriving there?  Never heard that one.  Yes, some Whites remain intact in their reinforced communities, but what about the murders of hundreds (thosands?) of farmers and those Whites now without jobs and living in squalid camps?  Not to mention living under governments that openly threatened Whites remaining with genocide.

        Mao, on his Great March, had to go through a lot of minority areas. He promised them   independence for support. Chinese communism has a phrase that translates “avoid Han Chauvinism!. So China is in theory colorblind, but in practice, not. Same applies to females.
