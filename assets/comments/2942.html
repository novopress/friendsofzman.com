        […] It’s why Donald Trump is getting so much attention. Outsiders have always popped up in party primaries only to fade from the scene. Usually they have a novel idea or represent a narrow constituency. Trump would have been laughed off if he had not had the good sense to say what the public is thinking about taboos subjects like immigration. He’s an American Beppe Grillo. […]

        I’m not sure if I’d vote for Trump, but I’d much rather have him as president than The Grifter, aka Hillary Rodham Clinton. She’s a liar and a corrupt, conniving, thieving, snake in the grass. Trump does a lot of bullshitting in his line of work, but everyone knows it and doesn’t create a Cult of Personality around him like Hillary’s followers do. And Trump has been very successful in business, so it appears he can actually run things. Unfortunately, our unelected 4th branch of government, the bureaocracy, is not going to vanish even if Trump by some miracle wins the presidency. And Trump would tire of that real quick. But I do enjoy hearing him say the things the professional political class won’t say.BTW, I’ve been listening to Howie for years. He’s almost always spot-on, no matter the topic.

        Wise to never dismiss entirely the court jester. The one person who can openly say what everyone is thinking without being reduced to a headless corpse.
Maybe that is Trump’s, er, trump card and his ultimate role in all this. Won’t win, wears a funny hat but tells it like it is.
