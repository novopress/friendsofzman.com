        LOL! Freud is “German” ? All those intellectuals ran away from Germany to US were “German”, you say ? Come  on man, don’t be this cucked and pathetic. It is one thing to suggest that JQ is being overrated sometimes but this is just denying reality and acting like we are all stupid. Really embarassing…

                I just spent two hours with a conservative this weekend. His definition of an American seems to be “if they wanna be here” then They are an American.
i asked him what the difference between legal and illegal immigration was;, he really couldn’t tell me.

            Freud, as he and Jung sailed to the USA: “Little do they know we are bringing the plague.”https://muse.jhu.edu/article/40708
I had forgotten that Jung was with Freud on the ship, which complicates my simple narrative that Freud’s ideas were the plague.
Freud and Jung can be studied as a personification of Chosen-European relations. Jung coined the term “collective unconscious” and wrote in 1934, “The ‘Ary@n’ unconscious has a higher potential than the J3wish.”https://jewishcurrents.org/carl-jung-and-the-question-of-anti-semitism

                A while back I was hanging out with my psychologist friend, and he was talking Freud-Jung. I said something like, “Look, it’s simple, we don’t need to waste breath and brain cells. Freud was Jewish, Jung was Gentile.” He seemed a little caught off guard, makes sense because talking ethnicity is taboo these days. Nowadays he’s talking the evils of multiculti and the failure of diversity. We all come to it in our own way lol.

            Just heard the “German” part of the show and I second your criticism entirely. Something I’ve noticed with many of the early bird dissidents is that they are sort of tethered to their positions whereas johnny come late s like myself keep drifting to more hardline positions as the situation deteriorates. I’ve opposed the JQ as fantasy, defended “all men are created equal” and Lincoln and defended Churchill as the savior of the West on this site. I would do none of that today. It’s a sad fact that many og those who greet you as you climb ashore on this side of the great divide are still hanging around the river bank as you move inland into the wilderness of more “extreme” dissent. Here Z stepped in a cow pie with “the Germans” just like Derbyshire did about Kevin MacDonald long ago. Both are “river bank”, if not “midstream” positions to me. This is still a great site, both because of the host and many of the regulars commenting here. But the gab I felt between myself and Z when I heard the German part is not because Z moved but because I – and the greater situation – did.

            This is seriously delusional. “Early Lifers” (I’m guessing) argue that Freud’s Jewishness was the cause of his (wrong, IMO) psychoanalysis, yet Marcuse’s Jewishness was somehow ignored when he was criticizing Freud?
Why isn’t Marcuse a f’ing Jew? Other than he came to a conclusion you like, I mean?

                That all of the chosen are not always in agreement is not a refutation of the thesis that they almost all agree of the strategy of white dispossession. They disagree on tactics and that is what you are throwing dust up about.
Before WW2, it was understood that the highest priority of each chosen was, “what is good for our group?” That they don’t all arrive at the same answer does not mean that they don’t start from the same question.

                                    We only know the name of Marcuse because he was easily the most pernicious of the Frankfurt School critical theorists. He was not and never will be considered a philosophical advocate for whites. That’s just ridiculous.

                        Steve, this is like championing the law-abiding black guy in your neighborhood who takes care of his lawn.
In both cases, they are outliers, but probably not as much as you might think. If one of their own does harm to the values of whites, in many cases, you will be surprised when they take the side of the bad one of their own.
And their kids will probably revert to the mean of their group anyway.

                            “In both cases, they are outliers…”
How would one know?
More importantly, why not just get out of blast radius? I don’t really care which is true because I don’t live there. If that changes, I’ll re-evaluate. Your AO, your monkeys.
In my community, they had to change the rules. Black representation had to be proportional to the local population. That meant about 1/45 or so. Obama changed that to mean 1/7, because that was the national average. I moved. I’ll move again if need be.

                                There are always sincere outliers but their numbers are so few that it is impractical to worry about them.
Certainly there were Germans under Hitler who rooted for the Allies.  Have you ever criticized the Allies for not expending resources to save those Germans?
Certainly there were Southerners during the Civil War who favored the North.Have you ever criticized the North for not expending resources to save those Southerners?

                    Agreed. Not so much the “filthy Jew” part but the idea itself was caustic to American society as it existed.
Would it really have mattered if it were the filthy commies from Cuba who did that? Because they certainly did. And while you can find only a few wearing Marcuse t-shirts or Freud t-shirts, there are a crapton wearing Castro or Guegvara.

        Looks like a lot of commenters made this point before me, but I must add my 2 cents’ worth:  Freud and most of the other degenerates, kooks, and intellectual troublemakers were not primarily German.  They may have been living in Germany, but they were Jews first and foremost.    Germany was their victim/host, which they bled to the point of cultural ruin, aka the Weimar Republic.  Eventually those Jews and their descendants came to the USA, and began making the same mischief here, with the same disloyalty to the host culture (ours!) they displayed previously.  The nation that produced Bach, Beethoven, Goethe, Gruenewald, and Duerer deserves better from you, Mr. ZMan.

            “Looks like a lot of commenters made this point before me, but I must add my 2 cents’ worth…”.So will I.  Yeah, Z, you really whiffed on that one. S.V. and several others before said it best: the vast majority of those “kooks” and “bad apples” that fled to America were NOT Germans.  The genuine first-generation Germans that came here contributed mightily to manufacturing and science – men like Werner von Braun, Adolphus Busch, Levi Strauss, Johan Roebling and countless others.  Worst people in human history, indeed.  Maybe it was a tongue-n-cheek comment that flew over my tiny brain.  I hope so.

        Yesterday I suggested abundance was responsible for the decadence and depravity of the contemporary West. Those who replied to the comment agreed. Here’s another suggestion: social media has rocket-fueled the malignant narcissism Z described in his darkly funny podcast today. Social media is inherently feminine, and brings out the very worst aspects of it, including forced social consensus, rank madness, general bitchiness, and passive-aggressive competition. There are other factors that contribute to the magnified malignant narcissism, of course, but all of them combined are less of a factor than social media.That is not to say inane psychosis like Queer Botany has not been a thing for a long time, but the ability to evangelize online has made this type of derangement a plague in that it allows women and feminized men to spread the madness at an increased velocity and to an ever-larger audience. There is a great deal of overlap with Puritanism, but as you notice with, say, the Charlottesville Jewess, the infatuation with the self is so off the charts it would have made Cotton Mathers blush. It isn’t so much extreme individualism as its near opposite, an attempt at forced conformity to a group madness, which again reeks of a hyper Puritanism. If collapse is the cure, as some claim, that will prove true only if Wi-Fi ceases to exist.If there is any tangible proof of a literal Satan, it is TikTok and its mother, Facebook.

                Yes. People bristle when leftism is referred to as a religion, but it is and the need to recite the correct creed is always a paramount concern. It is why they do not view a 180 on a given issue to be hypocrisy or inconsistent. The Truth is whatever the consensus of their Tribe is on any given day. Right wing echo chambers have a lot of problems, too, but fear of deviation from The Truth is not among them, even though conformity is big there, too.

            Jack, you mentioned the rat experiments yesterday and I’ve always been interested in exactly what conclusions could be drawn from them. They weren’t controlled experiments so although abundance may play a large role, that couldn’t be all there is to it. What happens when wild populations experience abundance in nature? There is a temporary population explosion followed by a just as rapid collapse as resources run dry. In the rat experiments there was the initial population explosion but there was also overcrowding of the population under circumstances that don’t happen in the natural world. In both cases, however, there is eventually a spatial constraint as range becomes overextended and the same result is achieved, in one case self-imposed. But in confinement, there is also the emergence of widespread mental pathologies in rat society.Is that what we’re seeing with human populations as the Earth itself is viewed as a finite range? If so, then it may be that a Hidden Hand is at work to cull that portion of the human herd we call the Gaia cult.The Gaia cult may just be the most direct manifestation of an underlying pathology among many others as the population has skyrocketed since the first Earth Day. But that is about to change it seems as women stop having babies just as the rat females stopped having babies. What is a little disturbing is that in the case of the rat experiments, the population didn’t drop to a small number of survivors as it would under natural conditions, it dropped to zero as predictably the rat females decided to stop having babies altogether. Thankfully though, 100% of humans don’t accept the beliefs of the Gaia cult as dispositive. Hopefully, we will have enough unbelievers in Gaia to continue on with our civilization, by making the necessary adjustments. One adjustment might be the selection of ten of the fittest females for every fit male, which although this has become unfortunately linked with “fascism”, might just be the ticket.

                Great comment, and a lot to chew on there. I’ll confine it to these right now:Thankfully though, 100% of humans don’t accept the beliefsIt comes down to who the exceptions are. Unfortunately, the percentage of Gaia unbelievers is far higher in places outside of Europe, North America, and Australia and New Zealand and the cone countries in South America. Propaganda works only on populations with the intelligence to apprehend what is being pushed along with a moral compass that drives a person to do what is perceived, even wrongly as in this case, as the right thing. Among the tragedies that will follow demographic replacement is a collapse in conservation efforts, which are very much a white thing, Japan somewhat of an exception. The ridiculous Gaia worship will evaporate along with the admirable conservation efforts as the white population declines.What happens when wild populations experience abundance in nature?The best guess I can offer, and it is purely speculative, is what we see in the urban/rural divide even in places with abundance. The places with greater population density seem more prone to madness, but maybe that is due to more prosperity. As a counter, abundance causes mammals to overpopulate and then sometimes commit mass suicide, particularly rodents like squirrels and the signature lemmings. It may apply to humans, it may not.

                    As a low-brow aside, I watched a few episodes of Sin City Tow, about tow truckers operating in Las Vegas, every single time, it was low IQ dumfks who tried to use brute force, outright lies, or emotional anger to get the driver to drop the vehicle, not once did anyone admit they had parked in the wrong spot and accept consequences of their own actions, although the vast majority were poc’s, I still fear for us all. Imagine trying to negotiate terms with any of them on any issues. Screaming and threats seemed to be what works for them

            Personalities are determined at conception.The purpose of Designated Bullies is to become char-broiled human hamburger meat when the nerds activate the PETN [explosives] in the Designated Bullies’ iPhones &amp; Androids &amp; Pagers.You can’t alter inalterable personalities.Personalities gonna personalize.Very very brutally.PS: The mere idea of masturbatoriums, and masturbating to death the shiksas in the idyllic summer camps, is nothing but Freudian Projection wielded upon the entire race of German Christians at large.Germans are [by nature] so classically inclined that they can’t even do porn correctly.Have you ever seen German porn? It’s simply embarrassing. Germans could never have envisioned something so grotesquely anti-human as masturbation machines.NB4 all the feminazis start demanding free masturbatoriums.Let’s just hope they don’t put the PETN in the masculine appendage of the masturbation machines.That would be horrifying.Probably shouldn’t be putting any ideas into their heads.

            “Bully” implies masculinity, and this is rank feminism. Granted, women are by far the worse at pecking one another into social compliance, but take it much further into all realms of life. In fact, the abundant soy boys have indeed been bullied relentlessly by feminism.

        And they wonder why it’s common for Americans to have an “anti-intellectual” streak.  Mine’s a mile wide at this point.  I have more respect for an unschooled hillbilly than for these over-educated loons.  At least the hillbilly might have some practical knowledge to share.  Talking to these Xirls risks making a person dumber – one of their nonsensical notions might get past the filter.  Schools should be weeding these people out, not making mors of them.
How do we get rid of these people?  I suppose we just have to wait for collapse and let nature take its course.

            While if would be nice to see Trump win, I think he’s already performed his most useful function, which was as a catalyst. Another term, which would still be preferable to the alternative, probably won’t make a lot of difference, but could still be a lot of fun.

                Fun, but dangerous…  Biden has shown the the world that the USA is a true paper tiger. Our enemies are emboldened. The political world Trump reenters is not the one he left wrt USA’s credibility and power.  Trump touts–even today–his ability to sit down with the major powers and play “poker”, but he has no hold cards. In history previous, this has lead to precipitous wars.

        I see it another way. Western civilization took a wrong turn two centuries ago, when it based the entire culture in two absurdities:Freedom: All men should be free (completely impossible in any possible universe, the freedom of one man is the lack of freedom of another man, my freedom to have property is your lack of freedom to enter my property, for exemple). This is a contradictory statement, similar to “all circles must be squared”, “married bachelors exist”, etc.Equality: All men are equal (this could be possible in a possible universe, but it is obviously false in this universe). This is a false statement, similar to “the Sun revolves around the Earth”, which could be true, but it happens to be false.These were elevated to a sacred status, being the two abstract goddesses behind the religion created by the Enlightenment.At the beginning, these absurd ideas were completely theoretical and life went on by applying common sense, which is opposed to freedom and equality. But intellectuals started noticing that parts of the reality did not conform to these sacred ideas (“unprincipled exceptions”, as the late Laurence Auster called them). Little by little, they tried to force parts of reality into these insane ideas: universal suffrage, feminism, multiculturalism, LGBTI, etc. So you get all the leftist causes. This, of course, was impossible but, if you1) Threw lots of money and make regulations to pretend that all men are free and equal.2) Pretend that the gains produced by 1) were “progress” and that entire freedom and equality would be achieved in the future.3) Produced all kinds of rationalizations why, even with that, reality does not conform to freedom and equalityYou could make believe that these ideas were true so your liberal religion could be saved. Of course, the real solution would be to adopt a sane religion but this is unthinkable so Western civilization is becoming a mental hospital, while trying to extract the insane conclusions of these two absurd premises and trying to ignore that all this is opposed to reality. Between these insane ideas and reality, Western people have chosen to ignore their “lying eyes” and live in a world of insane fantasy.Woke “research” is only an example of 3)

            If you examine things, they turn out to be surprisingly discoverable. Philosophy, Reason, basically.
Time points in one direction. History, i.e., Progress. The Hebrew thing.
Combine the two and you get Christianity, but Faith goes against Reason and Progress. That appears to be a contradiction.
Supposing we didn’t give credit for ourselves to Athens and Jerusalem, it might not be such a problem. Not even a third way, just that we’re something different. Idk, just my opinion.

                Think you are on the right track. If faith, reason and progress are in disunion, it’s something in your beliefs.
God wants the best for His kids. He gave us reason to understand the world we see. Progress? Satan prides himself in hiding the Truth in plain sight. So why might faith and reason disagree with progress?…

        “Instead, the work is more seriously crazy, as in claims that time itself is a result of oppression and whiteness. They appear to have moved on from claiming that Western culture is a conspiracy by the pale penis people to oppress embodied coloredness and people of uterus, to questioning reality itself. Even though it is loaded with insider jargon, the point of many papers is to question space-time.”These morons learnt about “social construction” and have run with it ever since.You’re probably familiar with the Sokal hoax of 1996. The author of the piece eventually came clean and admitted it was a deliberate hoax but the people today are in deadly earnest. If you ask these morons to define the spacetime continuum or explain what intrinsic curvature means, they’ll be lost. They can’t even differentiate sin x. But ask them how spacetime is socially constructed and they’ll be spouting endlessly. There’s even an online “postmodernism generator.” There’s something wrong with these people and with a culture that tolerates them and in some cases even writes their paycheck.

Much of what we stare at, aghast, in Clown World, is simply the byproduct of postmodernism’s conquest of the social sciences/humanities, and its creation of change agents who’ve gone into corporate, government, media, and Hollywood, and implemented what they absorbed in college.

                I’m all for knowing the books and getting them right because I think Whiteness™ was great and the pomos were the last great academic exemplars of it, but it doesn’t matter or help us.He got there via an unlikely path—by following his own work—but Foucault was “always already” an American-style libertarian. People who stole the bodies-and-spaces rhetoric from him (third hand) are not. Writers who cite him rarely show any understanding of his work (analogous to “woke Christians”). Knowing him tells us nothing aboutthem, and they’re the problem.Derrida’s philosophy demands radical dissidence, but in real life and as a mass media entity he was a normal “Atlanticist” shitlib. The first news of his death headlined him as “prominent Bush critic”—rightly, because his academic work didn’t matter at all. It was the credential stamped on his normalfag Our Democracy opinionating. When his work and being a shitlib conflicted, you must have misunderstood the text. It was a globohomo press release all along. If he were still here it’d be in the form of Dick Cheney apologia. Cheney as ideal hated insider-outsider uniquely understands the all-racial laughing transcen-dance of Kamala. She seems drunk and retarded to you because white people don’t recognize rapture, don’t know whatecstaticmeans. “Dick” knows it means tomake firm. Trump has gone full Hitler cuz she gave him a boner. (Actual shitlib opinion by the way.)Etc.Books good, politics bad. The academic-corporate milieu/quicksand is post-philosophical, not postmodern. The usual suspects were condemned and ejected for whitenessdecades ago. Claims of textual ancestry are WE WUZ KANGZ lies.

                    Foucault was an overt homosexual who argued that criminality was rebellion against oppression, and that mental illness was nothing more than a stigma imposed upon the weak by the oppressors. Was he a libertarian of a sort? Perhaps. But given that libertarianism is arguably a Leftist deviation, I’m not going to give him points for that.

The point being that Foucault, like the vast majority of heauxmeaux, was an advocate for perversion. Do you enjoy the depravity of living in AINO? Then lay a bloody wreath at Foucault’s grave.

        John Carter is the Warlord of Mars.  He is a character from a book series that started with a book called “A Princess of Mars”  My handle, Tars Tarkas is also a character from this series of books.  He is an immortal earthling who was sent to mars by a drugged astral projection (IIRC, it’s called that).   Very fun series of books.

        My take on “questioning reality”, which seems to go along with “we are living in a simulation/computer program” (my personal take, tell me more, you have far from sealed the deal) is yet another way to flee responsibility.  If we are in a simulation, it suggests either or both preordination of our behaviors or “it doesn’t matter anyway”.  The shedding of one’s responsibility for one’s actions is what I get out of it, which is the baseline for quite a few poses and behaviors of people today.

        A few points here:1) Darryl Cooper has been getting a lot of attention these days, but there’s another great historian that our side should look into on YouTube. Zoomer Historian. Phenomenal channel. He primarily looks at interwar and WW2 Europe. Xirl science reminded me of an episode of his where he did a deep dive into the books that the Austrian Painter Party actually burned, and it was a lot of this stuff discussed here.2) Sustainability actually does have meaningful application, the kooks just use it in ways that make no sense. For example, in the Philippines, it’s common practice to use dynamite to fish. This devastates the population of fish and coral reefs. It turns the area barren and is unsustainable. Another example, the Haitians famously cut down all their trees for lumber export in the middle of the 20th century. Now the entire land is arid and barren. You can clearly see the difference between Haiti and the DR from satellite images. Rotating crops allows the land to continue to be harvested. So there are sustainable and unsustainable practices.3) I actually have some respect for Ibrahim X Kendi because he openly talks about/recognizes what his philosophy advocates. His direct quote from multiple interviews is, “the only way to correct the effects of past discrimination is through current discrimination.” When you point out the numerous cases of outright discrimination against whites, most leftists put themselves through mental gymnastics to not see it as discrimination. Their mind and programming literally won’t allow them to see outside of the framework of how they were taught the world works.

        Ah, I’ve missed the xirl science….  I guess this show highlights the idea, (with all due respect to the female commenters here) that giving women a loud public voice, probably beginning in the 19th century, was a fair boondoggle. Paying attention to these myriad blatherings has been a huge waste of time (although often humorous lately) at best, and at worst, a recipe for disaster – which seems to be coming to fruition.

                A chick I know went to a very liberal college in the 90s. On campus there was a pond full of ducks that the students liked to watch. She said that during a certain season, the male ducks would pursue reproduction with the females and it was far from consensual or gentle. She said the human women were mad at the men during that time.

            This is a serious issue. Living beings who have been designated at  “hatching” as belonging to the class Aves are being systematically “pigeonholed” out of the class Mammalian. It is clearly intersectional lactatonormative classism which these brave lactating chickens are fighting against.Truly a ‘class’ struggle.
I’m very troubled about how quickly I came up with this crap.

                You can’t choose between male and female characters in corporate video games anymore, only “body type 1” (square-jawed woman) or “body type 2” (soy-made man).
Next stop: anality type.

        Is this really any different than the entire Matrix terminology, including “glitches” and “unplugging from the Matrix”
As for questioning space-time itself, physics is doing this too when it considers that space-time dies in a black hole and this cosmos itself may have began out of a black hole.
So yes, one can sanely make the argument space-time is an illusion, this entire cosmos itself is an illusion and reality is timeless.

        “…the material seems different now. On the one hand, it is less flamboyantly nutty than I remember. There are far fewer articles that read like satire on the grievance studies rackets.”
Never having read the trash in these “journals” it’s hard for me to judge.  But could it be that these journals are cleaning up their act a bit?  Accepting articles that are “flamboyantly nutty” has exploded in their face since those articles are used by the “non-woke” opposition to discredit their cause.
