        […] finally here! That’s right, here is my annual prediction post. Last year’s post can be found here. Reading it over, I’m surprised to see I got a lot of them right or at least close enough to […]

        If Trump makes it, Zman, perhaps you could use your enormous influence within the District to make me Secretary of HUD. My plan is to democratize Section 8 housing, no matter the costs, into neighborhoods with minimum $500k household income. I predict that unexpected and miraculous things will follow suddenly.
My own culturally enriching experience with  Section 8 townhouse neighbors only ended when they burned the place down one night. Too drunk they were to awaken from an inferno, it was I who called the FD in time to save them for partying another day. Mistakes were made.

            Dunno if you read my post on “Honeysuckle”, but welcome to the party.
You got a great idea there.
Oh, and let Baltimore burn to the ground before Mr. TelePrompTer get out of town.

        If Turkey and Russia go to war, lets hope the USA and NATO do NOT get involved at all and just let these two guys go at each other.Erdogan is an ISIS supporter because ISIS wants to kill Kurds (enemy #1 of Turkey) and Iran (enemy #2 of Turkey).ISIS sells oil to buyers IN Turkey; Turkey allows and encourages this. And if not for the revenue the oil brings in, ISIS would  be in a world of hurt.By the way, get on google maps, search for Raqqua, Iraq (the ISIS stronghold), switch over to the “air-photo/earth” view.You will find that Raqqua is a very small town with about half a dozen roads leading in / out, and the terrain is all desert; flat as a pancake; no place to hide anything.If any nation wished, an intense bombing campaign, IN ONE DAY !!!, could destroy all the roads in/out of that town, EVERY oil tanker truck and pretty much wipe that town off the face of the earth; IN ONE DAY !!!Check it out.Now ask yourself, “why has this not been done?”Something is afoot here, but I have no idea what it is; but clearly Russia, UK, France, Jordan, the USA, etc., does NOT want to destroy ISIS.

            “If Turkey and Russia go to war, lets hope the USA and NATO do NOT get involved at all and just let these two guys go at each other.”
Amen, but we are pinwheeling at the edge of the cliff as long as the present administration, aided and abetted by Congress, remains in power. In the current inverted moral universe, the potential for going to war to “protect Islam” is all too real. 1914, forsooth.

        It’s highly likely that ((they)) don’t want to trigger a crisis in the equity markets because it would strengthen Trump.  The rise of the National Front in France was defused by the simple expedient of having Leftists withdraw candidates so that their cucks (Fr. coq) could prevail, but they’re well aware that economic crisis proves a fertile petri dish for fashy bacilli.  Gunter Grass’s famous quip that “the long shadow of fascism is always falling in the United States but only lands in Europe” may have reached expiry.

        My prediction will be that the earth will continue spinning round the sun for the full 366 days during which the numerous (but not numerate) tiny mites that roam its surface will scurry about as if there was some purpose to their existence while emitting noxious gasses from both ends, which in turn will prove to be the real cause of climate change.
Other than that, I predict much the same as we saw in 2015.
