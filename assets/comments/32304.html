        Just a note on the perverse con inc subversion of Brexit. Brexit was a referendum/movement based almost entirely on the fact that Britons wanted to take control of their immigration policy and stem the tide of mandatory refugee resettlement outlined in EU policy. The conservatives reframed it that Britons wanted to leave the EU because it was too racist, and didn’t allow for enough refugee resettlement, and they wanted MORE. Hence the sheer tidal wave of the last 3 years. These people are pure evil, and we’re not voting our way out of this problem.

            Marko:  Instead of a flood of Poles (and I like Poles but they ought to be home working to make Poland great instead of taking jobs in England) they’ve just gotten more Pakistanis and Nigerians.  Even if all immigration stopped tomorrow, the future for France, Germany, and England – like the US – is total population replacement given birth rates and age cohorts.  Short of massive repatriation (and whatever bloodshed and/or violence that would require), there is no way our children are going to be able to avoid dealing with this.  Voting is far too little, far too late, and ultimately meaningless.

            I can’t help but notice the parallels between Brexit and Trump’s term.
It seems like addressing the problem of massive immigration was one of the primary motivations of both campaigns, if the not the biggest motivation.
But once Farage and Trump took the helm, it was as if immigration was mostly forgotten.  What became most important was proving to the world that the conservatives love the blacks more than the liberals.

                When exactly did Farage “take the helm?” The Tories co-opted his movement in exactly the way Z described.

                    The problem with European-descended societies is they have succeeded almost TOO well. The water is clean, the traffic lights work 100% of the time and when they don’t there’s a friendly cop to wave you on by, the factories are churning out massive amounts of food and goodies (much of which is imported from foreign lands using Western know-how).Driven by natural human need to find safety in a world of scarcity, the 3rd world immigrant invites himself and his whole extended family to join him using liberal repatriation laws. The powers that control the West have long ago decided that he is a good thing to have around, so they open the entry queues to floodgates levels, as we’re seeing in Canada now (one million new entrants in a population just shy of 40 million in one year).There is no attempt at recruiting new citizens from Europe. Too white. We want DIVERSITY. Right?— Greg Nikolic (www.dark.sport.blog)

                        Don’t forget that the West is in many cases dislocating these third world immigrant families by creating unnecessary strife for them in their mission to reshape the world.

                Once Trump was up pumping his fist, he was pumping his along with everybody else in the crowd. So maybe he’s one of those jews for Trump. They exist.

            The police are saying that the shooter is named, “Mark Violets”.
But my guess is that the shooter’s real name is a whole lot more like “Menachem Volet”.
VOLET is a very very j00ish name.

                Do you feel a little silly now, after running around shouting “J3w!”? I imagine that it felt good in the moment, but that you regret it now.
Don’t get me wrong, running around shouting “J3w” is one of the most productive things that we can do right now, but you’ve got to be accurate or you lose credibility.

        I know you were using the Borg as a metaphor, but it still has me thinking about the actual entity in the “Star Trek” films. Probably because I just watched one of the less bad films, “First Contact,” which deals almost exclusively with the Borg.“Star Trek” has always been considered progressive—a notorious early adopter of the stunt casting that has grown to be so abominable of late; there were some heavy-handed lectures in there, too. But there was always, in the first iteration at least, an unapologetic strain of the pioneer spirit to it. Kirk was a white man while Picard was more of a white guy.The Enterprise crew lost some of this strain (I think you called them a space bureaucracy or something like that) but the Borg is still a curious villain for supposed lefties and progs to pick. The loss of individual ego, the assimilation into the hive, seems to encapsulate the beau ideal of what the left wants, or at least claims to want. From both the Buddhist perspective—we all merge into one as we downward dog on the yoga mats—and in the more collectivist political outlook, it’s about the water bead assimilating stray beads until you have a puddle. Obama’s “You didn’t build that,” is maybe just a click or two away from, “Resistance is futile.”The skins game is a team sport, though, so we better find a way to get right with “cliquing up” as they say in the pen. To quote Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson, not the SBPDL guy), “We’re not pioneers anymore.” We’re trapped together in a fort that’s under siege. Even if we want to head to higher ground and explore again, we’ve got to escape blockhouse first, while under fire. A unit is never more vulnerable than when performing a rearguard action. As the few early efforts at secession have proven, they won’t let us leave without a fight.

            First Contact was terrible. All the Next Gen films were bad, but the least bad wasInsurrection.
Insurrectiondeals with a white utopia, where the astoundingly capable hwite inhabitants need to be removed so their ugly cousins can come and suck all the life-force from their homeland.
Then Picard shows up and gives one of his smug speeches about the removal of peoples. We need Picard again to stick up for white homelands!

                Relative to Blade Runner or 2001, maybe. Not relative to other “Star Trek” movies. No one is ever going to confuse Jonathan “Two Takes” Frakes with Kubrick or Scott, but the movie has good FX (especially on the Borg queen) and James Cromwell has fun chewing scenery. He’s one of those character actors always playing white authority figures—sometimes, horror of horrors—actual racists. But he is a pathetic lefty, of the flak-catching type Tom Wolfe wrote about in his famous essay. I’ve seen an interview with Cromwell somewhere where he’s literally weeping about Civil Rights.

                I’m probably the only guy around here who has never seen a Star Trek film or an episode of Next Generation. I do, however, rather like the camp elements of the original TV series. Generally speaking, pop culture from that era–mid- to late-60s–is pretty interesting stuff.

                    I have spent a lot of time lately (old age retirement does that) reviewing much of my early interest in TV.  Hell, I remember our first B/W TV with a *round* projection screen.  😉More often than I’d care to admit, I watch an episode of an old series and remark…”How the hell could you have wasted your time watching this?”, and of course lament the time spent in such which could have been better spent in more fulfilling pursuits.However, I agree.  Watching old shows really does put into perspective societal progression (decline?) over the years.  Especially apparent when one understands the handful of the “usual suspects” whose shows dominated the airwaves in those early (golden) years—late 60’s, 70’s.  It’s trivial to tract the not-so-subtle promotion of the Leftist ideology ascendant today.

You mean brainwashing.  And yes, I’ve have also youtubed old shows i watched when I was a kid and it’s a mind fuck.  I simultaneously think how different it was back then and also ask why the fuck did I think this shit was so impotrant and waste my time on it?!  Youth is truly, TRULY wasted on the young.

                            If you asked me to think of memorable original Star Trek scenes/episodes I’d probably list the famous kiss scene between Kirk and Uhuru and that tedious anti-racist one with the two guys who were half black and half white but on different sides. I actually think the propaganda in that show was easier to spot than it is today because it was a contrast with the better value system of mainstream media at the time.
Today, everything is super ghey and the miscegenation is shoved down your throat in everything. How do you even show how progressive you are nowadays?

                            Yep. Captain Kirk was Jewish. So was Dr. Spock. Never knew that until recently!
The old Star Trek episodes were actually quite good, but in hindsight now I can see the subtle leftist and Jewish undertones, especially inPatterns of Force, in which the crew beams down to a “Nazi” planet and Kirk kicks some Nazi ass.

                        The propaganda in the older shows is far more subtle and sometimes doesn’t even exist at all.  But by the 1960s, pretty much all TV became propaganda.  The same is true of radio, books and magazines.  Some are worse than others, but virtually all of them have propaganda angles, sometimes subtle and sometimes as in your face as possible.

                            Yep.  One despicable aspect of such shows as they progressed from the 50’s through the 70’s and 80’s was the change in the family structure depicted.  Gone were the days of the intact family featuring a (White) hard working, but wise father figure.  In came the days of the (White, Black, or missing) buffoon father figure.
And yes, there were notable exceptions, but they were just that, exceptions.

For that reason–and probably a few others–it has been largely banned.

                            They don’t need to. People memoryhole the past. Few people under 30 will ever watch those shows. Slow-moving 1960s and 1970s shows — prior to rapid jump cuts — are unbearable to watch for people who’ve been raised with a smartphone.It’s immediately evident even to me, an oldhead, that it’s just a group of people in costumes standing on a stage talking to each other until someone tells them to stop. Usually with one or two cameras, max. There’s absolutely no sense that this is “real,” which is the key to generating impression, conditioning, and action upon us, as our subconscious minds usually take the images as real until something breaks the spell.

                                I don’t think a show has to be presented ‘realistically’ to be entertaining or worth watching, but you might be right that it holds less influence or propagandistic power.

                        I tried watching a few episodes as a kid when they first went into syndication, but I thought it was dumb.  My older brother watched them on network TV and loved it and he had all the books too.  I tried reading one of the books, and it was dumb too.  The special effects were all dumb too. The dumb uniforms and automatic hiding doors were dumb too.I am a fan of sci-fi in general. But I cannot help notice the types of people it draws in.  I don’t know how true it is, but I have always heard that pedos are famous for being trekies.   I’ve heard a few cops say they’ve never caught a pedo who wasn’t a trekie.

                            I still find fascinating (as Spock would say) the depiction of modern technology in the first Star Trek series.  Lot’s of blinky lights in vast arrays, but really no view screen as we commonly use today with icons.  Indeed, with the exception of a single on/off switch/button,  I left a computer room at my old department that did not support a single blinky light panel and accompanying mechanical switches.

                            The “trekie” archetype and the incel archetype are basically the same thing. Poor hygiene, morbid obesity leading to being unable to do much of anything other than watch TV, smugness, and a tone deafness for others’ perspectives are the main characteristics of both.It’s probably just that whole array of noxious habits makes it virtually impossible to find a (consensual) sex partner. These types are at high risk of going gay or pedo or both. The juvenal nature of TV sci-fi probably also leads to the occasional presence of children at the few trekie social events. Star Trek can be a good opener for a conversation between adults and kids. Then it’s just a matter of seduction.

                                Nonsense. I was a Star Trek fan until my teens, perhaps never quite a “Trekkie” though. And as I matured (granted, it took alongtime for that to occur) I never felt the inclination towards pederasty or homosexuality, unless you count that awkward weekend encounter with the scouttmaster.

                                    So you were in the Federation Scouts too eh? I always managed to be “sick” for Exploring Sexuality Day. At least back then they taught me to be a crack shot with a phaser and how to cook tribbles. Nowadays they just teach you how to surrender and to start a soybean farm if you’re marooned on an alien planet.

                    Speaking of pop culture from this era, I watched The Graduate (1967) last night. Perhaps it is borderline pretentious to say any film is “important,” but if a movie can be important, The Graduate probably is. Set in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Berkeley in the second half of the 60s, it perfectely and slightly menacingly captures the time and place when America began going off the rails. Simon and Garfunkel’s hauting music adds to the disquiet of this film. I get the sense that The Graduate is pregnant with America’s armageddon.

                            It’s one of the most Jooed up films of all time: Nichols, Henry, Lawrence Turman (producer), Dustin Hoffman, Art Garfunkel, Paul Simon. Now having said that, the film does not particularly cheer for the New Left and the counterculture. In some ways it’s actually a paean to innocence and traditional values. But The Graduate, almost inadvertently, captures the fact that something evil is wriggling to the surface at that time and place. Perhaps it’s my own ideosyncratic view of the film,  aided by hindsight, but it seems to me that there is something foul in the air. But the scent was only vaguely detectable.PS–I know Steve Sailer is viewed with unvarnished contempt in these parts, but he published a very interesting article on The Graduate with Takimag back in 2013. It’s still accessible online if you’re interested enough to read it.

            I always described the Star Trek iterations as pirates in space (Original), then corporate office in space (TNG), then regional office in space (DS9), then finally, HR is space (Voyager).
I agree that the Borg as villain is an interesting thing, given that the people who created it are of the hive mind, but the progressive hive tends to project fears about itself on imaginary villains, so creating such a villain makes some sense.

                Once you realize everything the left says or does about the right is a projection you understand the game. But I have always considered the Borg as leftists. In fact the quintessential leftists since they have not only destroyed the individual but they have achieved destroying every individual they come in contact with. It’s enough to give a Democrat a woody.

                    Borg were written as an empty vessel entity that could be filled with the viewers’ personal projections. Nothing more; it’s lazy writing but enough for a constant primary villain and story archs. The near entirety of the Borg concept fell apart in First Contact when Picard had to deal with an individual crafted by the Borg to represent the Collective.

                TNG was definitely Management In Space.The Federation and the Borg were rival Borgs. The bad one was forthright and the good one was hypocritical/self-deluding. The virtue of the Federation was in its proto-“West Wing” speeches, contradicted by its actions—allnecessary.The lonely agony of the corner office! (Even a round bridge has a corner office.)The one kind of space entity the show had nothing to say about: normal Federation citizens. When later shows purport to fill this gap, theydon’t. They’re about low-ranking Feds, i.e., writers’ “self-insert” complaints about being relative losers within the system, not external subjects/victims of it.The ugly premise of Star Trek was offset by its being a pretty good sci-fi show, up through DS9 or so. Some say Enterprise was the last good series, but I never made it through the theme song. It cured me of a lifetime’s interest in Star Trek in less than a verse.

                    Enterprise was boring. It was an effort to fill in the back story, but these efforts always fail, especially these days when the writing room is full of women and homosexuals.

                        Enterprise ended just as it was getting good, In the series’ final season (Season 4),  Enterprise ended with the prelude to the Romulan War and the founding of the Federation.  Enterprise’s showrunners were saving those two big events in Star Trek history for Season 5, but the series was cancelled.

                    Then you had the “right wing” villain in DS9 as the Dominion.  The founders who un-apologetically viewed themselves as a master race and set out to conquer the galaxy.
Though the “founders” seemed kind of Jewish to me.   Shapeshifters who prefer to infiltrate and dismantle their enemies from within before sending in their chattel servant races to militarily conquer.

                    DS9 was saved by the “prophets”, Bajoran gods. The main enemy they defeated was “the dominion” whose founders were shape-shifting space Jews who viewed all other races as servants.
These “Founders” even had an ancient persecution story which justified their revenge on the rest of the galaxy.

                        Ah yes, The shapeshifting “founders” story was that they lived among “solids” and then gotten kicked out of every planet they tried to live on.  So they set up camp on a fringe rogue planet (space Israel) where they ruled the rest of their empire through servant peoples.

                    I liked DS9 because they had obvious Space Jews (Ferengi), a fascist cop  who would have loved to send them all to space Auschwitz (Odo) and the Bajoran/Kardassian struggle was pretty obviously the Palestinians and Israelis. It’s still remarkable that they got that stuff past the thought police even then.

                    My favorite episode is when Captain Sisko colludes with the Cardassian Garak to engineer an alliance with the Romulans when the Federation’s war with the Dominion is going badly. They use deception, illegal sale of contraband, and murder to achieve the goal. Sisko is abhorred by these tactics but decides that the alliance was worth it. It seemed like a slice of the way the real world works.

“That’s why you came to me, isn’t it, Captain?! Because you knew I could do those things that you weren’t capable of doing?! Well, it worked. And you’ll get what you want: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion. And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant. And all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal, and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer. I don’t know about you, but I’d call that a bargain.”

                    Not only did the Queen ruin the Borg as a villain, but the plot contradicted established Borg motives.
The Borg existed to assimilate advanced technology and they viewed primitive races as unworthy of assimilation.
So what was the point of going back in time to assimilate a pre-spaceflight Earth?
I absolutely hated First Contact, the people who seemed to like the movie are the type who just want phaser battles and don’t want to think.

                “Corporations”, an interesting take that at the time of its airing, I hadn’t considered. To me Picard was more of a diplomat to Kirks “Gunslinging sheriff of the old west” image, more polished if you will. I’m glad they fired the writers after the first season because the whole “avoid violence at any cost” theme of the show was nauseating. That and the new Enterprise, which I didn’t like because it reminded me of a piece of sculpture. The same with the bridge which I thought looked too much like someones living room.

            No entity is more clueless about the Left than the Left itself. This explains why Leftists can create a villain, such as the Borg, that accurately mimics the Leftist zeitgeist. It also explains why Leftists, as a matter of course, project so much. They simply do not understand their own ideology. For them, Leftist simply equals good, and that’s all there is to it.

            Z: “The Borg concept, on the other hand, is an aggressive entity. It sustains itself by seeking out and assimilating new life forms. The process by which it sustains itself is a constant danger to everything around it. Cancer, for example, destroys its host by replacing good cells with cancer cells. The death of the host is not incidental to the existence of cancer, but the end point of it.“joey jünger: “The loss of individual ego, the assimilation into the hive, seems to encapsulate the beau ideal of what the left wants, or at least claims to want.“For peeps who are still struggling for insight into these psycho-sociological phenomena, both Cancer &amp; the Borg are excellent metaphors for understanding the underlying Hive Mind of Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder [PAPD] which propels Managerialism.Whenever the Hive Mind senses Active Aggressive personalities in its midst, those personalities are ruthlessly hunted down and destroyed.Ruthlessly hunted down and destroyed.When you revisit &amp; refresh all of your memories of interacting with castrationiste XX Karens and insufferably back-stabbing XY Gammas, and you then start to analyze those memories from the point of view of Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder, everything finally starts to make sense.Those personalities have no grounding whatsoever in reality as it ackshually exists.They float along in a perpetual motion machine of psycho-sociological meta-malignancy, and the only oncological drug known to put an end to their miscreancy is Active Aggressive physically kinetic W@R.You simply cannot defeat these meta-personalities on their own turf [which is lawfare] and on their own terms [which is legalism].Any Common Law &amp; Statutory Law &amp; which they haven’t already re-written to their benefit, they will stealthily stay up all night long re-writing &amp; passing &amp; signing into law, immediately prior to the convening of the court &amp; the jury to decide the case these personalities need to win the next morning.Only Active [Physically Kinetic] Aggression can defeat Passive Aggression.The Passive Aggressives are so brutally legalistically devious that back in 2013, in an act of Ne Plus Ultra Passive Aggression, they banned the very diagnosis of, “Passive Aggressive Personality Disorder” from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association [aka the “DSM of the APA”].It’s metaphysically impossible to get any more Passive Aggressive than removing the necessary descriptive vocabulary from the dadgum dictionary which would have otherwise defined the usage of the words involved in describing the very concept of Passive Aggression.

        The thing about Project 2025 is that it encourages conservative civilians from outside of politics to fill out a form with all their info.  The form is quite detailed since they claim it will be used for job vetting and secrecy clearance.  The form also includes essay questions where applicants are asked to describe their personal philosophy and thoughts about the direction of the country.Now just imagine some ordinary guy fills in the forms honestly and sincerely.  Suppose he gives certain dangerous answers in his essay questions.This data will not be extinguished after the election.  It will live forever someplace.  All it takes is a “data breach” for this info all to be leaked to “activist groups” and “anti-extremism researchers” i.e. dox rings and civilian partners to the surveillance agencies for future use.Project 2025 is like the Jan 6 rally: dangle to ordinary conservatives the opportunity for lawful popular rebellion, and then identify or trap them.Tens of thousands of people will give away all their info to Project 2025 in the hope of getting a job from Mr. Trump but what they are really doing is writing their own dossier.Very wicked scheme.

            I don’t think Project 2025 is an op. I think the people behind it correctly understand the primary problem with the first Trump administration, which was a people problem. The Trump admin was staffed by RNC losers. They sought to correct it by building a database of capable people ready to work for Trump’s stated policy preferences and goals. Trump tried to do the same thing the first time around, he had a job website. The website was totally ignored by Reince Priebus when it came to job hiring. It essentially said “do not hire these people for government.”Also, while I understand what you are saying, what we are talking about here is pretty standard stuff. I didn’t read all 950 pages but P2025 is a lot of it is boilerplate conservative stuff, and very wonky. It’s not full 1488 no matter what the media paints it as, and nobody filling out the form is going to talk like that anyway. With that, we are never going to get anywhere as long as these doxers and “researchers” have this power over people. We need to get to a point where people are not afraid to say that they believe in the same things Obama said in 2007, or Bill Clinton said in 1991, or hell Joe Biden said in 1978. The good thing is that I don’t think White zoomers care anymore, not like big companies are hiring them anyway.

                You’re probably correct that P2025 is not some devious scheme to entrap the ravening hordes of Blue-eyed Ice Devils. However, the BEIDs are also right to be suspicious. The Power Structure’s surveillance apparatus, after all, is very real and it is worked exclusively against people like us. Fifty times bitten, a hundred times shy.

                    Project 2025 needs to be put into context. It was not some super-secret thing concocted by some shadow people to implement the Handmaiden’s Tale. it was done by the Heritage Foundation, an organization that has been around FOREVER and is basically the default conservative organization in DC and has been forever. It has publicly available tax forms and one can see the funding sources. They put up the PDF for anyone who wants to read it. Hundreds of people contributed to Project 2025 including big businesses and policymakers in the past.if the glowies want to go after a bunch of people who signed up to support Heritage Foundation policy goals, I guess they could try, but they would be going after a lot of people. No, this is, as usual, pure projection from the left. They are the ones who concoct shadowy plans in backrooms, like Norm Eisen’s “Election Integrity Project” of 2020, or the “Russian disinformation letter” from which Blinken got his SoS appointment.And as usual, the left is attacking a bogeyman that they made up and the conservacucks are running scared because the worst thing that can happen is the left calls you names.

                        Such folk, however, are passive enemies of the BFE. Once you go to the point of effectively publishing a non-Leftist manifesto, no matter how half-assed, you go from passive to active, and from the shadows to on the radar screen. Doesn’t mean Men in Black will knock on your door in the dark of night, but it does put you in the gun sights. And they can pull the trigger at their own discretion.

            It’s curious how the Heritage Foundation all of a sudden became a Far Right/Nahtsee org. Up until about two weeks ago it was the boring, staid, establishment “conservatism” of the rinocons and had been for as long as I can remember. Now, practically overnight, it’s dangerous and subversive, a threat to “democracy.”So either….. somehow HF was taken over by “maga” while nobody was looking, or the MSM got the bat signal to rebrand it, and/or it is as you say, this is an op.Nevermind that nothing in Project 2025 would have been thought radical by anyone a mere 15 years ago, and it’s questionable if a majority (of citizens) would find it radical now. That’s a separate discussion altogether.

                    Timing is everything with these people. One of the very few “news” sites I use is something called Market Watch. And one of the reasons I use it is because it has been basically apolitical. All that changed with Joey Depends’ public face-plant. Now Market Watch is pushing the anti-Trump message good and hard. These people are in panic mode and are showing their true colors. Not that I hadn’t suspected they were Leftists all along, of course.

                    I have to give the man credit – he’s no coward.  An inch from death, and he pumps his fist and yells “Fight!”  And if the shot hadn’t missed – would the crowd – or the voters – have done anything other than peacefully protest or write a few congresscritters?  I doubt it.

            “Let the guessing of which agency green lighted this event begin!”Do any of you recall after 9/11 there was some video that you swore you saw, but as time passed, it got harder and harder to find? Things like the news reporter that reported the collapse of Building 7 BEFORE the event took place?Things like them saying “pull it” and then Building 7 magically pancaking into dust?Various other strange videos of people on the scene reporting hearing secondary explosions throughout the building?Allow me to show you the video you will NOT see for very long. The volume is low, I suggest you turn it up because it may be the most important video from this event which means it WILL be memory holed.This guy describeswatching the shooter methodically climb the buildingwith a rifle on his back while “law enforcement” look on passively and they keep telling them LOOK AT HIM. I have saved a local copy of this video because it won’t exist very shortly.https://x.com/philroberts/status/1812265816727212513I also got a bunch of texts from people that said “you called this weeks ago” and I did. I didn’t know the ‘when’ but I was 100% sure this would happen between now and November. They simply will not allow him back in under any circumstances.

Bartleby is right: you go to kill the king you better kill him.  And Sarge is right: this doesn’t glow.  At least not yet.
Reports are the shooting was done with an AR.  Only an asshole would use an AR for a shot like this.

According to Grande, that rooftop was “outside the security perimeter” and thus wasn’t checked or watched. It’s astounding incompetence if true. Unless you want to get conspiratorial, which I really don’t but this kind of stuff makes that REALLY tempting. Sadly, I think this is just more evidence of that crisis of competency that we talk about here so much.

                                    Not only that but you could see that they were in an emotional nervous wreck bubble and couldn’t overcome it, going to and fro, very upset, whereas the men may have some of the same feelings but they can overcome it and tamp it down to do what they need to do at the time. The women couldn’t and it was very obvious.

                                I’ve read that the snipers that shot the would-be assassin WERE securing that rooftop, by sight from another rooftop, and were ordered that they could not shoot first. Probably by the SS.Makes sense because if they started shooting the incompetent SS gun-fumblers might shoot them in a hysterical tizzy.

            Shortly after the event I hopped in my wife’s car and was welcomed by one of the local taxpayer-funded radio stations playing “Who Shot Ya?” by Biggie Smalls, a song nobody has heard for almost three decades.
So, among the TLAs involved: NPR
More seriously, Secret Service seems to have pointedly waited until after the shots to take out the guy—who’d long been spotted by the crowd on the ground. Punishment for failure. If you want it done right… Soon.

                    Never been a fan of Dylan, but I’ve got to hand it to him, his soundtrack for Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid–including “Knocking on Heaven’s Door”–is quite good. As a matter of fact, the special edition of that film (2005) is one of the better Westerns I’ve ever seen.

        My Three Sonswas the last show made in innocence–at least the first season. I have been watching it with dumbstruck wonder, marvelling at the clean, White world it showcases.
Maybe seasons after 1960 became the usual propaganda/ engineering vectors, but the first season conveys morally sound, upbuilding plots and dialogue.
Anyone who sneers at the 50s, or repeats the tired old lies about how that era wasnot,ackshuallyyyyyy, an infinitely better world, can cram it right up his Brainwash hole.

            Yep.  I tire of being told by the savages who now pervade our society that these shows were not “reality” and that such never existed in real life.  That the current generation—their generation—has simply torn the mask of hypocrisy off of society.So what?  These shows revealed what we aspired to as a society coming off the Great War and into an era of prosperity earned by our forefather’s suffering.  As said in the good book, “…we all fall short…”.  The test is not in this era’s “reality”, it’s in whether or not we are a better society in their absence.  I leave you to decide.

        Somewhat OT, or perhaps not Borg like, there was a report released the other day and reported in the FT, on the failure of the Israeli Army to respond to an attack on a Kibbutz near Gaza on October 7.The attack started at about 6:30 AM, and calls went out to the Israeli Army. The Army took about 4 hours to organize itself and get to the outskirts, where they milled about and did nothing for another 4 hours until finally staging an assault on “militants” holed up in various houses. So about 8 hours to actually do something.Borg like, this is just like Uvalde Texas, and Parkland Florida, and Columbine Colorado. It seems the bigger the response team, the more people “organize” and do nothing. Even people with guns will shy away from gunfire.The exceptions I have seen are the video (was online) of the Lakeview Church shooting in Houston Texas (shooter female to male transgender), and the shooting in Nashville downtown (not the transgender shooter at the school). The Lakeview shooting was interesting, there was both body cam and surveillance video. The uniformed cop (fat Hispanic male) first hid behind civilians then he hid in an alcove. And the shooter walked right past him as he was on his phone. Another female uniformed cop advanced, then ran back terrified as she took fire and hid in an another alcove. There was a plainclothes security officer (undercover Alcohol TX cop) who alone, advanced and fired, retreated, and advanced again to fire, several times (perp had an AR-15). Ending the situation but sadly killing the perp’s 8 year old son also. The Nashville shooting had only 2 officers responding and being both Straight White males they went to serious manhunting business.Point being that the Managerial State has a very hard time producing the hard guys it needs to respond to force even when totally and morally justified. The Israeli military is conscript, mostly, and mostly 18-21 year olds whose second cousins at least were in that Kibbutz and yet they did nothing for 8 hours. Food for thought — creating bugmen has consequence and in the land of the cajones-lacking, the one testicular owner is king.

            “…this is just like Uvalde Texas.”Not quite.  The hesitation was on the part of the local command (Uvalde PD) and of course, underscored a failure to anticipate, understand, and therefore *act*.  They were simply not trained in handling this type of criminal act–paralysis through analysis.The hostage situation was handled–quickly and appropriately–by Border Patrol officers who arrived on the scene, quickly discovered the paralysis, and took immediate action through their own initiative.  Result, one dead perp and rescued hostages.In my old university we had the same situation even before this crap became fashionable.  Our College of Nursing had three nursing instructors shot down in three adjoining classrooms.  The campus PD was lucky that the perp could find no more and killed himself.  Even then, they waited around before cleaning up a crime scene no longer active.This changed the entire thinking of the Campus PD.  They then adopted the strategy of immediate action drills which required all PD to respond to reported shootings (M16s in patrol cars now standard equipment, vests, etc.) and to attempt immediate armed incursion into any area where shootings occurred.   This “new” thinking/action was based on the concept of a suicidal shooter wanting to run up a “body count”.  You don’t reason with insanity/evil, you destroy it.  The quicker the better.They were serious as well.  I had the pleasure of watching them perform a training drill in the abandoned building next to mine on campus.  The drill was filmed and I got to see it floor by floor.  There were volunteer students in the old classrooms and lots of flash bangs and the like with students being herded out and police rushing in.Yeah, it was somewhat like a “Chinese fire drill”, but at least something was being done to reach the shooter and eliminate him before the bodies piled up.It can be done.

        Z, I can’t believe you brought up Star Trek’s Borg without mentioning the impact of the character 7-of-9, played by actress Jeri Ryan and her magic tits. Nary a red-blooded male fan of that era wouldn’t have given his left nut to join the Borg and “go where no man has gone before” despite the Borg’s evil ways. Moral of this story . . . an appeal to the amygdala always beats rational analysis in the cerebral cortex. It’s in the DNA.

            I never miss an opportunity to remind people that Jeri Ryan was (with the  possible exception of Penny Pritzker) the woman most responsible for Obama’s political rise.  Without her messy divorce from Jack Ryan, Obama would not have coasted to his Senate seat.  Although maybe the “credit” should go to the L.A. judge who for some reason ($?) disclosed more of the divorce papers than either party had agreed to.

            The world’s most important breasts. It was the leak of her sex-themed divorce filing that destroyed her politician husband’s image and made Obama’s career.
He’d been a treadmilling local failure for years because his handlers kept changing his identity. “Birtherism” was their invention. They pretended he was foreign so he wouldn’t seem like a standard-issuecorruptlocal. Black voters hated him for it. Then they forgot about that, just like they forgot they love Trump, when the tv changed its mind about him.
Obama’s biography has two fully separated halves. The cleavage between them is 7 Of 9’s.

                Yes.  When he attempted to get into the US House of Reps, Bobby Rush crushed him 2 to 1, despite Obama’s heavy support from the White/Jewish liberal node of the Chicago political system.   He won the White vote in Hyde Park but the blacks went heavy for Rush.  Then at least, they knew a phony when they saw one.

        converge:to come together and unite in a common interest or focus – WebsterThe shot at Trump is the convergence I’ve been predicting since Bill Kristol said on Fox prior to the 2016 election that if Trump were to win, they’d use impeachment.  (Wish I had that clip, but I remember it)in any case, my point about convergences was that there would be a narrowing of options leading to attempts on his life.  The Russia hoax never made it to impeachment, but they took two more cracks at it.  Then the phony indictments.  Then calls to kill him grew until pop pop duck yesterday.It was always going to converge like this.  As one Twitter post I read put it about all the calls for “unity” and “no place in our democracy”, “You people literally call him Hitler and a direct threat to our democracy, and NOW you want to say violence is wrong?  At least own it.”  Something like that.

            Propaganda works too well.The average Democrat voter is far ahead of her representatives, who are regular hypocrites, calling “funsies” after their plot fails.But to Jane Onlyfans, the sight of Trump’s blood has heightened her lust to see yours. Normalfag social media is a wall-to-wall call for totalyoudeath. All the sexless soy golems and girls too young to have voted in 2020 demand to see not only Trump but every fascist (normal person) killed on television. And they don’t get banned for advocating mass murder, while you do for saying that an actress is goofy-looking.Maybe it doesn’t matter. Their bloodlust is “public opinion,” which power always ignores. Irony wins?

        Sunday morning in the Midwest, the day after Trump “fell down” and had to be helped off the stage by SS.The MM has no shame, but you already knew that.There is currently a photo showing the bullet in flight that was allegedly captured by a photographer on scene.Don’t know if it’s a fake, but I don’t believe anything at first glance anymore.Finally, Sky news had an American on, and they were recounting about the riots that would ensue if Trump was put down.I don’t believe that for one minute.

Did I just read a good definition of, or rather example of, “mediocrity”?  I think so.  Mediocrity is exactly what this country has strived for since it adopted as its highest moral value—the pernicious concept of equality.

                Exactly.  Equality belief failed to elevate all to the same level, so now we seek to hammer down those pesky nails (Whites) that stick up.  Of course, the concept of “merit” is diametrically opposed to such a process, hence my original posting.

            The pursuit of mediocrity is the main obsession of our elites. Outsourcing is a good example. Are Chinese manufactured goods on a par with those produced by the now-shuttered American or European factories? Of course not. They are at best poor imitations and often dangerous to those using them. It doesn’t matter. The elites just want something half-assed that looks and functions sort of like the real thing. They get to pocket the money that used to be “wasted” on well paid factory workers. The same thinking is why your company replaced it’s software developers with a bunch of mush mouthed Pajeets that only other Pajeets can understand. This is the “one weird trick” that our elites know and it is their answer toEVERYTHING.

                In my old life, we had a (White) software engineer on staff.  A genius if there ever was one.  His job was to rework student (and faculty) programs written for faculty such that they could be distributed to other researchers in the field.  These programs were written by both Indians and Chinese students, as those were the major races employed in the program.During my many years of interaction with him, we’d discuss such duty occasionally.  When asked wrt the effort involved, he demurred. Stating only that the reprogramming/correction needed was limited.  I inquired for further clarification.  He stated flatly the work was limited because he could sense through experience how bad the work was and then cut losses and simply rewrite the entire program from scratch in a much shorter time than to correct poorly written algorithms and the like.I stand in awe of this man to this date, nor did I ever hear of him putting down anyone whose program he was given.

        These power outages in Houston are a reminder to live where the white folks are. I am sure that the enemies of all that is good, decent and true will allege or have already alleged that the Houston power outage is due to some failure of infrastructure/planning/governance, and blame Republicans. Being statists, they naturally look for top down problems that they think can be fixed with top down solutions.Let’s say for the sake of argument that they are correct in their diagnosis. I submit that even if that is the case, white people still would have found a way to get the power back on. Because that’s what white people do. But Houston is no longer a white city or a white metro area. Houston proper is 47% hispanic, 25% negro, and barely 20% white. Greater Houston is 47% white. Muds being unable to keep the utilities running reliably is not exactly a newsflash.Granted, some major hurricanes, such as Katrina, Ian, or Hugo, are so severe that the power is going to be out for a good while no matter what color the people are. But Beryl, when it made landfall in Texas, was not such a storm. From what I saw of the windspeeds, the power shouldn’t have been out for more than a day or 2, if that.I suspect this is just another example of the real time racial idiocracy decline of AINO that we are witnessing.

        Heritage took a huge, albeit fleeting, severe hit when it went down the DIE Pike with its strong black woman affirmative action hire Kay Coles as director. She was a complete Bushie who embraced all the leftwing pablum albeit in the typical kinder, gentler fashion. On her disastrous way out, as I recall, Coles called her persistent critic Tucker Carlson a racist and misogynist. She apparently didn’t think transphobia applied. Heritage thus became too Con, Inc., for Con, Inc. and the money dried up. The organization then fully jumped on the Trump Train to remain relevant and, of course, able to raise funds.The Borg is hating on Heritage for now putting profits over gatekeeping phoniness. I kind of doubt this is a straight up fraud on the part of Heritage as a result. We often question why the Regime didn’t flatter and co-opt Trump from the get, though, and this might have been a belated acknowledgement that was a missed opportunity, and this was the route to do so. It is indeed shocking Trump refused to take the bait, and sort of interesting.The Regime is beyond repair and reform now in no small part because it did not recognize the disgust Trump’s election represented. That Cole was hired within two years of that watershed moment is Exhibit A for that proposition, and Project 2025 is to be expected from folks that clueless. That doesn’t mean they are not sincere, but it indicates they have forgotten everything and learned nothing, which Con, Inc., and the GAE do regularly.

        We are thinking along similar lines, Z. I did some quick fact finding on this project 2025 that all you eeeeeeevil conservative nazis are supposedly in on.It’s part of a bigger trend I am seeing over on the left. You and the rest of the fellas may have noticed it? It seems that scuttlebutt and traffic over on the left is getting more and more like Gab – but in reverse.The corporations aren’t owned by palm rubbing hook nosed happy merchants – but he red neck hillbillies that are extremely wealthy and extremely stupid at the same time. They only exist to pick on jews, women, vibrants and queers who are innocent and pure as the driven snow. These hateful, awful whites are going to use the three letter agencies to spy on liberals, to beat them up during routine traffic stops, and harass innocent lefties. Did you know the NYT and the rest of the media are in the bag for Trump? It’s true!!!!!1! All they talk about is poor old Joe while they TOTALLY ignore Trump and all his eeeeevil lies and schemes!It’s boggling to watch. And funny as hell to watch them attacking each other. I wonder if we aren’t about to see a lot of New Current Things and Narratives right away…? Their tune is definitely changing… and not for the good either.

        The concept of a Borg queen never arose in the Next Generations series to my knowledge. I think it was early girl boss junk thrown into the later movies. The Borg as leaderless and completely autonomous is more like our real world apparatus today.

            A great deal made about a document heavily redacted and illogical conclusions drawn, or left to be drawn.  I’ve been through this before, and tire of doing it again.  Let’s just view this in a logical manner on a few points:What happens if the President is dead or civilian command structure incapacitated due to first strike?  We are powerless to use nuclear weapons?  Of course not.  The authorization falls to military commanders so designated and appointed in lieu of a recognizable civilian command structure. To not do so is a grave security failing that actually “invites” such attack.If the President authorizes a nuclear weapons strike, what does that mean—the military blows up everything we can reach in the world?  We immediately ask the President whom to strike? Of course not.  The strike will be one that is planned and asked for by the military and therefore has a modicum of reality as fits the current world situation.  Indeed, it will most likely have been decided upon with a joint discussion between the Chiefs of Staff and the President and his advisors.  The President has simply issued an attack plan already decided upon in advance as is his Constitutional power and duty.If the President is a raving lunatic or a demented old man or even believed not to be in mental control, does one think the chain of people such attack plans have to go through would hold up and enforce his football “edict”.  Doubtful.Finally, the issue of first strike/use comes up.  It might be a good thing to do a Putin like restatement of first use.  Here, I may be off, but I’ve yet to hear a US policy restatement warning/outlining of first use in the tactical theater.  Until Obama signed off on a rebuild of our nuke arsenal, tactical theater use nukes were not in vogue and development.  I assume they now are since the MIC is in love with wunderwaffen of all types.Tactical theater use is the greatest “problem” we face, but that is probably the same issue that any President will face in the future, not specifically a Biden Whitehouse thing.FUD sells.

        A quick note about Amanda Milius.  She’s the daughter of John (Dirty Harry, Conan the Barbarian, Red Dawn) Milius.Not sure how she got mixed up with this Project 25 business but she did serve in Trump’s previous administration in the White House and the State Dept. so her thinking she might have a job in his next administration wouldn’t necessarily be a delusional fantasy.She also directed the documentary film, The Plot Against the President, which I’ve heard good things about but haven’t got around to watching.The Astral Flight Simulation podcast has an interesting interview with her for anyone who might be curious.

                Regardless, it’s the most effete-sounding Spanish name in existence. Its English analog would be Dinwiddie.

                    If he hails from Castillian stock (as is likely), many moons ago an ancestor’s comparable name would sound much more impressive, something like:Nicolas Antonio Cristobal de las Fuentes de Santa Ana Maria de los Dolores de Madrid y Torrejon

        My first contact with the term Borg was over at the late Colonel Lang’s blog about ten years ago.  IIRC it was Andrei Martyanov who started using it there.Borg is a lot better than “MICIMATT” but basically means the same thing.  I’m sure ConInc rates “node” status, whatever that means.  I assume they are still using the term.  But maybe not. I checked out after Lang died and the site was taken over by a borg-ist Ukrainiac who was just repeating bullshit from ISW.I’m not a homosexual, so I don’t know if there is more etymology to the term between Colonel Lang and Captain Kirk. But it’s a great concept, however it is applied.
