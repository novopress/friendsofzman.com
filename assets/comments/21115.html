        Seems like a farewell tour for the old sixties radicals. The young woke crowd is standing by with pillows.

            I think we are seeing this all the way around. Those who came of age in the late 60‚Äôs and early 70‚Äôs are now over 65. Late wave boomers and Gen-x will get passed over by the Millennials. The trouble for the Dem is they will suffer from a lack of organizational talent. These woke POC‚Äôs lack the IQ and talent to run much of anything. They exist now as free riders on a system still run by old whites and Jews.

                It happens now. Early Boomers cling to positions of authority until the Millennials force the geezers out of the way. That‚Äôs two malignant generations in charge of everything. Zoomers will have to elbow the Millennials out of the way eventually, too.

                    At the risk of sounding pessimistic, I‚Äôm not optimistic about a world run by millennials. Having had to work around them in the workplace the last 15 years or so, I struggle to see them exercising authority a sober minded manor.

                        Which probably goes a long way in explaining why the positions of authority are still occupied by aging boomers. A more astute generation would have figured out how to depose them long, long ago.

                                Those younger kids ruined their brains with drugs.  The older boomers were almost out of college when drugs became big and were fortunate to grow up in a more ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù era.  Have seen this in my family. Youngest bro‚Äô born in 1954 ‚Äî got lots of goodies, trips, camps that the older ones never dreamed of ‚Äî and is majorly effed-up.

                        It is hard to exercise authority and leadership when someone is more concerned about peer pressure than performance. The Boomers‚Äô self-absorption actually helped them exercise authority. Gen X‚Äôers could fill those roles but will be frozen out by people now in their late Sixties and then passed over for people now in their Thirties.

                            Yeah, that was always obvious in my corporate career. The people ahead of us would die in their jobs. By the time that happened, the younger generation would be ready to take those spots and youth always wins, even if it is stupid. It‚Äôs why I went out on my own.

                                Now that you mention it, at my medium sized company all but a handful of the retired boomer slots were filled with ‚Äúkids‚Äù in their mid twenties.  They seem to do okay I suppose.  A large part of that is logistics, if they spend months training someone who‚Äôs in their early 40s they know they could be looking at having to do it all over again in 10 or so years.

                                Between Gen X and millennials, the millennials are clearly naive followers.   They need to be led.  There‚Äôs zero inclination to buck the system, and this is always good for promotions.  A Gen Xer would work for Satan and know he‚Äôs Satan.  The millennial wouldn‚Äôt have a clue, even if he walked past a pentagram on the floor with lit candles.   Zero critical thinking skills.  Gen Xers are better striking out on their own, when they can.

The idea that critical thinking is ‚Äútaught in college‚Äù rather than an inborn, genetically determined talent brought to fruition in college is another egalitarian lie of our Enemy.

To anyone who reads this and has children: it isn‚Äôt enough for boys to lift weights anymore. You need to put them into a contact sport, preferably boxing or MMA.This is a MUST and will reap untold benefits for their lives. Even football won‚Äôt do the trick as it seems like a monkey game to smart kids.Rugby and wrestling also good options but taking a punch is irreplaceable.

Heck, if I were really smart I‚Äôd have dropped out of undergrad and cleaned up during the dotcom boom.

                        I‚Äôm a late Xer and I walked out on an utterly bizarre late Millennial supervisor around Thanksgiving last year.
I never should have taken that role because this guy had bizarre personal characteristics.
The pompador haircut, problem glasses, forced deep tone of voice, tattoos, working 80+ hour weeks tracking towards burnout, limping around the office because he was physically damaging himself during his bike workouts, intensely criticism of petty things like adjective choice, and a super creepy catchphrase eventually made me realize life is too GD short.

A couple of recommendations that examine the aftermath of importing the Third World into Europe include Douglas Murray‚ÄôsStrange Death of EuropeandClare Ellis‚ÄôThe Blackening of Europe: Ideologies &amp; International Developments.

                        The destruction of education is a key component of destroying civilization. What it all comes down to is that blacks cannot be elevated to the level of civilization. For that reason, civilization must be reduced to savagery. Only in a savage environment can blacks be equal to whites.

                                            Agree. As a boomer I am constantly amazed at the idea that we inherited a white utopia. The silent generation gave us most of the things that people hate about us such as mass immigration and feminism. We, of course, let it get worse just as each following generation has let things deteriorate even more.
But none of that really matters. Most whites have been against the dreadful charges that have taken place but, as we can see with Trump, what we want doesn‚Äôt matter.

                        Yup.  Millenials have felt the leftist boot on their face, or have put on the boot.  Affirmative action in school admissions is a huge red pill for many of us Millenials.  My 1st choice post secondary school had 2 rates of admissions for a male of my qualifications: 2-5% if white, 95-100% if black. Gee, seems like the ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù i hear about was inverted, I wonder what else is wrong with the Narrative.  Then the jobs market where positions and promotions are based on whats between your legs instead of between your ears, and pretty soon you are on this side of the river.A long way of saying, modern culture has pushed more of my generation to the hard right than since the early 1900‚Äôs, but also pulled more to the hard left.  We are more polarized than ever, more than Xers who are more than boomers.

                            It was a faustian bargain for people our age. Lefty took it, righty didn‚Äôt. Lefty riding high for now, until the devil gets his due.
I didn‚Äôt take the bargain. Figured it would be better to struggle in youth and have the chance to succeed in middle age instead of losing all in the reckoning. We‚Äôll see if it was a good bet.

                        ‚ÄúA good portion of young gen is more bitter cause they experienced feminist courts &amp; minorities hurting them in some way or thee other.‚Äù
I‚Äôm a late Gen Xer and I can relate to both. I‚Äôve been burned in family [kangaroo] court and had significant run-ins with a couple of minorities, with one of them being heavily involved in the aforementioned kangaroo court. Bitterness is an understatement in this case; these red-pilled/black-pilled experiences turned me hard right from my former associations in the Civic Nationalist and Paleolibertarian camps.

                Since you bring up Jesus, all I will say is that, like many great men or ideals, how his so-called followers acted is quite different from the Christ described in the Bible.

        It used to be interesting to watch the intra-party squabbles back in the sixties/seventies. Back then, cultural issues were being monopolized by the left wings of both parties, though Nixon managed to scam his way to victory by suggesting Southerners were right to avoid the radical policies of the Democrats. The GOP has been scamming all of us ever since, convention after convention. Covid-19 has mercifully put all this to rest so we can get down to the real issues of ‚Äúwho, whom‚Äù.Tip of the hat to the Trump team who were first to recognize that this would be an epic transformation. By postponing the GOP convention and allowing the Democrats to go first, Trump and his team can analyze the effects of the first work-from-home political convention. They will try not to step into the same turds.

        This is a shell of a convention.  The last go-round of old people doing things they used to do.  Our culture has decided to burn all the things down.  Socializing, sports, politics, living in proximity to each other, even the act of voting.  Justice and commerce have been bastardized, and the basic human relationship of meeting face-to-face, for any reason, has been cancelled.  All of this has been done in the name of TDS and taking down Trump, but it was going to be done anyway.  It is the destruction and atomization of humanity.  Blame whoever you want, but we seem to have reached a point where there is not enough of anything to go around, including such things as humility, empathy, or grace.  Good manners and consideration of others is out.  It‚Äôs all a bust-out now, grab what you can, and may the strongest prevail.  Civilizations and societies go through that phase, now and again.  IMO it comes from looking into the abyss, having no support mechanism or community to fall back on, and simply throwing in the towel and burning everything down, both physically and mentally.  Community standards, jails, and asylums are supposed to be there to keep the bad things in check.  All gone now.  Proceed accordingly.

        Taboos are also being broken. When I was growing up (in the early 60s), a nigger was a bad black person. All races have bad persons in their ranks, and they all had nicknames. But only the ‚ÄúN-word‚Äù became taboo. Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you that lots of people are once again referring to bad blacks as niggers. That is not a trivial cultural change. Let the vapors and fainting begin.

Besides the ethics of it, it sounds like a sharp curse word.  It‚Äôs just so blunt.  The aural equivalent of busting the butt of a rifle into someone‚Äôs nose.  In elementary school it was known not to say it around me or I‚Äôd fight you. One of the first books my mom read to me was a bio on Martin Luther King.  Very moving.  As their struggle was legit at that stage.  Anyway it‚Äôs just a bad word.  We should stop.

                Cracker, white trash, spic, wop, kike (on and on). Yes, if you use these as visceral epithets, all are indeed fighting words. But that‚Äôs not how I learned it. Young children were warned about various dangers that could harm you either acutely or by assimilation into criminal behaviors. And you can‚Äôt give a 5 year old an ethical dissertation on racial epithets when conveying this wisdom. Hence the shorthand version.

                            You‚Äôre assuming that I think nigger is inherently bad. I‚Äôm not saying that.

While they probably won‚Äôt knock on our doors for the crime of dissidence just quite yet, maybe ‚Äúracism‚Äù isn‚Äôt too far off.Also, ‚Äúnigger‚Äô glorifies our enemy. Validates them. I suspect that it doesn‚Äôt bother them at all ‚Äî that many troublesome blacks are just walking around waiting to hear the word ‚Äúnigger,‚Äù even if it‚Äôs only in their minds. I‚Äôd rather not partake in that.

                                    Because ‚Äúnigger‚Äù has become a signifier of fictional historical relevance. It‚Äôs a theatrical word; one that always puts them directly on center stage. Notice how they‚Äôre always crowing about the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of the word.All they have to do is accuse someone of saying it and the whole discussion gets subverted. Not to mention it paints a target on that person‚Äôs back. But again, I agree that, among friends or in very specific contexts, it has its uses.Also, they‚Äôve successfully coopted the word. I really doubt that the word even bothers them, even when white people use it. It‚Äôs become a badge of honor to get called one.

I don‚Äôt even know what that means. Are you in college, by any chance?
All they have to do is accuse someone of saying it and the whole discussion gets subverted.
That only works because people like you imbue the word with magic properties. If it wasn‚Äôt voodoo‚Äôed up by the usual suspects, nobody would care any more than if they were accused of calling someone an asshole.
I really doubt that the word even bothers them, even when white people use it.
Then what‚Äôs the problem?

Why benefit does it confer to say nigger in all but the most private contexts? It‚Äôs not doing our side any favors.

Indeed. By the time King came to Selma, there were no more civil rights issues to be resolved, they‚Äôd all been handled through lawfare by men like Thurgood Marshal ‚Äì a name you don‚Äôt hear the BLM drones mention a whole lot.
That‚Äôs why King had to move on to social justice and that‚Äôs what Selma was about: gibsmedats.

                    I have seen ‚Äî but only rarely ‚Äî the argument made that ‚ÄúThe Negro‚Äù was actually better off under Jim Crow! At the very least, there are probably historical statistics that would bear this out. Merely to compare, say, violent crime rates for Blacks, bastard births, etc. between 1945 and 2020 would be eye-opening. Just read the 1965 Moynihan report and see how badly things have deteriorated.When there was rigid segregation, the Good blacks (Talented Tenth if you like) were bottled up in the same area as the savages. They exerted a civilizing, controlling influence upon the bad actors ‚Äî because they had to. When the laws changed and they got the chance, of course they got the hell out of Dodge. A few Blacks‚Äô lives improved, many Whites were scared and moved to new areas, but the most marginal blacks were left in the old hood which rapidly slid into the mess they‚Äôve been. ‚ÄúCivil Rights‚Äù would be better named ‚ÄúCivil Blights.‚Äù Fellas, both us crackas and you paid a really, really big price just so your black ass could sit anywhere on the bus or at that lunch counter!

        Its the last George McGovern convention of our age complete with hippie music performed by an old hippie and a black man in a dress.But this time unlike 1972 the descendants of the white elite will not become yuppies they instead will become minorities who‚Äôs function is to bow before the brown hordes descending upon western civilization.

                        Heinlein‚Äôs SF novelStarship Troopershas, if I recall correctly, an intersting world. Relevant to this topic, even if you were born in the country, you were merely a ‚ÄúLegal Resident.‚Äù To become a citizen you had to pass certain standards, forget what, probably serving in military. The point was well made: you had to earn your right to be a citizen; it wasn‚Äôt just granted because of where you happened to fall out of Momma‚Äôs twat. His spoof on the military was neat: they would take anyone, and find duty to suit the individual‚Äôs political views. But they had old-fashioned harsh military discipline.

            It only works for the Historic American Nation. The rest don‚Äôt give a shit and have been trying to change it to suit themselves since at least the 1840s.

That said, I think Americans forgot how you won those rights in the first place. The British didnt just give up their colony.

                Wrong.The Constitution is an embodiment of what a bunch of white men thought would be a society in which white men could flourish.Just because it‚Äôs not working out in the current day ‚Äì is not the fault of the document  ‚Äì it‚Äôs the fault of the people of the current day who refuse the honor and ENFORCE the society and government that document was supposed to define.People who make arguments like this are not qualified to be analyzing or leading anything IMHO.They remind me of a person who gets a Corvette and then proceeds to bitch about how the car is a piece of crap and is slower than his bicycle.Take a closer look dummy.  Somebody disconnected the spark plugs and then poured 3000 pounds of lead into the trunk.

                    Horse hockey. Its was written for a vastly English (not Anglo Saxon here, English) Protestant population and no one else.It died with the waves of European immigration and over issues of trade and slavery.Its not that good for Germans who are usually authoritarian , their boot on your neck or yours on theirs.Its document is long  dead and if the DR gets power we are going to have a new Constitution and some kinds of speech, some religions and a whole lot of behaviors like easy divorce smoking dope and possibly porn and abortion  are going to be illegal. It will be regulated society for the 21st century.This means in such a situation people will in fact be less free than they are now which is just fine.If you want order, you  need authority.

                            Lysander Spooner pointed out a long time ago that the Constitution either authorizes exactly the state we have or is utterly powerless against it, and so is at best worthless.
American ideas ranging from normie conservatism to libertarianism are so tempting, because they imagine a sane and peaceful world. But the world rightly insists, every day, that it‚Äôs crazy and it‚Äôs after us.

Problem is the Christians have no men willing to take out the sword and chop some degenerates heads off for violating moral laws.Christianity with a few exceptions is part of the problem now. And I say that as a Christian myself.

            The United States Constitutionwasgreat. Now it is routinely ignored and in many ways like its Soviet counterpart: yes, you have rights on paper, but don‚Äôt think they can be exercised. Courts pull things out of their ass and pretend the decisions have a constitutional basis. It is fantasy paperwork because the constitution depends to a large degree on trust and honor, traits not shared by Third World invaders and the Empire‚Äôs actual rulers who laugh at such pretensions. The constitution will continue to shrivel as a relevant document as the nation becomes browner and the police state expands.

                The 1787 Constitution had a great run, by historic standards.  For a founding document to remain workable for 2+ Centuries is quite astounding.
That being said, it‚Äôs a dead letter here in year 233.

                    The Constitution died at the Hartford Convention. That‚Äôs when the New England states decided they could no longer tolerate the arrangement. A couple of generations trying to make it work gave us the Civil War and the ‚Äúsecond founding.‚Äù

                        Some argue the Constitution was a dead letter even before the Hartford Convention and was killed by Marbury, which effectively vested all real power with the United States Supreme Court. It is a pretty compelling claim when you watch the arbitrary nature of even lower courts. Kritarchy was a long time coming.Even after the ‚ÄúSecond Founding,‚Äù which ultimately did render the Constitution a dead letter, there was some adherence to the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers. The Constitution undeniably became a totally empty governing document with the Brown decision and was shot in the head just in case with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Both ended any semblance of freedom of association and rendered basic liberty null and void.The United States has been unstable a very long time because of the strange and unwarranted fealty to judicial fiat. America was a failed state even before it became an Empire, which filled the void after Appomattox.

                            Marbury v Madison destroyed the United States in the cradle. When a judge can overrule the congress, the people effectively have no redress against the government except through authoritarian populism or rebellion.The U.S. was successful because of the stock of it‚Äôs people and their culture.It‚Äôs been a long slow burn since then.  Greater abuses of authority beget further abuses.  Compound that with massive immigration, subversion of the culture, and a uniparty system‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs amazing we did so well for so long on our momentum.I have no doubt in my lifetime I will see a judge declare some or all of the bill of rights unconstitutional despite being the actual constitution.

The Pinochet stuff is a 7 years ago tier meme.So who knows, maybe we met at an old amren and maybe the name stuck and you remember me.For reasons I have had to back away.  I only recently started posting here because I wanted to reach out to Z, mainly because I believe in his work and I felt it important, I dont even talk to trs people anymore or ID folks because after the facebook shutdown I have lost all contact with my old friends.  Even the local pool party I used to run I had to hand off.I know what I said, but I dont advocate a Pinochet(CIA funded) revolution.  I advocate for a legal response first, everything else is so unpredictable its not worth worrying too much about.Thanks again for the backup, but I‚Äôm just a regular guy who wants to say something.

                            I tried to understand Marbury/Judicial Review (restraint?) and got confused. As I understood it, it meant that (back then at least) the Court basically said that we agree you have a case, but Congress said otherwise, and we won‚Äôt do anything about it. Yet much later, it seems the Court‚Äôs decisions are all and what the Legislature meant bedamned.

                                The terms of the case aren‚Äôt necessarily as important as the precedent the case established.Chief Justice John Marshall struck down a law because he deemed it ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù.It‚Äôs essentially a get out of jail free card.  If the supreme court decides it doesn‚Äôt like a law it says it‚Äôs not constitutional and *poof* the law doesn‚Äôt count anymore, and noone can do anything about it unless the supreme court takes the case again and changes it‚Äôs mind.This is how we got desegregation, gay marriage, abortion and all manner of insidious ‚Äújudgements‚Äù.It‚Äôs a complete miscarriage of justice and frankly evil.  Every law on the books is subject to judicial review and the capriciousness of those on the bench.  Your votes don‚Äôt matter.And that‚Äôs why the legislature doesn‚Äôt put forth anything useful anymore anyways.If America was ever to for example‚Ä¶  gain freedom of association again, it would either have to pack the court with friendly judges and take a case to reverse it‚Ä¶ Or the arduous process of adding an amendment to the constitution.

                                    Your explanation seems clear. I think I have judicial restraint confused with review. To use your final example, couldn‚Äôt Congress (for example) repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964? Sure, but that would be even more unlikely than the Supremes striking it down üôÅI just re-read the Wiki page and‚Ä¶so the Supremes can ‚Äústrike down‚Äù (judicial review) Congress‚Äôs laws. This part I can understand. Congress make bad law, Court say ‚Äúuh-uh.‚ÄùI guess I‚Äôd need a much more detailed explanation of how this same doctrine allows the Supremes to pull new ‚Äúrights‚Äù out of their Judicial rectums, but apparently that is precisely what they do, some of the more controversial ones you mention.At least bakeries can still refuse to bake a cake for gay people.

                        Regarding the Hartford Convention, I suspect that we may be heading for a test of the Compact Theory in the next 100 years or so ‚Äì maybe sooner.
The country is growing more and more diverse and that diversity is concentrated in regions with the Southwest heavily Hispanic, NE and other parts heavily White, etc. At some point, the laws coming out of a Washington with no cultural or ethnic ties to various regions will be ignored.

                            It is happening now. Sanctuary cities for illegals, sanctuary cities for gun owners. Of course, since the Marxist Left is ascendant there will be attempts to have that only work one way, but it is out of their hands ultimately. Look for state-sanctioned disruption of residential and commercial electrical and water services to continue to be a routine feature of American life, and the State‚Äôs anger to boil over as people work around it. California does it now. Soon other governments will follow. Virginia started to do it to counties that were to become 1st Amendment sanctuaries but realized its strongholds in Fairfax and Richmond are highly vulnerable to attacks on their power and water sources.I write this a lot but people need to brace for it. Once the Left really consolidates power it will launch a False Flag terrorist attack on a Red area in an attempt to get Whites to rally ‚Äôround the flag. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Criticize and ostracize any family member or friend who joins the military or has children to do so. Make sure your friends, family and neighbors realize the attack came from D.C.Another thing I mentionad nauseumis that the first dissolutions will be intrastate and not from the national governmentper se.They won‚Äôt be recognized but they will be de facto states.D.C. will be a paper tiger internally long before people around the world realize it is a paper tiger internationally.Again, this is coming fast. Federal laws will be mere suggestions in the near future.

                                A smidge optimistic.  States could figure out how to live without the Feds but for Medicaid.  Even for SS and Medicare they could probably figure something out, but Medicaid is pure printed graft on the back of a legacy reserve currency.  The pain on a state would have to be quite extreme before that level of sacrifice was contemplated.

                        Jefferson was of the opinion that governments needed to be kept honest by the occasional pitchfork and torch procession ‚Äî hence his notorious quote about the tree of liberty ‚Äî and that the governmental compact needed to be reviewed/replaced every couple decades.  Of course he was President on the occasion of the Constitution‚Äôs 20th birthday and nothing came of it.  Also, I shudder to think what today‚Äôs political class would come up with in terms of a constitution.

                            We may live long enough to shudder. It‚Äôs called an Article V Convention. But that probably won‚Äôt be necessary. I side with those who point out that laws, including that amusing piece of parchment, are increasingly just set pieces, to not be taken too seriously. So what need to rewrite a document nobody is going to follow anyway?

                    I think where it really went wrong was the 14th and 19th amendments.  Allowing people with no skin in the game a vote was always the problem.  Future societies hopefully learn that wide spread democracy/ one person one vote eats itself.

            The Constitution *is* a great document, if you were reading it in 1800.  However the Constitution of today is but a document replica framed upon the wall in a SCOTUS office, while in the bookcase below are a dozen volumes of hundreds of pages each of historical ‚Äúinterpretations‚Äù which now form the working body of that long dead Constitution framed enshrined above.In there lies the problem.  The rubes/normies are shown the framed version when they seek reassurance, TPTB use the interpretive body when they seek to rule over us.  Took them 200 years to pervert such a framework as the Founders initially gave us, but they‚Äôre a patient bunch.  May we have the same patience.

            Glen‚Ä¶the electoral college and constitution were good once upon a time. Too late for them. The great demographic replacement is tossing both out. Reality. No stopping the browning of America. The foundational argument from now until a black swan event changes the cards on the table is Demographics underpinning all. And demographic reality is tribalism‚Ä¶you name the group and they‚Äôre triballed up for a piece of the pie and protecting their own. Pathologically altruistic whites don‚Äôt tribal and won‚Äôt get it until death constantly stalks us. And most won‚Äôt get it. The founding concepts you wish we would protect are gone with the wind.Time to kraal up in small communities if you wish to stay alive and maintain some degree of sanity. Planning what comes next will gradually arise as we see the cards played. There are more shoes yet to drop.

            I tend to agree.  That whole Constitution thing started to go off the rails relatively early though, specifically when Justice John Marshall seized excessive court power inMarbury v Madison.  There remain gems of exceptional insight in the Constitution, some of which we still follow.  But the forces are already aligned against the electoral college ‚Ä¶ I expect it to go away in short order.  I think Z-man‚Äôs quote is based on the fact that our salvation won‚Äôt be found in a moth-eaten document that‚Äôs riddled with 200 years of Supreme Court malfeasance ‚Ä¶ along with a disunited people, half of whom are on the take.My hope for the future is partition, and hopefully whites can rebuild on something similar to the present Constitution, sansMarbury v Madisonand all of the Amendments since 1913.  Not sure where we‚Äôd send our progressive whites ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking Haiti.

        Did you know that John Kasich is the humble son of a mailman that never forgot his midwestern values?

Because his consulting expertise was invaluable to the operations of the firm.  Who else knows synthetic derivatives cold like the son of a mailman?

                                        You know, abp, I think we do have a clear ideology. In fact, it may be a bit TOO clear. I think our problem is that the vast majority of us are afraid to go out on a limb and try to start a movement that could easily get us de-personed. I also think few if any of us have done the hard work of putting a plan of action together. We know what needs to be done, but few know confidently how to do it.

                                            But what if you being in the arena serves the interests of the enemy? What if you being in the arena harms the cause you claim to represent? The assumption that simply being in the arena is a good in of itself is a conceit shared by every narcissistic attention whore. Sargon and Richard Spencer are ‚Äúin the arena‚Äù and no sane person would say that‚Äôs good for our side.

There are solutions posited here all the time if you take the time to read between the lines. Most involve subterfuge and positioning which is -exactly- what needs to be happening at this stage of things.Pro Tip: They don‚Äôt involve a head on confrontation ‚Äúin the arena‚Äù with the gov‚Äôt backed lefty mob.If however, you‚Äôd like to test your theory, go pick a fight in the street w/ Antifa and once you are out on bail report back here with a list of your charges. I‚Äôd like to compare it to the ones I got and see who wins‚Ä¶

                                                                I‚Äôd like to say that I wish them the best.If it offers them legal protections, I‚Äôm happy for that.If it causes the left to shriek about a pro-white platform, I‚Äôm happy.If it causes a national conversation and gets curious people to start looking for alternative media, I‚Äôm happy.If it makes people re-consider what ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù political discourse is, and what they can talk about or demand, that‚Äôs a win.If it means that republicans get pulled rightward trying to prevent voters defecting, I‚Äôm happy.If it forces the government and media to take off the mask and show the common people what *really* happens to dissidents and how they‚Äôre repressed‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs progress.If it forces the government to have to play by their own rules or show their hypocrisy, I‚Äôm happy.If it gets even some electoral success, even if only on a local level‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy for that.If it raises funds that will get put back into causes on our side of the divide, that‚Äôs phenomenal.They have a large reach, and I think if they play their cards right that there could be massive opportunities for pro white politics. Things are dire.. but it‚Äôs precisely because they are dire that people are going to be receptive to messages they wouldn‚Äôt have given a second thought even 6 months ago.  Remember during Ferguson when every mid-brow right winger sounded like a full on fascist?They‚Äôre quiet now not because they agree‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre scared.  They know it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúfree country‚Äù for them anymore.  And they are absolutely *seething*. I can‚Äôt think of a better time to start a pro-white party.Someone has to do it, maybe they‚Äôll be successful, maybe another party will. I do think there needs to be a political party of some sort though. It won‚Äôt be easy. Even if some of your listeners or you yourself don‚Äôt like them, I think it‚Äôs at least worth offering moral support and hope for their success.  I know that feathers get rustled between dissident people sometimes, but I closely follow both you and their work.  And I‚Äôm glad that you do such a great job critiquing with class.  It offers a lot of perspective and frankly keeps me on an even keel.We need to use everything possible in our arsenal. Political parties, legal redress, blogs, community building, evangelism, clubs, small businesses, homeschooling. We all have our roles to play and our strengths to cater to.  I‚Äôve never been of the opinion that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright way‚Äù to do things.  Just that we have to try every avenue and see what works.  A cultural revolution at every level for the soul of our people.P.S.  lots of age chauvinism around here today.Give the old guys a break, they‚Äôre cranky and have had to deal with this shit a long time.Take it easy on the kids, They may not have had the luxury of having a dad around.I‚Äôm so tired of the age-war shit.

To be able to operate from cover, perhaps even inside the enemy lines, must not be discounted. This is especially a good option for those who must keep a respectable front for career, social or other reasons. Depending upon what you have planned of course, weigh the risks, because if the enemy finds you out they will be merciless. Finally, this is an appealing option to those who ‚Äî not without reason ‚Äî fear the risks of joining any type of organization.

This is exactly it.
We have yet to reach a critical mass of people who realize that our people do have a collective identity and collective interests.
This is why the people who think we should focus on local efforts in our communities are also correct.
Grassroots is the only way in short term.

                                                        Lots of patriots in small towns like Klamath , Colorado City and Fort Collins  have already done that. Run Antifa out of town on a rail.A guy in Austin legally shot one dead.Its just gets little coverage.Thing  is its strictly defense and our side and related sides don‚Äôt have a reason or means to take offensive action in scale. Yet.This leave Antifa to act at leisure in Blue cities which have sympathetic leaders.This is destructive but our side in many ways would be happy to be rid of larger cities entirely and as we want nothing to do with Lagos or NYC for that matter , aren‚Äôt willing to fight in enemy territory and prefer to let our foes wreck the area.Its dyscivic to say the least but that‚Äôs what happens when societies start to fail.Nothing much to be done for it either other than protect what we own and maybe expand a bit.

                                                I have to agree with you on that note. I‚Äôll give an example; Back in ‚Äô07 I was getting coffee at a local joint and there was a Marine Major on line with me. He struck up a conversation with me about the current state of affairs (I‚Äôm former Army) with the service and he made mention of the fact that they can‚Äôt get the new kids to do anything and he also makes mention of the fact that he can‚Äôt get any of them to pass a background check to qualify for any meaningful security clearance. I laugh because I had a secret level clearance and I told him about all of the hoops I had to jump through to get it. Big mistake on my part because now he tries getting me to enlist. I was 39 at the time and tell him so and he gives me the ‚ÄúYour country needs you.‚Äù song and dance, which I politely dismiss. After telling him that Jarheads do not take prior service and him telling me matter of factly that, yes, I would have to go through basic training again, I tell him that I‚Äôm not sympathetic because everything that is happening now is a direct result of this country‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership‚Äù making shitty decision after shitty decision in the foreign policy arena, as well as many other areas- including turning the next generation into a collection of whining, pampered sissies. I explained to him that I did my bit for king and country and it didn‚Äôt make one bit of difference, why should I ‚Äì at this point in my life ‚Äì drop everything to bail out someone else‚Äôs problem? He again tried appealing to my status as a veteran and I then threw salt in the wound by telling him that I have three friends who‚Äôs kids I have talked out of joining the service in the last year, which infuriated him. When he asked why, I asked him if he would send his kid into the meat grinder in Fallujah, or the Kandahar province? Or would his kids future be better served by going down to DC with around 5 million, or so other disaffected, pissed off Americans and rid the country of our ‚Äúbetters‚Äù by dragging them out of their offices and tar and feathering them. He looked dumbfounded and didn‚Äôt know what to say. I respectfully told him that no parent of European descent who cares about their family should ever willingly sacrifice their children to a government that despises them. ‚ÄúThe beast must be starved.‚Äù I told him. And with that, he collected his coffee and left. The woman behind the counter looked at me for a second and said, ‚ÄúI never thought about it that way before and you‚Äôre right. It seems that the only time that politicians speak of us whites in favorable terms is when they‚Äôre placing a flag over the coffins of our children. Thank you for putting that into words for me.‚ÄùIf nothing else, a seed was planted in the ear of someone open to a new idea.

                                                    I used to frequently fly into the Columbia SC airport for business trips. Often, there were several army inductees headed to Fort Jackson. They looked like kids from the audio visual club. I could probably do better in basic training than most of them and I was in my late 50s at the time. I couldn‚Äôt imagine trusting my life to these boys and girls. If ever I had a chance to sit with them on the plane, I would have tried to talk them into not serving. Unfortunately, they were kept together and away from the civilians.

                                                    Well said. I‚Äôm a peacetime vet and I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed (or impressive, to be honest!) in the 1980s. Whatever its ideological failings, the military today has a hell of a time finding qualified people.In the first place, the vast majority of young people have no interest in the services, so part of your wish came true.Google ‚Äútoo stupid for military‚Äù and you get about 84 million hits üôÅIn sum: of the prime recruiting herd (18-26), about 70% don‚Äôt meet basic critera. About 50% too fat/health issues, 20% too stupid, and 10% too criminal (usually drugs). Link:https://observer.com/2018/08/pentagon-most-americans-are-too-fat-stupid-to-enlist-in-the-military/Your comment on Secret is interesting. In the 1980s, I was told the only requirement to meet it was that you be a U.S. Citizen and not a convicted felon. You‚Äôd think most recruits would meet that standard!

                                                    Excellent story.  And exactly the point I‚Äôve tried to make here a number of times:  when you‚Äôre arguing out your position with somebody ‚Äì in the context of making progress you‚Äôre not necessarily trying to convince that person ‚Äì you‚Äôre trying to convince the people who are listening in on the argument.
This works both in person ‚Äì and in the internet space on forums and social media.  There‚Äôs an awful lot of people who just read ‚Äì and never comment or post.

We don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt do to America at its core being Leftist, we‚Äôll than we are better off making small resistant communities and kissing the USA goodbye.

                I hope I may insert an anecdote that everyone except Sentry is bound to like. In the 1980s, my paents and I were legal residents of a rural[insert spittoon sound effect]county in VA. In one Presidential election, the entire county recorded exactly three votes for LaRouche. My family was traditionally Republican but that year we did a protest vote. üôÇ I can‚Äôt remember which election, but the Republican choice must‚Äôve been really bad if my ‚ÄúGreatest Generation‚Äù parents wouldn‚Äôt vote for him.

                    If it was the 80s then my guess for GOP pantywaist would be Bush the Elder in 1988.  He was sold as a great hero ‚Äì WW2 aviator, Reagan VP, etc ‚Äì but he was establishment globalist through and through.  Your folks probably saw through the facade.  It was 4 years later that many of my age bracket went for Ross Perot.

                ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre entering a nomadic phase‚Äù

This is accurate, something to be worked with.
I‚Äôm going to think deeply on this.

The startling fact of modernity is mobility- we‚Äôve never had such mobility, and our assailants have it too.

Maybe our deep instincts- millions of years as hunter/gatherers- will aid us in our strange new world.

        Our leaders are revulsed by the idea that someday ‚Äî for many of them, someday soon ‚Äî they‚Äôre all going to be dead, and that their corny nostalgia revolution will die with them. It absolutely incenses them. Can‚Äôt there be a death filibuster?I expect their neuroticism to worsen as they enter their 70s and 80s. Pretty soon, we‚Äôre all going to be sucking on fluoride-augmented respirators so young Pelosi‚Äôs life isn‚Äôt tragically cut short.The other day, I went to visit an elderly family member in their assisted living facility. No touching; can‚Äôt hold his great-grandson. They even have spies stationed in the lobby who will yell ‚ÄúSIX FEET! SIX FEET!‚Äù if you even try to pass a water bottle. Anyway, I sent an email to the care manager the other day that posed the following question: If the average stay at an assisted living facility is about one year, and it takes two years to create a ‚Äúvaccine,‚Äù is it safe to say that most of your residents will never be able to touch their loved ones again? Of course, no response.How much longer will strangers have total dominion over the lives of our elderly? Now, there is no functional difference between an elderly patient at a nursing home and a prisoner. Where are their rights?

            I don‚Äôt really understand the excitement over this speech.It is just a guy blowing off steam making threats that he has no ability to deliver on.As I said on Gab, what is he going to do, storm the city hall and hang the mayor?i am not sure why people are so fascinated with this video.

        One thing that strikes me in viewing the current political shenanigans outlined by the Zeeman is this: the American imperium is going down the same path as previous polities that dominated their world. Once the creative minority that leads a society becomes a dominant minority that lords over the society, the stage is set for decline. Ethnic and social divisions become toxic political division and violent disorder becomes the norm. A civil war may precede it but some sort of authoritarian government is inevitable to prevent further disorder and slow down the decline.  In Western Civilization, the likely authoritarian government will be a bureaucracy like the deep state but a Caesar is also possibleThe woke crowd are the barbarians seeking the destruction of all that was good in our society.  Lacking numbers, they seek to import the refugees of failed societies to inflict that failure on our own and speed up the decline. The woke crowd anxiously awaits the Apocalypse, not knowing that they will be it‚Äôs first casualties.In the face of long decline there will be a need for people who can develop independent institutions that preserve the knowledge of how to live bette  I hopethat those of us on this side of the great divide will recognize our own self interest in preserving the best for when it be used again by our decendents.  Hang on, it‚Äôs going to be a rough ride.For reference, read Arnold Toynbee‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Study of History‚Äù

For many years, Shark Week was something I looked forward to each Fall, but the quality of the programming went in the toilet a while back. The only reason I knew it was on last week was I could see a big shark on the 70in screen through the neighbors window when out walking my dog.

        I like the comment about the social proof live audiences provide to sports.

Out of morbid curiosity, I watched 2 minutes of an ESPN broadcast of two NBA players playing NBA2K20 online against each other.

I thought it looked and sounded like any two other basement-dwellers playing video games and changed the channel.

            Sportsball ratings are way down, but (and I‚Äôm not as hostile to sports as many on this thread) l‚Äòm guessing it has more to do with the weirdness of it all- hockey in August- two rinks, no fans? A baseball season which has the feel of extended spring training. Don‚Äô give a rat‚Äôs ass about football and basketball. And the swooning every time a player tests positive for Corona-chan. There was a story In my local rag about Aroldis Chapman, who is now ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù from Covid- although he just tested positive- he wasn‚Äôt sick‚Ä¶ If we ever get back to normal, with sports, with spectators and proper seasons In their proper time many of the fans will return. It wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing if the scale of sportsball was reduced.

                I have not followed it closely, but I don‚Äôt believe a single baseball player who has tested positive for Covid was sick enough that he would have missed a game due to illness under normal circumstances.  No one has even come close to needing to be hospitalized.

        Late wave boomer here (1960).  I‚Äôve enjoyed the spectacle of live conventions.  Although increasingly staged, the big crowd, state signs, and speeches are appealing to me.  Last night the wife left the TV on and I noticed the ‚Äúvirtual convention‚Äù was on.  Why?  Who was the target audience?  Boomers older than me?  Before turning it off, it reminded me of the worst video conferences I‚Äôve had to sit through.  Abhorrently bad production.

        The turgid, awful rendition of ‚ÄúFor What It‚Äôs Worth‚Äù at the DNC Convention tells the world that the same people who hoisted the Viet Kong flag in Chicago in 1968 are now ensconced in every seat of power, and in the party of real power, as the elderly statesmen of the original social revolution in 1968.  The Democrats inside the convention hall in 1968 would have been listening to Sinatra.  This year is the completion of their social masterpiece.  The finishing touches were done over the last 20 years.  And usually when political masterpieces are complete, they‚Äôre quickly burned down, as has happened throughout human history.  What the establishment is telegraphing is, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to burn it all down.‚Äù

            What is most striking to me is the infernal corniness of our enemy. These are people of vaginal banality, totally incapable of nuanced thought, endlessly reprising their roles as ‚Äúfigureheads‚Äù in our country. Were they not disgusting people, it would be pitiful.
What comforts me more than anything, though, is that these are people who are revulsed by the inevitability of their own deaths. How *dare* nature not give them a say! Doesn‚Äôt death know who they are? That angst is the nucleus of all their bluster and activism.

            When you look back at 1968 you are conflating two different groups of people. In 1968, when white kids rebelled against the country, they were rebelling against their parents. Conversely, when j3wish kids rebelled against the country, they were carrying on the work of their parents. Until you make this distinction, you are blind.
Why did the white kids rebel against their parents? Because they were the first generation raised by a media/academy controlled by j3ws.

Intersting points on our current riots:https://www.unz.com/freed/its-gonna-blow-be-a-miracle-if-it-dont/?showcomments#comment-4109459(1) Some of the worst rioting in Seattle. &lt;1% Black population. Portland not much more. Much, maybe the majority (?) of the Antifa/BLM is young white radicals.(2) Detroit, ‚ÄúBlackest city in America‚Äù has had zero Antifa or BLM activity (unverified).

                    We have more than just one problem
Most whites who support BLM have had their innate gullibility and compassion hijacked by the media and academia. This tradegy is reversible once our enemies don‚Äôt control the media and academia.
Part of our job is to correct for the fVcking stupidity of a significant minority of white people through restriction of the franchise and some state control on the media and academia.

                    Civilizations are ancient, but machines only last so long.  This one was constructed between 1930 and 1936 and modified and expanded during WW2 and subsequently for the consumerist boom of the 50s and 60s.  It may have Windows and the internet, but it‚Äôs the same old machine.

I had the dream that  the fuzz would bring out riot shotguns but then it hit me ‚Äî would they kill some of the young in my family?

            Just to say again that Vdare article on the mouse utopia was one of the most depressing things I‚Äôd read; to think that future-man may not even have it in him to put together a third-world level society.

        The video featuring Stephen Stills and Billy Porter had more than a taste of surrealism.First, although ‚ÄúFor What It‚Äôs Worth‚Äù must have been calculated to stir the bile of BLM / Antifa true believers, the lyrics have always struck me as ambiguous and even noncommittal ‚Äî a paean to rebellion without content. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something happening here / But what it is ain‚Äôt exactly clear‚Äù? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs battle lines being drawn / But nobody‚Äôs right if everybody‚Äôs wrong‚Äù? Doesn‚Äôt sound appropriate for a convention endlessly pushing the message thatthey‚Äôreright andeverybody elseis racist.And Billy Porter (I‚Äôd never heard of him before) trying to make the song edgy, whirling around in a black cape, like the Devil dropping by to whisk away souls. His MTV-style choreographed moves make him look like a man working the machines in a gym.Stills looking elderly, wearing eyeglasses, a shadow of himself. He can play that git-tar but with the demeanor here of a trained seal, in his 1,680th performance of his composition. All so he can feel Relevant, one more time, for three minutes.

            ‚ÄúStop, children. What‚Äôs that sound?‚Äù
Would they ever tell their children to stop and really take a good look at what‚Äôs goin‚Äô down? I think the irony is lost on them.
