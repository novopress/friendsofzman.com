        I find the whole thing boring.I don’t watch football on TV because it’s nothing but a few minutes of game-play sprinkled over endless chatter by the the sports reporters. (Mind you, I don’t mind that others like it. We all choose our own entertainment.)I don’t go to games because they are way overpriced.

        Pro football’s big problem is that it has evolved from a rough “everyman” game in which the shared vulnerability to injury tempered the violence a bit (similar to rugby), to a game where players are, to a point, well protected by the advanced equipment and certain rules of play.  What that means is that the players are able to play in a very dangerous and dramatic fashion, but now they are prone to “peacock” over their accomplishments, with end zone dances and ritualized motions and signals after a play.  It all looks a bit like gang signs.Add free agency and football video games to the mix, and each player becomes a “brand”, in which the post-play antics become part of the brand.  Some teams, such as the Raiders, have established a distinct brand as well.The “Tom Brady” brand seems to be taking a bit of a beating lately.I am not so sure football is suffering from a racial issue as a cultural one, and I would point out that one of the earliest and most prominent player “brands” was Broadway Joe Namath, a white guy out of the Old South.Watching pro football is no longer a way that I spend a Sunday afternoon.  If the Chargers leave town, so be it.  Watching grown men act like gang members after a big play is not really something I want to be a part of.

            I enjoy watching sports, but the NFL has become less interesting to me of late. Too much preaching of the gospel from the announcers. Too much other stuff intended to hype the game. At a game, the music from the sound system is relentless. It’s all too much.
I’ve thought for a long time now that the NFL is headed for a bad end.

Namath came from a Steel Town on the Ohio River North of Pittsburgh: Beaver Falls. He was a phenomenal athlete excelling in Baseball, Basketball and Football. I had relatives in Beaver Falls and heard all about him at the time.

        Your analysis on the racial issue seem right.  Have a hard time feeling any sympathy for a team that is known for cheating and a quarter back who is a gifted athlete, handsome, wealthy, married to a super model, many times over a champion but still feels the need to cheat.

        […] At the same time, Michelle Obama says it is impossible for black people to escape their blackness. After all, if the Obama family is “knocked back” by racism, despite ascending to the heights of society, it is reasonable to think all black people are consumed with this issue. The woman is middle-aged and still obsesses over it, despite living like royalty so I guess she has a point. Black people can’t see past race. Here….. […]
