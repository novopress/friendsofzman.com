        It’s one of those days where I don’t even want to punch the clock and world anymore. Worlding is too damn depressing.The Zman’s words are common sense, exactly right, and thisclose to being illegal in this backwards age. Why hordes of otherwise sensible people start frothing at the mouth when hearing them baffles me. Troubles me. Is it suicidal guilt? Is it merely social signaling? Or am I in an alternate reality, some bizarro world?I hope that tomorrow, it feels better again.

        Deportation of the terrorist-to-be, his entire immediate AND  ENTIRE EXTENDED FAMILY ( parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, etc)  to the nation from where their parents were born should be immediately implemented.Several terrorist training camps have ALREADY BEEN FOUND  in tne USA. Everybody and anybody  – INCLUDING THEIR IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED FAMILIES – associated with that camp should be IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED.If a terrorist is successful in his act of terror, the ENTIRE IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED FAMILY should be immediately deported.Only when the ENTIRE muslim arab and muslim pakistani population of the USA realizes that they too will be at risk and pay a price when one or several of their fellow ethnic/religious members is involved in nefarious activities, will they begin to self police the activities of their “tribe” or begin reporting to the FBI potential terrorists.As for the radical imams, they, their ENTIRE IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED FAMILIES, as well as the ATTENDEES  of his sermons, and the ENTIRE FAMILIESof the ATTENDEES should be immediately deported.Yes, this is very extreme and a very lousy policy, but there are NO OTHER OPTIONS. There are NO GOOD solutions; just choices amongst bad solutions.

            When you look at it dispassionately, the solution is obvious. End all immigration from Muslim countries. End most of the visa programs. Deport all Muslims who have come here in the last 25 years, regardless of their status. Close down the mosques and ban the public practice of Islam. The temptation is to claim it will require a constitutional amendment, but we got abortion and queer marriage without an amendment.Therein lies the problem. The people blocking these commonsense reforms are the people perverting every other aspect of American life for the sole purpose of pulling the roof down on all of us. Stem one in any reform effort is first get rid of the Cult of Modern Liberalism. Then we can address the Cult of Islam.

                It could be banned on the same legal basis the NSDAP (Nazi party) was and still is banned in Germany, as in it endangers the basic free and democratic order of society. It would also make muslims think twice before migrating west if the asylum process required the conversion to some flavor of Christianity, as a pure practical measure but also a gesture of good faith. Because let’s face it, someone who doesn’t like bacon will never become a productive member of society, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise!

                I would go so far as to say the only muslims allowed in the west should be either diplomatic staff (and reduced embassy staffing at that; they have no need I would imagine for cultural or military attaches), the occasional muslim visitor (under continual surveillance) and the odd muslim professor on a very short contract who would at the end of the contract be escorted on to a plane bound for his (or her, but unlikely) home country.There might be an exception for doctors working in hospitals in the west, but as muslims have often proven themselves untrustworthy it would be unwise to put a westerner’s life, no matter how ill, in their hands.Of course, the muslims would retaliate by saying we shouldn’t be allowed to buy their oil. Well, they can save it up and bathe in it. The west, with its ability to create and engineer, ought to be able to come up with a viable alternative to arab oil.Finally, good border controls to make sure none of this nonsense ever happens again.

            We can’t shut down their training sites, like the 1000 acre + one located in New Bovina, NY, because the FBI is protecting and facilitating the problem! Until law enforcement begins to take their oath seriously, and boot any management to the contrary, repair can not begin!

        One of the first things that a new order will do, whether wretched muslim or probably the very-non-muslim replacements, will be to crack down on the media. Right now we have supine leaders and lick-spittle minions who do nothing but exist in a bubble where they talk among themselves alone, and read and watch left-leaning media outputs. All of this means their view of reality is deeply skewed.Muslims will not in any shape or form tolerate a “free press” and if the right rises up it will be all too aware of the incredible damage a leftist media has done. If we are in a war situation, the media is censored and controlled. That unholy alliance of islam and the left are pushing us to be in a war which, when it is done, will have far less of them around Europe. It is almost like a death wish, some would say.Without the unthinking support of an ignorant and biased leftist media, the world changes. There will still be divisions of opinion, but no longer divisions fostered by people with strange, misplaced agendas. Any group like Communist Gays For Islam will, for example, find it hard to gain traction.I have to say here that I actually left an increasingly muslim dominated area because I didn’t like what was happening. I left for a quieter place where hopefully no one is going to build a mosque in the foreseeable future. If we retreat, the way Europe used to be, into armed strongholds (maybe with walls, who knows?) then while we may give up large chunks of the old cities to muslim invaders the rest of us should be safe enough to live.I seriously think this is the best option, failing a complete change of government (and I do not mean either the hard left and the soft left, as we have in the UK) and until then we will have to keep backing off. The EU is a increasingly a lunatic organisation devoted to establishing Germany as the top dog (curious how it was the French at first, to safeguard their farming) and no one can work out why they are so keen to bring about their own end: the EU will certainly not exist if the muslim invasion succeeds.So to go back to my original point: it is the so-called ‘freedom of the press’ that is reaching an end. If they can’t be intelligent and open-minded and report what is really happening, they are only hastening their demise. Being nicy-nice to the muslims hasn’t worked so far and won’t work in the future, though they won’t be around to report that.

        It’s been a weird couple of days for me. I have this incredible disconnect in my head. I read blogs like this- and the other ones that most of us here do, and what we talk about just seems so obvious to me- of course it’s a terrible idea to invite large numbers of Syrians into the country; of course Islam is not the religion of peace; of course the students that are making a ruckus are spoiled children… etc, etc. Then i go to my Facebook page and see the most amazing kinds of idiocy- we should let in the the Syrians because people didn’t like the Irish back in the 1860’s, that no terrorists are coming into the country, that I can be a woman by just saying I am; that Barack Obama is the greatest man since FDR… on and on.  What puzzles me is that most of these posters are really smart people- members of the cognitive elite, yet they believe things that, to my way of thinking are just nuts. I don’t believe the average Moonbat wants to ruin the country, but they believe things that are guaranteed to do so. What gives?

            You have my sympathy. I have family and friends who talk just like that. Oh you think these atrocities are bad but the crusades were worse, BHO is the greatest and really cares, vote Labour (or for some equally dumb socialist) and all will be well, please come here refugees even though we don’t have jobs (but hey, I bet you are all brain surgeons, right?) and above all, I don’t want to see what reality is because I love my fluffy soft environment where everyone just gets along so well.I have relatives who go on marches to shout “no to racism” even if the march is ostensibly about something else. Cuts in welfare? Bring out the racist chants. Nuclear options? That’s racism. Some scared people not liking those who want to see them dead or enslaved? Hey, I hate you racists even though I obviously love everyone!So I am on the fringe. Fascist, I have been called, or a bigot, because I say things like, ‘do you know what people are like, or what history has demonstrated?’ or ‘have you thought these ideas through?’ Even if I say, ‘you do realise that National Socialism contains the word Socialism and Hitler hated capitalism?’ I get shouted down, being told what they had wasn’t really Socialism because all true socialists are peaceful and love life just as the religion of peace is fabulous.I despair, but then the world went mad a long time ago and fecesbook merely confirms it.

            I know exactly what you mean. Yesterday I happened to encounter a man as we entered the same building. He courteously held the door open for me. Appearing to be in his 60s, he smiled at me under his Obama cap. To all outward signs, an intelligent and gracious man, except for his spoken assertion that Obama would go down in history as one of our greatest presidents.I’ll admit it: I was rude to him. He asked if I was a Republican, to which I replied that I am a neo-reactionary. He shook his head and gave me a look that suggested he realized he was dealing with a lunatic.Being angry, I handled the whole situation badly. I was not “gracious.” I insulted him, and I’m kind of sorry for it. But although I have cut some slack for young people who’ve undergone the campus moron-breeding curriculum and with little experience of the world, it enrages me when an older man who speaks good English and seems well-educated is enthusiastic about an America-hating dictator-in-waiting like Obama.

        I have faith that tribalism will rise among the native populations, and old school Europe will not go down without a fight.  The white man has not always been the strongest one in the fight, but he has often been the most cunning, resolute, and co-ordinated with his mates.  The battle will be joined, eventually, and will probably be won by the West.  But what will be left?  And when the existing Western political institutions fail, which they will undoubtedly do, they get replaced with new ones that are often not to very many peoples’ liking, at least for very long.

        Not the West any more? We didn’t become fascists as a result of the World Wars … well, not all the way fascists. If the war is as lengthy as the Cold War, it would change us in ways we probably wouldn’t like, but I’d argue the West over most of its history was used to war and could handle it. Not the RECENT West, sure. But that’s doomed anyway.
