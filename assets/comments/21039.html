        And don’t forget the mental health angle. Many of these young women out on the streets screaming every day are surely suffering from some type of insanity or other, whether temporary or not. How they react to another Trump victory will be one of the great theatrical productions of the century. Bring your popcorn on November 3rd.

                That and the cop cameras.  people get to see nice and reasonable cops dealing with the nignogs.  Many are horrified.  That really backfiring in a humorous way.

            I once had the unfortunate experience of dating one of these types of women. She was medically diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Hypersexual Disorder, and Anti-Social Personality Disorder (Sociopathic). She was extremely bright, cunning, and had an extensive history of destroying her adversaries’ lives — whether former romantic partners and/or friends. She nearly destroyed my life, but we were equally matched and I put up one hell of a fight to out her and win. Nonetheless, it was a nightmare and still haunts me years later.

That’s a lovely image. A night of passion in a psycho ward. Any port in a storm, right?

        See there you Zman naysayers, the man is not a total blackpiller.Trump can win, should win, probably will, but then there is our old friend Chaos. Honestly though, the younger me would never ever believe the insanity that is happening constantly now. Can the center hold?

                            It seems to me a difficult sell wrt a dementia patient for President.  I can imagine every foreign enemy immediately stepping up and challenging US positions in the world.  Some might call this chaos and welcome it.  I tend to call it forever wars.

                There are still 190 million Whites in America, not even a majority, but still the strongest political force in terms of ability, money and arms.
Our principal disadvantage is that 1) we’re scattered and 2) we’re politically-divided.
Whether you want to play straight-up electoral politics or go with a 5th Political Theory physical and cultural rebuilding project, or something in between, the first thing you have to do is bring capable, compatible and motivated Whites together in meatspace proximity.

                    Problem is long term. “Demography is destiny.” Greg Johnson’s fantasies notwithstanding, we are not going to motivate non-whites or even recent immigrants to repatriate. Nor are we going to increase our birthrates. The USA being a democracy, that means that (depending upon election or court), that changes will be forced upon the minority the moment the majority hits 50.01% or 66% (for super majorities). Most of us believe in the idea of white moral and intellectual superiority, as do I, and the preponderance of evidence seems to support this  😀 No matter, once the dumber portion of the electorate reaches a majority, the country’s slow slide into the abyss accelerates. This is already obvious in majority non-White areas, almost always Democrat strongholds. My parents, half a century ago, said “everything happens first in New York (City) or California.” This rule of thumb still seems valid to me, and does not bode well for White’s (indeed, for anyone’s) future 🙁

                        Speak for yourself on birthrates.
The USA is already a democracy that’s losing control of its interior, periphery and even parts of its core.
It’s going to be a question of “Brown has voted – now let them effectuate it.”  Votes and power are two different things.
As things fall apart and there are fewer scraps to fight over, the immigration magnet gets weaker.  Greg for all my issues with him is not wrong on “the slow cleanse” concept – we just differ in tactics and timing.

                        Ben,Once they begin to understand the extent of their lost how many legacy Americans are going to come to see the democracy they were spoonfed was a confidence game stacked against them. Even when they voted for or demanded an end to non white immigration their votes were cancelled by courts and their demands were met with silence by the politicians they elected.At some point nature responds. When ‘by other mean’ gives you nothing and actively works to destroy you…’means’ is embraced and put to use. Even if we end up at around 30%, if unified we will be more than they can handle.—————-I’ve always taken GJ’s  take as an initial offer that will quickly implode.Like Zman’s reparations offer, it’s designed to make, from the pt-of-view of whites, a reasonable offer.  They may take a bite but for how long? They will resort to violence. When they do the ‘slow cleanse’ become the not so slow cleanse. The more they fight the shorter and shorter the cleansing period becomes.My guess is this is how things will end up working out after an initial chaotic upheaval.

                            “Even if we end up at around 30%, if unified we will be more than they can handle.” This. You expressed the same point I make over and over much more succinctly.The only people stopping us from turning this around right now, today, are other whites. If a day ever comes when a clear majority of whites feel the way we feel, it won’t matter how badly outnumbered we are.

                    Those places still exist, just not in the cities. I can be at the Chesapeake in 30 minutes, and the county where I live is still at least 80% white, in spite of our anchor ‘city’. Like you say, what keeps us divided is political ideology, and what will unite us is the growing threat to whites.The conditions are already there, and things are in motion. It’s happening on a generational scale, so it can seem hopelessly glacial to us individuals, but the juggernaut is stirring.Btw even the Amish up my way are now preaching getting involved in politics. They feel extremely threatened by the left.

                        Comparisons with DeGaulle are giving Trump a few more dimensions of depth than he’s displayed for four years.  He’s shooting from the hip and making gut-level decisions and he’s certainly not relying on any historical compass or guide.  Maybe some wonks around him think like this, but which one is he listening to today?
You can make a credible argument that Reagan’s amiable airhead routine was cagey fakery.  Trump’s persona is more WYSIWIG.

Yup, and in support thereof, one can cite Nancy Davis’ frequent whispering in Ronnie’s ears.

                        I find that position morally offensive.  It is Trumps duty to quell insurrection .
So he gets reelected, then what?  Allow the riots to go on another 4 years so Pence can get elected?
People are having their lives destroyed so the party that never accomplishes anything can ecke out another win.

                It isn’t what Trump does if he wins again, its what the hard left does in response. If CA, Oregon, and Washington start actual rebellions and try to seceed, or just the urban chaos continues while TPTB increase their “offensive offense” (trannies for kids, sportsball cucking, wear-the-mask mandates, etc) hundeds of thousands will be pushed out of the comfortable SOMA middle towards our side of the river.
If you want leftie to evict whites from their team, a Trump victory is a big step forward.

I can’t wait.I really don’t get what point people here are making when they ask what Trump has done for us.  It’s what he hasn’t done that’s important.  Trump might be a zero but Biden is more like -57.

        I’m still just amazed that it’s not just an old white guy, but a senile old white guy who is the Dem nominee at this juncture. But, I guess it does remind me of 2016 when all the other GOP candidates were even crappier, and less entertaining, than Trump. The GOP made the mistake last time and this time its the Dems fault they couldn’t find ANYONE better than Gropey/Sleepy/Corn Pop-story-telling Joe this time.Gosh, I wonder if Joe even remembers his good buddy Corn Pop now. Sometimes they say people with his condition can remember things from the distant past, but I believe that depends on those things actually happening. I doubt anyone can keep 50+ years of complete bullshit straight.

            A think we can’t appreciate from our vantage point on the political map is this. The people running the Democrat party fear the woke mobs more than they fear Trump or his imaginary Nazi army. They can deal with Trump. They can’t deal with the hair on fire crazies to their Left. That’s why the slammed the door on the Sanders campaign and installed Biden.The trouble is, the radicals decided to revolt this summer. This mayhem we are seeing is a war on the Left. It’s between their establishment types and their radical cohort. Imagine of the GOP had done this in 2016, installed Bush as the nominee and the alt-right started staging protests in the streets.

                I gotta say the image of AOC, eyes wide, in a torn and bloody peasant blouse (no bra), with arms raised and holding up the dripping heads of Chuck and Nancy, would make a great meme/t-shirt.
Also, I prefer the Invisible Nazis to the imaginary ones. even though you lose the cool uniforms, it’s just so much creepier.

                        I’m still waiting to hear how “Umbrella Man”, the radical in Minneapolis ? Seattle ? (I lose track) is supposedly a Hell’s Angel with white supremacist connections. That’s pretty good detective work, considering they have no suspect and no arrest. “White Supremacist” itself is suspect: even dumb old me knows that in prison, many White inmates decide to join the gang which often identifies as such, to protect themselves against the other gentlemen’s clubs in the prison I don’t wish such a fate on anyone, but I’d probably do the same. Would I remain a white supremacist after I got out? Not likely, but a race realist, yes. Just a hunch, but I’d expect many outlaw bikers do some hard time. But to call them “white supremacists” is as ludicrous as calling all Blacks in prison “Black militants” because they join a gang. It’s sort of like the saying “You’ll be gay for your entire stay.” Well, for Whites we can add “You’ll be KKK for your entire stay.” 🙂

                            It was an especially lame attempt to establish a false equivalency. It was abandoned because it was an obvious lie and the public knows full well the Left and its feral and communist shock troops own this lock, stock and barrel. It’s why you see less and less coverage of the riots even as they continue.I get many here do not like Tucker Carlson, and he indeed is a cuck, maybe a recovering one. But give the guy credit. He does bring these things to the fore. Especially notable was when he had on an FBI agent, brass from memory, who claimed they were investigating violent extremist from the Left and Right in regards to the riots. Carlson asked him point blank to name which groups from the Right. The FBI guy stared blankly and kind of blinked and uttered a non-response. Anyone who watched knew he was lying.The Left plans to label all opposition “White Supremacy” once it attains power and shuts down all the dissent it can. It appears a bad strategy so far.

And that’s if you even concede that SJWs are inimical to elite interests. It’s not like they’re calling out Wall Street or the military-industrial complex, they just want to wave their intersectional willy around, hoping that somehow it’ll accidentally slip into a slutwalker so they won’t be a virgin anymore.

No. Woke capital is financing BLM/Atifa for the same reasons they financed “occupy wall street.”
A. To keep everybody’s attention focus on the chaos while they further consolidate their globalist power.
B. Bioleninism has become a force the be reckoned with. So they have to keep BLM/Antifa off their ass.
C. Up their staus in the virtue signaling hierarchy.The legacy left are expendable to the project, as is everybody else.

In case you haven’t noticed, there’s always a civil war going on inside the left. Nothing will do except absolute power. Think french revolution light. With the jacobins being finance by laissez-faire capitalists.
Here’s something else you might think about.

                                        In case you haven’t noticed, there’s always a civil war going on inside the left.
So is the establishment allied with BLM or are they enemies?

Yes. Politics doesn’t have to make sense, it’s about winning.

                                            Neither and both. The establishment are older progressives, and overwhelmingly White despite their politics. The BLM crowd are the younger upstart White Millennial and POC progressives who wish to take the establishment jobs for themselves. Soros and other ideologes fund the latter against the former because they are fanatics spoiling for a fight; they have practically no loyalty to the US or the West and wish to see their ideology of race-hate take over, much like the old Bolsheviks who desired international revolution.The establishment is holding on for dear life, just trying to survive, but they are long for the tooth.The latter group will obviously win in time. Maybe sooner than you might think, at least in the U.S. Pelosi, Schumer, and Biden are all in their 70s. AOC is the future of that party. The posters here celebrating progressive activists ousting the old guard may come to regret that sentiment once the democrat party assumes permanent rule and establishes a China-style dictatorship with Stacy Abrams, Kamala Harris, AOC, and the Squad in charge. America is going full SinoVenezuela over the next 30 years.

                            The “Conspiracy 101” answer would be as simple as: Yes, you can finance your apparent enemies, if your goal is to stir the pot, in the likelihood that it will cause enough unrest or destabilization so that you can sneak through legal or regulatory changes that will benefit you. And, since it’s probably impossible to hide such funding or other support, you can legitimately claim that all you are doing is funding progressive social causes. In a sense, this is no different than the ancient observation that a small dose of a drug is a cure (or an entertainment, or both), but a large dose is poison/fatal.

                            Felix, it is more subtle. Certain of the rich do not see it as a rich v poor; it is “rich and poor of tribe A” against “rich and poor of tribe b.”  It is why the left hates destitute white hillbillies with the same passion as urbane, rich, WASP professionals.  They arent financial a revolution against the rich, they are financing a revolution against YT.

Global capital will have it’s way. But in the meantime, there are lots of tightropes to walk across. Financial, political, social and spiritual. It’s the long game. Lots of working parts. And nobody is fully in charge. So yah, things can get chaotic. But fear not, the archfiend has a plan. lucifer has your address Mr. Krull. And he has a place for you in his organization. So relax, everything’s going to work out just fine.

What Exile said below: just because they’re navigating a hurricane, doesn’t mean they’re not trying to steer the ship.
Antifa and BLM are managed opposition, down to the last weave. They’re establishment assets, not ‘radicals’, and the Cloud People don’t fear them anymore than they do being overthrown by Hollywood actors.

In fact, much of the Establishment is being replaced by the Coalition of the Fringes. Some Jews are Cloud People. Not all Jews are Cloud People. Most Cloud People no longer are even Jews hence their discomfort of late. No one in the Establishment or among the Coalition of the Fringes is a Cloud Person. They pay others to do that work.Bezos and Co. are paying BLM and Antifa to consolidate their power. They could care less about who ends up serving them as long as they are servient.You are more or less saying the same, whether consciously or not I don’t have a clue.

                BLM was obviously a planned and coordinated operation merely triggered by the death of Floyd.  If it hadn’t been him, then the death of any other black this year would have been the trigger.The point was to rile up black people to get out and vote for the dem presidential candidate and blunt Trumps overtures to blacks.But then it blew up beyond the plotters wildest expectations, and merged with the insane AntiFa left –  which has made it a crazy whi pepo thing – blunting the effectiveness of the original plan – and triggering a   yet to be revealed backlash.   The “eliminate the cops” rhetoric is a loser with every demographic group in the country, even blacks.The republicans could turn this into a complete route of the left if they could pull their heads out of their asses.  I doubt very much that they’ll be able to do that though.I don’t know how many here have seen this:https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/08/04/becerra-charges-lost-angeles-das-husband-for-pulling-gun-on-black-lives-matter-protesters-1304943The state da in CA is prosecuting the black husband of LAs DA for facing down a BLM mob with a gun at his front door in the middle of the night.  Trump and the republicans should be screaming about the blatant racism of the CA dem leadership and defending the right of a black man to defend himself from a white mob (so what if it calls itself BLM).The optics would rip the dems apart.  But the republicans are too big of “principled” pussies to play hardball

                    To your point, and interesting that it’s already largely forgotten, they did try this with the shooting in Georgia before the Floyd issue.  It didn’t “bite” though as the optics (despite an ocean of propaganda) were awful and they had to try again.

        There’s plenty of opportunity for “unity” – based on a desire to hunt down and eliminate us.

That unifying principle will evaporate the moment we’re gone, but at that point the mission is accomplished.

That’s how Haiti got off the ground – doesn’t matter that it’s been the world’s most violent s**thole for the two centuries since.

                If you don’t think there’s legions of white traitors out there, I’d suggest taking a drive thru any county with a 90% white population that voted for Hillary.  You’ll have no problem finding their public displays of self-flagellation.

                    I live on the outskirts of one of those counties. The fear among them now is quiet but palpable. The violence has shaken them, even some with BLM signs virtue signaling in their front yards. It is delicious.

                            It’s all so fake. These people are the first to quiver and cry when things get hot. I’ve already had verbal altercations with such people. They’ll engage in some kind of arrogant behavior, but once you confront them, they’re like a deer in the headlights. I’ve had these types call the cops on me after I verbally put them in their place. They’re not used to people standing up to them or resisting. That speaks volumes about how docile our society has become — and especially how effeminate men have become as most have no backbone.

                                It is so refreshing to see when real or suspected uber-LIberals decide enough is enough and bring out the firearms 🙂Witness the (St. Louis) McCloskey’s defending their castle against the white milennial protesters (I hope their charges are dropped), and more recently, the Black woman Seattle mayor who was similarly targeted by (I assume) similar protesters, because she wasn’t “woke” enough. In the Seattle case, White rich (and I assume liberal) neighbors still took it upon themselves to block entry to their communty and were visibly armed.

Do you suspect that if the charges are dropped, these people will just straight away return to leftism?
When I saw an image of these folks, my first thought was that when the machine came to eat them, they’d be asking ‘Why? We did everything right! We’re not racists!’… In much the same way that many gulag guests couldn’t believe Old Joe made such a mistake.

                        Seeing that GoodWhites enable most of the ‘get YT’ and white guilt attitudes and that they also currently abound in corporations as well as government, it may be reasonable to assume that when they are driven out, they no longer have any clout in the system – and this system will not listen to them.At this point, they’ll be either demoralized or they’ll double down in a desperate effort to get back into Diversity’s good books. Either way, they may be a spent force. At this point, perhaps lines will be as follows:Traditional communities policing themselves.Disaffected and redundant GoodWhites – the large percentage of whites.Some highly diverse and incompetent government, still looked upon as legitimate by Third Worlders and other new arrivals.The constant barrage of anti-white sentiment is massive, but it is also – to weaker more pliable minds –immenselydemoralizing when one sees it from ones own people. I do feel that once such people are removed – although immense damage has been done – the anti-white animus will die down as ethnics battle for scraps.

                            Absolutely. The issue is that even if a GoodWhite takes a real beating, they will stand around asking questions ‘Why did this happen?’, ‘How could this happen to me?’. Even if they come to their senses and see what is happening around them, they’ll still be one step away from seeing the necessity of violence… It’ll always be someone else’s job.

            There’s plenty of opportunity for “unity” – based on a desire to hunt down and eliminate us.True. But, I feel that one thing a close inspection of politics in western countries can yield is the sheer amount of infighting. Is it reasonable to imagine that once whites have been pushed out of large corporations and government (in background as well as visible roles) that the lust for YT will continue? I am not convinced, and believe that infighting among ethnic groups will eventually take center stage – at least here in the UK.The amount of animosity incomers from the ‘holes’ of the world have for other arrivals is staggering. How about Greek and Turkish animosity? Not to mention Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi grievances carried over from the mother country. Then you’ve got the religions to contend with, I just don’t see this mix functioning well as a government; at least not in the sense that it will be able to attack traditional white settlements. Of course, that depends on whether whites do form andprotectthese communities.

                I tend to doubt that. In both the United Kingdom and the United States, White Europeans are by far the most accomplished demographic and always will be; the entire history of these nations was based on those groups. So, no matter how small the White share of the population gets, there will still be plenty of points of resentment the elite can use to kick up anti-white hate among the imbecile POC prole class. In South Africa, Whites are a small minority but are relentlessly discriminated against and harassed with the help of social-climbing White females in the government and private sector. Even as Whites have fled that country en masse, plenty remain to torment the rest. I think based on this precedent that it’s extremely unlikely Whites will simply wake up and fight.The number of Whites posters here imagine have been red pilled is probably small in reality. In November, Trump won’t get more than 61% of the White vote and he’ll lose the election due to demographics; nearly every White liberal in Washington and Oregon States will be re-elected regardless of whatever has happened there. Blacks act exactly the same way, returning corrupt politicians like Ray Nagin and Marrion Barry to office no matter what they do.Conservatives and liberals are different psychologically, and that has a genetic basis. A significant portion of Whites, maybe 30% are essentially immune to the red pill. Their psychology is self-advancement through undermining rival groups (fellow Whites). That’s different from the conservative mindset that promotes group unity in order to advance self-interest; conservatives are amenable to building communities whereas leftists merely adopt convenient positions out of self-interest. That mindset is deeply ingrained and cannot be altered short of North Korean-style brainwashing from birth. In a very real sense, leftists are like parasites or viruses.

                    I take your point about South Africa, it is a very disconcerting situation. Additionally you point out that government harassment is help along by these white females. Quite a large swathe of the white race is it’s own worst enemy.Removing these whites from office may ease the harassment, in my view. I am not too familiar with South African politics, I suspect ethnic infighting would be a tribal affair, but in the UK, we have large bodies of people from a whole host of different backgrounds looking for their slice of the pie and here I think is the difference; the sheer diversity and antagonisms between groups is staggering.One point I will concede to you is that any white community will most probably be productive, and therefore seen as a target for extortion (heavy taxation). This is why the will to actually fight, not just by spreading the word, but with your fists if it comes down to it is so important. Whites have to form some sort of community, a place that they would die to defend, because there is nowhere else like it. You’re lucky enough to be born with such an instinct, but it is rare – it is even harder to cultivate.I know the last paragraph of mine may sound daft, but it really is the only way in the face of a grave threat. Recognize your situation, and change your mindset, at some point, violence is probably going to come for you – accept this, find allies, network, build.Apologies for the ramble, your point about the number of red-pilled whites I believe to be true. But, imagine what a community of only a couple of thousand could achieve. We know most whites are lost, a frequent theme on this blog is mention of most white’s capacity to double down on the leftism even in the face of obvious danger, but they were not our people, and they never will be – as you say, it’s genetic.

                                    Hmm, depends on the type of nationalist you are. I don’t mind germans settling in my country, or any other white. If you’re the type who cares not to mix your bloodline with other ethnic whites then yeah, germans were on the wrong. I am of the opinion a child of scandinavians who moved to Italy will behave similarly to italians because their cultures &amp; sensitivities are very similar. I don’t care either way.The problem with nazis is that historians push to the front the most extremist of their kind(Hitler was not one of them) wishing to make them look like lunatics. Hitler married a jew, he obviously cared not for pure germanic blood.I am not claiming nazi ideology was amazing cause it wasn’t, I am claiming they would have removed satanic jewish influence from Europe, their little aryan obesessions were nice and all, I don’t take them seriously, Germany had slavic allies in the war.

                                    Hitler clearly had territorial ambitions on historic Slavic and otherwise non-German land.  He clearly believed in “right of conquest” for all that his supposedly-world-spanning ambitions were Brit/American intelligence fictions (the Brits famously admitted to manufacturing the “Nazi Future Western Hemisphere Map” FDR used as a prop).He was a Nordic supremacist who saw Anglos as brother-Nords but Slavs as inferior but for the Rus-descent elite in the Kiev-Novgorad-Minsk-St. Pete-Moscow set, who were initially Nordic and repeatedly re-married into German bloodlines.  Many were more German than Slavic.Bear in mind this is pretty much how Germans and Scandis in general saw things back then, as well as a lot of Anglos.Had Hitler won, you would have seen Germany take a large chunk of Poland and Ukraine, particularly the black-earth breadbaskets and Finlandize the surrounding territories (France, adjacent E. Europe) under allied hard-White regimes.Which would have suited a lot of Europeans in general just fine and arguably turned out a lot better for them today than Soviet-US bipolar dominance and the current Clown World shitshow.

                            Hitler liberated Orthodox Christians who were being slaughtered by the Bolsheviks. Further, many Orthodox priests volunteered for covert missions along the side of Germans who air-dropped them deep into Communist-occupied territory so that they could move discretely and sabotage targets of interest that were under control by the Soviets. There are many of stories about how Russian Orthodox Christians welcomed the SS who they saw as liberators.

                        Yes and no.  I like Poles, and yes, a lot of them tend to be extremely good looking.  But the Brits – like the French and the Germans – deserve to have their own country.  While Whites are similar, they aren’t fungible.  Rather than blaming White Brits, blame their handlers who forbade any criticism of the subcons and Caribbean blacks.

        A lot of people believe in the concept that history always moves in the progressive left direction. So when they see BLM and calls for white people to atone, decades of conditioning induce a pavlovian response to follow. This is why suburban whites, suburban white women specifically, follow suit. To them, the option to push back or go another direction induces the conditioning that they’re the angry whites shouting at innocent blacks going to a formerly whites-only school in the 1950s like they saw on TV.Yet at the same time there’s the gnawing feeling that it’s not right. So in the era of forced corporate unity, polling shows that everyone, minorities included, think the country is going in the wrong direction, even when Obama was embracing grievance politics. We will never have unity and talking about black unemployment rates or “criminal reform” isn’t going to do the trick. The only solution is that white people need to think of themselves as an identity group. An uneasy detente is the only outcome that doesn’t need to Rhodesia and South Africa. Trump will not help us, we’re going to have to figure this out ourselves.

        I am, thankfully, retired and don’t have to deal with the diversity bullshit anymore. The last year I worked, the team sent an especially offensive diversity training video mandating proper worship of every type of human defect and perversity imaginable.I sent them an email. I told them that, next time they wanted to do this, they should just send me a pistol in the interoffice mail and direct me to eat a bullet. At least, I would not irretrievably lose 90 minutes of an otherwise productive life. (Sometimes I can be a sarcastic SOB).The responder at least had a sense of humor.

            I must be lucky.I had a mandatory workplace sensitivity training last year, led by a black woman in corporate.  I was expecting 2 hours of woke and instead got common sense things like “don’t be a dick”, “examine context before getting offended”, and “don’t invite a female co-worker to sit on your lap”.  Basically, ‘don’t be a retard”.We’ll see if it’s the same in 5 years.

        There may be reasons not to count Trump out in November, but there are many more reasons not to care.Re: tiger-riding, there is no reason why a reasonable person shouldn’t recognize that:a)  Societal forces cannot be perfectly controlled and unforeseen consequences always happen (“no battle plan survives the first shot”);andb)	 cabals of (((influencers))) who enjoy outsized money, political, media and academic power still do everything they can to steer the tiger at their own enemies first and unjustly profit from the chaos left in his rampaging wake.For example:https://www.unz.com/estriker/national-justice-exclusive-zionist-groups-plan-multi-front-assault-on-free-speech-over-zoom/If society is just a roil of tigerish chaos, untameable and unrideable, why do guys like George Soros and Peter Thiel spend so much time and money  on influence operations?  Why does the entire lobbying industry exist?Obviously there is some benefit in having a hand on the tiller, even in the worst storms.The reason why Con, Inc. isn’t a tiger-slayer is because it’s controlled opposition (see “lobbyists” above).  We live in an oligarchy where the Left’s donor class holds power and works with Con, Inc. to keep the rubes betting on this rigged match like it’s legit.It’s a much superior kosher-sandwich system than the Soviet one-party cafeteria (you can have any color you want, as long as it’s Red).The illusion and burden of choice is very distracting and much more resilient and useful in deflecting and grounding out popular resentments and dissatisfaction.

            As for (b), their future is the fate of Eliot Engel. The tribe historically has overreached, and their feral foot soldiers view them as Super Whites. I generally agree with you, but let’s not see the drivers as invincible because they most certainly are not. In 1922 the tribe was the power center of the USSR and poised to control the world. Ten years later it was reduced to mush. Ten years further out they were mushier. Ten years further out they were back to near-control.As for the Jewish Supremacist push to stifle free speech, that has been well underway for almost a century and has in fact been very successful. I would submit, though, it hit its zenith around the mid-Seventies with the Fairness Doctrine, full and total control of the propaganda outlets and popular culture, and the blind fealty to Israel. Those persist but to much lesser degrees.I sense their decline has started. The spectacle of the Anti-Defamation League begging for PPP money is what we expect from them when they are producing and peddling porn and circumventing tax laws.

                When betting against the Tribe, you should always keep this bad card in mind – it’s a permanent feature of whatever hand they’re holding.
The guys saying “give up, Jews have too strong a hand” don’t realize they’re always holding this permanent deuce while Whitey gets to play all 5 cards.
We don’t have Jewish levels of built-in neurosis, hyper-aggression, disagreeableness, perversion, greed and a boundless inferiority complex.
They always own themselves (e.g. “We Will Replace You” headlines).  The trick is being determined, ruthless and positioning yourself to capitalize on the inevitable opportunities.

            Beautifully crafted phrase “the illusion and burden of choice.”  That is really what operates not merely politically, but culturally and economically throughout the US.  And people keep channel surfing through life because they now have a ‘choice’ of which version of indoctrination they prefer.  You can have 25 types of detergent, but not the one that works because California banned it.  You can ‘plan’ your family and finances, but the economic and social premises you base your choices on will be eroded and shifted faster than you can commit to them.

        What we may witnessing is not a revolution, but one of those times when the Left forgot they were riding the tiger and toppled off, only to be eaten by the tiger, or in this case, his keepers.It is both.The idea behind the riots and violence was to make people think they had to elect the Left to make the madness stop. The strategy worked until a certain point. You could tell the moment when state-sponsored domestic terrorism had started to outrage the public. It was when the propaganda outlets stopped broadcasting the violence, which is ongoing, and revisited Covid as the greatest horror ever.The perpetual revolution continues, though. It is the tiger after eating the rider who fell off. The tiger does not care about polls. You are absolutely right about the Left’s much superior political instincts. The fly in its ointment is its recklessness and impulsiveness. We see those wrinkles playing out, too. The Left usually wins. When it fails, it does so spectacularly. This is one of those moments. As you point out, it is trying to recalibrate. The revolution doesn’t care.The images will last a long time of the unmarried, childless and psychologically damaged thirty-something white women melting down over any pushback against the privileged child communists and their feral black remoras. In the digital age, a “long time” means more than six months.I don’t know how the election will shake out. I would not have bet against Trump even prior to this madness; my anger about his inaction lingers but as a political strategy it has proved solid. As I previously have written, the only reason to re-elect Trump is that it will force our evil, corrupted State to further discredit itself. The last few months have borne that out.

            The left has always had its crazy, unhinged element, but the the party was controlled by more sober minded individuals (at least they postured that way) who played the long game and realized burning down buildings and other mayhem was bad optics. Now, as many have noted, the sober minded are checking out and the lunatic fringe has taken over. It’s now a matter of how much longer the center of the country puts up with this shit.

                Actually, the visibility of the looniest of the radicals probably works to our side’s advantage, not only by showing we are mostly right, but also forcing the Liberal Whites to show their hypocrisy (e.g. 2nd ammendment). As I explained above, even super-Liberal whites in Seattle saw fit to blockade and be visibly armed during the recent “woke” protesters’ visit to their posh neighborhood.

it will take very little live and personal experience with violent crime to turn them into cop felating anti- crime zealots – especially as they age.

                    Unfortunately many are damaged beyond repair. They kept riding the carousel hoping one day Chad would commit. He never did. They have a burning hatred of white men. They also have no future since they are childless. They are also depressed, alcoholic, and likely want to die.
So why would they care what their future revolution brings?

        That 2nd paragraph was pure gold!  It is extremely weird that gibbering joe is apparently the left’s standard bearer.  For most of the past 50 years (until the last two), they’d have the younger, more dynamic candidate facing off against some geriatric old fart – what happened?  Trump is a fairly old goat himself, but has the energy of a man half his age.  He needs to get it cranked up soon to truly fire up the base – here’s hoping for the best.

        The problem for the Dem establishment (older Jews and gentile Whites) is that the younger generation (both White progressives and POC) actually believe the propaganda that they were taught whereas the establishment understands the propaganda for what it really is: A lie to gain power. That’s the inherent conflict within the party.The Dem establishment just wants to win. They don’t want a revolution. Sure, they want to take a bit more from Whites and give it to their minions, but, generally, they want to run a country that acts like it did 30 years ago but with more ethnic restaurants.But their growing base – Woke Whites and POC – want to follow the logic of the Narrative to its natural conclusion. And that means massive upheaval. They want equal outcomes and Whites (Badwhites in the minds of Woke Whites, all Whites in the minds of POC) punished.The problem for the Dem establishment is that their base is growing ever more impatient. They can’t understand why the establishment doesn’t push harder, why it doesn’t seem to live by its ideals. The base wants action. How long can the establishment hold off its own base?

                Actually, the progression seems to be the Left allies with the Marxists who take over because their willing to commit violence but then idealists are weeded out by the realists (Stalin) who understand that it’s really just about power and not ideals.
Either way, the Kulaks are shot immediately or shipped off to gulags where they probably die anyhow, so we know where we’ll end up.

        Good post.  My only addition is that sometimes forest fires are caused by firefighters who seek to be heroes by then “finding” and leading the effort to extinguish the fire.  We may be seeing that mentality at play–only the election of Joe Biden can put an end to this chaos.

                I’ve heard this as well, but never could figure such out.  The fire fighters we have here come from professional teams that work and train together and are sent as needed all around the country.  It’s a job and these guys are together during the season, training and doing whatever, until sent on a fire suppression mission.  Never seen a case where a bunch of lay abouts are grabbed off the street to aid in such effort, albeit in all these matters, civilians often volunteer wrt supporting the fire fighters’ efforts in back of the line.

                    If it matters, from my memory, in VA and WV in the late 70s/early 80s. They don’t get forest fires on par with the West, but they happen. Never lived on the tinder, er, West coast, but from news accounts, it’s almost not an exaggeration to say, flick a cigarette butt out the window and a whole State is afire 🙁

                        Interesting. Having lived in both Appalachia and the tinder-box known as the Mountain West, I’ve always wondered whether there were ever any significant fires in the Appalachian region. It’s something that I never bothered to research. Nonetheless, it always seemed unlikely to me because of how much water is found throughout the region in addition to the lush vegetation.

            It does seem that this may be what they’re doing.  Basically, hold the country hostage until we knuckle under and elect Zombie Joe.  The people most angry about the rioting and shutdowns though were already the least inclined to vote for him and now have rage driving them to Trump as well.

        BLM is not a tiger, it’s not grass roots, it’s 100% created and controlled. OK, maybe 90% controlled.  BLM was everywhere in 2015 and then overnight it was gone. BLM was a non-entity from the time it disappeared in 2015 until late May of this year when the media decided to make a circus out of the next black man that fought with the cops and got himself killed.They may very well have unleashed a tiger, but it was them who brought the tiger into America, agitated it and then let it lose in the streets. Democrats were the incumbents and they didn’t want the chaos BLM was creating. Re-election is an endorsement of the status quo. The Democrats benefits from maximum chaos.

                The uncontrolled rioting and burning of buildings is not contrived by the DNC. And it hurts them badly, which is why Trump is allowing it to happen while only making threats (promises) to stop it (after he’s re-elected).

                This is precisely one example of falling off the tiger. The BLM golem is once again beginning to stumble out of control, and perhaps this time no amount of mandatory book reports or field trips to synagogues will be able to get it back in line.

            I think Black Lives Matter quieted down after the killing of 5 police officers and wounding of 9 police officers in Dallas in 2016. They say on (((Wikipedia))) that the protest march was organized by Next Generation Action Network, but I remember it being associated with BLM. Probably a little historical revisionism happening there.That incident marked the first time a civilian was killed by police with a robot detonating an explosive. Glad the shooter was killed but the robot use is downright Orwellian.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers

Why in god’s name would anyone be kvetching about black  slavery in Europe and Australia? From what I know, the Africans haven’t even been Australia a single generation.  Australia has the unfortunate situation where they have a population even worse than Africans (don’t sleep in the road and don’t be rama rama).

            Agreed. Their problem is cobbling together these coalitions of the fringes, Bioleninism, as it has been described, is tough work since elements are hostile to one another. The idea that it would be non-White vs. White was compelling but difficult, especially since it is largely White progressives who were the masters.

        There is no center.  The left is moving more and more rapidly leftward.  The right is moving leftward, but more slowly.  But while there was some substantial overlap between the left and right 25 years ago, today there is almost none.Pew conducted a survey June 8-18, 2017 and published a timeline with the headline “Less Overlap In the Political Values of Reps and Dems”.  In 1994, 30% of Dems were more conservative than the median Reps and 36% of Reps were more liberal than the average Dem.  In 2017, only 3% of Dems and 5% of Reps were in the same position.There are two Bell Curves separating from each other faster and faster.  There is no America anymore.  The only solution is some sort of separation, hopefully a peaceful one, but there must be a separation.

        I don’t generally buy into conspiracy theories, but the whole BLM/Saint George Floyd thing is so pervasive, so monolithic, that I find it hard not to suspect a hidden hand behind it all. Perhaps Zman is right, the Crazy that reigns this summer is just the result of an unfortunate confluence of events, or the fact that our masters all sing from the same song sheet, but from my naive POV it sure looks orchestrated.If the Dems win in November, I can’t imagine the chaos that will ensue. For that reason, I pray Trump comes through — he leaves a lot to be desired, but the thought of a black woman president (once Joe is gracefully retired) makes my blood run cold. We will be off to the camps in no time flat.

            There was quite a bit of coordination in anticipation of the next black thug killed at the hands of a white cop. It initially was tried with Ahmaud Arbery, but he was quickly revealed as a typical black criminal piece of shit. So a few weeks later George Floyd, also a dirt bag but that wasn’t as quickly known, served as a stand-by. The same appears to have happened with Covid. The coordination was in place to crater the economy after the next predictable virus outbreak.These are not conspiracies but long-term planning. In fact, think back to the summer of 2016. Obama was instigating violence every time a black criminal was killed at the hands of cops. While the accusation that Gates and Fauci specifically, among others, were ready to pounce may or may not be a conspiracy theory, that they were prepared to do what was done is established at this point.

After the many, many,manyexamples of anarcho-tyranny in the recent riots, I no longer care what happens to the cops.The most recent example is from “based” Texas, where a scumbag sheriff paraded a sticker guy in a jumpsuit in front of the media as if he was Al Capone, yet the same sheriff allowed BLM and Antifa rioters to run wild, forcing locals to defend their monuments—and the sheriff arrested some of those locals too. Fuck the police.Anarcho-tyranny was well-established long before the current riots, of course, such as the way red flag laws are used to kill—yes, kill—white randos for the wrong political beliefs, yet at the same time not a single illegal gun can be preemptively confiscated in our chocolate cities.

            That case really shows how far the rot has spread in Texas.
Meanwhile Harvard Law’s cowboy gunslinger Lyin’ Ted owns the libs by reinforcing fake memes of White violence and peddles more colorblind CivNat hopium in another showboat hearing that will accomplish nothing.

                I will be delighted if I’m proven wrong in November, but I also just don’t see the evidence that these riots have become a tiger the Dems have fallen off.Judging by the overall “meh” reaction to two months of the worst rioting since the 1960s, most people seem to be either sympathetic or indifferent. There is no evidence whatsoever of any kind of political backlash.Speaking of politics, I also don’t get the Z Man’s constant ricocheting between black pills, red pills, and blue pills. One day he’s given up on the GOP, the next day he’s speculating on different political timelines as if politics matter again. One day he’s baiting the readership with JQ snippets, the next day he’s inveighing against the JQ.Say what you will about the TRS guys, but they’re far more lucid and consistent. Z Man is witty and talented, and a superb writer, but he seems to be stuck in a fog of confusion and incoherence, lurching from one position to another. The TRS guys come off as far more confident in where they stand, what they’re doing, and how they’re reacting to all this theater.Even one of the Derb’s listeners noticed this and the Derb commented on it in a recent podcast.

                    The Z is actually on the pulse of where the wind is blowing. Some days it blows strongly against Trump then Biden announces blacks all think the same and you wonder just how many will actually vote for him?One day the GOP looks like cannon fodder for leftists then the next day they look stronger and might just hold up then they are back to being cannon fodder.Its all in flux right now.It could go either way for the GOP and Trump in 2020.The ZMan reflects what is happening in the world.

                Is “Lyin’ Ted” Ted Cruz?  Every once in a while a politician says something that takes me aback, and makes me wonder who he/she/insert pronoun here/ is beholden to. When the question of drug supply chains came up he said something to the effect of “we need to move our supply chains to India or Israel.”   Not the US, never the US.

        One factor of the upcoming election I haven’t seen discussed is what happens to the 5% of the vote that was split between Gary Johnson, Jill Stein and Evan McMullin in 2016. The Libertarians have nominated lifelong party lackey who put out a platform that sounds like Paul Ryan for total drug legalization. They will revert to their below 1% norm. What happens to the rest of these voters? I would guess no more than a third of the McMullin voters refuse to the vote for Trump, although the only close state he had a significant vote total in was Minnesota. Jill Stein had a million votes over her 2012 total, do those voters still vote for the Green party? The Libertarian roll off is the most significant part. These voters could tilt a couple of close states.

        The other delusion is they truly think they are the moral leaders of our society and they are fully in control of this machine they have inherited.
This is actually/practically the entireraison d’être of politics in this modern era of ‘diminishing concerns’ — this is why they spend so much time doing and saying what they think they must in order to demonstrate theirmoral fitness to lead.Otherwise the plebs might begin to suspect politicians are largely the useless fucks they indeed are.

        One side is full of crusading vigor while the other is seething quietly and nervously, having come to the realization that it’s spent the past few decades floating from one flight-of-fancy to another and another.  The first group sees the election as its sacred final passage while the second sees only an unreliable windbag who  at best may act as a temporary stop gap measure.  If the first group finds an election result not to its liking they will litigate and recount until they get their desired outcome. The invertebrates leading the second group won’t say a word in protest. Well, maybe a word but that’s it.  As social media battens down all hatches and set the tone for herd America the invertebrates don’t even talk a good game…Do something? Why are you still asking at this point…As Red voting districts increase their requests for absentee ballots by 800% their Great White Hope is poo-pooing any and all forms of mail in ballots.  While 40 million people remain unemployed (who knows what U6 really is) the R party is cutting benefits and making access to any new ones more and more difficult to access…as money continues to flow into the coffers of the well heeled and into the anti white swamp. How’s the demographic shift worked out over the past 4 years?  2018 and a handful of election since then are a sort of bell weather, how have they worked out?Z’s right about the rising tide of white sentiment rejecting what’s happening…but for many they don’t see any place to go…and many won’t, go to the polls that is.

                        This has been their biggest mistake, not allowing a potentially very powerful enemy any means of retreat or ability to publicly vent…and thus periodically reduce any building pressure.

            Legitimacy-bleed has reached terminal levels.  Low turnout + ballot tricks in November will produce a toxic hellbrew of accusations, recriminations and finger-pointing reminiscent of 2000. The electoral college will not be with us by 2028, likely 2024 – states will no longer have any significance on a national level, reduced to administrative subdivisions of the North American Province of GloboShlomo.
But an increasing number of Americans just won’t care because voting doesn’t matter.

                My money is on 2024.If they have both houses and the executive branch in 1/21, then one of their first acts will be to grant statehood to DC and PR.If we’re going to get kicked I want it to be good and hard so enough of our people stop hemming and hawing and come to the realization that they have to do more than grumble or support the next based Republican.Assuming Trump goes down, by Thursday or Friday Rubio/Hawley will be getting more coverage than Biden will in an attempt to quiet the restless natives before they put that newly awoken energy to bad-white purposes.

                A side note that bankruptcy protection for the states would formalize this as states seeking to alleviate some of their debts will be assigned a Federal minder to be the one who is actually in charge.

        The fact is, the people in charge and responsible for the mayhem we are seeing, are not master manipulators controlling the system. They are not play 4-D chess to maintain their power behind the scenes. They are riding a tiger that they poke and harass on occasion, without realizing it.I am not Z-man but I do agree with this message.The problem is that the left is that they stopped believing in God a long time ago. That means they are open to believing in the State as their God. They intend to bring heaven here to this small planet.Christianity has Satan as the great enemy to our heavenly father. The left has the fascists. And damn if most of the normal people are not fascist even if they don ‘t know it. Z-man mentioned in some post or the other the leftists can’t be persuaded by facts, figures, reality, experimentation, and so forth. They are living in a magical world where they will force reality to conform to their religious expectations.We need to cleanse the country of our ethnic enemies; but we really need to cleanse the country of the insane leftists. They can not be de-programed as far as I can tell.

        I’ve always felt that Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, all of the very old Democrats have always known that they’re riding the tiger.  These days they spend countless hours attempting to keep all those new AOCs of the party from wrecking the place.  The old coots in charge of that party are more disciplined than anything underneath them.  They worship money and power, not ideology.  As evil as they are they’re smarter and more disciplined than the GOP ones too.  Part of this is that the best and brightest of the left go into the government apparatus at some point.  Given what’s coming out of the so called top tier universities, the best and brightest on the left are now going into tech and have been for awhile.  This leaves a no talent vacuum on both sides of the aisle.

        If the Left was smart, they could have federalized the police and created a form of reparations and gibs to blacks unprecedented in history. BLM had momentum, sympathies across the spectrum, a compliant media, and a willing ruling class. They threw it all away to riot and cause mayhem in cities all the while failing to use their advantage to push far-left legislation. The Right was on the ropes with their arms down and the Left whiffed the knockout blow.The minute one side or the other stops being the stupid party, it’s going to get interesting.

            If Trump wins, it could be different this time due to how crazy and openly lawless the left has become trying to reclaim power. The problem is not Trump’s smarts or instincts, which are good, but that he’s actually too nice of a man to crack down and be the authoritarian figure we need him to be to destroy the globalist leftist creeps. He needs a little more Bolsonaro or Pinochet in him. And yes, that indicates the US has devolved into a corrupt hellhole, due to the outsiders that rule us and due to the millions of low quality, low IQ dark people from incompatible cultures that we’ve imported the last 50 years.

                Again, the only reason to hope for a Trump re-election, and it is a good one, is that it will sow an enormous amount of chaos, possibly even a refusal to acknowledge the results and a military coup. Expect nothing substantive from that since there is no political solution to our crisis.

                    You’re right, I need to remind myself of that. I keep falling back on the thinking that our authorities will correct themselves and we’ll go back on track, but that’s no longer the case. (Maybe never was.) That was the old USA, now gone.

                            “Buying time” versus accelerating the debacle isthequestion for the d-right in the election of 2020.
Personally, I go back and forth about which is more likely to be advantageous. The situation is unprecedented, so 2020 hindsight (see what I did there?) can’t predict the alternative outcomes.
Whichever strategy one favors, it will be important to keep a close watch on both macro and micro events before the election. In the bizarre world we now inhabit, some kink we can’t imagine yet might be a game changer, and offer a clue about which way to bet.

                                Good points. I always am open to new evidence. Whatever option would produce the most chaos is where I am. Right now I think a Trump re-election would cause the most because the Left either will ignore the results or go on an even madder rampage. As you point out, that might change.

                        Time for what? For the last 4 years the right has been spining its wheels. Do you honestly see that changing over the next 4 years? I don’t see anything on the horizon. Everyone who tried anything was shut down or shunned by the right.A Trump victory would almost certainly result in the same: the right goes back to sleep and things get worse as Conservatism Inc. consolidates its hold over the party. Trump may even do something stupid like start a war with Iran, which would further damage the party.

                    Since my guess is as good as anyone’s for the coming election, here’s yet another disturbing scenario. I don’t think a military coup is very likely. If I recall my US history correctly, if the popular election is botched, the whole thing gets decided by the House of Representatives. This is bad enough in itself. But I think they could elect absolutely anyone they please. Even in normal times it’s scary enough that Pelosi is third in line for Presidential successon 🙂

                There is a small possibility that Trump, self-centered and lightly disciplined as he is, could go full Pinochet after a re-election.  It’s not like he has much else to build for, given the Uniparty and the future demography he faces. But I wouldn’t bet on it.  I basically will vote for him to tweak the Lefties, but their further discomfort is about all I am looking for, out of all of this.

                    No chance for full or partial Pinochet. Trump likes his life, his assets, his heirs, and his comfort a good deal more than he likes your liberty. The wealthy are going to have the same liberties under any system we are likely to see, if not more.

                All of that assumes that Trump is on OUR side – which is a notion I’ve completely abandoned. My unproven theory is that Trump ran to secure a political future for his kids, that’s it. How else would you explain bringing in Javanka to the WH? I forgot the pundit’s name but there was one woman who made a good point – Trump NEVER laid out any specific plans during his candidacy or even during his presidency. It’s all been jingoistic crap like MAGA and “we have the greatest economy ever ever”. Not a single realistic policy proposal was ever voiced by the Trump campaign.It sucks that I realized this later on. Fool me once…

            It’s been said a thousand times, so here is #1001: The problem is notillegalimmigration, the problem islegalimmigration. You could build the most formidible wall imaginable, but if your policy is to let anyone with an H1B visa or a claimant for asylum, they get invited in the front door, and are given room and board.

                You are right, but it is both as well.  I’ve never read of a criminal act by an H1B VISA holder.  But there are myriad incidences of criminality every year by IA’s.  Both spigots need to be turned off, but if one were more important or rather prioritized over the other, then it would be IA’s—and as I’ve said before, a wall does not solve the problem of IA’s as Trump would have the naive believe.

        On Wednesday, a group of 20 House and Senate Democratsintroduced a billthat would amend theFederal Reserve Actto require the central bank to operate “in a manner that fosters the elimination of disparities across racial and ethnic groups with respect to employment, income, wealth, and access to affordable credit.”(from Amren)Elimination of disparities means taking from you in one form or another and giving it to them.  It is putting into law the legalized discrimination against whites and the confiscation of their property through direct transfer, devaluation and other means deemed effective.This goes on already but largely through regulatory manipulations and subsidies.  It will now be the law of the land, no longer needing surreptitious clauses. So it will be full speed ahead.

            I was just looking at the Fed’s site yesterday. One of it’s goals that jumped out at me was that the Fedconducts the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the U.S. economy;From an economic perspective fussing over maximum employment and stable prices seems to be a result of people being obsessed with the concept of fairness. Perhaps price controls and tariffs are important in certain sectors – and they can definitely be used to create a certain effect – but our economics now seems geared toward being fair… And by that, as you mention, it means pinching my hard earned bread and sticking it on DeShaun’s table.It comes as no surprise that such a bill has been introduced by the usual suspects. Which economist was it that brought about an obsession with ‘full employment’ as opposed to ‘maximum production’?

        My view is that Russiagate wasn’t really the DNC attacking Trump or the GOP, but indirectly attacking the Leftists in their own ranks and push the Dems in a more Neocon direction to satisfy the (((donor))) class.The DNC and it’s media pretty much destroyed their best bet for the future in Tulsi Gabbard thanks to Russiagate. It’s obvious the DNC honchos want Kamala Harris as the Vice for Biden since she is their pockets.

            I see it more as a “prepared leadership” thing, ready to not let a crisis go to waste.  Lefty has a giant binder full of plays for various catastrophes, developments, world events, etc.  Like obits for famous ppl, they’re ready to go once the body hits the slab.  For example, the DNC just happened to have a 2,000 page $3 trillion relief bill ready to go within days of when DNC governors shut it all down for the COVID freakout;  all of the gungrabber stuff works this way. Every time some nutter shoots up the quickie mart, some Dem has a comprehensive legislative bill introduced within hours.

        Good post Zman, nice to see that you’re back on the medication. We all need something more positive from time to time, if for no other reason than to keep hope alive. Personally I’m hoping for a second wave before November, this time of “muzzle rash”.https://www.thelist.com/233001/do-face-masks-really-cause-cold-sores/

        there ARE secret cabals, not just one. which is why it’s easier for the Left to adjust and ride the tiger, they fall back on their committee/soviet structure and spread out the errors. like steel plates absorbing shock: one day the extreme left gets hit hard with “defund the police” backlash, the next day the center left back pedals and says they support the average cops and whatnot. thus the left’s communal spirit helps them on the defense, but when on attack they gather too much trash and poke the mob’s tiger too much eventually.the Right meanwhile is always said to be very individualistic and therefore ineffective, but i disagree somewhat. the individualism helps when multiple lines of attack are needed, ironically turning into a communal effort of organic groups attacking the enemy together. we saw this in 2016, as Trump united all sectors of the Right with him against Crooked Hillary; it wasn’t just a nat-pop party, although it sure felt like it since it had been a while nationalism had been finally listened to, but the GOP and all diverse sectors of the American Right were there. while this attitude is good on the attack, defending is when the Right becomes a mess, as the individualist tendencies split apart the platform meant to be defended. this of course happens now, as the center right/GOP is sometimes even a worse enemy of nationalism than the left, and both split up are no match for it.while of course i would say that in the long run nationalist-traditionalists would hope the center and the left die (and the cabals are done with), in the short run we need a cohesive platform under Trump with the center-right again, to be able to hold some sway in American government. if there’s no more major upheavals, he simply should hammer home what he’s done and what he can do, both for whites and nonwhites, poke Biden’s racial-socialist tiger some more while also steal his thunder moving left on some economics. in short, the 2016 strategy, but calibrated to an old fool, while Trump appears as the sheriff in charge in comparison. that said, if you create chaos Donald, better own it. specially now that dissent is squashed harder than in 2016 and support is near samizdat levels in some sectors, while covid-1984 rules get tighter. the dumb middling white independent needs convincing, after all.

                    You have both changed my mind 180°.
I shall vote harder this time.
My only question is should I vote for the empty vessel with the agenda to actively destroy me and my way of life, or the “known quantity” that passively does the same, but with “dogwhistles” that make me feel good?

                                I’ve come to the conclusion that while Trump is fairly useless, he doesn’t actually hate us. The democrats do. And the Republican establishment does also, and actively aids the worst parts of our society. So I’ll vote for Trump, though it doesn’t matter that much where I am, and will oppose any establishment Republican. And don’t bother with arguments about how we have to have the senate to nominate S.C. justices. That’s old and tired.
