        Right after the verdict, my business-colleagues were celebrating, while also whining about Trump being too rich and powerful to actually serve some time. They seem to truly believe that the oppressed class has just won a fight in a long war against the all powerful White billionaire patriarchy.I never talk politics with them, because it wouldn’t lead to anything good… but I couldn’t stay quiet and asked if they realize that to outsiders, this looks like a political trial, precisely timed to destroy an opponent before election. All I received back was a bewildered look and no verbal response. I think they now suspect I may be part of the White billionaire patriarchy (just without the billions on my account).

            You could not have said it better, Hun. I just talked to my best friend…I started out by quoting “What is happiness? To crush your enemies…to hear de lamentations, of de women” in my best Ahnold voice. I wanted to hear his elation.
I asked him, “Is this our Charlton Heston moment?”, since this all is the lead-up to the Planet of the Apes.

            This idea that a power-mad government would step up and say “I am going to jail my political opponents because I am a power-mad lunatic and I am evil and that’s just how it is going to be” and the population just shrugs and nods (because they are evil too, just in a banal way) is so ridiculous, but it is also implicitly what decades of Authoritarian Personality/Mustache Man propaganda leads people into thinking. When the Venezuela government jails political figures and outlaws parties, they’re bad, but when the American government jails political figures, and when the German government outlaws parties, they’re good, because they’re telling us they are doing it for a good reason.

                The argument of hypocrisy on the part of the Left is of no value in defeating them as they have no shame.  It simply distracts from time possibly spent in  more fruitful pursuits.  However, such argument seems the mainstream in conservative media.  Somehow the “normies” never tire of hearing of it and expounding upon it via call ins.  If you tune into any conservative talk show, no more than 15 minutes can pass before an example of Leftist hypocrisy is cited and if no current examples are in the news, show hosts will create a straw man and use that to discuss Leftist hypocrisy.What’s with us?

                    I agree with you, but my point was not about hypocrisy. It was about the fact that, for example, the USSR had a Constitution which included the right to free speech, assembly, and religious worship. I wonder how many boomers even know that. Yet despite that, everyone knows exactly what I am talking about when I say the phrase “Soviet Show Trials”. People don’t understand that the Soviets didn’t go out there and say they were going to stage a bunch of fake trials with the procedures and courts stacked against them for the purpose of crushing dissent and harming political opponents. They said, oh, these people are being prosecuted fairly for breaking the law as it is written and enacted and with respect to their rights. The exact same thing Democrats said yesterday at the conclusion of this American show trial.

                        Trump was “prosecuted” using the Team Red rule book.  Team Red rule book says a Democrat judge working with a Democrat DA in a Democrat city with Democrat jurors and a Democrat media can charge you with ANYTHING THEY WANT and convict you.  And you can’t even speak about it in public or call witnesses in your defense.
I don’t know that anyone will react violently to that, but in human history there have been revolutions for far less than the power the Democrats just wrote down for themselves in the Team Blue rulebook.

                    I agree.  I’ve said for years that calling them hypocrites is a waste of time.  Instead, I talk about the two rule books.  There’s a Team Blue rule book and there’s a Team Red rule book, and those rule books are not the same.  People who are hypocrites are mostly just dicks and people have varying degrees of tolerance for that.But tell them they have to play by an entirely different set of rules, and that Team Blue writes the two rule books with the explicit intention of f**king you over and people react differently to that.This Trump thing is a perfect example.  He committed no crime.  The crime they accused him of was a misdemeanor which they declared to be a felony just to get around the statute of limitations, and they ran a rigged trial with nothing but Democrats from top to bottom.That’s the two rule books in action, and it is going to throw people into fits of rage.

                This is why we are in the consolidation phase of a communist* coup. The mopping up can only start when enough key demographics have been so thoroughly propagandized they buy into the biggest outrages. This conviction pales in comparison to throwing open the border but the symbolism of the formal abolition of the trappings of popular government is more immediately noticed.
*Most even if some of the new totalitarian are not communists but it’s the best descriptor.

            That almost seems to be the second lesson of today’s show. You can’t argue with these people. How can you hope to reason with them when they are perfect and virtuous and you are evil and hateful? Or they don’t have the intellect to frame a reasonable debate?Fear not – for these people will take care of themselves. The other day on OyTube I saw a poor elderly jewish prof, trying to get into the building where he taught. But he couldn’t get in – a bunch of rag headed mud flaps were protesting for Palestine and wouldn’t let him pass. It was all awfully antisemitical, and the poor Jew sputtered with rage. I think it was McGill…the same liberal hive that produced Jordan Peterson.I got sent to the time out cell when I laughed and said that this jewish shitlib voated to flood the country with human trash and he was merely reaping the whirlwind he created! 😂😂😂👍It won’t be long now. At length race reality will force these idiots to shut up and actually listen.

                The entire kangaroo court is the Democrats telling us there will be no peaceful coexistence.  They can accuse, try, convict and sentence us for any crime they want, even if a crime doesn’t exist.  We cannot call witnesses in our defense nor can we speak about the trial publicly.  They will hire a Democrat judge and use a Democrat jury and the whole thing will be riggedThat was the point of yesterday.  This was Democrats saying they can do anything they want to anybody they want for any reason they want.  And there’s nothing we can do about it.I really do think normal people see this.  Not the rabid partisans, but normal people who can’t figure out why eggs cost 3x more and they can’t buy a house or afford to raise a family in a safe neighborhood.  The question is what they (we) are prepared to do about it.Because Democrats just gave themselves a license to kill.

            I have a friend at work who complained that some of the guys were being “discriminatory” about a dude trying to turn himself into a woman.  Rather than get offended, I just said, “You can’t turn lead into gold.” and shrugged.  Her eyebrows shot up because she had never heard it put quite that way before.  She had no argument for it.  But I also know I said something that truly made her think without getting hostile.I’m not required to believe things that are neither true nor possible.  Good for you for speaking up.  I’m lucky to work someplace where my coworkers haven’t gone uniformly insane.

                RWers, in general it seems no matter how “far” or “hard” they are, ultimately care about the opinion of libtards and emotionally need to justify themselves.Libtards don’t.
Libtards can’t model or explain rightwing positions because they don’t care and simply write you off as evil.

                    If they refuse to ponder both deductivistic and empirical explanations of phenomena, then you are required to confess to yourself that they only react to PSYCHOLOGICAL appeals.Then the question becomes: What is their psychology, and (((who))) precisely is manipulating their psychology?A coupla decades ago, I started to realize that classical political argumentation was an utter and complete waste of time, and that only psychological methods &amp; psychological explanations would get us out of the mess that we’re in.Furthermore, I also came to realize that psychological personalititties are determined AT CONCEPTION, and that there is effectively nothing anyone can do with these badly malformed personalititties, other than simply trying to outlive them and outbreed them [unless you want to get into the psychological mesmerization &amp; hypnotization bidness].And finally I realized that, at the end of the day, even psychology itself is nothing but just another Darwinian horror show.Eventually adominant psychological personalititty type will emerge out of the current disaster in which we are mired, and all we can do is hope &amp; pray that that emergent personalititty will have a positive view of our hopes &amp; aspirations.It not, then that likely means we’ve all been democide’d.

        This was an outstanding show.  Bravo.On the subject of “equality” and all of this equity crap, it has really destroyed everything.  Let’s look at the corporate world and job interviewing.  I work in software, a profession that is somewhat demanding on intellect and requires, at times,  deep critical thinking skills.  Hiring poorly results in great cost and can even sink an entire company depending on its size.  Now that we have to hire blacks or women (girl boss!) the productivity levels have sunk to record lows.  Not only are these mutants incapable of performing, but now the productive folks have to stop what they’re doing and do the work of multiple people.  If you deny these people the job or fire them, the reason is always because of “racism”.  No other reason is even considered now.  If you hire a black, you have now signed on to employ them forever.  They cannot be fired once they are in.  You can’t reject them either because the only reason you are denying them access to the job is because of their race or sex.  It couldn’t possibly be anything else…A close friend of mine is a-political.  He ignores most things as much as he can.  He’s an architect at a small tech company and they have a team of 4 developers who do immense amounts of work.  They hired a new engineer who was inexperienced but seemed to be at least somewhat qualified.  Turns out that this person was a tranny and was forced into the role by upper management in order to keep the diversity harpies off their back.  This thing was hired only as a contractor.  As the contract was coming to an end, my buddy decided not to renew, since it wasn’t actually working, and was having all kinds of mental issues.  Extremely poor performance and not showing up for work wreaked havoc on their team.  When he made the decision not to renew, the company lawyer got involved and told him he HAD to renew the contract.  “You can’t fire this person, they’re trans.  If he were a straight white male, this wouldn’t be a problem.”  Those were the exact words coming from him as he was telling me about this.  It took 6 weeks, but he was able to finally terminate the contract.  After this finally got resolved, we went to lunch and I had my “I told you so” moment.  He admitted I was right and he decided he will never hire any of these types of people ever again.This is where all of this leads.  What’s even scarier is where this is being applied the most is in medical schools.  You are soon to have thousands of surgeons who have 95 IQs at best.  Pilots who have no idea how to operate the complex controls of planes during a crisis situation.  Everything that was built by White intelligence has been destroyed, and if you even question it, you will lose your job, be thrown in jail or even outright killed.

            So you stop flying (as we did).  You get all possible medical care and surgery now (why we had lasik done for both our boys).  You plan on concierge medical and dental only.  You withdraw as much as possible from the current system.  As debased as it is, bits of it still function.  That is eroding daily and most people assuming it will endlessly continue in its degraded form.  They never, ever carry the degression to its natural endpoint, but it’s coming nonetheless.

                Concur. In my view it’s actually more merciful that change, deterioration of what we thought of as civilization in this case, come gradually. If nothing else, it gives people more chance to adapt. Quoting them somewhat out of context perhaps, a Talking Heads song ended “And as things fell apart, nobody paid much attention.”

                Dr wanted an ultrasound done, come to find out there is only ONE radiologist for my entire county and it has called in sick….PS, my vehicle is still under warranty so the nearest dealership is an hours drive away, which mandates I have a friend or relative follow me there so I can get a ride back, because the dealership must keep the car overnight, then I have to ask/pay someone to again drive me down and follow me back..plus the work wasn’t fully done as the mechanic didn’t really want to get his hands dirty before lunch.My homeowners insurance sent me notification they will no longer be offering coverage (too many claims and not enough premiums being paid in), now I have to scramble for new carrier at twice the price..

                    Do you own the house, or is there still a mortgage?If you own the house, then stop the structural insurance immediately.Instead, get just a $1 Million liability insurance policy from the likes of USLI [it’s a Berkshire Hathaway product, with an A++ rating, and it’ll cost you maybe $300 to $350 per year].On average, structural insurance has been a catastrophic waste of money for homeowners during the last half century.Over the decades, since 1974, you would have become many orders of magnitude richer had youinsteadinvested all of your structural insurance payments into the stock market.

She told me the client had an “it” on the team who had similar problems: Showing up late, not focusing on completing work, causing all sorts of “drama” with the team talking about their transition, etc. After trying to get the team to finish tasks and reporting “its” poor performance to management my co-worker basically told the client “It goes to another team or I go.”The client didn’t renew her contract.The kicker: My co-worker is a black woman.The victim stack is nicely defined isn’t it. One wonders if the team can even get anything done in her absence.

                    Current “software engineering” is now 100% fads and 0% actual coding. Just in the last 3 years or so, this new thing called DevOps has taken over everything. Basically you MUST be able to navigate the AWS or Azure console and be up on Scrum and Agile. Actual software design or knowledge of particular languages and toolchains seems not to matter. Many jobs now just have a list of programming languages and it’s OK if you know one of them. This is interesting because your work consists, or should consist, in developing software in some particular specific language.I’ve seen job listings where they would accept skills in C#, C++, Python, or JavaScript. I’m always tempted to ask these people “so what do you actually USE in your work at this company?!?” because those things are wildly different in typical deployment. No worries though, as long as you can mumble your way through a scrum “stand-up” and start a program using AWS it seems you don’t need to actually know how to write that program in the first place. So the corporate enstupidation monster has now swallowed SWE along with everything else.I’ve brought this up on Reddit and other places and the only explanation anyone offers seems to be that these jobs are actually fake. There’s no actual job and they posted it to make the company look like its growing so the investors will be fooled. Alternately, the whole department is about to be moved to India and they’re posting fake jobs so the American devs won’t get suspicious and quit before they can be fired.

                    Trump just won the election, if they’d let him participate in it.I have a feeling that this is just turning into yet another episode of “Permanent Revolution U.S.A.” that our managers must manage. These people thrive on crises; it’s the only way they feel anything…like a teen girl cutting herself and showing the scars.Trump will be allowed to campaign. But the election will be rigged again.Canned election night analysis after Biden gets 270: “Well Tom, those lawsuits really hurt the Trump campaign, and turned off much of his base. Biden, who brings “no-drama Obama” to mind, is largely seen as the candidate of stability.”

I have three dissident sons and a dissident son-in-law and I know what that means for them and their wives and my grandchildren. A bloody future awaits them when the gloves finally come off and the regimes are confronted and fought. Thus I pray that the regime sees that change is inevitably coming and they back down. So when we criticize the “vote harder” bloc, realize that it is mostly a prayer for avoiding what we know is coming.

                I will confess that a tiny part of me was hoping that there was some tiny vein of sanity left in the system; that some part of it was still looking out for it’s own long-term best interests and that we’re not just ruled by lunatics, but, yeah, it’s not something I didn’t know.  “Disappointment” more than “Disbelief”

            Tired Citizen:  Don’t hold your breath.  My husband has a smart and cynical friend, for whom the system has worked very well.  He, too, used to think my husband’s predictions of coming changes were verging on tinfoil hat territory.  He has long since admitted my husband was proven right in all particulars.  Yet . . . he has made NO changes in his life to accord with the changes in AINO.  Still thinks his sole child can live the same lifestyle as he has, despite all evidence to the contrary.  Still thinks his fed pension and investments will always be there to insulate him.  Thus far he’s been right on that – but any financial upset/crash and he’ll be sh*t out of luck.  I genuinely like the guy, but admit I want to see him face reality good and hard.Point being – normalcy bias is incredibly strong and your friends will soon revert to “It will all work out.  The system is good.”  And they will make no changes or provisions to deal with things somehow not “working out.”

            I was wondering about this myself! I haven’t followed the trial but every day I would read on Revolver News (which, on the whole, is a decent site) about how Judge Merchan got “owned” or how Cohen got “destroyed” or whatever. Thus telling me that people still believed that the system was going to work as intended. I thought, when Trump gets convicted, are people still going to believe this? Are people going to understand the fix was in from day one and Bragg coordinated with the WH (either directly or through intermediaries)? Are people going to understand that the system hates them and wants them dead, FINALLY?

                In all probability Merchan did get owned and Cohen did get destroyed many times over, and it didn’t make a dam’ bit of difference. That should tell you something.
Revolver is rather like Michael Anton–one foot in the DR camp, the other in Grillerville.

                    Yes. One got owned and one got destroyed. But it was all figurative. It reminds me of how in middle/high school the blacks would say something incomprehensible and say, ‘he be clown’ you &lt;n-word&gt;.’It is all juvenile – at best. A healthy society would witness Merchan and Cohen lying and getting exposed as corrupt liars and then say, “What a disgrace. We must destroy them.”Instead we settle with the impotent banter of the black table in the lunch room. It is a horrific disgrace that we have permitted ourselves to become. Of course, when the government set about on its citizens with guns and bayonets to end freedom of association, it is hard to blame the citizens for behaving according to the reality that might makes right.

But Conservative Inc. Media was paid to talk about RFK Jr. and the clot shot and so now we’re supposed to vote for him or something.

            “Maybe it’s finally starting to sink in?? Maybe???”And what if it IS starting to sink in? What are they going to do about it?Nothing. They are going to have to suck it up and deal with it like the proles in every totalitarian society.When a drug addict with a felony record died in police custody of a fentanyl overdose, the Left burned cities and rioted from coast-to-coast. Congress and the police got down on their knees to beg forgiveness.When the leading presidential candidate of the white proletariat is convicted on transparently bogus political charges in an election year… crickets.White man gotta get up and go to work so he can make his truck payment.You are now living in the Soviet Union. If this was 1937 and you were some peasant on a collective farm and Pravda reported that a member of the Politburo just got convicted of being a Trotskyite traitor to the Revolution, what were you gonna do about it? You were going get up at the crack of dawn and to go out and pick your quota of potatoes.And if you stole a potato for yourself you would get shot.

The Right (conservatives, or whatever you call such, but not simply DR types) are not the same as the Left. We simply don’t chimp out every time we get “disrespected”.  As much as I’d like to see some changes in our overall behavior, it runs very deep.  It’s something we need to recognize and work around—if possible.

            The domestic coup was with the 2020 election — between permanent vote by mail fraud, electronic voting fraud, the “broken water pipe”, etc.  Trump won every bellweather county and voting counting was “paused” for 4 hours and then the results thereafter totally changed.  The globohomo coup was successful – this is just cleanup.

            It’s not so much a coup as a decades-long march through and conquest of every institution of society, including the federal government. It came to its fruition when Joey Depends was inaugurated. Everything we’ve seen since is a mopping-up operation.

            I feel the “position” of Trump’s that I most agree with is the one where he extends his middle finger. I really don’t much care what the rest of his platform is about at this point and the guilty verdict from yesterday just strengthened my resolve to vote for him.It has crossed my mind that we’re all being played and that all this lawfare is a convoluted way for the establishment to make SURE he wins because they now feel confident that he won’t do anything to drain the swamp, fix the border, end the Green New Deal programs, etc…

        “The low-level zombies who charged and convicted Trump are not very smart and they seem to lack self-awareness, so they are most likely acting on instinct.”

            yep, the big news is really about how people prefer to live unmolested and alive.  as a juror would you make a stand for justice in ny environment?  think about it.  we are nearly an anarchy, with half the population believing the rule of law.   the other half doing everything possible to undermine the rule of law and the destruction of civil society with no consequence cosigned by the government(more so in ny).  its simple self preservation.  shxxxt the mob boss deniro in ny even got his message out to the juror’s.i suspect a juror making the stand for justice would not make it out of town alive.  peer pressure with the threat of violence and no protection is a strong deterrent to give up your integrity.  Any knowledge of a functional justice system is not considered when fighting for your own life and your loved ones.it is failed.

            In 95% Democrat New York, everyone on that jury was selected for their reliability. There was no “lone voice of reason” on that jury.  If there had been, they’d have been removed because the other jurors would have ensured their removal.  Guilty on 34 counts for a nonexistent crime?  That’s partisans on a jury doing their part to allow Democrats to kill anybody they don’t like.

            Has anyone noticed the race of the lead prosecutors in at least the Atlanta and the New York cases? Due to the hurdles imposed by professional qualification, I find it difficult to believe that blacks are a significant fraction of attorneys (and thus state prosecutors) even in major urban areas. A cynic might suspect these people were specially chosen for their race, to send a message. The flimsy nature of the charges in these (all?) cases too recalls the stereotypes of incompetence. But is that a bug or a feature?

                Behold the fruits of affirmative action. But this is affirmative action on steroids. In the past the nuggras who were socially promoted at least had a modicum of competence and intelligence. Nowadays it seems they’re dragging a net through the worst part of the hood and whatever idiotic and bizarre trash they come up with, they install in the highest offices they can find. It seems that for the rulers, we can’t fall to third world status fast enough. I guess they figure whites will suffer the most in a third world environment.

                    “In the past the nuggras who were socially promoted at least had a modicum of competence and intelligence. “Yep.  Some basic analysis will support your observation.  WEB DuBois spoke of the “talented tenth” in his speeches 100+ years ago.  He recognized intuitively what HBD study proves today—average Black IQ is 85.  This leaves one SD of the Black population (14%) at average White or above level. The talented tenth of the population can be expected to have greater than an IQ of say 103/104–no great shakes—especially if we are talking lawyer level.10% of 50M is 10M, 75% are too young, or too old.  So we have a pool of possible competent, working age Blacks of perhaps 2-3M to fill various job descriptions. That ain’t much in a nation/society of 350M people.  In short, those numbers of “competent” Blacks was *used* up long ago and the *gap* is now filled with any Black that can fog a mirror and report to work more often than not.The reason we see more of this incompetence in the legal profession is government insistence on AA.  Larger, private law firms either get better Blacks, or restrict them to lessor cases.  Blue city governments get Blacks voted in and they promote their own to these legal process positions and the results become more apparent.

        The guy giving the opening remarks is completely wrong.  We have no prohibitions against discrimination.  In some cases, discrimination is not only OK, but is mandated.  What we have is selective discrimination.  We discriminate against White people and especially White men all the time.  It is not only OK, but required in at least some circumstances.
The idea that we live in anti-racist society is comical. We live in the most race conscious society that has ever existed.

        People around me are gradually becoming more willing to speak against the new religion (once they look around to make sure it’s safe).  They are noticing that being around people from other tribes (blacks and Jews in particular) is unpleasant and they’re tired of it.
The noticing will continue and white tribalism will grow despite all efforts.

        Here is what is happening.First the historical context. Anglo-Saxon America invited huge numbers of non-AngloSaxon/Germanic people into the country to fill our factories with workers after the continent was largely settled by the pioneering sons of the founding stock. They knew they had a problem and did the correct thing. They halted immigration and began an intentional project of assimilating Southern European, Eastern European and Irish (Catholic) peoples into the country. Had they done this halt and spent 100 years consolidating their gains and focused on the continent we would live in a near paradise. However, fate had it that some of the peoples who came in through Ellis Island had European pedigree but whose entire history was defined by being either outright subversive or indifferent to European people. They stepped into a power vacuum and filled it.They also stepped into an ongoing cold civil war between the Northern and Southern aristocracies and a new column – the merchants (industrialists). A mere 40 years after the halt, the ascension of global dominion and commitment to maintaining it the gates were thrown open. Here we are.As for the debate, a bunch of interlopers have come into this broken polity and its mostly broken people and found a place. This parasite doesn’t know what positive rights and negative rights are. It just knows that an existing sinecure with promises to gain better sinecures are handed to it on a silver platter. Join the fight to discriminate against white people in the name of the so-called right to keep people free from discrimination and the world is hers.I don’t want it to be this way, but, this is all about race. In the end, this is about which race will dominate this continent. If it weren’t blacks in America who are incredibly successful would be satisfied that they got their big juicy piece of the pie (Oprah; Emmit Smith; Lebron James; ), the way Europeans are. But, they are not. Neither are the new arrivals from South Asia, East Asia, the South America jungles and favellas.The European system of good-faith debate of issues that can be resolved through rational discussion because the most fundamental issues of kinship, blood and soil, identity, nationhood, are settled is finished. Europeans in North America need to wake up and realize that this system of debate is now stacked against them. The subversives of the 1910 – today have destroyed their system. Now the newcomers are taking sledgehammers to its hollowed out foundation beams.This is now about survival. We aren’t going to survive by pretending the debate club determines the outcome. We are going to survive by amassing in numbers as a united tribe that discriminates on behalf of its own and that behind it carries the threat that if we do not get our way the debate is over and we will defend all that we hold dear. If we do that, we can form healthy, thriving redoubts and recover much of what we have lost. From there we can resume our destiny – the one where we didn’t need any outsiders to get us to the moon; to send our probes carrying a golden record of some of our titanic achievements out into the cosmos; to build a world the entire world wants desperately to have. If we continue with the squabbles with the underhanded who know time is on their side, then all will be lost.This is a white pill. We can do it, but we need to wake up and realize we are waking up in the middle of a game where our civilization and our lands and our children’s existence is the prize. In the name of Alexander, Alfred, Octavian, Aurelius, Columbus, Magellan, Champlain, Drake, Lord Nelson, Shackleton … … we can and we must rouse ourselves and make our stand.

        I think every American who grew up here of a certain age, including myself, always lived with the idea that the country was special and unique, as cringe as that may be today. Certainly nobody ever contemplated the thought that the people in charge would use their power to prosecute their political enemies and stifle dissent. Well, I still think we were right – that country would not do that. Yet, as we all know, we don’t live in that country anymore. We now live in a third world mutantocracy, and this is just what they do in those countries. You can’t have America and these people in charge, as Vox Day says, there is no magic dirt, it is one or the other.

        Anti-traditional whiteness is a religion and the faith of the adherents is affirmed daily by the news and entertainment products of the hegemonic media.  Not only do the faithful have the goodness of their faith praised continually, the vileness of traditional whites magnified, but all evidence that may disconfirm their faith, like crime statistics and the unflattering parts of the histories of the non-whites, is suppressed.(My brother in law solemnly told me that our Founders borrowed their best ideas from the wise natives, because NPR says so.)I don’t see a way to break the spell without the destruction of the hegemonic media, either by direct action or societal collapse.  It is the source of the spell.My faith is that many whites, certainly not all, would be salvageable if they weren’t continually inundated with anti-traditional white hatred.The most consequential force in multi-racial societies is racial tribalism.  Whites are at a great disadvantage because we are the least enthocentric, most individualistic, most gullible, and have a significant number given to utopian campaigns against reality.

            “My faith is that many whites, certainly not all, would be salvageable…”
Some, less than half. They got on their knees for BLM (“I need my MLB…bleat”) — they rolled up their sleeves (I actually had an acquaintance, an attorney, tell me he was getting the jab “to go to sports events..”) — they put paper on their faces outdoors.
So no, most “whites” are not “salvageable.”

                You may be right, but it’s also possible that many of them simply can’t think for themselves.  It’s not their fault; it’s just the way God or nature made them.
If we were dictating their morality, instead of the current media, they might be productive members of the nation.  The policemen who disgracefully kneeled, for example, could probably make valuable contributions to their community, if properly directed.
But I want to agree with your larger point:  there is a strain of whites that are spiteful mutants (Dutton) and should be treated as such.  They are cancer in our collective body.

Again, the only peaceful solution is to politically neuter them—earned suffrage.

        The Left will never be satisfied with what they childishly think of as “victory.” In the Zoom meeting my wife regularly attends every Friday morning with her old “swim club” pals (a bunch of liberal hags), there was no gloating this morning over the verdict, contrary to what one might expect. She informs me that there was nothing but grousing. Grousing over the reactions on the Right. None of them can conceive how anyone can think in any way different from how they think. My wife remains quiet or mouthes vague anodyne platitudes, a talent she has developed for decades. I’ve learned over this same time-frame not to disturb her dream-state. If I probe, she throws up her hands and declares, “Tom, I don’t know!” But my point is, the Left will never be satisfied. We truly live under a nightmare condition of totalitarian goodthink that even Eric Blair would have had trouble imagining.

            Like I always say, without something to agitate against, progressivism ceases to exist. It NEEDS an enemy. The progressive must always see himself as the underdog, battling against The Man. Obviously it’s comical watching them maintain this mentality today, but maintain it they do.

        Who says?  Society says.  The reason society says so is because the people of our society are subject to nonstop propaganda from the time they are children.The recent affirmative action case is a perfect example.  As soon as affirmative action was shut down, all these “scholars” started coming out saying how colleges and employers could remain technically in compliance without changing their behavior!  WHY?  Because all these people assume less of whitey in and of itself is a moral good.  We’re at the point where so many people believe this that they don’t even need the law.While normal White people were busy living their lives, the enemy completely changed the society.  Every generation is worse than the last in this respect, which is why it continuously gets worse.  Each new generation is more steeped in anti-Whitism and diversity worship than the generation before it.

        Well that was just a spectacular show again Z.The second that chick started blathering I knew she wasn’t worth listening too. I might disagree with you though – she is NOT saying she has the right to impose herself and her values on you. She isn’t smart enough to think with that level of objectivity or dispassion. Most dirt women can’t think on those levels; I think she is saying her feelings are what’s important, that anything that makes her feel bad is your fault, she is the perpetual victim who is morally pure as the driven snow. It’s typical liberal – what’s the term – “gynocentrism”? I have heard any number of white women make the same noises. All she is, is a parrot. Certain words work when these imbeciles are trying to manufacture consent… and judging by the way things are going… there isn’t a lot of consent anymore. The elite are being forced to impose consent through corrupt courts as we saw in the Trump fiasco.Something stupid this way comes – and I hope all you dissidents are smart enough to stay in front of it!Have a great weekend you guys.

            That “US Citizen” was an Arab, a Yemeni I believe. He wasn’t an American. He was an asset of the GAE who got citizenship in exchange for doing covert ops on behalf of the empire.
Everytime the opposition opens its mouth it validates the worst premises of the enemy. In this case, “Any person can be a US citizen.”

        I have an old friend, we grew up together, who had always been a lefty. He was (A) a huge 9/11 “truther,” believing that 9/11 was staged by the MIC as a pretext for intervention in the Middle East on behalf of oil companies. Then later, he was afflicted with (B) a horrible, horrible case of TDS. Subsequently, he became (C) a triple jabbed mask zealot. I have been at a loss to comprehend the progression from A to C, and too averse to his political tirades to ask him about it. He doesn’t watch much TV news, I don’t believe, since he doesn’t have cable or the internet equivalent of cable.

            The evolution of pretty much every American libertarian organization (and a bunch of disappointing dudes we could list) suggests that being a conspiracy-minded follow-the-money noooticer represents not intelligent resistance to propaganda but a first “rational” step onto the slippery slope toward becoming a left-establishmentarian.
NO WAR FOR OIL, e.g., is well within the permitted range of “protest” slogans. You can pose as antiwarthat way. Following the money is situationally encouraged. Just don’t follow it into certain zip codes. Etc.
The regime maintains a space for people whose dissidence consists of wanting to feel like clever critics.

            In another time, Alvin Bragg, the black who charged Trump, would have been a local pimp or a successful hustler. He is probably high-90’s IQ. The judge is probably 105 and would have been a bodega owner or something similar. The elites promote the best diversity they can find into these roles for spiritual reasons. The results are what we see.

                Yep.  This topic—low IQ—and the results of placing those folk into positions of authority under the guise of “equity” always seems to come up through examples repeatedly posted here.  Perhaps you could in the future to devote a dedicated column, or series of columns, to thrash this topic out.Just what will a future of such entail and what will we expect to see occur as we traverse toward such a society.  For example, we’ve had an incident reported on here of a plumbing company sending out a “plumber” who was caught watching YouTube videos on his phone to figure out how to do his job/repair.  Replace YT with AI and I can see a Brave New World about to descend upon us.Another topic I was involved in recently was our new “computer on wheels”, the modern automobile (since I bought one recently).  Seems as near as we could figure, we no longer own the car we “purchase”, we just pay a type of “lease” fee in advance, since we don’t own the software, can’t modify it nor view it, nor can we even refuse upgrades or modification.Perhaps this leads us to talk about futures rather than current events, but those things are of interest as well.

                    “…most NPCs arebicameral, that is, not fully conscious.”Thus my usage of “breeder brain,” versus “neutral neocortex.”I realized some speech- religious speech, in particular- evoked the immediate and very emotional gut punch of opinion. I came to the conclusion that since language serves two, not one, functions, there are two processors or processes; the term “bicameral” serves very well.(Those two functions would be the emosocial, immediate signalling of tribe and sex; the ultimate goal of social maneuvering is ‘who effs who’, that is, social positioning. This would be the older of the two, the monkey barking of women and nonwhites.Whites, for reasons, use the neutral neocortex much more than any other demographic; so profound was this change Nature marked us with our many colors and the light skin of high status. We are less emotionally involved, more fair, and ended up building 97% of everything since we ask “How does it work?” instead of “You sweatin’ me, punk?”  We are the upgrade.Note black’s facility with women, or smol hats facility with telling morally charged tales. They all speak the same manipulative language, that of the social breeder brain.Cog diss, doublethink, or not knowing what to say happens when words get stuck between the two processors. Passions or neutrality depend on which plexus is dominant.Again, the term “bicameral” serves very well, although I have yet to read Jayne’s or associated works- thank you Clayton for the link.The Zman’s use of “religion” is intuitively on the mark, their software thus circuitry channel different from ours.)

                        There is one (or more) documentaries of ESKOM, South Africa’s power company, about its woes with subheadings such as “How crime and corruption turned the lights off…”I haven’t actually looked at the documentary but one doesn’t really need to waste the time doing so. I’ll merely jump to conclusions and assume that the liberal weenies who made these documentaries dance around the fundamental issues.Perish the thought that anyone would inquire why the lights stayed on until the early 1990s and then things began to fell apart. Why, better break out the smelling salts and the fainting couches.In another context (about the failure of an airline in that part of the world), I recall a White making the wry comment on a blog “We all know why it failed, but we’re not allowed to say it.”The path that nations such as South Africa and Brazil have or are currently treading probably offer us the best insights into what a multi-racial and ethnic America or Europe will look like.

                            There are YouTube videos by SA’s formerly in the business discussing ESKOM.  They were former managers who were replaced by the current Black government according to their new quota laws (anti-White discrimination).The SA ESKOM problems are painfully predictable—an intersection of Black low IQ (incompetence) and Black propensity to resort to corruption (graft and other thievery).As I painfully witness in my city, the SA government does not know how to run a country and ESKOM illustrates such.  The government did not provide funds—or rather reduced funds—needed for maintenance and expansion.  What happened to this funding one can only imagine.  Time preference is not big in low IQ Blacks.This incompetence is also witnessed in water supplies to some of the major cities now that their has been a decade of drought to exasperate the issue.

                    Well, you might see more of this in the future as more low level employees realize that the diversity hires that “manage” them don’t actually know how to train them because they don’t know anything. Looking up a video on YT might actually be the most responsible and sensible thing in those places.One place you’re already seeing this is software. Corporations are hiring all kinds of rainbow people directly into managerial roles. For a rank and file software engineer asking your manager how to do something might get you fired, not for not knowing it yourself, but showing that the “manager” doesn’t either.

                    interesting thought to project the idea of npc.  npc to be a human who does not or will not have that inner conversation?  to put away the conscious mind is not in alignment with self preservation.  could it be the npc really fails to acknowledge the inner conversation? or the inner conversation only comes to light when the flight or fight response is initiated?  im having trouble grasping the idea of no inner conversation in visibly functional humans. is this term npc another name for the mental illness cognitive dissonance?  i see cognitive dissonance regularly.  i recall as a child the act of talking to yourself out loud was frowned upon and considered weakness and then moved the conversation inward.  As an adult, i have acquired the “i dont give a shXXt” and do both inward and outward.   are these npc’s products of learned behavior?  seems to me this is an important topic for functional civility.   this idea gets even more complicated for those who consider the spiritual realm and how words speak volumes of how we interact spiritually.  i.e.  personally i refrain from speaking about evil and its master.  i figure if i speak anyone’s name it will be christ.  to complicate further.  some are of the mind the world we live in is conscious construct of all beings.  meaning if every being believed the world was civil, it would be so.

        There are three things apropos of the new Religion and Trump’s conviction.The wages of Christianity are cuckery. I wish it were not so, but it is. There is a straight line from Christianity to the new religion of cuckery.Cuckery does not scale. There is nothing in it for almost ALL White men and they know it, so rebellion against Christian Cuckery (without Christ) is built in.You cannot run a continent sized plus empire up against non-cucked, intelligent and resource rich opponents and win. Defeat of the US is guaranteed against Russia and China.Yes the new religion is materialistic universalist utopian heresy out of Christianity. As noted in the American Affairs journal, it is a toxic mixture of Puritan cultural “elect” who exist in a “sea of wickedness” as tiny points of light, with emphasis on education and a carefully concealed hierarchy, but one the more rigid for being denied, with Quaker universalism and worship of blacks, gays, etc. This is not the first time such heresies popped up: the Gnostics, the Cathars, etc. It is a problem of Christianity that Christ leads to cuckdom, always in the end. Nietsche was sadly right about that.The FT had several days ago the rise of “right wing extremist” parties in Europe appealing to the “young” (not said but conveyed through pictures, only Whites and primarily White men). The new religion BY DEFINITION denies any upward mobility for White men. Period. Full stop. No career in the law, medicine, scientific research, anything. Over 50% of UCLA’s medical school class are DEI incompetents who cannot pass any medical test and were admitted as unqualified. Young White men in particular need achievement in a deeply atomized, commercialized society. In order to attract a woman. THAT primal desire has been destroyed by the new religion so organically creates those interested in burning the whole thing down not converting.If we don’t have nuclear war with Russia and China, we are in for a long struggle. That requires investment of high IQ, highly motivated White men as mercenary criminals from South America and Africa and the Middle East are only good for internal jackboot roles. As noted above there is no reason ever for White men to fight for such a system and every reason for them to sabotage any attempts to defend the system.Successful religions scale by converts. It is noteworthy that in Europe there are nearly no White male converts to Islam or the New Religion. For the former they are discouraged as Muslims want White males women and property and White men as slaves. For the latter, the same.

            “There is a straight line from Christianity to the new religion of cuckery. Cuckery does not scale.”Are you a practicing Christian? It’s an important question.From my view, there is a complete correlation in the collapse of any sincere Christian belief Protestant/Catholic/even complete looneys to today’s cuckery in the West. We live in secular world, even in the most Christian of Western countries/areas. Most of the people I meet have heard of Christianity, whether or not they’ve ever prayed or been to a church is an open question. The churches are not empty, but the number that would need exist if 90% of population was even going through motions does not.To blame a Christianitythat few are even attempting to practiceis about deferring blame. The only solution I can offer on personal level when people look at the madness of the world is to try again with Christian belief, whatever their tradition. It’s some place to start.When people see God, they learn to have courage in this life. When all there is themselves and this life, they turn into cucks. And yes some Christians institutions agree with open borders policies because it enriches them. That’s life on planet earth. It says nothing about what a sincere Christian practice might do to encourage a sense of self worth and fearlessness.

                Modern people don’t want to engage in any sort of spiritual practice, Christianity or otherwise.Most modern people aren’t going to put in 45-60 minutes of religious practice per day, which is probably the bare minimum someone should be doing to claim they are actually practitioners of whatever spiritual system they follow. The average “Christian” I’ve met is bothered by having to commit an hour per WEEK to going to church despite claiming they believe that doing these practices is necessary for saving their soul.It isn’t surprising that the only sects that seem to be doing well at remaining Christian are the ones like the Anabaptists or the LDS that actually demand that their members practice the religion. Deseret is going to exist about 7 minutes after the collapse of Fedgov, for those commenters here who were arguing for theocracy a few weeks back.

                Christianity was anti-kin-specific altruism. It destroyed the hearth and the family. Jesus commanded us to hate our family, and let the dead bury the dead. Instead, all men are saved, all are equal, and our obligations are not to any specific people, but to all.
Which is to say, to none. And with that, you have the seeds of the radical individualism of modernity and post-modernity. Ethical obligations to everyone means you have obligations to none, particularly one’s kin andethnos.

            “The reason for the EU’s fragility is that it has been removed from the realm of reality. The foundations of its economy and competitiveness have been removed through its energy and sanctions policies, its governments and institutions are almost solely staffed by incompetents, its education system is failing, its uncontrolled immigration is unsustainable, and it is technically massively bankrupt with trillions and trillions of debt that can never be paid. No society or civilization can survive what has already happened to the EU.”The interesting part about this is that only one of these things can truly destroy a civilization and that is uncontrolled immigration. Everything else is an annoyance that results in some hardship, but would eventually self correct in the long term. Even a devastating war may not lead to the end of civilization. Only uncontrolled immigration can do that. There is a point beyond which things can not be fixed anymore. This should put priorities in order for whomever is the future dictator of EU or the post-EU states. First, remove the invaders, while also deploying the right people into positions of power and bureaucracy. Only after that is done, start working on fixing everything else.

            Good read.
The Euros could just turn away from the Ukraine like we did in Vietnam and Afghanistan – and go back to making beer and cars.  Instead they keep getting more shrill and crazy as the evitable closes in on them.

        Briggs is making a prediction about what will happen next:https://www.wmbriggs.com/post/51877/
tldr: Trump goes to jail, never-Trumpers say that “we can’t nominate a convicted felon” and Nikki Haley or Tim Scott will be nominated instead. Trump will go as independent, but may be unable to get on all the ballots in time. With Republican vote split, the Dems will be confident to not run Biden and will nominate Gavin Newsom instead.
Plausible?

            Briggs is a daily read for me now.   But I think he’s wrong here.  I don’t think they will try to switch out Biden.  Though I agree there is a good possibility the GOP cucks and sidelines Trump.
People have to understand that we are the RINOs.  The “real” GOP is embarrassed by us.  They are cowards, cucks and traitors.

                I don’t think they have ever considered switching Biden out.  Why would they?  They can do whatever they want with that retard at the helm.  Whatever is brought to the desk that is most destructive for normal White people he will sign it.  What’s the incentive for replacing him with someone with brain activity?  The election is in the bag regardless of the Trump situation, so what’s the point?

            I believe that Trump has firm enough control of the RNC to retain nomination.  He will run and win.  I don’t see the important States dumping him.  If in jail, a Constitutional crisis looms where perhaps his VP must take office.  SCOTUS must indeed get involved to the exception of all other considerations of law.However there is no path to victory without Trump on the ballot.  The Dem’s win and go into hyperdrive to destroy what’s left of resistance to their rule.in any event, this all accrues to the DR’s benefit.  The system is corrupt and prolonged dying just causes more agony for all.

Come on, man. You’re smarter than that. For God’s sake they just convicted him 34 completely bogus “felonies.” There’s no fucking way they’re going to let him win.
What the spic “judge” and the Negro “prosecutor” just did is ensure that you will be governed by Kamala Harris at some point within four years.

                    Nonsense. If Trump is on the ballot, he wins. This of course assumes a great enough vote to overcome the election fraud they’ll throw into the mix and that they can’t fix a critical number of State election laws to prohibit him as a legal candidate.The actual verdict in the case mentioned was never in doubt, was already absorbed by the populace, and can only be shown by current metrics to have enhanced Trump’s status with the people. No one was dissuaded to *not* vote for Trump who would have voted for him. Money pours in.What we see now is the behind the scenes shenanigans of attempts to get Trump off the ballot in a critical number of States. Plus, he will be jailed shorty before the formal nomination process. This is an attempt to turn the party against him and throw the nomination to another GOP candidate. If this occurs, then folks will stay home and the GOP ends as a viable alternative to the Left.It matters not to me, nor should it to any other DR’ist here in this forum. We rail against the “uniparty”, yet argue about who should win the Presidency? Might as well argue about how many angels can dance in the head of a pin.

                Although to the uninitiated it seems a useless exercise, there is some value in building castles in the air (or drawing them on the walls of one’s cell), even if it’s nothing more than stimulating one’s mind while one is locked in solitary for an indefinite term.
To Build a Castleis a truly excellent work, ranking on par with Solzhenitsyn’sGulag Archipelago.

        I’m hearing people say blacks will vote for Trump now. Idk. It would be hilarious if it takes being a convict for a Republican to finally break the Democratic stranglehold on the black vote. I hear this talk, and it’s another data point for whites becoming black imo.
My friends are also talking about a summer of Pride! riots. Again, Idk. I guess you can get away with Floyd riots because whites have a weird weakness for blacks, but I don’t think homos are as sympathetic.
Politics ain’t much fun anymore.

            There is more black and hispanic support for Trump than you might suspect. The reason is mass illegal immigration. It lowers wages for those who work because illegals get all sorts of goodies and subsidies denied even those non-White who are citizens. Their neighborhoods are colonized by masses of illegals who being mostly military aged men age 18-30 and mostly recruited criminals from Venezuelan and African prisons prey upon the non White citizens next to them. This is why the Bronx turned out for Trump.Next, taxes go up and various social welfare goodies to citizens (non White of course, no White ever qualified for government help) go down to cover the cost. Prices for diapers and doritos go up, while wages and social welfare go down.Of course, this spending is topped up by federal and state grants the like, just like homeless, who in California are worth about 750K each in combined federal, state, local, and private grants each. That is why cities compete to get illegals like the compete to get homeless. Same thing. Both drive out normal middle class people who might want oversight over grant/graft spending. The illegals also prop up declining populations in census counts and keep political representation at the state and federal level even if not expanding (rotten boroughs). Hotels and other properties with declining value get propped up as illegals are housed in hotels that both get paid full occupancy and reduce overall supply making other hotel rooms more expensive.Its a connected upper class screw over of the lower classes and they don’t like it one bit.

                I wonder though, if most blacks and Hispanics are ever exposed to an analysis like this. They’re not reading or similar blogs for the most part. Who is doing this sort of economic analysis for them? Perhaps no one is but they just sense things getting worse for them and notice the correlation with more illegals.I actually think a lot of the Trump support is just that they have sympathy for someone they see as being railroaded by the courts. I’m sure it also helps that most of the truly hysterical TDS people are fat White women, obnoxious gays, and pink haired hipsters. These are not very appealing people to *anyone* really.

            Painters-A couple positives‐By this point in 2020, we were months into the Beer Flu op and a couple weeks into the Floyd insurrection op.Domestically, there is nothing close to those in 2024. I figure that is because GAE regime competence is decaying at an exponential rate due to DIE.The current best example of that decay is the shiny new 155mm ammo plant in Mesquite, TX.The production guts of that plant had to be installed by visiting Turks from the Turkish arms firm Repkon.No need to look far for proof, this fact is reported in a NYT story from 5/29/24.

                It was all overseen by (((YKW))).
(((They))) ran the entirety of it.
On account of the transatlantic african chattel slave trade, the sephardim in Holland were amassing such massive mountains of shekels that poor Oliver Cromwell had to overturn the “Edict of Expulsion” and invite (((them))) back into England, lest Holland were to become the dominant power in Europe and England were to be reduced to a mere rump state.
The moar you delve into it, the moar you cum to realize that almost the entire history of Western Civilization is riddled with these sorts of esoteric tribal secrets.

        Yesterday was potentially a very good day if you want the system destroyed sooner rather than later *The political aspect aside, the general negative reaction appears genuine and not to have been expected. Therefore, the Regime as always either will have to start another war or astroturf a terror attack, something along those lines, and as we see, they are as retarded as they are evil and it likely will prove catastrophic as well. Even totalitarian dictatorships require a degree of domestic buy-in. There won’t be a peasant uprising obviously but some elites seem poised to bail and/or scared. The disgust appears real.*Unless it goes nuclear, which is quite possible.

            Interestingly, Biden gave Israel orders to stop the Gaza War saying it has damaged Hamas “enough.” He has also greenlit any and all attacks on Russian territory inside pre-2014 Russia including early warning radars. [Soros led organizations are calling for a “blockade” and “occupation” of the White House — circa Trump 2020.]FWIW, the Israeli Foreign minister is trolling Ireland, Spain, and Norway for recognizing Hamas. How soon will Mossad be arming and training the Irish, Spanish, and Norwegians opposed to moar mass immigration? After all the goal of Mossad now is to overthrow the entire system in those countries. The Irish are now intermittently burning down “migrant centers” … with training and encouragement they can go to burning down government ministry buildings.I will leave potential Mossad and Russian actions in response as an exercise for the reader.

            That’s a fair point. I’ve never been convinced of the Leftism-as-religion argument, either. And you’re certainly correct in noting the redistributionist aspect of Leftism, although it extends beyond “mere” wealth to include culture and history. That said, redistribution without historical dialectics and the communal telos, both of which are absent from contemporary Leftism, is basically socialism rather than Marxism. What’s more, it is quite clear that the Leftists have hijacked capitalism for their own purposes and show no inclination to jettison it now that they’re in control of the corporations. Marx and his epigoni would have no truck with such behavior.No, what we have here is postmodern relativism, which aims to eliminate the natural racial hierarchy and thereby enable redistribution in toto. Whites will be brought low and negroes will be transfigured.

                It’s not religion in a theological sense with a catechism,  it’s religion in a herd mentality sense. I spent decades in the Catholic church. I basically had it beaten into me as a kid. I agree with all its moral doctrines in opposition to homosexuality, abortion, war, etc. But I haven’t attended in years because it’s useless. Not once did I ever hear an actual sermon discussing the Church’s teaching on abortion, IVF, homosexuality, women, — nothing. All I ever heard was pure nonsensical gibberish from the pulpit.But as a Catholic, you were just supposed to instinctively know these things, as if by osmosis, because the other people you rubbed elbows with at Mass also instinctively knew these things. There was a weird subterranean herd mentality but nobody ever actually talked about shit like abortion or capital punishment or the crucifixion of Jesus or the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin or any of that. I learned more about Catholic doctrine studying Augustine and Aquinas under a Jewish philosophy professor in grad school than I ever learned in a Sunday sermon.And that’s the way the Leftist/NPC religion operates. “Good people” simply know  Trump is bad, because Trump is bad and everyone else they associate with knows Trump is bad.

                    “learned more about Catholic doctrine studying Augustine and Aquinas under a Jewish philosophy professor in grad school than I ever learned in a Sunday sermon.”Yes, I know the feeling. But take heart that most people aren’t you and don’t really care that much about the philosophy. Further, parishes have their own culture. Each one exists as a community. A different community would have talked about abortion at least, which is what the average person can wrap their head around. There really not going to be deep dives into Aquinas at most parishes.“. But I haven’t attended in years because it’s useless.”Unfortunately, the other part you didn’t probably get an education because the Catholic Church is not setup to explain almost anything is that we attend Mass for God, not the homily. Jesus is there in Eucharist. We listen to the Liturgy of the Word at Mass as God speaking to us. We practice for Heaven, by showing up at less than Heaven.It’s weekly obligation that ideally becomes a want to be with God and to learn to love God. The crap tastic homilies are just things you put ear plugs in and endure for Christ.The problem with learning about Augustine and Aquinas from a Jew is that it’s all neatly theoretical. It’s novelty and beauty to be admired from a far, but it can’t be true nor needed to be acted on. As a Catholic who has read some of this stuff, it’s not a theoretical. Both men were deeply passionate about the faith, with Augustine a bishop and Aquinas writing hymns in his “spare” time. Mass is not useless and neither is the faith, just because most people are not philosophers and never will be.

                Your last sentence is, in my opinion, the strongest evidence that whatever your wish to call our currently in vogue Leftism is, in fact a religion. Most religions, in the commonly accepted meaning of that term, promise adherents some glorious future which is usually unobtainable in the present world, and at times openly admitted as such (e.g. Christianity.) Other times the promised future will be a transformation of the present world, such as what Communism promised a New Soviet Man and that governments would fade away as no longer necessary once The Revolution was fulfilled. Now, certainly many non-religious movements, social, political, etc. fall prey to the messianic vision too. What they share in common are sets of beliefs some of which, perhaps all, are at odds with fundamental laws of reality. As such, a skeptic would conclude there’s little chance of such plans coming to fruition, ever.

            At this point, I’d rather call it Envyism instead of a forever mutated-revised-stretched Marxism.  Like Spandrell’s Bioleninism says:  they hate themselves for being mediocre and maladaptive and they hate us ’cause they ain’t us.  They want to get their grubby hands on someone else’s stuff, and call it a moral imperative.
Marx and Engels just put a name and codification of something recurrent and fundamental:  Green green Envy.10th commandment.

            The GAE’s fixation on its Ukraine/Russia project, and Trump’s unwillingness to go along with it, is the only reason I’ve been able to come up with that they weren’t willing to co-opt his presidency for x number of years, rather than go to all the trouble they’ve gone to to be rid of him. The Ukraine/Russia thing, for some reason, is just that important to them. Even though you don’t need a president’s permission for much, you still need it to fight a war with Russia, if you want to keep up appearances anyway.

I think I know what you meant, but technically war powers are in the domain of Congress.  The President can (legally) only use military authority in a limited manner with restrictions as to when and how long. We seem to already be in violation of that proscription with US troops disguised as civilian contractors in Ukraine, as well as intelligence sharing with Ukraine in targeting Russian assets.This of course has been abused and Congress weak in asserting its authority since getting a backbone after the Vietnam debacle.  Of course, power abhors a vacuum. A President can walk us into a conflict and afterwards get Congress to retrofit a “blessing” on the matter to save face.

        “… the right to be free from discrimination.” By that standard the anti-white regime is illegitimate.If we can even win the debate, which I don’t think we can, how long will it take to win it? What will be left that isn’t destroyed by that time? Will there be enough left to rebuild, and how much and how well can we rebuild?In other words, is the risk of continuing with debating and losing or winning but there being nothing left to plant the flag of victory in, worth those costs versus some other tactic. I am not proposing violence. I am proposing posing those questions and saying what we are debating and proposing is the wrong thing.We should be discussing Peaceful Separation. If anything, that will unveil the mask of those trying to make individuals free from discrimination. In this system we are discriminated against. You get your place with your system, we get ours. The same is true of reparations. Every call for reparations should be met with a call to a negotiation where the deal on the table is – you get your payment under these terms but we part ways for eternity. We must call their bluff. It is all bluff. The hour is late.

            “We should be discussing Peaceful Separation.”
What in God’s good name makes you believe they would allow this?  We cannot even have the peace of being left alone and you think they are just going to allow us to take over part of the US as our country?  If we’re going to “fight” for this peaceful separation, why not fight for everything?
I have no idea what future awaits us.  But the one future I know ain’t gonna happen is that we “peacefully” separate from the GAE and start our own country.

                You may have missed my point that I thought I made clearly. Let me restate it. You bring peaceful separation to the table as an entirely new point of discussion. The point of doing that is when they refuse peaceful separation they admit they are interested in conquest. You and I know that is what they want. However, unhealthy-delusional (what “normie” really is), is not clear on that. Once he sees the perfectly reasonable and well expressed idea of ending the conflicts by peacefully separating rejected out of hand while a demand is made to make him pay for crimes neither he nor his ancestors nor his children committed there is a chance he will awaken. This isn’t about negotiating with The Regime. It is a rhetorical tactic that gives you a better chance to throw cold water on the deluded.Otherwise, that huge number of our people just continue to sit around and say, “Those dummies don’t understand negative rights.” It has to be tried.Now, if you have a better idea bring it to the table. I’m all ears.

        Unfortunately this isn’t a “new” religion.  This is simply the existing religion intensified.  The way it works is that the core values of a society get doubled down on over time as a ratchet effect until it either results in genocide, civilizational suicide, or conquest from external enemies.  In the West’s case the core value is egalitarianism, which is derived from Christianity.  I discuss the egalitarian ratchet effecthere, but basically everything must become *more* “equal” over time as part of the Whig theory of history as progress from a dark past to a glorious future.  It is rapidly heading toward total white erasure.As wonderful historian Tom Holland argued, “Fascism, I think, was the most radical revolutionary movement that Europe has seen since the age of Constantine. Because unlike the French Revolution, unlike the Russian Revolution, it doesn’t even target institutional Christianity: it targets the moral/ethical fundamentals of Christianity. The French Revolution, the Russian Revolution are still preaching the idea that the victim should be raised up from the dust and that the oppressor should be humbled into the dust; it’s still preaching the idea that the first should be last and the last should be first just as Christ has done….Atheists of today [like Richard Dawkins et al]… they are basically Christians.Nietzsche saw humanists, communists, liberals—people who may define themselves against Christianity—as being absolutely in the fundamentals Christian, and I think he is right about that because I think that in a sense atheism doesn’t repudiate the kind of ethics and the morals and the values of Christianity.“Ultimately there *must* be a transvaluation of society’s core values away from egalitarianism or else the egalitarian ratchet effect will continue to intensify until the West completely implodes and whites disappear from the planet.  Such a transvaluation can either be a complete one (as was tried in the last great war) or (my preferred preference) a partial one balancing egalitarianism and inegalitarianism, where the latter is accepted for its own sake and not seen as bad or “evil”.

                NF wrote thatIn the West’s case the core value is egalitarianism, which is derived from Christianity.NF is incorrect on this point. The core value is egoism, which was elevated to a supreme principle of existence by Israel. SeeShemot (Names) 3:14for a critical verse expressing Israel’s perverse notion about the supremacy of self and willpower.The Nazi religion of the torahs—which was the religion of Jesus—is far from egalitarian except maybe for the children of Israel on one tier and eveyone else below them on one or more tiers. The Christianities however, while retaining that egoism and willpower fetish, replace Israel’s exclusive supremacism in favor of a semi-inclusive supremacism in which there is neither Greek nor Jew, so to speak.All the faithful are to be one in a mystical body of the alleged Christ, and as in the predecessor cult, each human is supposed to be an appearance of the divine, making them equal in this respect at the very least. The old exclusive Israel is superceded by the new inclusive Israel of those faithful to the alleged Christ.Now, the Christianities may well have been conceived by Saul of Tarsus or others to subvert the hated Romans, or the original heresey was adapted for this purpose. Neverthless, Christian flirtation with unqualified egalitarianism is too obvious to deny intelligently. The “stupid canard”, as you call it, is a duck which can fly and evade your hateful pot shots at it.

                    The modern religion of Judaism was not the religion of Jesus, the Creator of the religion of the ancient Israelites. Your analysis shows very little familiarity with either the New or Old Testament. Taken on it’s ending, God’s Chosen people were chosen to produce Christ, the light for all nations. Even at the pre-Christ height of “choosiness&#x27;” it mostly meant being given no excuses to worship idols before God.Yes, there is an egalitarianism in Christianity. We can all be saved and we all have an equal dignity before God. Beyond that it’s the Kingdom of God. Christians are to think of themselves as servants. Plenty of heirarchy that even most modern Christians are uncomfortable.

                Greatly disagree. Christianity in today’s most widely accepted sense is under the strain of dichotomy.
It provides the strength of natural hierarchy, but the quality of mercy- in that we are all in the same boat- has been stretched into a weapon against the very people who made Christianity their flag, who shaped it into what it is.
(Try as you will, Dasein, never will I submit to your yhwh.  You might as well tell me that we should all just recite the shahada together.)

                ID.  Probably correct, but an understandable error.  Google “Jesus teachings on ‘equality’ “and you’ll see a raft of information and quotations appear.  However read them and you’ll see they refer to equality under law or under God, spiritual equality, not equality of men among each other with respect to each other.  If there will ever be “equity”, it is promised only after death.  How would/could it be otherwise in an ancient world of slaves, bondsmen, Kings and peasants?
Hell, we still don’t have many folk understanding the DoI statement:  …all men are created equal…

            ‘everything must become *more* “equal” over time as part of the Whig theory of history as progress from a dark past to a glorious future’If your theory is correct, then when should I expect to see a demand that squat aztecs be equally represented in the NBA?When should I expect the demand that men be equally represented in colleges?Your theory doesn’t include “Who, Whom.”  Demands for equality are weapons that specific groups employ against their enemies.  Almost no one believes in equality as a universal, which is what I understand your theory to say is the primary motivation.

        in the 2014-19 TV show “Gotham” there was a bit where Carol Kane, playing a ditzy/murderous Eastern European immigrant and mother of Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin, recounts how “teacher had teacher’s pet, prettiest girl who was having affair with teacher. I could never get anywhere.” Pause. “So I informed on teacher and girl to secret police they were capitalist wreckers. Both were shot immediately. And new teacher gave me top grades!”That is the process, more or less, that runs in our society based on rights of non-Whites to you, your stuff, and your everything. It works when the Secret Police and the informers are all the same ethnicity. It is telling that the Soviet system came up against ethnic/racial resistance massively over decades in the Caucuses, and in Central Asia.We are starting to see that here. Disney / Lucasfilm is rolling out the same old “you bigots better see the black lesbian Star Wars or we will call you racists” and finding that the 2012 playbook no longer works. Its starting with entertainment, but it won’t end there. They know that too.

        In sum, somebody opened the gates, and now demands that we serve them and their army.By what authority?By an appeal to authority.  By an assumption of authority.An appeal to authority is what makes up any religion or type of religion.*Authority then sets a pecking order.The pecking order, then, is the morality.Morality, after all, is how we treat one another; how we treat one another is how we feel about one another.  About this one, about that one, about this bunch here or about that bunch over there.That authority can be internalized, or it can be enforced.Acceptance or resistance to that authority defines the group, which defines the pecking order, which defines loyalties, which defines behavior…one’s moral boundaries.The moral diktats we follow, allow, or accept are an extension, then, of identity and loyalties, and the ladder those loyalties climb.That ladder will lead to…an authority.  The alpha flagpole around which we arrange our selves and status according to nearness or farness.  Our flagpole is simply the means by which groups of individuals organize themselves.Authority is determined by the ladder.The ladder expresses itself as morality.The morality is defined by our loyalties.Oue loyalties define our identity.  The Who we are.How to open the gates and realign the ladder?How to conquer without war?First, seize the flagpole.Declare oneself to be the alpha, the authority and definer of authority.Such a dominance display might be based on might, or merit, or by fiat- by assuming the sale.  By simply telling everyone “we were First.”  Needing order above all, a high-trust society will say, “well, somebody’s got to be first. This bunch seems okay.”(This bunch of self-declared experts, or representatives, or divinely ordained, or well-intentioned, or brave underdogs, or whoever.)Those who opened the gates conquered by redefining authority, loyalty, identity, and morality.They redefined Who We Are…and now, we must kneel, and quarter their troops.To defend our old Selves is not only increasingly illegal, but worse…it is immoral.Why do we believe? Why does belief come before reason?Because belief, is identity.  Whose Tree do you belong to?Who is your authority, that gives you your authority?————————————————*An appeal to authority is what makes up any religion or type of religion.That authority can be, or be nested subsets of:an entity: a god, or a King of the godsa founder or face of a people, a Fathera Source (the subliminated instinct of King and Father to claim unimpeachable authority)a race or nation, a bunda brotherhood or sisterhood, a sexan organization of like profession, like minds, or paya set of Laws, to the what is, such as the laws of physics (that is my own religion)Submission to authority asks, “Is it best for me or mine?”This is not selfishness.  This is asking, “Why am I here?  To whom do I belong?”

        i have to admit that i’m never called myself a “constitutional conservative” or anything like that. My view is this – you can’t have a two party system with a federalist system.What will inevitably happen is that you will have various state legislatures that will merely mirror the same dysfunction of congress and national issues will become local issues. Federalism will end up being like foreign policy where you have blocs fighting it out (i.e. europe with an eastern and western bloc).If there were different political parties at the state level, it might make things more interesting and less polarized. So in a republican state like Oklahoma – you would have two different parties at the local level to try to make things more competitive, same thing in a democratic party stronghold like California.This is a little bit hard to explain, but does anyone here get my drift?

            Ultimately it is the people who matter and not the system. This is the reality behind the drive to replace Western populations. The Trump show trial along with all other recent outrages simply reflects the Third World population becoming dominant in the United States.
Constitutional or federal or whatever, a nation is only as good as its people and the importation of human garbage results in what we see now.

        I’m a little surprised how few people see what’s going on. Professional people don’t act this way in real life, especially under the magnifying glass of television. It’s a movie/psyop, but the lesson being taught is in question. I’ve got a few possibilities.1. A mass lesson in “We were just following orders,” the lesson being that it could happen here, too.2. Specific people selected because they are so corrupt or compromised that they will do anything you tell them to do. Just to hammer home how much corruption there is in government these days.3. Showing people what the Jeffrey Epstein video tapes, collected courtesy of our greatest ally, we’re being used for.This is not real. Our country hasn’t fallen to those depths yet. It is not a banana republic. It could fall to those levels, but it hasn’t it is nowhere near that.

                    Nick–I think you are on to something.Yes, I will make an extension to what you say: the strings on this movie are being pulled by someone else.BUT– America is pretty much “AINO” which stands for “America in Name Only.”
Have a look at a guy’s blog called AnonymousConservative[dot]comand see what you think about the American Stasi
i do think Trump is “in on” this movie. He, too, is taking orders from someone(s) very high up.Kuh-ball. (Written phonetically.)

            TempoNick: “Specific peopleselectedbecause they are so corrupt or compromised that they will do anything you tell them to do.”Key in on that aspect of your analysis – the selection process.EVERYONE in Washington DC was chosen via an exceptionally rigorous sorting of their personalititties, and grueling examinations of their psychologicaloleaginousness, to determine their ultimate obsequiousness.[Off the top of muh head, the only two counterexamples I might think of would be Rand Paul &amp; especially Thomas Massie, both hailing from the great state of Kentucky. Go figure.]Hopefully it goes without saying that these personalititty types are all card-carrying true-believing lifetime-members of the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex.On its own turf, and on its own terms, thePassive Aggressive Industrial Complex is simply omnipotent.That’s why God created us peasants, and why He armed us with torches &amp; pitchforks &amp; scythes.Because every few centuries, the manors of the landlords must be burnt to the ground.

        I’m glad justice has been served. Attempts to impeach Biden fizzled out spectacularly.
Absolutely stabilizing with the affirmation that no man is above the law.Reinforces our faith in a system that weve been told noone is a King and even Presidents are subject to constitutional constraints and need to obey the laws of the land before, during and after their terms.Its about time this snake has been held accountable. Im so proud of that jury!

                            There’s a bish at the old Memphis State [now “Universititty of Memphis”] who’s wandering around, hiding tiny ducks on campus.


Those are kinda weird camera angles; they make her hips &amp; her waste look rather “wide angle”, and she’s definitely wearing black lipstick.
Hopefully that black lipstick doesn’t mean she’s a filthy stinking mμdsh@rk.
If she’s legit NOT amμdsh@rk,then at closing time, she might be good for a Bee Jay [no teeth, of course].

                Point I’ve made repeatedly, again must be made. Trolls destroy comment sections. Soon there will be more of TD’s friends. Indeed, doubtful this TD is the original one of long past, but a lurker who has now found a moniker to incite some of the old-timers in this blog.  An in your face type of thing.
You tolerate these people at your own risk and of course, replying to them is a fruitless pursuit and counter productive.
