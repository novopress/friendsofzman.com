        The proper way to understand Jesus is not as some kind of global open-borders communist, but as a critic of the Jewish Pharisees and the Jewish power structure who called them out on their hypocrisy, duplicity, and grift in Matthew 23.They “tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.”“Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues;they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.”But they were ripping off the people with their temple-coin scam. They refused to help a robbery victim bleeding in the ditch and it fell to a Samaritan goy to do it.Christians have always helped others by volunteering to be missionaries in impoverished Third World countries, not by inviting them into their own countries.The Pharisees in our own Jewish-controlled government are trying to entrap the followers of Christ with egalitarian bullshit for their own self-serving purposes.They sure as hell didn’t bring 20,000 cat-eating Haitians into Martha’s Vineyard, or Harvard Yard…

            That’s the crux of the matter, isn’t it?They “tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.”
Essentially no one in support of these feel-good maneuvers will ever feel the impact of what they’ve wrought.  To his dying day Mike DeWine will live in luxury, never once dealing with having a soiled mattress shied onto his lawn or watching his next door neighbor grieve for the child killed by a recklessly driving immigrant.  It’s all theoretical to him.

                Name names and shame. These NGOs have leaders. Paste their names, addresses, telephone numbers, emails, HQ information. Let people in Springfield, OH ask John Q. Goodperson, CEO of Goodperson NGO why they have to deal with all these migrants.

                    Also, identify the people employing immigrants as cheap docile labor while deriding their own countrymen as lazy drug addicted scum who deserve their replacement.

                    It’s already come out that the mayor of Springfield is operating a slumlord business renting out to these people. Probably 20 to a room. He gets paid, he doesn’t care, just like the factory owner they interviewed, he has no loyalty to the town or its people. In fact, he probably loathes them and sees them as backwards drug addicted losers holding him back from his true calling as an apparatchik for ActBlue or Conservative Inc. (I don’t know which party he is a member of, it does not matter).

                    Yes. This is exactly the path forward. The cat meme and the other memes of, “owning”, while clever are fine but they do not go far enough.The next generation of meme warfare is outright naming the criminals. This is at the local, national and global level. This is true of the invasion and all of the forms of anarcho-tyranny.The money networks need to be rooted out and payment transfers exposed. Then every hotelier, landlord, city/county councilman/woman/zher, state and federal official need to be named and shamed. This has to happen in both digital and physical space. The townsman of Springfield and the other locales and the ones who Mayorkas already has targeted for invasion are going to have to be relentless – posting signs …These townspeople and townspeople everywhere are fighting a ticking clock. They must stop going to city council meetings where they will be gaveled down and ignored. They must use their current majority to become the city council. Now, this is going to get interesting, because once they are in the council seat, they are going to be tempted with the same bribes and ticket taking inducements. If smart they can take the money but route it to their constituents – fellow Americans who can get the money and use it how they please.This is war. Not only should those signs be posted the locals should also agitate the pets. At some point the pets should be turned against their masters if and when possible by ruthless propaganda. They have sewn the seeds of resentment. Can those forces be channeled against them. Perhaps a strategy is to join the invaders in demanding equal services and payouts.The one thing this regime has as a problem is the sheer surface area they have to cover. Regular open protests, demonstrations and peaceful agitation is on the docket. Otherwise we quietly fade into an impotent minority without any resistance.This will invite resistance and it will invite harsh repression. Is the Historic American Nation up to the task. Right now waving the flag, MAGA swag and giant rallies are consuming the energy and they are relatively painless exercises.The age of symbolic patriotism and patriotism itself is over. It ended a long time ago for every tribe but one. If that one tribe is up for becoming tribal, it has everything it needs to be the dominant one. It is going to have to become ruthless and prize the principal of tribe and tribal power over personal and abstract principal. This is what the system fears. This is why it is in a full court press to bury the HAN both demographically and throughout the judiciary branch so by vote and legal recourse they are rendered impotent.Time is running out.

                        People can’t afford to live where they grew up. It’s already game over at that point. Locally, it’s realtors and refugees from NYC burbs buying everything, often paying cash. Yep, it’s getting diverse, like foreign language diverse, and it’s public money propping up the real estate scam.Pretty much only farms zoned ag (farms near towns zoned otherwise but grandfathered) and houses in their midst are staying in local hands, as far as I can tell. Anything close to a town, good luck. Somehow plain Dutch are winning again and will end up with the place in the long run, I’d guess.But muh house is worth 7X what I paid 40 years ago, so I win, capitalism wins, suck on it you commie snowflakes!

                    Plus, their names and addresses will come in handy after we win and have the American version of Auschwitz built and ready to take in the first guests.
Even if we don’t win, but the tide turns, these same people will be out there saying “I dindu nuffin! I always agreed with you!”

            Great post Xman.
let this be a lesson to everyone who advocates for “peaceful separation”.  They won’t let you separate.  This is what they will do.  There is nowhere to go.  They will not allow you to be away from it.

                Since I got involved in immigration restriction 20 years ago, I have heard from Christians that the Tower of Babel is the scriptural refutation of open borders.
Why has this refutation been so totally ineffective in changing the minds of most Christians?
(My explanation is that the owners of the media literally program the minds and morals of most people, including Christians. Even most intelligent people are not independent thinkers and affluence is like a sedative.)

                    “Why has this refutation been so totally ineffective in changing the minds of most Christians?”The quibble is that Babel wasn’t about immigration. God ordered the peoples of the time to spread out and inhabit the Earth; instead, they centralized and built a monument to self-apotheosis. Which are the same ultimate goals as the One-Worlders pushing the immivasion, hence it being only a quibble.God created the various races and nations of Man. Deliberately miscegenating them, therefore, is rebellion against God. That’s why it’s evil. The LGBT movement is the same crime: God made us male and female, so the devil’s servants want to make us anything but that. No history lesson needed.The real reason is simply that most “Christians” don’t know what Christianity is, and they quietly don’t want to know. Christian morality begins with Eve rebelling against male authority, and Adam submitting in response. That is how humanity fell from perfection. Until that teaching is accepted, teachings about the subsequent sins of Sodom and Babel are hopeless. Like doing algebra while denying arithmetic.Everything comes back to Woman rebelled, Man simped. The servant seized authority over the master. Example here, modern Christians think nationalism is about having babies (female agenda of family) rather than patriarchy (the male agenda of well-ordered, responsible society). That’s backwards. No society, homogenous or not, will survive or prosper so long as women are in authority over men, so merely upping the birth rate is useless. It is ordinary men running society that creates nations, not women having babies.Men allowed to associate with similar men.Presto, nations.But only when men rule over women.

                    When I was a kid, you could probably make a good case. Other than the periodicals section of the library, your only news was the local paper(s) and a handful of stations/affiliates. A better case could be made that schools played the dominant role in shaping opinion and even ability to think.
By the mid-Zoomers, not plausible. They platform-hopped as their parents and grandparents tried to keep up. Z became influenced by whomever on places like SnapChat or TikTok, which, whatever one thinks of them, are probably not Zionist controlled.

                        Thanks, Steve.  I had a counter reply to you, but instead I’ll just reflect on your post instead.
As I said in another message, so much of what we do here is speculate about the motives of forces vastly more powerful and inscrutable than we are.  People of good faith may differ about the shadows on the cave wall.

                            Despite my cynical face, this recent explosion in ability to communicate makes me wildly optimistic. Zoomers and Alphas have so many more options than I did. Not just in “news” and “views” but also in opportunities. If you wanted to be a musician as recently as the ’80s and into the ’90s, your options were limited to signing with a label (and get utterly screwed) or blowing well over a half million on a bare bones recording studio. Now? Got a laptop or desktop? Headphones or earbuds? Obviously you already have an instrument. Drop $100 for a Focusrite Scarlett or Presonus StudioBox or $80 for the Behringer, $100 for an SM-58 (a third that for an acceptable clone), download free Reaper software, and you are limited only by your musical ability and marketing skills. And there are people on YouTube who for free explain how you can do all this yourself.Or graphic arts. Or publishing. Or film making. Or writing books. Light shows. DJ gigs. App development. Making computer games. And, of course, web design or “social media influencer” or “podcaster” wasn’t even imaginable. The creative boom will be amazing.The problems we hand them are almost exclusively political in nature. There are a rough 5-10 years ahead, because politics involves men with guns enforcing the diktats of authoritarians. I don’t know that we can untangle these issues for our kids. It’s fiendishly difficult to persuade people to release the political beliefs of their early adulthood, largely because in the last few decades, they got merged into moral beliefs.But once through that? Hope your kids and grandkids have the education to make you proud.

                Yes, God hates globalism.  He confused the languages, divided mankind, and scattered them to the far corners of the earth.“Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.”  Genesis 11:9God has established the legitimate authority of human government and national borders.“When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.”  Deuteronomy 32:8This divine appointment is repeated in the New Testament.“And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation”  Acts 17:26

        If dumping 20,000 low IQ, zero skilled Haitians into a town of 40,000 blue collar white Americans is “Christianity” (it’s not) I want nothing to do with it.
It’s a raw and naked grab at permanent power, but ultimately, a death cult.
I don’t think anyone knows how to stop it, much less reverse it.
Especially evil because it destroys the notion of a “parallel society/parallel institution.”
”Nice parallel you have there. Shame if someone dumped infinite human refuse on it.”

            I think there’s a method to his madness. The same pattern keeps repeating itself over and over again. Trump says something everybody thinks is outrageous and soon enough, the media has to admit he was right about it. (The New York Times admitted his numbers are correct.)
Could he be goading the Democrats to ramp up cheating so that he can catch them in a relatively safe pro-Trump state? Ohio has clean elections or at least that’s what everybody thinks. What if we don’t really have clean elections?

                        TempoNick, you are an interesting case. We are all speculating about the motives of the elites, whose intentions are not accessible to us.
You, like Derb and Jared, still give the benefit of the doubt to the elites. “He has a son and daughter in politics” and “Cheating hurts his kids and their prospects.”
People like me hold your position for some amount of time, until persistent frustration radicalizes us. But some, like Derb and Jared, uphold the possible legitimacy of the system indefinately.
It’s psychology, not logic.  It’s a judgment call.

                            DeWine is a decent guy. Maybe he’s a crook, maybe he isn’t, but if he is a crook, it’s going to be small potatoes. Lifelong resident, still owns a farm, two kids lawyers and involved in politics. As one person said on another board, “he’s one step short of being a RINO,” but I don’t think he’s a bad guy. That’s completely different from all these Gordon Gekko and neocon types who seem to have dominated Republican thinking since Reagan.DeRino has been a good public servant overall even if he rubs me the wrong way sometimes.

            Public/government control is not the only possible parallel structure.
Our lawyers say that while it hasn’t been rigorously tested yet our only answer is Chapter 9. While that’s just a reorganization bankruptcy, if there is no hope, it gets shifted into liquidation bankruptcy.
Yes, the storm troopers could overrule things, but that’s always been the case. Just ask LaVoy Finicum. But without public shelters, either the Sheriff would have to enforce vagrancy laws or the health department would have to roll in.

        I’m not religious, but any semblance between modern Western Christianity and the faith of even less than a century ago is purely coincidental at this point. Much like how the Soviets co-opted the Orthodox Church and turned it into an organ of the state, the totalitarians who run the West have done much the same. The United States and its satrapies are pure, unadulterated evil at this point (I believe evil to be quite real despite my lack of faith). It would be enough to make someone go to a real church if one still existed.

            Yes. The Left, and their money, have been very effective in corrupting most churches, and that includes the “evangelical” ones, far beyond the Christian Zionist stuff which is bad enough. This has been well-documented, including the LGBT subversion of formerly conservative churches.“The Church” still exists as a force for good, but outside any denomination.Regarding evil, Tucker Carlson had a good discussion recently about how so much of the policies of Our Betters are just plain anti-human, and thus evil, including the recent drive to enable Ukraine with the ability to strike Russia with missiles, increasing the likelihood of nuclear war. These things are outside of rationality, and readers here could compile a long list of such anti-human policies that are being pushed.

            “I believe evil to be quite real despite my lack of faith.”
Jack, I guess that we have similar agnostic outlooks, although you may impugn to “evil” more ontological weight than me.
Without a spiritual anchor, how do you define “evil?” After all, in a godless universe, the events of humankind simply redound to benefit one group over another. How, in all that, do you define “evil?”
I’m not razzing you. I am sincerely curious.
(In my view, when people use the word “evil,” they simply mean existential threats to the people that they care about.)

            Agree.  Although I think the reason or why behind the principle is that obliteration of separate nations of peoples will lead to unfathomable levels of tyranny (One World Government says hello).  A multipolar world seems preferable.
As is often the case, God has to save us from ourselves.

        For me, what Jesus would or would not think about modern AINO politics is irrelevant. Jesus don’t live here in Clown World. I do. I don’t have to justify to the lizard sitting in the  Vatican, or the Protestant heretics, a damn thing. They’ve abrogated moral authority long ago, so arguing with them about WWJD is an exercise in futility. When they start their political sophism about “Scripture” the best response is to tell them that you simply don’t recognize their moral authority over free men, because they ain’t Jesus.

            I can’t envision a way that a great prophet would emerge and effectively challenge TPTB.  Though Jesus emerged just before the height of the Roman Empire so God knows what He’s doing.
My guess is that he may be walking the earth now. Spreading the seeds as it were. Or else he has already appeared, and we won’t know it until decades later. (David Koresh?)

                We have had plenty of them (though not in a conventionally religious category) and they usually meet the same fate as the religious prophets.  Ted K. (not the politician), the Austrian Painter.  Some were a little luckier on their Earthly sojourn, but have been pilloried posthumously: Henry the Auto Maker, the Guy Who Flew the Plane, Joe Sobran.  Some are still with us and have been banished from polite society: Pat Buchanan, many Twitter (stupidly renamed X) casualties.They have challenged TPTB in ways similar to the Sand Joggers.  With very little cost, they have caused TPTB to expend vast resources to counter them.  Like the little mountain spring that carves a valley (hope it doesn’t take as long).

        “If we wanted to help Haiti, there are ways we could improve the conditions on the island without harming cat owners in Ohio.”What for? Am I my brother’s keeper? Not that I would ever think of a Haitian as a brother. The attempts to improve their local cousins in the USA has been an abysmal failure and very expensive to boot. It can’t be done. Genetics. Sub-Saharan Africans are a biological dead-end. What we know is that earlier biological dead-ends — cousins of homo sapiens — came to an end. They couldn’t adapt and survive (this will probably happen to us as well eventually but that’s another story).This crazy notion that we’re all “God’s chillun” has to come to an end. We are different racially, They didn’t know about genes and DNA back in them thar days. Though even Ibn Khaldun, writing in the early 14th century, maintains that “negroes are generally light-headed, reckless and prompt to mirth, fond of every kind of dancing, and everywhere renowned for their stupidity.”

                And along those lines, it’s interesting how so much of earlier anthropology, which was condemned as “racist,” has been confirmed by recent DNA research.
Those European and American scholars, before the Age of Franz Boas, were pretty truthful, not only about racial differences, but also about things like the Indo-European expansion.

            They knew pretty well about breeding. So they might not have known as much about the specific mechanics of DNA to the extent we know (or at least think we know) now.  But they were able to observe offspring and inherited behavior, and how things scale up.  And they were less inhibited from “noticing”.

        I perceive the recent fate of Springfield a little differently.
It is an act of war.
Thebureaucratic-managerial class has launched human WMDs on one small town representation of their perceived mortal enemy: America’s residual bourgeoisie class, AKA the dreaded “deplorables”.
The deplorables aren’t self-aware enough (as a class) – yet – to recognize they are already engaged in a war.
What has long been a culture war is now being ratcheted up a notch with kinetics, now that their religious and moral woke-olian justifications have been laid over the past decades.

        Funny how certain people are allowed to have ethnic, racial and religious nations, but others are not, and the ones who are not are always White.The language of the Bible is steeped in talk of nations. It is one of those fundamental concepts that is rarely praised* or condemned, but is just so natural that it doesn’t require explicit mention very often any more than it needs to be said that “God loves the sky,” or “God loves trees.”We have a right to our nation, and the nation isn’t merely our piece of magic dirt, though that is a part it. It is our people, formed through centuries of shared heritage, descendance and history, and the land we have conquered for ourselves.*There are exceptions, for example where it is said that the nations are ordained by God, the leaders of nations serve by God’s will, etc. Apologies for being too lazy to look up chapter and verse this morning.

                More specifically, rights only have meaning in a society committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes. They would work fine with a sufficiently narrow definition of “white”.
Germany and France have been at odds forever. A society which tried to impose both French and German sensibilities onto a populace would be less prone to being able to form a civil society than if they were separated.

                    While I agree with the sentiment, I really, really hate that “nation of laws” thing the “conservatives” do.
What they mean by “laws” is “legislation”, which is of man. “Law” is like gravity or inertia — you couldn’t change it if you wanted to, let alone getting a majority of CongressCritters to agree, and a President to sign.
We are, but were not intended to be a nation of legislation.

        Nowhere in the Bible does it say that we need to impoverish and destroy ourselves in order to accommodate all these different people. Jesus told his apostles to spread his Word, and to do so, the apostles and the rest of his followers had to go to other countries and meet them where they were. This meant speaking the local language, understanding their way of life, convincing them of the truth of His message. Not telling them to pack up and move far away into some strange land. Also, it needs to be said, these people are not Christians. They worship demons and sacrifice animals to their demon gods and practice blood magic rituals. We have no responsibility to demon worshippers except to convert them and give up their ways. We have no responsibility to let them in our homes where they can bring their evil spirits and demonic possessions into them. They need to stay far, far away.

            A good follow up to this would be reading a few articles on this by Michael Yon. For those who aren’t familiar with him, he’s former 3rd SF (I could be wrong about the particular Group, but I know he’s SF) and has been a war correspondent and photographer for the last twenty years.His latest piece on the goings on in OH; “Wait until small children begin disappearing. No one in this country has any idea how common cannibalism is in many areas of the world. What is worse, no one here – especially the politicians will have any idea how to deal with it once it rears it’s stone-age head.”

        When Jesus ignored a woman from an outgroup, saying that it was wrong to take the food of children and give it to the dogs, he was explicitly ethnocentric. Because of her exemplary faith, he made an exception. Good rule of thumb.
Also, His mission was to his own people, and His mission only spread out to the other nations once His work among His own people was done. Also good rule of thumb.
Does throwing random Haitians into a small town sound like it fits here? Obviously not.

                Seriously? If one of your family were dying of cancer, and you ignored an insult and asked again for healing, you would call that “begging”? Or that your family member being healed was “scraps”?

        Generally, I prefer the Nicomachean ethics to the Christian. I agree with Machiavelli that the teachings of Jesus are fine for personal interactions (at least with people who share the same reciprocal precepts), but provide a poor model for statecraft. Jesus, like Nietzsche, was unconcerned with politics.
Christian morals, like the laws, are weaponized by the “left” against traditional society and Heritage populations. They know what they are doing. The only way to refute them is to reject their premises, and proceed from a code based not on morals, but interest, tempered by honor rather than compassion.

            Excellent comment.  He was preaching to the individual when he said give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and give to God what is God’s.  He told individuals to care for the poor.

                Right. Jesus taught individuals how to transcend the corruption of ancient Judea and the Pharisaical power structure. He wasn’t advocating for a specific government policy, he was calling out those in power as liars, cheats and hypocrites ripping off the poor, average schlubs:
“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!  …(O)n the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness….
…You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?”

        Mycale said it well, and I will try to add to his comment. The Bible is not a suicide pact.And Z is correct. Jesus would hate the asshats (the formal church’s), that finance the invasion of the country.I had to leave mine over such insanity.Finally, I think Jesus would be doing a lot of face palming if he were here today. “People, people, that’s not what I said/meant”.On a side note, the alphabet groups tried again, and failed again to put down orange man bad. Thing is, they only have to succeed once.And if at first you don’t succeed….

Whether it’s a liberal politician looking for a mandate for socialism in the Constitution or a liberal preacher looking for it in the Bible, none of these guys care whatanyoneactually meant by anything they wrote or said. It’s all just a smokescreen for women and mush minded men to justify what they already want to do.

Sabbath — never mind.

Thou shalt not kill. Except in Gaza or Ukraine. Or at Planned Parenthood. Pretty sure those exceptions are in there.

        Anytime somebody tries to use Christianity on me I just laugh, “Well bless your heart.  Look at you conveniently choosing Christ when you think it’s politically expedient to do so.”
We left our last Catholic parish in late 2000 when the priest invited some satanic Al Gore “guest speaker” to lecture the congregation about why we should overlook abortion and vote for Gore.  She even had one of those rainbow colored berets.  We never went back to mass at that church.  I almost got up and walked out.

                We finally gave up on ’em during COVID.
I told the pastor it was wrong to shut down church just because govt said so, that I could set up a radio transmitter to broadcast service, certainly over the parking lot. Grudgingly got permission, even though it didn’t cost them a penny.
On Good Friday, I walked in to tell the pastor the batteries on his mike were dying, and entered the sanctuary, seeing everyone wearing the Codpieces of St. Fauci, and at that moment, they all intoned, “We have no king but Caesar.”
It was a sign.

        Trump missed an enormous opportunity when he started talking about the cat-eating Haitians. You’ve now gotten the population focused on “Are the Haitians eating cats?” With both sides arguing about that question. This is what’s being talked anbout instead of the main problem, the fact that migrants are ruining your neighborhoods. He should have stated it much simpler in the form of a question. Are your neighborhoods better or worse with these migrants? Do you feel safer walking downtown in Minneapolis or Springfield, OH now than you did 30 years ago? Are they making schools better or worse? Is there more or less graffiti and blight? The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.

            I tend to disagree – just another minority invasion would not have gotten as much attention.  But eating your PETS!  Now that it has AINO’s attention – the rest of the points (is it safer, are schools better, etc.) will naturally come up.

        Its really silly when people argue that anyone who behaves in an extremely degenerate &amp; savage manner with no remorse, no acknowledgement that their behavior is antisocial &amp; destructive are fine just in general. It gets even more ridiculous when people claim people like that are the same as others of a given faith that explicitly disavows such behavior.Same goes for the denial of pattern recognition, its like claiming poker is exactly the same as blackjack. How many famous blackjack players are there who are renowned for their skill at the game? There isn’t because poker isn’t random chance &amp; nobody makes such a claim but when it comes to humans suddenly you have to pretend that famous poker players are just extremely lucky beyond all reason- its just as absurd of a claim.With the haitians though there’s not even a smidgen of logic or theological reasoning, at least with the the other examples there’s scripture to deliberately twist &amp; lie by omission about but haitians? These are savages that make islamic somalians look good in comparison &amp; they not only lack any remote connection to the faith of those importing them (at least muslims recognize Jesus as a prophet, it’s utterly frivolous but itssomething) these are explicitly anti Christian pagans who invented a religion designed from the ground up to be the antithesis of Christianity on the grounds its a White religion with a White god.Not only are the subhumans who are making money hand over fist for betraying their civilization, country, community &amp; their own general family species by importing these ultra sub animal savages but they have less than zero justification from any of the usual angles employed. Same goes for the people who claim this isn’t about race given the explicit racial animus these creatures have always had &amp; still to this day openly maintain. While some of us may have French ancestors none of us past nor have had anything to do with these people from the perspective of guilt tripping. In fact John Adams used our own tax dollars to help fund the genocide of the French slavers &amp; we’ve helped them over &amp; over again &amp; given them resources from the moment they revolted.The only arguably guilty parties in relation to haitians are people like the Clintons who have had some of them kidnapped &amp; I have no doubt in my mind that was done with the explicit consent &amp; assistance of some of their own people who were probably rewarded for their participation Even if I’m wrong they keep letting such organizations in, fool me once &amp; all that.It goes without saying that everyone involved in the importation of these disgusting creatures are pure evil &amp; that’s really underselling it, in my opinion they’re more wretched than the haitians themselves quite frankly. Those who openly defend &amp; cheer on the importation of these creatures are only slightly less malevolent, just barely. In my opinion the people who pull the “Its not about race” are second only to those directly responsible but that’s because I personally find deliberately subversive behavior, cowardice, backstabbing &amp; bold faced lies to always be worse than those who are upfront about their evil intentions.Not one person who says its not about race in regards to haitians actually believes those words, even if they know one who isn’t utterly abhorrent which is itself akin to finding an actual unicorn. Saying such a thing is like claiming its not about species in regards to crocodiles being dangerous animals because you encountered one that didn’t actively hunt you. That’s not a hyperbolic analogy, haitians are that bad &amp; everyone knows it. Actually Springfield Ohio would be much safer if they released 20,000 crocodiles into the wild there &amp; on virtually every metric it’d cause much less harm across the board if that was done instead.They ought to change the name of Springfield to Springwood, that’s the setting of a series of horror movies called Nightmare on Elm Street. It’d be quite fitting because unleashing these beasts there is a literal nightmare there that has already eclipsed the fictional horror that takes place in those movies. I wonder if it was intentional they chose a city in the same state &amp; a city with a nearly name as the location those movies take place to create a real life nightmare for those people, it’d be one hell of a coincidence if it wasn’t deliberate on their part.

            That’s the entire problem with Marxists. They believe that the Haitian culture, such as it is, is equal in value to the European culture that produced Bach and Mozart.
“Springfield,” is a town name that has long symbolized Main Street, Midwest, USA.
In the 80sG.I. Joecomics, Springfield, IL was home to the Cobra terrorist group’s secret HQ.
It was also the name of the townThe Simpsonsis set in.

                It takes a special type of retard to even begin down the path of the mental gymnastics to start taking thinking like this seriously. The funny about it is actual retards can see right through it, they cannot think in the abstract &amp; thus are only able to take things at face value. This is why, for example, negroes are far more open, on average, to accepting the reality that they have a low average IQ.The ones who get angry at hearing this have acknowledged it, for proof, if I said accused you of having an attribute that something that was so obviously false about you that it could be dismissed without a second thought you wouldn’t get mad would you? That’s the whole reason blacks have an inferiority complex, ironically their low IQ makes it near impossible to not notice obvious realities. Why they bounce back &amp; forth between flat out admitting they’re retarded among other things like their penchant for enjoying violence &amp; the like all throughout their culture. The only time they flip the script is when they’re being subversive for the purposes of resource acquisition. One minute they’re thug life &amp; so enjoyed committing violence but then when they see a cracker its all sad faces &amp; woe is me, now gibsmedat.On a side note I’m using the original definition which IIRC was considered 70 IQ &amp; below, that the standard that was in place before it was lowered so that the vast majority of negroes wouldn’t be considered retarded by law.Anyway the funny about taking materialism, nihilism &amp; the idea that everything is a social construct to their logical conclusions, which virtually nobody ever does, is that it leads to identical conclusions as the philosophical opposite of what its trying to subvert.All cultures are equal? Well then the old German obsession with Ayranism is equal to Marxism. Boom, defeated, boy that was simple wasn’t it? The jews who invented that bullshit claim would recoil so hard they’d have a panic attack. Speaking of that reminds me of conservatives crying about blacks straight up admitting that they hate objective truth by claiming its White supremacy. What’s even funnier is that its true, I’m sure you saw that infographic that a college released years ago that basically claimed everything from being on time to trying to find objective answers to &amp; basically all acknowledgements of reality is White supremacy. They are literally telling everyone they have an adversarial relationship with reality &amp; that this obsessed with truth &amp; competence is one of the biggest reasons they hate White people.What this reveals is just how marxist conservatism is itself, in some ways the average conservative is far more marxist, nihilistic, collectivist etc than people who openly label themselves as such depending on how you define those terms. This is why conservatives so commonly align themselves with Leftists against people who are far more Right wing than them. Its also why in many many cases ideology is virtually indistinguishable from religion in actual practice, adherence to the faith/ideology matters more than the stated goal of the thing that’s being practiced. Fascism would do a far better job of producing the results conservatives claim classical liberalism, libertarianism &amp; the like claim they’re designed to achieve but sticking to the ideology is more important. Ironically religion has, as far I can tell based on what I’ve observed both firsthand &amp; my admittedly limited knowledge of history, proven to be far more flexible than ideology is.Though you can’t really discuss either without factoring in the people themselves since in the end that’s what’s really being discussed, the current christian majority is a slow motion jim jones cult since it’s welded to liberalism but that’s because the people themselves are. But I’m going off on a wild tangent here so I’ll stop there.Anyway as for the Simpsons there’s been so many oddly specific predictions &amp; coincidences in that show I would love to see someone tally them all up. I bet the number would be staggering &amp; be such a statistical anomaly that the claim its just a coincidence would be a real uphill battle to argue, to put it lightly.

                “Do not mention the voodoo.”One thing Ineversee mentioned about vodoun is the slavery aspect. People love to credit Haitians for their role in inventing the concept of zombies but always conveniently leave our the fact that the whole point of making zombies is to enslave them. There’s a book &amp; a pretty good, and unintentionally semi accurate in an unflattering way, horror movies loosely based on said book that detailed how this came to be.Long story short when they haitians revolted against the French they started by using old african poisoning methods: anything presumed to be toxic from animals, plants arachnids &amp; the like would be made into a powder. That was the basis that would eventually become the power they’d use to blow into people’s faces to “kill” them. They use spiders, snake venom, toxic plants &amp; fugu fish yada yada yada cook it, do some ooga booga ritual shit &amp; then dry it out &amp; grind it into a powder.The main ingredient is the fugu fish, the puffer fish, it’s very toxic &amp; causes numbing of the nerves in low does which is apparently like getting high which is part of the reason why people eat it in high doses it causes paralysis then essentially shuts your entire system down &amp; kills you. However there’s a sweet spot dose where it causes paralysis &amp; you appear dead, your heart stops beating &amp; are essentially indistinguishable from being dead for days. Anyway they make this powder &amp; blow it in the targeted person’s face &amp; then wait for them to be buried alive &amp; then dig them up at night &amp; the enslave them. Between the other pointless toxins they add because erroneously think they’re necessary ingredients when it’s actually only the fugu fish powder &amp; the fact the person is being dosed with enough neurotoxin to make them essentially dead for days causes extreme brain damage hence zombies being depicted as dumb &amp; shambling when walking. As you can imagine these low IQ savages aren’t exactly advanced scientists the powder, when it’s actually active- more on that later- ends up just killing people from overdoing them.The book is about a guy who was sent by a pharmaceutical company to Haiti to investigate a man who was buried alive &amp; resurfaced years later to find out about what these zombies were. You know life after death would be an amazing discovery but he discovered what I just told you. Anyway the haitians are retarded &amp; didn’t know why the powder didn’t work sometimes &amp; that’s because the fugu fish’s diet in that region changes depending on the season. They’re like poison dart frogs in that they don’t actually produce toxins themselves it’s from what they eat. Only during certain times of the year they are able to hunt animals that have the neurotoxin which then builds up in their system &amp; thus makes themselves toxic.As for Adams, I was only fairly recently made aware of this thanks to  Eric Striker mentioned it &amp; provided an article of his that was republished on Unz Review. I swore I had the article bookmarked but can’t find it, so I tried googling to find it &amp; found a quote from a book that was even more revealing than Striker’s original link.Here’s the quote from the book posted on that sire about Adam’s helping Haiti which is by far the most revealing (and damning) info I found yet, I knew about him providing funds &amp; arms but not putting US soldiers under haitian command. I might have to buy that book, I wonder what other interesting info is in there. Anyway here’s the quote:“Adams then got word of the offer and concluded he had to do something. Within six months, the United States and Saint-Domingue entered into a treaty that reopened trade.But Adams did more than that. He had intelligence that the Dominguans had enough strength to win independence from France. So Adams supported Toussaint Louverture with economic aid, arms, munitions and the U.S. Navy.Louverture then faced a mutiny from Andre Rigaud, his mixed-race rival who controlled the southern part of the island. In the spring of 1800, Adams sent five military vessels — the USS Constitution, USS Boston, USS Connecticut, USS General Greene and USS Norfolk — to Louverture’s aid. It was the U.S. Navy’s first military action on behalf of a foreign ally.American commanders planned joint operations with their multiracial Dominguan counterparts. They guarded the southern coast and bombarded a port town held by Rigaud.The Navy brass also did something unusual: placed U.S. ships and crews under Dominguan command. White U.S. Naval officers dined with black Dominguan officers, finding themselves in the racial minority.”https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/john-adams-supports-toussaint-louverture-horrifies-jefferson/Oh and I swear just to spite me the website went down right after I quoted from it because of course it did. It’s annoying because I specifically chose that site because it quoted from that book that went into great detail.Here’s another link that quotes the book as well but only provides a fraction of the quote.https://ugapress.org/book/9780820347691/diplomacy-in-black-and-white/Here’s Eric Striker’s link from the Unz article where I first learned of this.https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&amp;psid=175#:~:text=Under%20the%20administration%20of%20President,the%20French%20and%20mulatto%20military.This is one of many many reasons I am extremely critical of the founding fathers, as well as many of the Whites around back then especially in the North. All of the founders did &amp; supported things that contradict the comically false claim people like Jared Taylor &amp; Greg Johnson like to make about them being White Nationalists.Well just before I decided to hit post I checked one last time &amp; the original link with the long book quote finally came back up. Even if it goes down again it should come back, I’d say check every ten minutes or so, there’s also Striker’s link, z library which is a bootleg site which I personally use to get banned books that are impossible to buy anymore. It is still available though you can buy the book off amazon if you find yourself interested enough in the topic to do a deep dive.Like I said I didn’t even know Adams put troops under haitian command until I found that book quote so I’m glad you asked &amp; I’m glad I had trouble finding Striker’s Unz article which caused me to search google in the first place, a happy coincidence.. Well sort of, it’s even more disappointing knowing he did that but happy that I found more info at least lol. But yeah if the site is giving cloudflare errors just check back later, it’ll load eventually.

                Forgot to mention the book &amp; movie, sorry about that, it’s called the Serpent And The Rainbow.If you’re even remotely interested read the synopsis of the book on Wikipedia &amp; watch the movie if you’re into horror movies, it’s a pretty good Wes Craven movie &amp; acts as a semi accurate documentary. I say semi accurate because it depicts a few haitians as having human like personality traits but the rest? Very accurate minus the spell casting of course, crazy satanic negroes all over the place &amp; all sorts of dark practices which is ironically unintentionally accurate to what they’re actually like.Oh and the book is written by a White shitlib who bent over backwards so far he metaphorically broke his spine in 9 places &amp; displaced 17 vertebrae discs painting these satanic gorillas in the most magical &amp; spiritual ooga booga “wow aren’t these magical negroes amazing” light possible. Given the subject matter it was physically impossible for him to avoid revealing just how utterly savage they are but tried very very hard to blame it on select individuals &amp; poverty, you know the usual bullshit. Also I’m pretty damn sure that book was the basis for the utterly historically fraudulent anti White Quentin Tarantino black/jewish revenge movie Django Unchained. There was some negro who was basically the real life Django from that movie who killed a bunch of French &amp; was executed but allegedly survived through magical negro powers &amp; allegedly went on to commit all sorts of terrorism with the rest of the savages during the revolt.The author could barely contain his glee as he described the horrific uprising. I almost recommend reading it if you want to know in depth just how savage these creatures are &amp; the utter horror the French were subjected to. It was a roller-coaster of a read, equal parts infuriating for multiple reasons &amp; also illuminating in several ways. One of the top politicians or leader (I can’t remember it’s been a over decade since I read it) was described by the British BBC as evil incarnate or something along those lines, it stuck out to me because no media organization would ever say anything like that about a negro now unless it was someone anti semitic or hostile to feminism.Still you can probably get gist off Wikipedia, I’m sure rhe synopsis on there covers the most important bits if you’re interested anyway.

        One can always find some scripture to support one’s side in this debate, whichever side one is on. The only proper response to leftists and colorblind as long as it’s legal normiecons doing so is, “Oh, so you want to live in a theocracy now? I’m down.” Which is just owning the libs and useless, but it’s all that can be said on the subject, because the argument cannot be won, at least not verbally, only aborted, with the blank looks that accompany that end of communication.Truth is, there is little point in engaging in an argument that has already been won and lost. Our side lost. We recognize that and proceed from that point toward what is possible, which does not include saving AINO from the GR. AINO has already fallen to the GR, it is irreversible. It or may not have been politically reversible before the 2020 “election,” I’m not sure, but subsequent to Biden’s Great Importation, it no longer is.The political solution, if there is one (questionable), is to work toward secession. When the time comes, I believe it can happen nonviolently, primarily because there won’t be enough people willing to fight against it. If we can thread the needle and get it done before globohomo builds their drone army.

Not really. One side is lying and misrepresenting, and the other is not.

                ?? That the devil quotes scripture is pretty standard theology.
In the wilderness, He didn’t say the devil misquoted Psalm 91. (?) Just that there was a passage in Deuteronomy that either clarified or disputedthat particular verse, depending on whether scripture is inerrant.

        “Immigration is seen by main stream churches as a solution to their empty pews.” It is also a way to fill their coffers that have come about because of empty pews. Those empty pews and empty coffers came about because the welfare state stole the money from the paritioners who have far less to tithe. The church then has less to offer in acts that demonstrate the principles and give the paritioners a chance to live them out in life – self sacrifice through charity donations and voluteer work that is now done by “the diverse.”We live in a quantitative age. The purpose of a place is not to build it up but to find ways to monetize it and maximize its monetization. It cares about quantity and cares nothing for quality.More people. More coin. More spending == more (toilet paper, car, food, “shelter” … ) sales.Btw, have you noticed that The Regime has in recent months changed its term for housing. It is no longer called Housing. It is now called Shelter. Once again they change the language to announce and normalize the next phase in your dispossession.

Except that doesn’t happen. There may be established a Springfield Haitian Christian church, but it won’t be to the benefit of White pastors and churches. The Haitians will form their own churches, with their own pastors. Perhaps in the buildings left over by abandoned White churches.

Jesus is still holding his whip, breathing heavily, and glaring around. “Now…now look, Jesus, let’s not get carried away here. Let’s just calm down and let’s see if we can straighten this out…”

        The refugee dumping is not unique to Springfield, Ohio. In fact, it is going on across every single Western country at the moment.Here in Canada, most of them are “international students” from India. They come in through legal and semi-legal means, paying large sums of cash in exchange for permanent residency. The result is the same- 2,000 Indian males lining up for a McDonald’s job.We also have straight up refugees. From Haiti, from Africa, who knows why they’re here, but they’re all bisexual, and that’s enough to claim refugees status (and get free hotel and food, forever).Same deal in England. I was in England (not London) in August. Every town had random brown men wandering around. The Muslim looking brown men looked angry. The other brown men were just.. existing. No idea why any of them are there. There is some mechanism by which they are coming there, too.There is a full court press against the Western world. The elites want to destroy everything.

        Since deficits are beyond the comprehension of most people now, nobody talks about the costs being incurred. These ‘immigrants’ (Illegal aliens) are getting at least $3k a month tax free for showing up.  So, just in Springfield, OH that’s 20,000 x 3,000 = $60 million a month and $720,000,000 a year for just that batch of invaders.
Multiply that by whatever number of invaders you believe.

            Your general thinking is correct, but the estimates are waay too high. Welfare is complicated as there are many different programs.  If you take the major ones nationally (exclude SSI) you have perhaps half your estimate ($1500) and those benefits are always computed on a “family” basis, not individual.  There may be some initial increases, but those calm down after settlement (for example, NYC was renting hotels for initial housing of their invaders (“migrants”).  I doubt highly that any family of Haitians, let’s say Mother, Father (if known), spawn 1, and spawn 2, pull down $12k per month ($144k per year) in a city that has a median “household income” of between $40-44k.Even if we simply leave out arguable/unknowable welfare dollar amounts, one can see the (criminal) folly of increasing a city’s population figure by perhaps “20-30 percent” welfare recipients—which is what such a population must be given the situation of their origin. Heck, what city or general municipality can be expected to expand resources to accommodate such a population growth, they can’t.Even with hurricane Katrina, we saw an evacuation (mostly) of residents of New Orleans to as far as CA.  The bus deliveries were specifically designated/limited to what any city could reasonably handle.  If memory serves, we in Tucson received less than a couple of thousand—and we were a city of 500,000 population.

                Parasitism, in nature, is simply a process whereby a species adapts to stealing resources from any animal (or plant) that can marshal them in large quantity. The host organism can be modeled as an abstract “resource flow” and the parasites are like little taps attached to the main flow. Imagine a sort of Christmas tree structure.In modern America our worthless government (state, federal, and local) is the tree trunk. The mass of millions of taxpayers is the “soil” that feeds the tree. Everyone from the slumlords to the fat White guys running landscaping companies that use immigrant labor are the branches. You might model the immigrants (legal or not) as the pine needles. Eventually, everyone who wants a life above poverty level will have to become one of the branches off the main trunk. This is the central goal of the Left right now.This will probably produce some downvotes but I’ve often thought that perhaps, as a matter of self-defense and practical self-preservation, people in Our Thing should consider buying up ramshackle homes and slum apartment buildings. If we can’t cut the tree down, at least we can use some of what it is stealing from us. Perhaps we can save enough to buy a chainsaw.

        Sorry, this is akin to ‘real communism has never been tried’ or “that’s not true capitalism.”The wages of Christ is cuckdom. Who knows more about Christianity? The Pope? Or yourself, sorry Z-Man. No disrespect intended but I take the word of Christian leaders about what Christianity is, just as I take the word of Democratic Party leaders about what the Party is.Christianity is cuckdom, Open Borders and anti-Whiteness is embedded in Christianity. Regardless of what it might have been in 1100, it is NOW undeniably anti-White, and cuck oriented. Every single sect of Christianity is Open Borders, anti-White cuck, save maybe the Russian Orthodox who at any rate have zero appeal to Westerners.The Cuckdom of Christ is why people are “second look at the Austrian” despite his manifest failure and desire to build a giant slave empire in Europe comprised of “lesser” White people: Slavs, Celts, “degenerate” Germans. He even wanted to invade and destroy Switzerland because of its “degeneracy” and was only persuaded not to when the casualty projections of 1 million dead were read out to him.Indeed, for White people to survive they will need not a post-Christian but NON Christian morality. One that utterly rejects the moral framework of original White sin and non-White (particularly black) racial redemption. White people will have to embrace racism, sexism, and anti-Alphabet beliefs in order to have the fighting spirit necessary to survive. In the Second Frontier where the fighting never, ever ends.It is indisputable: the massive non-White invasion is never going back. The government hates you for being White and wants you dead. In this both White women and the Alphabets are allied. Even more non-Whites are coming, both via Government flights and family re-unification. They are above the law, Whites are beneath it. This is not going to change, and the Cuckdom of Christ is about as appealing to White men now as an Acolyte or “Agatha All Along” marathon.My guess is that we will see some sort of organic American Shintoism. Worship of Robert E. Lee, Andrew Jackson, George Washington, Wyatt Earp, and outlaws like William Bonney and John Wesley Hardin. What does Christ offer the average White guy? Bowing down and washing the feet of some Haitian who just ate his dog and r@p3d his girlfriend.I say this in deep regret, as a Christian. But there it is — the concept of original sin directly leads to original White guilt. There is on getting around it. Cuckdom is thus integral to Christianity, sadly. Its why White men have abandoned the church because it in turn demands they hate themselves and their heritage, their fathers and father’s fathers.

        One can at least hope that the next pope is non-white who is even more vocal about flooding Europe with refugees.Perhaps that is what is needed to finally break white people away from that accursed church.Regardless, if we win and survive, the RCC will need to be persecuted out of our lands.There is no way to brush their treachery under the rug.  Justice demands retribution for the damage they have done and the mortal threat they have created to our survival.If you think the problem is limited to Pope Francis, and that his replacement can fix that church, then you are willfully deceiving yourself.

            The next Pope should be a Muslim given the type of people they will be serving. Not sure about Sunni vs. Shia right now. Personally, I’ve always had a certain fondness for the Shia’s undead and hidden 12th Imam. It’s like the plot for a nice horror/sci-fi tale.

        Jesus had nothing to say about immigration in the Gospels. While He might object to some (or maybe all) of the profiteering related to bringing in immigrants, odds are that He would take zero stance on the issue in and of itself, neither pro nor con. Jesus made it clear that He was not a political figure. Likewise, I find it doubtful that anyone can point to a verse in the Old or New Testament that unambiguously favors or opposes open borders. Those citing Scripture to promote unrestrained immigration are extrapolating.This is one of the endless examples of how Americans, even those who claim to be secular / atheist, excessively moralize every issue. It is not apparent to me how it can be morally righteous to dump a bunch of ethnically and culturally ill-suited foreigners upon people who would prefer not to have their surrounding communities so drastically altered.I have frequently heard “We are all equal in the eyes of God.” I have no idea if that is true or not (especially since I can’t completely shake the agnostic doubts I’ve developed over the years). However, even if it is true that God sees us all as equal, we’d be better off not knowing that. Egalitarianism is a poisonous idea that should be off limits to humans. We are not God.

            “Immigration” did not really exist in the ancient world. You had tribes, which were racial/ethnic/language based. They fought wars and became kingdoms and empires and then fought other kingdoms and empires. Defeated tribesmen and women became vassals (if they were powerful) or slaves (if they were not) to the victorious tribes. Wrongdoers in a state got exiled, basically told to leave, and nobody cared about where they ended up. Yes, people could leave and go to some other places, but doing that was insane. If a random person wandered into a land they werren’t familiar with, they were at the mercy of the people of the land – there was no asylum system or visas. They would almost certainly be treated with suspicion if not killed outright and would have to rely on their wits. If there was some flood and massive displacement of a populace, same. Likely most of the people would have been sold into slavery.This idea of treating foreigners as yourself is basically practical and transactional, since once you set foot in a strange land you were at their mercy. The point of it being transactional, though, is that you better understand that you are at their mercy. It’s better to treat them okay if the shoe ends up on the other food. Nobody in the ancient world would seriously impoverish themselves and bend over backwards to help ab unch of foreigners who descend upon a town with barely enough resources as is. It’s just crazy. Something like 90% of the third world migrants that have landed in Europe the past decade are on welfare. They don’t work, they don’t learn the language, and countries like Germany have already resigned themselves to the fact that this is generational. It’s insane. There is nothing biblical about it.

Maybe not in exactly those terms, but when God gave the promised land to the Jews, and aided them in wiping out or driving off all the people who were previously inhabiting it, there’s a darn strong implication that the land, once taken, wasn’t intended to then be overrun by outsiders.

                One could always attempt to refute Vizzini’s point by saying that the Jews are the “chosen people” and that what applied to them was not intended to be universal. Not saying that’s how I would respond — just mentioning a possible rebuttal.

            I believe the correct interpretation is that we are all equal from the standpoint of being equally able to attain salvation. But the attainment of salvation has nothing to do intelligence, culture and social behavior. In those areas we are most definitely not equal.

Profound, seriously profound.  Indisputably the best answer to that question.As profound as the Zman’s assertion that we are caretakers of a property we did not create, and have both will and intelligence that we might fulfill our purpose.

                “I believe the correct interpretation is that we are all equal from the standpoint of being equally able to attain salvation.”That’s a benign reading of the concept which I won’t dispute. Nevertheless, the notion that “we are all equal in the eyes of God” can easily translate into the idea that we should all be equal in each other’s eyes — which is asking far too much of mere mortals — or even worse, that we should attempt to make equal that which is clearly unequal by nature. Human beings are a woefully irresponsible bunch. Give them an ideal that sounds unimpeachably pleasant and they can turn around and use that ideal to engage in all manner of counterproductive or destructive tinkering.

        Look, the majority of “Christian” churches have neutered Christ into some ‘love who you love’ cuddly creature, and by extension God’s Word has to be ignored where needed. Drove by our local Baptist church this weekend, some billboard wording out from about trusting “the Bible” … would love to ask the pastor, They/Them if admonitions about men laying with men, an “abomination punishable by death” and scripture about the “Synagogue of Satan” are typos?Or what gives.Another Protestant church I drove by in a nearby town has THEIR billboard out front listing their manifesto — words including “social justice” and acronyms includindg BLM, LGBTQIA and so on. A word salad.The project of making Christians into pansies is pretty far along. Same for American men.

        The Bible is not a suicide pact. Nor is the Constitution. The Vatican is being run by the jewish mob and/or its puppets and several catholic bloggers openly charge the Pope and his entourage as heretics, apostates and satanists. They are entirely correct to do so. The church has fallen before, and will again. I have every confidence that it will redeem itself sooner rather than later. Remember, God’s plans operate across generations. I can not see Him putting up with this crap forever.The Bible does not tell you to not judge people. It tells you to use judgement. The kicker our Esteemed Blog Host is leaving out is that Christians are obligated to treat Godly people in a Godly way. This is a structural point of failure in Dissident ideology IMHO – and threatens the credibility of the social movement. What is the Dissident supposed to do when confronted by “good” minorities and respectful vibrants? I run into this every Sunday myself at the little chapel out in the country. Right behind my usual spot are a family of black and mixed breed black/brown octoroons or quadroons, and they are the friendliest, nicest people you could ever meet. I use judgement and refuse to see colour in their case. How can you have a problem with well behaved respectful people? And yet, a large percentage of dissidents would tar and feather them along with worst niggers that walk the earth. That just ain’t right, we should be smarter than that.The Bible also clearly spells out the relationship between master, servants, slaves and bondsmen in great detail too. Slaves and bondsmen are to respect and love their masters, masters are obligated to reciprocate. This is why – contrary to the liberal faggotry and brain dead leftist ideologue – slave economies and slave culture actually works and works well. This is why Christianity replaced polytheism in Rome so quickly and completely. Happy slaves and servants are productive slaves and servants.As Dissidents we should not feel unduly threatened by cat eating noggers and savages. The problem will sort itself out soon. One thing Dissidents ARE good at is objective, critical thought. Most are race realists that know enough to avoid being in stupid places with stupid people. Most of the victims of woke ideology are idiots that voat for it or tolerate it. Most are smart enough to be armed and carry. So when some woman gets raped or killed, or some dude gets his throat cut or beaten to death…the majority of time it is either a shitlib that deserves it, or a retarded conservitard that refuses to see reality or race. In reality the vast majority of vibrant crime is ape vs ape – and if someone gets killed in those types of confrontations, the surviving perp should get a medal and a free box of ammo!In my neck of the woods we are seeing the rise of what I would call the Dissident Christian. Secular dissidents should reach out and befriend dissident Christians. And – if your church gets pozzed to the point where you have to walk out and never return – make a point of telling them WHY you are doing so. Tell their bosses further up the food chain too. You are not sinning against God by walking out, you are sinning if you stay and tolerate and condone the presence of evil in your church.

            “The Bible does not tell you to not judge people. It tells you to use judgement”Not letting you get away with that.Its “Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself”The first part of that is the command “Judge not”The second part is the consequence for disobeying the command coming from a man who has repeatedly threatened his followers with eternal damnation.It should be interpreted exactly as it’s written.I’m tired of Christians demanding the book of Genesis be interpreted literally, while simultaneously trying to twist the plain meaning of Jesus’s statements because the left has taken those plain meanings to destroy civilization.And yes, it is impossible to function as a responsible adult without judging people, which is all the more reason to take the whole bible and put it in a rubbish bin.

                And I’m not letting you get away with that either. The Bible has to be taken in it’s entirety, not cherry picked by retarded atheists and fake Christians to support stupid claims or ridiculous viewpoints. That whole document can take a lifetime of study, anyone trying to paraphrase it with a few quotes is a moron trying to put on airs of intellect. In all probability most such people have never even read it, much less studying it or reflecting upon it.
That whose book is about judging people in a fair and Godly manner.

                The more full quote for context is:
“Judge not, that you may not be judged, For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.”
In other words – do not be a hypocrite.  You will be judged by the same standards you judge others.  So it does not, in fact, prohibit you from judging others.  It simply admonishes you that what is good for the goose is good for the gander.

            I take exception to the judgement part.Mathew 7:1 is fairly straight forward and easily understood.Other than that, well stated and well spoken.Bravo.
I am of the camp that Francis is not a legitimate Pope and the Holy See is currently open. As a Catholic of nearly 58 years, this is hard to contemplate and/or accept.Like you said – “The Church has fallen and will fall again”.I believe it has fallen and I am anxious for it to rise again.

            Somehow I doubt it.  How did we get Francis?  Supposedly from all I read—over decades—was that John Paul and Benedict had appointed the “most conservative” College of Cardinals—ever.  A new and conservative CC was to be their “lasting legacy”.  Latin masses for all. Yada, yada…
Well, we got Francis—who was widely known to be of the South American Leftist ilk, and now he’s appointed a new College of Cardinals.  Where do we see Leftists anywhere, after they’ve infiltrated and taken over an institution, relinquish control?

        Nice try, Z, I mean it–reallynice try.  I couldn’t do better, and probably not half so well, although I wouldn’t try to ascribe attitudes towards a religious figure set in the First Century AD, who may not even have existed.  But modern Christianity is hopelessly universal, and is a very visible part of the general evolution of white people towards an inability even to recognizethe Otherwhen they make their appearance.

            Christianity™(Roman or otherwise) is man-made and self-serving; prone to all the failures and misdeeds of any human institution. Christianity™was hopelessly corrupt and off the rails by the first ecumenical council.
Jesus was a prophet for his age and was one in a line of prophets that God inspired to various peoples around the world to clarify His message. I think we’re due for another great prophet to reaffirm His message for those with ears to hear.

        Quoting scripture in support of arguments is such a fool’s errand.  I’m not talking about the “truth” of the Bible or the existence of God.

        ZMan makes a good if incomplete argument here. Jesus is far more angry at modern immigration than even he suggests. The topic is a large one but I will try to be brief.Babel rhymes with Babylon is codified as Babylon in the Book of Revelation. Babel is the nascent form of the 666 entity of Revelation which stands for a totalizing(6) human(6) system that brings the fringe of society into the center(6). GAE is a highly developed form of it as making the minority and miscreant the center of your society is the last 6 of progression.The problem of a single humanity is it has no perspective outside itself and pulls all evil into itself. God confused language at the Tower of Babel in order to create separate nations in order to create separate petri dishes of human development that sometimes war against each other as a correction to the failures. The separation of the nations is critical to God’s plan and needs to be respected. He did this before Abram became Abraham as a setup for the nation of Israel. Israel was the nation that was suppose to belong to God from inception and follow His ways in all things. The strictness of the purity codes was to force that pattern of existence, which one must keep in mind when reading them although the underlying principles can be transferred to modern times. This model can be seen as a “one against all” approach to national competition, and Israel was destroyed multiple times for refusing its role. Both the laws and the refusal of those laws presents a map of the terrain that one can use to navigate to success, and so God progressed His plan to the Age of Gentiles where it is an “all against all” approach to national competition in creating the kingdom of God on earth where His will is done here as it is in heaven (Mt 6:10).Satan’s counter to this plan is to take a nation progressing on the Christian path and flood it with non-Christians through conquest, ideally, or immigration otherwise and return humanity to the Tower of Babel. This is confirmed in Revelation (Rev 12:13-17 &amp; 17:1-18).To make your nation a disciple of God (Mt 28:19-20), you must separate yourself from the surrounding nations and their ways. The form of this is revealed in the purity codes where what is evil is removed by destruction and anything from the outside world must be purified before coming into your nation – both people and items. Book burning does not even begin to describe God’s absolute purity program (Nu 31:13-24; Dt 7:1-5; Dt 12:30-31; Dt 13; etc.). The immigrants who make it through are not considered a true part of the nation until at least three generations if they start close to you (Dt 23:7-8). The number of generations needed to assimilate increases with spiritual distance up to ten, and those that would need more than ten generations are not allowed to immigrate into your nation at all (Dt 23:3-6). The program in the Age of Gentiles need not be that severe, but the principles remain. “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers” applies to immigration the same as marriage (2 Cor 6:14), and so immigrants should be of the faith or at least highly compatible with it. A nation that is serious about this should limit immigration to people who are very close in spirit. Those who are close in biology are often close in spirit because ancestral lineage has an effect on both.The opposite of this is the rootless cosmopolitan who sees all religions as equally valid ways to spiritual fulfillment. They are spiritual whores and detestable before God. Those who recklessly mix nations, particularly with the intent of flooding out Christian aspects for Pagan idolatry, are agents of Satan.Evangelism and charity in other nations is a whole other topic. The brief summary is that the present leaders of the Church have no concept of dominion or authority because they do not believe in them, and so their work in other nations is done improperly and has the effect of strengthening evil which the Bible commands against. Their god lives in the TV.

        First of all, the idea that different races can live in peace together was never a mainstream thing.There was no need to make any statements about it because it’s so obvious. Here is st Augustine commenting on the whole race mixing idea which he may have only guessed could have become a problem. Notice he just doesn’t say, “this is my opinion”. He cites the apostles and calls it a rule. Citing the apostles is no joke. It means there is no changing it or overruling it:St. Augustine on Galatians 3:28:“Difference of race or condition or sex is indeed taken away by the unity of faith, but it remains imbedded in our mortal interactions, and in the journey of this life the apostles themselves teach that it is to be respected, and they even proposed living in accord with the racial differences between Jews and Greeks as a wholesome rule.”

        Also…Jesus defines “neighbor” in Luke by telling a story whose cast might actually number in the single digits (low single digits at best). A story with only one victim (the traveller beset by thieves and left for dead) and only one person fitting Jesus’ def. of neighbor (it”s left unaddressed whether the innkeeper who temporarily takes a financial hit to house the traveller is also “neighborly”).Whereas the Springfield thing has a cast of tens of thousands of people, and the so-called victims (the Haitians) are very much not near death. Scale matters. (Though odds are, being Haitians, most of them worship death through their ungodly practice of voodoo, which involves, among other sorcery, them trying to be possessed by the spirits of their ancestors, making them at least spiritually dead.)I’m Baptist, so although I would be obliged to help someone in such distress as Jesus’ story regardless of ethnicity, I would not obliged to support the mass importation of people into my community who don’t share my religious beliefs (and it’s safe to say among the 12-20k Haitians, hardly any of them are reformed Baptists). Even if they largely were (in which event, we certainly aren’t talking about Haitians anymore), it would do no favors to the neighbors to introduce to them the X-factor of having to suddenly compete for resources with tens of thousands of people.I already don’t like it that cop-car visit are a recurring presence on our street in Murray, Ky. (Last year, it was at least 4 calls for domestic stuff w/ the black guy across the street. There was also a cop/ambulance double team for the bizarre white guy who would just sit on his patio all night and stare into nothingness and ignore you if you said hi. The black guy moved out, but the spacey white dude was replaced by a younger black dude who was paid a visit by the Murray fuzz last week. There was a break- in down the street in Jan., perpetrator unknown, but based on the timing of his subsequent arrest, might be the white methhead thief they keep arresting and letting out on bail only to be re-arrested, etc. Which is another thing: we don’t even deal with all the stuff we do have effectively. But it’s gonna go great with a Murray St. basketball arena’s worth of low-IQ necromancers?).Six weeks ago, when I was waiting at the laundromat for my clothes to dry, I went over to the Wal-Mart to get something. Place was crazy with Mexicans. Like 50 people at the registers and in line, almost all Mexicans. Never saw it before here (been here 3 yrs). Went back to the laundromat, bus pulls up, more Mexicans. Haven’t seen it since, but imagine that times 2000 every day, everywhere. Doctor appts, shopping, looking for an apartment, driving, whatever. These things can escalate quickly. And it’s not un-Christian to say it ain’t right. (Luckily our church is not SBC, so we don’t have to constantly be fighting our leadership on these things.)

        Z-man,You keep seeing the Church through the eyes of the modern Jesuits and therefore the facade pulled over the true Church.The Catholic Church’sofficialposition (one that is in writing, albeit not being enforced today) is from the Pontifical Council document:People on the Move, N° 88-89 – Migration and the Social Doctrine of the Church (vatican.va)which basically state that countries should consider immigrants if it can economically take them on, but can reject them with good cause.The SDC also recognizes the right of states to control entry of persons and their borders. They have a right and duty to protect their sovereignty as well as the internal order that guarantees security, basic human rights and freedoms. Thus states can make practical decisions that control immigrationIn better times of the Church today’s mass immigration would be condemned and direct other action in the influencing the countries from which come the immigrants would be the focus of action.But indeed what you point out is the Church’s acting position, which is clearly in conflict with it’s teachings.The rhetoric the heretical Bergoglio is spouting is incompatible with tradition and theology. So what you and the world sees from this Church leadership is indeed the deepstate, the same deep state forces who has taking over most Western governance. You see the front men and women, who are a bunch of clown puppets, in front of the microphone with those in charge of money talking through them; as displayed in Luca Signorelli’s fresco La predicazione dell’Anticristo….The difference between the Nation States and the Church is that underlying the false facade of the Church remains the core doctrines that time and people cannot erase. But in the Nation States lies a democracy where all things are changeable and can be exterminated in fullness.The Church will survive this crises, however what will come out will be a much smaller form, but those who will be forged by this crisis and keep in Christ much more adherently. I doubt if any substance of the Western governments will remain as it was or ever has been.

        Although what Letitia James did to Vdare was certainly unethical, it was apparently NOT illegal. I would like to suggest to an incoming Trump Justice Department start investigating the pseudo-Christian organizations that are giving vital logistical support to the migrant invasion. We’d like a list of all their donors please. How about their emails? What’s good for Peter Brimelow is good for the likes of David FrenchWe patriotic nationalist might be good at tactics such as Cat-Eating-Hattians mimes, but clever tactics are not enough. We need better strategy.  Napoleon didn’t stop invading Russia until he ran out of food. Whose is feeding these 20 million invaders? It is about time it is stopped.

        “This is the official position of the Catholic Church. ”You’re welcome to bounce me, as this is your own board, but it is not the official position of the Catholic Church. Migrants/foreigners into new lands have an obligation to be law abiding, work hard, etc. Countries have duties to protect their citizens, etc. The official teaching is very complex and is simply not as simple as treat everyone equally. If I did that I would be a terrible Christian because I would be a terrible wife, mother, etc.What we see in the media is largely shaped by a)lefties/Jews and b)people reacting to the lefty Anglosphere media. We will hear all the soundbites out of context about migrants. We will not hear all the soundbites from bishops and Pope Francis that do not conform to modern lefty thinking.“The logic of Christianity tells us that Jesus would be appalled by what is happening in towns like Springfield Ohio. Rounding up Haitians and dumping them into unsuspecting towns around North America does nothing to reduce the damage done to God’s most precious property, mankind. In fact, it increases the damage. Worse yet, this damage is done for the benefit of the money changers responsible for it. What we see happening with immigration is a deliberate offense to the Christian God.”What I guarantee you is that if Pope Francis says something to this effect, as the Haitians are clearly lawless and even godless, we will not hear it. Or if we do it will be in some sort of soundbite form that says the opposite of what he intended.

        They claim Scripture requires the faithful to treat everyone equally, as God’s children.
It is true they make those claims, but i don’t see any support for it.  In fact, the exact opposite – scripture is pretty clear you become God’s child through adoption (baptism), not simply through creation.  God’s creature, yes (all created in His image and likeness); God’s child, no.

        This is the official position of the Catholic Church.Well, it is the stated position of:(1) a person who claims the chair of Peter; and(2) Many post Vatican II formed prelates and assorted apparatchiks.Jury is still out on the legitimacy of both.The official position of the Catholic Church is spelled out in its Tradition as enunciated over 2000 some odd years through magisterial pronouncements.  You are looking at a very thin slice of current thought of rather unimpressive Church bureaucrats.  Most of the “Church” also bought into the Arian heresy at one point.But yes, it is unfortunately the position of such current bureaucrats.

        Theological reasons aside, Christianity arose as a small, persecuted religious sect that was open to everyone. Combined with its recognition of all people as children of God, that misleads some people into thinking that Christiansocietiesshould also be open to everyone, which is not true. Every society, Christian or not, defines who may or may not be in it — which people are members of the “in-group” and which are outsiders.“The larger point is: If you’ve got social division, then deal with it as well as you can. Avoid doing anything that would make the situationworseby creating even more social division.

        Yahweh hung out in Eden with Adam and Eve. By the NT, you have the Father in Heaven, who barely makes an appearance. In fact, you have to die just to have the chance to meet Him. Yahweh gets angry and regrets creating humanity, the Father is perfect and loves perfectly. Things get more abstract. The more abstract, the less of this world, the less life imo. Seriously, think about it: if you want peace, perfection,  and oneness, you might have them someday— just not in this fallen world, in this life. Even Jesus didn’t have them here. He even brought a sword to divide. In life, struggle; in death, peace. Take up your cross, right?

        Let us pray for the wretched Ethopians in central Africa, that Almighty God may at length remove the curse of Ham from their hearts, and grant them the blessing to be found only in Jesus Christ, Our God and Lord-Pius IX, the Book of Indulgences, 1878wgat moderns of all stripes don’t understand is that if Christ was god then he didn’t leave it up to the folly of man to interpret a bible he never commissioned himself or to make up conflicting Teachings . The Bible is a document of the Catholic Church and can’t be morally interpreted on your own to come up with conclusions opposed to the teachings of the church.so too with prayer. The above prayer promises  the graces Christ won to those who pray it. Now if the prayer is racist, abs racism was evil, no popecould have promulgated it to the whole church which the above prayer was.my problem is convincing people Francis is no pope. People see his hat and think he’s the popes he’s no more a pope than I am. There has been no pope since pius xii. It’s the only way to understand why the Vatican is so evil nowthe Catholic church never taught the races must be all mixed up and the church can’t change her major moral teachings or she is worthless and even evil and no one should have ever listed to her

                Respectfully disagree. The courting is the ongoing, naked agenda-pushing in these pieces, attempting to get the Christian demographic to accept Thielism. “Jesus just HATES those dirty immigrant lovers! Can you just feel your hate?? It’s even biblical! Did you hear the immigrants eat cats?? CATS!!!! You know what we need to keep them out?? A SMART WALL!!!!”
Not saying immigration (as a manufactured crisis) isn’t an important point of dissident conversation, but the police surveillance state has always been more central and higher on the priority list. You won’t hear about that here for obv reasons.

                    Smart wall? Where does Z argue for that? Seems you’re arguing against a strawman. Yes, just aboutanycall for tougher enforcement of any law can be twisted into a way to strengthen the police state. Think of the reaction to 9/11. Originally, it led to perfectly valid scrutiny of Muslims in the US. As time went on though, it became more about turning Homeland Security into a new Stasi.Most of us here don’t want a smart wall, just a return to sensible immigration policies like those that prevailed until 1965 or so. There was no technology available for a smart wall back then but the real physical and legal barriers did quite a good job just the same. Thiel is a typical tech oligarch so he’s always looking for a way to sell some whizbang nonsense to the government. That’s how those guys get rich. He has some good ideas but no one here is following him as some kind of a guru. My view of him is similar to my view of Musk. He can be…useful…sometimes. Musk seems further along the road towards becoming an outright dissident, perhaps because he sees the US as a weak and fragile state now and thinks that with all the money he has, he can set himself and his friends up as some kind of Junta. He may be right in fact.

        Not all hominids are Gods children no matter how much Judeo-Christian Universalist want it to be true‘God Made a Racial Choice’https://archive.org/details/god-made-a-racial-choice/mode/2up?view=theaterand the Catholic menace is a much bigger problem:https://fgcp.org/content/catholic-menace-part-1“The Vatican and the Papacy was never in Jerusalem. Let me paint you a picture of how the Mediterranean world operated at that time to give you a better understanding of how the catholic menace arose after the death and resurrection of Christ. The rise of the Papacy was a time and age that was anything but perfect and abounded with causes tending to corrupt whatever was simple and materialize whatever was spiritual. The jewish worship of symbolism, as if handed down from heaven, had taught the catholic mind to associate religious truth with visible rites and rituals, and to attribute considerably more importance to the observance of the outward ceremony than to the cultivation of the inner man or how a Christian should conduct themselves in having the right mentality, having the mind of Christ.”

        So wrong:Our ability to understand God at all rests on the assumption that he possesses all the qualities we possess as human beings.If Israel’s imaginary god had all the qualities of humans, it would not be a necessary or unlimited being; it would be unnecessary and finite. It would not be omnipotent. It would not be omniscient. It would not be dependent upon a body or have material parts. It would be prone to habitual vice. It could commit suicide. And so on.Also wrong, but not your error:Fundamental to the Christian faith is that we are God’s creation and humans are made in God’s image.It would be impossible for the god of Israel to make facsimiles of itself if it were the only necessary, conscious being. It’s supposed to be a ghost with no material part, which means a reasonable facsimile would likewise be a ghost with no material parts. There’s a problem with the Trinitarian concept of a reasoning god, too. Only ignorant beings have reasons for thinking, making inferences, and positing conjectures about reality. An omniscient being would have no need to think. The Noahist doctrine of imago dei is poorly conceived.God does not make mistakes, at least this is true for the New Testament GodSo claim the believers. This leads to a problem. Does it refrain from mistakes by necessity or by choice? If by necessity, its will is constrained in a way that human will is not, and the god must have changed since the older testament was written. If it refrains from mistakes by choice, its behavior in the older teatament becomes understandable, but there’s no higher level god to punish the god of Israel for its wrongs. So much for justice, about which Israel has been bloviating since ancient times.

Why would a facsimile have to have all the exact same attributes?  In that case it wouldn’t be facsimile – it would be a clone.“Image and likeness” does not mean exactly the same.  A painting of a tree has the image and likeness of a tree, but it is not a tree.  Artists often talk about pouring their “heart and soul” into a project, but that doesn’t make the project an exact duplicate of the artist, although it may have some of the artist’s attributes.

            God refrains from mistakes by nature of His being.  You are simply regurgitating the same millennia old logical fallacy of “God can’t make a square circle therefore he is not omnipotent.”  God can make a square; God can make a circle.  A square circle is a contradiction  – a nonexistent thing (the one negates the other).  Therefore by nature you can’t make that which is not.Refrain is not even a proper term as it is not a holding back or limitation.  What you posit is simply a nonsensical statement like “square circle” or blue feet tall or weighing five inches or anything Kamala says.

        The New York Times admits what Trump said is true about the swarms of Haitians:
“Estimates range between 12,000 and 20,000, according to city officials who have spoken with The Times. The estimates are based on data from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, Springfield’s public schools, health care providers in the area and social service agencies, the officials said.”

        Books don’t make politics, and there’s nothing more irrelevant to Christianity than Jesus.
Christianity is about bringing pet-eating Africans to your town becausethat’s what Christians do. The Bible has nothing to say on the subject and no analogous material from which to extrapolate. White Christian traitorousness—”pathological altruism” if you prefer to lie—is unprecedented.
What would Jesus do? Exactly what he does. Rot on a shelf. He’s a character in the 400AD equivalent ofNaked Lunch.

        God does not care about social justice or the fate of nation states. He just wants everyone to recognize their place as his slave (property) and act accordingly (complete obedience). Any other issue, from gay rights to the survival of the Aryan race, is only relevant as it helps or hinders obedience to God. That’s the Bible.

            That unfortunately is how it began. As official state propaganda, legitimizing obesiance to the State, as the royal representative ordained by the gods.
That’s why the Books were written. Before they were suborned, the Aryans worshipped the Dyeus Pater, the Sky Father, the law in their hearts.
(Called ‘Waralda’ in the Aryan Bible, the Orea Linda, older than the Hebrew Bible)
Not the way the supremacist “God” is used today, I get that.But back then, everyone recognized that the plural, Elohim (‘the gods’, not ‘the God’), meant each kingdom, city, and man had their own gods, and respected that.

                Nonetheless, credit due to the Zman for speaking to Christians in their own dialect. Well done, very well done indeed.
