        Syria was a reasonably well functioning country 15 years ago, with Assad protecting Christians and minorities…Then the US and its minions decided to create a color revolution, accompanied by strangling sanctions and US military occupation of a major. oil producing area…That failed due to Russian military intervention, as did a later attempt in 2015…This time, the Syrian Arab Army refused to fight, probably due to bribery, and the Russians gave up…Now it’s Lord of the Flies territory…The lesson is that no smaller country can indefinitely withstand destruction by the concerted action of powerful countries….

            it’s crazy how every action the USA takes in the Middle East leads to slaughter of Christians, dismantling of Christian communities, and mass migration of non-Christians into the USA and Europe where the ties of Christianity are further weakened. But no, that’s surely just a coincidence.

                D.C. would like to crush American Christians too, but there might be resistance, you see.  There’s a lot of pesky Christians and some are pretty feisty about their satanic government.
Small countries on the other side of the world . . . no problem!

                    ray, the number of Christians who share your beliefs is small. Most self-professed Christians are f@gs whom the government likes.
Governments need to crush the people who, Christian or not, believe in traditional sex roles and ethnonationalism.
Don’t discount the non-Christians who share most of your beliefs and we won’t discount your Christianity.
It will be a blessed day if together we ever triumph and have to sort out our religious differences. I’m pulling for you guys.

                        ‘Most self-professed Christians are f@gs whom the government likes.’Like the rest of American society, the Christian ‘churches’ are feminized and emasculated.  I avoid these doods same as the gelded atheists and agnostics.One day back when I lived in Amerika the neighbor, who was a fresh-outta-bible-college Pastor Boy (maybe 22 or 23) gave me the rote ‘When Will I See You in Church?’ line.I told him if I walked into his church it’d spontaneously combust.  I also told him (twice) that serving God was not a career.‘Don’t discount the non-Christians who share most of your beliefs and we won’t discount your Christianity.’Well I’m here ain’t I?

                            Yep. I’m all for Christianity but unfortunately there are probably more Christian Zionists in the Israel Lobby than Jewish Zionists, LOL.
It’s incredible how many of these guys do not understand their own religion. Christianity properly understood is a rejection of Jewish tribalism, exclusivity, arrogance, self-righteousness and perceived superiority, not a affirmation of it.
Christianity is overdue for a Second Reformation.

        Stalin was infinitely worse than Hitler.  The holocaust happened in wartime in the occupied territory.  The holocaust happened to non-Germans.  If you were a good German in Nazi Germany, you were pretty much free to live a normal life, at least before the war.Stalin ran a terror state. You could be arrested and tortured into confessing anything without cause.  The police literally had arrest quotas.  Stalin’s forced labor camps were probably more lethal than any of the Nazi so-called death camps.Blaming Hitler for the war is a bit disingenuous.   While Hitler certainly failed to avoid the war, both in the West and East, he had a lot of willing partners, starting with the Poles themselves, not to mention France and Britain.  Stalin was building out his forces to invade. That’s why Hitler was able to capture so many soldiers and crush all their positions early on.  They were in forward attack positions, not defensive dug in positions to repel a German invasion.

            One thing that gets me is that policy of Israel in the last year is basically a claim that the Holocaust was morally justified. The Israelis are trying to completely exterminate/expel a large civilian population as punishment for and war again a “terrorist group” (Hamas) that emerged from and is embedded in it. Well, the civilian Ashkenazi Jews in 1930s Europe also had armies of terrorists emerge from and be embedded in them, in the form of violent Spartakist/Bolshevik/Communist revolutionaries whose goal was to do the horrible things to the Germans and other Europeans that their compatriots had already done to the Russians and Ukrainians. If extreme collective punishment for embedded terrorism is morally OK, then objectively philosophically Netanyahu and his extreme Zionist cronies seem to be advancing the hypothesis that mustache man DNW. (of course, their actual beliefs seem to be that they are always in the right, and that all violence they do is moral and all violence against them is immoral).

                The Old Testament is full of genocides carried out “righteously” by the Jews against pretty much all their neighbors. This kind of thinking isn’t novel withNetanyahu. It may be that Netanyahu and his Zionist friends are just more honest about what they’re up to than previous Israeli leaders have been though.

        Somebody had to expect the collapse. I firmly believe that the Syrian Army officers were paid off and / or blackmailed into abandoning their units.  Once they were gone, most of the rest of the army just walked away.

            The Syrian officers were making a pittance, so there was no need to pay them off. What happened to them is the value in supporting the regime dropped to zero, so they quit supporting the regime.

                Is that why Biden is attempting to federalize the National Guard, with authorization to shoot citizens, as quick way to get around Posse Comitatus?
One would hope it would be to defend us from the invading horde once the balloon goes up (which is the NG and state militias’ job anyways), but I’m betting they’ll be expected to throw in with invaders given permission like the Muslims are in Europe.

        ‘Fate of Empires’ by Sir John Glubbp.12-13In the fourteenth century, the weakening empire of Byzantium was threatened, and indeed dominated, by the Ottoman Turks. The situation was so serious that one would have expected every subject of Byzantium to abandon his personal interests and to stand with his compatriots in a last desperate attempt to save the country. The reverse occurred. The Byzantines spent the last fifty years of their history in fighting one another in repeated civil wars, until the Ottomans moved in and administered the coup de grâce.p. 15In the first half of the ninth century, Baghdad enjoyed its High Noon as the greatest and the richest city in the world. In 861, however, the reigning Khalif (caliph), Mutawakkil, was murdered by his Turkish mercenaries, who set up a military dictatorship, which lasted for some thirty years. During this period the empire fell apart, the various dominions and provinces each assuming virtual independence and seeking its own interests. Baghdad, lately the capital of a vast empire, found its authority limited to Iraq alone.The works of the contemporary historians of Baghdad in the early tenth century are still available. They deeply deplored the degeneracy of the times in which they lived, emphasising particularly the indifference to religion, the increasing materialism and the laxity of sexual morals. They lamented also the corruption of the officials of the government and the fact that politicians always seemed to amass large fortunes while they were in office.Soon after this period, government and public order collapsed, and foreign invaders overran the country. The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women to move unescorted in the streets, with the result that this feminist movement collapsed.The disorders following the military takeover in 861, and the loss of the empire, had played havoc with the economy. At such a moment, it might have been expected that everyone would redouble their efforts to save the country from bankruptcy, but nothing of the kind occurred. Instead, at this moment of declining trade and financial stringency, the people of Baghdad introduced a five-day week.

            Psychologist Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel argued that the destruction of traditional morality with the attendant blooming of depravity and degeneracy always herald chaos and disaster. She arrived at her conclusions through social psychology, but they seem to tally quite well with the historical record.

                    My husband mentioned that to me a few weeks ago and I justread it now.  Fascinating and utterly predictable.  Although the linked article mentions the vital importance of premarital chastity, it does not specify ‘female’ premarital chastity.  But that was the historical pattern, and as we’ve seen, without external male and societal control, women’s sexuality seems to run amok.  Although pederasts have long been known to feature hundreds of sexual partners, that has not been the general  pattern for normal men.  But now women openly brag of dozens of partners and one father’s daughter just rutted with 100 men in one day.  No, we are not special and immune from the Gods of the Copybook Headings.  May they return, and soon.

                        “it does not specify ‘female’ premarital chastity. But that was the historical pattern, and as we’ve seen, without external male and societal control, ”Men cannot enforce chastity on women without some self control themselves. The alphabet people running amok is about a social majority of men sowing their wild oats and then being impotent to do anything when they got older. The minority of men who have some integrity are then also are helpless in the face of the social majority.Yes, for many reasons chastity in women matters more. However, that cannot exist in world where the men are writing themselves blank checks on the point.

                            Fair point.  Men were celebrating ‘sexual liberation’ in the late ’60s and 1970s, because it meant one could easily bed without being wed.  Most were not thinking past their crotches to what this would mean for long-term marriage/fidelity and parenthood.  Unwin describes the lowest level of human society as ‘zoistic,’ focused entirely on day-to-day wants and needs.   A pattern we are all familiar with by virtue of AINO’s non-White population – lack of future time orientation.

                                Harams are all the rage, hypergamy means the women end up all trying to get the same man. The only losers are men not in the upper 10 percent of the population. You see the same in the economy.  And when Chad knocks a five or a six up, he leaves, the state picks up the pieces, taking some money from all the men who aren’t getting any.  What a tangled web we weave.  A thought experiment for the readers: Who has easier access to sex? The average guy? Or the average women?

                                    We’ve all seen the videos and articles about women who are 40+, single/divorced, celebrating living their ‘best life’ focusing on mememememe . . . and the equal number of posts/clips lamenting “Why am I so alone?” as their wiser friends settle down and raise families.  I am as misanthropic as they come, but I’d slowly go nuts if I was utterly alone all the time.  My husband and I give each other space (as much as we can in our tiny cabin) but we also provide one another with friendship, intellectual stimulation, physical assistance and attraction, and all the rest that ought to accompany a good marriage.

                                        That is commendable, but i’m not certain what your point is? Please elaborate. To clarify myself, i’m not saying “all” women are like this, i know you guys hate that, i’m saying the majority are. When was the last time you tried to date women in their 20’s and 30’s? 😉
Did you consider my thought experiment?
Humanity is a herd species, can we agree on that?  And from my personal exp. seeking the safety of the herd is more of a female trait (not saying some men don’t do the same).

But if you’re a dude and you look for confirmation for your exp. you have to actually search for it? And lets be honest, even when i was in high school, before i even knew what feminism or female nature was, all the hot girls in my grade were dating seniors or football players. Why did they do that? Why did Sharon, a beautiful blond i worked the cubes with years ago who had great chemistry with me, dress up in a stunning white dress the day i had an interview for a different job and go out of her way to bend over and make sure i got a great view of her cleavage? Ah Sharon, she was married you know. Why not get divorced before you try picking up a new guy? Does it cause a rush? A boost to the ego? Nothing wrong with that, we all have those moments, the difference is learning to recognize it and then not act on it.Bottom line:  If i can’t use violence to get what i want, you can’t use sex to get what you want!  Equality!

                                    It still can’t be separated from the modern male.  The modern female has been conditioned to consider sex as the equivalent of a goodnight kiss.  She longs for a life partner, but needs to “put out” to sell herself as such.  Males, especially young males of course, will never say “no thanks” to sex, and females become jaded after a number of fruitless liaisons and never pair bond appropriately if a life partner is found.  Males *must* be taught by their fathers this social aspect of sex—not simply the biological aspects.  Alas, fathers are exactly what more and more “modern” family units lack.  And so it goes.  Been there, done that.

                                Samuel Johnson wrote in the 1700s, “Nature has given women so much power that the law has very wisely given them little.”
Men must constrain women’s sexual power because if it is unleashed, men go crazy and things fall apart.
I can sympathize with women who feel unfairly put upon. They can get pregnant, and at least as significant, if they are allowed to flaunt their bodies for personal gain, then men lose their minds, and everything collapses.
Sorry ladies. Civilization depends on men restraining your sexual power. Get mad at God or nature.

                                    Countries that restrict female power, especially female sexual power, typically thrive and last.Countries that don’t restrict female power fail from within, and fall.Countries that gleefully ‘liberate’ female sexuality and empower females across-the-board in all aspects of society — turning females into the supervisors and cultural rulers of men — are condemned by God for their joyful rebellion against Him and nature. Those countries get the Special Treatment.Women rage against this truth about restricting their chaotic, emotive, vengeful natures.  Their daddies rage against it, and the simps that women ‘educate’ and neuter rage against it.  All in vain.Around and around we go.  Nothing new under the sun.

                                        Absolutely.  I didn’t mean to let men off the hook.
I’m not a believer, but I enthusiastically support the old idea of Christian restraint regarding sexuality.  Those teachings contain immense civilizational wisdom.
Were we to adopt those teachings again, we men would all be longing for sexual abandon, but society would be much more secure.
The “Penthouse Letters” fantasies of the 1980s lead to ruin.

                                Great comment.  I imagine in my mind a sloping graph that represents societal wellbeing.  The most “fun” time to be alive was probably just as the graph line started to dip down, past the point of no return but before collapse was obvious.  This would be roughly the late sixties and seventies. Boomers banging each other for fun without fear of stds, smoking grass, and not knowing how this would invoke the divorce, suicide, crime, and drug overdose epidemic for their children and grandchildren.

                            So females whoring around is the fault of men.  Right.
Why is it in modern Western societies that any fault that females have must be laid at the feet of men?  That’s running society according to Feminist Logic, and the results are all around us.

                                Well, to an extent, yes.  The act takes two, does it not?  The men are considered the more rational of the sexes, the women the more emotional.  Does not such distinction entail “restraint” on the part of men?

                        How to keep the daughters from whoring around typically is the central problem for any society, because then the birth rates plummet.  Nations used to be realistic about this fact.U.S society can’t even admit that this IS a problem, because that might suggest that females are less than holy, pure, kind goddesses.  It might also suggest that females have ravenous sexual appetites, which often they do.  Instead, America infantilizes and empowers its daughters, to the ruin of all.Liberating females from all consequences, sexual and otherwise, is America’s method.  Dads of daughters love that their princesses go to the front of every line, whether in education or employment, and is almost guaranteed a Fabulous Career because that way, she’ll Never Need No Man and will be daddy’s precious cupcake lifelong.  Hmm.  Yeah, nice going.Woman is chaos, and a weak vessel.  Liberating her from all restraint and placing her in charge of men is satanic.  It is begging for ongoing disaster and eventual destruction.  We’re in the Ongoing Disaster phase right now.

                        Rodney Dangerfield had a funny line about sex and meeting women. He said, “the eight hours of having to bullshit ain’t worth the eight seconds.”
I always thought that was insightful. Of course, we are all human beings and we are made to procreate, but it does seem rather silly than everybody is so fixated on eight seconds of pleasure. TV, movies, music, video, politics, the legal system … It’s like that’s all they talk about.

                            The 8 hours of bullshit seemed a lot more worth it at 18 than it does at 54. I expect that still holds true for today’s 18 year olds

                            Too much is made of both the simulation of ‘romance,’ that today’s women make such a big deal out of (the fancy restaurants, flowers, etc.) and animalistic, exhibitionist sex.  But . . . without sex and physical intimacy marriage is just friends and roommates.  Both the relaxed, natural companionship and the ‘8 seconds’ matter.

                                Our feminist nations are the result of 800 years of Western Romanticism.  America, in particular, is what happens when men romanticize women.
Romanticism is neo-gnostic and demonic.  It has nothing to do with Godly/Biblical relationship and marriage.

Women have been with us pure, noble, utterly virtuous men- so blameless are we, so unselfishly good are we to them!- for a rather long time, yet something happened in the late 1800s.After 1881, possibly. Nah. No way. Couldn’t be.You see, it was the women themselves who made Liberation a movement.Yes, yes, the women gave us:LiberationFeminismPornographyIndustrialized abortionThe Pill itselfThe Labor marketMinority statusIntersectionalityIt was the women, all on their own, who invented these things, cooked them up out of their silly little heads, organized them and made of them a Movement.The Original Pimps?

                                        The (obvious) fact that men are weak and flawed creatures does not change the fact that women, collectively, have become monsters in the modern West.That some weak men colluded in this is not news.  Like leftie men, conservative men just cannot stand to hear the truth spoken about female nature . . . gasp! not THEIR precious princess.  Mine is DIFFERENT. lolInstead, rightie men rush forward to exclaim that men were part-and-parcel in the creation of our Feminist Nation.  If we just disenfranchise and demean men and masculinity enough, well, that oughta solve the problem of our gyno-societies.  Right?  :O)

                                            That some weak men colluded in this is not news.“Some.” If only. We need to face the fact that weak men have been the rule a long time and that led directly to today’s disaster. Al is right in that a certain Tribe created the pathologies he listed, but they could have been checked if men from out groups had rediscovered their spine. I really enjoyed this yesterday from someone whose name rhymes:The Absence of Men :: SteynOnline.It is a willful absence, and that is acknowledged, but that piece is spot on. Whores and female sociopathy have been issues since we walked upright, but once men abrogated their roles as such the weaker sex took control. There is some indication that masculinity is reasserting itself, as should be expected, but the damage already done is irreparable.

                                To support that argument I point to the rest of the world and even the West a couple of centuries or so ago where marriages were “arranged” between families—the offspring having little to no say in the matter.  Seems to have worked in the main.

                                    While I don’t support totally ‘arranged’ marriages, and deplore marriages between close relatives as practiced in Pakistan and many Muslim countries, it used to be considered common sense to accept the counsel of one’s parents before committing to what used to be a life partner.  Whatever happened to the idea that one should marry someone from a ‘good family’?  (i.e. no alcoholism, drugs, violence, lots of divorce, etc.).  Of course, if the girl’smother is an airhead and/or slore and father is absent and/or considers his daughter a ‘princess,’run away.

                    It smacks a bit of“post hoc, ergo propter hoc” reasoning.

                    That’s excellent, Jeffrey, thanks. I haven’t read Unwin previously, but apparently based on the summary he doesn’t directly address the racial and r/k selection factors, which follows on from what is put forth in the link. Three generations into “sexual liberation,” it does appear his theory is playing out as the West collapses.

                I’ve been watching The Godfather trilogy which has been playing on Pluto for the past couple of months. I’ve seen it so many times, it’s comfortable background noise when I’m doing something else.But the thing that strikes me is that the most powerful and successful of the bunch, Vito Corleone, Michael Corleone, Tom Hagen and Peter Clemenza all kept it zipped. Vito was raised under traditional Italian Catholic morality and didn’t understand why you would want or need anything on the side. But the womanizers of the bunch (Sonny, Carlos and Fredo) weren’t quite as successful or lucky.For some reason, the subtle message of that part of the movie always resonated with me.

            The Turkics (who originated in Mongolia) were brought in as servants and slaves to the Arabs and Persians. The Abbasid-era Muslims trained them as soldiers, and they rose up and took over.
It sounds like the Muslims brought them in to pick their lettuce and do their lawns…

        The US economy is based on lies, deception and fraud.  A perfect example of this just happened.  The New Jersey supreme court just made a ruling that is so typical.  A couple was driving down the road and were t-boned by some alien driving for Uber Eats.  Apparently, their minor daughter had, at one time, ordered an Uber Eats.  By agreeing to the EULA, not only her, but all of her immediate relatives are forced into arbitration.This just happened with Disney too.  Someone signed up for a free trial of Disney plus years before visiting Disney World where they were killed by the food.  They were forced into arbitration from the Disney Plus app. But I think bad press got Disney to relent.  So much for the Seventh Amendment. No right to a jury trial if evilcorp decides you shouldn’t.This kind of bullshit is EVERYWHERE. It’s in automotive. It’s in housing. It’s in socks, if you can believe it.  Worse, these things are not really contracts.  The other side can change the contract at will without notification.  They send these updates from email addresses likely to be sent to spam.  If you serve boneless chicken and your customer is severely injured by chicken bones, that doesn’t count either.  The Ohio supreme court just ruled (TWICE) boneless chicken is actually a cooking style and not a description of chicken without bones.The online world is also based on fraud, lies and scams.Nobody will do anything about it.  We have reached the point the Soviets reached, at least in some respects.  The Soviet Union fell because it was incapable of reform. It could have been saved had the will been there.  We are at the same point. Nothing can be reformed. Not because reform is impossible, but because the will does not exist.

            I hope there is more to this and appeal to higher courts will establish such. There is no way we can have another, unauthorized individual, sign contracts for other parties without their knowledge or expressed consent. The law would collapse.When at the university many years ago, we began to experience such “contracts” via the shrink wrapped software we purchased for PC’s.  Everyone has seen such.  That’s when the software box is shrink wrapped and there is a sticker upon it that says “…removal and use of this software indicates agreement to the enclosed license.”  After some thought, the university lawyers said to ignore such as it violated “contract law”.  The university is a *very* conservative place when it comes to contracting.  I assume they were on to something.

        I wonder how long it is going to be before we start seeing slave markets in Homs.
The fact that the US supported this rebellion then immediately started bombing the rebels after they succeeded says it all. A book came out in 2005 named “Incoherent Empire”. I never read it but the name always stuck with me. Of course this incoherence comes because the US government feels obligated to support a rogue state in the region that works directly against American interests, but we can’t talk about that.

        Being a middle-aged white man with a family and a firearm, I think about collapse a lot.I can’t speak for Europe, but the USA’s collapse scenario might be:Cities will become warzones, and the warlords will be black. The test case was the CHAZ in Seattle in 2020. There will be African-levels of violence and pray for any pretty girl left behind.Rural and exurban areas will be better off, with communes or militias forming up. There will be scarcity, and death, but not a lot of violence. Hispanics and Whites may or may not cooperate. Best-case scenario will be “Old West” type living.The big X factor will be felons and homeless dogs. Unless you choose to remain in a city, 90% of your ammo will be spent shooting people’s rabid dogs. The other 10% will be strangers from the prisons or the cities.People in prison are at least as good at SHTF McGuyvering as rednecks are, and will survive better than others. Recent third-world immigrants will be better-prepared too, as they are used to “making do” with little.With all the unhealthy people, boomers, and otherwise useless people who can’t make or fix anything, it will be a bad time. They won’t last a year. This could be 200 million deaths easily.The good news is that even with a worse-case scenario like I outlined, I expect things to stabilize within 50 years. Births will be an issue, but if enough good human capital remains, it’s possible that daily life will revert to that resembling 16th-century Scotland.

            I no longer subscribe to the collapse scenario. Rather I see gradual decline, dissolution, and balkanization, with the creation of independent states the ultimate outcome. There will be some dislocation and misery, of course, but absolutely nothing like we’d see in a collapse scenario.

                It’s an internet tradition by now to link to wtfhappenedin1971.com to point out that the collapse already happened. If collapse means something like “economic immiseration of the people,” there it is (was). The American Dream was obliterated at about the same time the average Z Blog reader was born, and we are not young men. Things—the measurable things libertarians used to put on charts—have been made a lot worse for normal people since 2020, and nothing measurable suggests that themaking worsewill ever let up.I don’t have much use for measurable things (except in pointing out that nerds are stupid). I live in an unexceptional American city of, officially, above-average demographic quality. When I leave my house, America is not out there. The things I used to do can’t be done. Nothing works and everything is a scam. The white people who are supposedly 80% of my fellow citizens are nowhere to be seen.World War 3 is underway, unnamed. A dozen nations have already lost it, most recently Syria. We’ll forget it tomorrow and wonder when the war will start. Similarly, our apocalypse sits in our past, ignored (repressed).

                    That’s a good point. The fact that we use the term AINO in place of America indicates that something has already gone terribly wrong. But while the financial circumstances of the vast majority of AINO’s subjects are still quite tenable and even good, it is the culture around us that has utterly collapsed. America was a beautiful and admirable place. AINO is a disgusting pig sty. And that is because moral and aesthetic standards have been demolished.Still, when I speak of “collapse,” I mean a reduction of living standards to Third World levels, and that most assuredly has not happened. There remains enough physical infrastructure and human capital to sustain First World living standards for at least a few more decades. And I predict, as the country becomes evermore deranged, those who possess human capital–mainly whites–will carve out their own satrapies, which will form the basis of new nation-states.

                        “But while the financial circumstances of the vast majority of AINO’s subjects are still quite tenable and even good,”Hard for me to wrap my head around that.  Certainly, the economic status of folks commenting here resemble the elevated level of commentary—but I fear we are a small minority.Last a I read, a recent survey showed 60% the American family groups would have difficulty meeting an unexpected expense of $600.  These type of surveys are not a rarity.The median net worth of Americans in the 55-64 age group is around $200k. That means they will enter retirement with no resources other than SSI, which is intended to only meet 30-40% of retirement needs.  Since Biden’s election theft, the country is now 20% poorer due to inflation.I really think our American “wealth” is a Potemkin village of sorts.  But yes, living in a tent city in one of our public parks still beats living in a mud hut in Africa.   🙁

                        Yes. The Balkanization is underway even now. The internal migration is nothing short of breathtaking; it is, in fact, so extraordinary we have reduced it to background noise rather than deal with what it portends. The more valuable human capital has abandoned the cities already and that will expand to include the remnants of the working class who still are there. AINO’s citizenry remains materially the wealthiest (that is going away, as an aside) but it is indeed the quality of life that has utterly collapsed. The oil shock of 1971 pales in comparison to feminism and demographic change, both of which destroyed a once great nation.

                I don’t think we’ll collapse hard either….there would have to be a pretty awesome event like an asteroid or a global natural disaster for the world to revert to pre-industrial.The reason why a terrifying collapse (like Libya/Somalia/Syria) happens is because nobody has any real interest or investments in those countries. The USA is seriously tied up with the world’s fortunes, so we’ll get a strongman before we get a Syria. Russia or China would fall harder than even the cuckiest and softest Western country like Germany, because they are non-aligned and more or less on their own, and the smart set tends to choose the Germanies over the Chinas.

                “I no longer subscribe to the collapse scenario.”
I don’t, either. Not out of some naive doubt it could happen, but the company such thinking attracts. Aside from countless predictions that never come to fruition, too many wish for it to happen at the expense of ignoring nasty problems already present. “Not much I can do,” they say, except sit on the sidelines and piss and moan whilst wagging a finger. Be prepared, but FFS, live your life.

        The US may be “fragile”, but not all seems the same.  For one, we have a division of civic duties among the States and the Fed’s.  What did Syria have outside of a Federal government to assert order?  But perhaps most importantly, Syria is populated by low IQ Arabs enmeshed in a religion of “death”.  Healthy societies are not founded that way, especially after a successful revolution where factions were only held together by a common enemy.  Now that Assad is gone, the factions immediately turn upon each other.Of course, this seems all planned by the CIA.  The end being that a single great power will fill that chaotic vacuum and the exhausted populace welcome it.  I doubt it will ostensibly be the GAE, but whoever *they* are, they will be controlled by us from behind the scenes. Or at least the plan goes.

                Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like the Russians developed the Poseidon nuclear torpedoes to significantly reduce the amount of protection the oceans afford the US.
Of course, this perspective assumes that the Poseidon exists and functions as is rumored on the interwebs.

                ” . . . weak neighbors . . .”  Only to a point.  Those ‘weak’ Mexicans and central American Indios have been easily invading AINO for decades.  Barring organized cooperative violence and resolve on the part of Whites, the entire southwest will be indistinguishable socially and economically from their homelands in 50 years.  And in addition to our moronic welcome of all the subcons, they are streaming in through the northern border.  And that’s not even mentioning Hongcouver.  Unless/until air and sea travel vanishes, oceans are no protection whatsoever.

In addition to the factions you mention, AINO has a serious cartel infiltration problem.
Just think of how many politicians the cartels own on both sides of the border.
Law enforcement is even worse because they are infiltrated by cartel-affiliated gangs and actual cartel operatives. The LAPD and Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department are prime examples of this type of infiltration.

                        The cartels also recruit from the military and have infiltrated it to some degree. That is one of the lesser reasons the United States military is hot garbage now, but it is a factor.

            Syria never had an Islam problem. The crazies are imports, sponsored by Turkey and the United States. The human capital is a bit less than in North America, but it had substantial smart fraction. The Alawites look very European for a reason. Like Lebanon, a Syria left alone probably settles into something like Jordan, but with more tourism.

        “the result will be a war zone where lightly armed war bands fight with one another for control of increasingly worthless land”This is how Israel has wanted it, planned for it, and enacted it.  As I imagine most know, Zionist jews in the Pentagon developed a plan before 9/11 that the US would destroy the governments of Israel’s various perceived enemies, according to General Wesley Clark, “starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran”.  It seems like leaving each nation a Mad Max mess with no central government strong enough to field a coherent military able to stand up to Israel has been the goal.And they have now achieved it in all of the nations except for Iran, which still stands, despite assassinations ofQassem Soleimani andpossibly Ebrahim Raisi, and repeated color revolutions attempts.  This is of course why officials make constant ridiculous claims that mysterious USG drones flying over New Jersey, assassins attacking Trump and loosely affiliated with the CIA and DHS HSI, and the NSA hacking the Trump campaign emails are all Iranian attacks.  They want the American public riled up and angry so that that we will support the US doing Israel’s work and trying to topple that final nation’s central government, also leaving it a chaotic violent impotent failed-state mess.

Brilliant. Brilliant. That’s it.That’s their strategy for the entire world. That’s why they sow discord everywhere; as the Zman pointed out, as a permanent minority cohered by well-earned paranoia, they then rule with ruthless suppression.
This was WW1, WW2, and will be WW3. WW1 and 2 vaulted them to global power, meaning WW3 – by war, by pandemic, by attacking the food supply, by financial collapse – WW3 must happen.

        The world is clearly moving toward something vaguely along the lines forseen by Huntington.  The question is will clash be inevitable.
Maybe Trump is thinking about a new Big Three or Four Policeman arrangement with himself, Xi, Modi, maybe Putin.
Extending and invitation to Xi to attend the innaugural is simultaneously intriguing, hilarious and shrewd.  As would be an invitation to Putin, which would have the added benefit of reducing the “foreign policy community” by half through strokes and heart attacks.

            The problem is China has a lot of the same problems the US has, only worse.  China has a corruption problem that makes America look like a utopia in comparison.  Chinese soldiers removed the liquid fuel from rockets to cook with and replaced the fuel with water.  The food system is so corrupt that the CCP has its own farms run by and for the party to supply party members with high quality food.  China has a problem with gutter oil. Used cooking oil literally sucked out of gutters, “filtered and treated” and sold again as new.   A big scandal just happened where oil trucks carrying cooking oil were carrying kerosene and coal oil and then being filled with cooking oil without cleaning. They will literally spray paint shell fish or pigs.  They even fake rice.The real estate bubble collapse is slowly wrecking the economy.

            Huntington already has been validated by the conflicts with the Muslim world, and the clash underway with Russia also lines up with his view of Orthodoxy as being in conflict with what was formerly Christendom. The man was a prophet but said things that required him to be unpersoned

        The hardest truth is that a collapse is often the only cure for what ails us. An addict must hit a hard bottom if he is to have any chance at redemption. That is nature’s eternal lesson. Normie will not get off the couch until he must do so or die. Hunger is the seminal motivator. Parasites cannot be rehabilitated. You are either strong, smart, and productive, or the gene pool has no use for you. And as for the Syrian example, let’s see how well a creative narrative, woke indoctrination, and pissing &amp; moaning survives in that environment.

        Alex Krainer is one of the sharpest geo-political minds on the internet. He is also very aware of historical precedence, something which seems to elude Americans. In this interview, his informed opinion is quite different from all the journalist jibber-jabber we’ve been hearing. He believes the Russians and Iranians decided some time ago to simply invite chaos into Syria as a way of finally defeating the West. In other words, they’ve sprung a trap. His argument is compelling. Listen carefully and listen to all of it…

                I heard it floated that Putin made a deal to trade Syria for Ukraine. I wouldn’t necessarily think so much about that, time will tell in any case, but just this week none other than ABC News came out and said on air that 1 million Ukrainian soldiers have died in the war.

                There are any number of explanations, but in that part of the world there are no simple explanations. Today’s friend is tomorrow’s enemy in the Mideast. Russia and Iran can afford to wait and see what develops. And Turkey may have now created a nasty neighbor right on its border. Israel, more so. Neither Russia nor Iran share a border with Syria.

                    I had watched that interview with Alex Krainer when it came out. I wasn’t convinced. I don’t see how it can benefit Russia or Iran compared to the status quo ante in Syria. I also watched an interview with Brian Berletic at the Danny Haiphong channel a few days after that interview and Brian didn’t seem to think the theory holds water either.
It mightpossiblybenefit Russia and Iran as the chaos unfolds and provided the collective West overreaches but not as some kind of  3-D chess master move planned well in advance. Sorry, just don’t buy it.

                        As Krainer stated, how do these regime change antics work out for the US? They are all expensive failures, the latest being Afghanistan (and Libya and Iraq before that). All the low hanging Sykes-Picot fruit is gone. Think “sustainability”. Israel’s position as an Anglo-American catspaw for the Mackinder Project continues to get more perilous. Ukraine is part of that project and the Russians have won there. Now what?

                            You raise some good points and some I’m scratching my head over. For example, I have trouble thinking of Israel as being an Anglo-American catspaw. It seems to me to be the reverse. Regardless, it’s an unhealthy relationship.When you mention the “Mackinder project” my brain just hurts. It seems to me that the Mackinder project in practice is an all-purpose mind-virus deliberately injected into the consciousness of Western elites to advance the local agendas of an interlocking web of criminal cartels in the rest of the world. America becomes a little more despotic and more diminished as this mind-virus advances. This mind-virus is precisely what the Russians mean when they talk of an existential threat.Is the Middle East even part of the Mackinder project as it was originally understood? ZOG may twist facts to make it seem so, but they have their own agenda and so now we have “Syria.” I have my own opinion about this, that it is dual-purpose, in part to advance the aforesaid agenda of Greater Israel and in part to refocus Trump away from his domestic agenda.

        The collapse of the Soviet Union, of Kuomintang China, of Syria, of East Germany, all have as the main cause the lack of payment, regular and loyalty buying, of the soldiers and police.This is the lesson. Above all in a modern, semi-industrial society, the police and soldiers must be well paid to retain their loyalty.The same can likely be said of Saigon.By contrast, the HST, the Taliban, the NVA, etc. are not or were not paid much at all or irregularly paid in the case of the NVA. They fought for a cause, based on national, or Tribal (even more powerful) loyalty.With all the technology, all the clever hacking tricks, it still comes down to the amount of men sufficiently motivated with rifles to take and hold ground while taking casualties.I would ask, who will fight and die for Justin Trudeau without ample pay and opportunities relatively risk free, for cruelty and domination of their fellow citizens? Or for Starmer? Or Macron? The answer is of course no one. The same holds true for Obama btw if he somehow schemes with Alvin Bragg and Judge Merchan, or Fani Willis, to imprison Trump before he takes office and stages some South Korean auto-coup. Fujimori style, so to speak.

            The oligarchy that is (optimistically) openly allied with Trump, or (pessimistically) controlling him, will not permit a coup against him (at least not anytime soon), just as they did not permit the election to be stolen this time around. Although I’m open to the probability that a couple of down ballot races were allowed to be stolen. It’s a curious statistical anomaly that the late counted ballots always favor the D candidate, who may or may not end up pulling ahead, yet win or lose, every single time, Every Single Time, Every Single Damned Time, the late counted ballots always favor the D. What are the odds?Anyhow, as for the cops and soldiers being paid, it’s not necessarily an immediate abandonment of their posts if they aren’t. If I recall correctly re: the USSR, it was a year or 2 after the paychecks stopped coming before they deserted. In AINO, which is more capitalist, mercenary, and all about the benjamins, they could be expected to desert sooner. My guess is it would only take a couple of months.

        Notice that Israel is occupying a lot of former Syrian land.   This will continue and expand.    The media will be showing the head choppers in action and this will justify the occupation as Israel will be “protecting” itself.So we are financing the greater Israel project.   I liked the photos in the Syrian government buildings with the pallets of U.S. currency.   The pallets had a QR code that shows the origin as the NY Federal Reserve.     They don’t even try to hide it anymore.It was funny to see Trump, while all of this is going on, exclaim that “We should stay of the conflict in Syria.”   The man is too daft for words.

        The Order of the Garter is the oldest English knight order, established in 1348 by Edward III when, at a ball, he noticed a lady losing her garter on the floor.
As he picked it up and offered it back to her, he noticed his court smirking lewdly and said: “Honi soit qui mal y pense” – “shame on he who thinks ill thereof”, the motto of the knights.

        It would be like them to time their planned demolition of the stock market to coincide with Trump’s ringing the bell. But that is only an economic collapse, we’ve seen those before. GD 1.0 strengthened the regime. (or was the panic of 1873 GD 1.0? and the crash of 1929 GD 2.0? making the next one GD 3.0? and where does 2008 fit into that timeline?). Anyhow, that’s illustrative that there can be a lot of collapses, economically, without any of them having to be “final.” Nor do they need to weaken the state. As we have seen, they can and have been justification for expansion of state power.An imperial collapse of the GAE would most likely begin at the fringes, to include Europe. And even though Europe has already collapsed culturally (non-reproduction, churches become museums, imported replacements proliferating, decadence the highest aspiration of the populace), structurally and economically it is still there. The WEF kids still in charge (if Macron, Castreau, and Starmer switched places, would anyone notice the difference?). So my collapse alarm bells are not yet ringing. It pays to remember that in dissident circles, talk of collapse is often wishful thinking.

        The one economist who predicted the Soviet collapse was Judy Shelton with 1989’s “The Coming Soviet Crash: Gorbachev’s Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets.” She examined Soviet balance sheets and found them unsustainable. Trump appointed her to the Federal Reserve Board in 2019, but the Senate stalled her appointment and in Feb. 2021 Biden withdrew it. A warning of our collapse?

        A strategic retreat from runaway globalism would do a lot of good in the US.  But some sort of purge is going to be necessary.  Not necessarily guillotine purges, but certainly something that exiles people from access to power permanently is necessary.
4 years is a blink of an eye.  But 12 years?  We could wipe them out if Trump does a good job with Vance.

        The Israeli-backed, Turkish-paid “moderate Islamists” who’ve taken over Syria are an interesting phenomenon. Mark Collett sheds light on this in ashort video. The evolution of these Islamic insurgents resembles that of the Serbian nationalist Black Hand organization, which in 1914 existed primarily as an asset of Serbian military intelligence.

                Mr. Derbyshire’s well-known philosemitism is fortunately less consequential than the Western leaders who are in complete thrall to it. That and the fact that most Israeli politicians make 1910s Serb militarists look moderate by comparison.

        Probably the most spectacular “collapse” known to us is the fall of the Aztec Empire to a band of 100 or so Spanish ruffians with gold on their mind. Or – similarly – Pizarro’s conquest of the Incas. We’re talking not only collapse, but revolution in the lives of the unhappy inhabitants of those empires and the economies they served. From agrarian peasants, to Potosi mining slaves in one lifetime.
Lesson: It sucks to be weak.

        “You can’t get the new order until the old one collapses.”Yes. However, in post-America there is a willful and highly organized project of controlled demolition happening.Very powerful and organized networks and institutions are willfully executing a controlled demolition of the carcass of America. Clinton was pushing for it 30+ years ago. Petreaus and other generals have been advocating for it explicitly for nearly 25 years.The point? Well, it is quite possible that what we think of as The Regime being incompetent and dying is not what it is. It is a misreading or a cope. Maybe what is happening now is that a second faction is jockeying for control.Both factions are fully on board with Liberal Democracy as a system. “Dissidents”, will be out in the wilderness for a long time. Best they not think of themselves as Dissidents but the architects of the system that they can clearly articulate and describe amongst themselves. This vision must be expressed in positive terms, not negative terms. Then rather than political dissidence the project becomes … …Millions of American Remus and Romuluses suckling at the teet of the wolf in a self-civilizing wilderness.

                It’s a great movie if you’re into German film, which is to say gloomy and intense.I visited East Germany right after the Wall fell and it really was like that: run-down, falling apart, towns smelly and grimy with lignite smoke, empty shops, ridiculous cars, surly people, shitty, lukewarm beer, excellent vodka, strong John le Carré-vibesWhen it came out, the movie sparked a wave of Ostalgia, nostalgia for the East, from old Ossies who’d seen their children being stripped of all culture and inner life and have it replaced with vapid Hollywood movies, porn, consumerism and anomie.A bit weird, considering how bleak the movie is, especially considering that we’re shown the lives of the Commie cadres; the working class didn’t have all the cool stuff like record players and Western magazines.

Back in the day, early 60’s, folks promoted getting rid of substandard housing and built the poor folks new, high rise, apartments.  See, if you had a new apartment, you’d be turned into an upstanding American citizen, every cause of social decay being due to some sort of economic disparity—capitalist Marxism.They destroyed the soul of the poor neighborhoods and concentrated crime and dysfunction into an even smaller area.  Took 20+ years to realize our mistake and blow the damn things up, but there was really no return to the past as they had already bulldozed the old neighborhoods.The solution now is to “spread the wealth” through “Section 8” housing vouchers and “single family” zoning reform—coming to a neighborhood near you.   🙁

        “Of course, once you start thinking about those conditions, the West begins to look a bit fragile.”
Merely a question of time. There were war bands in the aftermath of the collapse of the western part of the Roman empire. In the USA I would guess the collapse into roving war bands will be initially along the southern border.

        I think the collapse you want to look out for is the collapse of the dollar. That could lead to the new American revolution

        Question for next week: A while back you mentioned you had been reading a biography of Bukharin. What was the title and author of that book, and would you recommend it? I have been interested in learning more about him and his relationship with Stalin for some time. Or you can send this to me offline. Thanks!!
