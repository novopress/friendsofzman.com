        Perhaps other intelligent species aren’t broadcasting their presence for the same reason that deer and rabbits don’t roar or howl at the moon – there are predators.

            I think that is called the ‘Hunters of the Dawn’ theory.  As civilizations rise and begin to emit RF noise, xenophobic alien races immediately dispatch a planet killer; a comet,  a black hole, or democrats…

        Yes, we are functionally alone so all this back and forth is an exercise in futility. The real issue for me is our space program (and the lack of it).We would have already have had an American presence on Mars if it weren’t for all the social programs (“Great Society”, 46 million on food stamps),  Wilson and  FDR setting the stage for Statism (not to mention Communism), trillions spent on wars lost by Democrats beginning with Korea (actually Yalta. Thanks for that Harry Hopkins and FDR) and all the other pernicious bullshit the statist Left has foisted upon us.We put men on the moon in 1969 after the first powered flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 with computational power in the Apollo capsule less than what we have in a Casio watch today. Even with the dramatically scaled-back Mars Rover missions those two little beasts are still churning out photos and other data including mining results (imagine that: mining on Mars…). For God’s sake, we even went to Pluto.Today we can’t get to the ISS without hitching rides with the friggin’ Russians thanks to these woefully misplaced priorities. Just think of all the damn jobs and economic insulin the space program alone would have injected into our economy (not to mention the civic pride all over our great country). We would long ago have established a permanent colony on the Moon as a jump-off point to the Red Planet (and scared the shit out of our enemies to boot).The “Long March” by the Frankfort School, like Sherman driving through Atlanta, has eviscerated the heart and soul of our great land. It’s long past time we take some of that surrendered ground back from these parasites. Screw the SETI freaks and the Hussein-odered NASA outreach to the Dirt Worshippers and affirmative action hires.Let’s clean house at NASA, order them to take a look back at it’s proud history and hire some people to do just that.If congress won’t do it with Trump as POTUS, well than, there’s always executive orders. After all, Chocolate Jesus has already blazed that trail with a flame-thrower. Trump would just be following a proud Democrat tradition.

            The space program WAS a socialist program. By the time it hit middle age it was already moribund, and all it did well was to prevent the entry of private enterprise into space. Then old age sank it to lower lows until The One hisself put it out of it’s misery. Curious how we wind up cheering for the wrong side because the enemy has crossed the fence and confused the boundaries.

                james wilson – I think you’re right. War socialism was the space program’s foundation when it was a race with a deadly rival. Absent that, it has slowly decayed. Collective salvation is an illusion.

        Some believe the reason the cosmos are so quiet is because the noisy chick gets eaten. Any cosmic civilization will eventually become a danger to others around it.  Thus any artificial radio communications are either a potential danger or a trap to lure somebody into revealing their position.
Once you know the position of the ‘enemy’ you can simply destroy their planet with a big enough rock. We know how and we’ve barely left our planet.

            Well, if most information just is perceived as background radiation, and stray neutrinos, then perhaps radiological mutation is just getting shit together.   I do not know why organic life would not be a small fish in a really big sea.

        Another great read.  I find the desperate search for other life and other planets most passionate in folks that are anti-religion and/or Christianity.  They are agnostic or athiest, seems, but are determined to find other life, as that validates their view of humans on Earth, the special-ness of Earth, and humans.  Much like internationalists within the US are bound and determined to make sure no one thinks the US is a very special country as formed , and must be shown to be not so special and even unfairly prosperous.  I could be wrong, but that’s how I see it.My favorite quote about the heavens and stars, etc, was…  that God put them there, for us to look at , and feel the enormity of it all… but…   there’s nothing else out there.  We’re a one-off thing.   And that’s a good thing.  Not a bad thing.

        How have humans changed from 200k years ago?  Physically they are pretty much the same (lighter bones and teeth now) but something catalyzed our cognitive abilities about 10k years ago.  That is the key to the big riddle, I think.

            I was mostly thinking about cognitive skills, but we have changed physically. Think about it. In a short time, we developed variation in eye and hair color. The epicanthic fold is what? 50K years ago?
A million more years of evolution and we will look very different and have vastly different cognitive abilities. Or, we could die out entirely. That may be the reality of the universe.

        I believe the “universe” is holographic and recommend the late David Bohm’s “Wholeness and the Implicate Order” to anyone interested in the assumption. I’m also a nearly unconditionally convinced Zen practitioner and for anyone with an interest in how that relates to the holographic universe, reading “The Zen Teachings of Huang Po” is sufficient.

        Even assuming we can build a vehicle to reach something close to light speed, we’re still looking at having geezers showing up to the alien planet…..
Not so as the closer you travel to the speed of light the more time slows down so the astronauts on the spaceship would still be young but their  twin siblings on Earth would  be geezers.
I grew up in the 1970s and remember predictions that we would have a manned base on Mars by 2014….

        Not only are we alone in the universe, but if we continue searching the cosmos looking for and hoping to find “alien beings” or “life” like ours, we will go mad. (http://jlepore.fineartstudioonline.com/blog/95417/that-way-lies-madness).
The real journey is inward, into the depths of our own individual minds, hearts and souls.

            random observer 2011New commenter here. Thanks for the link to your site- I’m just starting to work through your recent stuff. Some I haven’t really gotten but “Dancing with the Devil” and “The Last White Male” are quite provocative. Good use of the ‘really short’ story form. Spare, but generates strong mental imagery.On the subject of the moment, I did read “That way lies madness”. Would you care to elaborate on your point? I didn’t quite click with it but this is a subject of interest for me. The immensity of the universe is one of those things that seems to awe or frighten humans, or only occasionally both. Arguably, endlessness is actually more awesome/frightening than mere finite immensity, but given how immense even a finite universe must be, I wonder how much it matters.For what its worth, your presentation of the question briefly made me imagine having a cosmological dialogue with Lovecraft. That’s meant as high praise.

                I first started thinking about the futility of looking for an answer in the cosmos when I saw 2001, A Space Odyssey, circa 1972. My point in That Way Lies Madness was the same as ( in my view) was made in the movie and the novel: you will go mad if you search for meaning as a separate thing unto itself, God, if you will, as a big powerful thing at the edge of the universe. I am still groping at this, but my heart tells me the search for God in an interior one. The very idea of infinity must of necessity drive us to look inward. We go insane if we try to grasp the ungraspable.I find it not easy to accept such high praise as your comparison to Lovecraft, except of course to say thank you. Your mention of dialogue is very interesting to me, as I believe dialogue is the heart of the matter, so to speak, in all good fiction. I have a project in mind of writing a short novel all in dialogue. There’s something about how we talk to each other that gets my heart racing.PS Keep reading Zman. You will not be disappointed.

                    The search for meaning, for G_d, IS the purpose.  Its not about arriving somewhere, its about the journey – to nowhere.  If you do ‘arrive’ you likely find you are back at your beginning yet you know the place for the first time.  Sentient life – to me this is self evident – is a mechanism whereby the cosmos has a sense of self experience. Yet, G_d does not exist. Impossible. He is eternal.  Only things have existence. Its all an illusion, people. “Born, I cannot die. Dead, I cannot be born.” We little ants are the means to overcome that limitation of the infinite.

                    Thanks for this reply.I’m working my way through our host’s archives. Not disappointed yet. Depressed, occasionally.Your elaboration was clarifying for me. I would tend to agree, though I’m not sure the inner exploration will necessarily be more fruitful in the end, nor less maddening as we find meaning ungraspable therein as well. Either way, you gave me a further point worth thinking about- I have never really thought of the desire for space exploration as, or at least not entirely as, the quest for meaning or the search for God. For wealth and power, for species long-term survival, or at its best for knowledge, sure. ‘Meaning’ I never really thought of as more than a supporting element of it, to the degree that some level of meaning can be a consequence  of gaining knowledge. In retrospect, that seems an almost-autistic level gap in my approach to the issue.I wonder if it is a marker of my being a member of the Star Trek generation rather than the 2001 generation, and/or, being of too materialist a mindset. Space exploration has struck me as a quest for secular knowledge first, limited by the weakness of our technology and physical capacity perhaps forever or perhaps only for the time being, but on some level already reduced to a material problem even if big leaps remain on hold indefinitely. It is not that I cannot quite understand the idea of a spiritual quest, rather that I didn’t see space as being that, or only that.That also gives me another way to think about a separate question. I have yet to read CS Lewis’ space trilogy. I remember once reading that a large part of his point was that the quest for knowledge of space, or at least the quest to get man out into it, was an inherently demonic pursuit. Presumably in the sense of being a marker of our discontent with Eden. I admit to still struggling with the implications of that worldview.At any rate, still also working through your fiction archives. Still being struck by their brevity and imagery. Thanks for your ongoing work.

        If Einstein rules, the speed of light is an interstellar stop sign. But if he was only as right as, say, Issac Newton, we may be a hot venue on the interstellar tourist map right now. Surely this place is more interesting than a zoo. Until the day comes that somebody explains spooky action at a distance, nobody even knows what’s impossible.

        Aliens are flying above our head as we speak. Unfortunately, due to a galactic design flaw, their spacecraft look like clouds.
Of course, they don’t want to let us know they exist in any event because, you know, that immigrant thing.

            Naw! The aliens are a most helpful bunch. I caught a glimpse of a title of one of their book-length essays.
It was called “To Serve Mankind”.
Okay, okay!  Credit to Rod Serling and his crew.

        “around the year 62,899. Our astronauts would not even be dust at that point.”That brought home for me the genius of nature.Nested, encoded information endures, even in transitory vessels such as ourselves.Big fan of Steven Baxter SF scenarios of the sturdy primate form extending 10, 30, 500 million years in the future.I remember an old story wherein the alien progenitors had stored star tech in beetle DNA, beetles haven’t changed in an absurdly long time.Also agree with Bruce Sterling that the best way to colonize space would be rock-hopping the rubble of the Oort cloud, where it intersects with Alpha Centauri’s Oort cloud.  Given geological time scales, we could spread widely across some millions of years.For a delicious story in that vein, see the terrible fate of far future pirates in “Guest Law”, Asimov’s SF magazine 1994?  Earth is long forgotten, centripetal gravity at the rate of 62 feet per second per second is a formula from the ancient mysteries.One frightening thought: the life cycle of ant colonies, a twenty year cycle of colonization ending in genocide, has persisted for 200 million years.  Can the worst of human social instincts ever change?Hey! What happened to HBDChick on the blogroll!

            Plus, I dream of a time when all that remains of Earth’s lost history is found in an ancient derelict: copies of two hero stories, “Conan the Barbarian” and “Conan the Destroyer”.

        &gt;&gt; Then you have the evolutionary issues. Humans today are nothing like the humans of 200,000 years ago. Imagine what we will be like in 200,000 years.All evidence indicates that humans are finished evolving, at least in any sort of meaningfully positive way. Existing technology has all but conquered the environment, eliminating they type of competitive adaptation pressures which caused the species to evolve. Population growth is now dysgenic rather than eugenic and average IQs are falling. Most humans of the future are quite likely to be dumber than most humans of the present, hence Idiocracy.Competitive adaptation of the human species may resume if we lose the race between bacteria and antibiotics or in response to a viral epidemic. HIV would have wiped out much of the population of Africa had the West not intervened. The population of Africa was approximately 475 million in 1980; it is 1.2 billion today and will double in the next 10-15 years. I am not a young man and I fully expect to see Western Europe become majority African in my lifetime.

            “Population growth is now dysgenic rather than eugenic and average IQs are falling”Dysgenic versus eugenic population growth may be the only thing that can keep humans alive as a species for a million years. On the other hand, Hinduism claims humans have existed for millions of years already.

            Ol’ Art was partially right. To be more accurate, it should read, “any  developed technology is magic.”
The first atlatl which killed a deer from 30 yards was “magic” to a Neanderthal. So does one consider a notched stick to be “sufficiently developed technology?”
