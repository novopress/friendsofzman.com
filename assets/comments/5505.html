        There is another kind of bust out Henry.The kind that comes from cold anger, smoldering cold anger.The kind of bust out when people understand there is no longer any viable recourse and they are disgusted beyond words by the wonton treason against their most primal dignity of liberty and prosperity.“It is time to shoot the sonofabitches”.It is not a comment I’m hearing. It is not boast or braggado or idle bullshit. It is a statement of resigned inevitability. Of ugly cold brutal truth. That’s another kind of bust out right there in its own right.The arrogant disregard of flyover country, excuse me, the “unsecured spaces”, add in a dash of insult and threats like white right wing extremism, domestic tea party bitter clinger terrorist, white privilege, all the pejorative cultural marxist bullshit and lies, a helping of obviously false flag and crisis as a means events, pat convenient narratives come to life, and that cold anger is as hard and frigid as dry ice.Here is the thing Henry, (and you peeping fucking perverts spying on us reading this), that cold anger, it has guns. A lot of guns. And not because that cold anger wants to bust out, or shoot the sonofabitches, but exactly because it doesn’t. It is the last thing that cold anger wants to do. Better to suffer the indignities and transgressions, with quiet dignity and courage, until the bitter end, than let the beast loose.That is a terrible thing. It is a beast best not awakened. A beast that understands in its bones the very nature of the elites running things, the scope of the lawless disregard for the rule of law expanding exponentially by the day by the very nature of corruption of the elites lust to acquire and retain absolute power.Its not a difficult thing to grasp. Greed and selfishness and the arrogance of those running things, and the threat of and use of force and violence is government. It doesn’t even need to be expressed or put into words. It is not necessary. Because it is cultural perception. It is primal. No less so, even more so, are certain primal aspects of liberty. And the beast and its cold anger is by it’s very nature discreetly a polite taboo. You know it’s there. You know others know it’s there. That is right there an acknowledgment, an affirmation of something terrible if it is let loose. Good people are good people because they got some reservation in them, they got a kind of grace and tolerance, that they aint savages, they see the savages in brooks brothers suits, this thing, this plurality, its a glue that holds this Gotterobammerung of a country together in spite of the fuckers enriching themselves at the expense of the very ones they despise.Oh ya, is it time to shoot the politicians?Hard to say.There is a kind of inevitability to it regardless.And that makes what is in the wind even more terrible.

        […] have a ruling class that despises the people and nation over whom it rules,” writes blogger ZMan. That’s the pessimistic take, anyway. Let me just end with a bit of advice frequently […]

        Speaking of the backstabbing traitors in the GOP Establishment, I think they are preparing a big middle finger for vulgarians that  dare vote in the primaries.  If it starts to look like Trump is indeed going to win the nomination, I predict that Ryan and his fellow crooks pass a big amnesty with the help of Democrats to show the little people who’s boss.  “Ha, ha, rubes! Vote for Trump if you want but he can’t do anything about immigration anymore even if he gets elected!”.

        Universal suffrage is the center of gravity. You can bend, twist, or crawl any way you like, but gravity remains is the same and it is relentless. Until events, if they ever do, wipe out that odious institution, optimism is cowardice.

        Mokita, Mr. Z, Mokita. This essay is a prime example of why people read you avidly, and why you will never ever be quoted by mainstream scribblers. Tim
