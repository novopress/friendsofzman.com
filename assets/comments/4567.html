        My mother-in-law has dementia. Her quality of life is sinking and with it she is losing the last shreds of dignity. A couple of years ago, she was kept alive by medical intervention (free at point of delivery here in the UK but anything but free in the system of taxes we have) when it might have been kinder to allow her to slip away before she got to the point of not recognising her children but thinking a stuffed toy is going to go to ballet school. Harmless, maybe, but she needs care and it won’t get any better.I have no idea if we ever shalll have the will to face up to the problems of elderly people in the western world, and whether we might stop the medical interventions at some stage when ‘experts’ declare it not worth stepping in to save a life. Who those so-called experts might be, how they are appointed, who they answer to are huge questions. Most people know of instances of doctors who ‘allow’ the patient to overdose on some drug and slide away, but it isn’t a subject that is going to be aired in public.We have, as many of us know, a dishonest society because it will not face the issues that eventually affect us all. I am just not sure, as I say, that anyone will raise the issue anytime soon.

        You have terrible medical care, abusive even.Here in Ohio, about one week before my semi-annual exam, I go to the local hospital, and they draw a blood sample and run the tests requested by my physician. This takes about 30 minutes total in the hospital. On the way home I get a paper and some donuts.I go to the physician, who has the blood results, and I see him. A nurse (RN) weighs me (too high) and takes my blood pressure. 5 minutes. The doctor shows up, retakes the blood pressure (always lower and normal the second time, nurses are scary), and discusses my test results. Some banter about stuff ensues. This takes another 30 minutes total. Another paper and more donuts.Recently, the local hospital has been buying up private practices (my doctor’s included), and the affected physicians have become employees of the hospital. This has actually streamlined stuff somewhat because there is a common database for all my exams, test results and prescriptions. I suppose this new system will evolve into a UK/Canadian style horror show, but I am old enough to likely escape that.By the way, my eldest daughter has lived in Germany for more than 15 years and is a big fan of the German system.

        They know perfectly well that 60% of all health care dollars are sunk into the last year of life. There is a place hidden in their duplicitous minds which covets that pile of trillions and the power it will bring to the lords of Obamacare. There is no self-correcting mechanism in government, quite the contrary. The more wreckage it brings the more power they will have.

        Ah, but veterinarians have an unfair advantage. If M.D.s could euthanize any of their patients that present too big a burden of time or trouble, or even if they simply botched a procedure, costs for care would decline, not so?

            That’s a familiar counter, but reality is much different. Most pet owners spend enormous amounts on their pets, including end of life care. We put down our pets when they are suffering and no more can be done. For humans, we used to just administer pain killers and let the poor soul fade on. There’s no reason to not do that again and it is coming back in fashion. In Europe where the cost of the health care system is crushing them, the state is now pulling the plug on the old and feeble.
There’s no escaping reality.

                That’s OK so long as the old and feeble get to give the green light. I’d as soon not have the state (read: some bureaucrat with a degree in black and gender studies) pull my plug. (My plug is likely to get pulled before the decade ends according to the life expectancy tables, so I have some skin in the game).

                    That’s the big issue when it comes to government run health care. They ultimately get the final say and that means we are subjects of the bureaucracy in the end – literally. But it is also why these schemes will collapse.
