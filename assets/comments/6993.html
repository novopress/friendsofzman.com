        I suspect the day is just around the corner when my GPS turns me in for a speeding violation. My smartphone app dings on my phone to alert me they just booked 50-Euros off my bank account for the infraction. – “Have a nice day and drive safely!”

            I drive a Toyota that’s old enough to be entirely mechanical; no digital anything.  I suppose they can track me by the rumbling sound the exhaust manifold makes, but I don’t go anyplace that’s all that interesting.

        Ya, and the IRS doesn’t know a thing about the trillions in tax evasion in evolved in the Panama Papers. Like trillions and the sources of it exists in a vacuum, like it never existed. Lord forbid you mess up by 50 bucks on your return, lord love a duck. How insane does it have to be before we revolt?Well the fuckers had to steal it all from real sources that created that wealth to begin with. The only place real wealth comes from is by sweat and tears. That is tangible wealth, they wouldn’t be squirreling it away if it didn’t have intrinsic real value. Then they fill the vacuum with fiat and re-sell it back, then tax it again, and again, and…wtf?That is what the dirt people are for, to pay for the world these sonofabitches skate on paying for. It is nothing less than being screwed twice. They see us as chattel. The scope of criminality and wonton lust is beyond comprehension.Let it burn.Burn all to ashes, salt the earth.The dirt people re-inherent the Earth.It really can’t happen quickly enough.

        The future will suck for those who like to think their thoughts in private, and notice things.  Most people will have no problem with it, and lots of folks — probably a majority — will like it.  That was the true horror of Brave New World, and especially 1984 — Big Brother essentially left the proles alone, because machine-produced songs, novels, and feelie films were enough to keep them sedated.  Those of us who find that prospect horrifying have always been in a minority; it’ll just be illegal now, instead of merely socially disapproved.

        I get the feeling the surveillance state will only look at the little guys, at least the ones not doing much. The big fish and the fat cats will somehow remain anonymous, or they are coated in transparent gel so the camera sees through them as if they weren’t there. But then the problem with surveillance is who will do anything about what they see?Near me there is a housing estate (I think you call them projects in the States, but I may be wrong) and it has a fair number of unemployed people who are paid by the state to not make trouble. One of the things the unemployed do is to buy off-road bikes, unregistered for road use, and ride them around openly on the streets any way they want and occasionally diverting to a large field where they can rip the crops up by doing ‘stunts’ on their noisy bikes. You can hear them in the distance, revving up and roaring off to terrify rabbits and small birds on some otherwise pleasant patch of land. The CCTV of course won’t see them, and even if it did, who is going to do anything?Now if the revving scum boast about their awful habits on fecesbook there is a chance the fuzz will catch them. But I am not holding my breath on that one.I do understand of course that talking about this on this blog will tick an electronic box somewhere. From that, maybe Gargoyle or whatever it is called will fund the police to restore law and order. We shall see.

                Back in my barrio days, a couple of the kids on my block had what we called mini bikes.  But it was just one or two kids squirting from driveway to driveway, hoping not to get caught by the cops.
From all the burned out buildings, Baltimore is trying to catch up with Detroit to see who will be the first city to be designated a National Forest.

            Like UKer says, a public show is made of arrests and prosecutions of small-timers and cat-burglars.  How many of the black rioters in the UK several years ago were hunted down and prosecuted using surveillance footage?  These stories of arrests of small-timers using surveillance help shore up the illusion of state competency and control.  The reality is that, like Baltimore and Detroit, the state is helpless against large numbers of criminals and would be helpless against large numbers of citizens who revolted.  Recall several years ago the LAPD and surrounding agencies mobilized roughly 10,000 to hunt down a fired black cop who shot an officer.  They don’t have enough people to mobilize if 1000 to 10,000 start to rebel.The state is weakening, not strengthening.

        Banning cash will be like forced collectivization back in the Soviet Union.But instead of collective farms, too big to fail banks will manage it all.We will no longer really own anything, because:“When you deposit funds in a bank account, those funds are no longer yours. You become an unsecured creditor, or lender, to the bank. Many people mistakenly believe that their account balance shows how much they own. This is not so. Instead, it shows what the bank owes you. You merely hold a claim on cash.”viaTrue ownership will be once again confined to the managerial nobility.

        It’s here.  Funny, but a couple years before the NSA shit hit the fan, happened to be at conference where Jacob Applebaum (one of the key Tor developers) took the retired CIO of the NSA to task for all the warrantless info they had clearly harvested from him over the years.  It got nasty.  Later ended up signing next to him at lunch and his comment was “we’ve arrived at turn key totalitarianism, they are just using people like me for,the beta test”.

        As several folks have pointed out, the corruption doesn’t go away.  The minimum bet just gets higher.  Instead of setting up a shell company to launder your money, now you’ll have to pay a tech in someplace like Nigeria or Pakistan to alter the transaction history.  Except you don’t pay a tech because the Cartels or Al Qaeda or some other crime organization muscles their way in and taxes the transaction.  Or maybe you set up a criminal SIPRNET with no physical layer connection to the rest of the Internet.  Lord knows there is probably enough dark fiber out there, even in the undersea cables.For the rest of us, maybe we pay a percentage to a trusted operator to convert some of our e-money to scrip.  You walk down to the neighborhood 7-11, pay $100 bucks for an item that really doesn’t exist and get $90 in scrip back, which you can now use to buy some reefer or a lap dance.  Isn’t that how it works in Argentina, Venezuela, and other Tercero Mundo hellholes?  As soon as you get a Pendejo or a Chingaso or whatever they call their worthless currency, you sprint down to the corner money changer and exchange the depreciating-by-the-second crap for dollars.

            That reminds me of the food stamp scam someone talked about (might have been Kevin Williamson and I believe it was in Kentucky).  People would trade food stamps for soda and that was used as currency.

                Turning EBT cards into cash is a common ghetto business. The scam where the card holder buys bulk products they sell for cash is more of a white thing for some reason. Blacks will just sell the cards to the local gang bangers for cash. My hunch is the former requires more work, but less interaction with the government. The latter requires the banger to use the card now and the seller has to go to the state and get a replacement.

        The world need not be such a horrific place.But it’s going to take more than pontificating on the internet to stop these things.Ain’t everbody going to go silently into the heavily surveilled night.After all, if the surveillance state were as all powerful as you seem to think, England and the rest of Europe would not be having near the problem with EM’s that they are right now.The inherent incompetence and hubris of the state, leveraged by people with the will to fight, will be what ultimately saves humanity from the busybodies.But won’t be nobody left to fight if you all just give up without even a whimper, like Z here.Remember that you were once men.  RESIST!

        It was London the first city that begin with the CCTVs in every street fashion, other cities in the World are imitating the English surveillance state.
Maybe is now surprise why two Englishman wrote about the surveillance state future 50 years ago, Huxley and  Orwell were seeing Englad future.

        maybe the cloud people will form their own little world and leave the rest of us alone.  they will live in a cocoon/cave and we will have the rest.  it’s not like they will need us or the land, once they are fully virtualized.

        Small business is notorious for running multiple sets of books.  Having worked for small business owners now and again over the years, I have seen many different versions of “hiding” the money.  I have come to believe that many small businesses were probably never viable without that bit of bookkeeping help. Tracking the currency will shut off the rest of that creative bookkeeping once and for all.  As if small business doesn’t have enough problems already.
