        The defying moment of the Republican Party in the latter half of 20th C was the launching of a CIA tool, William Buckley’s,  big government conservative movement, the idea that to combat the Soviet Union, ” Buckley wrote an article for Commonweal which insisted that Big Government and a large U.S. military might be a necessity for the duration of the Cold War.”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley%2C_Jr.
It’s been downhill from then on into today’s nightmarish National Security State.
We need to bring back the ideals of Robert Taft that have been crushed and discarded.

        Damned insightful, Z.  It appears to me that the Tea Party was never anything more tangible than the sick feeling in the pit of our stomachs that the “center cannot hold,” though that in itself is enough to be a factor in politics, present and future.  Seems to me that the current administration is not so much an agent for change, but an agent of preparation for the coming unbelievable (and foolish) assault on what remains of conservatism.  We live in lands where the left, not knowing where they are going, are making war on the right, who know not what they are defending.  This is the legacy of the Bush years.
