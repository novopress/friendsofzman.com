        The problem is that sometimes there ARE actual conspiracies, and that sometimes the most logical and parsimonious explanation for an event is that it was caused by a government conspiracy — like the Gretchen Whitmer kidnap hoax.Trump’s enemies in the political Establishment and the Deep State have told us for eight years that Trump is an “existential threat to democracy,” that he is “Hitler,” that he is a “fascist,” and that he “must be stopped.” As far back as 2016 they accused him of being an agent of Putin and said that Putin rigged the election to defeat Hillary.During his first WEEK in office they leaked his private calls to foreign heads of state to the media. (Who could have possibly done that? The NSA or the State Department?) They leaked his tax returns, which is illegal.They arrested General Flynn and threatened to arrest Flynn’s son. They impeached Trump twice on completely bogus grounds, the first time on the testimony of a Ukrainian Jew serving in the U.S. Army, the second time after he had already left office. They arrested Trump’s chief of staff and several of his political advisers, they arrested Trump’s lawyer and violated his attorney-client-privilege, they raided Trump’s home, and arrested him on over 90 felony charges in four separate jurisdictions. They found Trump liable for “rape” even though the statute of limitations expired and the “victim” couldn’t even remember the year it supposedly happened, and then they gave her $80 million for “defamation” because Trump denied it. They are trying to take a half-billion of his assets including Trump Tower.He was convicted on 34 completely bogus felony charges by a partisan judge who allowed a porn star to testify in open court about how small his penis is. He was supposed to be sentenced (and almost certainly incarcerated) July 11 but that was put on hold by the Supreme Court’s decision.And when he gets shot on July 13 we are supposed to just believe “Aw shucks, shit happens, ya know. Secret Service musta jus’ fucked up again.”OF COURSE these people want him dead, many of them have said as much.It is MORE plausible to assume that some FBI agent was radicalizing this kid on Discord and gave him inside information as to how and when he could get a shot off at Trump than it is to assume that the Secret Service just fell asleep on the job and some rando 20-year-old dweeb just so happened to find all the gaps in the security.Look, I’ve been within 100 yards of a president. I know what the security was like. You have a better chance of getting beamed up into the UFO at Area 51 then sneaking a rifle in and getting a shot off.

            “Look, I’ve been within 100 yards of a president. I know what the security was like.”Correct. In urban settings, line of site to adjacent buildings will be blocked off with rows of buses, etc. If you work on-site, you’ll be told not to enter offices that overlook where the president is speaking. Politically connected co-workers will offer you a ticket to the event if they consider you to be reliable (probably want to fill out the few seats). Uniformed Secret Service will check ticket-holders for weapons. That’ll get you to within a few feet of the great man. In the fairground-like setting in Pennsylvania where Trump was speaking, there were only a few large buildings some distance away to be kept clear of civilians. Instead, we find an adjacent building with no law enforcement and a ladder.

                I said this here yesterday but the ladder is the key to this whole caper. Finding out exactly how and when the ladder materialized and who put it there will reveal either massive incompetence or massive conspiracy. Either way, everyone involved needs to be arrested.

            Absolutely spot-on! For whatever reason, they absolutely hate Trump – even though, when in office, he pretty much caved and was no real threat to their agenda.

                It can only be that they think he knows all their secrets and they are scared he is really serious about ending the abuses they have all either participated in or profited greatly from. They thought he was in the club, but he wasn’t. Or maybe he was but he means to put an end to it now. He did always warn, since the 1980’s, that he might run for President. So, they were warned. Everyone laughed it off.

            When Obama was president I had a window office on the 22nd floor, with no view/angle on the street below. A presidential motorcade was belatedly diverted to drive by. Shades-and-earpiece men took great pleasure in kicking me out of there—and touching all the sundress girls being herded out ahead of me. (A memorable image.) The city’s whole downtown was post-apocalyptically emptied for an armored car to pass through it at high speed.But Trump got shot from “outside the perimeter.” Sure.They did screw up. I’ve been saying for what feels like years now, the plan they very clearly telegraphed was for a cop to kill Trump at his New York sentencing. That court date was canceled. Their plans are crappy. Letting thisRegistered Repulican™soyjack take Trump out was crappy plan B.Or plan M? This was thefifthpublicly known assassination attempt since his election. There were more before that—remember the British actor?—also featuring a weirdly accommodating Secret Service.Here’s my theory: In 2016, thegovernance of the Westwas transformed into a conspiracy against Trump.

                Here is an example of the precautions they took to keep their mulatto boy safe. Four inch thick bulletproof glass:
Obama’s own Berlin Wall! US President issues warning to austerity Europe from behind bulletproof glass | Daily Mail Online
At a military academy graduation, I was told that the Secret Service considered depriving the cadets of their (unsharpened) ceremonial sabers, which were part of the dress uniform, in Obama’s presence. They relented and did allow the cadets to graduate with the sabers, but such security paranoia seems to be curiously absent for Trump.

                Yep. Don’t forget the reaction to the Brexit referendum. That didn’t just catch the British elite off guard; it signaled to all the EU elites that they faced a growing populist problem. Solution? Mass immigration plus crackdown on new right leaning parties. Especially and egregiously in Germany.2016 is our fake and gay version of 1848 on both sides of the Atlantic. In both instances, the elites have learned for themselves that they have lost legitimacy derived from tradition; in the case of the monarchs of 1848, any claim to legitimacy through family blood or even divine right. In the case of 2016, that the patina of popular election and democratic support has worn off. In both cases, the rulers only possessed one option: repression. It took another two generations for that method to be exposed as a failure after 1848. Us? We’ll just have to wait and see.

                Last president I saw live was Nixon, believe it or not.  Some ceremony or other on the White house grounds.  I was a kid and don’t remember being aware of security features at all.  Then Bush the senior toured my workspace when he was VP.  I was out of the office that day (cannot recall why) and everyone told me about the Secret Service, bomb-sniffing dogs, etc.
When I was a teen/college age I at times took the subway that Congress uses – don’t recall any security then either.  The past is a different country.

                    Hah.  When small, late 50’s, parents went to Washington DC.  Took a tour of the White House.  Procedure—assemble early morning on one of the driveways, stand in line, get admitted as smallish group with tour guide.  Don’t remember any great security (although I was a kid), certainly no scanning, physical searches, and no special passes from your Congresscritter required. Not much different from the entertainment parks of the day, except we were not queuing for a “ride”.

            And the SS are human, not the point that they are fallible but they have human passions and want to be seen as high status. They are not working for the SS because they just happened to be there, they see it as a high status job. Do you think their friends don’t roll their eyes when they tell them about their job protecting orange hitler?over time they grow to resent trump, and say double meaning things to each other in lunch about “oops, forgot to check that door”then, a higher up comes in and tells them we are leaving this spot near this roof for the local police , the ss just go along.i don’t see how hard it would be to set this up after whitmer and Jan 6.very few people in permanent Washington don’t hate trump.

        In the last few years I’ve witnessed several “stars aligning” moments of absolute worst case scenario chain reaction clusterfucks unfold all due to a series of incompetent decisions from a succession of idiotic people.I call it the before covid / after covid, in our AC era I just expect everything to wrong in the most spectacular fashion, I’ve been conditioned to expect that.My neighbor got upgraded fibre internet, the mexicans who did it cut my line, AT&amp;T swore up &amp; down they’d fix it within a week. A month goes by, nobody came, so I canceled my internet &amp; signed up again &amp; of course they sent someone out (new customer!). They sent a guy I’ve nicknamed black joe davola, if you’ve seen the Seinfeld episode you know what I’m talking about except he’s ghetto with gold teeth. Anyway he can’t fix my line but he can rig it temporarily, so he does, he mentioned that since I was the first to get fibre on my street I’m the main node everyone else will connect to. Well funny that because he inadvertently cut the entire street’s fiber except mine so everyone else that had fibre internet was suddenly cut off except me. Took a month and a half for them to show up in my yard to tear it all up again to get to the connection.This is just one of dozens of examples I’ve witnessed, even the most mundane things have these chain reactions of fuck ups. These examples are private companies, admittedly mostly corporate so totally in line with DIE policies but still nowhere as incompetent as the government where nobody ever faces consequences for failure no matter how much damage is done as a result.To me it’s far more plausible that the assassination attempt was sheer incompetence &amp; even the conspiracy aspect, the shooter who I expect to be announced as on the fed’s radar approximately two weeks from now, is also included in that. I fully expect to hear they had glowies egging this mongo along but again but they clearly didn’t pick a good candidate to let loose nor did they bother to equip him with gear that would offset his inherent leftist ineptitude.I remember under Trump the CIA sent a couple of dingy boats with private operatives to Venezuela to apparently go overthrow the leadership, that was four years ago. Even the private companies the CIA contracts to do black ops are hapless idiots now.The irony is Trump’s assassination attempt was mostly made possible by incompetence and so too was the fact he survived what should’ve been an easy kill shot. At this point I wouldn’t trust the feds to make a cup of coffee without royally botching it in some unpredictably &amp; comically retarded fashion.The conspiracies we’re seeing now is primarily a product of the fourth law of human stupidity: non-stupid people always underestimate the destructive power of stupid individuals. The people running things are so dumb it’s difficult to grasp, the chaos they create is beyond logical comprehension so an overarching conspiracy seems more plausible on the face of it. It’s also more comforting to think the havoc we’re witnessing is being secretly orchestrated rather than being a product of low IQ people unwittingly unleashing pandemonium everywhere they go.

            Very well said.  These days I am more inclined to attribute things to malice, but you make excellent points about how we tend to underestimate the amount of damage plain old stupidity can do.  And since I’ve had minimal patience with stupid people since childhood, and since people have been getting more stupid with each passing decade, my daily “tolerance for stupidity” margin has been shrinking.

                3G…I sense a smaller and smaller circle of human beings with whom you will be willing to interact in your future – and a larger and larger circle of human beings with whom you will be unwilling to interact (yet may be forced, or find it necessary to).  At least that’s my experience.

                “my daily “tolerance for stupidity” margin has been shrinking”I’m cursed with having a hyper sensitivity to expose to stupid people, specifically people who are both stupid &amp; smug / arrogant which is seemingly the default combination. After discovering the Dunning-Kruger study about stupid people it suddenly made sense why it’s so common.At this point I’m confident that if I opened the puzzle box from the movie hellraiser pinhead would show up &amp; decide to leave me right where I am. He’d be like “well this is awkward, usually this is where I’d summon hook chains to drag you to hell but it seems you’re currently at peak psychic pain as a result of living in clownworld, carry on as you were.”(For anyone hasn’t seen that movie people solve a puzzle box that summons a bdsm demon to take them to their personalized hell to be horrifically tortured for eternity.)

                    Thanks for the explanation at the end.  I have watched minimal TV or movies for literally decades, so most pop culture references are totally alien to me.  And even the older ones with which I’m familiar I find totally overused (I absolutely detest the pretentious use of the faux word ‘grok’).

                        I guess I should count myself lucky I haven’t ever encountered that word, first I’ve ever heard of it ironically enough. But yeah no problem, it’s funny I actually described it because I was worried it was too old of a movie to be referencing nowadays since it came out in 87. Admittedly there was other movies, they weren’t great &amp; there was also a remake with a tranny that came out a few years back, because of course there was.My closest friends, a married couple, somehow keep watching new movies &amp; shows together, I cannot comprehend how, I really can’t. They gave up on trying to get me into what they’re watching about a decade ago, I can’t help but impulsively commentate to point out the propaganda tactics as I watch. They can sort of turn off their brains so to speak but I can’t, I’m permanently plugged in &amp; unlike most people my subconscious is basically spot welded to my regular waking conscious so I’m constantly noticing subtleties that most people miss.Anyway I thought I was quite militant with not watching newer media, compared to you I’m practically a cosmopolitan bugman lol.

                            I grew up watching the usual ’60s and ’70s schlock, with some exceptions.  Once I hit college I stopped watching TV (too busy and too many other interesting things to do). Then I spent years overseas.  Once back in the US the only thing I ‘watched’ was kids’ shows to carefully police (or so I thought at the time) what went into my kids’ brains.  And we were too broke to go to many movies.  So anything past mid’70s and I have no clue, unless one of my sons got me to watch it (such as Firefly).

                                That’s too bad the cutoff was the 70s, the 80s is the best decade for movies in my opinion. Everything that came after that was a downward slide especially when it comes to depictions of men, now people like to shit on 80s movies for toxic masculinity which speaks for itself really.Where I live our seasons go from mosquito bite to frost bite so during the worst months of the year when it’s miserable outside my routine when I’m home with nothing going on is reading books &amp; watching movies/shows. Naturally I have a lot of exposure due to that &amp; speaking of I’m basically the official media watchdog for my friend’s kids. Never thought that would ever serve any real world purpose but that’s just one of many things I never thought would happen, strange times we live in.

                The aspect of “stupidity” as seen in the USA has been explained in the most part through diminished IQ due to human mutational load in the absence of strict Darwinian selection for the last 200 years or so—but not completely!Confounding/contributing to this theory are any number of factors.  Major ones to note being importing of different (inferior) races, school standards lowered in response to this influx, reduction of meritocratic selection due to DIE considerations, which are in the end themselves due to the democratic process (even the stupid and unproductive must have a vote).Our saving Grace was in the past the “Smart Fraction” which were those people not affected by the above holding certain critical positions of support in the nation’s infrastructure.  But they seem to have been swamped/undermined through the ascendency of DIE and the resulting elimination of meritocracy in the workforce.RVIDXR’s problem of a severed fiber optic cable is now Boeing’s problem of doors blowing off their 747’s.  As we get the details of Trump’s assassination attempt, we are seeing the results of DIE writ large—and interestingly, a perfect example of what was pointed out yesterday in commentary—a complete lack of acceptance of responsibility (by the SS Director) that (used to) comes with authority.  This time in a branch of law enforcement.No one is unaffected it seems.  And so it goes…..

                    Just as Woke is the new term for Politically Correct, so too DIE is the new acronym for Affirmative Action. A lump of feces by any other name stinks just as badly.

                        I actually think there’s a difference. AA was always understood to be about blacks. Once you had 10% Gangstalicious on your team you were done and everybody else just had to work 11.1% harder (do the math and you’ll see). DIE is more about lovingly curating a vast rainbow of freaks, perverts, cross-dressers, felons, recent immigrants who don’t speak any English, and that one guy with the grey skin and huge almond eyes whose car is saucer shaped.It’s much worse in its effects. For one thing, the rainbow of weirdos is much more than 10% of the population. In some places, such as San Francisco, it’s like 75%. The minority of normies who just thought they were there to do a job and get a decent paycheck have a huge workload that now includes fixing the constant screw-ups done by the rainbow people.Meanwhile, poor Gangstalicious barely gets any attention. This may even be part of the black support for Trump. Blacks seem downright normal compared to the clown rainbow and are feeling the resentment we all do for them.

                            No disagreement as to current observations, but I am old enough to have been in on the beginning of AA, as in “before and after”.  It wasn’t such in the beginning.Seen any number of early AA efforts that were intended to provide “equal and positive” inputs into the environment of those folks deemed “deprived” in order to bring them “up to snuff”.  Head Start was one such program for example. It failed, as all such programs eventually do, because it was based on the false premise of “equality” between races.As soon as these program failures began to stack up and become obvious to all, the name of the game switched to “equity” and as such, meritocracy was eliminated in favor of racial quotas (spoils), and we (Whites) have been bled dry ever since.

            Semi-related. Not the conspiracy theory part, simply the crisis of competency. Your example of a bunch of DEI hires basically cutting, reactivating, and cutting various people’s internet connections show what we all know is coming.The cascade of failure will continue to grow as our average IQ continues to plummet due to the brown mud genetics that are becoming our national population. Goblinas and Pajeets cannot maintain 1st world infrastructure. This will range from small annoyances like your internet being disrupted up to catastrophic failures like doors falling off airplanes in mid-flight.This one is the latter sort. Call 911, sorry, not available. These creatures cannot maintain the system and to admit that they are too dumb to do so is rayciss so the system will simply limp along until it cannot anymore. This is how much of the world works currently because the world is largely brown and dysfunctional, contrary to what the lefty lunatics like you to believe.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/16/911-emergency-system-brink-of-crisis/74411456007/

                I can’t even call my local police station to report ordinances anymore, they fired the woman who lived &amp; worked here &amp; replaced her with an out of state call center staffed by shaniquas.This guy was running heavy machinery at 11pm &amp; I called &amp; shaniqua explained she was our new non emergency dispatch &amp; informed me that the sound ordnance for machinery is ackshully 24/7 &amp; that my city’s website stating 8am to 8pm is wrong. She knows better you see, she has it right there on the computer.So now I have drive to my police station anytime I have a non emergency need for police.As for 911, that went down in multiple cities during, wait for it, covid lockdowns. I remember tucker carlson had a segment talking about LA, I think, having a pre-recorded message basically telling callers you’re on your own.I encourage everyone to get into prepping, not for doomsday purposes but for when things inevitably stop working and/or become too dangerous to use like water being poisoned. We’re importing people who can’t maintain clean nor running water or electricity for that matter so best be prepared for that.I also encourage people to train with firearms &amp; at the bare minimum keep pepper spray on them at ALL times. I learned that myself recently when a feral pit bull showed up on my street &amp; attacked a neighbors dog. Turns out it’s owned by a bantu who just moved in courtesy of blackrock renting him the house they just bought down the street. So glad they sold the house for above mark value &amp; put a gorilla in an otherwise nice White neighborhood.That’s incredibly common now, that kid that was stabbed? Biden admin converted eight(!) apartment complexes right around that giant eagle to section 8 &amp; almost overnight that area has turned into the congo. Between section 8 conversions &amp; blackrock there’s no escape unless you go really rural and/or a place that doesn’t have a public bus route &amp; no existing apartment complexes to black the city.I pay out the nose in taxes &amp; HOA fees specifically to avoid diversity but there’s no stopping blackrock &amp; I have no control over the feds firing my local city workers or post office employees &amp; replacing them with gorillas. I lose mail constantly now, I never wanted to do online banking but I have no choice now because mail just doesn’t come or go to it’s destination anymore.This just the early stages of it too, it’s gonna get way way worse in the days ahead.

                    Brain drain is definitely happening, there was a study that came out years ago talking about how Nigeria is being hurt by out migration of its most intelligent people. I don’t see any reason to assume they’re an exception &amp; not just for intelligence but crime as well. I would love to see the crime statistics of muslim countries who have out migration to the West, I’d bet my life on it the crime rate has taken a nosedive.In particular the more shithole the country is the more they benefit from migrants leaving. Think about how we’re clinging to hope that our country can be turned around as it’s being rapidly destroyed &amp; now think about the type of pond scum that would abandon their country without a second thought so they can go live like parasitic savages in another foreign country.Ironically that’s my white pill, even if America is lost there’s going to be several South American countries to colonize that will be far better off than the dumping ground we currently reside in. We conquered the continent before &amp; it can be done again, the land isn’t going anywhere. I think that’s what’s going to happen, save for a deus ex machina situation, the signs are already there that we’re going to mimic what happened to cuba. That’s why I don’t fault any sane Whites for leaving the country, they can always come back if by some miracle there’s a radical change in trajectory.I’d even go so far as to say I hope that’s what happens quite frankly, there’s an absurd amount of Whites who are irredeemable &amp; I don’t see the whole “one race, White race” myth going away, that universalism seems to be hardwired into Western Euros in particular. Best outcome would be all the sane Whites leave, build up their population elsewhere while the shitlibs get eaten alive &amp; then come back &amp; re-conquer what is rightfully ours.If we’re going to exist in a third world shithole no matter what then why the hell should we stay in the most aggressively dysgenic, degenerate, anti natal, anti White shithole when there’s countless other places that, while primitive, don’t have that agenda? That’s my thinking anyway. As an example I doubt the government of El Salvador would suddenly decide to shove negro worship &amp; trannies down our throats if we moved there. I also doubt the president would do a heel turn &amp; decide to legalize brown crime. People love to act like it’s just over if the West dies when it’s really not, we have plenty of options that are way better than sticking around here if it comes to that.

                            I know it’s inevitable we’ll have nasty people among us &amp; perhaps those otherwise sane Whites who run apologetics for leftists is too, it just seems like we’re an extreme minority.As for the fracturing that definitely is happening at least politically but at the same time it’s getting blacked across the board via HUD housing, section 8 vouchers / apartment complex conversions &amp; blackrock offering ridiculous amounts of money to people selling their homes then blacking the house. Meanwhile Whites are aging out &amp; barely having kids as the hordes flow into country.I’m currently watching the convergence of at least a dozen formerly pure White cities in my region. The trend of brown demographics &amp; decay has been steadily marching in for the last decade but its sped up considerably since biden took power. The only thing that’s keeping those cities from falling into another ghetto shithole is the old folks who can’t afford to move. Once they go blackrock will buy up everything &amp; section 8 it &amp; the transformation will be complete. I hope I’m wrong about my perception of things but that seems like a micro version of what’s happening to the entire country itself. If that’s what’s actually happening then there won’t be anything to fraction off from besides the country itself.

                                No doubt that is the plan. Additionally, alien fortresses like Colony Ridge keep popping up. The problem is the savages eventually gravitate towards the gibs, and those are most generous in densely populated urban centers. The most friction will be intrastate as a direct result, along with the feds leaning on governors and legislatures to expand Medicaid and so forth. I do agree it will become increasingly difficult to separate at some point in no small part due to the costs. As someone wrote here, I think, in a multiculti hellhole luxury is the ability to live far from diversity.

                                    Thing about the gravitating towards gibs is true but the blacks are just like us in that they don’t want to live around other races especially south Americans who don’t speak English. That’s a big driving force of why those cities I mentioned are getting blacked, the cities get flooded with the migrants &amp; the blacks start fanning out &amp; of course we have HUD jews sitting around looking up zip codes deliberately blacking White areas. There was an article from some jewish woman bragging about that years ago, framed in muh diversity terms of course but you could tell she relished what she was doing.Honestly at this point I’m convinced the only way anything will change is if the diversity itself turns on the government &amp; I’m not talking protests or looting shoes. It doesn’t take much to placate them though, feed them, let them fuck &amp; commit crimes &amp; they’re content which is exactly what they’re doing.Again hopefully I’m wrong but even if I’m not, I’m not worried about it, there’s other places to live &amp; those places are a lot less hostile than here so I expect birthrates of those who leave to rise as a result.

                            This actually makes sense in the largest picture, that whites are the fair flowers meant to be spread. Our castoffs are their upgrade.
It’s not fair, it’s not nice, but Nature is beyond morality.There is still yet a direction to Creation, and we are its keel.
The Seeding layer must be populated.  For that to happen, you must have whites in this world to provide the pass, else the entire flowering plant dies before budding.

                Spot on. Which is why I advocate a combination of self-sufficiency and as much social isolation from the larger toxic culture of Klownword as possible.  I live 3 miles off the pavedroad and we have fiber optic internet.  And when we had a few issues when we first moved in, the provider came all the way out to our place – free of charge – and found/fixed the issue.  That is why we’ve ‘retreated’ to heritage America.

            I’m not negating your point but I can recall having problems with exactly this particular things way back around 2002. At my house in FL we had cable internet when it was still fairly new there. I recall the cable company, whose name might begin with a C and end with a T, sending an absolute parade of potheads and dumbasses to my place to “fix” problems. Only about 30% of them were brown. They really seemed to have some mysterious knack for finding the absolute dumbest fuckups in the White population.I did learn from this that, once something is actually sort-of working, it’s an even bet that calling the service provider will actually result in them taking the service down entirely. Once Stoner McWirecutter gets out of his work truck there’s no telling what he’ll do.

                Oh that’s definitely par for the course to be sure but I never had to wait a month &amp; a half to get my service fixed especially if they themselves broke it. Twenty years ago they would’ve sent out an emergency team to fix just my service let alone the entire block having their internet cut off. It’s the degree of the incompetence that’s changed, back then they would’ve gave me a discount for the trouble but this time around I had to fight to get my bill nullified for the month they weren’t providing me internet. Things weren’t hunky dory before but now we may as well be an african country with how consistently terrible everything is running.

        Still prefer to go for “institutional idiocy” as the first explanation. Overall IQ has been leveling down.  In the DC aristocracy, we’ve moved to the second and third generation offspring of intermarried bureaucrats…essentially “post turtles” in the positions they occupy.  Add in new DIE entrants and you dumb things down even further. Zero accountability w/consequences adds to that.  “I’m the first female lesbian to head the SS, I can’t be fired or held accountable”.  Multiple failure points stack up and you get what you saw on Saturday.

            DEI is sand in the gears for the whole system and it is impossible to wall off any section from the competency crisis it brings about.
I always note that this SS rework was spearheaded by Obama, which, credit to him as DEI was more important to him than his own personal safety.

            Education used to mean something. Now it is a participation ribbon.Lack of critical thinking, failure to learn from the past, ignorance of different cultures and themes across history.Americans are in for a bumpy ride as they learn more about those Newcomers, and about the countries and cultures they left behind. Some will resist, others will push to turn up the temperature on the Melting Pot, and still more will check out of conventional society to the exurbs further from harm’s way. Many will have no choice but to ride it out.

                Most of the GenXer NormieCons and Boomercons I know believe that everyone on earth wants to be an American, watch football, grill and chill, and watch the stock market. Trying to reason with most whites is useless; conservatives love to drop the word “racist” as much as liberals. Any of us trying to point out natural differences is still going to encounter Lady Liberty Emma Lazarus, only wearing a red MAGA hat:“Whuddya’ mean, they won’t assimilate? I grew up next door to an Indian family in the 1980s! Neurosurgeons and nuclear physicists! They’re more American than you are! The guy in the taco truck has a Trump shirt!

                        My take is somewhat different. I think it’s about the number of people more than it is about the diversity. If we had kept diversity to lower numbers, there wouldn’t be as many of us infuriated by the whole thing. It’s white replacement completely sanctioned by the people who supposedly represent us (JD Vance, Mitch McConnell, Trump) and it’s p*ssing a lot of us off.

            As someone who lives in the DC area, I can tell you that the managerial class has increasingly become a family affair. It’s natural. The father/mother move to DC to work for Congress, one of the committees, lobby firms, consulting firms, military, military contractors, tech firms related to the military, etc.Back in the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s, they came in droves from various parts of the US. They get married and raise a family in the DC suburbs. Their kids enjoy a nice live in a nice area. They go to a good college somewhere and when they graduate, mom and dad have connections to help them into the beast.Dad has security clearance so knows how to work that system. Next thing you know the son or daughter has security clearance. No need to worry about foreigners taking that job. I can’t tell you how many kids of the DC managerial class end up working for Congress, some NGO, State Dept, military tech firms, etc. Why wouldn’t they?But here’s the thing. These kids – even the bright ones – are incredibly insulated. They can’t conceive of thinking differently from the hive, nor do they have any great desire to do so. Fish don’t think about the water. It’s just there.The second – and now third – generation filling the managerial class is often less intelligent (though not always) as their parents or grandparents, but just as important, far less capable of critical thought.

                    The thing is that a lot of these people – despite what Z says – are actually pretty book smart. They can do well in class. Some even hike and camp and do real people stuff.
But they never really mentally leave their bubble. They get good grades, go to good colleges. Even if they leave the DC area, it’s to NYC or Silicon Valley. They just go from one bubble to another. Everyone they know if is in the bubble. To them, it’s not a bubble world. It’s the real world. And they like it.

                        I grew up in that world and fully concur with all you’ve said.  Even many years after my husband and I left DC and the fedgov, my parents could not comprehend why we (with our education and credentials and supposed smarts) would prefer the private sector.  And this was when we merely left the east coast for a large DFW suburb.  If she had any idea where we’ve chosen to live now (I don’t think she’s compos mentis any longer) she’d be totally astonished.

                100% accurate and the reason I had to escape DC in a radical way.They love smelling their own farts basically. Very arrogant, book smart in some cases, yes, but profoundly ignorant in all other ways. This is what makes them so hard to tolerate. Pontificating about nearly everything from a place of faux knowledge while actually knowing very little. They are legion.Also, not just the family affair, but the social circle. I have friends here obviously that would be horrified if I ever revealed my true power level to them. They all work for NGOs and LOVE what they do. I mean, how couldn’t you love it? The Atlantic just featured them in an article! And I hear that Vanity Fair is going to do one next quarter about the other NGO that Cat Lady #3 I know that lives in that new high rise in Arlington works for.Those are the actual conversations I have overheard at their little circle jerk parties. They are intolerable to so many but truly believe everyone thinks like them. It is a steel belted reality bubble they live in. Openly mocking of Trump and his redneck supporters, because obviously everyone at THIS party is on the same page, am I right?! This type of arrogance is manifest all through DC.It is why though it would obviously affect me personally, I’m willing to “take one for the team” if our friend Vlad decided to just glass the Tidal Basin. It would be a net positive for the world at large.

                    You’re spot on about their arrogance. The fact that they don’t think twice about absolutely trashing on flyover people in gatherings shows that they have zero fear that these people can do anything to them – personally or professionally – and that no one in their circles will disagree.I think that I’m one of the few people who wasn’t too shocked by Trump Derangement Syndrome because it reminded me of how DC people have been talking about Southern “rednecks” forever. Pure hatred and believing  truly insane things about them and how they think. Of course, under all of that hate is fear. It’s why J6 shock them so badly.

                    AP, Citizen:Very accurate. I was caught abroad in my youth among colonies of this stripe–East Coast fedgov types, cloistered in their little groups, dismissive of white Americans generally, Southerners in particular. I’m a Southerner and proud of it, and was treated as an exotic outlier. It would be hilarious when they finally realized the “Ugly American” stereotype of locals applied largely to them because (a) they were in the midst and (b) generally repellent. The fedgov abroaders often would have been going native (in their minds) up until that very realization, and then wheel around on the natives and become dismissive of them. They were oblivious to how ludicrous and hypocritical they were and it was quite amusing. Most were educated midwits, reasonably intelligent, and totally unimpressive. I could not fathom voluntarily living among them anywhere.

                        Educated midwits is the right description. These people aren’t stupid, but they’re not geniuses either. (I know. I’m a midwit.) Heck, in fact, some are quite intelligent.
But I noticed right away that they lack a willingness to question things, to ask why. Even the bright ones had intellectual blinders on. You see it all the time with think tank people and “experts.” They were good in a classroom but were worthless in making decisions or trying to really figure out what was going on. It just never crosses their minds.

                            Independent thought isn’t their forte, for certain. Setting aside the Hive Mind business, many seem literally afraid even to entertain new theories and conclusions and venture outside their safe thought zones. This is true of most groups, of course, but especially pronounced with them. The handful I knew who did think independently were indeed quite intelligent, and while an assumption on my part since contact was severed, probably lived very sad lives if they remained cloistered in that environment. That last may be projection on my part because it would have applied to me possibly because I’m not tough enough.

Actually, it’s less like being a spy and more like I’m one of the last humans walking around at the end of the movie the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

            “I’m the first female lesbian to head the SS, I can’t be fired or held accountable”.  But she  accepted full responsibility, didn’t you hear?  Accepting responsibility used to mean resigning and humbly staying quiet.  Now it’s an opportunity to do the opposite of actually taking responsibility, as you puff your little chest out even further.

Exactly, America is systemically broken at all levels; institutions, systems, structures and procedures.  America no longer works.  Trump assassination attempt epitomizes the brokenness of the country.

                    TempoNick:  They’re all busy reliving the moment Trump fist pumped and said “Fight!”  I’ve already said kudos to the man for his manly-reaction and calm demeanor.  But as Wild Geese said, no one ever bothers to think of long-term consequences.  The consequences of introducing a subcon – a ‘devout’ and practicing Hindu no less – into the presidential family line of succession are predictable and awful for White people.  But all the assassination attempt did was get people – even here – all fired up to vote harder.

                        That’s my big mantra. It’s not just about religion or race, it’s about the entire social fabric of this country. It’s about who your kids are going to marry and what faith your grandkids are going to be raised in (probably none). It’s about the stability of their own families (interfaith marriages have a high rate of divorce). It’s about celebrating Christmas and Easter together as a nation. It’s about messing with the fabric that holds society together. It’s like the old saying about everybody else only playing checkers. Can’t anybody think even one or two steps ahead?

I’m not even blaming white women.  They’ve been brainwashed to hate men, to be man, hate whiteness, etc.  And they are still the most desired female and getting more desired because they are rarer than ever.  So I can see them becoming defensive from all the male gazes they get.

                                    I’m currently in Taiwan and it’s breathtaking how much more feminine the typical female presents herself when compared to her American counterparts.  I’ve spent chunks of time in the Far East going back almost 30 years and the gulf widens all the time.  I see a few more tattoos but they’re still rare and never garish like a sleeve or full back.  Dresses and skirts are still very common, and even more casual outfits are commonly given a feminine touch.  In the past week, I haven’t seen a single pair of leggings/yoga pants.  And yes, there are behavioral cues that make clear these aren’t generally women infected with 4th wave feminist thought cancers.All things being equal, I believe white men should continue their bloodlines.  But you can’t argue with male biological impulses – they’re going to choose a mate that they believe will afford them the best chance of domestic felicity.

I was at work when he, reading from his phone, told me that Trump had chosen J D Vance. I said,” I can’t stand that guy.”“Why not?”” I read his book and the guy comes across as an elitist, backstabbing snob who dumps all over the poor Whites he grew up among. Plus he’s married to an Indian.”Without pausing for a single moment the guy responded with, “I wish he would have picked Vivek Ramaswamy. I liked what that guy had to say.”Am I even living in the real world?

Then you chimed in. Are you being ironic, maybe?
Based Bigots, is it? You are a fool.

Ironic? I suppose it was. I didn’t mean Based Bigots in a pejorative way.
I’ve seen Fuentes and Anglin, amongst others, make some big deal out of the JD Vance pick but I don’t understand why this is worse than the alternatives.
Or if you’re in the camp that thinks voting is pointless or trump sucks and is a shabos or whatever, why get hung up on the Vance detail?

                            Oh Lord, I empathize.  It’s yet another symptom of “We’re all the same, the human race,” or the Bushite proclamation that “Family values don’t stop at theRio Grande.”  Obviously being human includes some fundamental similarities, but these sorts of platitudes are merely more emotional versions of seeing people as fungible economic units.
People are DIFFERENT.Races,religions, cultures, classes.  Those differences matter more than any principles they supposedly espouse.  Watch how they live, not what they say.  And when crunch time comes, they alwaysreturn to their people and roots.  Always.

        We have to learn to live with the fact that there’s a lot of stuff we just don’t know. We’re told explosives were found in the assassin’scar. We’re told he got up on the roof via a tall ladder which probably wouldn’t have fit in said car. Was it like those pallets of bricks strategically delivered to BLM riot locations? (Apparently no one in government has bothered to track down the renters of the U-Haul trucks—snaps of which were helpfully uploaded to social media—possibly used in their logistics.) Then this former BlackRock advertising extra was up on a nearby roof with an assault rifle for minutes while people in the crowd who saw him shouted the threat to law enforcement. He gets off several shots and is immediately Jack Ruby-ed, almost as if a counter-sniper had him zeroed in. The regime media was lying even as we watched a live feed of the event.They would have quickly settled on a very different narrative had the attempt succeeded. But it didn’t, so they’ll simply move on, and we’ll likely never get the real truth of what happened. Can we expect more positive media coverage of the Orange Man as the blob tries to absorb him?

            That Indians were able to invade and become the new Jews more or less with nothing but having learned a bit of English from the Brits shows that resisting aggressive ethnocentric groups is an intrinsic weakness of our society.

                No, I don’t buy this. Movies, television, newspapers, plays, etc. Have been laying the mental groundwork for this type of suicidal naive sympathy in the collective white consciousness for a century now. Longer even, if you take a critical eye to some of the underlying messages within even certain 19th century theatrical productions.Even as recently as WW2, US propaganda efforts had to appeal to a very blatant and visceral racial consciousness. Look at how the japs are depicted in the media of the time. Buck toothed, exaggerated eyes, and strong implications that they wanted to kill us and rape our women.It is only since the decades following the end of that war that the word “racist” was made into a thing. This was something that was done to us, slowly and subtly, and now.. not so subtly.i.e. accidentally make a “racist” joke on social media on the wrong day and get targeted for a witch hunt. Lose your job, be stalked by internet crazies and.. basically the system will do everything but straight up kill or jail you. (Actually if you live in England, they will arrest you)

                At the end of the evening, they closed with a Christian prayer, I’m assuming the priest was Catholic even though they called him “Pastor Remke.” Then Harmeet Dillon sang some weird Sikh prayer at the end. I turned the TV off.

        What in human affairs is not a conspiracy? The issue here is branding. That word has been successfully branded. Trademarked.I don’t need the world to make sense. If there was no God I could live with that. But I do notice when I’m being lied to, and sometimes, especially in public affairs nowadays, the lying is so obvious anyone can see it. Not to mention pervasive.If you don’t want me to “theorize” about “conspiracies,” then don’t lie to me. Don’t tell me I need to stay home because of the plague, but that it’s ok for people to get out and protest about the dead negro. Don’t make up stories about Russians and saturate the airwaves with them for years. Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.

However, a decision was made not to place any personnel on the roof.“That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there’s a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn’t want to put somebody up on a sloped roof.

Listen, you silly cow–if you’re in the SS it’s your job to put yourself in harm’s way to protect the potential target of violence. And if your pweshus wittle agents are too cowardly to perch on a sloped roof, then find a few who actually have a set of balls.
This isn’t merely stupidity and incompetence, it’s also cowardace.

I think you’re overlooking sheer laziness. Nobody is taught how to work anymore. I don’t dispute the stupidity and cowardice, but let’s not lose sight of the “Ain’t my job,” DMV Jogger mentality so many Whites have imbibed with their rap and their rat’s nest dreds.

                        I’m with Ostei on this. There’s got to be gear available to secure the agents on the roof. People secure themselves to the sides of fucking cliffs for God’s sake! The other SS guys on the other buildings seemed to have just set up at the peak of the roof where you can anchor yourself at the top of the ^ shape.And of course, like every other “lone wolf” perp in the world it seems, the Alphabet people knew about him before he “snapped”. The population of people known to the alphabet people do so much snapping that they’re practically a bowl of Rice Crispies. I’m actually starting to consider lining my boonie hat with a bit of tinfoil because of this. Are these agencies perhaps nudging these loons through “unofficial channels”? Maybe buying them guns and giving them hints about vulnerable locations? I’m actually starting to think this way.

                            It’s possible. That would mean Crooks was a de facto contract agent of an agency and that he’d been given an unofficial brief to take out Trump.

                        But for the fact that the “after” pictures of the dead assassin on the roof show it to be no more sloped (and looked less sloped) than the roof upon which they DID put agents.
I live in an area where the roofs are probably pitched 45 degrees or higher – the assassin roof couldn’t have been more that 20, which is nothing.  Heck, you don’t even need a sniper on there – just a few officers to make sure there isn’t anyone climbing up there.

Now the report comes out they watched and let the guy stay up there an half an hour before the shots were fired. (And he was headshotimmediately,as if a sniper had him in scope the whole time.)Another pointed out…is this guy Crooks or is this guy Yearwick?

        A little bit off topic, but I saw some footage of Trump at the convention this morning and I have never seen him so intensely humbled. I think he’s been gradually learning it these past few months, but I wonder if dodging that bullet has finally made him realize how much responsibility is resting on his shoulders.

                One of the first patterns I noticed when I started reading history as a young man was that ruling classesget destroyedwhen don’t have an ethnocentric working class having their back. Reliance upon mercenaries, especially foreign ones, is folly.If you are ruling class and value your family, then you better have a working class at your back which has conscious self-interest in your perpetuation, because it is in THEIR interest.I think one can model the power networks competing for rule over America as two Jewish factions (funded, led, organized by, but not exclusively composed of): the ‘genocide’ faction (Soros etc) who currently control the White House and the ’empire’ faction who Trump is trying to cut a deal with to preserve their wealth and power in exchange for acquiescence to mass deportations of illegal aliens. What the hell is in it for me and my family if Trump ‘succeeds’ in temporarily defeating the genocide faction and expelling hordes of useless unintegratables, if he joins with the empire faction in importing hordes of economically-not-useless integratable (but NOT assimilable-&gt;they are not us, will never be us, CANNOT be us) dothead Indians. Replaced by foreigners is replaced by foreigners.I’m still going to vote for him, but only because I have complete confidence the genocide faction is utterly incapable of taking ‘no’ for an answer. (Neither is the empire faction: they will not feel bound by an agreement with Trump or any other goy. This is merely a fleeting moment of mutual self-interest.) The long war will go on and Pres. Trump’s well-meaning civic nationalist counterattack will simply rile up the eternal enemy to step up their game. So be it. Collapse is the cure.

                    My answer is going to depend on whether he is Catholic or Muslim. I couldn’t find out the information after some quick googling. Yankees may disagree, but as a southern European, my definition of heritage America is basically Europe, the Roman Empire and its frontiers. Lebanon was part of the Roman Empire and nobody seemed to mind Danny Thomas and Jamie Farr too much. If he’s Lebanese Catholic, I’m kind of okay with that. Not ideal, but not completely off the mark.

                        I’m mixed on the issue.  Yes, the Lebanese populace is heavily mixed and includes people on all sides of the color, culture, and religious spectrum.  I have known Maronite Christians from Lebanon and Syria, and while they were definitely Christians and majority White, there were still notable cultural differences, some good and some bad.

                            Oh, I completely agree, but they still have the core basics that allow them to assimilate within American society over time. Growing up as an immigrant, especially within a strong family structure, it takes time to work through the ways of the place you came from, even as somebody born here. I think if you come from a culture that is traditionally Christian, you’ve got those basics.
That’s why I’m not horrified about Latin American immigration, like somebody people are on these kinds of boards, so long as they control the numbers. Asian immigration I’m not fond of.

                                Disagreere Latin American immigration.  Christianity is a vital component, but it is insufficient in and of itself (i.e. Nigerian and Korean “Christians” will never be Americans).Race is more important.  I suggest you look further into Latin American demographics – too many seem to believe the initial statistics offered online.  DaBears claimed Argentina was 90% White the other day – not at all so.  The following shows that even the Whitest % are about 76% White, and that’s a quite small portion of the overall population.The same study also found there were great differences in the ancestry amongst Argentines as one traveled across the country. For example, the population in the North West provinces of Argentina (including the province ofSalta) were on average of 66% indigenous, 33% European, and 1% of African ancestry.[32]The European immigration to this North West part of the country was limited and the original indigenous population largely thrived after their initial decline owing to the introduction of European diseases and colonization. Similarly, the study also showed that the population in the North Eastern provinces of Argentina (for example,Misiones,Chaco,Corrientes, andFormosa) were on average 43% of indigenous, 54% European, and 3% of African ancestry.[32]The population of the Southern provinces of Argentina, such asRío NegroandNeuquén, were on average 40% of indigenous, 54% European, and 6% of African ancestry.[32]Finally, only in areas of massive historical European immigration in Argentina, namely the Central provinces (Buenos Airesand the surrounding urban areas), Argentines were of overwhelmingly European ancestry, with the average person having 17% indigenous, 76% European, and 7% of African ancestry.[32]In another study, that was titled the Regional pattern of genetic admixture in South America, the researchers included results from the genetic study of several hundreds of Argentines from all across the country. The study indicated that Argentines were as a whole made up of 38% indogenous, 58.9% of European, and 3.1% of African ancestry. Again, there were huge difference in the genetic ancestry from across the various regions of the country.[33]For example, Argentines who hailed fromPatagoniawere 45% indigenous and 55% of European ancestry.[33]The population in theNorth Westpart of the country were made up of 69% of indigenous, 23% of European, and 8% of African ancestry.[33]The population in theGran Chacopart of the country were 38% of indigenous, 53% of European, and 9% of African ancestry.[33]The population in theMesopotamianpart of the country were 31% of indigenous, 63% of European, and 6.4% of African ancestry.[33]Finally, the population in thePampa regionof the country were 22% of indigenous, 68% of European, and 10% of African ancestry.[33]Finally, in another study published in 2005 involving the North Western provinces of the country, the genetic structure of 1293 individuals from Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Catamarca and La Rioja was analysed.[34]This study showed that the Spanish contribution (50%) predominated in Argentina’s North West, followed by the Amerindian (40%) and African (10%) contributions.[34]According to this study, Argentines fromJujuywere 53% indigenous, 47% European, and 0.1% African ancestry.[34]Argentines from Salta were 41% of indigenous, 56% of European, and 3.1% of African ancestry.[34]Those fromCatamarcawere 37% of indigenous, 53% of European, and 10% of African ancestry.[34]Those fromLa Riojawere on average 31% indigenous, 50% European, and 19% African ancestry.[34]The inhabitants ofSantiago del Esterowere on average 30% indigenous, 46% European, and 24% African ancestry.[34]The inhabitants ofTucumánwere on average 24% indigenous, 67% European, and 9% African ancestry.[34]

                                    Christianity is a vital component, but it is insufficient in and of itselfchristianity unifies the races in faith, but not in everyday interactions. It’s not even that race is more important, it’s that it’s not a society if it’s multicultural so Christianity has nowhere to go. Yes, this individual or that individual in a big pen of individuals like the us is, can become Christian and it’s necessary for each individual to make that assent of the mind, but since the collection of individuals CANT be a society because they don’t have the biological stuff to make one , the society won’t be christian. It would be better than not but it won’t be a society, it will still be a collection of individuals and that is never going to be peaceful.I heard Irish priests were sent to German parishes to break them up and demoralize them in the late 19th century. I heard Ukrainian married priests were sent into the Midwest to do the same thing and scandalize the Roman Catholics. Race is not just a nice thing, without a more or less racially homogeneous country, nothing can unify it.

        Given we’re four years on from the beginning of a ginned-up world-wide panic over a virus do you blame people for immediately suspecting a conspiracy regarding the attempted assassination of a Presidential Candidate?
The media exists, to a great degree, to fabricate narratives, even when the facts are clear.
People who don’t “Love Big Brother” suspect any utterance from official government or government adjacent body, like say the press. The press tells me “inflation has been tamed” yet who should I believe, the press or my eyes that see my credit card statement and thinning wallet? Expand that out.

            I was young, so I could simply have not been paying attention, but it seems to me since 9/11 it’s been the politics of the stampede. This coincides with the growth of the internet, which killed the politics of narrative. How to manage a stampede, rather than a rapt audience? I guess tptb have settled on trying to direct it, rather than controlling it.

                It was a case of never letting a crisis go to waste. The Power Structure didn’t plan the so-called “pandemic,” but once Covid popped up they sure hoisted in the possibilities and took full advantage of them.

                    Not to descend into a semantics argument, but “plan” is doing a lot of work there. Was it intentional? Dunno. I do know the virus was created with federal funding and that was hidden. The response was a wet dream for various interests who had devised ways to implement social engineering previously unthinkable.
They certainly plannedforit. I get you are implying as much, but due to the long-running programs developed to implement lockdowns and push the MRNA vaccine, we simply cannot discount intent although the evidence is not there yet.

        The decline will continue at a record pace as long as our society continues to wage war on reality.  In all of recorded history reality has never been defeated and it will not be any different this time.  The egalitarian paradise is not going to come no matter how many black and brown retards get put into positions they are grossly unqualified to carry out.  Things will break down even further.  Won’t be long before we see our first plane crash.  It’s already come dangerously close.

            How many women have beenraped and/or killed since they’ve all become convinced by the media that “women rule” and are more badass then men?  Plenty of people have already suffered the effects ofracial and sexualreality – and most of them still deny it.  One notable exception that I’m aware of is Lara Logan after her sexual mauling in Egypt.

        “In a process that began in the Renaissance, the conception of the person was progressively stripped of his essential features. Numerous truths were denied: first, man’s being ordered to God and his destiny of eternal Union with Him; then, the  immortality of the soul; then, the capacity for an authentic knowledge of reality; then the substantiality of the soul; then, free will, and so on. The process began with the ambition of making man into God and ended by making him a more highly developed animal or even a bundle of sensations. It is not surprising that in the course of the drift, man’s essential capacity to enter into deep communion with others and to build a community with them was forgotten.”Dietrich von HildebrandWe don’t need to reinvent the Christian God, we just need to return to Him

                Something I struggle with. I have a feeling monotheism is about developing a conscience, more or less, and one’s conscience becomes one’s god, or at least the interface with God. You have to listen to it, though. In Christian terms, Satan would be the one telling you you’re your own god, as he thought he could be.Protestantism obviously takes it the farthest, with its lesser emphasis on the communal aspects of Church and Tradition, in favor of Scripture, which is revealed— obviously much more individual. I can see where some would argue that’s satanic, yet the whole thing about monotheism. It’s the progress of humanity from beast ruled by the forces of nature called the gods to civilized, self-governing individual ruled by the kingdom of God within.It seems like this ancient project of civilization is leading us to hell. Troubling thoughts!

            “Numerous truths were denied: first,man’s being ordered to God…”“…democracy is it tells people that they are in charge, but that is impossible, and people sense it, so without a clear shot caller…”Our deepest instinct as social animals is to arrange ourselves; we primates do this around an alpha male flagpole.  Our complicated system of loyalties and signaling arises fractally as we arrange ourselves according to our distances near or far to that flagpole, a dance of six degrees of separation.  Being ‘connected’ is the whole of it; emotion, the language we used before speech itself, is the language of those connections.When people say ‘we lost God’, they are rightly saying we have lost our flagpole, the sense of it, the sense of having a clear north star.  A sense of who we are.

        People sense that things in their society have diverged from what they recall as happier times, and they are searching for the cause(s)…The actual cause is that societies, and especially empires, age into oligarchies which are run exclusively for the benefit of the rich and powerful, who have no allegiance to their countrymen…Therefore, they steal everything, fight wars that are really elite squabbles, and come to hate their own countrymen…Collapse follows, and a few centuries later, it starts over…

        The advent of AI will be the death of credibility. When every image, and every word can be computer generated we have no reason at all to believe that any of it is real. Indeed, it calls into question the very existence and nature of reality. Is it all fake? Who’s to tell?There are very good  reasons to mistrust any and everything that comes across electronic media. “The princess and the prince discuss what’s real, and what is not.”

                Most of my family from the previous generations comes from Southeastern Europe. I used to laugh at my uncle for saying sportsball games were rigged. We live in an honest, law abiding country. America wouldn’t do things like that. Here I am in late middle age now agreeing with him. He was right. Especially two Super Bowls ago, the first played by the Rams in their new stadium, reintroducing the team to a market that never really cared about pro football. Uh huh.

        Interesting post, Zman, especially the thoughts on the origin of the term “conspiracy.”In former times, the idea of “conspiracy” usually implied a large element of secrecy, to protect the conspirators before and (usually) after the fact. The “perfect” conspiracy would be totally unnoticed.But one trait of the present day variety, it seems to me, is that ”conspiracies” are meant to assert raw power: the ability of some elite party to act against the rules, get away with it, *and* force the rest of the society’s organs to go along with its narrative of the event, no matter how implausible the details.In a way, they are meant to be noticed as such. The death of Epstein in 2019 is the example that comes readily to mind. I wrote this in 2019, after Epstein’s “suicide”:“After the Epstein fiasco this weekend, every old conspiracy theory has a new lease on life. I feel that trust has evaporated in our country; it is now a*rational*alternative to entertain thoughts of conspiracy when presented with an event like Epstein’s death. Sadly, trust was the lynchpin of the American system, and once it’s gone, the entire system falls into question.”I can’t believe it’ll be 5 years since that episode—but what a 5 years! The logic has only solidified since then.

            “In a way, they are meant to be noticed as such.” They certainly are meant to be noticed, and used as a strawman to discredit our side and common sense.
What these deliberately ludicrous accusals remind me of is a dominance display by red squirrels; when one red squirrel wishes to win an argument, he sticks his erect d**k in the face of the other.  “So there!”

        Sean Davis and others (cites on Ace of Normies, if you want the originals), are arguing that Dr. Jill and others sought to kill Trump by Bureaucratic means.That they systematically drained his security team of resources, and scheduled at the last minute a Dr. Jill appearance that drained even more people from his team, and assigned only the most junior and inept people to protect Trump. That Jack Smith has big beefy professional dudes protecting him while Trump had … Melissa McCarthy.Furthermore, there were no snipers on the roof because “the roof was too steep” per the SS Director, a friend of Jill Biden’s appointed by Jill Biden, out of Pepsico. There were some local police on the second floor, who noted 26 minutes before the shooting that the dude was using a rangefinder and scoping out the building. He returned later with a backpack. Both were reported to SS via radio and nothing was done. Supposedly the counter-sniper team was reduced in half to send people to Dr. Jill’s event. And the counter-snipers were refused permission to shoot until they disobeyed orders and shot finally after Trump was hit and people were shot//killed.No one believes this was not planned from the start. So there is that.

        Over the years you have stated several times that we need a new “version” of Christianity. I think Christians need to focus on Christs entire ministry not just the Beatitudes.  The current interpretation (or version if you will) is due to the feminization of Christianity, which is THE problem today.  It has destroyed the Protestant church and is making headway with Catholicism.Christ never backed down once from his theological positions.  He argued with and insulted his adversaries a number of times in the Gospels.  Christians just need to go back to basics and get a spine.

        The online dialog about the Trump assassination fiasco is an attempt at crowdsourcing the analysis in the hope of producing a clearer understanding of what actually happened. And this is not wasted effort. The new internet age has amassed a huge reservoir of information and facial recognition may allow for distributed investigation of many of the people present that day. That is a window into these players, just as the Blackrock ad featuring the shooter is relevant. Sherlock Holmes was popular for good reason. Do not be dissuaded just because they mock you. Fuck the Stasi whores.

        I don’t buy this conciliatory crap coming from the media and the establishment. They all sound like they are apologizing to someone because Trump is not dead.
Also, I noticed all media sources say law enforcement is not commenting while they determine the shooter’s motive. By that, they mean law enforcement is working on framing a narrative about the shooting which can then be disseminated through all the usual channels. Anyone dissenting will be exiled.

        There is no common mental frame for society, ie “shared narrative”. This means society is coming apart. In such an environment one man’s explanation is another’s conspiracy theory.

        I tried to sort out what the most likely scenario was by mapping out all the possible ones and gauging their plausibility:1. Fake and Gay – Trump pops blood squib on ear while groomed kid shoots blanks and real sniper blows away a few audience members for good measure. The problem with this is that it just doesn’t feel like something Trump would do and he’d have to be involved in this. He’d have to go to the doctor and have his ear mutilated afterwards as well, and there are just so many people who would try and spill the beans on Trump if he was behind the conspiracy. Also he already probably thinks he’s winning after the debate so why do this nonsense, too risky.2. Kid is groomed and given blanks, real regime sniper was much further away and missed. Explains the miss from what was considered an easy shot, explains why the kid was allowed by the SS to get up there (cops wouldn’t have been in on it but they were evidently too disorganized to do anything). The police countersniper may have been waiting to shoot the kid once he started taking aim but shots came from the real sniper first?3. Kid is groomed and was the only shooter. Explains why he was allowed to get up there, but as previously it’s unlikely the police would have been involved just the SS so it is somewhat risky to rely on the police not stopping the kid unless the SS somehow made sure the cops were patrolling near that building. Thing is from like the Kennedys it doesn’t seem like the regime likes to rely on its patsies without a backup spook with better aim.4. Lone nut, intentionally incompetent SS. Trump was given an understaffed SS detail composed of folks hired by project vaginal bootstrap. Regime “conspiracy” consists of just producing the conditions where something is likely to happen by comparing Trump to Uncle Adolf and then giving him lousy security. The coincidence here is that this happened right when we assume the regime was freaking out over the debate and would have more incentive to actively do something violent, and this scenario is a more passive approach to trying to get Trump killed that they would have been doing for a long time.5. Lone nut, unintentionally incompetent SS. This is the no conspiracy scenario and is possible under the assumption that good times make for weak men and there have been very few assassination attempts in recent decades causing the SS to become complacent. Thing is given our general thesis is that the regime hates and sees the proles as enemies, it’s hard to accept that they would allow their security against the proles to lapse so badly.As far as what I’d bet on, 1 is definitely too complicated to work even though the probability of Trump randomly turning his head in just the right way to take the least possible amount of injury from a bullet and lock his election boggles the mind. (Maybe Eru intervened like when he made Gollum’s foot slip) I lean towards one of the kid being groomed scenarios mainly because 20 year old spergs who want to go a-killing don’t typically pick what was assumed to be the hardest possible target, they usually shoot up theaters and malls. Also the security agencies have a long history of grooming autists to do stuff like this.

            I’m starting to see it as of a piece with the Biden debate fiasco, suggesting that the debate nosedive wasn’t planned or intentional, it panicked the PTB into doing this, and the short time frame and lack of planning showed.
After Cheatle’s statement today, there is practically no doubt left in my mind that USSS was in on this somehow.

            3 and 4 seem most likely, with 5 a close second. A stand-down from the command/control SS officer on site would be enough to keep the locals from interfering.
Heard some speculation that they were not sure if assassin was “one of theirs” or local law enforcement taking a position, but I find that hard to believe. Hard, but not impossible I suppose. Also find it hard to believe there were no boots patrolling that roof which seemed to be the most logical place to make an assassination attempt.

            I vote fake and gay, no victims. That blood stained face of the kid on the roof looked like it was painted on. I agree Trump wouldn’t be involved in killing innocent people. The other “victims” probably reactivated military/intel, given a seat, top secret mission.
Like I said, I’m having trouble believing Ashley Babbitt was really shot. I just don’t believe the average office building cop is going to be so quick to start shooting at people. Could be, but given everything else that has gone on, I’m still sticking with my gut on this.

                Ashli Babbit’s killer wasn’t an average office building cop, he was a nut. There’s video of him running around inside the capital waving his gun in the air over his head like a wild man way before he shot Ashli.

            Good breakdown of possibilities, Ploppy.  I go somewhere between scenario 2 and 3.
The sadistic PTB and their media WANTED to show Trump’s cantaloupe blown out live on TV.  That would have been the kill shot for MAGA and Heritage America literally and spiritually.  Imagine the humiliation ritual of replaying his head splattering in slow-mo over and over.  It’s just dumb luck that BOM turned his head at the last second.

                They would have loved to make us all watch that. It’s a twofer for their sick sadistic nature, deeply traumatizing the good and giving the bad fap murder porn and dragging their souls further into depravity. (And that sadistic set-up really has nothing to do with politics, politics would just be the tool they used to cause trauma.)
No wonder people want it to be a psyop where no one died, as opposed to facing just how sick and soulless these people in charge really are.

        The problem is that people have not recalibrated their expectations for current level of incompetency.  Nobody who knows even a little bit about rifles and security can believe they’d leave that roof unguarded accidently.  Maybe it was intentional, but with the FBI investigating, we’ll never know.

        &gt;Perhaps we return to the old gods or maybe some new version of the Christian God.
One of the unfortunate effects of enlightenment thinking is the degradation of ancient folk beliefs that functioned hand-in-hand with Christian society. I’m thinking the fairies for traditional Irish people, Drudes and other mystical creatures for the Germans, etc. Those old folkways are probably not coming back, but something new will take their place.
Christianity is going to move away from both the hyper-rationalist theological deity and the emotive Evangelical “Personal Jesus” to an opaque, mystical, and primal First Force in the universe.

                Well, James Coburn’s character, asoi dissantmilitary commandant named French, convinced them that they were being deceived. The computer, of course, had been telling them the unpalatable–so to speak–truth. French, on the other hand, told the people what they wanted to hear and imbibing that polite fiction got them all killed.
In the postmodern West, who is the computer and who is French?
Gotta love Coburn, by the way. One of the coolest actors of all time.

            These are such stellar comments, both Chet and Wicked, excepting that a move “…to an opaque, mystical, and primal First Force in the universe” is a terrible error.  It won’t satisfy human instincts and needs; it is an obfuscation tried many times by the priests, a back-handed way that prevents, rather than accords, both understanding and satisfaction.
A return to the folkways is a right way; it is the demand that there be an opaque “First” that is the cause of the problem.  I’m saying the ultimate is not, and should not, be a mystery.

        The problem with the term “Conspiracy theory” is it has become weaponized.  Some of the conspiracies I’ve heard are just insane.  Some sound plausible, but some are just out there.  So anything going around that puts the beautiful people in a bad light is just dismissed as a “conspiracy theory”  It’s a “poisoning the well” tactic.  Conflate some reasonable thing with something obviously stupid and insane.  Atheist Michael Shermer is famous for doing this directly.  Equate the target with Bigfoot and UFO abductions. It’s such a scummy tactic.Add in the insane “influencer” who will say anything for attention and money and a need to constantly put something on line and new insane conspiracies are hatched near daily.

        The part of Fukuyama’s book that is correct — I do not wish to enter into a discussion about the rest of it — is what he lifted directly from Kojeve and Nietzsche, which is the concept of “the Last Man.” And Nietzsche was correct. We live among the Last Men. At Kojeve’s time, it was a possibility but not yet a reality. Now we are there.

            What is that “Last Man”? Is it the idea that the ruling classes have gone from mere cynicism to full unbelief?
That is, that there is no possibility of a Judge or even karmic Judgement above them, that they are free to “do as thou wilt, is the whole of the Law”?
Is that what Nietzsche meant, that if men lost God (natural hierarchy), they might find Nothing- not nihilism or hopelessness, no, but the lack of all restraints.

            Seems Fukuyama also mentioned CS Lewis’ concept of “men without chests.” Related to the Last Man, I believe. But we’re beyond that stage now. Not only do men no longer have chests, they have ta-tas instead.

Is that what Nietzsche meant.
You asked a question. I told you to look it up. You didn’t and pretended you knew about it already. Pride, brother.
By the by, you mentioned CS Lewis. Have you looked up the Lewis for yourself yet, or did you expect me to do that for you, too?

        So much about the attempted assassination that doesn’t add up. Where is the curiosity about the shooter, his background, his family? We see “little to no presence on social media” as though that winds things up and best to move on. But what about his presence in meatspace? I presume he had a family, an apartment or dwelling, a circle of acquaintances, maybe narrow but sufficient enough for actual reporters to work out a portrait of the young man.
No curiosity at all.

        Someone wrote here or somewhere else the other day a comment that cuts right through the “incompetence/malice” interminable debate.
Incompetence opens the door for malice and maliciousness. An incompetent person is too stupid to comprehend the very concept, because their sole conceit in life is that they can read the minds of other people and know “what they are thinking.”

        When the authorities lie about everything, when perfidy is the modus operandi then you get conspiratorial thinking. How could you not. When this perfidy reigns, then effectively chaos rules.In the 20th century Saturn (Kronos) ascended. Why? Well, the people that worship him took charge. Our Greco-Roman ancestors gave us the knowledge. Jupiter (Zeus) rebelled agains Saturn. Saturn was eating his children. Jupiter (Zeus) found the courage and the force of will to kill the tyrant. What were they killing? Chaos! Tyranny is a dysfunctional cause and amplifier of chaos.Incidentally, more proof that we are all the same people, the Nordic cosmology has the same wisdom embedded in it. Odin and his brothers Vili and Ve were birthed by a Giant (think Titan). This giant was sucking all of the resources in the cosmos dry. So, like Jupiter, Odin, Vili and Ve killed him. Western man, facing existential peril has been given the wisdom that he has time and again acted upon. We threw off the yoke of the parasitic tyrant.One could read Christ as yet another rebellious Son. His path was self-sacrifice to conquer chaos. He ascended to heaven to provide the logos and temper Saturn.Perhaps, that works when everyone accepts the Son, but when you live in the midst of those who deny that and worship Saturn and his promise to you and yours alone, compassion and logos isn’t going to get it done.In the end, Western man faces the end. We know who we are. Our God is Dyeus who in derivatives of our mother tongue is called Odin, Zeus and Jupiter. More and more it seems our ancestors call out from the primordial mist and demand the return of Jupiter.

            I really like Carlson, but I used to cringe and change the channel when he started talking about aliens.  With billions of cell phone cameras on the planet, it’s alway a grainy military camera that captures the images.  I can’t imagine who would benefit from keeping the population scared enough to support outrageously large military budgets.

                Why is it so hard to believe that with trillions of planets out there? We are nothing but one of God’s ant farms. (Alternatively, maybe this is heaven and everything else out there as hell as the Bible hints.)I was watching the documentary on the Varginha, Brazil alien crash called “Moment of Contact.” Not completely convinced after watching, but I have an open mind to it and it was interesting nonetheless.(It was on Tubi, not sure where it’s showing now.)But what really got me thinking was the interview with the movie producer James Fox. He wasn’t a huckster and he isn’t a flake. What Fife Symington told him really stood out.https://youtu.be/gXmLpLeR0hk?feature=shared

            I don’t know about the multiple gunman but I am sure the FBI will eventually treat us to the lone wolf would be assassin explanation.  I could be wrong but I very much doubt that this particular kid planned and executed this by himself.

            Alex Jones is the greatest performance artist of an age unworthy of his greatness.
Yesterday I watched someone I’d never heard of imitate Ethan Ralph by interviewing someone named Alex Jones who pulled off a perfect late-stage, pre-aneurysmal Alex Jones imitation: the man smoked and drank (vodka, right out of the bottle) while talking nonstop for an hour before spending the last ten minutes of his performance visibly not-vomiting.

                This isn’t about the FBI’s credibility. It’s about how their public stance is characterized in the original post here.“The FBI rushing out to say he was just another lone wolf in their system, one that always seems to know about these guys before they commit a crime, also raises eyebrows.”Their public stance is the opposite of that, based on the post on the FBI website that I quoted from.

        I’d like to note that you just commented in a recent article about how Thiel’s influence was akin to some sort of conspiracy theory. Now Vance, a former Thiel employee bank-rolled by him, is going to be VP. Your favorite technocrat Musk–also Thiel linked–is also backing Trump.Increasingly my conspiracy theories I share with others have predictive power, while yours remain light speculation that goes nowhere and appears to be designed to go nowhere like everything on the alt-media, aka appears to be little more than propaganda. Since the alt-media also increasingly appears to have always been a front to stoke populists and nationalists to demand a control grid through a smart wall…well, bring the downvotes, ladies.

            You lose the thread when you call Musk my favorite technocrat. I have been a harsh critic of Musk for a long time. The Theil-conspiracy stuff works on Zoomers, because they live online and do not know anything. Thiel is pretty much a boomer in his politics. There is nothing all that remarkable about his politics.

                Yes, you and Musk. No one could ever say you’re into him. You’ve never written in favor of what could be called “globalist conservatives.” I don’t recall you ever being seriously critical of Musk, Thiel, or Yarvin.Like with today’s article, there always feels like an angle. Today’s being to dismiss the underlining conspiracy talk in right-wing circles that events of the past few days feel very coincidental. How’s that bandaged ear doing with polling? People re-energized after you demoralized them on democracy for the past few years? Are you going to tell us that Trump will save us again this time for real FOR REAL FOR REAL? He’s learned!No one can look at Thiel’s connections with Palantir and the smart wall and concur he’s a boomer about his politics.

                        I’ve read you for a very long time and looked recently again. All light pieces made to look like criticism but which uphold the underlining viewpoint.
Don’t think I don’t notice you ignoring much of what I’m saying, I’ll assume because you’re conceding the main points while trying to evade.

        I’ll give you another argument why it’s not crazy to think that the assassination attempt might be a psyop: Jeffrey Epstein. Do you really believe the cameras were broken? Did you see the picture of Epstein on the gurney? It was all just too weird to be believable.

        &gt;which was long before the Central Intelligence Agency existed.
The Russians, in the form of the Cheka/NKVD used deception/maskirovka, esp in their operation called The Trust.  Sydney Reilley of the SIS was called a conspiracy theorist in the 1920s by the British Foreign Office for doubting the Official Narrative.

        Re: ConspiraciesWhat does your gut tell you about the Roe v Wade leak at the Supreme Court? My gut told me that it was an officially sanctioned leak, to release the pressure valve for when the decision comes out, so that lefties don’t destroy everything. Normies are still waiting for them to find the leaker.Don’t believe anything they tell you anymore. That’s why I don’t think you’re sticking your neck out too far by saying that a so-called assassination attempt, where Private Bone Spurs gets nicked and gets to parade around with a bandage on his ear as qualifying him for a purple heart, was fake.I like Trump and I enthusiastically voted for him in 2016. Not so enthusiastic about Sikh prayers at the Republican convention and ushering in a new set of overlords. To be honest, I’d rather keep the Jews as overlords, even if they are lefties. They at least aren’t completely from an alien culture.

        Vox Day had some thoughts recently on Nietzsche.
Turns out Nietzsche spend the last years of his life drinking his own piss.
The last sentence ZMan wrote reminded me of that. In the end, everyone is left with their own mind. The conspiracy theorists will be left in a mirror palace of their mind, assuming a conspirary around each corner.

            In recent years a few of our big-name guys—Vox Day and the “Martyr Made” fed first come to mind—have taken up defaming the West’s (Whiteness’s) greatest non-leftist literary figures as beta/gamma losers, especially Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, the “old right” (you could call them) thinkers rebellious young men best understand and most enjoy, the two proven literary gateways from nihilism to Our Thing (or something like it).I put it down to midwit narcissistic rage when confronted with genius they can only grasp enough to know that it mocks them, but it’s probably best to assume a conspiracy—against you.Trust books, not posts about them.

            Trying to make sense of the contradictions of the God people-without knowing the mechanics-would drive any honest man to drinking his own piss. The sages, priests, and philosophers offered an honest man like Nietzsche nothing but hollow enticements.Their semantics are the mirror palace, a child’s simple picturebook ‘explanation’, explaining nothing. They (you) cannot tell one how any of it actually works, provide no engine diagram beyond moral preening.I laud Vox Day and his effort, but if he thinks his smirking will somehow persuade me to succumb to a Catholic Pope or a Jewish God, he can right kiss my left buttcheek.
