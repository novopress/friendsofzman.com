        Technology killed art.
Art has always had a number of functions ‚Äì among them decoration, beauty, representing reality and most importantly triggering the imagination of the observer such at each person could cast their own interpretation of the depiction.
Mechanistic- chemical photography eliminated the need for art to represent reality.  And moving pictures and video have destroyed the imaginative aspect of art via superior presentation and desensitizing the observing public.
Which is why all modern art is abstract ‚Äì to the point of functioning as Rorschach totems.

        Partly off-topic. I never understood why white liberals and white elite hate ordinary whites. Not talking about other tribes. All elites have always had contempt for ordinary people but not hate. What is different in America?

        When you look at it this way, pop songs are not art because they do not speak to the nature of the society that produces them.

            Frankly, that ranking is ridiculous. Loved it as a 10-year-old. I see it now and it leaves me slightly cold. Ultimately, it‚Äôs a good and rather imaginative kids‚Äô movie with great special effects, nothing more.

                I think you understate it‚Äôs influence on cinema, and the economy around movies.  It reminds of something someone noted about The Matrix: There were action movies made before The Matrix, and action movies made after The Matrix.

        The most innovative contemporary art is the weird avant-garde poetry our hateful rulers use to describe us:
‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù
‚Äúlistless vessels‚Äù
etc.
Decades of dada from Tzara to Ashbery never assembled such awkward nonsense.

        I have a feeling that most of the ‚Äúart‚Äù from this era will be forgotten quickly. In fact, much of it is already (thankfully) forgotten.  Art is supposed to be beautiful and aspirational. Now so much of it is suicidal. So much of it is easily mistaken for rubbish. It‚Äôs all over the art.  Whether it is buildings, music, modern art, movies or works of fiction, much of it is ugly and not uplifting in any way.  There is a ton of modern art which required the technique and skill of a 6 year old to produce with such masterpieces as a blank canvas or a canvas with a black line down the center.There is a Ted Talk (I believe it was a ted thing) where a college art professor explains how he took a zoomed in photo of his painting apron and presented it to his class as art. He basically catches drips and rubs his brush on it to remove excess paint. From the picture, you couldn‚Äôt tell it was an apron because it was zoomed into a couple of square inches.  The students made comments about it being powerful and bold and the like.  Literal random paint spots is mistaken for art and discussed as art in a college art class.  There are lots of stories of janitors throwing parts of an art display into the trash because the ‚Äúart‚Äù is indistinguishable from literal trash.  One xirl put her trashed messy bedroom on display complete with bloody underwear. This was displayed in a major art gallery.It‚Äôs clowns all the way down.

            There is a cool documentary about Jackson Pollack where someone gets a splatter paint canvas from a garage sale and she ends up in the high art world seeing if it is real or fake.The pretentions and stupidity of the modern parenthesis led art world are on full display.Speaking of amazing art, I got my niece and nephew a book on Rome. It was geared toward young people. However, the paintings are lined with color prints of rennaissance, baroque and romantic era masterpieces depicting Roman life. It made my happy that the youngsters have something coming into their eyes and souls that is aspirational.

            Art, like everything else from the elites, is designed to demoralize and abuse you psychologically. Once people who hate you gained control of the culture, they turned the culture into a weapon aimed at you.That‚Äôs it, it is just that simple. Architecture is the same way ‚Äì look at the type of lunatic buildings and their designers that have been celebrated over the past 40 years or so. Look at the Nancy Pelosi Federal Building in San Francisco, nobody can walk by that thing, look at it, and feel pleasant or optimistic. And sure enough it is surrounded by violent, drug addicted hobos living in filth ‚Äì mission accomplished.

                Wow. That Pelosi building is a monstrosity.  The first featured photo I found of it had additional photos showing the hobos and junkies.

        From the late 80s on to today, I‚Äôve noticed that the decline of its popular music precedes the decline of the rest of society. Some, albeit not a tremendous amount, of musical literacy is required to make this assessment. This wasn‚Äôt apparent in the late 80s/early 90s. All that was apparent then was that popular music was declining. Which it has continued to do ever since. With the more obvious decline of AINO following in its wake, which today virtually everyone can see. The music was the canary in the coal mine. An early indicator that the creative force of the society had been spent.Informed by this trend, when you take a listen to the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù that is popular today, it makes the future decline of the society that much more frightful.

        ‚ÄúThis sort of crude entertainment has nothing important to say about the people who produced and consumed it.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs interesting.  I think the crude popular music is a reflection of our cultural degeneracy and decay.  While it is certainly not important in the long term sense because it probably won‚Äôt stand the test of time, I think it does say something about us right now.For all the Boomer posting about their music and how it was the best ever, there is no denying Boomer music is just way, way better than anything on the radio today.  Even the aesthetic of the ‚Äúbands‚Äù is vulgar now.  What does a 300 pound 1/2 naked black woman gyrating to rhythmic log banging say about our society?  Probably something we would rather not know or acknowledge.

        This is not the original topic, but I‚Äôm wondering if any of you guys remember the idea of an ‚Äúedge city‚Äù? I used to think it was the cool new idea but I‚Äôm increasingly of the view that it‚Äôs a scam/ponzi scheme.
Like has anyone ever been to Irvine, ca? I think that‚Äôs supposed to be a typical example of an edge city.

            When I think of edge city I think of The Woodlands, TX. Palm Beach County FL would probably be another.

        I remember after some negro paroxysm‚Äìthe Passion of Floyd? Trayvon Martin verdict?‚ÄìDarius Rucker did a live performance of ‚ÄúWhite Christmas.‚Äù The Left, univocally, flew into a rage. The word white itself, even when not referencing Blue-eyed Ice Devils, when connoted positively, was anathamatized. Could there be much clearer evidence that anti-white racism is what most motivates the Left?

            Ostei Kozelskii: Darius Rucker did a live performance of ‚ÄúWhite Christmas.‚ÄùThe irony there is that (((Israel Beilin))) wrote ‚ÄúWhite Christmas‚Äù as part of a massive cultural-wide effort on the part of the Frankfurt School to secularize the birth of Christ and turn that date into just another excuse for purchasing worthless pieces of plastic junk from j00ish peddlers of pediatric garbage such as (((Mattel))) and (((Barbie))).Cf Beilin‚Äôs subsequent tune, ‚ÄúEaster Parade‚Äù, which began the effort to the secularize of the resurrection of Christ.Cf ‚ÄúRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer‚Äù by (((John David Marks))).[Apparently Peter Cottontail, as the Easter Bunny, is largely a goyische fiction, although personally I am dubious.]

        Perhaps one cannot ‚Äúreboot‚Äù Mozart, but one can remake his operas with a cast of Hutus and in such a way as to push the DIE agenda. And in fact, this sort of thing happens all the time. The people who do this, of course, are uninterested in art except for destroying it. Be that as it may, art can be debased just as easily as pop culture. The crime, however, is far worse.

                That‚Äôs exactly right. The people at the NY Times, among other institutions, have been pushing this, although I‚Äôm not sure if the NY Phil has yet adopted the deranged policy. If not, it can only be a matter of time.One thing that has swept the length of breadth of the classical music world, however, is the mandates for DIE in performance and programming. What this means is that mediocre negro musicians and black compositional hacks are popping up in concerts across the land. (The totally forgettable negress Florence Price is now treated like Mozart.) My local orchestra, which I‚Äôve patronized since the late 80s, has started down this path. I no longer attend its concerts‚Ä¶

                        The ultimate end game here is to destroy classical music performance. If performance is sufficiently degraded through affirmative action, nobody will pay money to attend. And another pillar of white civilization will be reduced to rubble. That which the savages cannot equal, they perforce destroy to hide the evidence of their inferiority.

        But does art stand the test of time because it holds a mirror up to the society in which it was created or because it conveys incredible beauty or timeless ideas that, some would say, are universal? In the case of Greek statuary and architecture, I would argue that its classical beauty is why it is revered now just as much as it was when it was created.

        Readers of the Z-Blog will recall an old theory/prophecy that went as follows:A hundred monkeys pecking away at random on a hundred typewriters will eventually reproduce the complete works of William Shakespeare. The terms may be a little dated, what with the typewriters, and that modest round number, meant to suggest something like ‚Äúmany,‚Äù or even ‚Äúinfinite.‚Äù And one monkey, of course, would suffice, given enough time and an immortal monkey. In any case, the chance duplication would require the monkeys‚Äîlet us say a brigade of monkeys‚Äîto peck out 38 excellent plays and some 160 poems of one metrical beat or another.Is the musty old prophecy at last being fulfilled? We now have millions of monkeys pecking away more or less at random, day and night, on millions of personal computer keyboards. We have ‚Äúword processors,‚Äù the Internet, e-mail, and ‚Äúthe information explosion.‚Äù Futurists at our leading universities tell us the day is at hand when, out of this maelstrom of words, a glorious literature must emerge, and indeed flourish.So far, however, as of today, Tuesday, August 22nd, just after noon, the tally still seems to be fixed at:Shakespeare: 198, Monkeys: 0

            I appreciate the old saying for what it‚Äôs worth and attempts to convey, but the reality is that the probability is so small of such an occurrence, that most likely the universe will *end* before such a feat can be accomplished. Assuming of course, our current understanding of the cosmos remains ‚Äútrue‚Äù.

                    Yes, I‚Äôve been thinking about this.  My knowledge here is limited, but the concept is fascinating as I hear of applied uses.  Can you take an unskilled laborer and make him as competent as a typical garage grease monkey using AI?  So far I‚Äôm getting the impression that ‚Äúyou can lead a horse to water, but can‚Äôt make him drink‚Äù.
It might be that the end effect is to make the good even more competent‚Äîand certainly efficient, while leaving the mediocre behind.

                Yes, if the typing is non-random and biased against it, then works of the bard will never get typed.
For example, if the monkey had a habit of striking 5 keys on the left side followed by 5 keys on the right side, then repeating infinitely, many words/phrases  cannot be typed with that pattern of behavior.

        We throw around the term art and artist as well as great and genius without regard to the standard and standard bearers who are the towering pillars that speak across time. The reality is, what is being made since the 60s and who has been making it is the unraveling of standards and the shambles of the plebian phase of civilization‚Äôs unraveling. That isn‚Äôt to say that some art wasn‚Äôt made and that there weren‚Äôt a few legitimate artists, but one is hard to pressed to find it and them. The institutions that carried forward the highest standards were corrupted at the beginning of the 20th century. They kept the archives, maintained the lineage of pedagogue and protege, and preserved the knowledge of how to train and cultivate craft so that the rare genius who is an artist capable of using the craft to make art could flourish and be invested in.In terms of the plebian output, it is mostly product. Even much of what rebelled against product was a productized and shallow rebellion. It is just a product and then a knock-off of the most recent successful product.I remember leaving a leading institution that preserved that lineage and history that goes back to the plainchant of the monasteries to their early 20th century downfall. I left and realized I had barely scratched the surface. I was fortunate enough to have as my private teacher that true generational genius. Whether or not his art is seen as up to the standard of all time is up to what another maestro used to call, ‚ÄúThe Toilet of Time.‚Äù I remember doing in depth study of a large number of the towering masterworks. One day, both of us were awestruck by Schubert and his Death and The Maiden quartet. I asked, ‚ÄúWhat is it that makes a Bach or a Schubert, Haydn or Mozart so much better than one of the lesser composers?‚Äù My maestro thought about it and said, ‚ÄúI think it is knowing the formulaic response, having total mastery of it, and then going beyond the formula.‚Äù I think that is true, and I think it is only very rare souls who can do that. It is someone who has incredible discipline and work ethic, unsurpassed intelligence, and after decades of study doesn‚Äôt lose their soul. Rather they can unveil and express it fully aware of both the past and their place in the present and make something of undeniable and enduring beauty and depth.The phase we are entered into is one of preservation and in the dark cultivation. In the meantime, most, ‚Äúart‚Äù, and ‚Äúartists‚Äù are moving on from making and being a product to making and being an advertisement of an advertisement of what was once a knockoff of a product. It is Simon Cowell‚Äôs wet dream.On the margins, the makers and connoisseurs of real art will flourish. Someday, there will be a reconnection.I saw an article the other day where China is building entire research centers that are replicas of European masterworks. They are also pumping in classical music. They are searching for the magic sauce of creative genius so they can immerse their researchers in an environment that will make them the leading innovators that The West has traditionally been.I am doubtful that they will be able to copy it. It springs from a soul, a bio-spirit. Time will tell. One thought I had is that perhaps what will be discovered is that that creativity sprang from a people and their place. What if China has such a desire for what The West and only The West so far has produced, that maybe they will conclude that they need to destroy our ruling rabble, restore our people and our homelands so the beauty, art and expression they so admire can spring again from the only source it can.

            Since I have an empiricist temperament, I tend to be skeptical of transcendent ideas like objective beauty or objective quality in art.  However, that same temperament makes me notice your report that ‚ÄúChina is building entire research centers that are replicas of European masterworks. They are also pumping in classical music.‚Äù
That asians admire western art suggests the existence of an objective standard that transcends particular societies and individual preferences.

                This is true.  As I‚Äôve mentioned before, at the College of Music and Arts at my old university, we have a surfeit of Asians‚Äîand it‚Äôs noticeable.  That tells me that their families and nations appreciate the Western arts, especially classical music.

                    The Conservatory I attended had the piano department filled with young women from Korea, Japan and Taiwan. It was effectively a finishing school for many of them. The level was extremely high. Many of them do not make it as a solo career in classical music is practically impossible. They go there and do there best but will go home and raise a family.They will be music teachers and pass on the skills, knowledge and appreciation of our once towering musical culture to their children. They see great music and skill as a part of forming a full and highly capable person.Meantime, our kids watch negrified Spiderman and listen to pant-hooting over digitally stitched together samples of degenerate music.We must take control over our families and our children as the Asians have. Leaving the kids alone with the TV, internet and sports is only going to lead to more waste in a bigger wasteland.What we can and will do if we put in the effort is preserve the craft and artistry for our posterity, but our genius for self expression will someday reconstitute and those rare geniuses who spring from our people will create new forms whose heights match those of Greece, Rome and Western Europe until the 20th century.If we are willing to make the effort, in a century or two our posterity and the world will reap the rewards. It is a tall order, but we have faced stiffer odds, though never these dire circumstances of being targeted for genocide in our own homelands by our own rulers. Let‚Äôs defy the odds and become deserved legends. It is either that, or forgotten forever.

            It sounds like the Chinese   in your description will be eschewing pretty much everything post 1900 with the possible exception of the Art Deco movement. We should do the same.High art began its hibernation with the late Impressionists. Art Nouveau, while beautiful and often celebrating classic western beauty and themes, rarely reaches the definition of high art.. Too mass produced and completely intertwined with the advent of art/commercial product placement.Dada, modern and post modern art became the avenue for the hacks, the untalented and the morally bankrupt to put on the laurels of ‚Äúartist‚Äù. Even the height of modernism‚Ä¶ the Mid-Century movement, is bereft of any soul. Form is sacrificed to function and an Eames chair cannot even match the simple functuonal beauty of a Shaker dresser or even a 17th Century ox yolk.Movies as a new art form and existing in a time of unprecedented technological growth‚Ä¶ encapsulate the history of art in a shorter time period. You can look at them as a microcosm complete with primitive, high, low, commercial, mass appeal and decline phases condensed to a 100 year span.If you look at the current state of Leftist (I am getting tired of the phrase ‚Äúwoke‚Äù) film-making you can almost make the parallel to the Church‚Äôs influence/restrictions on art in some parts of the Renaissance.While the Church helped fund and produce incredible works of art, at times their demands upon the subject matter inhibited great artists from sallying out into non-Christian themes. At times bigger minds appreciated and supported the celebration of ancient Greco-Roman world, but outside of that‚Ä¶ art was greatly restricted.Hollywood is in this same religious suffocation phase. Their new religion allows for ‚Äúart‚Äù provided it portrays righteous themes and adheres to the religious restrictions. The approved portrayals are tropes now: girls are Mary Sues or girl bosses, homosexuality is beautiful, White men are the villains or weak incompetents, minorities are brilliant and righteous, the past contains only racist ugliness, etc.We are starting to see the worm turn though. Hollywood is hemorrhaging money. Audiences are largely rejecting the doctrinal themes imposed by the Studios. People seem to be hungry for different themes. Top Gun 2 was popular because it was a simple portrayal of the noble warrior. Oppenheimer, while a bit over-rated and clearly Nolan trying to produce Oscar-bait, drew people hungry for something a little more polished and thought evoking. Even Barbie drew crowds of females because (while still being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù) they are desperate for portrayals of women attempting beauty and femininity.We live in interesting times. There are positive changes afoot. We just need to remember what we‚Äôve forgotten and what the Chinese seemed to have discovered.

                In theory film should be the highest art. It should be opera but with moving images and special effects you can‚Äôt do on a stage.I think the apex of film making are the story based films. I think Visconti‚Äôs ‚ÄúIl Gattopardo‚Äù, (The Leopard), is a high point both with the story, (highly relevant to this topic), the music and the aesthetics. I think some modern TV series came close. The first four seasons of ‚ÄúThe Last Kingdom‚Äù, was great until they vandalized it with, ‚Äúdiversity.‚Äù I turned it off when the 9th century black monk was introduced. I am not going to watch that garbage or support it in any way.In any case, film has huge potential but in a mercantile society, it has and will struggle to reach it. Of course, the least artistic of any of film are the art films. Those things are wretched!

            Because those societies are materially rich but spiritually and morally bankrupt. Also, they are set up to churn out highly technical workers and build businesses. That edifice is set up not to make art or beauty, but to make product and make the green line keeping going up and to the right.
The financier and merchant‚Äôs dream is a nightmare.

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶the same reason no one will talk about Madonna songs in the 22nd century. This sort of crude entertainment has nothing important to say about the people who produced and consumed it.‚Äù
Or perhaps it says that the people who produced and consumed it were not important enough to remember.

            Point made, but perhaps with too broad a brush.  Since you‚Äôve picked Madonna to hang your music point on, I‚Äôll use her as well.Your claim that Madonna songs are purely ‚Äúpop‚Äù with little to no underlying meaning and hence societal value, let me reference one of her early hit songs, ‚ÄúPapa Don‚Äôt Preach!‚ÄùHere‚Äôs a verse underlying the song‚Äôs point/meaning:‚ÄúPapa don‚Äôt preach I‚Äôm in trouble deepPapa don‚Äôt preach, I‚Äôve been losing sleepBut I made up my mind, I‚Äôm keeping my baby, hmI‚Äôm gonna keep my baby, hm‚ÄùThis song became popular in the midst of the societal uproar concerning the legalization of abortion rights.  At that time, one tact was to persuade young women to forgo abortion and ‚Äúkeep‚Äù their babies rather than abort.  Madonna‚Äôs song directly addresses that and the pressure a young women can feel from her father wrt his disappointment in her behavior.  I‚Äôm sure this song talked to a million young women of the time with ‚Äúdaddy issues‚ÄùI‚Äôm not sure that the knock on modern music should be that it is short lived, meaningless escapism.  I suspect that‚Äôs a design feature of the genre. To that effect, let‚Äôs recall ‚Äúpop‚Äù music of the late 1800‚Äôs, ‚ÄúBicycle Built For Two‚Äù:‚ÄúDaisy, Daisy, give me your answer doI‚Äôm half crazy all for the love of youIt won‚Äôt be a stylish marriageI can‚Äôt afford a carriageBut you‚Äôll look sweet upon the seatOf a bicycle built for two‚ÄùCan‚Äôt image a more meaningless‚Äîbut pleasant‚Äîmelody and lyrics.

                Those lyrics are wretched. They make Hallmark cards sound like The Bard‚Äôs prototype.Don‚Äôt lecture me daddy. I got knocked up and I am going to have this illegitimate child. Eh‚Ä¶. Not so much.One thing that has high artistry is Chris Cornell‚Äôs cover of Billie Jean. He nailed that song. If there is a pop song about an illegitimate child and a deep soul who understood the text that would be it.What a difference between a crotch grabbing skeleton under a grease mop singing that song with massive affectation and weird turrets noises coming out and the master poet and singer Chris Cornell getting ahold of that song and absolutely nailing the essence of it. Artistry that has to say something vs. performative angst that has to sell something.

                    The language sung is the language of the people at that time.  Shakespearean poetic it is not, but that was not the claim.  The claim was that it was not meaningless.  It has a very topical point for the time.  Who writes in Old English these days?  Even Beowulf is most often read today in modern language translation.  It loses none of its import as such.

Solomon wearing a Kangol and gold chains and being a gold plated gangsta in a jacuzzi in a climactic scene would be hot!We also need an Oppenheimer or Einstein film where his black assistants pen the theories and have the key insights that were essential.I would love to see the hand wringing and kvetching that would inspire.

        It is simultaneously funny and sad to see what is going on around pop culture today. The entertainment industry of the USA completely ran out of ideas (both good and bad) somewhere in the mid-2000s, and turned to cannibalism. Disney‚Äôs entire operating model for the past decade has been to make stuff it already made, when it was a far better company, and then to buy another company and remake their stuff. It worked for a while because the dominant consumers were happy to spend new money to consume old stuff again, but that well is running dry and there are no new wells. It just speaks to the intellectual and creative bankruptcy of our age, another sign that the American project has run out of steam.The fact is that our culture is moving on from the long shadow that the boomer youth has cast upon it, and all their stuff will soon be forgotten. Stuff like Star Wars and the Beatles seemed eternal for a long time, but it turns out it is not. The younger people don‚Äôt want to watch the 5th release of a 1985 movie or a 10th remastering of a 1965 album, which is why they are turning to the exports of other countries (like Korea and Japan) for their entertainment. We are moving to a multipolar world not just militarily, not just politically, but culturally.

            I‚Äôve never thought much of the Beatles‚Äô music was timeless or enduring. It always sounded dated to me. I‚Äôm sure it was a big deal at the time, which was a little before my time. I guess you had to be there. I give more credit to Leo Fender, Orville Gibson, and the Ludwig brothers than I do to the quartet from Liverpool. I figure after what the former did, the latter was inevitable.

        The progressives have you on this one. They will tell you that ruling class taste forms the canon of artistic worth from age to age. Many technicians can explain why the Mona Lisa is great art. Critics can rhapsodize about the subtlety and nuance that enrapture their souls. Trouble is they‚Äôre after the fact when what they behold has already been deemed great art. It‚Äôs said that the English never saw a sunset ‚Äôtil Turner painted them. And today‚Äôs mystique‚Äôs burning question: is Mona Lisa trans?If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears the Brothers Grim nor sees the original Disney version, will the Bowdlerized Snow White be deemed great art to last a millenium? We have no way to judge but to vaunt our biases. Infuriating.

        Not all art is transcendent, and even the art that stands the test of time is only possible if the succeeding society is still of sufficient quality to appreciate it. For example, very few within our current Western society is actively appreciative of classical music, fine art, great architecture, or eternal literature. IOW, there are no museums in Africa for a reason.And that is the real story that must be told. Our species is in decline. The best cohorts of us are dwindling at an accelerating rate, both through dilution and evaporating fecundity. Natural selection is dead and has been replaced by an artificial variant of suicide by negligence. Affluence means that there is no price to be paid for stupidity, and hence there is no longer any driver for excellence.The death of timeless art is a lagging indicator of how far we have fallen.

            Too true, TomA.
To advance a seemingly trite example, think of the use of classical music in a number of the Bugs Bunny cartoons. Without the wider acquaintance in the culture with this repertoire, they would never have been made as they were. Then move on to the collaboration of Stokowski and the Disney studios to generate Fantasia, the theme music of the TV show, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, being Reznicek‚Äôs Overture to Donna Diana, or the theme music for The Lone Ranger being a section of Rossini‚Äôs William Tell Overture. More examples could be adduced.

        Art requires two things, from my definition. First, it must hold a mirror up to general human nature ‚Äì even if that mirror is distorted a la a house of mirrors. This would be the timeless/ universal aspect. Two, experiencing art must be a passive one. The audience must first submit to the author‚Äôs perspective (e.g. watching a film silently, looking at a picture, reading a book), and then they can respond. Media such as video games cannot be art, for their entire schtick is making action that empowers the player instead of forcing them to submit to the author‚Äôs perspective. Games respond to input ‚Äì it should be the other way around.

        The reason no one thinks about the pop songs of the 19th centuryA lot of 19th century pop songs simply made it into the general cultural vocabulary and we still know them todayOh, SusannaI‚Äôve Been Working On the RailroadBattle Hymn of the RepublicDixieThose were all popular 19th century songs. Not to mention the Star Spangled Banner itself.There‚Äôs an enormous body of Christian song from the 19th century, many of which my church sings at worship on Sundays. They were popular tunes of that time.Yankee Doodle is 18th century and the tune is much olderGreensleeves is older than that.The best and most influential pop music of each era survives the passage of time.We have such a large body of classical music (Romantic, Classical, Baroque, etc.) because there was such an organized system of preservation and performance. Some classical music was also ‚Äúpop music‚Äù of its day.

        One thing about movie making that few people know about is that it‚Äôs a perfect vehicle for money laundering.  All kinds of bills flow through, from craft service to ‚Äúdesign consultancy.‚Äù  One of the best ways to move money into the system is to have a complex invoicing system for expensive artistic trades.  What does a wig cost anyway?  So if a movie ‚Äúloses money,‚Äù sure, but it may have done its job in other ways.  You would never see this with real art.  The first rule of defining art is that it was intended to be so from inception, and not for other nefarious or duplicitous reasons.When Marcel Duchamp put a urinal on display in 1917 and called it art, ushering in a new age of degeneracy in art, his intention was not making art, if anything it was deconstructing and destroying art, therefore it should not be considered art.

            Please elaborate on the money laundering angle. In common vernacular, the phase ‚Äúmoney laundering‚Äù refers to clearing cash money derived from illicit activity (e.g., drug sales) and so is usually done by cash businesses. Laundromats and car washes come to mind.
Movie studios are not cash businesses. How would a movie studio launder money? Also, the studio is paying out money, not taking it in.

                I don‚Äôt take that strict of a definition.  WRT movies, it involves the hiding of profit from the bottom line and that in effect reduces obligations to investors and Uncle Sam.  The terminology may be wrong, but I get the intended description of the process/motivation.

        Beauty in the eye of the beholder and all, the very definition of ‚Äòbeauty‚Äô has been gang-raped and uglified by our miserably decadent, perverted insect overlords. You can very well bet that there are people out there who have managed to convince themselves that Piss Christ is ‚Äòart‚Äô and Titian‚Äôs The Penitent Magdalene is trash, that ookish Michelle Obama is ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô and Lovely Melania Trump is a homely tramp.I can‚Äôt help but notice the yawning chasm of difference between literally anything built in ancient Rome or Greece and what is slapped together today and passes for ‚Äòarchitecture‚Äô. Did we collectively lose our sense of beauty and refinement? Or is ugliness being forced on us, beaten into us, demanded from us by the new order which seeks to erase the glorious past in advancing their evil agenda? How many kids today only know of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello as animated green mutant superheroes?

                    It is more punitive than palliative, though. As you convinced me, PoMo is rank nihilism. Feeling better about oneself is secondary to making others feel worse. Beauty is hated more because it gives others pleasure than due to any perceived sleight, which is certainly a thing although not the main one. Beauty has to be destroyed because it is beautiful.

            I can‚Äôt help but notice the yawning chasm of difference between literally anything built in ancient Rome or Greece and what is slapped together today and passes for ‚Äòarchitecture‚Äô. Did we collectively lose our sense of beauty and refinement?I‚Äôve posited before that economic efficiency is the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù of beauty. If you need something turned out quickly it won‚Äôt have the fine details and flowing curves of a hand made Roman, Greek, or even Medieval castle or cathedral. Plus side, you get houses people can afford or buildings that can be put up rather quickly. Minus side you get things that all look the same and become forgettable. I‚Äôve made the analogy of the Model T: Designed to be stamped out by the hundreds of thousands, it wasn‚Äôt a very aesthetically ‚Äúpretty‚Äù car. It did what it needed to do, but Ford got surpassed by GM because GM figured out styling sold cars as much as mechanicals.Or is ugliness being forced on us, beaten into us, demanded from us by the new orderGoing back to automobiles I‚Äôd say yes. In the past car styling changed year to year, with cars having a two or three year styling ‚Äúcycle‚Äù, where by the final year enough little bibs and bobs were changed that it looked different enough from the original design to keep bringing people in. Car stylists tried to ‚Äúlead the market‚Äù and suss out what future styling trends were in time to get the new iron into the showroom. Sometimes they nailed it (1955-56-57 Chevrolet), sometimes they missed badly (1958-60 Edsel, Lincoln, 1960-62 Chrysler Corporation cars), but they were personal visions of the designers.Now? Well The Government had to get involved and first fuel economy, and later safety became prominent. Governmental regulations mean every car looks pretty much like every other because there‚Äôs only so many ways to slip through the air to get that last foot of fuel economy. Why bother changing the styling because we have to spend money on the safety features and a 10 speed automatic transmission?At least we still have cars, for now. And houses.

                There‚Äôs another way in which wealth is the enemy of beauty. Hence, when the common man has plenty of disposable income, he is free to ‚Äúvote‚Äù on what is beautiful, or if beauty even matters, with his dollars. And the common man, alas, rarely has a refined aesthetic sense. He is far more likely to appreciate Jay Z than Leos Janacek. And those who produce ‚Äúculture‚Äù cater to the dollar wad, not the elite stratum.

                    I dunno Rembrandt managed to convey the timeless ugliness of the rich merchants who hired him to paint them.
I always wondered if the merchants were happy about how the paintings came out though.

                        I‚Äôm certain the merchants were satisfied.  Beauty seems to change with the times as has been noted.  The merchants probably wanted that look as it suited the perceived ‚Äúdignity‚Äù of their societal status.  Today, not so much.

                        Rembrandt‚Äôs merchants may have leaned toward homely, but chances are they had better taste than the Dutch peasants. And they, along with the upper bourgeoisie, were the only ones with the wherewithal to dictate beauty.

            Beauty has well defined objective components (golden ratio and all that), thus ugly is being forced upon us.  Sure, one man‚Äôs 10 may be another‚Äôs 8, but they both know a 2 when they see one.

        Are movies art?Darn it Z, could you just post a political analysis and let us make snarky comments instead of getting all philosophical? Now we have to think. üòíYou ask ‚Äúis it art?‚Äù and I could riff on Justice Potter Stewart and reply ‚ÄúI know it when I see it.‚Äù But that‚Äôs trite. Your central thesis seems to be capital A art has to have longevity and either express a timeless message or be a mirror on the culture that created it.OK, I shall give you that and agree that no modern sculptor could recreate Michelangelo‚ÄôsDavidorPieta, nor could a modern painter recreate his Sistine Chapel paintings, much less the Dutch Masters like Rembrandt or Vermeer. Partially it‚Äôs a change in the view of that branch of capital A art from the product of the creator to the personality of the ‚Äúartist‚Äù. To be an ‚Äúartist‚Äù these days is to be talked about for Who You Are, not What You Make.Ah, but movies and plays. Well there I‚Äôd say yes it can be capital A art if it calls back to deeper tropes, memes, and themes within society or shared human experience. That Shakespeare fellow wrote for his time and place and yet his plays get performed as is or reimagined for generations.Hamlet,Julius Caesar,King Lear,Macb, oops, ‚ÄúThe Scottish Play‚Äù (don‚Äôt want to curse the Z Blog), evenRomeo and Julietspeak to common human themes (Power, the lust for it, and the dangers of chasing it, love, conflict, revenge) that make them timeless past the language within.Likewise I would say movies can be Art in the sense that visually they do have memorable scenes or staging that inspire other filmmakers (The Odessa Steps scene inBattleship Potemkin, The creation of robot Maria inMetropolis(and the actor playing Rotwang setting the standard template for The Mad Scientist for decades), The Monolith in2001: A Space Odyssey) and can be recognized or remembered. Further I would say a movie can be Art if, as you point out, it utilizes societal tropes or memes effectively that can be seen as timeless (Chasing power and it‚Äôs corrupting influence, Good vs. Evil, Boy meets Girl, Embarking on Great Voyages, etc.) What worked for the originalStar Warscame to me seeing an exhibit on it in Chicago‚Äôs Field Museum over twenty years ago and seeing a portion on how it drew from societal tropes (The reluctant hero plucked from obscurity, mentored by an elder/wizard/Holy Man, sent on a voyage, building a band of warriors, facing and overcoming many dangers, and finally facing down Evil in a final battle).To your point people have forgotten we are Telling a Story and want to Send a Message. Or, Give a Lecture if you prefer. People don‚Äôt want to Get a Lecture, they want to be Told a Story. The younger generation doesn‚Äôt know how to Tell a Story because everything that came before is racist, sexist, and causes cancer. No, we MUST Give a Lecture because we must Change The World. And we can‚Äôt draw on Shared Human Experiences because Cultural Appropriation or something, even though there are stories and themes that transcend time.TL:DR, I think movies are Art if they thread the needle between ‚ÄúLight, Sweet, and Forgettable‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeavy, Dark, and you WILL Change Your Attitude!‚Äù You want something that entertains, but can make you think deeper.Now, could you post tomorrow about the Clintons potentially getting back into the 2024 Presidential race? I‚Äôll bring the snark.

To respectfully add to your list of memorable scenes (from LOTR, a masterpiece of good vs evil, honor, loyalty, sacrifice), the scene where Arowin gives up her immortality to be with Aragon, ‚Äúfor just one lifetime‚Äù, always gets me.

                https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z5t17_D4s90&amp;feature=shareHere is a breakdown of the score of the scene in the opening of The Two Towers. The level of detail that went into the score is impressive. The theme originally revolves around the Dwarves fear of the Balrog gradually rising to the Quenya word Mettana! To the End. The battle with Gandalf and The Balrog invoke Lucifer‚Äôs fall from Heaven. I remember reading the books as a kid, then enjoying the films. That scene and the piece of music in particular always struck me. With the passage of time, and good natured slightly spergy fellows like the man who curates this sight, the depth of the effort and artistic endeavour that went in to the score is shown to be appreciated. Its bittersweet also, as you look and observe the barren wasteland that we have to muddle through. It does seem with what happens and Disney, and Amazon‚Äôs rings of power that the desecration of beauty is done more out of spite than anything else.P.s Personally i always found the score that played during Boromirs passing with Aragorn to be very subtle and beautiful. When you read the breakdown of the score you can get an appreciation of Howard Shore‚Äôs genius. The shame, guilt and regret of Boromir, and his hope as he dies that all is not gone, he didn‚Äôt die in vain. Well worth a listen.

            ‚Äú You want something that entertains, but can make you think deeper.‚Äù
Seems you‚Äôve defined ‚Äúmovie‚Äù art in one way‚Äîmessage, meaning.  That could be done in written format as well.  To me, another important form of movies is visual effect.  As mentioned, LOTR‚Äôs has superiority in both, but other movies can be art with less emphasis on story.  One comes to mind, ‚ÄúThe Horseman‚Äù, with Omar Sharif.  Set in Afghanistan the photography is like a travelogue.  The story however is nothing little better than average.

                That‚Äôs why I often rented foreign films, or watched a bit of tv with the sound off and music  on.
On a tiny battery-powered tv, I sat at the Vince Lombardi rest area in Secaucus and watched Chinese soap opera.
Didn‚Äôt understand a word, but I understood *everything* in the story.  It was a classic!

        Disgusting garbage like Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain or Malevich‚Äôs Black Square are still remembered over a century later. Is that art?I know it is not, but art experts claim that not only it is art, but it‚Äôs also revolutionary and even better than what was before.

Your comment prompted me to look up the ‚ÄúFountain‚Äù by Duchamp.
I laughed out loud when it popped on my screen. That kind of shit is the submission of an individual with no talent or creativity.
The fact that ‚Äúexperts‚Äù consider it important, tells you all you need to know about that tripe.
I‚Äôm pretty sure the commentators on this site have put an end to the credibility of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.

            You have to look at the CIA programs to astroturf the so called ‚Äúmodern art‚Äù from the 40s. They can force unnatural things on us as long as they are active and have control over money that is what gives them free energy to manufacture consent. When the empire decays all the fake stuff will perish with it as this crip is not going to hold long term.But it helps to notice the fakery in the present as it weakens its hold on your spirit. One thing to notice is how our matrix (speaking as a Gen X here) was constructed on narrative that accepted their authority without any meaningful scrutiny (I have visited the MOMA in NYC several times unironically LOL). Notice how today every garbage cultural product is revolutionary, groundbreaking, brave, questions the status quo (all labels to imply deity like awe, like they are geniuses that also faced adversity under an oppressive dogma and they conquered). But we know all is garbage, but for some reason our monkey brains still worry about fake praise neurotically.If you conquer you neurosis you‚Äôll sleep like a baby knowing that Duchamp‚Äôs urinal is not art and no amount of demonic word magic can make it into a product of genius. Someday maybe some crazy weirdo may vandalize it during its 15min of fame (15min in historic time = a century), it would be fun to watch. But if nothing happens to it, it will fade away anyways.

Don‚Äôt use this to prevent a visit if in NYC.  Museums are a mixture of the good and profane these days.  You‚Äôll never see the difference if you don‚Äôt go.  You can bypass the trendy and profane and take a seat in front of ‚ÄúWashington Crossing the Delaware‚Äù.  Breathtaking and thought inducing.

        There is a definite transition from ‚Äúre-imagining‚Äù art, i.e., politicizing it, to outright destruction. Confederate iconography often was great art and makes for a good example. The vandalism has transitioned from removal and placement in museums with ‚Äúcontextualization‚Äù (Nathan Bedford Forrest, Tennessee) to blatant destruction (Robert E. Lee, Virginia). To usher in Year Zero all art from the before times has to be destroyed.So, to answer your question about film: yes. What has been done to SONG OF THE SOUTH is Exhibit A. It originally was ‚Äúcontextualized‚Äù but, as you point out, has been destroyed outside of a few digital ghettos where attempts will be made to ruthlessly purge it even there. I can‚Äôt put my finger on the exact reason for the reason, but pop music does not have the same impact as film. It obviously has something to do with the visual vs. the auditory medium, but as you also point out classical music may be the highest expression of Western art, so that explanation isn‚Äôt complete.Confederate statues still stand in many towns, and SONG remains accessible, albeit with difficulty, thus Year Zero never fully arrives everywhere despite best efforts. Look for Beethoven and Mozart to be ‚Äúre-imagined‚Äù soon, but like all else the subsequent memoryholing never will be one hundred percent. The flickering, barely discernible embers keep lunatics awake at night.

            On pop v. film:
Sinatra gave the American music business the idea that selling music *just happens* once you‚Äôve sold the image of the celebrity. He was a great musician, but that‚Äôs not why the girls were screaming and peeing themselves, and music‚Äôs not what they were paying for when they bought his records. There had been pop-star hysterias (‚ÄúLisztomania‚Äù) before, but there was no ‚Äúmass man‚Äù (teenage girls) to fleece. Since Ol‚Äô Blue Eyes hit the newsreels, successful pop musicians have been visual artists‚Äîor visual art. Music is some of the sound that accompanies them.

        Some truly great popular culture can become art ‚Äì I mean, Shakespeare and Rossini and Wagner were creating what was in their time popular culture, but because it was such great popular culture, it transcended its genre and became art. Will some of our popular culture, er, transition like this? Probably not, but you never know. In  particular,  the popular music of the 1920-1960 period produced some exceptional songs.

            Whitney:  The original translations of the stories of the Brothers Grimm were quite dark.  My father bought a copy of such when I was a tween, and I remember being shocked.  How ironic that even our older and sanitized versions are verboten today.  These tales were meant to instill folk wisdom in children, as well as both entertain and frighten.

                Dang.  Those stories were what we‚Äôd call horror movies, today.  ‚ÄòDark‚Äô doesn‚Äôt do justice.  Shocking, really.But, I was young, and I had a Grimm‚Äôs book with fabulous art.  I didn‚Äôt realize how fabulous.Riding the bus, a lithographer, stunned, asked if he could look at what I was reading.  He pronounced the illustrations as magnificent, and asked if I could possibly give it to him.Young, uncertain, and foolish.Of course it was quickly lost, with all else, soon after.How, how I wish I could return, to give an unnoticed treasure to someone who knew and appreciated its measure, that he might preserve it.  (It was very old.)

        If you think about for just a moment, they are not remaking ‚ÄúSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs‚Äù.They are making a movie with a mystery meat female that is not white as snow, no dwarfs, and  a major theme of the movie (the power of love, and its first kiss), is traded for Boss girl.None of those things (a Snow White female, dwarfs, loves first kiss), are in the movie, hence, it‚Äôs not really a remake.

            I recently purchased some White Cloud Mountain minnows and needed names.  Riffing off the seven dwarves I came up with Greedy, Moody, Sexy, Silly, Shi**y and Esquire [there were only six minnows].
That‚Äôs all I have to say about a Snow White remake.

        Based on my family‚Äôs reactions to these great classics, I‚Äôd say that Snow White and Dumbo are equally great, and not far behind are Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, etc‚Ä¶We shall not see their like again in our lifetime, and maybe not ever‚Ä¶But if civilization survives, the great works of Disney will be revived and watched by children in centuries to come‚Ä¶.

        Reusing my Green Door comment:The one quibble is that I‚Äôd found Sleeping Beauty superior to Snow White, though both are very good. Also the discussion reminds me of the video games as art discussion where it is pointed out that while art is in video games, it‚Äôs debatable if they are true art taken as a whole. The experience, even more so than film, is just too transient and technology based.

            The Metal Gear Solid series is art, at least the first 4, haven‚Äôt played the rest. The 2nd installment is especially challenging. Final Fantasy VI, too. Steampunk aesthetic + fantasy/magic + Bach-inspired soundtrack was a powerful combination. FFVII was beautiful and revolutionary, but I‚Äôm not sure it has the depth. Xenogears is an unfinished masterpiece. Real shame they apparently ran over time and budget, and had to rush the second disc. Could‚Äôve been the GOAT, probably still is in terms of story, imo‚Äî if you have the stomach for Gnostic themes. Chrono Trigger gets a lot of deserved hype, but I think it‚Äôs ultimately a sum-greater-than-parts sort of thing. (Dating myself lol.)Otoh, I‚Äôm not sure great art is possible lately, my bias towards video games notwithstanding. Vulgarity has triumphed. Certainly the visual arts, architecture, music, and theater have been dead for a while.Film is too artificial and passive to my mind. It‚Äôs a feast for the senses, but as flat as the screen it‚Äôs projected on imo.

                As far as Metal Gear they‚Äôre soon to release a remade Snake Eater which I thought was the best of the series.Not gonna lie, the ending of FFX made me teary eyed, but how do I sell someone on the experience.  It‚Äôs one thing to make someone sit through a two hour movie, quite another to get someone to sink 60-ish hours into a game.  The length though is what gives it an emotional investment (i.e., if you just sat down and watched the cutscenes it wouldn‚Äôt have anywhere near the same impact, in any).I guess the game I think of is Destiny which has amazing music, controls, character and level design, etc.  From an ‚Äúart‚Äù perspective it‚Äôs as good or better than any Final Fantasy game, but the experience is soulless, like interacting with a very well designed slot machine.

                The Xenosaga trilogy is pretty brilliant too.My favorite ‚Äúgames as art‚Äù argument is and always will be Killer7. A game about the nature of political power, the grand chess board, the way nations and great powers think, and how democracy is a dumb sham (seriously, that‚Äôs the entire overriding message of the game and the last level in particular, how easy it is to game a democratic system).It‚Äôs also one of the most bizarre looking things you‚Äôll ever see, which is just icing on the cake. Top tier soundtrack and voice acting. Okay gameplay. One of the exceedingly few fictional stories I‚Äôve ever seen that manage to be about politics without being ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù, I guess I‚Äôd put it. Like, given that it came out in 2005 it never says ‚Äúlol bush is bad‚Äù or whatever, it instead says ‚Äúdemocracy is bad and conspiracy is the natural way of man, so you have to assume any grand schemes your nation is playing towards are corrupt and not what they say they are‚Äù. Fantastic game. Play it on steam or the gamecube, the PS2 version is a broken mess. Now you know.

                    Thanks, lads, for the look into the inscrutable.
Ever since I saw Galaxia on an Atari, played on a tv in 1977, I wanted a game.
Sadly, still no- but now, I kinda get it.
(And yeah, Final Fantasy the Movie was fantastic.  The detail!  Her eyes, her hair, at the end!
I snuck in at a theatre, jumping between movies, near the Bronx I think.)

                    Was thinking someone might mention ol‚Äô Xenosaga as I have an (old) review on my never-updated blog:https://www.toadlickgames.com/xenosaga-iii/TDLR: I was torn on this as the super-larger than life setting was more ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù than actual Star Wars: bigger sets, bigger characters, etc. The ending though was a train wreck (where half the train cars just disappeared).
To your point though, if dialog, sets, characters, etc are enough to make a movie ‚Äúart‚Äù then the Xenosaga games are art on steroids since there‚Äôs a metric ton of that stuff in there.

                Sons of Libertyis still my favorite Metal Gear. I haven‚Äôt finished playingPhantom Pain; I‚Äôm probably a fourth of the way through it, but it‚Äôs so vast that I might not ever finish.
For video games as art, one cannot forgetOcarina of Time,which is perhaps the most perfectly balanced game ever made. That, and theMetroid Primeseries.
