        Nobody publishes the math behind an increase in the minimum wage. How much would a $1 McDonalds hamburger rise in price with $15 wages? One percent? Ten percent? I would happily pay ten percent more for everything I buy if low level workers got a livable wage.

        The math is kind of misleading. Looking at more primary sources one learns he is claiming he needs 80k of *sales* to pay for the increase of the wages. My first interpretation of the story made it seem like it would literally cost him 80k to do so. This seemed really queer to me and after running the numbers this is not the case.He claims he has one employee as a clerk for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week per store. That is 3650 hours, assuming no holidays. He has 2 stores for a total of 7300 hours. From what I can tell they are currently being paid 10.50 an hour. A increase to 15.00 an hour is a 4.50 difference. 7300 * 4.50 is 32850, an approximate cost not including having to pay additional FICA taxes on that amount. For simplicity sake let us assume that brings us up to 35000 additional cost. Assuming a standard 2:1 mark up on hard goods like comic books, the 80k figure makes sense. 40k cost of product + 35k additional labor costs.The ultimate question is whether ventures like his are worth doing if you have to pay someone a livable wage to do the work. If you can hire someone at a lower wage but allowing the government to subsidize their healthcare, food stamps, etc so they can live a first world standard of living, are you really any less of an asshole?Guy runs 2 stores selling comic books to grown ups in pricey san francisco and 17.5k a year per store is going to bankrupt him? He’s running on thin ice anyway if that is the case. You can barely rent a shithole apartment for that much in SF.One other question I had was the legitimacy of the gripe about comic books having their prices listed on the cover. Maybe it is a CA/SF regulation, but around here gas stations sell $.99 cans of arizona tea for $1.19 all the time.Can he really not do the same thing? Would it be too much of a logistical burden to do so, or would it be illegal where he operates?

            he goes into the math in detail herehttp://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-retailer-brian-hibbs-on-the-minimum-wage-and-surviving-in-san-francisco/
“The difference between today’s MW and 2018 is $3.95 /hour.  $3.95 times 190 hours times fifty-two weeks a year equals just over $39,000 then we have to add about another $3,000 for the matching taxes that all employers pay for Social Security and Medicare, so that’s $42,000 more that staff will cost. (not counting the new-this-year California mandated minimum Sick Days, either!)”
I suggest reading this interview, he really gets into detail about how fucked up the bay area pricing structures are.

                That bay area pricing structures are FU is a starting point. Learning why they are FU would lead to corrective actions. Government morons tinkering with the market anyone?

            The answer for him is to turn it around and charge a livable wage fee on each transaction. Make it a big noticeable thing so the customers can feel like they are doing Gaia’s work by shopping at his store. The whole point of raising the minimum wage is to appease the gods anyway. There’s no economic argument in favor of it. He needs to out pious the smug assholes in his city. He could also put a donation jar for his poor wage starved help.

                Doing on the local level is inviting to shoot yourself in the foot. In the interview he states that half an hour away there is an area where the minimum wage is $9.00 an hour. For a niche store like his, that could make a better opportunity for him. For stores which thrive on convenience and location, like fast food places or gas stations, it would not.
Enacting minimum wage on a state or federal level would have different outcomes than local in respect how minimum wages affect more local competition.

                    In other places where this has been tried, the small businesses fold or move so that’s the most likely outcome. My point was only that if would like to stay in the hipster area, he needs to monetize the piety. Of course, progressives are the least generous people according to studies on charitable giving so my idea is not likley to succeed.
Speaking of comic books,here’s a great story about that very strange business.

        Without paraphrasing Dickens’ Wilkins Micawber here, the age old truism that spending more than you earn has for reasons unknown completely escaped leftists for well over 150 years. The result, in Micawber’s words of not following the common sense approach, is indeed unhappiness.The man who, being good lefty, thinks that ideas are unaffected by reality can be  suddenly struck by the realisation that the generosity of others to apportion his income to the benefit of his fellow man in actual fact is more than just a nice thought: it all adds up. Two and two may well make five in the world of the unthinking commie (and comics) sympathiser but the fact that he doesn’t have enough ones let alone enough twos comes as a real shock.But I suspect that in conversations with his fellow leftys, it will be capitalism’s fault he has to find a whole lot more cash. So that’s alright then.

        There are millions or tens of millions of people, right now, who started at minimum wage or less, and through taking the trouble to show up every day without fail and picking up the experience that only work provides,  moved their way up to fifteen dollars an hour over time. What becomes of them? Does not woolly progressive fairness now require that they be paid at least $8hr more than they are worth?I work in a small company with three well paid individuals, and six who were started at four dollars over minimum wage and never raised. They are expected to move on and up when the opportunity arises. If a wage law like this were in place those six positions never would have existed. That is what has happened in France over fifty years. The average small business employed fifty, now the average is three.

        I hate comic books with passion, especially Marvel and DC. They’re the crudest form of establishment propaganda and they’re directed to man-childs.
