        But…but…diversity!Community “dialogue”!(reinterpreted) Affirmative Action!Special “Cultural” considerations!The rights of the mentally retarded to “access” of public school assets!Too bad no one determined that by (allegedly) “draping” it around their shoulders, they were dissing that flag.

        Catholic schools are not now (and likely have not been for some time) run by serious people forming institutional cultures distinct from secular schools.  (See recent controversies in Charlotte and Providence for gross examples).–I am not precisely sure why the activities of Bp. Hudal or Msgr. Tiso and the Slovak Church or corrupted Franciscans in Croatia 70 years ago are relevant to anything under discussion.  Pace what you read inCommentary, that sort of thing was sorely atypical even at the time.Fr. Coughlin was an exponent of monetary nostrums to which was appended a mess of anti-semitic posturing.  He was a vulgar man who was indulged by his bishop in a public ministry which had little to do with the authentic vocation of the priest.  A fascist he was not.
