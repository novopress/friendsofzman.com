        If you want Mars-based entertainment, compare the boring, preachy “Martian” with “The Red Planet”, a recent SciFi adventure movie worth seeing.  Despite the presence of Val Kilmer in the lead, it works.  Also, just incidentally, proves the chick who played Trinity in “The Matrix” is not hot.  Just Trinity.

        “Justified” was my favorite teevee drama of the last ten years. Great acting, writing and characters, endless plot twists and surprises, a refreshing lack of politically correct cultural propaganda and truly memorable villains.
Mary Steenburgen and Sam Neill show up in the last season doing what they do best.
Keep binging on that show. You will not be disappointed.

            Agreed. Each season of Justified got better and better. Season two was outstanding.My other favorite show that didn’t last long was FireFly.

        I’m in complete agreement with your view that real women have no desire to be lycra encased superheros.  The problem is that the attitude that girls are just as strong as boys and can behave in any way they please with no consequences that has been drilled into females for the last forty years or so has brought about a generation of females who have no fear of ANY kind of man or situation they’re in.  They can’t believe that, for instance, if you go out some fine evening and get yourself sloppy, passing out drunk there’s a good possibility that they’ll wake up the following morning having been used and abused.  But it’s never their fault and if you bring up the fact that if they had stayed sober this situation would probably not have happened you will be accused of being a sexist.Oh…and television has so much garbage we got rid of Dish and cable ages ago and only do a little binge watching occasionally but am going to try Justified.

        Good writing? Good dialogue? Good character development?
The Wire. In win, place, and show positions simultaneously.
If you’ve never seen this you will binge until the end and then go back to the beginning and watch it again.
Free if you have Amazon Prime.

            The greatest thing that ever happened to TV, in my opinion. Rivaled only by seasons 3-8 of The Simpsons.

        Just to throw in my two cents, DOWNTON ABBEY was all about the writing, acting, costumes, historical references and the numerous subplots all swirling about; the characters all developed over the seasons as economic, political and social events unfolded.No CGI, realistic (for the time period of the show) portrayal of gay individuals, and character commentary about the political winds of the time.Yes, the program may have presented a too rosy portrayal of the lives of the English “service” class, but it certainly arouses one to learn more about the social strata of that period.A GREAT TV series, IMHO.Frankly, I lost interest in watching TV some years back, but every once in a while a series will catch my attention as did  Downton Abbey.When I was a kid, I used to watch the Looney Tunes / Warner Bros. cartoons;  they were witty and funny and Pepe LePeu (the Francophile skunk) actually uttered real French words.Check out today’s cartoons. Better yet, don’t bother!

            Big problem with it is that they deliberately left out Christianity. You can’t portray those times truthfully without it.

        The thing about Justified is that a lot of us have to deal with people like that. I’ve seen quite enough of tweakers. I never knew what that was four years ago. And we know folks that deal in the illegal. The elites don’t. I liked the way you could root for Boyd Crowder or Ava, even if you didn’t like their lifestyle.You’d like Longmire too, but it’s on Netflix these days. They went off the rails a bit in season three, but the first season is great.(My husband is binge watching NYPD Blue, which I’ve never seen. It is well written and acted.)

        I would agree that so many of the movies these days are all CGI and little substance. The scripts are so much “been there, done that” that there are few real innovations, especially science fiction. We have a number of US TV shows in Germany (all with German voice-overs) so it’s always interesting to catch them in the US so we can actually hear what the actors voices really sound like. If you like history, the series “Rome” (on HBO and quite old now), was actually pretty good and “Vikings” seems to pretty accurate also. The short detective series Jesse Stone (with Tom Selleck) wasn’t bad. We really enjoyed the first series of True Detectives with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson – a bit gritty and twisted and the title music was also quite good.

        I love stories that take place in the south. Justified is true to the south, without being mean. Midnight in the garden of good and evil is another . Probably the best role of Kevin Spacey’s life.A love song for Bobby long  , gives you a look at a different John travolta. It’s tiring here in the south to be portrayed as mouth breathing knuckle dragging apes.

        I watch a bit more TV than you (I do watch the Sox too), but agree on the attraction of binge watching. I was very entertained by the entire run of Justified. Describing the characters as normal is pretty spot on. Normal but certainly not boring. You should watch the other seasons (assuming you can find time).

                Rounders is a very good film. Diamond Men is a similar sort of film. It has famous people, but no one saw it, despite it being well made. I’m not sure how that happens. The economics of Hollywood are convoluted.

                    Don’t let that lyin’ liar Anon mislead you, Z. Devil was a superior movie to Rounders in every way. It came out the same year as LA Confidential, a similar and good movie (although inferior to Devil), but it too flopped with with ten times the budget and A list stars.

                        The peculiar thing is that after suggesting Rounders, “LA Confidential” popped into my head and I wondered why. Go figure. Anyway, I never heard of your devil movie but another unseen and unsung terrific film is Nicholas Cage’s “Vampire’s Kiss”, which was superior to to “Devil” in every way, I think.

                    It’s so well-made, the plot flows so smoothly, it’s fun, it’s exciting, the acting is just right and Edward Norton is brilliant there, and somehow no one saw it. I suppose because there’s nothing bombastic about it. No big explosions. No grand concept. No helicopters. No threats on a President’s life and no weepy scenes that have people thinking “Academy Award”. Also: no big message about racism or the evils of gambling.

                I thought Rounders was pretty good.   Another that comes to mind is Confidence. Dustin Hoffman and Rachel Weisz playing against type plus Paul Giamatti and Luis Guzman.  Boiler Room is another good one except for the Ben Afleck scene. Gawd, that guy could spoil the kindergarten Christmas play.

        Back in the 80’s I reviewed movies for a big, well-known newspaper. So many of the movies at the time had the flavor you mention, that I came up with the phrase ‘ these aren’t real movies – they are just movie posters.’ And that’s what the “Martian” movie is too. The book, on the other hand, is a rocking science fiction story. – the writing is excellent, and the science is thorough. The hero is admirable, a survivor with a great funnybone. The other characters also rose above cardboard cutout status. I loved it so much I watched the movie – and instead of telling the story, they just strung together a bunch of posters. I believe the scriptwriters simply aren’t allowed to do their best, because the producers want to pour their money into the visuals. They think that’s what puts butts in seats. They may be right. But it loses almost all the story, doesn’t it?

                Drake, I agree about GOT. From the get go it touches repeatedly on every leftoid shibboleth in the book with all inclusive perverted sex appeal to the basest instinct.  I’ve read the books and seen the series through last year and can say emphatically ‘no redeeming social value.’ Took me awhile but I don’t think, should Martin ever publish another volume, I’d be interested.  And I doubt I’ll see the current season film version.

        “The Expanse” series on Syfy.  Very good space opera books and they did a decent job of turning it into a series without the blank-check CGI approach of a big movie.http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse

            Also “The Last Kingdom” on BBC – based on Bernard Cornwell’s books.  Any actual Englishmen left had to feel something at the literal birth England when the last Saxon lords showed up to fight for King Alfred.
Of course, being the BBC, they had to stick some completely improbable badass women.  Wasn’t too obnoxious until literally the last scene of season one – when a nun started killing Danish Vikings like a ninja.  I laughed at that one.

        Z, i recommend the 2012, single season, “Vegas” TV series, synopsis:
“Set in 1960s Las Vegas, the series centers on Sheriff Ralph Lamb (Quaid) and his dealings with Chicago mobster Vincent Savino (Chiklis), who moved west to set up his own operation. The Lamb character is based on a real-life former rancher of the same name who served as Sheriff of Clark County from 1961 to 1979.”
Or watch the trailer here:Vegas – (TV series 2012) – Trailer
And because it’s only one season, they wrap it all up nicely at the end.

        I’ve been watching Last Man Standing, which stars Tim Allen as a father of three teenaged daughters. He works at a Cabela’s type place and his weird interest in guns and his daughters’ lives is clearly supposed to be funny to the audience. But it’s nice to have a show where the dad isn’t the butt of all the jobs for a change.

        Anyone have a theory for why there are no really funny movies these days? What strikes me as bizarre is that TV is funnier than ever over the last decade or so. It took awhile but losing the laugh-track was the best thing that ever happened to TV comedies.

        If you guys like Sci-fi I think you would really like “Black Mirror (TV series)” by the BBC. Not all effects at all. Based on twist in technology in the future and how it effects humans. It surprised me because I hadn’t heard about it. “The Wire” is a great series. Baltimore’s Violence Guy says it’s exactly like the show there. B.V.G. is an interesting fellow who works in a grocery store, writes (mostly about violence) and stick fights. He’s one these guys whose so hard headed he refuses to be run out by the DinDu’s and would rather fight them.http://www.jameslafond.com/

        I liked Justified, but to be honest I thought after Elmore Leonard’s death it ran out of steam somewhat. As for The Martian, you will have noted how it is a feisty stop-at-nothing woman who rescues Matt (should it have been called the Mattian?) so qualifies for the ‘modern great movie’ tag.But I agree that people want to watch characters in stories and how they cope: Game Of Thrones is at its best when it is people having to cope with considerably less (wealth/property/status/love) than they were used to originally. It is a kind of survival epic.The old movies had to rely on character, and to a large degree the audience’s imagination when it came to ‘the big event.’ One day I expects e will go back to that kind of story, but for now… Remember kids, everything when shot with a bullet explodes in a huge ball of flame because yes, even garden sheds have petroleum-loaded explosives in them,

            That last part is so true. Having shot a lot of things as a kid, hoping they would explode, I can testify that it pretty much never happens. Even propane tanks just release their gas when punctured with a bullet.

        Since this topic has turned into “my favorite series” you might also enjoy “Life” with Damian Lewis. He was also the star in “Band of Brothers”. Unfortunately “Life” only ran 2-seasons but was very well done. I also enjoyed “Home Land” even through the lead actress (Claire Danes) is a bit annoying at times. At the moment we are anticipating the next season of the US version of “House of Cards”.  Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are outstanding in their roles.

            Agree with you on the ‘Life’ series. Well done for a short run. At least you don’t get a binge hangover. Damian Lewis as Major Dick Winters in ‘Band of Brothers’ is his best role. If you watch anything-watch ‘Band of Brothers.’

        Zman, concerning the movie The Martian I think you nailed it when you compared it to Tom Hanks’ Castaway and how it is (though not a bad movie itself) an inferior rendering of the genre.In my humble opinion “Castaway” type movies have to perform solidly on two aspects in order to be good films and grab the audience interest:1)	They must provide an interesting way out of the predicament for the marooned protagonist. It doesn’t have to be believable, just amusing enough to suspend disbelief.2)	We must find ourselves a way to the relate the character. To feel (or imagine to feel) his pain, his hopes,his fears and despair, so in the end we also share the character’s joy at being rescued and having survived the ordeal. We must invest in the character. Root for him.The main weakness in The Martian is the second aspect described above. Not that it flunks it completely (as I said, it is not a bad movie itself) but I found some difficulty in relating to Matt Damon’s character. Tom Hanks’s in Castaway plays an everyday guy (as it is his wont). His job and colleagues at FedEx are not alien to us. We can relate to him as we know people like him. And when he is marooned we see his pain: he suffers, he bleeds, he is afraid, he misses the love of his life. He has to resort to psychological anchors to stay sane (i.e. the volleyball “Wilson”). He even considers suicide and when finally he is rescued (physically a shell of a man) we feel also the disappointments he encounters and traumas that he is still carries. We empathize because we are able to imagine ourselves in the same situation.Matt Damon’s character in opposition is somewhat a bit more difficult to relate to. It is not only that we don’t know many guys like him, but also something worse: you get the strange feeling (at least in my case) that the guy is not real. His emotional reactions, his fortitude, his bragging (“Mars will be awed by my botanic skills”) seem a bit artificial. You get the sense that he is a composite character, the idealized version in the minds of many fake nerds about what they aspire to be, using SCIENCE! and the indomitable human spirit free of superstition to conquer the elements. The ending also relates to that: Matt Damon becomes a living legend basking in scholarly and tenured glory in the days to come. You can envision all the awards, doctorates and honorific titles he will be showered with.As I said: it is not a bad movie. But I was enjoying it more due to curiosity and amusement (i.e. “what would he do now?” stuff) than investment in the character.

        Couple or three observations:The very best, better by far than The Martian or Gravity, plays on only one screen, the Space Center in Florida. It is IMAX-3D, shot entirely on the International Space Station. If you ever get down that way to Disney or the other attractions you’ll be doing yourself disservice if you don’t spend a day there.When McCloud was popular I worked in Manhattan and had a shearling coat and a working cowboy’s hat that I had brought from Arizona. I’d walk down the street and people would look and think I was a balmy cosplay type or something. Thing is I was toasty warm and dry, they were cold and wet.The very best films of all time, according to me, were simple and mostly black and white. Casablanca, The Hustler, The Pawnbroker,  High Noon. Groundhog Day and Shane were in color but that didn’t make much difference.

        Nobody has mentioned “Deadwood”. It’s the only boxed set of bluray I wil *never* get rid of.
What to see a great series where “men are still men” you must see it. HBO really outdid themselves with this one.
You can get it free with Amazon Prime, as well as Rome.

            Deadwood…!I can’t believe it took this long for someone to mention it, since it put Olyphant on the proverbial map. One of the best Ive ever seen and what a disgrace to leave it hanging….The boys from ZZ top were such fans they hung around the set for over 16 hours just to get in the “crowd scene” in the last episode…..
FWIW I couldn’t get thru either Gravity (made it maybe 20 minutes even in exquisite 3D) or the Martian ( 20-30 min.) both too pnderous for me….
….anybody remember Doc Savage books as a kid?

        One could say the same about Breaking Bad. And The Sopranos. Though in both these cases the protagonists are supposed to be ‘bad’, in one way or another, though sympathetic.Justified is all that unusual. The ‘new man’ occurs more in comedies than in thrillers, where, ultimately, the man has to be a man to be effective.By the way, in the final season of Justified, there’s a crack at hipsters.

        I watch all my movies while stuck on overseas flights.  The Martian was boring – did anyone think Mat Daaamooon wouldn’t make it off the island, I mean Mars?  I was also annoyed with the typical movie SJW – the commander was a woman, head of NASA Chinese (they’re stealing everything they can from there anyway) and so on.A nice surprise was “Heart of the Ocean”, which is a retelling of Moby Dick.  Simple action-adventure yarn at sea with just a tad of eye rolling at the very end (a snide remark reminding us that whalers are the “oil industry”).  I never even heard of it (the title is the same as the diamond in Titanic, so it sounds like a chick flick), but was well entertained for two hours.

            When Damon was finally ready to blast off from the red planet, I kept thinking, maybe it will just explode and that’s the shock ending and why the film was popular.

                Like most of what Hollywood does, The Martian was high-end kumbaya.P.S. Just finished watching The Night Manager mini-series and loved it.

        Like anything else, the herd mentality strikes again.  Everyone wants in on the gravy train and sets up shop to do what is in vogue, until the next big thing.  It is the true innovators that work on the fringes trying new things like the guys working on a new 360 degree cinematography technology.  But that currently seems to be a play thing for directors.The best thing I can recommend is the book Martian.  Great stuff especially if you have a technical bent. It will always make the best story format.  Film is “usually” a dismal second place because of the reasons you state about participant involvement.  Imagination contributes a lot and each person can fill in their own details where as a lot of CGI stuff leaves everyone with, well, the same same.I agree about Justified.  When I discovered it, I was hooked immediately.  Finding diamonds in the rough is rare and I looked forward to each new season of great story telling.One of my recommendations for you is “Blue Bloods” a show about a cop family in NYC featuring … Tom Selleck.  I know, I know, don’t barf (since you are from Beantown).  But it is a pretty good show with good writing, acting, cast and lots of potential for bing watchnig!  Enjoy.

        The Martian was decent, but I don’t think it qualifies as sci-fi. It’s a feel good multi-culti story that just happens to be set on Mars. Like a watered down Apollo 13 updated for The Current Year.

            I think a film like The Martian is (like all films worth watching) best suited to the cinema, where you can detach yourself from reality and feel as if you’re on Mars. I also think that as we get older, it becomes more difficult for us to watch a film in what is essentially a trance state.

        Just for fun sometime watch a few classic episodes of “Seinfeld” followed by (if you can stand it) acouple of episodes of “Friends”. It helps you understand the Millennials’ complete lack of driving force and character.

            I’m curious:  Do you blame such shows for the stunted development of these sorry people, or are you contrasting these shows with newer things?
I ask because I spent some time in a university theater and music department in the last several years, and none of them picked up on Seinfeld references; neither had they heard of Monty Python, the Honeymooners, or a zillion other things that musicians are just supposed to *know*.
