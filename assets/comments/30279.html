        I have worked in US medical schools for over 20 years.The accreditation process for such schools has been completely hijacked by measures of “student satisfaction.” That is not the same as education. Further, the students aren’t supposed to have to do anything on their own. Everything is to be pushed out to them: research opportunities, externships, library resources, gym programs, and so forth. When, and how often, these resources are pushed out to the students must then be documented, or it didn’t happen for accreditors.  There can be absolutely no reports of student mistreatment by the faculty, and there is a rubric to determine whether something is mistreatment. Any such reports are grounds for probationary accreditation. I have no idea what these graduates do when they are practicing medicine and a patient calls them a racial or ethnic slur – I guess they just crumple.They ask about gun ownership because they fear liability from discharging patients to a home where they have access to guns when they also have a history of agitation or psychiatric diagnoses.Yes, graduates rarely hang out their own shingles, so to speak. I have heard senior administrators say that they are preparing doctors now to be hospital employees, not independent practitioners.The best primary care doctors I had locally basically ended their practices to do something else more meaningful to them. Both had reached the limit with the system in which they’d been trained.

        It’s only going to get better.  For decades, American medical schools have admitted Black with lower grades and test scores than Asians and White.  Now there is serious condideration in academic medicine about graduating Blacks with grades that would be failing for Asian or White medical students.

        Can’t get this to post under dittmar’s post as a reply. Maybe this will work, not that it will be noticed.Perhaps you were speaking of the Veterinary School of the University of Pennsylvania? We took our 12 year old rescue border collie in to our local vet for teeth cleaning, during which they noticed a growth that was too hard to get a sample for testing. We wound up taking her to Penn Veterinary upon their recommendation, and they were wonderful (as is often the case with teaching hospitals for us humans), ultimately pulling a few teeth, and after testing the growth, resolving our concerns about it. Can’t speak highly enough about the quality of care she received at their hands; full consult with the surgeon, attended by students for their edification, and then overnight vigilance by the staff after her scheduled surgery.

            I read PD too. Learned a lot from him.Come on guys, 30 minutes intense aerobic exercise is not too much to ask. 7 exercises, 10ish reps to failure, 30 minutes, 3 times a week. If you then eat enough protein you will add muscle, look better, feel better. When i started out, i could only do 3,4 pullups, 12 pushups. Now, 4 months later, i can do 13 pulls ups, 31, 32 pushups. No excuses. Make your body happy.Also, eat less often. Do you eat breakfast because you’re hungry or out of habit? Try skipping breakfast, 2 well balanced meals a day instead.Sunshine and or vitamin D too.

        It’s all so disheartening …. but like everything else, corporatism, the grift, and the desire for position and power have corrupted it all.  I remember a different healthcare system that still worked, even into the 1980s.  I recall a visit to a palsied, old, translucent-skinned surgeon in 1980.  Had an odd mole on my arm and made the climb up the polished oak stairway of the magnificent “professional arts” building where he had his office.  His nurse was a stately, older “looker” dressed in a starched, white nurses outfit, complete with cap.  His shaky hands quickly handled the syringe and expertly filled the area under the mole with some version of xylocaine.  Then, with two rapid slices, he removed the mole and some tissue.  He held it up to the light, rolled it between his fingers, and said: “Nope, not cancer,” and threw it into the trash.  Imagine one doing that now.   I paid him a small amount for the visit, and left.I still have the scar.

            PrimiPilus: ‘He held it up to the light, rolled it between his fingers, and said: “Nope, not cancer,” and threw it into the trash.’The existential sea change in Amurrikkkun health care is not being driven by governments nor by corporations nor by market forces nor by technology, but rather by the emergence of NEW PERSONALITY TYPES within the White race.There is a titanic meta-darwinian war at play in Amurrikkkun health care, and as things stand right now, the Passive Aggressive Industrial Complex [informed by the Sanhedrin of the  Frankfurt School] is selecting &amp; molding impressionable White healthcare personalities into monstrous inhuman ghouls which are completely unrecognizable as [what once would have been considered to be] White Amurrikkkun personalities.Those of you who haven’t yet crossed paths with a 21st Century RN-Karen or MD-Karen have no idea what’s awaiting you in the psychological torture chambers of the moderin hospital.And all the XY-chromosomed “men” in the system will have personalititties with the masculinity of, say, 50% Jerry Seinfeld and 50% George Michael.Statistically speaking, there are no longer any classical masculine White Christian Amurrikkkun personalities remaining in the Amurrikkkun hospital system.Those of you who have been healthy enough to have stayed out of the hospitals have no earthly idea as to the surrealistic insanity you will experience when you stay for a while in the moderin 21st Century Amurrikkkun hospital.NO.EARTHLY.IDEA.

        Guess what? Corporations are taking over vet offices. My vet, a local guy, just sold out to a southern corporation that is buying up vet practices. In my rural and small town NY region, there is only one vet left who is the old fashioned sole practitioner. And,prices are going up. Also going up? Prices of pet medicines. They used to be cheap, in many cases, just rebranded smaller does of human stuff. Not any more.

        I’ve suspected most routine healthcare is a farce for a while now. I’m 42 and never get a checkup because I know they’ll ask 6 dozen stupid questions, look in my ears, ask if I smoke, and be horrified at my weight despite the fact that I’m stronger than I’ve ever been after having got serious about lifting.We are now beginning to realize that the whole cholesterol thing was a scam from the get go. The prostate exam is a is akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack, BMI is a ridiculous metric because they want us all skinny and weak and most of *their* drugs do nothing.I haven’t finished the whole podcast yet but I suspect Z doesn’t get into the birthing side of our healthcare system and what disaster it has turned out to be. My wife insisted on homebirths for our four babies and only the last one did we have in an actual hospital merely because he was very late and even then with the most minimal interventions possible. Most deliveries in hospitals result in cesarean-sections as if all of the sudden after a million years women are no longer able to give birth vaginally.After birth they insist on a million check ups for the baby despite there being no issues. I attended one of the appointments once and was startled to see the nurse take out a tape measure and measure baby’s length because being a machinist, who often works in ten thousandths of an inch, I couldn’t possibly determine the length of my baby on my own with a tape measure so we had “the professionals” do it.  Then they look at the ears and the eyes, try to convince you the baby is deaf and needs a vaccine for STDs. What was actually accomplished during these checkups is unclear to me other than trying to not have some child welfare agency called on you. Maybe they want to put the baby on statins since every single other adult in the US above the age of 35 apparently needs them. (all of the sudden, one day, everyone’s blood is too thick?) The whole things is a joke and needs to come apart. I just hope there’s a lot of private practice or underground medicine available by people who are not retarded to keep us going when we actually need medical assistance.

            If I only had more happy face upvotes to give in service of your comment about homebirths. So often when there’s an issue with the baby at the hospital, they caused it in the first place.

            My youngest is 7. Only been to doctor twice (and no vaccines whatsoever). When healthcare comes up in discussion and someone asks about her doctor, I say she does not have one. They then ask about refular checkups, etc. I ask why should I. Anyone who sees her can see she is fit as a fiddle and smart and mature.  They invariably follow with, “Well, dont you eant to make sure?” I always reply, “Who knows more about my child’s health. A stranger who interacts with her for four minutes, or a loving, intelligent father who deals with her everyday, all day?” I then generally follow with, “Yeah, let me take a healthy kid to the place where sick people go.”

            At least they’re getting rid of the BMI, which apparently is rayciss, fatphobic, and in general too istismphobe.  Sigh.  At least they’re getting rid of it.As for the rest of it, it only gets worse with time, always worse and always at an ever worsening rate of change in the always-worsening worseness.  The worst of all right now is the clot shot, which they’ve now officially deemed “safe and effective” at 6 months hold, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they fudge this to the downside, at any newborn age, no matter how young.  Also, a parent really needs to never allow an injection of anything, because no matter what they tell you it is, it could contain clot shot juice or one of many other flavors of poison.My condolences you have to put up with this.  I wish you the best in navigating this nightmare, a system that now truly is an absolute nightmare.

Yep, lift and build muscle, you won’t pass it.   In all my insurance evaluations, I never once passed BMI—always some level of obesity indicated.  Insurance agent/examiner always laughed and commiserated with me, then called the office with his “observations”.  I always got a waver and never declined for insurance.  That’s how much the insurance industry considered the validity of the BMI rating.

            Good points…
but BMI is actually a pretty useful measure for the vast majority of people.  Very few men (and almost no women) are naturally carrying the amount of muscle to push them out of the healthy category, and if youre a serious athlete (which very few are) presumably youre also knowledgeable enough about physiology to mentally correct “overweight” slightly down to healthy.
Most people that are out of healthy BMI really are unhealthy and dont need the cope of thinking its actually only because theyre totally swole from bicep curls and stairstepper a couple times a week.

                    Yep… Stipe Miocic fighting for UFC heavyweight title is 6-4 234, bmi 28 officially only “overweight”.  Probably heavily juiced like most of the rest of UFC even at that…
And yet everybody at planet fitness is BMI category “obese” definitely due to how jacked they are and not papa johns.

                “… but BMI is actually a pretty useful measure for the vast majority of people. ”
That’s not the point, the point is that for well built, athletic men it gives false positives.  Additionally, the BMI is *not* a diagnostic measurement.  It tells you nothing of pathology—nothing.  So a failed “score” means what?  Rating people as “unhealthy” solely on such an instrument is a misuse of it.

        The veterans affairs is different than the civilan hospitals, but the one thing they both have in common is their contempt for the patients.  The VA has a multi-billion dollar budget, yet the care received is terrible.  I have not any serious issues, but should I need serious care someday, I would be scared out of mind.  The people who work at the VA tend to personify every negative stereotype of the government worker.  I firmly believe the VA is just another bloated government agency whose primary goal is to pay more government workers.  If all of us veterans died tomorrow, the employees would breathe a sigh of relief because they could just get paid for sitting around and doing nothjng.

            I’ll say this at the risk of pissing a few people off, but the primary problem with the VA is being overloaded with patients. There are far too many veterans who did their four years in the rear (like most of us did, including me), then spend the rest of their lives using the VA for their primary healthcare.If you have a disability rating, or are one of those few people that just “need” VA healthcare, that’s one thing. But the rest of us need to do like everyone else and leave the VA alone. Your four years shouldn’t entitle you to a lifetime of free healthcare.There, I said it.

                You certainly may have a point. Perhaps instead of overloading the VA system with vets using it for primary care, and thereby diluting the specialized care for those with serious bodily wounds/prostheses and psychological scarring, if there could be veteran’s rates for their general health needs (absent those serious specifically service-related problems I ennumerated) offered by HMOs and insurerers, this might take some of the pressure off of the specialized therapies deployed by the VA.

        Another point: OTC potassium supplement will do more for controlling HBP than their drugs (but their drugs will not work so great unless thyroid is fixed first, at which point you won’t need their drugs). Same thing they give you in the ER — IV potassium.Statins can induce what amounts to MS: destruction of the cholesterol-based neural sheathing. In old age, high cholesterol is actually protective against neural degeneration…. and happens because when thyroid declines, cholesterol isn’t utilized as efficiently. Arterial plaque has more to do with bad teeth and gum disease.There’s a researcher where I used to live in SoCal who is in that community because of a colon cancer cluster involving a single family group, and he gave a nifty presentation. He said flat out that all evidence is that it’s genetic (and that “consuming fiber” is looking to be counterproductive — uh, yeah, fiber is an irritant). From the information he presented, colon cancer appears to inherit as an incomplete dominant (probably a single gene). So if neither parent and no grandparent had it, chances that you will are just about zero.

            Great comment! The only thing you left out is magnesium. Magnesium is an integral part of the sodium ion pump system “muscle contraction and relaxation.”Sodium and calcium are flex muscle, potassium and magnesium are relax muscle. That includes arterial tension and relaxation.If western dr.’s had a clue high BP and a multitude of neuromuscular diseases could be eradicated or treated with simple magnesium supplements. Americans are immensely depleted in magnesium due to industrial farming and lack of crop rotation. Americans consume massive amounts of caffeine and caffeine causes depletion of all electrolytes. But we get about sodium because… well you know. Sodium is not the great evil, it is not in balance with potassium and magnesium.This is why gatoraid and its clones are a huge success.Extreme exercise causes sweating, causes loss of electrolytes. Americans are already heavily lacking in all but sodium and calcium.If you have severe muscle cramps as I do pickle juice is a godsend. It is not a gimmick it works in minutes. Pickle juice is loaded with sodium, potassium, and to a lesser degree magnesium.

                “Excess” sodium (usually, but not always salt) in the diet is another mountain made out of a mole hill. Yes, high sodium in the diet will raise one’s blood pressure…a few points. In the very frail it’s more of a factor, but still seems relatively tame. As with many critical substances in the body, there’s an optimal range. Too high or too low and problems ranging from the mild to lethal. It gets a bit more complex, but a person is liable to run into serious health risks (or even death) with sodium too low. The truth about sodium is just one of many examples you can find out for free browsing PubMed or other open access database and reading a handful of studies.

            My father died of colon cancer, I survived.  Yep, can’t beat genes.  But I will argue *for* a colonoscopy as this test caught and cured it, since you can cut it out on the spot if timing is right.  It was.  This event also educated me on the current state of our “health care” system, hence my many comments today.I received treatment and concern because of connections that I’d wager none of the people commenting here can imagine, much less will ever experience—and that ain’t right.  Never got a bill, never had to queue in line, was even guided through the process by my own assigned concierge—you know, like those folk who work in high priced hotels and send cocaine and hookers to your room.  He was at my side in admission and paperwork, walked me through testing, obtained same day lab results, set up physician meetings, and even brought me to the cafeteria for a lunch break.  All this done in a *single* visit.Carlin’s famous line comes to mind, “It’s a big club and you ain’t in it.”

        You haven’t been somewhere that VCA or Banfield have taken over the veterinary industry, which instantly couples it with “pet insurance” (same ownership) and bean counters.At the time I had backroom privs at my vet and watched the changeover in realtime. Now all the beans that used to be bundled into overhead are individually counted, and as a direct result prices are now 10x what they were before. Meanwhile the massive influx of new income funds an army of techs and paperpushers, and now there are places where it’s impossible to actually see the vet; at most you may see the technician, with an appointment a month in advance.===High blood pressure and elevated cholesterol are nearly always secondary to declining thyroid function (which usually begins in your 50s). Fix thyroid, and the HBP and “high” cholesterol go away, along with a raft of other “problems of aging” (including heart disease). Obesity is not a cause, it’s a secondary symptom to this same complex. Low thyroid makes you hungry. so you overeat. Soy and flaxseed content makes you hypothyroid (even if you weren’t before), and there is evidence that aspartame destroys the thyroid gland (so is counterproductive).Incidentally, the black population is genetically more inclined to be hypothyroid, therefore have a higher incidence of the above. (You can pretty much chart this vs a demographic’s life expectancy.) The longer you’re nursed along through the various symptoms, the more hypothyroid you get, and the more symptoms need treatment….

            Haven’t had mine checked yet, but based on success with Atkins I’m not complaining yet. Atkins (the books) do mention hypo thyroid as a potential problem barrier to weight loss. Too, he says that it’s not always diagnosed correctly. So if you think you have it, you may need to press for additional tests. I’m not claiming you are wrong about flaxseed or aspartame, but those are new cautions to me. Aspartame is already suspected of all sorts of issues, even Atkins recommended against it in early 2000s. Even the WHO recently trashed it. Of course, the WHO has taken something of a hit to its credibility especially in recent years. I’d translate their caution as “Hey! We need more money!” 🙂

        Spot on Z! In the late 90’s I fired my quack doctor “the type whose prescription for all that ailes you is to hand out anti represents.” I went up to the ghestapo window and asked for my file so I could take it with me to another dr. The feminazi told me I couldn’t have my file and it would be sent to my new dr. I was done with the healthcare system right there.This was also around the time they started collecting “data” for the government with questionnaires you had to fill out before they would see you. I looked at it and was like wtf? This has nothing to do with why I’m here to see a dr. The healthcare system is nothing but a hassle and an invasion of your privacy. They treat you like they own your ass!I got into it with a doctor over an RX and he gave me some crap and I told him… “I’m the paying customer, you work for me, not the other way around.” Blew his mind. They are not used to dealing with ppl who will take them on, and not just nod and approve with everything they say.When the Covid crap hit. I kept telling ppl “it’s a scam” got into a lot of arguments with friends and family who gave me crap for refusing the clot shot… in the end I was vindicated.I won’t end up in a dr’s office or hospital unless I’m unconscious and someone calls an ambulance.I do not trust any of these bastards!When I was kid our family doctor was beloved. He had taken care of three generations of my family, the entire extended family. I had pneumonia when I was 5 years old, he made house calls to see me rather than put me in the hospital. He was  the care in “healthcare.” Now all they care about is $$$.

            Wonderful yes we had an old family doc that knew us through 3 generations also so he knew what conditions we were likely to develop. He was the best of the old time docs and he basically did everything out of a 3 room former house with just one nurse and an office girl and an Xray machine. Prices for services were posted right at the desk and there was none of that hmo/gatekeeper quackery. Imagine if we eliminated the entire middleman healthcare worker jobs how much money we could save. Make me want to go right out and cancel my medigap coverage plan-I could save $4K per year. For millenia people have gotten along with just basic healthcare provided by midwives and simple remedies, anything more than that and it was the culling of the herd.

        Re:  Irrelevant questions on healthcare forms (waiting room activities).I had a relative who somehow found out he was put on some kind of list by the state, and he couldn’t figure out how to get off the list or how he was put on it.  I discussed the matter with a friend who had had the same doc for decades and knew him well.  He asked “why all the personal questions that had nothing to do with his visit?”  Apparently, the state (deep south red state), collects this info from health providers for the purpose of vetting gun purchases.  All the questions about “have you been depressed?” and “do you own any guns?” have nothing to do with your office visit.  Same for the questions related to the drugs you take.  Maybe everyone here already knew this, but it came as a shock to me.  The notion that the doctor may actually look at those forms or use them to help you is ridiculous.  I myself never go to the doctor, but people shouldn’t answer those questions.  Zman is correct – it’s not their business.  Of course, HIPAA is simply laughable.

                Yes, indeed.  The point, though, was that it was supposed to be a health questionnaire only.  Is it generally known, or can anyone here confirm or deny, that the data is provided to the state for the purpose of vetting potential gun purchasers?  My friend’s doc said that these questions were for that purpose.

                No, don’t always answer “no” or worse, decline.  Read and understand the question, then lie.  A decline to answer is simply considered in the worse possible light, and you will be flagged.  A “no” answer likewise could be the wrong answer and you will be flagged.
This is the same as answering “no” to the myriad of questions on your 4473 gun purchase form.  There is one question that requires a “Yes” response in the middle.  Smart shop owners always point that out so you don’t get slap happy with answering “no”.

            My eye doctor’s office was forced by regulation to change its charting software a few years ago. Getting ready for my first exam after the change, she got confused when the forms started demanding she ask me all kinds of weird lifestyle questions she’d never had to ask anyone. I sensed a pattern and she liked me so she let me come sit and look at it with her. Eventually I spotted that when I’d broken my foot about ten years earlier I’d been given an open-ended prescription for some kind of quasi-morphine. I’d never filled it once because things like that make me too nauseated. We fixed my doxx, she thought, but the options it offered her weren’t quite right, so I’m proabably a decade-plus untreated opiate addict, officially. I think this state was laying the groundwork for a “red flag” law it still doesn’t have but soon will. Pill users, boozers, vaxx refusers—arm up soon.

        Not too long ago my wife, a cancer patient, was bleeding into herself through a wound introduced by our hospital.  We were at the emergency service when the female black doctor with those long, highly-detailed faux fingernails was nervously tapping them against her teeth and bulbous lips during diagnosis phase.  This jogger then went to touch the affected area with the contaminated nails and fingerd.  I batted her hand away violently and uttered what I would do to her — death — if she persisted.  I demanded a new trauma  doctor and was granted a good one without being arrested.  We were lucky.  This was N’western in Chicago, and eventually we migrated my sweetheart’s care to Sloan Kettering, which we love.  My point is that even the most crucial care in the US is contaminated with garbage, even at top institutions.  We live in a medical minefield today.

        Back in the 1990’s when I was working in the SF Bay area tech industry, I was appalled by the high cost of the HMO system and the limitations of care it provided.Had I read this blog back then, I would have ranted on about how terrible the US medical system is compared to what we have here in Germany. How every German is insured and covered and we can practically walk into a local doctors and be seen without an appointment. Back in the day, Germany really was a model for how well socialized medicine works here in Europe.When I say “socialized”, I mean that in the same way we fund public schools, libraries, museums, roads, swimming pools, parks, etc. Everyone pays their fair share and everyone benefits equally.Public health care in Germany (medical and dental are combined) is compulsory by law at cost of 15% of your salary which is matched equally by your employer. There is a price cap where the most you can be charged is 800 Euro per month regardless of how much you earn (up to 58,000 Euros) meaning if you earn more than 58K per year, your health care premium will not exceed 800 Euros per month.One of the main benefits of the public health is that no one can lose it. For example, a couple will each pay 15% of their salary. If either loses their job, they are automatically covered under the other persons policy. If a single person looses their job, their unemployment picks up the cost of their health care. So no one can ever lose their health care. Period.Now if you want to pay for private health care, you can. Although much cheaper to start with, it becomes more expensive over the long term as rates increase with age and health status. But it doesn’t necessarily guarantee a higher level of health care. You might not have to share a room with three or four other patients and the food might be a bit better. But level of health care is the exactly same whether it’s private or public.The kicker between public and private is public looks more expensive at the start, but over time, private becomes much more expensive. Also, if you leave the public system and go into the private system, the public system is not obligated to take you back should you decide to switch over in say, 20-30 years, and contractually, you’re on the hook with the private system.Thankfully there are several provisions in our health care systems that still work starting with German law which limits restricts public hospitals from pocketing any profit. They can make a profit, which is still restricted, but by law, it has to go directly back in to the facility and not the pockets of the directors.Doctors are paid well, but not ridiculous salaries as in the US. The average German physician typically earns around 8,960 euros per month. Salaries start at around 3,300 Euros and reach 15,000 Euros.Malpractice lawsuits are almost unheard of unless the physician does something obviously incompetent or intentionally harmful. I think most Germans are intelligent enough to recognize physicians are not God and bad things do happen even under the care of the most skilled surgeons. So suing physicians and hospitals is not a “thing” here.All of these help keep prices down. Not necessarily low, but no German has ever had gone without health coverage or had to sell their house to pay for a tripple by-pass surgery.Having said all that, we are on a downward slope as well with the corporate take over of many private hospitals resulting in reduced staff, lower wages for care givers (generally nurses and staff) significantly shorter hospital stays for patient recovery and reduced long term care such as physical therapy.Since private hospitals do tend to pay a bit more than the public sector, it draws doctors and nurses away from the public hospitals so you can see how that will work out long term. However since Germans work to live, rather than living to work, enticing younger physicians with slightly higher salaries in exchange for longer hours probably won’t be the incentive HMOs think it will.But like in the US, here in Germany we are dealing with more “non-Germans” and a higher number of retirees requiring more interaction with a limited health care system, long term this will not end well here either.For anyone who’s interested, this publication in English explains how it works over here.https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/Dateien/5_Publikationen/Gesundheit/Broschueren/200629_BMG_Das_deutsche_Gesundheitssystem_EN.pdfAnd this site too –https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK298834/

            One of the major problems is that the role of health care has changed.  BITD, it was primarily to deal with people getting sick.  But now, it has a goal of “managing your health.”  This seems reasonable, at least to a small degree.  Seeing your doctor once or twice a year to check for the early signs of big diseases easily treated early is not a bad idea. But, of course, they try to systematize this and you end up with Z-Man’s pointless visit to his PCP where he doesn’t even see his doctor and most of the appointment is paperwork.  The doctor could have just sent him a form and subscription for blood tests.We moved to this management system in the early 70s to cut down the then supposedly high costs of healthcare.  The quality of care fell and the price rose. This, of course, necessitated new interventions.  Who knows if this is even extending peoples’ lives and doing so in a way that allows for higher quality of life or if we are merely extending the sick years running up huge bills.

            During my Army enlistment, I spent two years in Germany (early 1980s). One of my closest friends, also a soldier, was a bit older (late 20s) and had served earlier in Germany. Unusual for a GI, he spoke passable German and had many German friends. He once made a very insightful comment about Germany’s health care system: that people became doctors so they could help people, not because they wanted to get rich.

                If the aspect of “getting rich” takes the form of either quality or efficiency, then I’m all for it.  What seems not spoken of enough here is such. An example, CAT scans and MRI’s.Here we have “private” centers that schedule and perform such work outside of the more common places like hospitals.  In many socialized medicine countries, these tests I’m told are often scheduled weeks or months in advance.  I’ve never had an appointment (and I’ve now had several) more than a few days or a week out and the examine is a few hundred dollars with analysis provided—at least so I was told.  My insurance picked up the bill.

        If you think things are bad with marijuana now, wait until marijuana is de-scheduled and becomes legal at the federal level!Right now, big corporations are staying away from Marijuana and THC because it’s illegal and the banks are federal and they could lose all their money and go to federal prison.Right now marijuana is like 90s internet.  Lots of small providers with good prices. It’s the wild wild West of marijuana. But when the DEA de-schedules Marijuana, all bets are off.  Wait until it’s sitting on the shelves in Walmart, Target and Walgreens next to the aspirin and cold medicine.Of course, there has to be some aspect of clownworld here. A good example is the new drug driving laws.  Cops are getting certified as “drug driving recognition experts,”  where their word is basically law.  If you get arrested for drug driving and you test positive for THC, you get a drug driving conviction. Of course, the metabolite for THC stays in your system for days for light users and up to a month for heavy users. You can be stone cold sober and get a drug driving conviction.

            When I wonder why pot legalization is pushed so hard, when it is such a clearly bad idea, one obvious motivation is the profit motive.
But I also detect an element of the Boomers spiting their conservative parents.  It’s like we have to have pot legalization now because their parents punished them for smoking a joint in the late 60s.  “Ha ha Dad!  I take my revenge against you now!”

                That may be part of it, but I think a big part of it is how many blacks got arrested for it. The news media was always running the poor black man in prison for marijuana possession thing and of course, it was always a lie.  They did a spotlight on one guy supposedly in state prison for a joint.  They ignored the 25 other convictions and the 12 hot urine parole violations.  With my personal favorite as a guy who was sent to prison for life for a hot urine with the judge saying “Good luck, Mr Brown” while sentencing him to life in prison. Of course, the press left out that “Tyrone Brown” was on parole for armed robbery that he confessed to committing and that staying off drugs was part of his parole conditions.Plus the whole “I smell marijuana, I’m searching your car” thing as well. Plus, now the whole “your money smells like Marijuana, we’re going to have to confiscate it”

        The cat cardiologist!  I had to take my cat to the cardioligist several years ago after her check-up showed her having an unusually rapid heartbeat.  They put her on some heart medicine and now she’s pushing 20 yrs!
In all seriousness though, it’s astonishing how the quality of human care and veterinary care differ.  I live in PA which has a cutting edge veterinary college.  Several years ago, my doggo blew out her knee.  A vet here completely reconstructed her knee for a couple of thousand bucks.  A similar surgery on myself would have run to tens of thousands.

            Thailand, I heard, had medical malls where you just walked in, everything from a checkup to heart surgery.  Pay cash, and biff, boom, bam.  In India an MRI cost 150 bucks. (What is that, like 500,000 rupees?)

                This is true. A friend of a friend is married to a Thai woman. He went to Thailand a few years ago for a heart procedure, no waiting list for 6 months, chose his doctor, without red tape, paid cash. Recovered from the procedure and doing fine. Is a sorry state of affairs when an upper middle class lawyer has to travel to what most would deem a third world country to get better medical care without a hassle.

            My dad died last year, my dog died this year (of cancer). I’d have to say that the dog got better treatment than my dad did.
The veterinarian was an old white guy. Kept the dog alive for a year-and-a-half before she came out of remission.

        I’m so old that my doc of nearly 3 decades retired and the HMO had to assign a new gatekeeper GP from the pool. The advantage of having a doc that knows you is that communication is easy. For example, when he asked if I taken the clot shot, I gave him the “look” and it was never discussed again.My new doc is a woman in her 30s with kids. So med school, now full-time employed, and raising a family to boot. She’s also a bike fanatic, so we get along quite well. My sense is that she is highly intelligent, with a serious work ethic, and down to Earth in terms of pushing healthy exercise/eating habits versus magic pills.Here is my dilemma. On top of all of the above, she is stunningly attractive in a girl-next-door kind of way. No makeup, just what God gave her. Why is that a problem you ask? I usually ride to my exams wearing tight bike shorts. And she is too polite to draw attention to my embarrassment.

            Gross.
Get cycling underwear with bike padding built in and wear normal athletic shorts or pants (tuck one pantleg in or strap down or wear joggers with tapered leg).  Youre not Lance Armstrong needing extra 10ths up the mountain.
Literally no one needs to see that at all and if anyone needs to see it even less than that somehow its a decent woman with a family.

        I think what you’re going to find is that high end medical clinics with all the latest equipment and English speaking doctors will pop up in towns like Tijuana, Mexicali, Ciudad Juarez, etc. etc. No, I’m not talking about the plastic surgery mills that kill their patients from time to time. Well-to-do people in places like the wealthier suburbs of San Diego will decide that they’d rather be tended to by doctors and nurses who are not the product of American medical schools, what with test scores being thrown out as admittance criteria and racial quotas ensuring that qualified white applicants are kept out.

            Already there.  Straight down the I-5 from San Diego, top-notch cancer care hospitals and clinics festooning Tijuana like a lively port for marooned Americans.  Once you get past the ghettos with little kids and chickens running around in the street, that is.
(Historical note: a visit to a “Tijuana dentist” was an abortion clinic for hapless Hollywood wannabes before Roe v. Wade.Gays were able to get laetril, the alternative treatment for HIV, under the first Fauci Pandemic.)

                A decade or so back when at the university, I had a chance to read in depth my new university insurer’s plan.  I usually don’t bother since there is zero choice in the matter—you get who they (State) contracts with, or nothing.
I stumble upon a procedure for switching your assigned doctor on account of *race*.  Yep, there was a procedure outlined to follow if you didn’t want an (AA. ;-)) minority doctor assigned to you.  Had to read it twice to make sure it was saying what I think it was saying.

        Wow, is this ever a timely subject.Like Z, I am in good health and only interact with the “health care system” for an annual physical.But my 82-year old dad got sick and died last year, and that was an eye-opener for all the wrong reasons. He was double-vaxxed but got COVID anyway. Due to other health Issues, I took him to the ER for his fever of 102.5. I was afraid he was going to die right there, the big, fat, lethargic black receptionists didn’t give a fuck and it was difficult to even understand their Ebonics. There were probably 30 people ahead of him with insignificant boo-boos finger-fucking cell phones.He finally got admitted and after a couple of hours a young white male nurse got his fever down. I was relieved, thinking this would be no big deal. Wrong. Then they quarantined him for ten days and we couldn’t see him. He didn’t have his hearing aid so they wrote him off as a dementia patient and basically didn’t feed him anything. At the end of the ten days he had recovered from COVID but he hadn’t eaten so they told us he had to go on a feeding tube in a nursing home or else we had to sign off that he was a terminal hospice patient. They assured us that once we did that he could eat steak every day if he wanted, for fuck’s sake. The doctor was a fat slob and he was pitching hospice like a used-car salesman.I tried to spoon-feed him for a few days but to no avail. I asked an obese lesbian nurse with a 1/2 inch buzz cut and a voice like a second-grader for a spoon for his applesauce.She offered me a fork. My wife wend down five floors to the cafeteria to get a spoon.With only a couple of exceptions the nurses were basically useless and stayed in the hallway all day finger-fucking cell phones and flirting with blacks.I’ve never seen a bigger clusterfuck in my life, and he was in a “private” hospital with good insurance.When it’s my time I think I’d rather just go out into the woods with a bottle of bourbon to die by myself.

                Other patients’ success at getting required prescriptions, timely visits, etc., has always seemed completely foreign and incomprehensible to me. The only time I ever received even minimally acceptable care was when my doctor was in love with me.Your comment clarified the situation: Everyday retail medical “access” is unnavigable to patients who aren’t accustomed to running scams.My rich friends who can send a text and get their choice of speed or psych meds or whatever in an hour have told me that the reason I can’t even reliably get my unabusable chronic-symptom-relief pills is because I’m “autistic.” What they mean is that I’m not at the top and know a guy, nor at the bottom and know to lie. I follow publicly expressed procedures like some nerd, and I’m treated accordingly.Civilization!

            I had the exact same experience with my mother.  It’s like a tripwire where once they get it in their head that the person is demented or senile then it’s fine to treat the person like garbage and they even assume that the patient’s family wants to bump them off.  Like to the Chinaman doctor it was a foreign concept that I might actually care about my mother.  In my mom’s case she  wasn’t senile but had gone blind and suffered from hallucinations caused by the blindness (apparently your brain starts making stuff up to compensate for the lack of stimuli), as well as needing a hearing aid.Same hard sell from the doctor for hospice, even when there was no clear terminal condition.  Hard push to sign a DNR order as well.  Had to fight the doctor to get him to release her from the hospital as well since they wanted to milk the insurance longer despite not doing anything to help her.  Once she was home the people they sent over ostensibly for physical therapy just used up the allotted visits with pointless social workers or visits where they didn’t do anything except take her blood pressure, as the home health service was just milking the insurance as well.When she finally passed it was just a few minutes after I’d gotten to her hospital room after having had to waste time finding parking and fighting with the cunts they had at the doors to admit people.  The entry closest to where I parked was too far from her room and we couldn’t go through the hospital because of the coof so I had to drag my elderly father around the perimeter of the complex to go in the other side and then argue with that receptionist about letting two people up.  By the time we got to her room she was already unconscious and going into respiratory failure so I was robbed even of the chance to say goodbye.I hate everyone who works in healthcare.

                    Thats a good point… pretty much every profession has its remnant who is suffering from dealing with the insanity and stupidity of the rest of the profession as much or more than the rest of us.
Know this is true of goverment education, university, lawyers, public health, doctors, etc.  Even toilets like HR usually have a few good apples trying their best to stay undiscovered and therefore unpunished.
Its good to realize that there are a lot of us out there, we just lack means to identify one another.

            My father was healthy as a horse working a full time physical job at 80 years old. He liked the job and dreaded retirement. He didn’t need to work and was highly in demand.   His doctor found a lump on his ear and sent him to a cancer doctor. About 16 months later he was dead. His quality of life for the last year was terrible. He had several operations, a round of radiation and 2 rounds of chemo.  I seriously doubt a single day was added to his life. I believe had he just ignored it, he would have lived the same or longer without all the side effects of radiation and chemo and operations.. It was supposedly a minor and easy to treat cancer that was caught early.From my point of view, it was all voodoo. It accomplished nothing, possibly harmed him and cost a fortune.  The best part of that 16 months was the time between the initial discovery and the first round of radiation. It was months of waiting for appointments and test results and the like. During that time, it was like nothing happened. He felt great. Then the treatment started and he began deteriorating.   Like it was the system’s way of wringing the last value out of him.

            “Hospice” can be a godsend under the right care and circumstances and at the right time. The latter being a big part of hospice; the acceptance and care decisions at end of life.
But it has also become like “Covid” vis a vis billing codes, reimbursables, and the ability to shift a lot of deaths at the hands of the system into hospice which reduces the institutions mortality stats.
Evil has permeated the whole system. Enter accordingly.

            Really, if you are over 60 you need to have an exit strategy in place NOW, otherwise the first minor stroke or heart issue will take that decision out of your hands and you will wake up in the hospital and be at the mercy of the healthcare system, they may even decide to appoint a court ordered medical guardian for you in which case they will asset strip you and keep you prisoner/sick for as long as possible. If possible and you have someone you can trust, give them your medical power of attorney, and make out a POLST (Physicians Order for Life Sustaining Treatment, also called a living will) to be registered with the state. This outlines what treatment to be withheld and under what conditions and gives the person with your medical power of attorney the right to decide when to pull the plug and is backed up by your POLST. So many people don’t want to discuss death or dying and so the relatives are left with those agonizing decisions that cause lifelong guilt. Otherwise it’s the empty syringe filled with air for you..

        the ironic thing is a person has far more control over their health than a doctor does (if that makes sense).   if you do a few simple things, like avoid toxic pseudo-foods, limit caloric intake, exercise daily for at least 45 minutes, etc you will have good health and not need doctors and their dysfunctional treatments.  but most people are unwilling to make any effort in this regard, and therefore they suffer the consequences.  there is a wealth of information online about improving your health, and avoiding harmful behavior, that is far more effective than anything your GP is going to tell or give you.

            Not sure how old you are Karl, but I’m old.  As I age, I’m a bit more sympathetic to others wrt health upkeep.  Z-man is spot on wrt our health care “system”, it’s corrupt and stinks and certainly people can go a long way to helping themselves in this regard, however it’s difficult and now I can appreciate such.Everyday, before I get out of bed, I look up at the ceiling and realize that this moment is the *best* I’ll feel all day.  Old age is pain.  The body ages and things break or get sore. Exercise exasperates this.  Thus, it is a mental effort to simply get up and move about as one did without thought 30 years ago—but to sit about and not move those joints and muscles is to die.  Worse, to die before your heart stops.What to do?  Physical faculties decline and they need more work than ever (as a younger person) to maintain.  Some people can do this, some just are not mentally strong enough.  It is a struggle and we are not all up to the challenge—and that’s just considering folk without current limiting disabilities from accident and disease.

                I have the opposite issue these days – I feel at my worst when I wake up.
Other than that, you are spot on. I picked up a book about training for aging athletes, and it can be boiled down to use it or lose it.
The mental part is true as well. Suddenly, in middle age it’s a real effort to get up and out.
Sleep quality has gone right down the tubes, though my current post-work habit of flopping on the couch and nodding off certainty helping.

I’ve done mostly physical labor all my life “skilled trades.” I thought “but I don’t sit on my ass in a cubicle I spend 8-10 hours a day exercising on the job, what’s up with this?” I’m basically working out on the job, and I work out off the job when I can.

                “Old age is pain.”
Oh man, truer words were never spoken. That has been the one thing that has amazed me the most about growing old, the sheer amount of effort I have to give to managing and dealing with pain. I guess spending a significant amount of my early adulthood skiing and whitewater rafting for a living has a price.
As far wiser people before me have said, “Growing old ain’t for pussies.”

                i am 66 and retired.  i practice what i preach, and feel very good, for which i am appreciative.   and i am sympathetic to those worse off than me 🙂are you doing yoga, or walking?  not sure what your particular circumstances are, but it sounds like you may have some serious limitations :(.   you might get your testosterone levels checked; if low augmentation will help a lot.probably the one thing i do that is most beneficial is fasting.   one day a week i go without food the entire day, which is really more like 36 total hours of fasting (than 24).  this is something you could do even with physical limitations; i recommend doing some reading on the subject.

            Do you have any thoughts on what to do with the people who are unable to follow your good advice?In general, I believe that people who can’t take care of themselves should have their lives taken over by the state.  For example, I favor putting homeless people or those who refuse to work to support themselves in camps.  If your life has reached this point, you can’t inflict yourself on society.  There should be paths for the people in the camps to work their way out and rejoin society, but I expect that most of them will be unable.But what to do with those who won’t follow your wise counsel?  Putting them in camps isn’t the answer.  Do we pay for their healthcare?

                I’ve always thought that a “two tier” system of health care is the answer.  A “lower” tier I’ll call basic, and a higher tier I’ll call “premium”.The basic tier is supplied and paid for by the government and all citizens are automatically enrolled.  The premium tier by those electing to pay for a supplement to that care. Since this is a voluntary supplemental plan, you are subject to a rating process to determine payment.  Of course, this requires competition and States must bend to allow such by the Fed’s.The basic tier does not provide all types of care for all types of folk.  In that, society must make hard choices as to what they will allow to be done on “their dime”.  And yes, I suppose this will quickly get into some forms of “death with dignity”— euthanasia.Sound like what we have today, but everything depends upon how we limit the basic care plan.  Basic care will be very much like universal care in other nations, most of whom limit through rationing and long delays in treatment.  Premium (extra) is for those who will pay for it.Sounds harsh.  But how much harsher is it to be in a universal plan and be subject to its limitations brought upon it by those who care little about their health or the vagaries of government finances?

                    I will no countenance any discussion of legalized euthanasia for anybody, ever. That is the road to hell.
If you think your obese nurses of color are obnoxious now, just imagine them getting to decide whether or not to kill you.

                        There you go again ID.Legalized euthanasia is not necessarily involuntary and it is in wide-spread practice today in the USA!  It’s called “hospice” and it is paid for 100% by the Fed’s.Here’s how it (not all cases, obviously) works. You have a disease that threatens your life if not treated (or even if treated).  For example—and this is one example of many I can cite from direct experience—you need dialysis to survive.  Your survival without dialysis is measured in days and is painful.  However, life saving as this procedure is, it is grueling, difficult, expensive, and fraught with recurring complications—especially in the elderly.  Many as they age simply say, “No Más”.  What to do?  Well, you simply stop dialysis.Hospice “care” comes to the “rescue” with palliative care, which means a room with a view—albeit you can be treated at home, and drugs to ease pain—which translates into knocking you out with opioids until your organs finally fail and your heart stops.  Viola!  Euthanasia, but none dare say the word.Don’t believe me, read any local Hospice provider’s T&amp;C agreement. You check in, but you never check out as the song goes.  You will not be given curative or live prolonging treatment.  You will not be fed if you can’t eat, you will not be resuscitated, etc.My concept is a bit quicker and more honest, yet still voluntary, but make no mistake about it, everyday in every place this form of euthanasia goes on *with* government funding.

                    A hospice beneficiary can disenroll from the benefit at anytime. If I’m right then calling 911 rather than the hospice agency in an emergency is enough to disenroll a beneficiary from the hospice benefit.

                On a prior blog post, I commented civilization tried to tame nature and in the process created lots of unintended problems (mostly incompetent and stupid people).
Many people don’t like nature, but it is surprisingly merciful. If you’re old or weak, you’re simply killed off rapidly. No years and decades of suffering, no clogging the system, no bankrupting future generations.
Nature keeps things clean, it is civilization and its healthcare systems that clog up society.

            Agree. See my  essay length posting on that general topic below. Although I seem have reached my early 60s without too much damage, my self-improvement came in gradual steps.In my mid-20s I drank a six pack or more of regular soda. I rented a room in a home with an “alternative health” library. I browsed these. The one piece of advice I took was to cut down on the sugar: I was drinking perhaps 800+ calories of pure sugar daily, well over 1/3 of needed calories even for a large male. Two pieceds if you count taking a multi-vitamin. It took another roughly ten and twenty years to lose the smoking and alcohol habits. And another 40 to take diet more seriously (cutting out most junk carbs + upping supplements.)In fairness to the GP, as you note, most patients are unwilling or otherwise incapable of taking steps to improve diet, exercise, etc. So the best Doc can do is manage the inevitable symptoms.A final problem with health care is that, as you note, is that a provider may not accurately advise a patient of his options, risks and benefits, etc. Often this is out of dogmatic smugness or plain ignorance. Oh, cannot forget greed: If patient gets healthy, he might not visit as often or use as many drugs. Tut tut, that would hurt the bottom line. Alas sometimes even if he means well, there are constraints on Doc to remain silent on certain issues, lest he lose his license or even his career. Exhibit A: How many doctors recommended against the Covid jab? Even now, nearly three years in with an ever mounting body count, how many pediatricians have the balls to counsel parents to NOT give the jab to children, noting (correctly) that children at at nearly zero risk of the disease, and that the “vaccine” doesn’t even protect against infection and requires a booster in a few months.

                it is a lot easier to prevent damage to your body (through healthy habits) than fix things once they go wrong.  doctors don’t deal in good health, they deal in sickness.

            Completely true. But genetics play a big role as well. You can lead the life of a totally irresponsible maniac (Jimmy Page, Keith Richards) and soldier into your 80s if your genes or good. On the other hand, you can be a health saint and drop dead in your early 50s like Jim Fixx if you draw the genetic black bean.

                    Page’s smack addition almost killed him in the late 70s. Now, at the age of ca. 80 he looks the helluva lot better than he did when he was 30. I would say that God is looking out for him, but that would be ludicrous. Another supernatural entity may be, though…

                Jim Fixx’s death had a big impact of my Dad.  He was an early adopter of fitness in the 70s.  He was the first guy to be seen jogging and the first to have a home weight gym.I remember he had Jim Fixx’s books, as well as books by Arnold before Arnold was a movie start.I remember my Dad saying that one of the most rewarding things about fitness was how much of it was under his control, unlike his work life, where so much was beyond his control.  Your progress was a function of your own effort and dedication.When Fixx died, it was an unfortunate reminder that even your health is not entirely under your control.

        Most excellent rant – because so so true.Last time I went to my doc he fired me because I don’t have insurance. Could not believe I was even in his office without insurance even though ready to pay cash. He was only my doc b/c he replaced my last one who quit after covid. I think most of the thinking ones split then.

                It also goes with “ok, well how much does that cost?” And then watching them look at you crooked and mumble and fuss and then ask “what is your insurance?”. “Cash.” And then “uh well I will have to go look that up mumble mumble”
The irony of calling the health insurance a “marketplace”. There are no prices, only billings and collectables.

                    If you want to pay cash, you need to find a privately owned clinic or concierge clinic. They love, Love, LOVE when patients pay cash and will almost always have a reduced price list, or flat discount, for everything if you pay at time of service. Don’t even bother with hospital-affiliated providers if cash is your thing. My hospital lab doesn’t even have a price list for the tests we run.

                    As one of those who’ve taken advantage of the full subsidy value of Obamacare since it started, allow me to defend the concept of marketplace. Your statement is probably true enough about and may be referring to the billing at the doctor’s level. However, the online health exchanges where we buy our policies really are marketplaces, in the sense that there are multiple options for how we can “spend” our subsidy. For example, my health needs are modest so I choose a plan mostly paid by the subsidy, this is the “silver” policy. If somebody wants more bells and whistles, he can pay a bit more out of pocket for a fancy plan.

        Excellent podcast on a topic that (unfortunately) I know far too much about, having worked in HC in various capacities for over 20 years, now as a lab tech. In that time I’ve learned two important things. First, while individual caregivers *may* care about you and your health, the overall system couldn’t care in the slightest. As you say, you are merely a source of revenue. Second, the modern healthcare system is a massive money-laundering operation. You learn this if you have to be admitted for any reason, because at no time in the process can you get an accurate figure on what you owe. Billing is shifted around through various departments and providers, through insurance companies, then back (eventually) to the patient. If any other private company ran their books this way, they’d be jumped on by all sorts of government agencies. In HC, it’s just a day that ends in Y.Is healthcare a lifestyle? Absolutely! How many other professions do you know of  where its practitioners are told every day that they are FRIGGIN’ HEROES?! Sadly, a large percentage of them actually believe it, especially nurses (now, don’t get me started on nurses…). Doctors are even worse. Well, some doctors. Like most professions, we rarely notice the ones who just do their jobs well. It’s the bad ones we really remember. From where I sit, Oncologists and Anesthesiologists are the worst, as far as having god-complexes.I completely agree with you on how the healthcare professions were primarily responsible for the covid hysteria. These people were out of control, and it was especially bad inside the business, where the ego-boost really made them feel more important than ever. To describe it as “cult-ish” is an understatement. These people went crazy.Also, you are completely correct that most of healthcare could be done by computers. Considering that almost ALL of healthcare decisions are based on algorithms, that point seems obvious. When you get to emergency medicine, the ‘decision tree’ algorithms become a religion. Very few providers have the ability to make independent decisions, nor are the empowered to. Also, from a CYA standpoint (which is the absolute driving force for all providers), deviation from the algorithm can mean increased liability, and that’s the one thing that they care about more than profits.Regarding you visit to get labs drawn… The redundancy seems to be more intense with vibrancy. Honestly, I would be very nervous having your experience if she wasn’t being required to repeatedly check your info. It is amazingly easy to switch labels on the samples. Then, you get a call from your doctor telling you you need to get biopsies, more testing, etc, when you are healthy, but your test label got switched with the 300-lb African man your ‘highly-qualified’ phlebotomist was chatting with right after your visit.As for vet samples, most labs aren’t validated to run veterinary samples. Mine used to be validated for hematology only, but that went away when we got new analyzers. Believe it or not, many different types of critter blood can really foul up an analyzer. There’s also a matter of keeping the testing calibrated and QC’d for all the different critter types, which can be a real cost and maintenance issue.My last point is regarding your comparison of human to veterinary healthcare. I got a real eye-opener when I was deployed to the Role 3 hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan. It was like the veterinary clinic you described except for humans. No HR department, no billing/referals, nothing that wasn’t directly meant for patient care. It was amazing. The doctors loved it. As a patient, everything happened quickly and efficiently, and no one came to you about co-pays or deductibles. It really was refreshing to see how medicine is supposed to be practiced.

        I will interject to appreciate some aspects of the health care system. My wife has had five c-sections, and the physiology of her body is such that if we were in the 1800’s I would have buried my wife after she died delivering our first child.For our most recent, my wife was in recovery for four days, and our child had to be in the NICU for 8 days. We haven’t gotten all the bills, but our insurance is looking at paying 150 grand for everything, our family about $1000. The nurses were also excellent and caring, our doctor professional and competent, and they surprisingly did not push back when we refused the Hep B vaccine.That being said, 150 grand for a routine surgery and for two people to stay in the hospital for a few days is ludicrous, and I would argue about 75% of it was administrative.As for the connection with the nurses, that’s something I noticed too.  Lucky most of the nurses were wholesome and a good influence, I’ve had doctor friends who always tell me how insane their nurses are. Mind you, this is considered the best hospital in the state, so that clearly helps, can’t imagine how poorly a hospital operates in poorer areas.

            I’ve had good experiences in hospitals too. Once you get past the waiting, the admin, and the data-mining, it’s not bad. I just stay away from the places that look like they’re full of underinsured people.The total cost of health care has always been a problem in this country. It’s just like the military with their $75 hammers. Everyone complains about it, including politicians and the media, yet things have not improved. Nobody – NOBODY – actually supports employer-sponsored health care. Even the boomer-cons who still shake their fists at “socialized medicine”. Yet it’s been a thing for 40 years and shows no signs of disappearing. There must be some deeper racket going on.

            “ That being said, 150 grand for a routine surgery and for two people to stay in the hospital for a few days is ludicrous, and I would argue about 75% of it was administrative.”But did the insurance pay $150K?  Doubtful.  This is nothing but a Kabuki “dance” in which one party over-bills and the other party underpays.Here’s an example taken from my Medicare.  I had blood work done.  They billed Medicare something like $1,115.  Medicare sent me an itemized statement as to these blood work charges and what they paid.  Long story short, Medicare paid about $115–total!  Also, at the end of the Medicare statement (as they all now say):  Your provider, as a Medicare approved provider, has agreed to accept this reimbursement as *full* payment for services provided.  Do not pay any subsequent/additional  billings.”So yeah, something is wrong here.  But I’m not sure it’s the high cost of medical services.  I no longer receive these itemized bills because my insurance turned into an “Advantage” Plan and now United Health handles both ends—Medicare and Gap Insurance and processing.BTW, I struggled mightily to *not* enroll in Medicare, only to be rejected for any and all major insurance plans.  They simply would no longer quote me when I turned 65 without Medicare.  Best I could do was to hire (concierge) family doctor myself and pay yearly fee.In this regard, you can’t win, you can’t break even, and you certainly can’t quite the game.

            We had a much worse experience with our hospital system having babies post Covid. This was late fall 2021 and they were still in full totalitarian mode.  There was a shift away from patient care that had been very good before then.  The costs are also outrageously high, in addition to what we pay for our insurance every month we shelled out another $6,000.  It really does seem to be a case of the quality of doctor you get.  It is understandable why a lot of the trad wife types are trying to do home births with a midwife after you spend some time in the hospital system.

                The birth of ours during lockdowns was a nightmare. Either totally lazy of psychopaths. Our best nurse was explaining how the hospital was trying to get her fired for refusing the vax. It made a 180 since then somehow.

            Yeah, but a I’ve come to believe it’s a bit more complicated as our foods and genetic makeup is often a mismatch.  Remember the 60’s?  I do.  Look at any of the army training films and the recruits.  Stick thin.  What happened?  We didn’t have folk over eat then?  Doubtful.We’ve had a societal sea change.  Exercise down—yes.  But processed food, and fast foods (eating out) way up as well.  So where are genes in this?  Must be.  I myself retired and then lost 3 pants sizes just by getting off my ass from a computer screen.  My diet is no better than a 14 yo’s—I admit however to eating decidedly less however.

            Partially true. But if you read about nutrition, especially slightly away from the mainstream, you’ll find the details are a little bit different. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, the body handles a calorie that comes from a carbohydrate or a fat rather differently. Atkins and similar keto diets may not be mainstream, but there is a lot of science that backs up their claims. And personal experience too…I lost 20+ Lb. in &lt; 3 months on Atkins. I&#x27;ve drastically cut my consumption of junk carbs, and my blood lipids show the improvement. It&#x27;s not picture perfect (my &quot;total cholesterol&quot; is still a bit over 200, but by non-conventional metrics this is not a problem, especially when TG and LDL have dropped substantially. Also HDL went up which even conventional dogma says is good. These, according to my diet books, are typical results when on a low carb diet.)Established medical system still has much catching up to do. I do not suffer from diabetes. But if what my books report is accurate, the prevailing dietary advice to such people is a traditional diet, very high in carbohydrates. You don&#x27;t need a PhD in biochemistry to know that most carbs are rapidly digested into glucose, which spikes blood sugar levels, which spikes insulin output, which exacerbates a whole list of known health issues. Now perhaps I&#x27;m just an ignorant layman, but it seems to me that if one&#x27;s body has trouble safely handling blood sugar, then about the stupidest thing one could do would be to feed it far more sugar than it needs. Yet, in so many words, this is typical treatment advice. Of course, drugs and insulin can help manage symptoms, but wouldn&#x27;t it be far better to treat the underlying causes?Although my knowledge of all this stuff is say grade-school level, I&#x27;ve been fascinated by my learning. For example, did you know that the so-called &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; (LDL) comes exclusively from VLDL (what&#x27;s called &quot;triglycerides&quot; on your test), and this lipoprotein is produced exclusively by the liver and mainly (perhaps entirely, I&#x27;m not clear on that point) by the liver&#x27;s synthesizing fats from glucose?The fats you eat, of any type, enter the blood stream in a giant lipoprotein called a chylomicron.How many well-meaning doctors tell their patient, that they need to cut saturated fats cause their triglyerides and LDL are too high,? This advice is totally off-base. What needs to be dialed back is the proportion of carbohydrates that, when in surplus, directly drive VLDL creation (fat storage).None of the above is to say one cannot get fat by eating a high fat diet. But apparently that&#x27;s no easy task UNLESS the person is also ingesting a large amount of carbohydrates too. It&#x27;s far more likely to happen when excessive carbs (and calories) are eaten.

        When the doctor asks me “how are you today” as part of exchanging basic pleasantries, he codes that exchange as a “depression screening” and gets a nice insurance payout. Medical billing, just like every other part of the system, is an enormous grift.

            Vittorio, not sure of your specific example, but the billing gaming practice seems alive and well.  One example personally observed: birth of our son.  Two weeks premature—if one can really say that, birth estimates have variation in accuracy.  Point is however, hospital tossed the mother and child out even with a weak liver function test.  The DRG for the birth paid one amount, regardless of such minor complications.We were instructed to do some “magical” home treatment for this jaundiced baby by setting him along the patio window, naked and exposing him to sunlight for UV rays.  I kept my mouth shut as wife was fretful, but I knew this was probably bullshit as typical windows prevent most UV’s.Hospital sent the standard home nurse for a visit two days later and she said, “you’ve got a child who is jaundiced, need to bring him back and admit him”.  Hell he was released like that!  So back we go, except this time he’s admitted as a “patient” in his own right.  Bingo, new DRG, new billing, own room, etc.  This time they bring out the large black lights, the little eye patches, and “treat” him. Two days later, cured and released.None of the above had to happen, except at that time insurance did not reimburse for such complications.

        As I like to tell people, you could ask 10 people what was wrong with the American healthcare system and you’d get 10 different answers and they would all be correct.Also, this is a hobby horse of super-normie Karl Denninger and I recall an interview with him (that he posted on his site) where he said that a big part of Obamacare was to rescue the high-risk insurance pools which were going to fail.  The interviewer asked that if the costs were backed back out and the pools subsequently failed what would then happen to those in the high risk pools and Denninger notably responded:“I don’t know”No there won’t be any of that, better that no one ever have any regular diagnostics ever again than there be one sob-story on the news about a baby born with an exotic heart condition who didn’t make it due to the “heartless healthcare system”.

            Yes. Obamacare was an elaborate cross-subsidy scheme.
“Insurance”, by definition, means underwriting for frequency and severity of the risk to be insured. Subsidy of fat bastards with poor health is not insurance. Of course, the politics of all these subsidies require the use of the term “insurance”.

                Your comment touches on a point that I sometimes make about a libertarian or “personal responsibility”-based society:  most people are unwilling to watch the unfit and unlucky die in the street, but that is what will happen if we commit to a “personal responsibility” society.As long as we remain an affluent society, I guess that even most of the people who agree with the “I’m not going to pay for the healthcare of smokers and fatties” would be unable to endure the consequences of their intellectual commitments.  Maybe I’m wrong, but I don’t think so.Will most white people in an affluent society be able to endure the consequences of a society that refuses to pay for the health care of smokers and fatties?  Perhaps we could, if women were not allowed to vote…

                    It might work after a fashion, and I maintain is working today—after a fashion.  Remember baseball hall of famer, Micky Mantle.  He blew out his liver through alcoholism and was denied a transplant due to his “condition” (he was unable to show an appropriate length of sobriety).Well, his PR team went public and got him back on the list and he got his new liver.  However, a complication it seems with such folk is liver cancer, which he got and died from within a few months, thereby proving the doctors correct in their removal of him from the transplant list.There is precedence for denial due to certain conditions.  We just need to expand those conditions.

                    Again, don’t deny the aspect of genetic proclivity.  Just outside the Phx area is an Indian reservation and a government clinic that treats these people.  They have the largest dialysis center in the world and the highest obesity rates known outside of US Samoa.Basically, these people lived and prospered before the white man took over and placed them on reservations and fed them.  Not going wobbly here, just pointing out a classic “experiment” right in our own back yard.Indeed, there was an academic who actually pointed out that everything wrong with these people was because of a mismatch between their inherent genetics and a western lifestyle.  He was cast into the void some time ago for noticing.  🙁

                        Genetics are huge–so to speak. But so is common sense–which may also be genetic, but that’s another rabbit warren. Smart people are likely to eat healthier and more sensibly than are idiots. And, as well all know, intelligence breaks along racial (genetic) fault lines.

        This is one area where “Gaze,” (a favorite term of the old New Left) actually applies, and Michel Foucault is actually worth reading. “The Birth of the Clinic” examines how the inherently imbalanced power dynamic between patient and doctor leads to some corrupt and finally sadistic dynamics. We always talk about there being a certain percentage of cops and prison guards who get into it not because it’s a steady job, but because it feeds something sadistic or authoritarian in their personality. We rarely think about it as regards doctors, but we obviously need to.That’s another reason they might spring Saran Saran Wrap Man free from that California prison sooner rather than later; another Kennedy needs be “removed from the ballot.” Snakeman Newsom runs that state, and is in-line to replace the Mummy in the White House, so why not issue a pardon to Bobby’s killer?

            I believe a lot of doctors who end up specializing in psychiatry suffer from some degree of mental illness and receive therapeutic value/feel better about themselves after seeing patients who are in even more mental anguish than themselves.  There may be a sadistic component too in getting to order these poor saps around and try to mold their thinking.

                It is an axiom of “mental health care” that most of the people who go into social work, psychology and psychiatry do so to figure out how to heal themselves. As for the sadistic element, my guess is that it is almost statistically insignificant. Such folk would be far more inclined to visit any sadistic impulses upon white people generically rather than their own patients.

                    Art imitates life? Sharon Stone plays the authoress in 1992’s fim “Basic Instinct.” Other than the famous glimpse of her nether regions, more relevant to the plot line is that she apparently acts out the killings she writes about in her novels. At one point in the movie, it’s revealed that she has a master degree in psychology.

            I have had a number of friends/acquaintances over the years who have become doctors/nurses/etc. Not a single one of them did it because of some feelings of wanting to help people. Every single one of them chose their professions because it paid well, the hours and lifestyle were acceptable to them, and it wasn’t especially difficult. I am the same. I chose the lab because of the pay, I didn’t have to deal with patients, and it isn’t very difficult (for a reasonably intelligent person). As I like to say, ‘there are much harder ways to make less money.’In other words, it’s just a job. Still, it’s a job with a HUGE public relations machine behind it, telling the world how wonderful we are for doing it. To be honest, if I could get paid the same to do something similar outside of healthcare, I’d do it in an instant. My dream job? Chemist/microbiologist in a waste water treatment plant. Similar pay, but much better environment to work it (ironic, isn’t it?). Unfortunately, their aren’t that many of those jobs around, and the people that have them aren’t giving them up.

        Gonna do a bit of an effort-post here, but before I get to that, a couple quick points: I think when you finally get away from Lagos (hopefully to a more rural area) you’ll find that in smaller, less vibrant towns that the system does actually work much better. As a rule, the farther away you get from diversity, the better the system works. Kinda true for life in general, eh?Second, for what you’re spending on premiums vs. your actual healthcare costs, you might want to consider a “concierge” medical plan. Basically, no insurance, cash only. It’s much, much cheaper and far more efficient. Also, the providers who run those plans seem much happier to be doing their jobs.

            Concierge is growing here.  I see it much like “charter schools” vs public.  It a consumer choice which threatens the monopoly.
Free, but poor, health care is just fooling yourself—and could be deadly as in waiting for 6 weeks to see a specialist only for him to tell you your stage 3 cancer is now stage 4.  In an era of post Covid vaccine super rapid cancers, this seems suboptimal.

                That’s a dire example to be sure. But routine care often has very long waiting times. I read a lot of UK press and their National Health Service is all but seized up. Months or years waiting times are common. Even here in the US, sometimes an appointment even with an existing office may be a month or two out. Problem: what about urgent needs? Well for the there’s the ER or urgent care. Another problem: as already noted, much of our low-value population gets their care at the ER, too. I realize they have some senses of priority, but just the same, if I’m suffering a heart attack or have arterial bleeding, I’d feel better served if not being twentieth in line behind people needing a sprain or a sore tooth looked at.

                    I agree.  I’ve been the recipient of some fantastic health care not afforded the hoi polloi (daughter works in the field).  I want everyone to have that advantage *if* possible, not just our “betters”.Since we, as a society, can’t afford such for everyone, then I’d at least like to be able to use my own resources to buy health care if I decide to.  It seems every attempt at a national health care system attempts to suppress free choice in some attempt to mask its inherent mediocrity.Remember Obama Care:  “You can keep your plan if you like it”, “You can keep your doctor if you like him”.  Of course, they never told you they would set minimal “standards” for private plans and doctor renumeration, which all but eliminated any choice except the government option.  Hell, in AZ the remaining two State insurance companies had to raise prices over 100%—highest increase in the nation.  A simply ploy to drive folk to the government alternative.

                        That’s of moderate interest, as I’ve been a subsidized (Obamacare) user since it began. Although I only know the rough outlines, yes the problem with the “Affordable Care Act” was that it forced changes that, while they broaded the availability of insurance, it drove up costs. Enough so, that at times, the State Exchanges (marketplaces) had trouble finding insurers willing to sell policies. How they work these bugs out, I don’t know.I can only speak from my state (FL) experiene: it’s my understanding that any resident can buy a policy on the Marketplace, although they were set up to faciitate buying ACA compliant policies and are the only place to use the subsidy.There were cases where corporations were trying to steer workers to the exchanges so they (the firm) could save on its own health policy costs. I don’t know if this is what your AZ example is about.

                        Ben, I only can relate to my situation.  I had complete coverage under State plan through the university.  When Obamacare came about, the plan cost rose.  Why?  It was the best of offerings for State employees (no small number) and had been for years.The reason, Obamacare folk decided the plan did not cover what it wanted.  Mostly social things that were on the Dem agenda.  They wrote a minimal plan specification accordingly—not to the needs of folk, but to the needs of their agenda.  Further they required *all* plans to include such.  Thereby masking the ruse.  Finally, I’ve repeatedly read that today, after a decade plus of Obamacare the number of uninsured is the same or greater than it was pre-Obamacare—the entire given rationale for its enactment.

        From what I have heard and read, the reason for the constant repetition of questions is for the benefit of the medical workers.  These dunces need that done to help prevent grabbing the wrong information and treating you for the wrong thing.   I think the number of deaths in the U.S. attributed to medical errors is likely exaggerated, but still significant.

I’m not so sure of that. I see doctors do amazingly stupid things every day. When you consider the extreme lengths that doctors and nurses (especially nurses) go through to avoid any and all responsibility for any mistakes they make, I’d say that number is probably low.

                “Peyronie’s Disease.” I remembered that from memory. Even the spelling. Fortunately I don’t suffer from it.  But still it’s exasperating that I can instantly recall such an irrelevant datum, yet cannot recall the name of the person I met five minutes ago. (Wish I were joking.) 😀

        Like everything we can look to Britain and Canada for a glimpse into the next phase of decay. Ultimately, it will probably be South African levels of bad.Our task is to continue with a demographic separation. We have to give ourselves some chance of getting treatment by our own folk. That may be impossible given the race based Tammany Hall that they will turn medical services into. But, we have to try. I also think we have to get rid of the ideas of freedom and voluntary interaction. They control the system. We need to accept reality and get control of the system, and run it by us and for us. They chose the rules of a zero-sum race based spoils system. We have to play for keeps for our benefit.I think Canada’s first signs of throwing in the towel is mass assisted suicide – MAiD (Medical Assistance in Dying I believe). They are starting with vets and elderly white people. In the meantime, a new medical center opened in New York where people can pay something like $300,000 for an annual membership. They will get aristocratic medical care.

She’s apparently too stupid to realize that the people getting rid of the whites will see her as white too. Then she’ll be all fellow white wanting our protection.

                    I did a bit of searching for how she fares in the eligibility test. She certainly scores high on the misanthropy part.
It is interesting to see Google searches. I found this Fact Check of whether or not Carol Baker said, “get rid of all white Americans.” It concluded that she did not say it, even though she clearly says it in the video.

            Honestly “healthcare” is evil. What we need is for Nature to come back and for the weak and old to die off.
As far as I’m concerned, there is no greater evil than letting the undeserving live beyond their time. Physicians (falsely labelled as “doctors”, a term only appropriate for scholars) are pure evil incarnate.
The best thing that can happen is that the “healthcare” system collapses completely and with that weaklings die off.

        My recent experience shows the stark changes in the American healthcare system over 30 years.Back in 1995, when I was 15, I broke my femur at the neck.  The way it broke damaged the blood supply to my hip joint, which caused necrosis.  This is the same exact issue Bo Jackson had when he dislocated his hip/femur and ended his football career, necessitating a hip replacement.  As a teenager I was too young for a hip replacement, so they decided to do a flexion osteotomy, where they re-break the femur, rotate the head, and also put a bone graft from my pelvis into the femoral head to strengthen it.  It was known then that the joint was far from perfect and would eventually wear out, but this solution would work well enough for a while.When all this took place, I was referred to the top orthopaedic surgeon in the area, and he spent time 1:1 with me and my parents going over everything, explaining how everything would work, showing us his drawings for what he planned to do.  He was very hands on and customized.  It was very personal.Fast-forward to last year, when I finally had my hip replaced.  Everything was impersonal, run through a system.  The “consultation” was done by a nurse in a classroom setting with a dozen or so others in line for hip replacements.  Time spent with the actual surgeon was as minimal as possible.Even better, when first investigating the possibility of getting my hip replaced, I met with an orthopaedist (not surgeon) who referred me to the surgeon.  This orthopaedist, not an American, made sure he also prescribed me a bunch of narcotic anti-inflammatories for my pain.  I never had the prescription filled, as I certainly didn’t need that.  I’d just take a couple Advil when I played golf.After the hip replacement operation, they prescribed me a 6-week supply of several narcotic pain killers and anti-inflammatories.  I lasted on that regimen for about 4 days and then stopped, as I didn’t like how I felt, and would just take Tylenol if the pain was bothering me.  The street value of all those pills was probably in the 5-figure range.  They’d even send instructions on how to dispose of them, and call me as a follow up to make sure I was ok and not addicted.  So you have unnecessary pain killer prescriptions and make-work for people to follow up to see if people are getting addicted.  What a grift.  I don’t recall being prescribed excessive amounts of narcotic pain killers after my surgery in the 1990s.To summarize, we’ve moved from personal, patient-focused medicine to a machine-like system which ensures it maximizes drugs prescribed.

            Several years ago, I had surgery done. Fortunately, I had 1-on-1 time with my surgeon, but I too was given prescriptions for heavy duty painkillers for post-op.
Anyway, the pain was never that bad and it made me wonder what the point of my prescription pain killers was except to waste money. I also wondered if perhaps some people were simply so weak they couldn’t handle the slightest amount of discomfort or pain.
So many weaklings abound nowadays.

        “If you want to understand fascist economics, spend some time in the American healthcare system.”If you can, watch the 1971 film, “The Hospital”, directed by Arthur Hiller. That more or less describes the whole US “healthcare” system in its venality and indifference to patients. The system is “private” only in the sense that if you don’t have insurance (and often even if you do), you’re liable for payment for medical services. The system is a network of rackets. Medical expenses are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the USA. The “healthcare” system is the most important reason — though there are others — to quit the country. The grass really is greener on the other side.I spent four days in hospital in 2020. I was billed $32,000 essentially for just a bed. A suite in a five-star hotel in Manhattan would probably have been cheaper. All sorts of “services” and tests I had no interest in, and which had nothing to do with my illness, were provided, and each cost from several hundred to thousands. Even the Sicilian mafia is not so venal.

            Just a quick bit of statistics regarding medical testing (this is accurate and backed up by multiple studies): in the US, over 70% of all outpatient medical laboratory testing is completely unnecessary. This is not saying that the tests were negative/normal. This is testing that met no relevant criteria for even being ordered. In the inpatient setting (admitted to hospital), the number is 90%!We see it every day. Inpatients with no suspicion of changes, getting CBCs and chemistry done every single day. They’re not big expenses, but in the tradition of successful money laundering schemes, lots and lots of little expenses eventually add up to real money.

        Thank you for sharing your check-up experience. You apparently have “high cholesterol” and were recommended a statin, which you refused (wisely, in my opinion.)Permit me to pontificate on this specific issue and some closely related, such as diet. In the past year I’ve deeply researched these and I feel I know a few things about it.The official dogma, of course, holds that “high cholesterol” is a primary driver of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and that it must be lowered. But here’s a question: What if this dogma is mostly, perhaps completely wrong?  Here is not the place to recount the tale of how saturated fat came to be demonized, or Pharma’s half-century quest to find drugs that knock down lipid numbers. You can find that info elsewhere if you’re curious. There are many books on the topic. I’m a fan of Dr. Malcolm Kendrick. You can get a taste of him from his website:https://drmalcolmkendrick.org/Some personal experience: I was on a statin, a blood pressure medication, baby aspirin, for nearly three years. All as a recommended preventative. A year ago I began to ask myself “Just how much of a benefit do these have?” I’ll skip the details, but a fair summary is (my opinion of course): Yes, these drugs do have benefits, these reduce incidence of heart attack, stroke and the like. But the benefit is so slight, is it really worthwhile? And there are inevitable costs: at the patient level, it costs hundreds of dollars per year in doctor’s visits, tests, and the drugs themselves (even if generic, as most of them are.) And how about the risk of adverse effects? These always exist and are usually glossed over. Statistically, these preventions scarcely will extend your life expectancy. Estimates vary, but in the case of statins, I’ve seen estimates their benefits are measured in added weeks, or a few months at best.In my own case, I asked myself “Is it really worth taking these drugs for twenty or more years, at an annual cost of (I calculated) $1000 out-of-pocket, incurring the risk of possible side effects, all for the promise of living an extra several months or a year when I’m in my decrepit 80s?” As you might guess, the answer came back “Hell no!” I unilaterally dropped the drugs. Any future preventive treatment, or even potentially risky diagnostics (I’ve had a few colonoscopies myself. No incidents, but they do have potentially serious complications. Finally, am I really at high risk, in other words, what is the expected value of the diagnostic? I want to know, beforehand.)Now consider some implications of the above. Those advisory committees, government health agencies, and the medical system as a whole promotes such treatments indicate serious flaws and conflicts of interest in the system. Statins alone are one of the most common health interventions. They cost governments and patients billions of dollars a year. They are claimed to be miraculous yet they have a minuscule benefit. But they DO benefit the Medical Guild. Profit$$$.If you really want to improve your health, start with your diet. Don’t trust the official recommendations. Is high fat bad for you? I disagree. I’ve had great results by going low carb (currently on Atkins). I lost 20 Lb. In less than three months. My lipid panel improved dramatically compared to readings a couple years earlier when my diet had more sugar and junk carbs.  My desire for sugary snacks has greatly declined.Even if I’m wrong (and sometimes I am), the principle still applies: Question everything. Do your own research. Don’t take anyone’s counsel, even your doctor’s, at face value.Now of course none of that proves that (say) Atkins is the answer or that low carb is without its risks. But it is first hand experience, a validation of the claims of an “alternative” health regimen that a person can see for himself, either on the bathroom scale or on a routine medical test.Here’s another tip I learnt. It’s an example of an (apparently) valid health metric, yet one that’s not yet become mainstream. It’s called the Atherogenic Index. Get your recent lipid panel. Divide triglycerides by HDL. (With the proviso that when the test was done, you were NOT taking a statin or other medications that influence your lipid levels)Is the number near 2 or even less? This indicates your cardiovascular health is likely excellent.Is the number closer to 5? That’s a red flag. It’s a marker that you are at higher risk for present or future CVD.Again, my personal experience: My junk-food era readings (5 years ago) were as high as 4.7. My most recent test, after two months of Atkins, is 1.8.I’d lay good money your doctor has never heard of this ratio, nor of newer tests that measure particle size (sub types of the various lipids.)  It’s a truism that large institutions change only very slowly. Medical dogma, and the treatments dispensed, are often based upon decades-old research. That’s bad enough, but doubly so when it’s been calcified by profit interests. Of course not all new research turns out to be valid. But the problem remains that the new, valid wisdom is only adopted very slowly and grudgingly – and that’s if it ever even gets a fair hearing, which it often doesn’t.Sorry if I’ve run on too long. I’ll wrap it up: Especially in the case of prevention, do your own research. Your doctor and other experts operate under many limitations, many potentially detrimental to the quality of care they’re supposed to provide. You can learn a lot by selective reading of books and Internet resources, many available free of charge. For example, on PubMed, a search of “atherogenic index” yields 1770 results. Not all are open access, but many are.Don’t believe just anything you may read of course, but verify when possible.The lies we tell ourselves are probably the most harmful. But a close second are those we believe from trusted advisors, whether they do so by ignorance, good intention or malice.

            Ben, what you touch upon is the concept of “relative risk” vs “absolute risk”.  So perhaps a “highish” blood pressure has an absolute risk of 1 in 10k of stroke or heart attack.  You take your prescribed “drug” and now you risk is reduced by half—1 in 20k—and of course you have whatever side effects risk.  Is this worth it?  Big Pharma love to advertise their new drug is twice as effective as their competitors old drug, but begs the issue of absolute risk.The other ploy is to get medical boards to lower their definitions of “normal”.  Within the last few years my age group has had “normal” BP redefined to 125 over 75 or something like than from 140 over 85 or something like that.  Now we have defined more than half the county’s population as abnormal.  I, of course, still have the same BP as I’ve had for years with no ill effect.Another term for the above is “treating the numbers”, rather than the disease.  My doctor is fully aware of my position on this.  If we disagree, he knows he has to show me the pathology—not a number taken from a blood test combined with some board’s recommendation of an “ideal” number.

                All very true. I’ve learned a lot of this, just in the past year. I even started a small site mostly with essays ripping off ideas from others (but admitting it) 😀
I do claim a bit of originality with this one, at least in the repackaging. I took one drug study and attempted to show the several varying (and apparently factual) conclusions one could draw from the data in the study. Some very flattering to those who promote such treatments, but others, not so much.

            CVD isn’t that hard to control. Get your LDL level below 70 mg/dL. Current AHA recommendations are 100 mg/dL or lower, which isn’t low enough.
Populations where people have LDL levels below 70 mg/dL never get CVD. It’s that simple.
Everything else is just nonsense.
