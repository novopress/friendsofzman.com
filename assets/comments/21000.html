        Back in March, we all thought we were headed towards a new Great Depression.  It didn‚Äôt happen.

Kudos to Z for having the intellectual honesty to address the reasons why, rather than kicking and screaming that it‚Äôs forever right around the corner, Peter Schiff-style.

            The joke about Schiff is that he‚Äôs predicted ‚Äú12 of the past 4 recessions‚Ä¶‚Äù.All things the same, Schiff and the Austrians are correct that the creation of credit by fiat leads to the situation at hand.  The banks have the ability to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù the economy strictly through the extension of credit.  However, they HAVE to lend at this point otherwise the negative interest rates prevail like they do in Europe.I‚Äôm inclined to the Peter Schiff pessimism.  Something breaks.  Where and what I have no idea but the powers that be are running this thing on spit and duct tape at this point.  Nobody knows what comes next‚Ä¶.

                Everyone sings the praises of the bankers on the way up.I don‚Äôt think timing is that important in the grand scheme of things in the event of a collapse.  But gold and silver will not protect you. That is my difference with Schiff. He has already left the US, at least on a part time basis and can always run to Israel. We have nowhere to run. The vast majority of Americans have no real savings to protect. They have a job and a house. Mass unemployment will devalue their house and lack of a job will be their biggest problem. Real prices of food and consumer goods would go through the roof.  Getting out of Dodge is really the only way you can be protected from what Schiff is predicting.

                    This isn‚Äôt the first time in history that this has happened.  The French Revolution had its assignats.  Precious metals and farm land are always the best protections for what‚Äôs coming.  And owning your dwelling outright.   What makes the US unique is just how long it has gone without a currency crisis.  There‚Äôs no generational memory for how to protect yourself.

                        I don‚Äôt think there is a good past analogy.  America is a far different place than revolutionary France. If anything, Tsarist Russia and Stalin are better examples.  The ethnic problems of the Early Soviet Union are pretty ignored today. From the mass starvation of the Ukrainians to the ethnic transfers Stalin did to quell the locals in various places are much closer to the US.  How are a bunch of Samalians going to affect Minnesota post collapse? Or the presence of generic Africans in every major city in the US? Various Mestizo groups?

                                Lineman, you should set up a survivalist timeshare company. Aquire some land with gravity fed water. Throw up a barn with cattle. build cheap functional cabins. sell time shares for summer vacations and a clause for permanent settlement should the shit hit the fan. Don‚Äôt know how one would exclude vibrant diversity. but if you might not have to actively if you advertised on sites like this one. Bitterroot Christian settlement. It would be sorta like a insurance policy for people living in the death traps to bug out to went the balloon goes up. Build enough meat on the bone for capitol improvements and getting more land and paying a manager.

You can have Us for neighbors or you can have Them.  The more of Us that live there, the less welcoming it is for Them and the fewer jobs, homes etc‚Ä¶ for Them to live in rather than Us.

                        Avoiding debt would seem to be good advice. As for gold, there is a world of difference between owning gold and owning paper purporting to give ownership, as many people will no doubt discover before too long. Even physical possession is no grantee against a government which decides that it‚Äôs need to own precious metals is the greater.

            We have to leave open the possibility that the crap has not hit the fan, but it is on its way. The end of unemployment checks will be an interesting development. The expiry of the eviction freeze is another. A trillion or so in magic money may simply have delayed the inevitable.
I suspect state politicians will now suddenly get religion on the economy. Their drama was underwritten by the Federal government.

                    yep. it will happen. the hamsters will be fed. just enough though, so they spin. it‚Äôs simple, the debt apocalypse never comes, because the doofuses keep working 60 hour weeks and refinancing their debts forever, to get Daddy a sugarbaby and a Mustang and transdaughter PreP and a Tesla.since we are officially all palace economies, we have to measure by the first most important asset of these: the slaves that keep it going. examples: Russia has oil and serfs and vodka factories, China has bees, India classy butterflies and worthless ants, Mexico coke-roaches; America has its hamsters, usually the lighter kind, feeding and preaching credit and consumption to the world.‚Ä¶ until the wheel breaks. perhaps because the hamsters eventually fatten up, degenerate, miscegenate, and die, as they power up the whole home ironically. perhaps the owners are just tired of hamsters, seeing that the hamsters are passe 90s pets now; and they instead wanna be getting diabetic from harvesting the bees‚Äô honey, while dealing with the other bugs. plus they do like to presume their solar panels too. but don‚Äôt worry, the owners will let these poor hamsters die in consuming pleasure. seems fitting. in the end we are all dead, said the owners‚Äô hamster-friendly pagan prophets, so they lay waste to the living by worshiping themselves through idolizing matter. some may even believe to be chosen.thus only God can get the sinners out of the cage. if not, we will just work to buy our fewer young ones robots, and then their robots will replace many of them as they work to give their even fewer young ones a trip to lower space; or some other bs gib that President Elon will pull out of his butt as a carrot for the ever dwindling hamster masses.oh and the robots and the algorithms and the blockchains will be owned by pump-and-dump friends, no escape there, did you see Bezos‚Äô dog?there will be more autonomous robot sex dolls than fair robot brokers, believe me. after all, elite humans like to fix scales and dumb down the populace with hookers since time immemorial, some more than others, but still‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ unless the information is hidden, which kind of defeats the purpose, but may be done with enough coordination. some may be able to go rogue and install servers and robots somewhere, creating parallel systems. for how long would these mythical offgrid communities remain though, who knows. the hamsters do power up drones too.meanwhile, whether the hamsters get too fat or anorexic or whatever, here‚Äôs hoping they stop. perhaps the way the cage rattles and falls apart surrounded by the other pests will be enough.

                    UBI was inevitable anyway. Automation has eliminated so many kinds of jobs and categories of jobs as the render the economy highly unstable.Hell even the job killers are unstable, things like Expedia which contributing to killing  most trip planning jobs (that used to be a decent jobs BTW) have lost 90% of business.Its going to get worse when the office has people working from home and not be called to go back. Ignoring the horrid social costs and work/life issues, the economic spill over effects will be profound.All those shops that serviced the office along with the office will just  dry up and blow away.Mostly the jobs we create don‚Äôt pay enough either to live or for family formation and we‚Äôve seen the results in record low fertility (biggest generation, fewest babies)Since there isn‚Äôt going to be hyper inflation or really much inflation in most areas, why not pay people off?

                The implosion already is beginning. State and local govt. pension funds soon will start blowing, like Puerto Rico, leading to dozens of bankruptcies, first in Blue States, then Red (see link). Unemployment will remain above 10% for 4 years. When a Dem wins in 2024 (not this year), everything will crash even faster. After that, who knows.https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-state-pension-crisis-goes-beyond-the-big-blue-states-11590791639

                    If GM (a pension that happens to build cars) is too big to fail, why not public pensions?Muni bonds and state pensions can be rolled into fed‚Äôs infinity balance sheet or some other public loss private profit Blackrock sidecar.Not that there wont be some cram-down where beneficiaries get a shit sammy. But half a shit sammy is better than nothing they will inform them.I am sure the process would involve a million billion transactions over some protracted timeline to keep the advisors and banks and certain underlying assets picked as winners long enough to send another generation of elites through Yale.All that economic paper activity would be a boom. Plus TPTB would get another massive asset repricing and consolidation event, which is nice.The other option is to cull the blue haired beneficiaries who are drawing on those over-promised bennies (covid-20) or carve out the medical portion of such and hitch them to medicare. Hell, why not all of the above.

                        the blue haired and other monkeys are already are on medicare, getting free emergency treatment at private hospitals, where do you think the infinity balance sheet comes from? it‚Äôs the lower middle segment that has no coverage, the famed donut hole left by the destruction of unions and their health plans. cover these more, and the bottom rung less, and charge the rent-owners at the top more instead of the producers in the upper middle.otherwise i agree, it‚Äôs what the fascists did a century ago, roll the public debts into some instrument that could be paid for by whoever was wealthy. the problem now is, so few are the elites who can repay these instruments, in effect the pyramid will remain smooth and steep because asset repricing and consolidation.and the half-shit sammy like you say is inevitable, in fact it might have to be a big sammy if there‚Äôs nothing else to eat‚Ä¶ because after all, the elites are now global. back when fascists or any other movements or governments redistributed, they could fall back on local industry and autarchy (and dare i say order and tradition) generating a new elite to replace the degenerate one, economic and otherwise. today instead we are talking of robot brokers.if the brokers are replaced, then their clients would simply talk to a machine on the phone for longer, while still getting screwed. in fact, if robots really did away with human intrigue and negotiation, then whoever owned them would just own the means of production‚Ä¶ and dispense them, or not.

                    As a retired college professor and ‚Äúproud‚Äù recipient of CalSTRS pension money you need to understand that CalSTRS, while about 64% funded at the moment, has a plan. We gots a plan, OK.The plan is that the state and the districts will make everything right by 2046. Got it.We are going to make a killing in the stock market while also being SJWs about who we invest in.  The stock marketcannottank, the federal governmentwillbail out the fund, and whats left of the stupid middle class will fill in the gaps with tax increases.You need to understand that the CA government unions pick the state politicians. And the TPTB tell these totally dependent parasites what to think. It is a win/win. If Gov Newsom came out on Monday and told the parasites to jump up and down 4 times on their left leg while humming the Hamilton theme song to keep COVID at bay then the parasites would do it, gladly. And declare that they are following the science. We always follow science and the facts; we are not racist flyover idiots who believe in magic.Now at some point it ends but when that is nobody knows and the vast majority of ‚Äúeducators‚Äù think that the magic money tree is real and incredibly most think they are underpaid even though a number of retired college teachers pull in a 6 figure annual pension.

                    Pensions will be allowed to go under before gibs, particularly EBT, but they will be bailed out up until that trade-off has to happen. One major driver of the Left‚Äôs furious power grabs is in fact the pending implosion of pension systems.

                                Not really.  Its not like they‚Äôll get in come otherwise and the odds are very good that unemployment will end up morphing into UBI or if the economy picks up they ca be hired back.If you want conscientious workers focused on the long term it costs money regardless of skill level.This does mean that a lot of  business models need to change which won‚Äôt be easy.Getting say many slaughter houses and  meat packers to do the minimum for safety requires a huge armed federal bureaucracy and many of them would rather shut down and starve people than change.Thus meat shortages.It make same understand why the Soviets  sent people to labor camps to be honest.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm no Red and what was being asked of them was unreasonable. Still some people are so truculent they won‚Äôt even do reasonable things,its very bad for society at large and for the same reason we don‚Äôt allow fentanyl for recreation, we can demand reasonable measures for public safety.At this moment however, its not certain the union will make it past  this year. Democrats are off war gaming succession and coup and everyone else is arming up.

                        You need to get used to this as it‚Äôs unfortunately your future. For example I have a work colleague who‚Äôs father is trying to build a house in Mexico. A strange pastime for a retired British civil servant perhaps, but he has recently taken ownership of a Mexican woman and  needed somewhere to keep her.  Anyway, he decided to combat the notorious Mexican work ethic by paying an extremely generous bonus to his workers after they had finally completed some task or other in the hope that he would see some improvement in their punctuality as a result. Sadly he was disappointed, in fact he didn‚Äôt see any sign of the work force until the bonus was finally spent. It seems that Mexicans AKA new Americans have highly developed ability to judge the absolute minimum of labour required to avoid starvation and consider doing anything more as a matter of deep personal shame. On the plus side, at least they‚Äôre not Pakis, you have at least have that to be grateful for.

                            The thing about the Protestant work ethic is that it is only suitable when enough  gains go to the man doing the work. No one in Mexico is going to get ahead nor will a moderate pittance of a bonus improve the life of an 90IQ Mestizo in any meaningful long term way so why bother?Given the situation in Mexico and to a lesser degree in the US  its outright cuckholdry to work hard for the man when you aren‚Äôt forced too.

                                This is a big part of the dilemma.  The Prot work ethic is a moral gloss to a sucker‚Äôs bargain unless the worker has meaningful work ‚Äì a family &amp; home to support and/or work that really provides a sense of accomplishment and purpose, not just a McJob.
Our economy does a shitty job of that largely because of scale and wealth concentration issues, as well as a consumer aesthetic that prefers cheap mass produced goods instead of artisanal craftsmanship and quality.

                            Clearly Mexicans do honest work at least sometimes, or else they wouldn‚Äôt be in demand in the USA. I‚Äôm not sure how current this is, but here‚Äôs an anecdote from a Rand book if I recall. An American corporation had a small plant in Mexico. A visiting executive figured out how he could double the productivity of the line. As the employees were paid piece rate not hourly, their wages would double. The old Mexican boss smiled, shook his head, and voiced doubt it‚Äôd work. No matter, the  changes were made and put into operation at the next month‚Äôs start. The new plan worked well for two weeks. But one morning, none of the workers showed up. Explanation? The workers had made a month‚Äôs wages in two weeks, and there was no reason to work for the rest of the month. üôÇ

                                Those Mexican workers may not necessarily shine on IQ tests, but they‚Äôre clearly not stupid. When making the window and door openings for this same house they are careful to make them all uniquely different sizes, thereby guaranteeing work for their neighbour the carpenter. No mass produced plastic Chinese windows are gonna be putting him out of work.

                            The US is guaranteed a catabolic collapse because of wage arbitrage.Wages must come up to an immigration ban and family stability imposed but the people with power cannot and will not allow itSo  baring a war or radical forced change  over the long term,  collapse is certain.Society has become more and more  costly to operate and the things that are required to mitigate that, increasing wages and decreasing social costs are impossible so the system will fall.In the short term, mass money printing and handouts can hold the line a bit but if we don‚Äôt fix this situation fast, we are all screwed.

                                So long as you pay into the household fund, its fine.If you are bothering with nookie. go rent a motel room.We assume that its a good idea to split families.Its not.Extended families are in every way better than nuclear families. We push  nuclear families mainly to pump consumption and because its the smallest, weakest, stable configuration.A large extended family has littl eneed for the state and if big enough and mean enough can even protect itself to a high degree.What it doesn‚Äôt do is consume as much which a growth based, Mammon loving economy can‚Äôt have.

                        The average salary in this berg is about $20-22k.  That $400+ a week or so.  You add $600 on top of State unemployment of $240 and you‚Äôre sitting pretty.  Since those type of jobs are pretty much at the bottom end, you can pick one of them up anytime, anywhere.

                    And saved. More money has been saved at this point than I think ever, before.The big money boys at the Fed were talking about stopping people from saving that transfer payments but its pointless as most of the people who needed them spent them and those that didn‚Äôt who got say a stimulus, could just pay bills with that and save the earnings.High savings also suppress inflation and while yield is low to zero, so is price inflation.Covid and the stupid appears to have killed consumerism , no idea what comes next. Hopefully not ideology and war.

                            Won‚Äôt work. The supply chains can‚Äôt handle the shock.Also bills still need to be paid and having people go without electricity or homeless won‚Äôt fix the velocity of money, quite the contrary.Lastly, people who still have an income can just shift earned funds to bills and debt reduction anyway. They are the issue, not the suddenly poor.As far as long term fix, if you want efficiency in your economy, go to a basic income of 1200-2400 a month for everyone for good.If you are able or willing to regulate or capable of long term planning which we aren‚Äôt, debt default, reindustrialization , autarky and bimetallism along with an immigration freeze/reversal.My guess is we‚Äôll do nothing though and who knows what will happen with mass poverty hunger and homelessness, ethnic divisions and guns lots of guns.

                    yes, we knew the rich had to get their free lunch first, several courses of course.
there‚Äôs legit too many bums too though, which doesn‚Äôt help, they are only given lunches when needed. and of course there‚Äôs the willing cogs in the middle.

                This is also my take on things.  No evictions + government handouts for basic expenses means that there‚Äôs a feeling that nothing has changed.  Officially there‚Äôs 30% or so unemployment but until the money stops it won‚Äôt matter that much.

                i think every branch of government from a town in maine to the federal gov are operating at a defecit state right now. they are buying stuff they will not be able to pay for when the bill come in. I think they are counting on the dems printing them all masses of money when they take power after the election . this may or may not be what happens.  I really don‚Äôt think they understood the economics of the shutdown they did. they businesses they runout of existence because they were owned by republicans took a lot of other industries with them and the staggering loss of tax revenue may not have been expected .  there is also a major exodus from the blue cities that will take a lot of revenue with them . Who knows. to me this is a forest fire of unplanned consequences that nobody can predict.

            That argument is like watching the first five minutes of a two hour murder mystery movie and proclaiming that no one got murdered.  March was four months ago.  This is a long haul.  Peter Schiff is like a broken clock.  It is right twice a day, and it‚Äôs half past 11.  What Schiff does know is that you can‚Äôt get or have something from nothing.  A sacrifice must be made for everything.  Consumption must somehow come from production.

                Four months is plenty of time for warning signs to set in.
Where‚Äôs the inflation?  Why are tourist zones still packed?
Life isn‚Äôt all that much different than February, except everyone wears a mask and the professional class works from home now.
There‚Äôs plenty of evidence that in a credit-based economy, the classical rules no longer apply.

                                    The stock market is the first sign of inflation.  Ten years from now, Tesla will be selling their cars for 10 million fiat buck each.
2 thousand fiat bucks a share for Tesla is a bargain.
Going forward people will still loose thier shirts on the stock market, but it will look different.

                                        why would Tesla be successful?otherwise i agree. the bottom and middle will simply disengage more from the top, even if eased into it with ubi and free credit and netflix and chill culture. it‚Äôs not noticeable now because the distance is so big, and the top knows how to keep the others busy. it‚Äôs like knowing the sun is incredibly much larger than what is seen in the sky, but distance and the atmosphere and the warmth make it palatable.eventually many will have their wealth severely reduced, but the drones will simply be over them, and they will simply have to keep ordering netflix and grubhub and die with the mask on webcam. it‚Äôs not about keeping the slave in a ball and chain anymore, more about having a nice vr helmet on his head until his bloodline is sterile enough. ironically these means the more brutish will swallow this middle rung, while the top disengages to Elysium safezones between wastelands. again, castizo experience.do you think the rich will allow the poor free/cheaper family formation? maybe. do you think they will offer the poor, even those few with higher iq, free/cheaper birth control and abortions and porn and tranny drugs? definitely. Elon probably wants a colony so these rich flee in the end from the ensuing disaster. still affected by his youth i bet.

                                Heinlein is a master of sarcastic humor.

This is scarely economical by any conceivable use of energy. Yet after the Moon rebels, it‚Äôs official motto is TANSTAAFL (‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt so such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù)

                            It can go on for a very long time so long as the velocity of money is kept low.Discussing the complexities of demand would require a blog of my own, not that I am an economist but as far as I can figure consumerism has collapsed.This means between debt and lack of ways to spend money or invest in money isn‚Äôt moving which means in anything that isn‚Äôt high demand . inflation will be low.Food is excluded here as there is a global food crisis as is ammo for obvious reasons but its very possible money printing will be a many many years thing if only to avoid widespread disorder

                    i think eventually the moral and mental, and even physical, degeneracy created by this lack of scarcity, will break the dam somewhere. materially everyone has a lot, but people are weary or bored, only living the moment, and therefore prone to ignore evil to try to keep sane. still, many somehow feel ‚Äúsomething ain‚Äôt right‚Äù. when the productive works at the Amazon warehouse 12-16 hour days, while the monkey collects checks and rapes outside at night, and it happens in the same neighborhood everywhere in America, maybe something will change. until then, we are on a slow drip.

                We are already in a depression with 35% GDP decline.Problem is there is zero demand for labor that pays well, requires moderate skills and can support a family in an urban society.Demand for low skill, modest pay jobs is declining too. Kiosks and Apps reduce employment in food serviceGiven the labor surplus even without immigration, wages are easy to arbitrage down,Ultimately to prevent favella nation and or race war now we have to paper it over as there is no way to raise wages or to lower prices to meet wages.

        Quantum economics also stresses the importance of financial transactions and in particular the role of money as an active force in the economy, for example in the way that it entangles debtors and creditors through loans‚Ä¶and service providers that are making the most of money‚Äôs virtual side‚Ä¶fromThe Evolution of Moneyby Orrell &amp; Chulupaty.So virtual money funding virtual promises yields a virtual pot of gold at the end of the rainbow‚Ä¶if and only if we never get to the end of the rainbow?  It only exists if we never get there? If we get there it won‚Äôt exist? Schrodinger‚Äôs Payoff?‚Ä¶But what happens when the system slows or begins to lock up and virtual money has no value because the people who own it have no real assets? Or to protect the assets the money changers do have most of the population finds itself priced out of the market because their access to virtual money has been cut off?Would bond buyers be willing to continue purchasing bonds to maintain a system that has begun to rattle apart and may never give them a return?If I go to the track and everyone who places a bet to win,place or show gets nothing‚Ä¶only the owner of the horse get a winning stake‚Ä¶what happens when people are no longer willing to place a bet? The owner‚Äôs pool also dries up.  Foreign investment is going to find a situation this volatile worth the risk?This all has a pyramid scheme flavor to it where everyone outside of the elitist of elites ends up holding the bag.Many of those getting the shaft will be smart, organized, armed and highly motivated to rebuild and begin again from scratch if they need to‚Ä¶after they settle some old scores.

            Would bond buyers be willing to continue purchasing bonds to maintain a system that has begun to rattle apart and may never give them a return?They must or the system will fail. Their very financial survival depends on them continuing to believe. How is faith destroyed in the system? You have to devalue the checks that the average person gets whether it be from work or the government. That‚Äôs why people are content to sit home and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..wait to see what happens. They are getting paid and don‚Äôt have to work, so it‚Äôs not a bad deal for them, but the smart ones are scared. They are like little forest critters who smell the hint of smoke.

            the horse owner is also the owner of the venue, and has total power to bar competition on either end, or simply he is part of a racket. so even though his gambling operation is worthless, he now just raises ticket venue on those semi-rich who can‚Äôt own horses (stock) or venues (bonds) ever, while giving out free caviar at the exit. most people will only afford watching on tv with potato chips, as they won‚Äôt be allowed to have wages to gamble away.

        BMW is trying to copy Tesla in the worst possible sense. While Tesla wants to charge you a monthly fee for certain additional software related features, BMW actually wants to start charging a monthly subscription to use the features built into the car!  One might assume a seat comes as part of the purchase price of a car, but BMW recons it can charge a monthly subscription for the heated seats functionality.https://www.forbes.com/sites/alistaircharlton/2020/07/02/bmw-wants-to-charge-you-a-subscription-for-your-heated-seats/#4628b3403c64

            You are touching on a point I‚Äôve been making for years wrt that computer on wheels called a car.  Who owns the software required to make the car operational?  Even more important, why can car manufacturers refuse to modify the software to allow third party equipment modifications/additions?  All this hardware-software interface appears to me to be a restraint of trade case waiting to be filed.

                I can think of many reasons. The biggest one for the manufacturers is liability issues. Software failures can be fatal. Examples can be found of, at least, passenger plane crashes killing large numbers, that were blamed on a software failure. Almost as big is the re-liablity issue. Sure, the user can in theory tweak the code because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhis property,‚Äù but adding 20 LB boost on the turbo full time is not good for the engine, but it is damned impressive the teenaged boy man until the engine melts  üòÄProbably this can vary, but usually the actual owner can go ahead and make changes, but it voids the warranty.

                    But this has always been true even before the days of chipping and then reprogramming. Not only that, but there are usually disclaimers in the warranty that using the car for purposes not intended such as off road, drag racing or even using the car as a source of energy will void the warranty.  At one point in the 60s Chrysler was selling hemi packages that came with a simple 30 day warranty that covered little more than if the engine was bad right off the bat.

        History is pretty good predictor of the fate of economic bubbles. The only thing novel about our current bubble is it‚Äôs enormity. Ask a Venezuelan about life in a post bubble-collapse world. And we are a bifurcated people now. When the going gets tough, the productive will roll up their sleeves and go to work, and the other half will whine and bitch and riot for government gravy. And there will be jackboots to quell the unrest and enslave the dwindling productive class. And it all will be done for the ‚ÄúGreater Good.‚Äù

                Yes, reality is reality, and it‚Äôs best to accept reality as it is and deal with it rather than bemoan it‚Äôs downside. All tyrannies require an enforcement corps, and most of the jackboots are simply ordinary Joe‚Äôs doing a job. Accept that reality and work around it. The path to victory over tyranny does not involve fighting the peons on the bottom of the social pyramid, be they jackboots or deranged rioters. Focus your efforts where is matters most.

        So the new economy is not about production any longer, it‚Äôs about middle men, people who do tranzactions, moving capital from one hand to another.It makes sense if we view current US economy as a cog of the entire global economy that mostly focuses on moving capital based on its jewish ideology. Basically as long as China &amp; other asian countries produce goods &amp; accept dollar as transaction currency in foreign exchange markets, US economy won‚Äôt fall, despite massive unemployment.In conclusion USA might have massive unempoyment, but China does not, thus US economy will keep going.

                No you should worry. What is China forced to do when we print massive amounts of money? That inflation goes somewhere. The currency peg ensures those nations that use a peg eat the inflation. We are financing our modern economy with the slave labor of the third world, in a sense.

                    If/when it all breaks down, let us assume that the US Dollar, or at least the Federal debt, quickly becomes worthless. On the one hand, this will of course be a slap in the face of major trading partners who hold the bulk of our debt. On the other hand, it‚Äôll be payback to the USA in the sense that we had greatly benefitted these countries over a long period with such things as exporting much of our industry and jobs to them (China and others), providing essentially free military umbrella for much of the world (Europe, Japan, etc.).

                that‚Äôs also another reason they want to keep the slaves consuming, the dollar is propped up by it as globalist currency. meanwhile the Chinese can afford to pay their peasants in yuan crumbs and also work them a lot more to death and depression because of their materialist-imperial commie ways, yet at least give them sweeter compensation in public services (for the time being) and ethno-cultural pride (ditto). the US prices its peasants out with the expensive dollar, so they must be made to work and consume for their atomized selves while community and culture breaks down due to lack of public caring. two sides of materialism, the one collective, the other individual, one usually devolving into the other because none are meant to last.the key question is, how fat can the hamsters get, before their wheels (which power everything) break down. that‚Äôs why both systems fail. the Chinese with their higher iq and materialism will kick the can down the road, but eventually they will too get fat and tired of spinning, even if at higher speeds. that dam may not break, but the environmentalist crap China will get for record summer rain (nevermind solar cycles) will make them spend into bureaucracy even more, those hamsters can indeed get very fat. meanwhile, growing numbers of lonely people in apartments i bet, single women encouraged to live it up, single men encouraged to live it down. when will the dam break, who knows, but water keeps rising‚Ä¶

                We avoid much of the consequences of money creation because the dollars are quickly exported. But what happens if overseas transactions slow significantly and the dollars are stuck in the US like a backed up toilet?

                    You have to remember that 401Ks were the answer to a real problem. A shrinking population is incapable of supporting a welfare state. The libertarians who came up with the scheme didn‚Äôt envision this, of course. 401Ks were suppose to be exposed to market risks. You took your chances but nobody was on the hook for your expensive pension, but nobody could take it away from you if you got lucky. However, in retrospect it should have been obvious what would happen.

                        Here‚Äôs an interesting podcast. Mike Green makes an entertaining, maybe even solid, case that, among other things, Index funds risk collapsing the market. What once began as a very sensible idea (an index fund to passively invest and have super low expenses), has, in a few decades, come to be a lot (50%? More?) of the stock market. Green claims that if say, Vanguard ever has to sell more than a tiny bit of its gargantuan holdings, it could seize the entire market because there are not enough counter-parties that could act as buyers, in his argument the price of a stock would gap quickly to zero.https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0003/#2020 has been a weird year, and barely half over. A pandemic, oil (briefly) at negative $37 a barrel, and with a dicey election ahead, so why not a stock market crash and depression because somebody wants to unload a block of stock?

            part of it is that most people have been soma‚Äôd to sleep by (((them))). gentiles are just cattle in their own little atomized worlds.when revolts happened historically, it was either massive hunger, or a massive bloody crime against the people. the blacks certainly lie a lot about their dead criminals at the hands of police, among other things, but they are certainly effective at garnering sympathy using their spilled blood. the Russian Revolution could only happen after the massacre of the martyrs, and not before. in fact, Christianity could take hold and somewhat harmoniously unite white people, and eventually a lot of the world, due in no small part to the blood of its martyrs.civil war doesn‚Äôt seem heroic when it seems to be carried out only by antifags and bugout weirdos. a breaking point situation will need to come and slap the sense out of people.

                    I am wondering about the face shield thing too. Again, allowing for new disease, developing situation and all that, but I have my suspicions. Most reports say that the virus is mostly transmitted by small exhaled droplets, possibly by smaller particles, but nearly all transmission is by air. So a face shield or eye protection is not going to offer any protection except against a ‚Äúdirect hit‚Äù such as being sneezed at. Similar for the plexiglas panels and dividers now seen at restaurants and such. These will help but to me at least, only with ‚Äúprojectile‚Äù sitautions üôÇ   So yeah, shields make sense in certain situations, but unless you‚Äôre in a special siuation where you are directly exposed to breath or spittle from others, I don‚Äôt see what wearing a face shield gains one.Looked at another way, the paranoid could say this is just another step in the conditioning, to see how much the sheep will accept.

From the looks of now, our overlords will determine, with the input of IMF/globalist banks and international Mordor, when and why they take us down and drop kick us. When it is to their advantage and nothing whatever to do with ours.Also pushing Their hand is massive population growth of Mr. Oingo Boingo‚Äôs family continent.

        I believe the last paragraph touches on the end-game for this.  I think we‚Äôre in the end-game now, which will take six or seven years to play out.  I have some points:1)  Tesla is a fraudulent company on par with WorldCom and Enron, and exceeding them both by far in brazenness.  The CEO literally tweeted a few weeks ago that the SEC stands for suck Elon‚Äôs C..k.2) The willful blindness by the big accounting firms and ratings agencies is worse than in 2008, after they promised to clean up their acts.  Instead of crediting warrantee reserves like every other auto company, Tesla is booking warrantee repairs under goodwill, which is also used to side-step state lemon laws.  This one accounting trick keeps a lot of the red ink at bay.  In my fantasy PWC ends up like Arthur Andersen over this.3) None of the accounting shenanigans matter because Tesla has a customer base (and investor base) of earth-worshipping Trekkies who see it as an emblem of the future.  It‚Äôs amazing and saddening how many brilliant people I know who are just so stupid when it comes to the green energy con.  Elon is saving the world, leave him alone.  The CEO‚Äôs empty promises on everything from brain implants to robo-taxis is part of that techno mystique.  We‚Äôre going to Mars!4) Tesla, like some many other zombie companies, exists solely because of Fed policy, and artificially low interest rates since the late 80‚Äôs and especially since 2001.  If you think about it, Delorean had to do everything Tesla is doing, but with 20% interest rates.  That‚Äôs why he got into cocaine trafficking.5) Japan is still a creditor nation, unlike us, that‚Äôs why they can carry the debt load they carry.  The Japanese central bank has pretty much bought up Japanese bonds and now owns something like a quarter of Japanese stocks.  What‚Äôs going on in Japan is a leveraged buyout of the Japanese economy by the central bank.  The Fed is doing the same.  US Treasuries are at an all time low precisely because the ‚Äúbond vigilantes‚Äù were bought out by the Fed.  Don‚Äôt look to the bond market for answers on this.  They too are zombie bitten.  The Fed, just as Japan, will create a vehicle to buy stock indexes as soon as we have a major correction, and the market knows this, keeping the market levitated for now.6)  Italy and Greece are being backstopped by the ECB (Germany) and would have cracked a couple years ago without intervention.  Italy is still a basket case that must be dealt with.7)  Inflation hasn‚Äôt materialized much in the consumer economy because much of what‚Äôs being created is mostly bank reserves.  We‚Äôve been very lucky since 2008 (not for homebuyers) that we‚Äôve mostly had asset price inflation from these excess reserves, and the bank loans made from them.  As the Government spends like drunken sailers, this hot money will spur domestic inflation, hence the precious metals rallies as of late.8)  The central banks of the world can control pretty much every market by simply buying or backstopping it.  But there‚Äôs one market that they just can‚Äôt control.  It‚Äôs far too big, and that‚Äôs the foreign exchange market.  The only way to do that is to have a free hand on interest rates.  They‚Äôre stuck at zero bound.  So we will have a dollar crisis from this, and it will be far from the only currency in crisis.  When?  I would have Jeff Beezos money if I knew that.9)  The final chapter of the endgame (years from now) only has three options for governments.  1)  Default and let interest rates soar.  2)  Inflate away the debt.  or 3) a mix of both, which they‚Äôll likely do.  The US will not adjust well to its new, Mexico like standard of living.

                    I did part of TDAmeritrade‚Äôs online options course, so I know the basics. I‚Äôve toyed with the play money account they give you. What surprised me is how expensive options are. Now, I know they have certain ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù uses like to hedge. I was interested in them forgamblingspeculation. The most damning datum didn‚Äôt come from thehousebrokerage (Imagine that!): that about 90% of options expire worthless. Why? The only possible answer is because the people who write options are very smart. They know that most of them won‚Äôt be exercised. Of course it‚Äôs all subjective, and the risks will vary with market conditions, but it seems to me a call or put buyer is paying quite a premium for relatively little protection. Imperfect analogy: to me, buying an option one month out, even 10 or 20 % up or down, the premium you‚Äôre asked to pay might be like paying $4000 to insure a $100,000 home against fire ‚Äî for just a month.And most fortunately, for me, is that I don‚Äôt qualify to trade options üòÄ

                        I generally sell options because time (theta) decay works in the option seller‚Äôs favor.
Buying options is a totally different animal. On Tesla, I would only buy options to speculate in a day trade if the indicators I use were telling me that it is a good idea to buy ATM puts on Tesla that day.
Otherwise, buying and holding options on Tesla is largely a fool‚Äôs errand because all your premium (the money you paid) gets eaten up by the incredibly high theta (time) decay on Tesla options.

            All this cheap credit allows people to buy a Tesla as well.  The $35k is mostly fake from what I can gather.What I really don‚Äôt understand is why so many people are enamored by electric vehicles.  Turning the fleet electric faces major obstacles.  One many don‚Äôt seem to think of is how this would work in America‚Äôs old cities. There are huge swaths of my city where nobody has a garage. There is no assigned parking either, nor fixed defined parking spots.Installing outdoor charging stations with either a credit card reader or a plug related identification system is the only real way this can be dealt with.  That is going to cost trillions of dollars across all of the cities. It has to be built around the worst case scenario where every car charger in an entire neighborhood is plugged in at the same time. This is not especially unlikely given that most people work around the same time and get home around the same time.For fast charging on the interstate, particularly because they want to see 18wheelers go electric is going to require large power plants near every rest stop. The amounts of energy required to fast charge is enormous. Charging a single megawatt battery in an 18 wheeler engineered to be charged in 5 minutes would require 20 megawatts. Presumably we would want to re-create whatever exists in these rest stops, just electric instead of gas. So maybe 20 pumps for gas and 5 for the trucks. That‚Äôs a lot of juice.

                    Electric is sexy and on the surface is ‚Äúclean.‚Äù Liberals love that. And, admittedly, it reduces local pollution.

                The physics aren‚Äôt even there for 18 wheelers to work.  Your Amazon package would cost $500 in shipping.  A large, conceited swath of the population is conditioned to believe (much like the mask people with fake ass COVID) that their consumer choice of buying an electric car will literally change the temperature of the earth.  And Atheists mock Noah‚Äôs Ark?  Intelligence is not critical thinking.  Anyone who scores high on a critical thinking test would not own an electric vehicle.  The electric grid is also incapable of handling that even if they caught on to any degree.  I was at a golf club in the bay area where  80% of the cars were Teslas.  They‚Äôre the emblem of a certain class that was buying Volvo 240 Wagons in the 70s.  It‚Äôs going out of style though.  Elon said nice things about Trump two months ago.

I guess it is highly dictated by the needs of the site.  Presumably this is a lot cheaper than diesel where it is possible.

                This is one case where our American use of imperial units can hurt us.  American cars are rated in horsepower while in other countries they use the metric unit, kilowatts.  Think about how your basic economy sedan might have 130 hp.  That‚Äôs 100 kw. 100,000 watts! 100 hair dryers going at once.  Just plug in 100 hair dryers at home and turn them all on and see what happens.  If your main breaker is 100 amps your whole house is able to provide about 1/10 of the power your little Honda (or your 100 hair dryers) uses.  Behold the magic of hydrocarbon energy storage.

                            America used to have great public transportation. But now they are just a gibs program because they are dangerous because of vibrants.

Just like the ‚Äúinner city‚Äù has been destroyed.In my city these are all of the neighborhoods surrounding the central business districts and also the colleges. Temple University is right in the middle of one these ghettos. The kids can‚Äôt walk around at night because of the realities of living in the ghetto and that‚Äôs even with a very heavily police presence.

        We are truly living in strange times where nothing makes sense anymore ‚Äì at least those tried and true things we always took for granted.  And the coronatard fear/uncertainty keeps churning along, retarding any semblance of returning to some kind of normalcy.  I guess tens of millions of people out of work, a stunted economy, 401ks going to the moon for no apparent reason, or collecting one‚Äôs ubi fro uncle sugar IS the new norm.

                I wasmaskedtoday. I went to the outdoor farmers market, which has lanes separating everybody by tapes, at 645am by habit because in former times the restaurants would all call for the best items at 7. It was sparsely populated but except for me they were all old hags. I purchased my desired items as the hags would pull up to me and scream ‚Äúwhere is your mask!!!‚Äù and I would ignore them. I bought my final item with a faggot screaming in my ear, ‚Äúyou need to leave sir!!‚Äù At which point I told him, quite honestly, that if he continued to violate social distancing I would whoop his queer ass. I then departed for home.I tell my good friend about this event, not my first rodeo, and he‚Äôs one of us but said anyway, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just go along with it.‚Äù I cannot for the life of me acquiesce to these Karens and fags.Apparently I‚Äôve awoken in a parallel universe or something. Jeebus, when did it come to this bullshit? Everything is completely fake. Was I slipped LSD or something? I‚Äôm ready to put them against the wall.

                            Holy shit! Girlfriend, get your butt moved and gone.Went to the post office yesterday in small town amerika, just me and 2 plygs (FLDS polygamists in their big hair and long dresses. Rather have plygs as neighbors than obsequious  stupid Fs). You laugh! But the 3 of us didn‚Äôt mask up. 8 people came in behind all masked up looking furtive and scared. My height lengthened, my shoulders straight and tall, have learned to stare with an 8 on the Ricter Scale look. When forced, I do wear a mask‚Ä¶under my nose. So far not messing with The Range. Will pick my battles.

                In the scene you describe, his mistake was putting on a mask in his car withI assumehands that had just touched the gas pump (without being sanitized.) While transmission by air is far more likely than by contact, what that customer did probably exposed him to a random sample of a few dozen people‚Äôs hand germs. Not wise.If I‚Äôve read the scene correctly, it is a good example of crazy. Not , as you might think, because wearing a mask is foolish. But you just described someone who is pretending to take the precautions but doing it wrong, in fact in this case, probably upping his risk of catching COVID-19.

        Old story, but relevant ‚ÄìA Tourist stops at the motel and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one to spend the night.As soon as the man walks upstairs, the owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the pig farmer.The pig farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill at the feed store.The guy at the Farmer‚Äôs Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute, who has also been facing hard times and has had to offer her services on credit.She rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill with the motel owner.The motel proprietor now places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money &amp; leaves.No one produced anything‚Ä¶and no one earned anything‚Ä¶however the whole town is out of debt and is looking to the future with much optimism.

            The whole town is out of debt and each has fewer assets by the same amount of debt they retired. Their net financial position is unchanged (assuming equal credit quality of assets and liabilities)If they are more optimistic it reflects a different psychological perception of owing and owning, the latter is less important than the former.

        There is a huge struggle going on world wide, between at least two factions.  assets are being sacrificed for no real purpose in a panic.   that is the other bizarre phenomena to the one zman is discussing.  e.g. the sports leagues are being explicitly politicized even though that is catastrophic to their survival.  it is this opaque struggle that is causing the distortion effects you talk about; it is putting tons of energy into the current system, and burning it off at the same time ‚Äî a transient equilibrium.

But the reason the meme is so believable is that the larger phenomenon of radicalized teachers is true and well-documented:https://dailycaller.com/2017/09/01/public-school-teachers-behind-violent-antifa-group/
So the point about idiot conservatives unwittingly sending their own kids and grandkids into seppuku still stands.

            Republicans: ‚ÄúWe must reopen the schools! Send our kids back! Our kids must be taught to hate themselves! Their inductions into BLM and antifa await!‚Äù
This was an awesome opportunity to wean society from the teat of State (re-)education, and of course the GOP blew it. Many parents may see good reason to home school now.

If cops can‚Äôt protect people from real crime, and all they ever do is arrest people who defend themselves from BLM attackers, why bother keeping them around? Defund them and the world will be a whole lot better.

                Near where I live in Orlando, I was coming home one night and a girl was out in the street to stop my car. I sped up to about 45 and she jumped out of the way at the last moment. I would have killed her.
Later, at home, I told the wife. She said she had read a guy had been robbed and killed there a week before.
I don‚Äôt ever stop. Get in from of me and I will not stop.

            Seriously vegetius. I learn something new every day. From how to ask the right questions, to framing the argument; honing a longstanding position, and expanding the universe of things I don‚Äôt know, I always come away energized. There is no shortage of ability. Our challenge is one of will.
One more thing we have let slip through our fingers with the loss of our communities is the IRL forum. The public house conversations and heated debates among friends and occasional adversaries where ideas and beliefs are born, challenged, strengthened and most importantly ‚Äì shared.

        One of the distinguishing features of a scientific theory is its ability to make reliable predictions ‚ÄìEconomics is the most dismal science in this respect.Quantum economics may be like quantum physics in the sense that no one really understands it, but Planck‚Äôs black box theory yields very consistent and reliable results.Quantum economics is more black bag than black box, as it should be considering its experimental results.Hyper-concentration of wealth with the other 99.9% losing ground. The complete de-coupling of fundamentals from stock performance and valuation. The overt integration of the managerial private sector with the managerial government class (aka oligarchy). Real world assets divorced from money creation, the supply or scarcity of which is entirely stage-managed by a privileged elite who can step in and out of the virtual casino like Agents in the Matrix.Don‚Äôt bother calling the police, the shillers are already in the house. Hell, they ARE the house ‚Äì and they‚Äôre paying the cops to take a knee to everyone but thee.When you find yourself in a rigged game, the only winning move is to walk away. Cash out while you still can ‚Äì at least enough for a soft landing back in the Desert of the Real.These tables have ‚Äúquantum‚Äù limits now, and no one knows what that means. Paraphrasing Feynman‚Äôs famous quotes on quantum mechanics:‚ÄúI think it is safe to say that no one understands Economics.¬†One does not, by knowing all the financial laws as we know them today, immediately obtain an understanding of anything much. The more you see how strangely the market behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work. So economics has given up on that.‚Äùhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bag_operationhttps://www.spaceandmotion.com/quantum-mechanics-richard-feynman-quotes.htm

Better yet, learn how the grift operates, extract money from it, then use that money to purchase real, tangible assets like food, gold, ammo, or even land.

            in the end economics is the treatment of money by people, and people are just people. fallen sinners, balding monkeys, anything but omnirational beings. they can reason spending on themselves anything and cutting the power off someone they don‚Äôt like based on whatever. because reason is a lie, for some more than others specially, but divorced from prime mover‚Äôs absolute transcendent truth it can be twisted into anything.which is why economic systems keep changing and theories collapsing, as the material world that money deals with, and the people that deal with money, change. back in Austrian School times, it was assumed people needed to save more, until they didn‚Äôt need to. now it is assumed you need to spend more, until you can‚Äôt afford to. and so on. a change usually takes time to notice, because the economic dance is so global and tumultuously fast now, you can‚Äôt see above it ‚Äì unless a crack eventually happens.

            This is what I think the political class will try to use as last resort to keep the various balls in the air for a while longer.  I don‚Äôt think it will fly though and will trigger the dissolution of the US if nothing has before that.  A lot of people in Red States will clearly see this as a neocon Hail Mary to save Ziomerica and that‚Äôs when the secessions will begin.  Since most of the military personnel and bases are in those states the US may not even be able to mobilize forces for the Great Patriotic War against whatever nation it decides to nominate as the greatest enemy of Freedumb ever.

            the Chinese will certainly think twice about accepting dollars when the joggers invading the Macy‚Äôs at Central Park become recurrent, and when a green-soyfied ultravaccinated West under mask and lockdown every few months (this twice as strong pneumonia for 0.3% of people isn‚Äôt going away) buys less of the oil. after all, the sheikhs also trade in dollars. if they leave and as Eurasia gets taken over by the One Commie Belt or whatever, then it‚Äôs back to selling dollars to the Western Hemisphere‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ except the castizos are less dominant, and the now majority mestizos not as docile or neurotically thrifty as the dwindling Indian, nor as smart or lazy like the castizo, and definitely can be loud and dramatic like the black. ergo the continent is both more consumerist and more violent. yet unlike the castizo, the mestizos have even less affinity with the Anglos, more with blacks and Asians and natives too. besides, economically all these rump nations depend on China now too, as they apparently recognize their lost colonies status. so no chance of trading with Latin America either.and lost colonies we are, yet not only due to our flawed rebellious nature, also because mother Europe is so willingly giving itself away; perhaps not as fast as America in real time, but philosophically its united Christian and white spirit is gone. true, ideally a white defense, customs and trade bloc would be formed. but after all, with whites any attempt at coalition forming is a huge dramatic hassle; in this case it‚Äôs a white survival crisis as epic as the Lord of The Rings, but the fellowship never agreed to be formed in the first place, so there is no trilogy and Mordor wins. specially if the whole thing is infiltrated by (((fellow whites))).i doubt whiter America will be able to form a fellowship as well, so it will split off the globocoasts and turn inward‚Ä¶ until there‚Äôs no redoubt to hide, as castizos are finding out. same for Europe and elsewhere. in short a basket of currencies would be healthier for everyone, it just needn‚Äôt come with the West‚Äôs destruction. in fact, the dollar getting cheaper would benefit local production so much, while it still exists that is.

        Since you bring up quantum physics, a Heisenberg quote:‚ÄùWe can no longer speak of the behaviour of the particle independently of the process of observation. As a final consequence, the natural laws formulated mathematically in quantum theory no longer deal with the elementary particles themselves but with our knowledge of them. Nor is it any longer possible to ask whether or not these particles exist in space and time objectively ‚Ä¶ When we speak of the picture of nature in the exact science of our age, we do not mean a picture of nature so much as apicture of our relationships with nature. ‚Ä¶Science no longer confronts nature as an objective observer, but sees itself as an actor in this interplay between man and nature. The scientific method of analysing, explaining and classifying has become conscious of its limitations, which arise out of the fact that by its intervention science alters and refashions the object of investigation. In other words, method and object can no longer be separated.‚ÄùSo then what would this newmeta-economics look like? Maybe a lot like the current mess.

        The US is in a Depression right now , bread lines well foo bank lines and all. Our press simply doesn‚Äôt cover anything.Its been easy to paper over though with wealth redistribution  and EBT and all that stuff.Frankly the reason no one is protesting on a huge scale , beyond virus fears is why bother? American jobs suck and between unemployment, regulations  and the bonus money, many unemployed people were doing just fine and now have to time to live.Worse do to shit wages large  swathes of the population made near as much on the bonus ($1200 a month tax free) as they would at a job. Other than not getting together with friends there is very little to protest.Now if we fail to manage unemployment and massive numbers of people go homeless and hungry  well things may change.A last note, no there will not be high inflation outside of things that are actually scare and in demand (food and ammo basically) . Inflation requires significant monetary velocity and the velocity of money is now on hold largely for good.This doesn‚Äôt mean there will never be inflation only that the economy has shrunk for good as a lot of ancillary jobs servicing malls, some retail, offices and other things are gone for good.This means unless there is a lot of make work, there won‚Äôt be the same types and level of spending even with an income guarantee.A few large companies produce far lower economic velocity than more smaller ones.

        The answer is there and it‚Äôs not a new one. Why does anybody exchange goods and services for pieces of paper, or even shiny rocks? The answer is the same as it‚Äôs been since there has been money. You accept those bits of shiny rock because of faith. This, however, is the Billy Graham economy, or maybe the Jim Jones economy would be closer to the truth. They are drunk with this new power and intend to push it to the point of failure‚Ä¶.maybe just to find out where exactly that point is.

            Yes, it all comes down to the willingness of the other to exchange with you. And this is equally as true for supposedly valuable things like gold. Yes, it‚Äôs true that it takes 1,10, whatever tons of ore to make just one ounce of gold, but it‚Äôs still just a piece of metal. If no one would accept it in trade for a good or service, it would not be of much use beyond decoration, dental filling, etc. I admit it it kind of useless, but the Kruggerands do make nice coasters üòÄ

        I am old enough to remember when TV economists had economic models, literally. They consisted of coloured liquids flowing through various pipes and valves and into compartments labelled employment, inflation, savings etc. All complete bollocks of course. In fact the older I get the more I am persuaded that not only is economics no science, but simply a collection of ad hoc justifications cooked up by apologists for whatever elites are currently benefiting from the status quo. It‚Äôs interesting that you mention Tesla and it‚Äôs apparent ability to defy the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù of commerce. Tesla and electric vehicles more generally seem to be another of those Liberal Goodwhite cults that we see all around today. If you go on youtube and type tesla in the search box you get a multitude of channels generally fronted by rather effete young men literally drooling over the high priest‚Äôs latest pronouncements. All rather disturbing in my view.

            Tesla (the man) was a fascinating figure. You can read his bio, probably on Wiki. Early radio and electrical pioneer. Created a small earthquake. Could transmit electricity wirelessly over large distances. Basically invented AC electricity. A man named Westinghouse made Tesla very wealthy as a result. Nonetheless, Telsa died in obscure poverty.[Insert optional ‚ÄúHe was working on a interdimensional space-time portal at the time of his death. US government confiscated all his notes.‚Äù which may or may not be true, but adds spice to story.]At least he has a physical unit named in his honor.I post all that because, do you wonder if the toy car company that now bears his name, wil come to a simialr sad end?

Amazingly, the woke left recently threw Hamilton overboard because its underlying message was too civic nationalist.
Predictably, conservatives who had previously criticized the musical for its degeneracy are now rushing to defend it.

        A plea for help. Not completely off topic.I intend to try to teach kids informal logic and ‚Äúhow to think‚Äù next year as the Dioceses wants to give us more time in English and Math this year to make up for the situation in last trimester of last year. (distance learning)I want to use a book called ‚ÄúThe Fallacy Detective‚Äù which will help them learn the errors in logic. (straw man, red herring, and so on)But I also want to use ‚ÄúEconomics in One Lesson‚Äù by Henry Hazlitt. The book is loosely Austrian and so covers Praxeology in its own fashion. This could be a bridge too far. Maybe use only a few of the easier sections.(I would love to use Mises ‚ÄúHuman Action‚Äù but I would need 3 years to do that.)So question; what suggestions would you give to work with middle school age kids. I did formal logic with high school kids some years ago but they were so much more mature. Any comments?

                I do think we can use some of it. The broken window fallacy can be understood by anyone with an open mind. Some of it is too much for the age group ‚Äî I have to judge that part.Just the first page where he tells us that the following spawns new fallacies every day:the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.We could talk in terms of school rules, coaches methods in soccer, or kid‚Äôs and their chores. There are ways to talk to kids about even very important things. (plus we try to us humor whenever possible)I do appreciate you comment though. The book is not an easy read for kids I‚Äôll grant.

        First, I agree ‚Äì no one at our level knows what is going on. However, it is quite clear, exactly as pointed out, that the effect of the creation of the transaction, capital economy funnels (nearly) all the newly created wealth towards our overlords. I have an interest in economics, and the way I think of the debt is that all the newly created money is exactly that ‚Äì money. The big boys at top orient their businesses to capturing as much of that newly created money in order to increase their ownership of the total available money pool. And, I believe it is fair to say we see the results ‚Äì the middle class getting the last nail in the coffin because our wages and valuation will never keep up. This allows further centralization of wealth through inflation. To wit: if I have a penny and the world only has one dollar, then I have 1/100 of the worlds wealth, and am rich. If there is 10000000000 dollars, and I have a penny, I am a pauper. The money printing allows this distribution to become increasingly unidirectional.However, this leads to my next point. Z muses on the way this debt should be unsustainable. I would argue that, through chicanery, the stock market prices are being buoyed not only for the rich to cash out, but also keep the bonds and funds that fuel pensions and superficial monetary systems afloat for as long as possible while the redistribution continues. So much of their psychological and monetary policy is, at least superficially, directed towards keeping the middle class slowly dying but not exploding. The old adage about boiling a frog slowly comes to mind.Ultimately, I feel that, after enough of this has gone on for long enough, and the middle class is gone by ‚Äúoutside forces‚Äù (lost their homes through foreclosure (the virus!), no sense of safety (those teens!) their pensions don‚Äôt pay nearly enough (inflation!), can‚Äôt find a job (the economy!), don‚Äôt have any hope (netflix and pills!)), TPTB can propose a new solution to the lethargic economy experienced by the average person ‚Äì Basket Currency/SDR/ Universal Currency. In the same way it took the Great Depression to usher in Bretton Woods and the New World Order, the lower classes will be so powerless, so aimless, and so hopeless, they would have no real interest in whether their monthly stiped is on a debit card from US gub or World Bank.

I‚Äôm a little down on Anglin at the moment, as he‚Äôs gone full Schiff on the economic stuff.  He threw a crybaby meltdown when one of the posters on his message board mildly and respectfully challenged him on it a couple of days ago.
Counter Currents serves its purpose.  I click it daily but don‚Äôt necessarily read it daily.

        Wow long post today üôÇ Some thoughts:‚Äúthe modern economy we see things that should not be happening.‚Äù Actually, the things you cite are perfectly reasonable, given the enormous money giveaway in progress: the Lion‚Äôs share to the wealthy corporations, the crumbs (stimulus checks + unemployment better than your prior wages) for the dirt people. Absent the largesse of Uncle Sugar, yes we would in all likelihood have seen a stock crash on par with 1929‚Äôs, rioting or at least tent cities with massive unemployment as well as classical economics working as it should. People often forget to consider the government intervention as one of the factors. Indeed, it often is the strongest factor, especially with macro interventions like creating liquidity/debt/money/whatever.As I partially explain above, the USA is exceptional in many ways. Not the least is that we are the ‚Äúreserve currency‚Äù and that has let us get away with a lot of bad behavior for generations. Classical economics says it must end someday, and can in most general terms describe the ruin afterwards, but of course it can‚Äôt predict ‚Äúwhen‚Äù. The stock market, and the economy is general, are just riding the continuous heroin high from all the stimulus. Reality? Not welcome at this time, but it‚Äôll be back with the SWAT team üòÄAs a wise economic writer once said, if the printing press or whatever fashionable ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù view was then in vogue, had been the solution to a government‚Äôs financial problems, whether ancient Rome, or France of the 18th century, or Weimar Germany, or the Soviet Union, indeed any country that ever tried it, that country and its government would still be a going concern. We in the USA, and other countries operating by the same ‚Äúrules‚Äù, only seem to be an exception to history‚Äôs judgment. That‚Äôs only because¬†everything is working fine ‚Äî for now. We pat ourselves on the back, and perhaps think that finally, all those Harvard economists have gotten capitalism under control and they only work for the highest and best good, pulling those levers and turning the dials at the FED or in New York or wherever they do it.¬†To make an imperfect analogy, we are wishing for man‚Äôs genius, sort of like the millions of Chinese peasants who live downriver from the Three Gorges Dam rely on the ingenuity and integrity of those who built and operate the dam.More transactions = more commissions for somebody.‚Äú‚Ä¶the robots will reach a point where they know the market value of all items before the market is set. No robot will be able to fool the other robots.‚Äù Disagree. This may not be what you were arguing, but your claim appears to assume that the market is not subject to manipulation. Ha! No such market ever existed. Of course, subject to whatever enforcement mechanisms shall be in place, the cynic still expects that human nature, one feature of which is to try and twist things to one‚Äôs own advantages, will find cunning ways for his robot to do the same.I know Z is a fan of Asimov‚Äôs Foundation trilogy. Actually, the ‚ÄúTrilogy‚Äù has grown to triple that or so. When you have a marketable idea, both original author or posthumous collaborators, can continue the series. They did a pretty good job, too. Why a book review now? Because Z has mentioned The Mule, a disruptor who appears in part of the saga. He is a human mutant, with mental powers (charisma) that can influence nearly all people to do his will. As a result, he does quite well being a despot üòÄ I bring up Foundation here, because in the last few novels, the robots are revealed to have been splitting into multiple factions over time, due to disagreements, and ways to get around, the original Three Laws of Robotics. There end up being at least four warring groups, all because they adopted additional interpretations of how they were to serve Man. Perhaps this wasn‚Äôt a good analogy. In Foundation all robots are sentient beings, effectively Man‚Äôs equal cognitively. In the real world, AI is still far from that; no matter, machines can do some impressive things, but they can also do some horrid damage. They are not conscious. They can‚Äôt make moral decisions. AS some wise ass said, early in the days of computing, ‚ÄúA man with a computer can make the same mistake that would have taken a team of mathematicians working with adding machines ten thousand years to make.‚Äù Garbage in, garbage out. Returning (ahem) to the magic money spigot, it‚Äôs all fun and games until a day comes when, for some inexplicable reason, nobody wants to accept the money anymore. That is the end game.‚ÄúQuantum economics?‚Äù This would explain why the cash in my wallet magically vanished when it was in the property room during a few hours I spent in jail.¬†Clearly, the currency spontaneously jumped to a higher energy state or whatever it‚Äôs supposed to do. üòÄWhenever you hear the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù applied to ‚Äúeconomics‚Äù beware. Certainly, it‚Äôs a valid field of inquiry, but a ‚Äúscience?‚Äù In the sense of mathematics, physics or even medicine? No way. At best, a ‚Äúsoft science.‚Äù Really? The economic choices of millions of human beings, reduced to¬†a few high-school level algebra equations? And this has descriptive or better, predictive power? Perhaps only in the most vague terms. But to think you can rely upon the arcane theories, often having little clear resemblance to observed reality, no way. That‚Äôs as fanciful as Foundation protagonist Dr. Hari Seldon‚Äôs psychohistory, which claimed to map the Galaxy‚Äôs political fortunes far into the future. Finally, keep in mind Asimov‚Äôs world is a fictional universe. Federal Reserve &amp; Co. probably operate, at least partially, in a make-believe fantasy land, but their actions eventually have real-world consequences.‚ÄúMyth‚Äù is another word that should be rehabilitated. Most myths have some, sometimes a lot, of truth behind them. They can even be useful for teaching folklore, history, etc. It‚Äôs helpful at some point to know what was true and what was false.If Roger Daltrey were here, he‚Äôd tell you that he won‚Äôt get fooled again, loose a primal scream, and then say meet the new boss, same as the old boss. üòÄ

            Yes, it is much worse for them. Patreon has no reason to settle now, so they will proceed with arbitration. Since the claimants do not have an actual claim, it is hard to see how they prevail. Depending upon how that plays out, it could lead to further litigation against the claimants in California court.

                How do you see that the claimants don‚Äôt have a claim?On theories of contractual interference and violation of the implied covenant of good faith &amp; fair dealing in the contract, they have good arguments, as well as the argument that Patreon unconscionably and in violation of public policy unilaterally altered contract terms where neither the creator or consumers had meaningful bargaining power/opportunity.  They could even smuggle a California Constitution/First Amendment angle in by claiming Patreon‚Äôs actions violate public policy.  I haven‚Äôt actually seen the complaint, just spitballing what I would plead in their shoes.There‚Äôs always the chance that it turns into a cui bono decision rather than being judged on the actual merits but that‚Äôs a different argument.  This does involve issues including a conflict between CA and SCROTUS over the Federal Arbitration Act (abusing arbitration clauses to frustrate consumer class actions, among other things) and the Ninth Circuit and SCROTUS may get a badfinger in here, but that doesn‚Äôt reflect on the merits of these cases.

                    The claimants did not have a contract with Owen Benjamin. Nothing Patreon did prevented any of these people from sending Benjamin a check. The three legs of a civil claim are 1) the claimant has been harmed, 2) the court can remedy the harm and 3) the the respondent is responsible for the harm. Patreon may have hurt these people‚Äôs feelings, but they have no claim the arbitrator can remedy.The thing about arbitration is it is not the place for novel or clever legal arguments. The arbitrator is there to get the facts and come up with an equitable settlement. In short order he is going to see that these claims were part of a scheme to shake down Patreon. Maybe the claimants have something more than has been revealed thus far, but it seems unlikely.

                        From what I understand they were never there to shakedown Patreon. They filed the suits because they wanted to cost Patreon a lot of money to live up to their contractual obligations. Owen Benjamin did ask for a certain amount of money to make it all go away, but there is no evidence he could since the cases are all individual cases of arbitration. The process is the punishment.

                            Then your understanding is faulty. If you look at the court filings, Benjamin‚Äôs attorney claimed to be representing the claimants and offered to abandon the arbitration claims if they gave Benjamin 2.5 million. The arbitrator will see that for what it is.This was my point when this started. Arbitration is a process, just like everything else in the law. Unlike a courtroom, the arbitrator is free to explore the claims of both parties. He‚Äôs going to want to know why 72 people in different states filed the exact same arbitration claim. He‚Äôll note that the claimants have no actual claim. He‚Äôs going to dig into it, as I would expect Patreon to have filed their own claim in this process.The thing is, we will have no way of knowing what has happened. The usual grifters will be out lying about everything, because that‚Äôs what they do, but JAMS does not make anything public. What we do know is at the end of arbitration there is an award letter. If the claimants do not post one of those on-line, then we know they lost. Similarly, if we don‚Äôt see a commencement letter, then we know the process ended before it began, either by agreement or JAMS terminated the process. Nothing prevents the parties from posting those documents on-line.

                                You‚Äôre right, and I have not read the filing. I also don‚Äôt know what powers JAMS has to award Patreon a settlement in this case for their arbitration fees. The way corporate American has been banding together I imagine JAMS will waive or reduce their arbitration fees significantly, and thus the whole thing will be a moot point.

Patreon can‚Äôt be taking a slice of the subscribers‚Äô cash by middle-manning the service and claim with a straight face that they have no privity or duty to the subs.
As for arbitration not being a place for novel arguments, take a look at case law re: confirmation or modification/set asides of consumer awards in California.
Did the subs ask for injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits or relief outside of $$$ damages?  Any of that would be available under CA unfair competition laws.

                            Having been in arbitration more than a few times, I know the first thing the the arbitrator will dispense with is clever legal arguments. The claimants will need to express clearly and simply how they were harmed, the amount of the harm in dollars and how Patreon is responsible for that harm. On the face of it, I can‚Äôt see how they were harmed. They could send Benjamin a check, a money order, cash. Patreon is a service for the convenience of Benjamin, not his fans. My understanding is they charge him the processing fees.All we actually know is what was posted on the California State Court website, so maybe there is a lot more going on here that has been revealed. My reading of the docs says they have not proceeded very far in the arbitration process. JAMS told Patreon there was enough to begin the process and Patreon then filed in state court. I would assume Patreon next asks for consolidation of the claims, since they are identical and have the same attorney. This will reduce time and costs. After that you get a hearing and then the commencement of arbitration.The thing is, this will not amount to anything. Patreon may get tagged with a bunch of costs, but they will change their terms of service and this door shuts forever. Alternatively, they prevail in arbitration and show this was a frivolous use of the arbitration system in order to facilitate an shakedown for Owen Benjamin. Patreon then goes into a real court to recover their costs from Benjamin.That‚Äôs the thing with arbitration. It is informal and the arbitrators are usually retired judges. They really believe in the system and they are not passive. They don‚Äôt take any bullshit either. I was a witness in a proceeding years ago. I thought it was going to be a few hours of my time and that would be it. I spent all day answering questions from the arbitrator. It became obvious he did not believe any of the participants. I don‚Äôt know how it ended, but none of the parties contacted me again, so I assume not well.

                From what I gather the larger point is not to ‚Äòbeat‚Äô Patreon but to make the cost of censorship dear so that companies don‚Äôt take it lightly.
Like fighting a bully, win or lose, the real victory is making him think twice from then on.

        All of the paradoxes you mention are explained by a couple of things.


First. National deficit spending is now backdoor money creation. So every scenario based on the idea that the money must or even should be repaid is obsolete.


Second. The threat of financing government via seigniorage has always been inflation. Which is not a factor yet because of the inherent deflationary pressure of industrialization and globalization.


So where does the new money go if it‚Äôs not bidding up labor and consumables? Chasing assets ofgois why we see preposterous valuations for stocks and real estate.

            Yes, I have seen the same argument for gold and (I guess) other valuables. I have no great investing advice, nor a lot of assets.
