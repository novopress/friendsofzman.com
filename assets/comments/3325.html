        I think the country is at a tipping point on so many issues. People are fed up with the constant Leftist antics. Identity politics are contributing heavily to dividing the country and those of us who can see the destruction it’s caused are at the very least, disgusted.

        I have to laugh how Steve Sailer is pounding his shoe on the desk demanding everyone credit him with exposing this hoax:http://www.unz.com/isteve/how-skepticism-spread-about-the-rolling-stone-rape-story/
