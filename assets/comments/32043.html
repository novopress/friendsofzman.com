        A couple of weeks ago on my daily long bike ride, I rode past a group of 8 or 9 kids playing football in a park without adult supervision.  The first thought I had was, “that’s strange.”  I even told my wife what I saw when I got home.  What used to be normal and healthy is now weird.

            Yes, in my day we were “free range” kids…no helicopter parenting, mom didn’t care what we did, we only showed up at home for meals or a special TV show…Street games everywhere…

                To be fair, there really wasn’t much to do at home.  The Gen-Y and Z kids had a lot more to occupy their attention and time in the 90s and later.   A lot of these kids then and now prefer to be home.

                    We moved to a ranch after 3rd grade, but when we still lived in town, there was always some neighbor tossing out an old lawnmower, which meant one of us was getting a new go-cart as soon as we rebuilt the engine and scrounged up some parts. Dad tolerated the loss of one stall of the garage, as there were always some neighbor kids wrenching in there.

                In those days, America was 90% white and the most you had to worry about is some creepy old guy in a car offering your kid candy. You didn’t have drive-bys or people “cutting” your kid as an “occupational” hazard of just being out and about your lilly white neighborhood. Then came ……….. diversity.

            Isn’t it even more strange that the cult of child safety is so strong among women who won’t even raise their children themselves.

                Not really. People tend to treat the firstborn as if he is fragile as fine crystal, and by the second or third, come to the realization kids are made of titanium. Physically, at least.

                        The same, only different… I am the youngest of four boys, who were born respectively in 1944, 1948, 1954 and 1960. Not only did we seem to have different parents (who happened to be the same people), we thought we belonged to different pop culture eras. If you look at our graduation pictures it is a simple exercise to place them in correct chronological order, and probably guess what music each of us listened to, just by the hair.That said, we all had one thing going for us – no helicopter parenting. The rules were simple: Don’t get into trouble, and be at the table at six. And now that we are all old (63 to 80), our common inheritance stands out more clearly, against the dreadful backdrop of Current Year insanity.

                Thanks to diversity, you can’t just let your kids run off and play unsupervised anymore.  It legitimately is not responsible in most places.

                    That’s not really true.  There are plenty of kids playing at home in their 700k Dollar house in the suburbs with no diversity.

                        The example given in the first comment is neighborhood kids playing football in a public park.  You can’t just let your kids go do that unsupervised anymore in 90% of the country.  This isn’t about kids playing in their yards in upscale suburbs.

                            This argument grates on me.  It’s a corollary to “doing the jobs Americans won’t do.” To the extent that either of these two claims are true, it’s because we’ve both encouraged them and unquestioningly accepted their veracity.
Covid laid bare how much of our fear of everyday life is little more than allowing pussies to run our lives.

                            I don’t think it’s quite that bad. 90 percent is too high. But, yes, if you live in a major city, an inner burb or most places in the south, dieversity is a serious threat to your kid’s wellbeing.

                                meh, there was just as much diversity in the south when I was growing up as there is now and it was ok to go outside and play back then, I am pretty sure it still is now, people are just scared by the teeveeAlthough I should note, in our legally captured world, if anything at all does happen to your child while they’re out there playing unsupervised, you risk CPS taking your kids away from you for being unfit. Some karen nurse down at the hospital will be more than happy to report you. That’s the greater danger nowadays, not “predators.”

                                    This. For example, in 1973 one of our middle school classmates, walking to the evening roller skating party at the school gym, took a shortcut over the frozen local creek, went through a soft spot in the ice, and drowned. Her body was recovered the next day some distance downstream. A real tragedy, with all kinds of support and sympathy extended to the bereaved.
Today, the result would be “community outrage” and the parents would have their lives ruined by an army of on-line Karens. It was a different time, you understand…

                            It is nowhere near 90% It is largely in the big cities and the closest suburbs, especially if there is a bus that goes from the inner city to the suburb. Certain “diverse” people get along fine with whites, particularly as prepubescent children.Kids can walk around doing basically nothing or they can invite their friend over to play playstation all day.The suburbs absolutely suck for kids. This is the fault of “diversity” Everything is far away and there are no buses and the roads are unsuitable for kids walking/biking on them. They’re narrow with no walkways. Plus the population density and the far smaller family size play a role too. There must have been 15 kids within a year or 2 of my age on my block in the city. Lots of stuff well within walking distance. The park can be 5 miles away in the burbs. The playground and a park were a few blocks from my house. The park was exceptionally large besides. There were several movie theaters well within biking distance. In the summer, during the week during the day, they were only like 2 bucks (this was the late 70s)Plus, just being outside was the norm. Monkey see, monkey do. Everyone else is outside and so you go outside. Now that is working against kids. Everyone is inside and so why go outside? At best, you walk over to your friend’s house and play games.

                                One thing Philly got absolutely right is parks. When I lived there, I’d go to Wissahickon Valley for legit hikes in the woods— within city limits. Almost 20 years since, but it was safe in my experience.

                                    Yes. There are parks all over the city, some are proper woods complete with a creek you can go fishing in.  Plus a lot of other lesser parks.  Lots of playgrounds too.  Though my parents would usually put up an above ground pool, the city pools were great too.  The East and West river drives are pretty good too.I used to work just outside the city that was very close to Wissahickon. It’s one of the nicest ones in the city. They have covered bridges going over the creek a nice wide paved trail and a restaurant in the middle of the park.  I used to like to walk through the park on my lunch hour.

                    This is probably at least as big a part of it as the proliferation of digital entertainment. People who wax poetic about being outside from dawn til dusk overlap very strongly with people who were children when the US was 90% white and the diversity was kept largely separate.

                        You didn’t grow up in the South, did you? Most parts of town the diversity was only a street or two away. That’s why Brown happened in the South — segregated schools meant the diversity was not permitted to attend the school in their neighborhood, but had to go to the black school, however far that was.
It’s not that they were kept separate (though they were in the North) but that they were kept in check by penalties severe enough, even if/though those penalties were harsher than those for whites. Largely because whites didn’t need severe penalties to behave.

                            Social norms are a form of keeping them separate obviously. They may have been in relative physical proximity, but they were also aware of the hammer that would come down on them if they strayed into places where they shouldn’t be.
These days the law is more likely to come down on the person defending themselves from vibrant aggression than it is to come down on the aggressor.

                            Back when whites still had their balls, negro transgressions against whites–particularly women–could receive terminal vigilante justice. That’s the way it should be because that’s the only way to defend whites from boons. If a nuggra buck knew he might get strung up at sundown, he’d be far less inclined to cop a feel (or worse) on a white girl in the drug store.

                    Depends upon the neighborhood I suspect.Story. Son’s first home after marriage was in a single family residential *Mormon* neighborhood. After a few years and a young daughter being born, he is surprised one day when a small 5-6 yo girl knocks on the door. Girl ask’s if he has a daughter. He says yes, why? Girl says she was told there was a young girl a couple blocks over that she might like to play with.This Mormon girl was directed to their house by parents he had never met. Wow? Not just the trust involved, but the nature of the girl (traveling a couple blocks to find their house) and her lack of shyness to address total strangers. Anyway, introductions were made, the girl was over for a few hours and at dinner time was escorted back home by son—who then met parents.When told this story by son—who was still incredulous—I simply responded, “That’s the way the world was when I grew up.” I left the matter for him to figure out—I can only hope he has a small inkling of what we’ve lost as a (dieverse) society.

        It’s a weird situation now with the elite selection pressure for feminized cyberspace boys. Yet their playground depends entirely on a very real infrastructure that only exists in meat space. One thing I’ve noticed is the sharp decline in real computer skills in the younger generation. Some of these kids don’t even know what a file system is, since the so-called smart phones hide that from the average user.The original Internet was built by men with practical skill and knowhow. The first computers were also far less user friendly. We should have gatekept computers and the Internet and shot Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and all the other bastards who made the digital world easy for the midwits and other idiots to use.

                    I often wonder about stick shifts myself being as dead as the dino’s.  I loved mine and insisted having it in any sport vehicle.  But they are gone. Why? The fact is that the modern automatic transmission outperforms the human with stick shift—both in fuel efficiency and acceleration performance.  EV’s are even better, assuming you don’t run out of electrons.

                            I drive a Honda Accord, 6 speed, ~250 k miles.  I get all the efficiency, etc., but even as reflexive as shifting is, I think I still pay better attention to around town driving – which is what it’s used for – as I have to at least think a bit about up shifting and down shifting.

        A problem with the digital-transistor age is that it aids, abets, and magnifies some of the worst behavior of children in schools. It was always bad enough that the K through 12 system trapped large numbers of kids with their equally ignorant and immature peers. I think it wasJohn Taylor Gatto, a former teacher, who explored this in at least one of his books attacking modern education. (The Underground History…,iirc) Now the kids can indulge in petty gossip, rumor spreading, backbiting, and whatnot at any hour of the day. Their comments and memes move very fast, much fast than under the old system of word of mouth and insults scrawled on restroom walls and stalls.What makes the social media thing even worse is that bad kids can carry on adolescent behavior easily long after leaving high school. The tech titans and their regime sponsors are perfecting the collectivist school system of arresting development, maintaining that retardation until people are past middle age, and lifting the worst into positions of social and political power

            Drive by – an astute observation.  I’m from an age when surreptitiously passing notes in class scrawled on a piece of notebook paper was madcap.  The risk of a teacher intercepting said note could be daunting.  I must assume all that to be highly antiquated.

            Society has not come to grips with the price we, and especially our children pay for “smart phones.”
It remains to be seen if this new normal can last normal economic conditions, assuming they ever return.  All of social media has only existed in a bubble.  I’m not sure it is clear that they would survive normal economic conditions where losing money 10 years in a row is “normal.”

Leno said he was not a business tycoon, but he didn’t see how Amazon was on track for great things in the future. Leno laughed, Bezos laughed. You all know the rest of the story.

Yes, they can make incredible programs and develop hardware to do amazing stuff, but this often comes at the expense of a viable world model of how functional societies operate and will potentially counter them. They’ll have fun with their joysticks and screens for a while but will be paralyzed when cheap counters to their toys are introduced.

            Thus Tom A’s incessant advice to stay in the shadows, attract no notice, and commit to discipline and preparation. The honesty, hard work and thrift must remain hidden. The marauders want all of it – our money, our property, our children, our very souls. We must never forget that we live in an occupied country, ruled by enemies who revile us. We are in for a tough ride, better get used to it.

                    Fuentes has his fans and also has his detractors, but he’s more well-known now than he was prior to the Kanye J-naming thing.

                    He was just given an extra five minutes, at least when queer porn was streamed from his site. Probably it was a hack conceived by people who aren’t as bright as they believe that they are.The JPost published some detailsabout the incident, because they need to remind their own supremacist base that they are innocent objects of bigotry. Now EMJ has a news peg on which to hang another reminder aboutJews broadcasting porn at the Palestinians from Pali TV stations. And if EMJ doesn’t do so, someone else will. Heh.

                I participate on a message board for fans of the band Phish. Discussion topics go far beyond that band, any subject is game — other bands, movies, anything political, etc. There is presently a thread about Nick F. with over a hundred comments. Ergo, it appears that awareness of him has broken out of the DR subculture into a larger realm.

                Fuentes is a young man (25?) and has a big following among the young folks. He’s a vocal critic of Israel and the J’s vast influence and power. He had been banned from Twitter and recently, as of two or three weeks ago, reinstated. He now has over 300,000 followers already.He also loudly advocates for Christian Nationalism with his “Christ is King” declarations, along with his support for traditionalism.Some people hate him, some love him, but it can’t be denied that he’s talented. He’s especially great at debating, one of the best I’ve seen. In addition to his recall of facts and smooth verbal delivery, he has a way of getting under his opponent’s skin, frustrating him, and doing it with a mischievous grin, like he’s having fun.  That’s very appealing to a lot of young people compared to the serious, stodgy manner of so many others.He’s also always pushing for a chance to debate Ben Shapiro, which would be fun to see. Shapiro, wisely, would never agree to that.

He’s been around for a long time — we used to read his stuff in grad school in the mid-1990s. He’s a 1970 West Point grad so he’s not exactly an academic shitlib.He’s one of the most influential members of the so-called “realist” school of Great Power politics, in contradistinction to the Wilsonian/international “liberal”/interdependence school. To a large extent it’s based on observations made by Thucydides 2500 years ago — that there is no enforceable morality in international politics, that states interact in a condition of global anarchy, and that states always pursue their own self-interest.He was utterly confounded by the latter point with regard to the U.S.-Israel relationship. He observed that the U.S. actually pursued policies antithetical to is own interests in order to satisfy the Israel Lobby. He wrote a paper and then a book called “The Israel Lobby” around 2005 or so.He’s proven himself to be correct far more often than your typical academic.

                    “He wrote a paper and then a book called “The Israel Lobby” around 2005 or so.”The article was commissioned by “The Atlantic” — which then refused to publish it. It got published by the “London Review of Books” in England. Then an attempt was made to sully the reputation of the authors — both of them distinguished academics. For example they got invited to a television interview but unbeknownst to them, David Duke got invited as well. The intention was to associate these two with Duke, and thus arouse suspicions about them being “anti-semitic.” There was no serious discussion of their main contention — that the US is acting against its own vital interests by supporting and propping up Israel.

                Mearsheimer has a number of video interviews on YouTube.  Search his name.  He was, as Z-man was, pretty spot on wrt Ukraine and Russia conflict.  If you hit a YT interview, give the guy 10 minutes.  If not impressed move on.  I find him a voice of reason.  As Z-man noted, he’s of another—and better—world.

                    Plus he does it not being a Russian shill.  He still takes an American view, while acknowledging reality.  He has been very good on the war.  Ritter became ever more unhinged after his interview show stopped.  The Duran are just shills and frankly, grifters.  VOR used to be better, but now he just says things because he likes to hear himself speak.

Elite culture, however, no longer selects for the traits learned in these areas. Instead, it is the traits acquired on the digital playground that offer the pathway to the higher reaches. By the standards of the digital age, Nick Fuentes is the quintessential digital man.
So elite culture has settled on Nick Fuentes as their guy?

        Not only are the skills from the gymnasium and the library falling in status, but the playground skills have changed as well.Your analysis is very interesting, but I’m not certain it is entirely accurate. Rather than the playground subsuming the gymnasium and library, it seems they have all merged into one indistinguishable mass. What passes for competition and education now is attained on the playground. This may account for why the playground seems to have changed so much since it too no longer is separate from the other arenas. All three legs of the stool are worse off as a result.There were solid reasons successful societies segregated all these activities and sought to attain the best from each. Blending the components together diminishes all three necessary ingredients, and the end result is anti-human and ultimately leads to failure. The Napoleonic Wars were won in the gymnasium, library and the playground of Eaton. The very idea that a single component let alone some hybrid of the three laid the groundwork for victory is absurd.If our tribe is to return in full, it will need to remember it has to be excellent in gymnasiums, libraries and playgrounds that are distinctive from one another. Looking around the globe, others still seem to appreciate this reality.

            Jack:  All good points.  And I would also argue that feminism has had a greater hand in what’s happened in each group than Zman credits. Nothing but female writers, editors, and librarians controlling the flow of information.  Women endlessly pushing themselves into men’s physical space, like the female ‘sports’reporters, and the banning of dodge ball as not nice.  And don’t get me started on the playground – the endless female teachers’ rules on what is/is not ‘safe,’ what games are ‘inclusive’ enough and what imaginative play is too ‘violent.’  I’m so glad my young grandson goes to the park almost daily, to climb and run around like a normal boy.

        Sometimes I really grok the idea that English Colonists really did an injustice to the American Indians.  Not because the Indians were remotely like Rouseau’s “noble savages”, but because Man naturally wants to live in a smallish kin tribe, hunt buffalo with his hands in the great outdoors, and die in battle before 50.
All technology, its’s maintenance, and it consequences exponentially complicates things and ultimately makes everybody crazy, fake, and gay.  At least that’s what Uncle Ted said!

            Contemporary society is indeed anti-human. There probably is no other way for eight billion and counting to inhabit the same planet, so for all the wrong reasons the WEF is right to some extent there. Rethinking and reshaping society away from the current model would be a worthy goal but likely impossible. Urbanization initially was a positive but in rather short order crushed the human spirit and soul. Like diversity itself, the nice/different restaurants were not worth the trade-off.

                They’ve got the right idea, but their proposals are terrible. Which makes sense because they got there creating all these problems.
What’s strange about this time is that there’s no alternative elite to replace them. Seems to me things keep getting worse, until they collapse.

        I agree with much of Z’s thoughts here except for the swipe at Fuentes at the end. Nick is not in the same league of power and responsibility as people like Blinken. He’s just a Millennial internet commentator.I’ve watched a few of his videos and I find him to be glib, intelligent, educated and knowledgeable. He states rather plain truths about who runs the U.S. and whose interests it serves. And it’s not white, Christian Americans. His commentary is rather refreshing. I don’t know anything about his “Groypers” or anything about him personally. Is he gay? Ehhh.. ya never know!But I’d rather listen to him then NPR or Meet the Press.Not sure exactly why Z seems to dislike him so.

        And the seminal question is . . . can digital man keep the plates spinning? The answer should be obvious. Hell NO. We are still running on the momentum of our predecessors, and faking competence while printing fake money. That bubble will burst. The dominoes are . . . Russia beats NATO in Ukraine, BRICS kills the dominance of the dollar and Euro, the debt bomb begets a deep worldwide depression, civil unrest explodes, mutual slaughter ensues; which enables a jackboot crackdown and imposition of techno-tyranny.Alternately, and less harmfully, antibodies arise in the fog of chaos and do the natural thing.

        “By comparison, Anthony Blinken and Victoria Nuland come off as dull and confused.”These two belong to the Tribe and so I’m not sure they’re the best examples. Among the Tribe, tribal allegiance trumps merit. As socially, financially, and politically the upper echelons have a disproportionate number of Jews and since they favor one another, one would expect mediocrities to climb to stations they’re demonstrably unfit for.As for Mearsheimer, he’s a scholar. Generally the secretary of state and other senior State Department officials have not been scholars and intellectuals (unless you want to count the drab and mediocre Kissinger as one). Though come to think of it, I suppose George Kennan would qualify — one exception that proves the general rule.

        I have to disagree slightly. I think it is more an issue with managerial class dynamics selecting for this type of individual and technology simply made it easier for all to imitate and model what is being selected for.Social media doesn’t explain why 95% of all the director level and above people at the multiple companies in different regions I’ve met are all the same type of person. Most of whom are far older than I and can barely operate their company laptop effectively.I’ve worked with some real turds that should have been run out of town on a rail, who constantly muck things up, but never really seem to get fired. They’ll fade away for a bit, but end up at another company with same or better position.The switch between action &amp; results vs. feelings &amp; conformity happened before we could tweet about it.

        &gt;The oligarchs that rose up out of Silicon Valley are a different breed of oligarch from those who rose up in the last decades of the industrial revolution. The latter were the product of an American empire on the rise while the former were the product of an empire at its peak.There was a funny meme where it was argued the jocks were the tragic heroes in Revenge of the Nerds, and one can’t help but think this is in fact true.Silicon Valley has become a vast alien realm in just about every way. Regular people got a glimpse into it when Twitter was under Jack’s control and got regular boosted articles about men chest-feeding and the latest gender identity. As we get into more lurid detail about the polycules, the strange drug parties, and the ruthless enforcement of strange social customs, it’s clear people in this bubble simply thought this was normal stuff.Elite subculture has always has it’s weirdness, but they were still able to create offspring, while the current culture is one of the biggest IQ shredders in history. Online culture at large is the same phenomena. There’s no way it can last longer than a generation, which leads to the question of whether the jocks and intellectuals gain ascendance through simply breeding in the next generation.

                Don’t know who “they” are in SA—perhaps you mean disingenuous Whites outside of SA—but I doubt any White in SA is enamored of “diversity”.  Indeed, even the SA *Black* mid level managers I read are not happy with the discriminatory laws involving White employment—seems there are quotas of the number of Whites in any employment sector and especially positions of authority/management.  This seems the bane of the Black directors and such who cannot get the job done with Black workers.  Who’d have thunk?   😉

                        Do they still live in SA, or are expat’s like Musk?  But I admit to only knowing one SA and have never spoke politics with him.  However, I’d be amazed given the recorded speeches of politicians I’ve heard wrt their “White” problem and the blatantly open threats of genocide. Love to hear how they cover such up.  What’s the ratio of Blacks to Whites now, 12 to one?

                            Most of them are still there. I didn’t exactly take this “poll” yesterday, it’s not the most current thing. But it’s the best I have.
Like the AINO shitlib, they get very frustrated about the crime without being willing to recognize the real problem. Same blindness.

                                You are correct. I was born there in the Good Old Before Times and still follow some FB (I know) nostalgia groups. They are at least 50% cucked Whites still residing there and bemoaning the decay, degradation, and danger.
But most of them will blame it on ‘ANC Corruption’ and don’t dare go anywhere near the Genetic stuff. The number of Whites who will pounce on any White commenter who dares even raise a whisper (milquetoast enough to survive FB and moderator censorship) is of course huge and depressing.

                                    Then perhaps they will serve as a good example of a bad example, when the genocide of Whites falls upon them.  The Africans they surround themselves with will be the first to pick up arms to eliminate them.  With nothing but small arms against a seething hoard, I don’t hold out much hope.
Think this is just crazy s**t, just remember any number of the other massacres like in Rwanda that Africa is known for.

        The local high school is experiencing discord and ructions due to hiring a black teacher and a black superintendent, who of course are both incompetent and filled with anti-white grievance.  Reading the reporting on the drama it is notable how many folks are getting into hot water for things they are posting in on-line slap-fights.
It is apparently the way educators and school administrators conduct their affairs nowadays.
[What warms my heart is that the students are getting a real-life lesson in the benefits and joys of diversity].

        This fine essay addresses how men were selected in the technological age of the recent past, but men are now being selected less and less. The nerds rule now, but that is fleeting.  However, the ability of women (however selected) to head up a tech enterprise remains in doubt. Or really any large enterprise not built by a man who preceded her. Fashion design excepted. Put too many of them in positions of power and you get the Real Housewives of Capitol Hill. Bing search “successful female entrepeneur” and they’ll give you a rather unimpressive top 20. But they are being handed the keys nonetheless.   So I’d say the video games are now less of a selection mechanism, and more of a way to keep the white males occupied while the girl bosses “run” things. Idiocracy beckons.And I gotta admit, the video games nowadays are so good that it’s hard to blame the folks who go in and don’t come back out. It’s nothing like the Space Invaders of my day. Whole universes in there.

            To observe that video games today are better than those of yore is like stating that jerking off to 3D visual porn with tactile enhancement is better than doing it to the bra models printed in JC Penney ad circulars. It completely overlooks that both activities are fruitless and distracting wastes of time. Before technology, men left that shit behind with the end of adolescence. Now, they continuously succumb to the addiction spawned by their hijacked dopamine receptors. Most who go “in” are incapable of deciding thereafter to leave.Stick to the gymnasium and the library. The post-technological playground is nothing but Nietzsche’s abyss.

            True about women. Despite all the equality, it’s still men who invite all the REALLY important stuff. However, the feminazis won’t give up on the narrative that women invented everything but it was all stolen by men. I happened to read a new science text book in the local bookshop the other day, and the men have been all but erased. And when a male scientist is included, there is always a big shout out to the little lady who really did all the work. One chapter is called Mr and Mrs Pasteur.

        The microprocessor and DSP algorithms and hardware fundamentally transformed media.Who the elites are and who can control violence in the real world are in the end who and what will matter. That will never change.The SV plutocrats know this which is why they are all pivoting to defense industry. There is a scramble on there between Thiel, Luckey and that faction and the alien psychopaths like Eric Schmidt and that cabal who already control the passification/agitation mechanism of digital media.Part of the scramble is that this is one of the last places left to loot the dying empire and the place where looting it leaves you in control of violence in the real world when it is finally dead.Another part of that SV faction are the Andreeson types who are quadrupling down on hyper capitalist pseudo-entreprenurial venture development as the only problem we have and solution we need. Of course, they too rely on the dying empire’s printing press for asymmetric paper gains.In some sense, we have the potential to be back to an earlier age of innovation where massive capital infusions may not be necessary. For our tribe and our survival, even though we are being purged from the civilization our fathers built, we can focus our intelligence and our skill in developing technology and applications of it on the outside. Of course, at some point we need to choose one of the SV factions and I believe the Thiel/Luckey … one is a better bet. There is a chance to slingshot past them.At the same time, libraries and men who can perform heroic deeds in real life will always have their place. This is particularly true as the anarcho-tyranny continues to increase in intensity. Someone will need to protect themselves and our people.The micro-processor age has not run its course. However, the future belongs to us if we continue to be at its Vanguard and select our faction wisely. At the same time, we must resume control of our cultural transmission mechanism and actively engage our youth in learning from it and we must actively engage them in developing non-passive real life masculine skills and recreation.The world is bi-furcating. The passive, spoon-fed bugman, even if he can harness the digital for a lucrative YT channel, is subject of who rules. He is either dictated to or slavish in some way or another. It is up to us to be the active, well-rounded vanguard of both the digital and the physical realms. Who is grounded in the real world and is the master and guardian of physical space is and always will be his own master, or at least have a seat at the table and deal from a position of strength.

            In some sense, we have the potential to be back to an earlier age of innovation where massive capital infusions may not be necessaryWhat for?? Why would any observant person suspect or believe that the tribes and nations of Europe are dying out for want and shortage of precious novelties and capital infusion, whatever their size? The lower classes of other breeds still reproduce in huge numbers. Technology and novelty have little to do with it except, maybe, to reduce the rate as they, too, come under the spell of your secularism.We are polluted by a combination of bad ancient ideas about existence,bad modern ideas (which few have attempted tochallengewith any rigor), toxic institutions and theirresidues, and unruly, undisciplined thirst for desireable sense objects. The old time sects of our ancestors fail to deal with this situation coherently, and can’t, for they are fundamentally sensualist, like every Abrahamic sect ofegoism. The ancestors’ sects are the least cohesive of the Abrahamisms, which explains much of the extreme fragmentation of these sects and our distant ancestors’ contemporary descendants.we are being purged from the civilization our fathers builtIs that a feature or a bug of their civilization?we must resume control of our cultural transmission mechanismWhat culture do you want to transmit? It sure looks like you’re dedicated to transmitting a fatal syndrome.The passive, spoon-fed bugman…was educated inyour K through 12 system, which was developed and bequeathed by wrong headed ancestors and forebears. Bugman is preoccupied with experiencing sensual novelties developed and marketed by capital. He is a consumer cultivated by the civilization developed and bequeathed by wrong headed ancestors and forbears

                “Capital infusion” is only dominant in those areas where that is a comparative advantage. Otherwise there would be no point to “wasting” all that capital — those firms would be out-competed.
The question is why governments enact policies to incentivize “capital infusion” rather than let capital seek its own level, which would almost certainly be vastly less than it is now.
Consider US automobile manufacturing, from a couple thousand companies down to maybe a dozen? Fewer if you “adjust” for private labels and joint ventures?

                we are being purged from the civilization our fathers builtIs that a feature or a bug of their civilization?What does it matter? It is the system now. And what is your point?we must resume control of our cultural transmission mechanismWhat culture do you want to transmit? It sure looks like you’re dedicated to transmitting a fatal syndrome.I want to transmit every positive feature of Indo-European culture. One of the big features I want to transmit is the one where the teacher/leader never had to lift a hand to pick the whiny, self-defeatist and antagonist up by the scruff of the neck and teach him a lesson – clear enough that he either never comes back to interrupt subsequent lessons or finds a new attitude that is more constructive. He doesn’t have to because the group is full of hardened boys already young men, who value themselves and their inheritance not to put up with such whiny antagonists and who happily deliver said lessons out of self interest.

        More than 95% of the elite have not heard of Nick Fuentes nor other Digital Men. Even most Dan Bongino-type conservatives haven’t heard of him. Maybe even a majority of Ben Shapiro enjoyers. Here is a short list of living people that most people (normies and elite) know as “far right figures”:*Donald Trump*Richard Spencer*David Duke*Harrison Butker (for another week)I’ll bet most under-60s still get the majority of their news from NYT/NPR/BBC push notifications. Suburban peasants will not seek out shitlords like Nick. Nick may be well-known in the DR sphere, our little corner in the global media supernetwork, but that’s about it, and that’s what it will always be.Nick is not the future. It’s some j-school retard who will use whatever media conglomerate he works for to send push notifications to the casual and incurious normie political news reader.

                Yeah, and ironically he’s notactuallyvery right-wing… justrelativelyright-wing.He’s basically a 1960s-1980s conservative Democrat. He thinks that the border should be defended, he thinks that men have sex with hot blondes, he thinks that the military is the world’s kickass force for good, and that American union manufacturing is the best in the world.It’s almost as of the past sixty years never happened — the Vietnam clusterfuck, feminism, the mainstreaming of faggotry, the mainstreaming of affirmative action, the decimation of Midwestern manufacturing, the absolute subservience of this country it Israel and to Jewish power, the tens of millions of illegals, the corruption of the law, the evisceration of the Constitution.It’s not possible to make America great again. I’m glad he’s trying, because he has all the right enemies, but it’s a quixotic quest.

                Trump is a disruptor (maybe).  The effort now is one of a populist uprising of which Trump is the embodiment.  The “uniparty” is under attack, not the Dem’s—or even the Leftists.  This is why Trump is under such attack by Dem’s, Rep’s, and Leftists.  To paraphrase from the old days:, “ It’s the uniparty, stupid.”

                        Who is then?  It’s not the man per se, but what the people think the man is.  Trump is a populist based on his supporters and his enemies.

        So many jobs now demand sitting in front of a computer all day. It is not something masculine men prefer doing, so many of these jobs are now women’s work. For example, most hospital jobs have gone paperless, which means lots of computer time for even the physicians, so they are increasingly female. When the hospital where I worked went to full electronic medical record, the surgeons rebelled (surgeons are typically the most macho docs). They demanded that the HMO hire physicians assistants to do most of the computer work and the HMO complied.

        Nick Fuentes is getting a lot of air time around here these days. I forgot all about that silly boy. I heard wood mention him and a guy who calls himself sneaker the first time I stopped to listen to what he had to say a few days ago.I think he was at the castle. The Owen guy from info wars was a speaker at that event, I could be wrong about that. I passed anyway. Great post today.

            A round of Fuentes shilling is happening, so a round of “Hey stop shilling that fed homo” is rising to meet it. Everyone is tired of hearing about him, but a lot is invested in him from “both sides” so he’ll be a media personality (eventually in gay porn) for the rest of our lives.
