        This election has been interesting. It shows how many of the conservative bloggers have been bought off. I still don’t get it. If you are attempting to make money on a blog, why would you insult the people that regularly read you? I’ve had to drop blogs that I’ve read for years because I can’t have even a simple discussion without getting personally attacked for my preference for President.It became obvious to me that it was all virtue signaling. This election splits down economic and class lines. The bloggers I used to read don’t want to be associated with the Dirt People any more than the lefty journalist do.

            There is virtue signaling, but there is also income or the hope of income or advancement.Tocqueville–Not only is a democratic people led by its own taste to centralize its government, but the passions of all the men by whom it is governed constantly urge it in the same direction. It may easily be foreseen that almost all the able and ambitious members of a democratic community will labor unceasingly to extend the powers of government, because they all hope at some time or other to wield those powers themselves. Philosophic systems that destroy human individuality will have secret attractions for men who live in a democracy.

            “It became obvious to me that it was all virtue signaling.”Yes indeed.  And I find it very interesting.  As you observe, the great division that has opened up this election in what had been a more or less unified Right/GOP comes down to those who wish to publicly proclaim their virtue in the very same manner as the left does, and over the same issues – namely race and sexual identity – and those on what is now called the alt-right who reject the “diversity” and “multicultural” rackets and the cultural assumptions and public policies that undergird them.  And for questioning this pillar of leftist orthodoxy, large numbers of people in the “conservative” camp are vilified as bigots by the pajama boys at NR and others, who all the while believe themselves to be the guardians and gatekeepers of “acceptable” conservatism – even as they go about doing the left’s dirty work for them.  And this is all the stranger because there is no “conservative” issue at stake here – only a question as to how far one is committed to leftist assumptions and how far one is prepared to go to defend them.There is something in this akin, I think, to the left’s inability to honestly address Islamic supremacism, because to do so would call into question too many core beliefs – beliefs which are ultimately quasi-religious and utopian in nature.  NR’s “conservatism” is also reductionist and utopian in that it still adheres to the notion that limited, constitutional government can still be had somehow, with multiculturalism and lower taxes for all.  At its core, the alt-right critique of our current situation is an admission that the NR version of GOP-inspired utopia is no longer attainable or feasible, that the rot is too deep, and we need to try to salvage something from the wreckage before it’s too late. This the Buckley Boys and Reagan Cultists are not prepared to admit.  And as they manfully man the barricades of allowable opinion it’s plain to see that they have learned another fundamental lesson from left:  It’s easier, and more far more personally satisfying, to call your opponent a racist than it is to call them a pessimist. But at least Kevin Williamson and Rich Goldberg can feel good about themselves.  At least for a little while longer.

        “To the person suffering in the present, however, the momentary high from joining a white identity group, for example, feels like salvation.”Momentary high? Hardly. It’s more like the wonderful feeling of relief you get when you stop beating your head against a wall. Considering that the Progressives adopted identity politics 50 years ago, it seems like whites have been exceedingly slow to figure out the obvious: identity politics works.

            I make racial comments, not out of malevolence, but as prediction:As we become a prison society, we will naturally coalesce along racial lines, like prison gangs do- and for the same reasons of mutual protection.
Or, as they say in prison,You can run or you can fight-If you run, you run alone;When comes time to put your boots to someone,You ride with your own.

        Some years back, suddenly and out of the blue, just about every TV news / talk show proclaimed that candidate so and so lacked “gravitas.”I forget about whom this comment was directed but that is besides the point.This struck me as odd because until that time I had never heard of the word “gravitas” on TV or anywhere else for that matter. It was if every TV “news” and/or talk personality (i.e., propagandists) was reading from the same sheet of paper.Until then it had not occurred to me that the TV “news” and talk show were being fed material by outside sources.Also rather odd is that one of (all?) the main TV “news” stations has a “political director.”Why would a news reporting program have or need a political director? This is directly out of the USSR’s playbook.Lastly, if you recall when Ronald Reagan was President, there was the daily drumbeat on TV “news”  about the homeless problem. The moment Bill Clinton became president, the homeless problem disappeared.How convenient.The ZMAN mentioned how the disaffected migrate to mass movements. The classic work on this is THE TRUE BELIEVER, THE NATURE OF MASS MOVEMENTS, by Eric Hoffer.Everybody should read this book.

            I very distinctly remember a network news piece during the Reagan administration where someone – probably Sam Donaldson – was interviewing a wretched, filthy, urine-soaked bum latying in some ally.Sam: “How did you come to be homeless, sir?”Piss bag: “Reagonomics”I was watching that with my dad when I was fresh out of college. We both went “awwww geeeeze” , simultaneously.That was the moment, for me, that lamestream media lost credability.I also remember Sam Donaldson constantly badgering Reagan. No letup. That sort of questioning (which is a good thing) completely dissapears for democrats. Obama should be in prison.  For the IRS abuses, if nothing else.

                The ‘moment’ for me was in the Late 80’s  Katie Couric was invited in to do a fluff interview with George and Barbara.  She went straight for the throat; and I have hated her guts ever since.  Her and the MSM.

                The moment for me was Jimmy Carter’s fricking grandma.  Every news show was “look at his wonderful grandma, now look at the bumbling President Ford”.  I was only 14 and it was obvious to me.

                Pretty sure it was Al Gore’s gravi-tahss in the approach to the 2000 elections.Limbaugh pointed out that and a number of other repetitions.One does notice that in the “highly competitive news environment”, shows all talk about the same subject on the same day- it is a different subject for left or right, but each day, each side talks about only one or two main items.  I travel constantly, and have noticed this coordination in every market nationwide.

        “It’s not a coherent intellectual movement, but simply a refuge from the endless assault on ordinary people,”That phrase — “the endless assault on ordinary people” — pretty much sums up what’s drawn me into the orbit of the alt-right. I’m not an angry, hateful guy. I don’t nurse fantasies about Christian theocracy or white nationalism. I’m just sick of being made to feel like a bigot and a criminal for being normal and having normal human emotions.I read “1984” again recently, and it’s stunning how well it captures the feelings I feel every single day. I turn on the television and read the news and it feels like everybody else has gone insane and I’m the only sane person left. Normally I’d conclude that I’m the insane one, except I have clear, distinct memories of last week, when Oceania was at war with Eurasia instead of Eastasia. I look around at the other people shouting about how we’ve always been at war with Eastasia and I wonder, do they have the same memories I do? Because it sure seems like they don’t.The alt-right is like a refuge of sanity — it’s the only place I can go where everybody else remembers that, yeah, we WERE at war with Eurasia last week! I’m actually NOT crazy for remembering it that way!

            I had the “road to Damascus moment” with NR back in the post-Katrina days (2005) when the entire NRO team sounded like a bunch of excited junior high girls. I tried to explain that, in my experience, every hurricane season the city sent out the same statement: “If you fail to evacuate expect no help for 10 to 14 days.”  This drew the response from J. Podhoretz that friends don’t let friends blog drunk….
I cancelled NR immediately after 20 years….

        I agree wholeheartedly with the opening sentence; about coordination in the news media.  I work in an operations center; and we normally have FOX and CNN; and sometimes MSLSD on at the same time.  It is uncanny how three; supposedly different ‘news’ source; wind up sounding exactly alike.  The same stories at the same exact time.  The ‘Info Babes’ even wear the same colored dresses.If you didn’t have multiple TVs on; you would never see it.  I am convinced that the ‘news source’ has got to be the CIA; or some other central propaganda machine.  My brother used to say; ‘The USSR is just a figment of the CIA’s imagination.’  I firmly agree with that assessment. They fell completely apart after the wall came down.  Along came Osama Din Laden; and the Bogeyman was back.

            Back when John Derbyshire was purged, he made the point that these guys are all men with careers, bills to pay, ambition, etc. Faced with the choice between being honest and keeping their paying jobs, they naturally choose the latter. What’s Williamson going to do? Drive a truck? Writing for National Review, making $50K a year, is the top of the rung for these guys. When you get a little higher to the people with TV contracts or speaking careers, they have six figure incomes and no other way to make that kind of money. Rich Lowry is one poorly chosen word or phrase away from economic ruin.As far as the amen chorus you see with these posts, some of it is sock-puppetry. A lot of it is simply the result of years of indoctrination. Some is just the nature of things. People tend to prefer the safest course, even if it means slavery. Unless a man has the skill to make something of himself, freedom is a burden.

                Want a fun way to waste an hour. Go there and bomb the comment section, over and over. Make them feel besieged and under attack. Conduct a little psyops to demoralize them. It’s great.

                “Unless a man has the skill to make something of himself, freedom is a burden.”  Ever read Erich Fromm’s “Escape from Freedom”?  He makes a similar point at book length.  It’s worth reading for the classic display of the 2nd law of SJW — a Frankfurt School Marxist, Fromm thought he was describing the psychological profile of rank-and-file Nazis.  Take out the Hitler references, though, and you have a spot-on description of modern liberals (NR types included)…. and Frankfurt School Marxists.  It’s smart-but-directionless guys like Goldberg, Williamson, et al, whose brains don’t work in economically desirable ways, who inflict the real misery on the world.

                Look at the ministers, the politicians, union bosses, police and fire chiefs, the college professors, college presidents, and the news people, among others.  They have well paying, easy jobs that ask of them nothing more than to toe the line, and to claw their way to the top amongst their peers.  What is in it for them to stray?  What else are they trained and qualified for?  Cut out the $100k-plus compensation and see how many get a backbone.  The sad thing is that in toeing the line, they are quite willing to throw the rest of us and our own culture over the side.

            Yeah, I’ve been disappointed about the number of people I’ve had to quit reading in disgust over the past year or so. I tell myself I’d probably be the same way if I were in their position, though. If I were getting paid a six-figure salary to parrot donor class bullshit, it would be awfully hard to walk away from that, because I’d know it would be unlikely that I’d make that much money doing something else.
The flip side, I guess, is that being poor give me more freedom to say what I really think.

        The left in the UK, more than well-represented in the media, automatically and openly label anyone who doesn’t support the government line on muslim immigration as “far-right”, yet curiously these are the same people who repeatedly label the government — for allegedly not doing enough left-wing things — as right-wing.
Sometimes I get a little confused…

        I followed 2 out of 3 links (Tracinski &amp; Tuttle) and that was quite enough. Those guys sound like they should be protesting chalk on some campus and demanding their very own safe space rather than calling any and all in the conservative tent with whom they disagree racists.OK, there are racists Democrats ( I almost resisted writing tautology.), Republicans, Conservatives and, I’m sure, even Libertarians and Antichrists, -but suddenly the cry of ‘Racists!’, true or false, negates and devalues anything else such people believe or say.Obviously racists is the new pedophile. We need a national registry to assure none are allowed within 100 yards of a voting booth or a political party.Shucky darn, racists has become such a tar brush we’ll soon have to remove it from polite society and start calling it the R-word!Racists. Dang, over the years I’ve had many friends who were racist, and other than that aberration, were quite nice and intelligent people. Folks  that I would trust to protect my back any time.Oh, by the way, a fair number of the racists I’ve known that I would call  friends happen to be black.Please excuse the rant, Tracinski &amp; Tuttle left me fuming.Excellent post, Zman!

            Tuttle graduated from St. John’s in 2014.  A Buckley Fellow, he is so happy to be running with what he views as a big dog that he has no qualms about parroting (or plagiarizing) what they are saying.

        Z says: “The Cold War is over. What’s left of Buckley Conservatism is the weird half of Frank Meyer Fusionism and the purging. Over the last 25 years the list of people purged reads like a who’s who of important writers of the American Right.”
Curious as to names of those who have been purged.
Are any, many, still writing?
