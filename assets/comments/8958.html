        The principle reason housing is so ridiculously, insanely, unfathomably expensive is because, excepting the almighty dollar, there is no legal method by which people can choose their neighbors and the children with whom their children go to school.An unfathomable amount of “national wealth” is tied up in grossly inflated housing prices which sole purpose is to get away from the diversity. And of course with Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, not only do the naïve, middle-class sheep get to pay way too much for some cookie-cutter suburban houses, but with their tribute to the IRS they get to pay to move the Section 8 race warriors into their neighborhoods. And of course the biggest producers of housing are in on the gambit.Untold millions of normal Americans have been totally wiped out in the great grinding gears of this machine. Turns out, shearing the white middle class into oblivion is extremely profitable.White flight, a trillion-dollar business.

            Yup, I was mentally screaming “Section 8, Section 8” as I read through this post.

            But if you pay attention you notice that those Section 8 developments are never dumped on upper-middle-class communities. They are always dumped on white middle-class areas, turning those middle-class areas into future slums. The people who have enough money to get out do so. Those who don’t, are stuck.

                Make no mistake: it’s working itself up the ladder. And it’s accelerating, too. Fifty years ago it was the working class, now it’s the middle class, in ten or twenty years max it will creep into the upper-middle class. In thirty years anyone not already “grandfathered in” will need to be “local rich” and above to be able to afford to insulate themselves, and even they will be increasingly disenfranchised in their major institutions like the elite colleges.Then it will jjust be the global elite sitting atop the world. I suspect, but cannot prove, that they have seceded from the nominally top colleges into their own fully private bubble. Harvard nowadays is hopelessly upper-middle-class.

                    Oh, it’s made it up to the toney new “island” community in Charleston. Section 8. They don’t call it that, and they have a pretty tight filter on new applicants, but it’s there.  Heck, the new Section 8 housing in the poorer areas near town is designed to look very appealing to white middle class. Because town planners know that white urbanites will eventually be unable to resist making it their exclusive uptown enclave.

        The civil rights laws breached our rights of association. After all, if you believe that it is wrong to discriminate based on the color of a person’s skin, it was only a matter of time before the logic of that argument could be used to justify the acceptance of homosexuality…and beyond. Civil rights was the emotional wedge issue that radical leftists used to lull America into the welfare state. The stupid politicians fell for it. Now that we do not have any rights of association, I see no way to stop government intrusion into our private lives in myriad directions. Obamacare is one such breach. It may require a violent revolution to restore our rights. Jim Crow laws were not put in place to humiliate blacks. They were put in place to protect whites. Northerners in lily white neighborhoods had trouble understanding this. But they do now. Whites fled the inner city school integration plans of the 70s and 80s to preserve what was left of their rights. And to preserve their safety. But there is no guarantee the government can’t plop hundreds of non-white refugees in your midst one fine day. Rights of association, indeed. The way things are going, whites will be looking back wistfully on those Jim Crow laws of the 50s.

        I recently became aware of AirBNB’s community commitment and was so disgusted, so fed up with it all that I wrote the management a letter and then cancelled my account with them.  I wrote, in part:I just used Airbnb twice this past month and had plans to continue to use it but no more.  Being a good guest who left my hosts’ homes in as good of condition as I found them, always taking the dirty sheets off, bundling the dirty towels together, doing all the dishes, wiping down the counters and putting everything away before leaving way ahead of the required check out time apparently is just not enough.  We have to swear fealty to the new oath to prove we are worthy of being Airbnb customers. . .When I used Airbnb in the past, I never bothered to find out what sex, race, or religion my hosts were or what gender they were most comfortable with.   Why?  BECAUSE I WAS PLANNING MY TRIP.  I was always interested in my hosts’ property, not them.  But that also was not enough right?   Because I might have been harboring some deep seated discriminatory feelings that would only go away if I check your little commitment box, right?Do whatever you think is best for your business.   It no longer matters to me.Since sending the letter, I have not heard back from Air BNB and do not expect to.  I just refuse to participate in their little social experiment.  I will not play along.  I don’t need them.At any rate, I love this essay.  You nailed precisely why their commitment actually works AGAINST the individual and against freedom.

            On a similar principle I stopped shopping at Target. They don’t need me, I don’t need them. I can do this because I have options. One day, I may have to make a more difficult choice – do business, buy and sell, or not. That’s when principle becomes more than a standard, it becomes a life or death choice.

        Gays targeting bakers over cake messages is also a reflection that it is easy for the violent left to go after ‘soft’ targets who are less likely to fight back. Trying that on with the baking members of the One True Faith would bring all sorts of problems down on the Gays, and anyway who cares about Christians in our modern, caring ‘n’ sharing world of equality?

        The only way to not lose the game, is to not play it.  Let them have the public place, and let them have it to themselves. They don’t want just the public space they want everyone and everything in it to stay. That’s always the problem that the Cloud People can’t quite grasp.

        Will this philosophy ever get applied to college &amp; pro sports?   It’s already happening in K-12 with everyone gets a trophy b.s.
Winning requires identifying and rewarding those with greater capacities to perform.   If your NBA basketball team ends up mostly if not all black, that’s okay.  Even if women are excluded, hispanics rarely make the grade, and whites increasingly don’t either.

            The same people who hate the rich, but buy lottery tickets every week. We are all the same, BUT Indians, negroes, women, gays, immigrants … all get special status and protections and largess and privilege .. .. from who ??? The endangered species known as White Men whose illusion of privilege vanished forty years ago. We are just noticing it big time, lately. Men, being men, have been broad-shouldered about our diminishing status in the world, but all of our masculine outer shell is all used up and you are now hitting the meat. That is where it stops.

        Insightful, as always. What I wonder is if there is a way to peacefully retake any portion of the public space. Trump and co have been shifting the overton window rightward–surely there’s something to be done in any of these particular cases.

            The best, most realistic way to wrest our power back from the federal government, and to move toward our founding principles, is to proceed quickly with an Article V Convention of states, to propose and pass amendments to the Constitution. I suggest that we all agree to pass Mark Levin’s 11 Liberty Amendments *in toto*.I really wish he had included one more amendment to abolish the IRS, and still another to abolish the Federal Reserve and outlaw fractional reserve banking, but if we pass the first excellent slate of amendments, we will have time and energy to consider and expedite a few others.I hope that DJT, should he raise his right hand on 1-20-17, will that very day voice his full support for the existing Article V efforts, and help accelerate the process.

No. The 1st Cos should concentrate on 2 items: 1) Remove the ability of 280 DC creatures to raise the fed gov’t debt limit and give it to 3/4 of state legislatures. 2) Term limit all federal employment to 12 years total lifetime per citizens.  1 grab the credit card 2 wholesale purge of the fed gov’t.

            Shifting the overton window? Good point. Somehow I have the sneaking intuition shifting it a wee bit to the right may not be enough. The FBI choked again. Looks like the Praetorian Guard was true to form. Illegitimacy is they name and they god. This country will be ungovernable if Vagina.com/Crime/Inc is installed.How about nuking that window from orbit… “Just to be sure”.This will bake a few noodles:THE PEAT PARTYhttp://alternative-right.blogspot.com/2016/11/the-peat-party.html#more

            It’s called “competition.”  This is where someone with the resources steps in and shellacks Airbnb in the ass with a service that people want.  Those that want to “belong” can keep their community.  Those that want BnB services will flock to a free business.  Airbnb policies are not law.  Fuck them.

                Air BnB swallowed too much of the “sharing economy” Kool-aid.  Funny but the sharing economy model was never about sharing; it was (and is) always a commercial and financial arrangement for mutual benefit.  So both parties have to be comfortable with the arrangement.  Back when I first joined Air BnB, I (among the many thousands of individuals offering to rent out their homes), I figured it was a good way to offset the cost of my travel/vacations by allowing someone else to pay a portion of the rent for a Manhattan apartment I didn’t use while out of town.  They provided a platform for those who needed a place to stay to contact those willing to rent out their homes on a short-term basis.  They also provided services to help total strangers negotiate the terms of the arrangement &amp; feel comfortable with their counterparties, especially the party renting their home.  I NEVER had any problems with those I rented to, in large part because I was very careful with who I allowed to stay in my home while I was gone (plus I’d make them fork up a considerable case deposit to be returned only upon my determining after coming home that all was good to go.).  Then about two years ago, Air BnB became concerned with stories of some vacation home applicants being turned down for a home or an apartment for “unknown” reasons.  It was clear that some home owners didn’t want to rent to people from certain racial/ethnic groups or those of a certain sexual orientation.  Rather than just accept the reality that the one who owns the home does not want to open it to everyone on Air BnB’s database, Air BnB has tried to force the issue by shaming renters.  It’s not going to work and I expect they’ll soon their cute little dot.com, sharing economy business model has been irreparably damaged.
