            i always think that, with regard to unemployment numbers, why doesn’t the government cease unemployment benefits? Since the number is based on “claims for unemployment benefits”, it seems logical to just cut everyone off, and claim zero unemployment!
I freely give the G my idea with no charge.

                You could only do this if you:Paid out dollar for dollar what was paid in by each individual and each employer.Eliminated off-shoring and importing laborAs just a couple of things. Aside from the coming waves of “NGO” funded unemployed who will be lining up beside tomato pickers for work, there are a lot of skilled people who produce who are having a hard time finding work in the face of the end of ZIRP and a global workforce.Unless or until the country changes from being an international bazaar for labor and capital and being in support of its core population, that is a reform that is tough to do. Though I do say that there should not be a single non-Heritage American working in the admin of these programs. It is absurd but perhaps fitting of the GAE that many of those gravy jobs are taken by non-Americans.The corruption is hopeless. As Z-Man said. This is just a first step and the fight that is going to break out over this is going to be vicious.

                    As I’ve said many times before, there is a huge pool of willing intelligent white workers that cannot be hired due to criminal background checks…eliminating that requirement would go a long way to solving the shortage of workers. The 19 year old whose life is permanently ruined and his ability to find employment stifled for decades,  because he forwarded to a few friends his underage girlfriends boobpic is one example, another would be the 35 year old father whose vindictive ex-wife coaches their children to say Daddy touched my secret place, in order to ruin him and take away his ability to earn. There’s a certain knee jerk reaction to these crimes, many of which in previous times would merit no more than a slap on the wrist and a good talking to, but now it provides a huge make-work industry for bitter lesbians.

                        *raises hand*Me! A brown guy got very upset by a text message and spun an entire story out of whole cloth around it which the liberal white DC LEOs ate up w/o checking -any- facts. A SWAT raid and 5 charges later and I was unemployable for 7 of my prime earning years for –nothing– based on unverified hearsay. Lost multiple offers from this so much so that I basically gave up for a long while. :-/I was a very early adopter of the lawfare that started in the 2020 Floyd Riots and culminated very overtly on J6. What you say is 100% true but sadly will probably not be looked at.

                The fact is that millions of working class white tradesmen depend on unemployment to help them get through the winter months when weather forces construction to grind to a near halt.  I realize that this entitlement is subject to massive fraud and abuse by the Lazy, so I am certainly for creating stricter guidelines for UI, like shortening the period of time it can be collected and eliminating extensions, and especially making it unavailable to aliens, legal or illegal. Honest people lose their jobs unexpectedly all the time through no fault of their own.  Temporary help for them is part of a society taking care of its own.It seems a better solution would be to end all welfare/tax entitlements and incentives for aliens immediately, and submit a bill for back taxes on all of these alien businesses going back 30 years.  Require voluntary and permanent sterilization for all welfare applicants, while enforcing the strictest criteria for approval for NBCs, to include monthly intensive drug screens.  Limit food stamps to the purchase of meat and vegetables only. I could go on and on but you get the idea.

                    Yes, but…
Had a great-uncle in the construction business. It was seasonal work then, too. So you had the choice of working so much OT that you could stay at home through the winter, or you could go build houses somewhere warm like California or Florida.
I blame UI for the lion’s share of our housing shortage. Some builders are wasting a third or more of their time sitting home cashing UI. Just that alone is enough to explain why we are not even close to the high water of 2.5 million housing starts under Nixon.

So you had the choice of working so much OT that you could stay at home through the winter, or you could go build houses somewhere warm like California or Florida.”How long ago was that?  50-60 years ago?  Longer?  Have you taken a look at the disparity between wages and cost of living since then?I am in the trades and sorry pal I don’t get to choose how much OT I get.  For teamsters, there are hours of service restrictions now that didn’t exist in your great uncle’s day, including a whole shitload of OSHA like regulation. Not many working men can afford to move back and forth from Chicago to Florida every year.“I blame UI for the lion’s share of our housing shortage.”Well then you’re extremely out of touch.  You should be blaming the unchecked immigration that is wrecking the country.There are arguments to be made for restricting UI but your comment is delusional.

                Part of the fraud is the lie undergirding the farcical distinction between ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ aliens.  Many come on what are known as ‘tourist’ visas when they never planned to return home in the first place (and that alone technically disqualifies them from ever ‘legally’ immigrating) – then they marry someone, or get someone to offer them a job, and apply to ‘adjust status.’  And like magic, they are now in the US ‘legally.’  Same goes for those who apply for immigrant visas and claim income/jobs they don’t actually have, or lie about previous stays in the US.  It’s easy enough to document (I used to do so) but no one in the fedgov wants to know – I had the FBI tell me not to bother them back in the ’80s.

                        Add all the post 1965 non-White immigrants and their progeny, and we’d getrid of 135 million people and over half our crime.  Same for unemployment, supposed housing shortage, and ‘crowded’ schools.  US was fine with 200 million.  Much too crowded now.

                            You can dream, and I’m with you since I’m not a post-1965 baby 😂, but our entire banking system would fall apart having to eat that many defaulting mortgages and having to deal with that many empty houses, office buildings, commercial structures, auto plants, etc. That would be one radical downsizing.

                                        The dirty little secret is that most banks will be perfectly fine. No mortgage that has gone through a refinance is held by the bank, and most which have not been refinanced have also been sold off to creditors.
Banks will not take the hit. The secondary market will.

                            Legal immigrants, applying for naturalization, used to have to sign a register weekly at the local post office. This was in the days before mass commercial air flight, expanded visas, and civil rights.
We tracked the dickens out of people not a citizen.It was a big change because at the turn of the century, an Englishman didn’t need a passport, or permission from his government to come and go as he pleased.
Better, I think that we “looted” them in their countries, than them looting us in ours. Africans are bitching cuz we paid them for digging their dirt?

                    There is a certain personality type that rejects propaganda. It isn’t necessarily correlated with intelligence or other traits that would be the usual suspects, either, and I have yet to put my finger on it. Trotsky once opined that you could attach even dubious authority to a false proposition and the educated classes would buy into it and the workers would remain skeptical. I don’t think he was right about the economic aspect but he definitely was onto something there.

                            There is a big difference between PhDs of yesteryear and those of today. PhD used to be a signal of higher intelligence, though advisors played a key role in keeping a thesis topic sufficiently narrow for the intellect of the candidate.
But today those departments are largely foreigners, in large part because they are used to dealing with arbitrary and capricious authorities.

            All of the numbers around the economy are bullshit.  When the “Great Recession” happened, it started in the last quarter of 07.  But the BLS lied about the numbers and gave us positive growth for the quarter.  Only 6 months later did they revise the numbers down and tell the truth.  We were in the great recession for 9 months without anyone knowing it.  Same with unemployment and inflation.  They are propaganda and are meant to manage the public’s expectations.Keep in mind that we’ve had this “vibrant and dynamic” economy since 2001 when China was let into the WTO and the great flushing sound of our manufacturing economy being siphoned to China has been going on.  What we’ve actually had was 25 years of money printing, bubbles and inflation.  This is unprecedented in human history.  We had 3 bubbles in a row.  They used to be once in a generation when they happened at all.

                We in the financial services industry sure as heck knew the music was stopping in late 2007.  2007 was the largest bonus I ever got.  Laid off in the summer of ’08.
However, almost none of us saw a collapse.

                When we stopped manufacturing things, we started manufacturing bubbles. (I’m not the first person to say that). More lengthy analysis has compared this to the financialization of the Edwardian era, which felt prosperous at the time to the people living through it. Late stage empire stuff.

                    I’m pretty sure the “magic gas” that’s been inflating every successive bubble has been our reserve currency status. The rest of the world goes along with America’s periodic madness because the dollar is too useful a medium of exchange. Questioning the value of the bubble assets too heavily could throw the whole system into chaos. Tars’ makes a good point above about the unprecedented nature of the bubbles. Previous historical bubbles like the tulip bulb craze were not propping up the currency itself though.

            Lying to the public ( ‘propaganda’ ) is far older than todays’ manipulation of the most powerful medium ever for twisting minds, the talmudvision. Prior to the tv, radio and  newspapers- which were bad enough to create the Spanish-American War, WWs 1 and 2.  “Symbols rule the world” ( h/t ‘Vigilant Citizen” ) and the power of visual propaganda has destroyed the West (as planned ). Nearly everything I was taught beginning in grade school in the 50s was a lie, a lie I finally copped to with LBJ smirking on the plane.

                    Symbols are a metalanguage, like ideograms or hieroglyphs, reaching deep down past the literalness of linear alphabets which are more suited to (white male) frontal neocortex thinking.
The Bible is filled withesoteric messaging, directly related to the racial politics, that is, the culture war of ethnic dominance being conducted within the Tribes.

                        Offer Eve something better?  More empowerment and groveling perhaps?In her disobedience and empowerment, why should she be offered anything?  As if she’s some downtrodden, shortchanged Victim who must be placated and cooed to?You blame the serpent.  Well, God blamed the serpent too, and gave him dust to eat.Unlike yourself, God also blamed the woman, for coveting to be equal to God, and greater than the man.  God punished her so although you are ready to waive-off the curses she brought upon herself, I am not, and neither is He.Likewise, God blamed the man and punished him and his male descendants.All three were as guilty as sin.  Still are.Here’s what Eve is offered: a last chance to repent of her arrogance, covetousness, and rebellion before the gate shuts forever.  Get down on your entitled knees and face, and beg pardon of God.

Likewise, Hollywood was founded by 7 Usuals because filming in sunny orange groves was cheap.  I can’t deny that some people have a real talent for exploiting an opportunity.

                    Normie media consistently refers to “Emilia Erhardt of the UH-OH 60 as a “soldier” – you know, just a reg’lar gal trying to make it in a man’s world. But she was a well-connected, rising star officer, a Captain in the US Army, who hobnobbed with celebs in th White(ish) House.(The other two poor saps on board that Sikorsky were non-coms who probably did their best to ignore her, as she no doubt ignored them. Teamwork!)And as for the 60-odd people on that flight from Kansas…

                        It’s true.  Many years ago the Christian writer Dalrock did a full investigation of the Amelia Earhart scamola.
As usual in matters aeronautic or elsewise, the truth proves far different than the WomanSpin.

                        Point of clarity:  the other two on the 60 were 1) an enlisted crew chief, and 2) a 39 year old Chief Warrant Officer 2.  The warrant officer was, in fact, a commissioned officer. His rather junior warrant rank is somewhat odd, given his age, and the Army’s age limit for entering Initial Entry Rotary Wing Training at Ft Rucker. Time to CW3 is generally less that 12 yr (+\-) interval would suggest.All this is confused more by the fact that he was prior-service Navy (or an inter-service transfer). But for sure he was not a rated aviator in the Navy, given lack of those wings on his Army enlisted photo. Seems to have been wearing the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist badge in the Army photo, as well as a Navy Good Conduct ribbon with subsequent award (old eyes here and poor picture resolution) — min 8 yrs naval service.But rest assured, he was, like the captain, a commissioned officer in the Army. (As an aside, unless now changed, only the WO1 rank is still an “officer by warrant” … on the authority of the service secretary.)He was also (if accurately reported) an Instructor Pilot (and in fact logging time as such … “IP”), thus decisions and responsibility in the aircraft were his.  Though he may (from my perspective) have been a lesser-experienced IP, no low-time captain was going to dispute his authority in that helicopter, absent serious crew training and discipline conditions in that unit.All this is by way of saying that though he was outranked by the female captain, he was in fact the aircraft Pilot-in-Command, and by regulation responsible for all aspects of operation and mission success.Whether she was in fact qualified to perform duties as pilot in command, no sane commander or briefing officerwould sign off on that crew mix with her as PC on the brief sheet.Unlike what the press reports related, she was an exceptionally low time aviator.  450(+) hrs in that airspace would cause me to add additional risk to that missions Risk Assessment. she would only fly with the most experienced aviators. Problems is, the Army suffered a tremendous loss of experienced aviators over the past decade, as crewmembers with multiple deployments hit the exits as soon as able. 1000 hours may actually represent the higher end of their pilot pool. I was used to three to five thousand hours in my senior guys.As to the 60 — the crew is more widely separated than in previous utility craft. There’s a lot of structural “crap” between the pilots and crew in the back, and the wind screen does not provide the same field of view as one had in the UH-1 or OH-58. It’s worse on the vertical axis. And I assure you, if under goggles in that environment, with the vast sea of lights to all sides, it is easy to mis-identify other traffic.Bottom line … even IF they did have a less than collegial relationship with the female captain, the crewmember who did not interact in flight with the others would soon be invited to explore other career options.Now …. There is a question as to their SOP about crewmwmbers in the back.  One on each side to me would be a must under those conditions — training mission; low time crew mix; very compressed, high traffic AO.I will not address here the institutional behaviors that predominate in the Army reference the captain’s particular demographic profile ….

                            I couldn’t help but notice in the photos of the female helicopter captain, especially the one where she’s practically out of her pilot seat, in full pilot costume, inches from the camera, grinning for a selfie, it almost feels like there’s more focus on the “look at me” attitude than on the seriousness of her role. Every time I see the photo, my later boomer recollections unconsiously put the needle down Cindy Laupers vinyl soundtrack: “Girls Just want to have fun”It also brings back personal memories, again automatically triggering Cyndi Lauper’s trademark song, when I think of the selfies taken by an acquaintance’s daughter. She joined the the Marines. In all the service selfies and photos it was a combination of grinning and you go girl attitude. She was a highley attractive college material waif. It seemed she had something to prove. or actually virtue signal, before she later attended college. It seems more about signaling an image and modern mythical archetype than understanding the seriousness of their duties.“oh girls, they wanna have fun…girls just wanna have funnnn”

                            The problem with tick-box females in traditional male jobs is that, as always happens, when they are revealed to be unable to do the job, it is impossible to sack them. That means they are kicked upstairs, which causes even more problems further down the line. Women have no business being in the military, front line police or fire services.

            There used to be a guy who wrote a newspaper column that appeared in the local business paper. His name was Malcolm Berko and he has since passed on. One of his big mantras was the difference between what they report as the inflation rate versus street inflation. There is no way that street inflation is running at 2% or 3%, that was his pet cause that he always wrote about.

        The lies, rot and corruption are pervasive. It’s really interesting to watch the widespread noticing which seems to be occurring and the deep impact this realization has on many people. Friends who are devout Christians are no longer paying tithing as they have gradually discovered their church’s involvement and how that money has been spent: refugee resettlement, migration ministries, church world service, hebrew immigrant aid society to name a few.

            Amen to that.  The charities have become corrupt as well.  If you are a true conservative, you can’t donate to most any of them.  And of course, if you are a liberal, you assume it’s the government’s job to “take care” of everybody.

        I read a book called “CHAOS” By Tom O’Neill that is ostensibly about the Manson murders, but by the end he unpacks how the entire story of the 1960s and everything we think we know about it is fake. The 1960s were a very successful government psy-op. Charles Manson was almost certainly a fed asset who ended up doing exactly what they were hoping he would do. But, it’s not just the 1960s. It’s everything. If the system requires legitimacy to function, our system can’t function because it has no legitimacy anymore. We are at this stage now where even the instruments they tried to setup to maintain legitimacy – things like the “misinformation experts” – are being shown to be totally fake and paid by them. I doubt ANY private money or resources went into the “misinformation industry” – it was ALL funded by the American government. This is where we are.

                I’ve thought about it, and Trump’s recent statements on Gaza really make me think about it. But I think the entire point of this exercise is that this form of fake narrative building cannot last forever. It does rely on people buying in. Like I am not trying to slag boomers here, they were the victims of a great psyop campaign, but they are all in on the government narratives and always have been. So if the boomers somehow were to actually live forever, it’s possible this could go on forever. But they can’t, no matter how unpleasant it might be for them.

                    Yes, it won’t go on forever. But there’s no reason to believe it’s stopped now.
The Trump Hopium and Lovefest of the past two weeks feels too forced to someone who lived through 2016-2020. I don’t trust it at all and I think I have good cause to be suspicious.

                        Thank you!  Trump and Musk are not doing any of this because they are in any way ‘pro-White.’  Musk and the techbros have their own agenda, and Musk even now is busy nuking populist/nationalist Australian and other accounts from “X.”  Trump and his people are not banning all the ethnic groups at West Point because they like White people – and they are not kicking out all the ethnics in the military who have not a scintilla of ‘loyalty’ to heritage America.They are trying to mute the excess ethnic activism because they want a civnat AINO – same way Wilson banned all the German language papers in America in WWI.  And they can and will come down just as hard/harder on White nationalists.  It will be ‘join or die.’

                        I get what you are saying, but WW3 will require a draft. And that still might not be enough. Just getting marginally more white guys isn’t going to cut it. Not in Ukraine or in any other large scale military action that’s not against goatherders. Anybody smart and capable enough to plan and orchestrate all this from at least 9 years ago, for this specific purpose, would have to know that.

Results. Tradeoffs necessary, it is what it is. Every small win is a win.Pile up enough bodies and hills, and you’ve won the war.  Or, at least, stopped the enemy from killing you.

                US intel is powerful and has been powerful for a long time. However, I find it difficult to believe it was capable of orchestrating the entire counterculture. Now it may have supported it once it took root, but that’s rather a different thing.

                    Not to go semantic totalitarian, but it is difficult to disentangle orchestration and support. For example, notice how it has started to emerge that pop culture stars are paid for their support of X? Ben Stiller, Oprah Winfrey, etc.? They granted have made it and can fetch nice prices, but it isn’t unreasonable to assume they were supported (and orchestrated) on the front end.

                        I believe the origins of the counterculture were organic, sociological and structural rather than from a song and dance by the FBI/CIA. Personality type, for instance, is generally set by the age of nine. And it wasn’t US intel that determined an entire generation’s personality type. However, I have no problem whatsoever believing that once US intel saw which way the wind was blowing with the kids, they took advantage to the hilt. They understood that those kids would be the shock troops for the fundamental transformation of America that they desired. And how right they were.

                            If you have a cultural shift underway, and want it to go in a certain direction, you can pump money into those whose direction you prefer. Trends indeed tend to be organic but the direction they take can be influenced and manipulated and orchestrated. McGowan referenced above sometimes conflated organic shifts with the manipulation of their direction, but he was spot on that US intel pushed in certain directions and blocked in others with great effect. I once dismissed that as paranoia. Silly me.

                                Yes, there’s no doubt about that. But I think this manipulation really received a turboboost once the Power Structure (FedGov, Academia, Media, Hollywood, Wall Street) attained homeostasis. It is one thing for the FBI/CIA to try to channel cultural forces in the desired direction. It is something else for the entire Power Structure to do so.IMO, the coalescence of the Power Structure began in the second half of the 60s and concluded in the early 90s. It was at that juncture that we saw the great towering tsunamis of propaganda and indoctrination that levied such a toll on white civilization. The current Power Structure has controlling power the CIA/FBI could only dream of 60 years ago. And it appears Trusk is now attempting to dismantle that power.

                            Yes.  In the case of liberated women, intel targeted and preyed upon the faults and desires already known in woman: covetousness, irresponsibility, vulnerability to social pressure and status, and thirst to rule over the male (to rebel against God the Father).
Intel — mostly CIA back then — got the ball rolling.  The inherent weaknesses in humanity were counted on to do the rest.

                    Not every participant was an asset.  But they did exist and many of the tenets of the hippies were of benefit and use to U.S. and British intel.  McGowan’s book is a good place to begin, tho there are others.

                It’s an interesting book. Whatever his intention, it’s a pop-culture version of a classic type of religious/philosophical poetry, putting an “esoteric gloss” (literary slang for “coat of bullshit”) on the familiar, to tell you something true that you wouldn’t otherwise accept.I’m cursed with being an expert on Frank Zappa. The book misunderstands him entirely and gets everything wrong, especially about his father—as every Zappa book does, except the nerdy equipment litanies and the crazy communist one he actually endorsed. He’d enjoy it if he were here. It’s attitudinally correct, with a kind of paranoiac zen (actual Zen, not the California thing). Then he’d sue the guy.Almost none of the ’60s characters we know were agents of an op. They werein it, not in on it. We all know people who are “deep state” without knowing it. I almost accidentally joined it myself. Same as the abstract expressionists, the feminists, the homos, the “alt right,” the Politico reporters, the…Most of them.

                    McGowan got the outlines right but the particulars wrong, which is sort of awesome. We are doing the same, right here, right now. I am not that familiar with Zappa and will defer to you on that. Yes, McGowan wrongly assumed that someone headed in an intel-friendly direction automatically was a player rather than a chess piece, but he read the game board correctly.All the celebrities revealed to have been paid to endorse Kamala, the propaganda organs funded by State, all of it is tried and true, it just seeps out more quickly now. Can those revelations be stopped or slowed? People are working 24/7/365 to make it stop. They really shouldn’t have convinced Musk’s son that he had a vagina.

                            That’s a good question, but it certainly happened. Maybe to sweeten the pot if a campaign event conflicted with a previously scheduled shake-down? Recall Beyonce not holding a pre-announced concert at a Kamalafest in Houston, and only showing up for a grin ‘n grin? Maybe the world’s greatest country singer only deep-sixed one of her two events previously scheduled for that night. Lee Greenwood may be bargain basement but I suspect he does it for free.

        Have spent a good amount of time on X reading what he’s been disclosed about USAID and what has struck me is that1. The only areas where the money was actually used for a clear purpose were: regime changes (including USA), bribing the media, flooding white countries with brown people and pushing the anal revolution.2. Everything else was just a slush fund for privileged people with, not surprisingly, the Clinton’s being at the forefront of the scam. 4 billion was spent on Haiti after the earthquake and only 2 percent went to Haiti. Chelsea took home a cool 84 million. Nice!3. I had no idea what great salaries the not for profits paid. Seems like a mid tier to honcho level of some generic NGO can (or could) expect to make 500k/yr.I feel like a fool for going to a top 5 biz school and working so hard for so long. I came from a working class background and had no idea this is how the world worked. Well now I do.Of course, the scams in USAID can be found in every government program especially the DOD. We can be sure that the DOD will not be inspected. That would leave Israel vulnerable and that would be anti Semitic.

            Conspicuously absent are revelations about Republicans on the take, and it’s not because Republicans are clean. I had been predicting RFKJ wouldn’t be confirmed, but perhaps this stuff is being used to blackmail the dirty rinos into confirming the nominees. I hadn’t considered that when I made the prediction.As discussed here yesterday, it wasn’t really “bribing” the media. They didn’t need to be bribed. They were/are eager to do what they do. But it was needed to support them, since nobody else would. So what’s likely to happen is the media will continue singing the same songs, but some of them will go out of business.Clown World Inc is no longer running on public funding. They have to find their own money now. Since the math of ICE deportation isn’t optimistic, we’ll have to hope that cutting off the funding that supports illegal aliens will cause a lot of them to self deport.

        I guess this is one big tumble down the staircase, as opposed to the little slips you described in your concept of a declining society.  The Great Crumbling has been going on for a while, but this scandal is a loud crash as opposed to a little slip and a groan. It reminds me of Yosemite Sam in a suit of armour bouncing down an endless staircase, accompanied by a non-stop stream of nonsense curses.I felt the same way when the Harvey Weinstein scandal occurred nearly a decade ago. There was the similar realization that everybody in Hollywood knew about it, yet it went on for years because hundreds and thousands of people were plugged into the system that benefitted from this guy’s power and influence.  But beyond that, it was the dawning awareness that what I thought I knew before might be completely bogus. All those big name stars, drawing millions of dollars for each movie – we all thought they had that fame and money because they were the best of the best. But were they? Maybe they were just the actors who were willing to pay the toll charged by the dirty troll guarding the bridge.  Maybe there were much better actors we never saw or knew about because they refused to play the game, and had to return home in defeat to Iowa or Kansas because the gate was slammed in their face.Then that scam was followed by another scam – the Believe All Women, Me Too junk that was quickly hijacked and used to persecute men, and now the whole idea of Hollywood as a factory for excellence is exploded.

            I defended Harvey — to a point — to the howls and ragings of the Cuck Commentariat at Breitbart et al.
He was chosen mostly because he looked like a cavetroll and in some respects WAS a scumbag.  I opposed scapegoating ole Harv because I knew it was a wedge that’d be used to persecute many other men.  $MeToo hastily followed.

                I have a hard time believing any of the actresses who congressed with him didn’t know what they were doing and why. His is perhaps the penultimate example of regret being redefined as rape. Did he at some point get illegally rough with some women? Probably, he is a piece of shit after all. But that doesn’t change my first point.

                    I always thought that Weinstein was cut loose to get people off the scent of what really goes on in Hollywood, particularly regarding young teenage boys. It was an open secret for years that Bryan Singer (of X-Men) fame enjoyed that sort of thing a little too much. In 2023 he fled the country for, yes, predictably, you know where.

                    My take also.
Doubt Harvey raped any of them. He was useful to them, they weren’t with him because of looks. When it became more useful to fry him for money and female solidarity, suddenly we get screams of helplessness, violation and rage. Voila! $MeToo.
To understand women, one must think of them as an international union or corporation.
But what was telling was the wrath poured out on Harv by conservatives and Christians alike. The churches are just as cucked and subjugated as the GOP and its base.

        When I consider how much is fake, astroturfed, and rigged, I consider the stock market. It doesn’t really compute that people who are intent on rigging virtually everything else to their advantage would just leave that one to fate or chance, does it? Then I note that value investing pretty well died in 2008, and that what drives the market these last few years is just a small group of stupidly overvalued stocks. Stocks that go up because they go up. “Momentum” investing, that’s called. Elon’s happens to be one of them. Or is the stock market too big for them to rig? They own the federal reserve, so I doubt that it is. (The bond market might be too big to rig though, although I’m sure they try).Which raises questions going forward. If it is that rigged, then you’d be stupid not to partake in these favored stocks. But when to get out? Rigged in perpetuity forever doesn’t really sound likely, does it? And then the prospect that “they” might rig it to go the other way if the wrong person ends up in charge.Anytime some retard says it’s impossible for large conspiracies to exist, that you can’t get that many people to keep a secret, I ask them if they’ve ever heard of the CIA.

                There is one answer.  The stock market has “insiders” and “outsiders”. Pelosi is for example, an insider.  Therefore makes money no matter which way the market goes.  One thinks that the market is invested in only by the big guys, not the little people.  Not quite true.  Given the wave of 401k’s and State pension funds and insurance companies, we have a lot of little guys in the market—most without knowledge of such.
Could it be that the market is little less than an extraction process of funds/money from the upper working class to the elites?

                    When you can’t tell what it is, it’s inflation.I don’t know the terms economists use for this stuff, because I don’t read retards’ crayon drawings, but it goes about like this:As the money supply (or fictive representation thereof) balloons, it has anorderof destinations to which it’s sent. This order is designed topay themandscrew you, reward “investing” (feeding upward) and punish non-participation (saving and spending in a traditionally sane, un-propagandized way).There’s a threshold above which numbers only go up, and below which they never do (anymore). “The market” hovers around that threshold in a way that maximizeslocalscams—the border agents’ take.To be successful, bootstrap-wise—to besmart—is toget in on it. Winners feed upward. You’re not a stupid loser, are you?

                    That’s the CAFE secret. Can’t remember what the acronym is, exactly, but the radio program in Florida that aired one show on it was shut down, the station lost their license, and the show (John &amp; Ken) had to move to Los Angeles. Certified Accounting Financial something.Anyhoo, the gist of it is, that ad hoc since ’48 and instituted as standard bylaws by ’72, is a system.A young intern was given huge stacks of paper and told to copy them. They were called “legislative law lists.” Perusing them, he realized they were the payoffs to virtually every political figure in the state, from the dogcatcher to the state Attorney General and Governor.How is this legal? Why, they’re the yield on publicly managed pools of money. The bylaws in every county state these yields must be paid out first before everything else, including the light bill. It also is the reason public union pension funds are pegged at 7 or 8 percent return without fail.In the case of a regular employee (the dogcatcher), he’s just vested, the fund is managed by the union.The higher-ups is where it gets fun.You see, every public pool of money has to bemanaged.To best achieve the greatest good, etc.It can be a public tax pool- say the road fund, school construction, or sewer maintenance- or it can be pension/benefit fund pools.Who does the managing? Why hired professional firms, of course…Except what this practice allows for, is that the public funds can beloaned,at severe discount, to certain ‘private investment groups’.Who are the ‘private investment groups’?Why, the politicians themselves.Say, a mayor or a Senator (or 2 or 3 of them) go to the professional financial management firm and say, we’d like to form a private investment group.The firm says here’s the paperwork, sign here, here, and here.The PIG can then- since they are managing the investment of the public pool- loan themselves the pool funds at say, 3%, and invest it in something- say, apartment blocks in Riverside or condos in Sydney, or towards building a proposed solar plant in Nevada or Dubai- that is projected to return 12%.As long as they pay back the loan at 3%, they are prudently investing the public’s money, while the real return remains…private.Their government status gives them the right to borrow public funds at very low cost.Every Senator has 15 or 20 of these deals on his desk every week.That’s how every politico can have a hidden byzantine empire of ‘investments’ on automatic. Or the mayor can get a piece of the Obama HUD action to build Haitian apartments in your little redneck town.It’s also why municipals invest in other municipals; all of them are broke, all of them offer junk bond rates trying to get each other’s money. Why pension funds invest in other pension funds. The Congress, like Blackrock, owns a piece of every significant corporation in America, because their PIGs manage the pension funds that invest in those stocks.Entities like USAID are also why the government doesn’t use GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles. It’s why the uni’s around DC that groom the political class teach graduate classes in things like “Interagency Finance”- departments loaning budgeted future funding to other departments- and the like.Public-private is a whole world apart from what we schlubs know about capitalism, and it all revolves around great, sloshing whirlpools of money.

            I tried to have a conversation with Grok about the Candace Owen’s revelations about Brigitte Macron and even pointing out that you can fake a lot of stuff it stuck to its heels asserting that the evidence provided officially makes the conspiracy impossible, It seems it is programmed into NPCs as well as “AI” to think no big conspiracies are possible because someone would had confessed (or the NYT would have revealed the scandal)The average mind does not notice how technically it is not natural for information to leak, someone has to know it and decide to leak it against their own interest. Most information is compartmentalized and there are bottleneck points where you can plant fake info one time and have it multiplied and have “multiple sources”. This is why democracy was never going to work.It is fun to see how the machine arranged a fake reality for so many decades to promote space IFLS retarded gay race communism

                    Emotion is quick, immediate, and distills all that cognition down to the essential summary: good or bad? Is it going to bring you positive, or pain?
Behind every simple action on my tablet, there is a library of programming in the background. We don’t have enough time to parse the million details in our social environment; every factoid is the combined result of many lines of code that required focus and attention.
Ultimately, all that focus and harnessing leads to one conclusion: good or bad for you? Shoot, why waste time, I got a ball game I wanta watch.

                I call this the death of inductive reasoning (maybe it never lived – but empiricism and its implicit deduction axioms ensured its chthonic fate). The idea of inference leading to revelation is simply impossible for the dopamine-riddled, pharmakos-doped, screen-viewing hoi polloi.

                That’s pretty obvious.  Both that the numbers are all fake and the recession since 08 at least.  (since they wouldn’t allow to crash and thus recover).   Not only zombie companies but entire zombie industries)

                    I saw a literal “zombie company” today, after a fashion. I walk dogs part-time. Sometimes if time and travel permits, we visit a “new to us” area. Today my travels took me past a large hospital that is still surrounded by mostly undeveloped fields and woods. The weather being nice, I stopped and we had a nice walk on the landscaped grounds and…to an adjacent property. That property had clearly been built as a small professional office plaza as is often found near medical facilities. I don’t know the boundaries, but the parcel was at least a few acres. You could tell where the roads had been but they were half-hidden by brush and grass. The building itself likely had never been used; at a guess it dated to the late 2000s. The windows were boarded on the inside, which didn’t stop vandals from smashing glass. A black rectangle where the door should be probably invited the occasional vagrant or other ne’er-do-well. Obviously such derelict buildings exist but in that area they are uncommon. It was a novel experience to step into one almost unawares, slightly creepy even.Of course, it’s entirely possible that the doomed project was one of the types that is discussed today.

        “You can get carried away with this, of course, and begin to question your own grasp of reality,”
You can never be too suspicious of the media, that’s for sure.  Nearly all media in the English language press is propaganda.  It doesn’t matter what the subject is about. It doesn’t matter if everything in the article is true or false. It’s all propaganda. It’s never about an attempt to inform you, it is always an attempt to persuade.

        In other words, what we have been seeing is not media bias, but an orchestrated fraud on the public.I’d have to ask: why are we even surprised at this point? It has probably been this way for even longer than any one of us remembers.Of course, the incredible gaslighting, browbeating and suppression of liberties during the Shamdemic should have been the most obvious sign. I don’t want to take away from the USAID thing, which is clearly significant… but at this point: which man with his thinking cap on is even surprised?Funny about the BBC, though. I remember my father upsetting a girlfriend of mine (a proto-leftist, I’m afraid) at our Sunday dinners when, after tuning into the BBC to hear of some ‘migrant’ crisis at our border, he’d yell: “We don’t wan’ ’em!”. It was all rather funny. Proto-leftist now likely has many cats…At the moment, my local council (yes, local council) has declared a state of Climate Emergency. What does this mean? On what basis has it been declared? Where is the hard evidence of: seas rising and swamping the coasts? People’s faces melting off due to the heat increases? Where is the tangible evidence that Every Man can see in his day-to-day existence? I don’t see anything.Our lives, our reality are increasingly disconnected from the ‘reality’ the MSM and other regime organs want us to believe. Almost every aspect of our politics is fake, and likely has been for a very long time. Perhaps in the past, men were keener to appear credible, so at least had to relate to the plebs.But it is galling to me when I encounter Every Man and he’s genuinely surprised by these revelations. Naturally, it is sometimes very difficult to know whom to trust, and perhaps one doesn’t want to go full tinfoil hat… but it’s understandable.Our eyes are our best weapon, frankly.

        The Covid response itself is an entire mass psy-op. The financial system was going tits up. What to do? Shut everything down and use the cover to print money, bail out municipal governments, airlines, and make everyone in hock to the government via PPP loans and get them used to total dependence. Well, official and overt dependence.I think the entire post WWII order was a fraud. It wasn’t a war against Communism. It was a scramble between the USSR and the GAE to take political and financial control of Europe’s colonies and manage those resources. We lost as it started when the first step of the War was to disembowel the American right, make everyone adopt egalitarianism. That thing was lie after lie after lie after lie.We lost by winning. Then there was the GWOT. We won! Except look at all the mosques everywhere, the faceplant of Christianity, the opioid crisis, the crisis of legitimacy in all institutions, the Muslim dominated towns, the Muslims in Congress who are overtly hostile to the country and publicly announce they are using America to help their home.I have a deep skepticism of the next superpower rivalry cold/warm war. That is the conflict with China. The ribbon cutting with Musk was not good. We must import Asia to defeat Asia! it pronounced. Then there is Karp running around declaring the Technological Republic flying his board to Tel Aviv, longstanding relations with them and their software community coinciding with Netanyahu’s constant drumbeating for Tel Aviv as the home of the global digital panopticon. I could go on and on and on.Whatever is left of what was America after the Cold War and the GWOT, I fear this next China rivalry is going to fully shred it. I think this third time we need to see it for what it is and take the well organized opportunist approach. We understand that it is yet another unnecessary boondoggle and that we don’t have the power to stop it. We accept that. We position ourselves to participate and profit. As central players we will have wealth, knowledge and scientific and engineering goodies that we can use to get we want when this thing strikes the final blow.The entirety of the GAE and its post WWII order is going to turn out to have been lies and mass scale fraud. Of course, there were moments of honesty like the PNAC charter … … that presented themselves along the way. We were too busy with QE bread and End Zone dance circuses to be bothered.

Maybe it was financial. But let’s not forget that Covid was used to justify all sorts of shady election practices like mail-in voting and unmonitored drop boxes. Then again, both of these theories could be true. Maybe the blob got a twofer: bail out the financial system and steal an election. Everyone wins…except the American people.

Honest people openly talk about the financial aspect. Stephanie Pomboy and Peter Theil are 2 of many who openly discuss the financial aspect of it.
Look at bond yields and the hyper-QE starting in 09/2020. There is more of that coming. Theil has openly talked about just letting the blue metros and munis fail unlike when in 2020 they were bailed out in the cover of darkness.

                In places like Lithuania the crackdown was brutal. It had little to do with the American election. It was an opportunity to break heads and teach a new generation with no memory of WW2 who was in charge. It would be nice if it were parochial, but it was a worldwide op to test some things on some folks, as Barry might’ve put it.

                Covid was also used to justify the rollout of hundreds of totalitarian, dystopian measures across the world.
It may also have been a failed part of the depop agenda. Recall the shrieking from the mass media and the best people as if we were climbing over piles of bodies to buy a gallon of milk.

                    During the lockdowns—a right-wing myth that never happened anywhere except China, who were right to do it and thereby proved they’re superior to us (“state capacity!”)—I had to pick up some equipment at a hospital. There I saw two people, the desk guard and a supply room guy. Between the two I walked the maze for minutes each way and sawno one. Every other time I’ve been there, it’s swarmed with “migrants,” with fat girls in nurse pants complexly squirming between them, trying not to touch anyone with their butts.No one.Everyone to whom the world outside TV and Twitter is real saw similar things. That’s not many people.

                    My only disagreement is that the depop agenda “failed”.
To keep from getting shot, you seperate cause from effect. A saboteur makes his hit and gets away before anyone realizes something has happened.
You seperate cause from effect by time, a time bomb.
Sterilized, with VAIDS, wide open to externals like the next shot, chemtrail dusting, EM pollution, adulterated foods and medicines- a white population already being eclipsed by the teeming masses.
They didn’t kill us. They killed our great-grandkids before they were born. None can replace us, either, except more us.

                Arthur, I hear you—but consider where we are now?  Enlightened, perhaps.  Distrustful, definitely.  Does this benefit us (Whites) in the long run to be turned into a “low trust” society.  Have we not discussed here and in the literature of the Northern European’s greatest strength as a people was in creating a high trust society?  The revelations you point to may be the final death knell to White civilization as once existed in this country.
The truth may “set us free”, but to what future?

        I would just add one other thought to this excellent piece:The need to create another Crisis to get the dollars flowing to the usual suspects is now quite pressing. They may not be able to stop DOGE, because the momentum could be irresistible, but they can gin up something big like Coof or another war.

            Probably war, as COVID-19 Part 1, Chinese Boogaloo was maybe 50% effective at scaring the public. Medicos and the pharmaceutical industry didn’t cover themselves in glory (more like something brown and disgustingly smelly) last time around and there’s enough out and out skepticism, and people talking about the awful side effects of “The Jab”, that“OHMYGODWE’REALLGONNADIEOFCOVID-20!!!!!!!!”will elicit eye rolling and a sarcastic “Really,again?” response from vast swathes of the American Public.Crack off a tactical nuke in The Ukraine before Orange Man Bad and Tesla Man can cut funding and bring parties to the negotiating table and all bets are off.

        The late Soviet analogy is quite apt, but an asterisk is in order. Remember,perestroikaandglasnostwere last-ditch efforts to preserve the system, and those came from the top down. What is unfolding in the United States is similar but it is in a way coming from outside the system. I don’t know where this ends or how it ends, but don’t discount something along the lines of a military coup and/or a stepped-up terror campaign. This is that big.Not only was the uniparty quite real, both prongs were state-funded (hello, Miss Lindsey!). The Overton Window was more than a metaphor–it was state policy. The United States literally treats is allies as vassals. The news is fake. The inflation of media consumption has been a thing a long time, as an aside, and there were numerous scandals in the print error that were discovered by the Audit Bureau of Circulation, which also was accused of fraud from time to time. The scary part of all this from an economic standpoint is the prospect of massive inflation of value of corporations and companies, particularly those that are publicly traded. This doesn’t seem going in an economic direction but do not discount it.Usually we overstate things, but in this case the temptation is to understate what is unfolding.

        In contrast to Z Man’s post today, CNN just wrote that the released transcript “refutes President Donald Trump’s assertions that CBS committed ‘election interference’.”https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/media/cbs-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview/index.html
CNN and Z Man can look at the same source material and draw contradictory conclusions. How is this possible?
Most people naturally assume that the media narratives are mostly true because it hard to believe that such a large scale conspiracy could exist for so long.
Those who control the narratives of the media are the head of the snake.

            Or, as the media parrots after every word Trump says it “‘refutes President Donald Trump’s assertions that CBS committed ‘election interference’.” WITHOUT EVIDENCE.
The coaching, primping and editing of the CBS “interview” certainly explains the popularity of the multi-hour interviews by Joe Rogan and Tucker.   Say what you will about those two, but they at least do real frigging interviews.

        ‘In other words, what we have been seeing is not media bias, but an orchestrated fraud on the public.”It’s more like garbage in garbage out. Trusted sources turning out not to be so trustworthy after all. The Kagans will be despised after all is said and done. What they were doing with the propaganda strikes at the core of what America was supposed to be about.“How many people at the BBC knew that USAID was the second largest source of funding to the BBC? Did anyone at the Financial Times know that management were on the pad?”This explains quite a lot. I’ve noticed over the years that the only real reporting about American affairs seems to come from British sources. I’m guessing these are sources who are not on the take.

Been called a conspiracy theorist (and worse) for many decades.  Rationalization was that not more than a handful of people can maintain a secret, so I must be Rong about uncomfortable facts.  Which is silly, as most of elite human history is nothing but conspiracies, sometimes kept and functional for centuries.

            Ray,You say:Which is silly, as most of elite human history is nothing but conspiracies, sometimes kept and functional for centuries.And this is a concise and excellent observation.I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been reading about some remarkable historical event, which was later found to be a complete sham. If you’d have gone back in time to tell the folks, you’d have been “conspiracy theorist” or a “witch” or something.Yet here we are… centuries later just brushing it off with the naive belief that “humanity has changed”. Elites are elites for a reason: they are exceptionally skilled manipulators, guiltless careerists and often fully Evil.

        And Pistol Pete hasn’t even started raw DOGEing the DoD yet. If you think USAID is big (which it is) then wait until Elon kicks down the doors to the Fistagon next. Because doing USAID was an opening attack on an outpost of GloboHomo. I don’t think we have seen the main attack yet.

                I think it might be that, and also the BOM needing to get all his loyalists in place at the top of the disloyal Apparat so he can hit them all at once with a coordinated assault. Think of it like a combined arms offensive-so while the shitbag generals and admirals are being hit frontally by Pistol Pete, they get attacked by a swarm of DOGEs, the Bondi agents, and anyone else able to take a shot from any other angle. Because they absolutely must know that the DoD and the “intelligence” community are the most dangerous enemies, but also the toughest. If you hit weaker opponents first, it will uncover things they can use to destroy the biggest enemies, because their secrets are not so well defended.

                    That’s definitely the sequencing, yes. I also imagine they have a very accurate and detailed list of who will prove particularly troublesome if the MIC grift gets threatened and needs to be removed. Touching the MIC aspect is far more fraught with danger than exposing DOE graft, and we probably underestimate the probability of an outright coup due to the extent of corruption.

            The plandemic should have been that moment, if such a thing were possible. There’s a whole lot of denial about this USAID business, just pretending that it’s not happening. Or twisting it around. In my msm news feed this morning, the top story was how Ivanka used USAID funds to get some sound equipment for an event she was throwing at the WH.

            The US has been in a slow motion collapse since the 1970s.  The collapse of the Roman Empire took centuries.  The Soviet Union is where people like to draw inspiration, but it wasn’t an economic collapse so much as it was a political collapse.  I heard McGreggor say the Soviets came to the US people on the ground and told them “we want to be a normal country again, no more communism”  Economics certainly played a role, as did the ridiculous war in Afghanistan (the idea they would turn Afghanistan into an atheistic communist country was absurd), but it was primarily a political collapse.  Sadly, as soon as the USSR collapsed, everything the communists warned would happen, happened.Perestroika likely played a role as well.  I’ve watched some reports from the era and Perestroika was a total disaster.  They needed to rely on the state owned enterprises for supplies and parts.  Like there was a home and apartment builder who couldn’t get wood or bricks or other construction material at any price.

        One of Dandy Dan’s favorite tag lines is “no matter how much you hate the MSM, it’s not enough!” To which I ask  . . . is hating them enough? Or is it our duty to do more than that? If you spot some large miscreant oaf sucker punching a little old lady on the street, does your social obligation stop at outrage? If you see a van full of suspicious characters attempting to sweep up a small child off the sidewalk, does your responsibility end at yelling “stop you fiends?” How bad does it have to get before indignation alone becomes insufficient?

        The sports gambling issue figures to go off like an atomic bomb at some point.  ESPN is airing a new pro golf simulator league called TGL.  It features two teams of pros in an indoor arena hitting shots into a simulator.  The first two matches were blowouts and the third was very close.  One of the players said in his post match interview the producer told them to “keep it close” this time.  Even though people are betting on these matches, this is getting passed off as a joke. The NBA has already had two scandals of marginal players fixing prop bets on the number of points they would score in the game. The obvious reaction would be to stop taking bets on things that can be easily fixed with low level players, since this is an industry with no sense of restraint, they won’t do that.

            I used to think this because the big sports leagues (certainly the NBA/NFL — not sure about the others) have been rigged for a long time, and now they and the sports media companies are all hopelessly dependent on the gambling dollars to continue to “grow”.
However, I am reminded we live in a very corrupt age, and maybe sports are now viewed by fans/gamblers the same way so-called “crypto-currency” is viewed by “investors”: They all know it is a scam, but everyone keeps quiet so long as they themselves retain a (small) shot at winning big.

                Fan interest has really shifted as the average fan is more concerned with winning money than closely following a favorite team or player. Of course a super majority of them lose almost all the time.  If gambling was restricted in serious ways, interest in pro sports could completely collapse.

        The grifter that eats its tail should be the symbol of the ‘west’, or what was the west I guess. Another issue with the whole ‘value’ is that now it’s pretty much linked to attention and drama-based ‘content’, which has no real value to anyone or society. But it does to the blob. Hence, the ‘critical drinker’ is just another grifter who feeds off the anger of Western males to pay his bills, much like the cuckservatives have on their base. Nobody has any value anymore. It’s a big circle jerk until people willingly forget they are part of the lie that feeds them. Nothing against the ‘culture bros’ but their value is entirely based on DIE remaining in culture. Don’t think they want to get back to being working-class.

        On one hand, the depth and scope of the crime is a surprise. On the other, it’s not.It does explain something I have noticed in various circles over the years. Some of the most ‘successful’ people I have met, with the metrics being $$$, are some of the DUMBEST. Most childlike.Funny how their ‘success’ still ends up with divorces, drug-addicted children, and every other pathology of current years. It seems they have one ‘special needs’ or ‘gay’ child PER family.I will say that said ‘successful’ people never work in trades where they have to break a fingernail. Private Equity, whatever that really is, seems to attract some of the dumbest. Like the guy that lives in the $1.2 million home that is stumped by how to open the hood of his car.

        Regarding everything being fake I remember being forced to watch American foot and balls game with some obligate normies a while back and I was musing whether or not the games are rigged.  It was striking just how offended the normies got from my suggestion that their goyslop was tainted somehow.  Same with that Tyson fight where both boxers seemed to be pulling their punches.

            I suggested to a bartender just last night – loud enough that I could be heard by many if not all, mind you! – that the NFL was “crooked,” and might well be “rigged, though and through.”The looks I got were interesting: some of these were “how dare you!”, and some were “You’re hip to the idea, too, eh?”The bartender nodded in agreement with me.

        Have we reached the point where we can now admit that “grug brain normies” had a point and that “voting harder” actually had its merits AND in fact Trump was very unlike the other guys AND that who is president turned out to be extremely consequential in this case AND AND AND… basically that all the super smart guys on the right were wrong about a whole lot of stuff?Or are we going to be the wine aunt with the mask on in 2025 to get booster number 12?Not to dunk on anyone, but insisting you were and are always right is a trap best avoided.  The DNC is coming from the last election with more land aknowledgments and pronoun lists because that’s what they’ve learned… have WE learned anything from recent events?I see a lot of doomer black pillers quadrupling down on the idea that nothing has happened and that this was all according to plan… but MAYBE its just easier for them to deny the plain significance of events then admit that maybe they overstated their case a smidge…

            You look at one election, 2024 and one candidate—Trump.  Yet ignore much of anything else that refutes your assertion that voting counts, or rather elections are fair or meaningful in the positive sense.  Voting in my State is still suspect, still denied by the courts, and has put in officials by slim and questionable margins.But perhaps most notably, you assume Trump is a successful president and that he is making a change.  Way too soon to write the history of his presidency.  I note to that effect his new trial balloon that we undertake to handle the Palestinians problem in Gaza, thereby ridding Israel of their problem.

            I’m partial to the idea that the ascendant/breakaway oligarchy backing Trump (which is plain to see, and who btw weren’t backing him in 2020) have enough juice to put the kibosh on “most” of the election rigging. When they want to. That yes voting may matter, but only when they decide it does.

            It is rigged and almost hopeless but if you can win you can do stuff, which is why it is in the interest of every black-piller and bitter non voter to back a Republican House candidate in November 2026 and help keep the majority onside with the administration.It doesn’t make sense to hobble a guy like Trump because you have some sort of nihilistic principles – stop being a selfish fer for a moment and think through the chain of causation.

            Reminds me of my dear old mom. She distrusted the government. yadda-yadda.
Comes the jab party, TRUST ON 110%. Stops jabbing after 3, trust off.
I asked her recently, the dear 80 year old, “why” did she suddenly trust again?
Simply, “I was afraid.”
Fear trumped her ability to think, even though she had the script right until the big jab propaganda campaign came. Regained her senses later.

        Here comes the Sun…So I just now listened to the Trump-Netanyahu presser.America will colonize Israel. A Riviera on the East Med. Basically a playground for America’s ruling elite…the technoelite backing Trump.The 51st state, the 2nd Federal District- Distrito Globál, the 13th Federal Reserve District.A hub to rival the City of London, parked at the confluence of the Belt trade routes, an alternative Bosphorus.Knock WWII OSS mummies like USAID out of the way to kneecap the neocon industry and switch over to a Belt strategy instead, just like China / BRICS.Seperate two snarling dogs, kennel one, throw a bone to the other.Send ’em back to Jordan and pay the Hashemites for the favor, like a Sinai accord.Build some stuff there too, let them be a maquiladora economy for the Arabs like Palestine was for the Israelis.Set the boy-buggering mullahs in Iran back and let Arab greed take over, with pictures of Dubai dancing in their heads.Now that AI is being unleased on the next colossus of fake and gay, the academics, what’s next, the propaganda industry itself? The system of corruption inside the political class? The neocon war money machines?Since Judaic perfidy and Western hypocrisy are being highlighted- accepted and adjusted for in the common moral understanding- what else will lose its strident urgency? Who will we stop believing next?The inability to force a kneejerk reaction means we start acting like adults instead of paying attention to people who sound like hysterical 13 year-old girls, be they Netanyahu, Kier Starmer, or Chuckie Schumer.Screw the moral consensus being set by conniving liars.That, I think, is the primal Judaic value we whites have to get ourselves rid of.

        “The vast amounts of fraud in the economy support millions of mortgage payments and college tuition bills, so the people benefiting from the organized fraud will not go quietly.”Part of this is a consequence of the outsourcing of the American industrial economy. The jobs sent elsewhere have been replaced with government jobs. The older people who were no longer employable (fifty somethings) but not yet eligible for SS/Medicare were put on disability for minor ailments (a covert  unemployment program). Many of the jobs left are low-paying or filled by legal and illegal immigrants. Cutting the government jobs and eliminating disability for minor stuff is going to create a large class of unemployable people and significant economic chaos. Of course they won’t go quietly. We will see in drastic clarity the foolishness of the geniuses who outsourced the once dynamic American economy.

        Simple as this:
Screw the moral consensus being set by conniving liars.That, I think, is the primal Judaic feminine value we whites have to get ourselves rid of.Who will we stop believing next?
Faced with an onslaught of mis-, dis-, and mal-information, what do we do?Try to cut through the fog of culture war, using combined effort as best we can…exactly what we’re doing now in the meme wars.
This is such a positive sign that whites are reorienting and adjusting to the new conditions, it’s like rays of sunshine, like dawn ready to break.

        I liked Zman’s points about the potential gaming of the streaming minute numbers by Netflix and others.
Those points fit into my recent thoughts about the proliferation of bots and AI slop from all the digital parrots out there.
I think the proliferation of all that slop is actually dragging us down, potentially even fulfilling, “Dead Internet,” theory.

        Something else fake &amp; (literally) gay is the publishing business. Before the e-book revolution, critics and organizations like the NYT “Bestseller” List could pick the winners and the gatekeepers in tradpub froze out any non-leftist white heterosexual male not already grandfathered in.The new gatekeepers are mostly Amazon algorithms. They shine favor on some authors who come out of nowhere and get 2,000 reviews the first month, and the momentum keeps their book visible to potential readers for decades. Other authors’ books are immediately buried where they can’t be found by anybody except by following a link or searching for the exact title and author name (and even then they’ll be shown other books first). Then Amazon goes through periodically and nukes their 5-star reviews.It’s not about quality. The system elevates mediocrity, while hiding brilliance.
