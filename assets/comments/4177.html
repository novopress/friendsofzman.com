        I have a feeling Veterinary type health care for Americans would be just fine with Obama. Best not to give him any ideas.

        I’m not prepared to give credit to Europeans for accepting rationing, and in truth  the American socialists elite fully anticipate rationing. They love rationing–the rationing of others. Major bonus points for pulling the plug. Nothing can save a centralized health system so much money as removing unproductive citizens from an unproductive system. There is some long German word for that. Maybe one of your readers knows it.
Veterinary medicine is a winner in demonstrating the way forward for health care to the uninformed, the misinformed, and even the malformed.

        In the UK we are told — very firmly told — that we have the best healthcare model in the world. The politicians insist we believe it, even though there is little evidence our NHS is copied anywhere else.In fact healthcare is the greatest single factor in any general election. In early May we go to the polls again (my, how five years passes so swiftly) and all the things that worry the population — or at least the sensible, able to vote sector of Britain — will largely be ignored in favour of trumped up ‘crises’ such as global warming and of course, the NHS. All the main political parties support the NHS, each promising to outdo the other. Better targets for care, improved waiting times, greater accessibility, more cleanliness… the arguments spin like a cloud of gnats on a summer evening.Certainly once the NHS was started after WWII it has increasingly become the sole magnet for discussion at every end and turn. When the Chancellor presented his budget the other day Labour rounded on him for ‘not mentioning the NHS.’ It might be perceived that all the commitments were already there to the NHS but Labour desperately wanted something to beat Osborne with. Cameron then came out with a promise for an improved 7 day a week access to the NHS for all (yes, including all the health tourists who fly in for an operation or to have a baby and then flee back to their own homeland at the first chance, before any money changes hands). Thus healthcare provision dominates everything here, but then as the nation’s largest employer (and favourite toy of the unions) it matters so much to many.When you launched Obamacare I thought then that all you were doing was bringing a major debate into your politics — one that will eventually eclipse all else. Eventually like our NHS arguments — and all claim to love it more than anything — it will despite of any other pressing issue, become the one football to be kicked around by all sides, in every way, all the time. It will dominate your political discourse. Billions will be pumped in, billions more promised, billions of words issued about it.Will your people be healthier? Will they ever be satisfied? Only time will tell, though time tends to have one medical outcome whatever happens.

            Two things we have going for us in the States. One is we have 15% of the population who make demands on the other 85% that can never be met. This anchor population tends to sink all socialist projects within a generation. The other thing is we really suck at socialism. It really is incredible just how awful we are even the most modest schemes.In that regard, diversity is our strength. Socialism works fine within kin groups. The Scandinavians could make it work when it was just them nestled up there near the arctic. Now that they are importing lunatics the whole thing will fall apart into an ethnic spoils system. That’s what you see in America.With regards to ObamaCare, we may have caught an additional break by having it designed by a committee of our least fit citizens.
