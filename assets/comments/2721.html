        Section 1 scares me the most Z-man.  It enshrines democracy and political equality (whatever that means) as the cornerstone of American government rather than representative government and federalism. The words “democracy” and “democratic” currently appear nowhere in the Constitution or its amendments.
Making the U.S. a democracy is always the goal.

        No need exists to repress what is already the most effective propaganda arm of the Cathedral, but the internet on the other hand is a vexing problem indeed, or, at the very least, a constant source of embarrassment.
An eloquent Republican (I kid) would connect the dots for the millenials, who are outraged, however incoherently, over the talk of abridging their rights to read or publish. But I expect that the left will in time be successful in spinning the issue for them, because they are already children of the left.

        That’s cute: It doesn’t give congress the power to abridge the freedom of the press, but it does give congress the power to arbitrarily define who’s included in “the press”.

        At what point does the USA collapse from this fiddling with the machinery of government and culture?
