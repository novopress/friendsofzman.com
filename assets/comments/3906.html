        Western civilization needs to lose the skirt and gird itself for the battle ahead. The suicide of the West has been a slow-moving thing, but has definitely picked up speed the last 10 years or so. Among the many things that Islam is, and they are all negative, is a culture annihilator. Aside from the horrific cost in human lives, witness the destruction of ancient artifacts from museums in Mosul. How many people know that this is par for the course for Islam. That the pyramids of Giza were once covered in beautiful polished, white limestone, visible from miles away. Until the Moslems decided they’d take it to build mosques, leaving the pyramids looking like sandstorm victims.No, this will not end well, but it will end. Lots of blood on both sides will be spilled. Better theirs than ours, but we want to learn the lesson of multiculturalism the hard way, apparently.

        Yes, Z-man. We had a bad storm in 1929 and it vomited up  the worst ideas in politics front and center, permanently. The tremendous accumulated force of liberty adapted to these new constraints for a time, but now that ghost of liberty too is failing. Tocqueville wrote that Europeans who arrived in China were surprised to see an advanced industrial nation in contrast with the unusually static Chinese quality of mind. “The Chinese, in following the path of their ancestors, had mislaid the reasons for the direction the latter had chosen. They still used the formula without asking why; they kept the tool but they had lost the skills to adapt or replace it. The Chinese were, therefore, not able to change anything and had to abandon any notion of improvement. The well of human knowledge had dried up and although the flow still ran, it could neither increase its volume nor change its course.We should not, therefore, complacently think that the barbarians are still far away for, if some nations allow the torch to be snatched from their hands, others stamp it out themselves.”Edmund Burke said if you tell him the opinions of your young people he will tell you the future of your nation.

        Until fairly recently I lived in Rotherham: yes, that place in Britain where the muslim immigrants are free to do what they want to young white girls. It wasn’t a nice feeling living there, but you knew that no matter what the muslims did and said, no one would gainsay them. They knew they were as good as untouchable because the ruling party there has decreed there must be no racism (though I do know of one instance where a Chinese couple took their daughter to a ‘multi-cultural’ nursery and the muslim women there made it very clear this was their place and Chinese weren’t welcome. Naturally, this was not going to be deemed racism.)I know of some of the things that went off in Rotherham but in case the Oberführers who run British society decide to track my IP it is best for me to keep quiet. Going after soft targets like naughty whites who don’t like the unfettered immigration of tribal hordes who have little intention of integrating is far easier than telling bearded brown men not to interfere with young white girls. So, as I don’t wish to be put in jail and made to eat Halal meat with all the rest of the dissenters, I will stay quiet.What I will say is that Britain’s leaders have betrayed their country. i used to think it was just Labour, who have long been notorious for saying they will protect the working man and then doing things to destroy the class. I am sure hypocrisy is natural to socialists, but the way Labour — who once actively sought to help the Communist world piss on the west — engineered a massive and divisive social change that meant jobs would go to low-paid immigrants rather than Brits is appalling. Worse though is the continuing action of the Tories, who even after 13 years of destructive socialism under Blair and Brown still needed the support of the yap-dog Liberal Democrats (who were spawned as a spin off by disgruntled Labour people) to govern the country could hardly have been worse.Cameron still trots out the line that islam is peace, and when he spoke in public about Britain — which he all but broke with his stupid Scottish independence referendum — one day having muslim prime minister the last vestige of hope for the nation faded. Britain, for all its many faults, is not muslim but we cannot work out why our leaders insist it isa good idea.It is easy to talk of multi-culture and say the nation is a melting pot (not helped by the idiot Charles saying he must defend all faiths), but increasingly the evidence points to a disaffected, and growing bolder, group in the midst of society who have no interest in being multi-culti at all.This, as you say, will not end well. The police are effectively powerless (Robert Peel were he alive would be horrified at their ineffectiveness and lack of moral strength) and the military is daily reduced. Russia flies its bombers near our coasts and our pitiful airforce couldn’t cope with more than one or two arriving intent on destruction. Our leaders are supine, selfish and greedy and eagerly take orders from the EU who regards nations as out-of-date and insist we dismantle our borders. Oh yes, and we pay a lot to be a member of a club that doesn’t like us.Before I left Rotherham I saw a trio of blonde white girls with a bunch of teenage muslim males, lounging on the grass of the main park. The girls were giggling and clearly awe-struck by these foul-mouthed young men and as much as I wanted to say to them to stay away from these males, it would have been too much for me to confront a dozen — possibly drugged up and perhaps knife-carrying — younger males to make a scene. I would be accused, horror of horror, asa racist. So I stayed out of the way. Yes, I was a coward, and the fate of those girls was regretfully nothing to do with me. But I have told the females in my family to keep away from muslim males. Alas, a lot of them in Rotherham drive taxis so a lot of women have to be alone with them…Are they all evil? No. of course not. I knew some who were absolutely fine, but i always suspected in the end they have to go with what their faith tells them. But the ones who are evil can get away with it, and that is troubling. Sure, a handful of arrests are made every so often, but the local girl who was arrested for trying to confront one of the men who had raped her some time earlier is a sobering reflection on what South Yorkshire police do to protect the tribes. Another girl made it clear that she still sees the men who assaulted her driving round with young white girls in their vehicles. She may as well scream into a gale-force wind. Nothing will be done, many believe.In short, there appears to be no justice and no will to bring justice back to British society.The London girls who went to Syria to be part of the murderous death cult out there may well end up as some sort of young wife to a crazed killer or two, but I was amused when I heard one observer say that those muslim males who get young muslim girl for sex will be disappointed they didn’t get even younger white girls, as apparently are freely available in the UK. Cynical view, I am sure, but maybe not without a glimmer of truth.The continuing story of ‘radicalised’ muslims pops up in the UK media as if each time this is something remarkable, but it isn’t anything to do with that. It is muslims just being muslims and following the call of their faith. To imagine they can and will do anything else is preposterous. No one will stop them, no one in the upper echelons of power will confront this.I doubt if UKIP — routinely portrayed as racist and bigoted by the MSM — can ever form a government. They exist asa gesture of fading defiance. Labour, Tories and the pathetic Limp Dumbs are united in their allegiance to Europe and the EU has decided these islands aren’t worth saving.it will not end well here but it may end one day in some way or other. Pray it does not cost too many lives.

            UKer, great post. It’s comforting for some on the right to look at all of this as a gathering storm. That assumes some conflagration in which these things are sorted and possible put right again. That’s not what’s happening. We are witnessing the lights going out on Western Civilization. It was a good run, but now it is ending.

        You are absolutely right.  Unfortunately I cannot name a politician who will boldly state the truth.  Not only is western civilization under attack but more specifically white people are the eye of the target.  Yet we have no leader to champion our cause.  How bad will it get before white rage erupts and reigns hell-fire?  You know we have done it before and will do it again when necessary.  I just wish it were not necessary.
