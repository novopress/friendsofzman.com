        It is not disturbing that people believe the “religion of peace” tripe, it is that few people seem to have the gonads to speak up and denounce it, when almost everyone with a brain, including Muslims, knows exactly what is going on.We Americans gave been trained to politely look away or mumble agreement when the crazies, supposedly representing some significant, downtrodden group of people, go off and say or do the most idiotic things.  I hope that someday, soon, people will find the nerve to push back, firmly and persistently.  We cannot go on like this.  Most people, deep down, know better.  They just have been trained to not let on.

        Islam is an interloper, and a fairly recent one.  The Middle East was pagan and Christian for 700 years before the Muslims buzzed out of their sandy hive.  It was pagan for 1000’s of years before that.  Palestine (named by the Roman conquerors after they destroyed the temple and scattered the Jews) was a Jewish homeland since around 1300 BC.  Constantinople was the center of the Eastern Greek Empire up until, what, the 15th century?Of course we are at war with Islam.  They are certainly at war with us.  In fact, the West was at war with the East long before the arrival of Islam.  Just ask the Greeks.  Does Jonah Goldberg read?  Does he remember Salamis?  Of course not.  And he’s the best Conservative Inc. has to offer.In a sense, the Greco-Persian Wars made the West.  When it ended, the Greeks turned on each other, and destroyed themselves.  There is nothing better than a genuinely threatening foreign menace to focus a civilization.
