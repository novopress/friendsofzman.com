        The red link under ‚Äúcasualties‚Äù goes to an ant-Putin site that, tellingly, does not appear to maintain a count of Ukrainian casualties to compare it with. I suppose you linked to it for the bar graph of monthly Russian casualties but is there any reason to take that graph seriously?

        OT:
So, after seeing the airport psy-op go down in Dagestan, I did a 5 minute Wiki search about this obscure region of the globe:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan
Here is the money quote from Wiki:
‚ÄúWith 14 official languages, and 12 ethnic groups each constituting more than 1% of its total population, the republic is one of Russia‚Äôs most linguistically and ethnically diverse, and one of the most heterogeneous administrative divisions in the world.‚Äù
This should make it crystal clear that the controllers do not seriously believe that DIE-versity is any kind of strength.

            I wonder how much time Vladimir Putin has spent studying ‚Äú200 Years Together‚Äù.
Do you suppose Putin has ever watched ‚ÄúFiddler on the Roof‚Äù from the beginning to the end? [Is there a DVD with Russian subtitles?]
I wonder if Putin can play a piano-two-hands version of ‚ÄúAnatevka‚Äù [under-worked over-fed Anatevka]?

        ‚ÄúThe result is Ukraine becomes an economic, demographic, and social catastrophe.‚Äú
So basically where they were before the war started, minus 500,000 of their population (dead) and quite a few more who fled the country as refugees.
It‚Äôs a shame we can‚Äôt hang the people responsible.

            For reference, the Ukraine had a population of approximately 51MM when the Soviet Union collapsed. The most recent population estimate I have seen for the Ukraine is 23MM, and the population is heavily skewed toward the elderly. The young people have left or are dead. The Ukraine will not exist in a matter of years.

                Even with short term and the recent hike in interest rates, I suspect you‚Äôd be losing quite a bit to the (unofficial, actual) inflation rate.

                    Serious question: is it possible to beat real inflation at all?
You‚Äôd probably have to make 15% on investments to stay even with real inflation. Pretty difficult in today‚Äôs environment. Probably your only two options are to get screwed dry, or screwed with lube.
Even Buffet is big on Treasuries right now.

                        My theory is: stay invested in legitimate companies that make needed things. They should eventually be able to raise prices to the new levels and their shares rise in return. McDonalds (maybe not a good example, but probably IS an inelastic commodity) just had a good quarter. Haha Its the Zman investment blog

        I think one of the most important questions The Regime must answer in regard to Ukraine is when the next Year Zero emerges what will Wikipedia and the Propaganda Ministries need to change Kiev, oops, I mean Kyiv to?Btw, does someone here know the story behind Kiev vs. Kyiv? Is this some subtle aspect of conquest related to the ethnic rivalries that have been going on there for centuries?Curious to know what this is all about.I personally don‚Äôt like the Keeeev of Kyiv. It sounds like the speaker is constipated. How about something phonetic that the New Americans who will be rising in The Regime to pull fire alarms, neck roll, cuss and finger wag with press-on nails can easily understand how to pronounce: Keeyev.

        All interesting theories about Ukraine and, uh, Reasons.But The Only Thing that got us into the Ukraine, and keeps us there is Zelensky, et al blackmailing Biden and other Congressional types that they will spill the beans on all of the corruption, money and kickbacks that flowed from Ukraine to the USA if they didn‚Äôt get military aid and lots of it. It‚Äôs not about Nuland or any of those lightweight clowns and their so called statecraft. It was keeping the Ukraine money laundromat a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù.

                    Except that we have myriad vidyas of Tater Joe tweaking the nipples of pre-pubescent girls prior to the emergence of ChatGPT Deep Fakes.
Heck, his own daughter admitted that her diary was real, not fake.
Although the question of the Venn Diagram intersection of pederasty and embezzlement is quite fascinating.
The two circles do seem to line up just about perfectly.

                I‚Äôm extremely cynical/pessimistic/etc., but I have only one true black-pill opinion: Nobody is blackmailed. Our leaders ‚Äúbetray‚Äù us because they hate us and want to hurt us. They don‚Äôt need to be extorted into it. No exceptions‚Äîbecause they are literally *never* accountable to us.When ‚Äúour‚Äù guys like DeSantis and Rumpswabby suddenly reverse engines and go neocon, it‚Äôs not because they were shown pictures of themselves with child prostitutes. It‚Äôs because our approval of them has reached a tipping point where it becomes too disgusting for them to accept‚Äîwhere it so threatens their self-image as a species separate from us, they can‚Äôt even ‚Äúgrift‚Äù anymore.Epstein wasn‚Äôt running a Mossad honeypot. He was a pimp who shared our rulers‚Äô fetish for defiling the livestock. If he kept video (from whom do we ‚Äúknow‚Äù that he did?) he kept it to *watch*.

                    The Epstein Mossad connection seems pretty well founded. It‚Äôs ironic that your only black pill opinion as you call it, is one that probably can‚Äôt withstand scrutiny. Because there‚Äôs a lot of blackmail going around. It may not be necessary to motivate them but it is effective at controlling them.

            There is only so much stupidity that can be bought from crooked politicians ‚Äì who NEED some popularity to maintain their positions. Blackmail is the only explanation that makes sense at this point.Zelensky should be seriously worried about his skin at this point, and he‚Äôs crooked as hell. Putin should offer him an out: a safe place to live and a billion dollars, in return for telling the tale of how he influenced his way i into Nato support for his massively stupid war.Getting crooks to distrust each other shouldn‚Äôt be hard. Such revelations would make the idiot machinations of our ruling grifters much harder in the future, and maybe embarass some of the worst garbage out of office, and off of Russia‚Äôs back.

        Is anyone else beginning to get the feeling (or already knew?) the entire Gaza op was planned to bring the evangelicals back to the regime‚Äôs side and improve recruiting in traditional geographic areas?
The airbridge that was immediately established to Our Greatest Ally is a sickening waste of time and resources, but you‚Äôve got multiple preachers howling for even more.
Also, given the way the regime is flying the wings off their aircraft, I‚Äôd love to be a fly on the wall at various hangars around the empire. Aircraft maintenance has got to be an unbelievably interesting field right now.

            The evangelical leadership seems to revel in their support for the war.  Its all black and white, ‚Äúus‚Äù against terrorists and baby-killers.  There are now prayers for Israel invoking the formulaic verses from the OT, candle-light vigils, and Israeli flags.  Gone is any universal call to the gospel.  What‚Äôs a Christian to do nowadays?

        ‚Äú This rather frank story from Time hints that the army is no longer following orders from the government. ‚ÄùThis brings back memories from the Vietnam conflict.  After the Tet offensive and the war dragging into the early 70‚Äôs, there were news reporters embedded who began to let the cameras role and document the *direct* disobedience of front line troops.  For example, a platoon filmed openly changing/ignoring patrol orders such that they did not travel into areas they considered dangerous wrt VC forces.  Of course, the media was against the war by that time, so they were happy to broadcast such disobedience and morale problems in the field.  LBJ shortly thereafter announced that the war was to be turned over to the South Vietnamese and America was in essence getting out.Zelenskyy of course is no LBJ and I guess he‚Äôs in it to keep his ass out of jail or worse  receive the (deserved) fate of a Ceau»ôescu.

        The hardest thing for modern whites to understand is ethnic solidarity. It is utterly an alien concept to most of us. We may have had this prior to WW2, but it‚Äôs been lost because of reasons we all know well.We‚Äôre entering a phase where the sons of immigrants are taking charge. They all grew up in 80% white America, and have a chip on their shoulder; they probably have a racism story or two, either of themselves or their parents. But they don‚Äôt hate white people as I‚Äôm sure most of them had very positive experiences, and on some level they understand that they fled their brown home for a white one.The difference is they were brought up with certain ethnic inculcations (as were the likes of Andrew Yang and Michelle Wu) and their race was likely a driving force‚Ä¶not necessarily to replace whites, but to compete along with them. ‚ÄúCompete‚Äù being the operative word, as whites don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre competing with anyone racially, just meritocratically. So Indians and Chinese compete with Jews and whites and everyone else, while whites compete with performance metrics.What will happen when the grandsons of immigrants take charge, and the country is 50% white? Will they still have the memory of their ancestors rescuing them from their brown home, and being surrounded by nice color-blind whites? Or will they see us as just another ethny to compete with‚Ä¶like a prison yard?

        A protracted war of attrition in Ukraine is in Russia‚Äôs interest as it will continue to bleed NATO of money, weapons and willpower.We have to consider that the Russians may be employing the same strategy against GloboHomoZOG as Reagan employed against them in Afghanistan. They know that the U.S.is almost $34 trillion in debt, inflation is running high, weapons reserves are running low, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is almost empty, Army recruitment is low, and the genderqueer/non-binary Navy keeps running ships aground or into each other.As BRICS abandons the petrodollar the U.S. will likely face a financial, military, and political crisis not unlike what happened in the USSR in the 1980s. If the Russians keep the pressure up it will accelerate the denouement of the West.

            That sounds realistic. Although I think Putin worries about China who would be the biggest winner here. Russia and China are not the happy couple they make it seem. I think Russia is China‚Äôs only neighbor that it does not have an active border dispute with and that is only because they have agreed to out it on ice while both are being threatened by GAE.

            I don‚Äôt think there is anything to suggest that Russias goal is to bleed NATO. In fact they were likely blindsided by the western response to their initial invasion. Had Russian leadership known this was the outcome they would have probably gone for the kill in the beginning or not have done it at all.Putin is different from western leadership in that he seems to be very aware of the limits of the Russian state and its military. The Russian war strategy relies on keeping Chinese trading partners (the global south) at least agnostic, thereby allowing the Chinese room to continue supplying Russia.Lots of the Z comment section makes the Russian government out to be more than it actually is. Russia is definitely not satisfied with how the war is going, but they‚Äôre navigating it as best they can under the circumstances.

                My guess is that Putin is playing a defensive game and is secretly cursing his bad luck that the West has gone certifiable. Because that means he is squeezed between a western nutjob and an ice cold cynical Beijing. Both much bigger in population and money than old mother Russia. Those scary new sarmat missiles and other hardware are ostensibly pointed at us (because our slavers are crazy). But Putin doesn‚Äôt mind that Beijing notices them as well.

                You‚Äôre failing to take into account that the West wanted Ukraine (and Georgia) to join NATO well before the Russian invasion. NATO has been expanding continually for the past 30 years despite the absence of the Soviet threat and in violation of the promises made to the Yeltsin-era Russian Federation.Putin was not blindsided, he knew exactly what he was doing. He was trying to send a message to NATO that he would fight back against their continued aggression. I agree that he probably would have preferred a decisive victory to put some fear into NATO, but failing that his strategy is to avoid an escalation of the war, while simultaneously bleeding NATO of weapons and money.

        The interesting untold story of Ukraine is that expatriation is once again ramping up in a big way. When they started mobilizing women (and actually sending them to the front), this triggered another exodus wave and now there is hardly anyone left to keep their society running while the war rages. And if this winter becomes as cold and dark as expected, an uprising against the Zelensky regime is a very real possibility. In other words, we could witness the first national collapse event in Europe within a few months. And if so, this will be instructive as to how things may play out elsewhere should the dominoes continue falling.A perfect storm is brewing. The West is bankrupt and can no longer afford to fund foreign wars. The ticking timebomb of rising interest rates means sovereign debt can no longer be rolled over. Diversity migration has infested Western countries with a resident infection that explodes when the gibs stop flowing. And Israel is primed to initiate WW3, which the Globalist Elites regard as being a good thing. They genuinely believe that their Jackboots will win the day and enable tyranny to arise.And then the drones appear, and ‚ÄúOh shit‚Äù happens.

            Is it that simple?
Interest rates.Compound interest rates.
Disregarding the oogily-boogily I subscribe to, they destroy every society that grants them influence.
Is it a ‚Äúone weird trick‚Äù?Hucksters promise a something something‚Ä¶
Do they simply bankrupt societies?
When the compounding exceeds the liquidity, the gears of that society freeze up or grind to a halt.
Leveraging, the greatest strength of a permanent minority, may have a hard, hard limit.

            This war  has been a well orchastrated progrom to kill off the ukrainian men , and drive the ukrainians from their farmland. It‚Äôs some of the best in the world.The added ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù is that it has freed up ukrainian woemen and children to be trafficked to brothels all from pakistan to Egypt. very profitable and satisifing for some.The women and children  not trafficked will be spending their time in the refugee centers in europe.

            Hopefully the Poles learned their lesson in 1939. They were told they would be protected if they refused to solve the Danzig problem with Germany. They believed them and got invaded from 2 different directions and suffered from that mistake for 50 years.

        If what Z says is at all accurate, it again raises the question that‚Äôs ben asked before: What‚Äôs in it for Ukraine? What was ever in it for Ukraine other than, perhaps, a vain fantasy of revenge for the Soviet treatment of the Kulaks and maybe the revanchist hopes of Ukrainian Nazis? Ukraine, no less than Poland, is a lovely East/West battleground, but the Poles, for all their troubles, haven‚Äôt volunteered to be human shields for NATO‚Äôs incursions against the ‚ÄúSlavic/Eurasian hordes on the modern equivalent of horseback.‚ÄùTight, highly placed cabals may be willing to sell their people for a song ‚Äî some of that seems to be happening here ‚Äî but evening old scores is hardly worth the price of courting self-destruction one would think.

            Ukrainian politics are every bit as convoluted and deranged as Middle Eastern politics. One camp is the oligarchs, who have been greatly diminished by this war, but who threw in with Washington thinking Russia was weak. They backed Zelensky and tolerated the ultranationalists, who brought manpower to the project. Then you have the ultranationalists who are consumed by a hatred of Russia and dreams of a national socialist Ukraine. They thought they could win the war in the Donbas, then push Zelensky aside. The moderates who wanted to cut a deal with Russia thought they could also cut a deal with the West.On top of that you have the military that was getting showered with money from NATO. The secret police were getting lots of help from Washington and London. There evolved an army of NGO‚Äôs in Lviv and Kiev hiring locals to do the bidding of Western interests. Throw in minority interests in Carpathia, Odessa and, of course, the Donbas, and you end up with an incoherent political landscape that was easy for Washington to exploit.I suspect that all but the nationalist regret making that deal with the devil known as the neocons. The current political leadership surely knows they will not outlive this conflict. They The army leadership has known for a long time how this war will end, but they have had no choice in the matter.

                Thats a good analisys of the players and priorities of the ukrainians. they were ripe for the coup. Given how many layers from the top down the corrution mus go, I don‚Äôt know who would lead a coup to clean out the rats nest. clearly the soldiers are kept under the watchful eye of the SBU.  The enormous ammount of western money flowing in must have corrupted a huge part of their officer corp.  so the poor ukranian grunt keep getting marched into the machine guns with a bayonnet at their backs.

            Zelinsky is not exactly a salt-of-earth Ukrainan peasant. His agenda is not their welfare. The whole point of a nation conceding defeat is to avoid the whole nation being destroyed over some territorial dispute. But, if it‚Äôs not your nation, why cut your loses? Why not just burn it all to a crisp? Zelinskys agenda is not about Ukraine and especially not about the Ukrainan people.

        One of the reasons America always has a war to fight, is that a military degrades in peacetime. Not only does the individual soldier not get any combat experience, and new weapon systems aren‚Äôt being field tested, but the institution as a whole atrophies. We see this in Israel, where thirty years of fighting teenagers with slingshots have rendered the IDF unable to even defeat Hezbollah.Apart from the short peacekeeping mission in Georgia, the Russian military haven‚Äôt really had much action since Chechnya, but now they get to train against an adversary armed with modern weapons, coms and operational doctrines while the US is stuck doing special ops and fighting camel jockeys. If you were a cynic, you might suspect this to be a weighty reason for Putin to not just pull out all the stops and roll up to the Polish border.I, for one, look forward to speaking Russian. I never really rated Dostoyevsky, but the connoisseurs say he‚Äôs much better in the original language.

            America didn‚Äôt fight a war to speak of from 1972 to 1990, and yet the military did not grow soft.  It learned from ‚ÄòNam, and the debacles at Desert 1 and Granada, and was at its peak by Gulf War 1.  Then, came Somalia, and Bosnia and continuing low level war in the Gulf until 911.  During those nest ten years, Diversity came a-calling wearing a Monica Lewinski beret, and there was slow slide to Tranny shows and getting humiliated in Afghanistan and bumper-boat navy despite constant combat operations in every fly-blown shit hole on the planet.Peace doesn‚Äôt ruin a military:  Protracted warfare does.

                Fair point.But Somalia was a special ops affair and Bosnia (I assume you mean Kosovo) was just the USAF carpet bombing civilians, like the Israelis do in Gaza at the moment. The Serbs managed to extract their ground forces from Kosovo virtually unscathed, because nobody wanted to risk going low and dirty to root them out on the ground level.GW1 was a real war, done right: overwhelming superiority from the start. But whatever lesson was taken from GW1 was abolished when, in GW2, Paul Wolfowitz decided to scrap the true and tested Manual of Major Ass-Kicking with his mighty brain and go full Rommel, fight the war with only mobile columns and tactical air.So I figure that we‚Äôve yet to see if the American military retains serious fighting power. The US grunts still have the best training money can buy ‚Äì trannies and all ‚Äì and the world‚Äôs best logistics, of course, but the institutional level hasn‚Äôt been tested since ‚Äô72. There are some really sketchy dudes on the general staff and that‚Äôs without mentioning the drag queens, morale or public support.I used to have very long debates with Danish soldiers during Afghanistan: our military is designed to fight the Soviet Union, so how is fighting goat herders armed with pop guns and cherry bombs any measure of our fighting power?We had a contingent of Leopard 2 tanks in Helmand and I questioned the value of bringing such overkill to a mission that basically was about handing out candy to children, building wells and helping old women cross the street. ‚ÄúBut‚Äù, one tank officer explained ‚Äúa plaster round is a great way to bust open the gate into a compound.I had no idea what a plaster round was ‚Äì turned out it is training ammunition. Yikes! Here I am, paying my taxes to send a main battle tank halfway across the globe, only to see them firing marshmallows at the ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù The purpose of an MBT is to level the compound from five miles away, rock up and grind the rubble into gravel under the belts.Same thing with the F-16s: they‚Äôre so expensive to fly that Danish troops essentially needed some flunky in NATO headquarters to greenlight every mission, because the targets in Helmand were of such low value that it was rarely worth the cost.This was an issue when a squad of hussars ran into an ambush with no air support granted and which, famously, was caught by an embedded movie producer. Seeing the Danish conscripts clear out a machinegun nest with rifles and grenades was big nice since nobody was killed, but it‚Äôs not how such an engagement is supposed to be resolved when you‚Äôre carrying water for the United Fucking States of America.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7sZ7IfkDRQ

        Probably the most significant story I saw in recent days was Ramaswamy turning from a legitimate and rational beginning of the US becoming independent from Israel. He did an about face and then got on his knees and said the entire people and nation were Divine. It was disturbing. At the same time, the circles he travels in must be choking on red pills. I am sure his ire is raised to unbefore seen heights at being forced to grovel like that.My thoughts have been turning like a composting mulch bin in recent days. What will post-AINO be in 40 years?When I look at it objectively, I can only conclude that it is already a vassal state. I was thinking that a possible and even likely path for it is that it will be a bunch of internal tribes/clans fighting over who will get to be the satrap and run its spoils system. Externally, rivals will fight over who gets to make it its vassal.I don‚Äôt know. I think we all need to focus on bunkering up and be squared away in our immediate family and friend group. Ideally you are all in a location that is buffered from the worst excesses of anarcho-tyranny. Next, we become a concious folk and undertake the endeavors that will bind us together and ensure a future to eternity.

            The Indians will navigate the various power bases. They know that Jews have tremendous political power via donors, control the party organizations and the media.So, if they have to kowtow the Zionists, they‚Äôll do it.But what‚Äôs different about the Indians is that they‚Äôre extremely aware that this is a transactional affair. Jews have more power than they do, so Jews get to tell them what to do. Fine, but it‚Äôs just business to them. They have no belief that the Jews should run things.The Indians will try to build their own bases of power, money, politicians and media because they see that it‚Äôs worked for the Jews.Trust me, I live in Northern Virginia, which has a lot of Indians. They are already making their way into local and low-level state politics. It‚Äôs all business to them.Ramaswamy going soft is just a tactic. He‚Äôs operating from a very different playbook than DeSantis and the others. Jews are just another tribe to be dealt with to him.

                The hardest thing for modern whites to understand is ethnic solidarity. It is utterly an alien concept to most of us. We may have had this prior to WW2, but it‚Äôs been lost because of reasons we all know well.We‚Äôre entering a phase where the sons of immigrants are taking charge. They all grew up in 80% white America, and have a chip on their shoulder; they probably have a racism story or two, either of themselves or their parents. But they don‚Äôt hate white people as I‚Äôm sure most of them had very positive experiences, and on some level they understand that they fled their brown home for a white one.The difference is they were brought up with certain ethnic inculcations (as were the likes of Andrew Yang and Michelle Wu) and their race was likely a driving force‚Ä¶not necessarily to replace whites, but to compete along with them. ‚ÄúCompete‚Äù being the operative word, as whites don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre competing with anyone racially, just meritocratically. So Indians and Chinese compete with Jews and whites and everyone else, while whites compete with performance metrics.What will happen when the grandsons of immigrants take charge, and the country is 50% white? Will they still have the memory of their ancestors rescuing them from their brown home, and being surrounded by nice color-blind whites? Or will they see us as just another ethny to compete with‚Ä¶like a prison yard?

                They are all about this dispensationalist nonsense.   I confront them when the opportunity happens.    I don‚Äôt make many friends but that is the price of truth.   I urge everyone to tell them these points.
#1.  The modern nation state of Israel is not the Israel of the Bible.   It holds no biblical significance today.#2.   ALL of the biblical prophecies relating to Israel have already been fulfilled.  Every single one of them.#3.  There is a chosen people today.   Hint:  It is not those people who hate Christ.

                    I am gratified to see the Scofield Bible and its history start to make its way into mainstream discourse.  Just a coincidence that a big push was made for dispensationalism exactly at the time the Zionist movement found its wings.

                I think the Israel lobby is slowly losing its grip. The ADL, perhaps the most loathsome part of it, has taken some real hits lately. The Israel lobby was a 20th century thing, slowly fading.

                    The Israeli lobby seems to be strong and intact, but the street demonstrations are greater than ever.  This means a loss at the level of the populace.  Of course, easily explained by our changing demographics.  This loss will eventually make its way up the power chain and into Congress.  Especially when one considers that the most supportive demographic‚ÄîWhite Boomers‚Äîare dying off.  In 20 years, I predict an end to the strangle hold of Israel on our political decisions.  Israeli politics needs to adjust to this potential reality and quickly.

                        That‚Äôs my take as well, Compsci. I think the ferocity of the anti-Israel protests knocked them back on their heels. It was especially unanticipated in the United States. Given how the Tribe went all-in on ethnic replacement, it‚Äôs almost an overdose of karma. I doubt the adjustment can be made in twenty years, either, because it is becoming doubtful the GAE holds on that long.

                        Well, the Israeli rush to finish with the ethnic cleansing may be a recognition that the sugar daddy of old (or uncle sucker, if you prefer) is on his way down. Similarly with the effort to try to get ZUSA to take out Iran now before any semblance of a puissant ZUSA military is gone.
I think that they are wrong on both counts; the time has passed, and largely this is traceable to Zionist own goals, first with Russia, and lately with China.

                        Yes. The frogs are getting wise to the scorpions. The one thing the Neocons/Zionists did not learn is that for Israel to survive America needed to survive.
As they were destroying America they never noticed they were destroying their life support.    It is now obvious that the rest of the world will not come to their aid.

            Weirdest thing I‚Äôve read about Johnson ‚Äî well, maybe not the weirdest, but it‚Äôs up there ‚Äî is how he adopted a 14-year-old black boy when he was 25 and engaged to be married.
Seriously, who does this? Is this common in Louisiana? I mean, to any sensible person, we know exactly what‚Äôs going on. But we have to pretend it‚Äôs not what it is.

                I‚Äôll field this.  When American whites are young and full of brainwashed telescopic altruism they‚Äôll go down to the local, urban Child and Family Services office (which is only ever full of one kind of kid) and have their heartstrings pulled by the stories that are told there.  It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶‚Äùmissionary work as take-out‚Äù.But why a 14-year old?‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a lot of upside there as they can take care of themselves and will age out within a few years anyway in case it doesn‚Äôt work out, which it won‚Äôt.(And no, this nothing I have super-personal experience with, though I know more about it than I care to).

            I‚Äôm really getting sick of these evangelicals wanting Israel Jewish so they can build the Third Temple so evangelicals can get the rapture they all crave. I was hearing this crap back in the 1980s. They got some traction in the 1990s but thankfully neoconservatism and neoliberalism killed off the old Christian coalition. But now they‚Äôre back partying like it‚Äôs 1994.

        &gt; The cost of the war in terms of men and material is manageable so they can continue it as long as needed
We essentially gave free training to Russian troops on modern warfare tactics, especially drones. We also gave them a leg up on ramping up war production and logistics in a nice streamlined manner. The sanctions seemed to only succeed in getting Russia to recognize some economic choke points and neutralize them. It is all pretty much an expensive but incredibly useful trial run for a real geopolitical conflict.

Trudeau, Disco Girl in Finland, Horse Face from NZ, and all the other Young Global Dolts are controlled, because they are absolutely mediocre. They are incapable of original thought and are delighted to be taken in hand and have their tiny minds molded.
Does that honestly sound like Vlad?
He tried to court and charm the West years ago. Attending and mingling with the WEF was a part of that. He learned a lot, no doubt. And now he is using that knowledge‚Ä¶.

                        My impression is that Putin does what is in his best interests.  At the moment, his interests and those of the Russian people align.  Perhaps he is truly converted, I don‚Äôt know.  But Putin being in the WEF or any other organization doesn‚Äôt really seem to mean much with him.  He is far smarter and much more independent than your typical WEF ‚ÄúYoung Leader‚Äù whore.

        This war could drag out for years at the pace it‚Äôs going. I understand the Russian aversion to casualties, and I believe they are also trying to keep other countries neutral by not going crazy with bombing civilians. Because while they have a decent industrial base, Russia is undoubtedly dependent on China for material.
With that being said though, there is something to the term letting a bad team hang around. The longer it drags out the greater the chances of the unexpected occurring. A 10 year war isn‚Äôt in the interest of russia anymore than it is for Ukraine.

            A lot of people have criticized Russia for being so tentative, especially with regards to civilian casualties, but Gaza is proving them right. Israel is immune from the normal moral considerations and yet they are getting enormous pushback over civilian deaths in Gaza. It shows the Russians were right to be so concerned for the optics.

                It remains to be seen how much that pushback actually matters. I think if they manage to send a few hundred thousand Gazans to Europe and the West, then it‚Äôs ‚Äúmissions accomplished‚Äù for them.

                    That is my thinking. The plan has always been to drive off the Palestinians. A little here, a little there and over time the job is finished. This time they force out a few hundred thousand in one push, but make sure conditions are even more miserable than before so the place keeps emptying out. You can be sure there is tucked away in the Israeli aid bill provisions to relocate these people to your neighborhood.

The US has more Jews than Israel (I‚Äôd better fact-check that!) so if they‚Äôre so rattled by a few hundred National Justice Party members, why willingly import a couple hundred thousand potential anti-Semites?

                        Yes. You can also be sure that they have also concocted the means to get the pro-Palestinian fact back on side. There will be a massive campaign to focus on being kind and compassionate and opening the gates to them. They will turn the attention from Israel as the bad guy to the ‚Äúanti-immigrant‚Äù white people as the gad guy. It will done with the greatest of ease too.The good whites will be the first with the hook in their mouth as they must not be seen as ‚Äúanti-semites.‚Äù The churches will get billions to do the heavy lifting. In 20 years those churches will be empty and bulldozed over to make room for mosques. Even better. The moves on their board are all lined up in plain sight.Sad how easily we get played over and over again.

Those ‚Äúanti-semites‚Äù will be very useful for attacking the Main Enemy. Never lose sight of the fact that wailing about ‚Äúanti-semitism‚Äù is merely a technique to destroy the cohesion and pride which used to characterize the Main Enemy.

                        Marko:  ‚Äú. . .  why willingly import a couple hundred thousand potential anti-Semites?‚ÄùThe Jews aren‚Äôt about to abandon their century-old project to destroy the US and make White people a despised and vanishing minority ‚Äì particularly since the trajectory for that is already baked into the birth and death rates.  They are not a people known for moderation.  They hate us more than they love their own (and that‚Äôs saying something).Plus they remain convinced (yes, even still) that they can control the dusky hordes they‚Äôve imported.  They believe controlling the purse strings is sufficient  ‚Äì and given how many putative Whites have sold out for sufficient shekels, who‚Äôs to say they‚Äôre wrong?  Pull enough university endowments, slash a few donations to BLM, and they‚Äôre certain everyone will fall back into line.What I don‚Äôt think they considered, however, is just how much they are disliked by just about everyone else.  The Europeans are not their biggest fans (for good reasons) and weren‚Äôt even before the arrival of the Mediterranean millions.  And other than the outsize influence of the Christian Zionists, most White people don‚Äôt venerate them and value the lives of their own children.  Given all the domestic problems and people‚Äôs monetary difficulties, it takes a lot of media manipulating to get everyone jazzed up for war.  For various reasons, it‚Äôs not working the way it did during the ‚ÄúGlobal War on Terror.‚ÄùI think (I hope) they‚Äôve miscalculated.  Either way the long term outlook is bleak for White people, but I hope the Jews see their plans backfire.  Not merely for the schadenfreude, but because if Whites are ever again to have a hope of controlling their own territory and destiny, this symbiotic relationship needs to die.

                        I admit I know only the barest details of the history, but it‚Äôs my understanding that the Palestinians are basically the Negro of the Arab world. Nobody wants them. Islamic nations are not known for taking in refugees at all, even allegedly fellow Muslims.For conjecture, let‚Äôs assume that Israel is successful in getting all the Palestinians to leave for elsewhere. That would surely help the Israelis short-term. But if USA, EU, etc. accept large numbers of them, they probably won‚Äôt be a good mix, but probably no worse than the run of the mill migrant from a shithole country. But they‚Äôll probably bear a special animus against the Small Hats already here. I wonder if the Zionists have thought through all the ramifications. I‚Äôd bet not.

                        It‚Äôs been miserable in Gaza for a long time without any reduction in the number of Gazans.

            Russia is thinking of more than just optics in avoiding bombing civilians. They are dealing with fellow Slavs. They see them as brothers and cousins.
Israelis seem to view the Palestinians the way the Ukie nationalists see Russians: as Orcs. Vile and evil creatures to be eliminated from the earth.
So everything is normal and dandy in the GAE.

                Russia also seems to see the value in maintaining infrastructure in tact over territory it may soon own.
I suppose in Gaza, there is not much infrastructure worth saving.

            And we have a winner here .  you are absolutely correct Hun .  the american state department coup on the ukrainian government in 2014 was to kick this off. it has has all been a well orchastrated progrom to kill off the ukrainian men , and drive the ukrainians from their farmland. It‚Äôs some of the best in the world.the added ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù is that it has freed up ukrainian women and children  to be trafficked to brothels all from pakistan to Egypt.The women and children  not trafficked will be spending their time in the refugee centers in europe. You know , the ones full of military age men from the middle east and africa. The primary goal was to get all the land and resources for ADM abd Blackrock. the ‚Äúrebuilding ‚Äù contracts are already in place.

        ‚ÄúAs for Russia, the war is just one part of a larger geopolitical strategy that looks far past the Ukraine situation.‚Äù
Absolutely. They see Ukraine as just one front in a developing world war. And they play the long game, with patience and with fortitude. They are not like the ADHD West that flits from one thing to another and perhaps cannot even think strategically any more (unless you count the hare-brained plans of the crazed neocons as such).

                Serendipity is underrated. Israel has been looking for an excuse to liquidate part of Gaza and Netanyahu was looking for a way to end the internal fights in Israel. The Saudis were looking for an excuse to end the pending deal with Israel. Washington wanted a distraction from Ukraine. Iran is probably not broken hearted over this, as it brings China and Russia closer.
Lots of people have reasons to welcome this Hamas attack.

                    Serendipitous indeed. Europe and America always had different views of Israel, and the ethnic cleansing in Gaza has widened that rift. Yes, Scholz, Sunic, Macron, and Co. are averting their eyes, but lots if not most of their constituents are not (this is happening for the first time on a large scale in the United States, too, although American policymakers are autocrats unconcerned with public opinion). Given Netanyahu is committing atrocities that far exceed the purported crimes alleged in anti-Putin propaganda, the United States‚Äô grand plans to maintain Europe as its last satrapy via war with Russia may prove a self-own.The war goal as such was said to be to weaken Russia. I am uncertain one way or another how much has been achieved there. It has without doubt weakened the United States and Europe, and a divisive Middle Eastern genocide almost certainly will drive a wedge between them. Nothing better illustrates the utter incompetence of the modern-day GAE and its WEF puppetmasters.

        Looks like Mearsheimer was spot on in 2015. ‚ÄúThe West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path, and the end result is that Ukraine is going to get wrecked.‚Äù

                        Interesting thought miforest.  Does Israel  consider any country its ‚Äúfriend‚Äù.  Does it have any friends?  Is there any sister country in the world for a Jewish State?  I can see for example, a strong friendship between say the UK and the USA.  But for Israel?  Who?

                And Col. MacGregor as Secretary of Defense, and given the range of his historical and geopolitical knowledge, perhaps also National Security Advisor.
I had the opportunity to sit and talk with him one on one for an all too brief time once maybe a year and a half ago, and the Man Knew Stuff, an informed observer of history, the rise and fall of nations, and the causes thereof.

                        An old friend of mine was also a friend of his, and the opportunity arose when he was visiting with her for me to join them. I took it up with avidity, but since he is such a busy man, the time was short to enjoy his company and his distilled life experience.

                    His 3 part conversation with Michael Vlahos is well worth watching. His deep knowledge manifests in ways not permitted in the short-form briefings he gives on the Judge and elsewhere. He is one of the best our system has produced, so of course the trash-clowns-that-rule close ranks against him.
