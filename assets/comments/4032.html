        The main operating principle of our politics has become “destroying the village to save it”. No constraint is too sacrosanct it can’t be bulldozed in the name of “giving the people what we think they need”. Or in the words of Mencken, the citizenry is going to get it good and hard.

        How about for starters we kick the UN out of our country and stop giving tax dollars to them? F the UN. We don’t need them. We are supposed to kowtow to a bunch of third world despots, half of which are Moslems? In the end, with a president who is NOT the current Emperor, and hopefully there will not be a Emperor II, we can just tell the UN to sit and spin. What are they going to do?

        In fact is the poor who live in hills in Brazil, they’re called “morros”, the elites live in the center of the cities but they also have beach houses, one thing that is common among Latin-American elites is that they all have mansions in Miami.

        Interesting points you make, and to some degree echoed here by my own nation’s slavish desire to follow European dictatorship. Parliament is basically redundant and devolves into a talking shop for trivia: whatever is decided in Westminster is small beer because the trump cards dealt by some fat Belgian while being pleasured by Germans in Strasbourg will always win. Gordon Brown (the economic disaster as Prime Minister who can’t be bothered now even attending the House of Commons as his town’s MP because he is too busy rushing off to give speeches in far-flung places about how good he was at economics) said Britain would become like North Korea if it left the EU. Amazing stuff.Anyhow, I was alerted by your theme and your sentence : “Citizenship, therefore, has value.”The way things are, the elite have already shown they do not value citizenship in the west because it is freely given (or the financial benefits of it) to people who have no right to be called citizens. They certainly don’t have any great enthusiasm for their new home nation. This in time will impact on the armed forces and consequently a country’s ability to defend itself. In the UK we have the tribes arriving and being more excited about fighting in some Middle Eastern ruined town that defending their new, ‘welcome-and-here’s-free-cash’ world.They like guns and RPGs but are not so keen on wearing an army uniform.My point is that citizenship is being routinely downgraded. Who needs citizens when no one at the top cares? Eventually there will be no citizens with loyalties left. Here the BBC describes teenage females who fly out to be screwed in the desert by murderous barbarians, as ‘British’  They aren’t by any stretch of the imagination, but they have a passport with a meaningless coat of arms on the front. In time there will just be people who may pay taxes and who may vote as directed, but they will only be tolerated because they perform some minor economic function. The police, who will be prevented from checking crime, will be there to enforce Facebook terms and conditions and guard against the heinous sin of saying boo to a goose.So… Boo!
