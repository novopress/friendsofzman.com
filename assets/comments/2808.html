        As an unfortunate red stater living in the Peoples Republic of Maryland, all I can say is the nation better pray that OweMalley gets nowhere with his presidential ambitions.  The taking class of this state all live in the city and around DC.  I all for ceding those counties and the city of Baltimore back to DC so they can all tax themselves to death and leave the rest of the state to its red ways.

        Ah yes those EBT cards. I’ll renounce myself right now as a reactionary and nativist, but I get irritated watching Somalis pushing brimming shopping carts full of goodies in my local Krogers while I’m chasing bargains I can afford.It seems everywhere you go in America, there’s a Somali contingent. I wonder if anybody but the jolly Pirates of the Red Sea still live there.

            There are roughly 10 million Somalis. It seems that all of them are looking to settle in the west. Sweden is taking in tens of thousands every year. I think they are up to 40K in the last two years. I just imagine the guy who did ten years in prison coming back to his home town of Lewiston Maine, only to find Bantu warriors on every street corner.

        “The reason they can’t get credit is they are not here legally and they have no money.”Bit you see, IMMEDIATELY after asylum/amnestyis bestowed,…you know, AFTER the election,  “suddenly” there will be an avalanche of EBT cards ripe for the harvesting.
