        I once worked blue-collar, smoked with the boys on break and went back at it. Blue-collar sucked a lot and I went into a job where I was sitting down a lot more. Also quit smoking.Blue-collar jobs down my way have mostly dried up. My buddy does that kind of work still and has me come and help him once a week. Went out on break and there was nothing to do. Looked around at the trailers being unloaded and a magnetic scrap loader. Boring! Had a cigarette. Haven’t taken it up again permanently since I am only there a day a week.Is the decline in smoking connected to the decline in blue-collar work?Strange that MCLs hate smoking but throw a party for every homosexual out-coming. Homosexual men have greater numbers of every disease like syphilis, gonorrhoea, HIV, giadiarsis, worms, warts, proctitis, herpes, etc and the public has to pay for it.And homos have a much shorter average life span than smokers.Their domestic violence rates are double that of normos.Oh the delicious hypocrisy! Look away children, look away!

        I did my best programming when I could smoke a cigarette while thinking about the coding. Years later, after being forced to quit, it seemed harder to get it done. Of course, it could be simply that I was older, and thus slower in brain function. No way to test that theory, and it’s way too late, now.

        Tocqueville thought so poorly of the adherents of atheism  that he believed even Islam to be a less harmful alternative then atheism or polytheism. When studying the Koran and related documents before visiting Algeria, he changed his mind. The actual visit increased his horror.The politics of Islam and Marxism are not terribly different. When Muslims lose faith they easily gravitate to Marxism, and sometimes before. Neither has any ground for the peculiar needs of liberty to root. Although is is obvious that the Marxist hate Christians more than they fear Islamist, that is because it is really liberty that they detest.

        I take serious issue with your characterization of Islam. There is almost nothing about Islam that is wise or beautiful. Islam is a totalitarian political system using the shield of religion to advance it’s cause. And what is its cause? World domination, the entire world under Sharia Law. There is absolutely nothing about Islam that is sensible, not even for a tribal culture. You got the brutality part right, because every Moslem is required to follow the literal example of the “prophet” of Islam, Mohammed. And what is this example? Mohammed was a thief, a pedophile, a polygamist, and a mass murderer. He commanded his followers to kill the infidel (anyone who is not Moslem) wherever he is, to kill the homosexual, to subjugate women, and force people to either convert to Islam, pay a tax called the jizya (wherein the payer of the tax submits to Sharia), or be killed. Anyone coming to their senses and leaving Islam is called an apostate and is killed.I’ve really only scratched the surface here of this most horrible of religions called Islam. The 1400 year history of Islam is available for anyone to read. It is a history of brutality, subjugation, and death. More people have died at the “alter” of Islam than any other religion. Even Marxism did not kill as many.I would recommend this: if you really don’t know that much about Islam, which I find to be pretty common, you owe it to yourself to come up to speed. If you’re not up for reading the Koran at this time, I highly recommend the website inquiryintoislam.com to get you or anyone else started.
