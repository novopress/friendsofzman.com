        The current global capitalist system of floating exchange rates was established in Bretton Woods in July 1944, when the outcome of WW2 was more or less a certainty. But even during the credit expansion brought on by the Marshall Plan, the dollar remained backed by gold.  The era of fiat currencies really began in 1971, when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard when it became clear that the US would run deficits in perpetuity because it couldn’t pay for both Vietnam and Johnson’s Great Society out of existing revenues.  It was either that, or tax the middle class out of existence, and at the time neither party was keen on that idea.Fast forward half a century, and a limitless fiat currency has enabled the unending growth of the state and an unchecked capitalism and credit expansion that has bolstered a feckless elite that has less and less use for the nation they ostensibly rule, while a shrinking and endangered middle class has begun to assert itself against a system they rightly perceive as rigged against them.  The difference between then and now is that the old guard that called itself “conservative” – the Nixons and the Buckleys and the Goldwaters and even the Moynihans – wanted to keep a social arrangement that protected middle class mores and livelihoods because it was understood that a prosperous middle class was the best guarantee of social stability and classically liberal government.  It was axiomatic that those things went hand in hand. Our current elites, the products of our better schools, have no such understanding and would be flabbergasted if anyone attempted to explain it to them.  To them, the white middle class are not the bulwarks of stability but an differentiated mass of bigots and racists destined for the ash heap of history as impediments to the dawning utopia of multicultural diversity.Someone is going to end up on the ash heap of history all right, but we’ll see who gets there first.

Wade either.

        If you squint, you can picture Bernie walking in the white house wearing a vest and underpants.Back in the day, there were plenty of communist countries which Americans could look to in order to know just how badly communism fails in each and every country. No one sane wanted communism. Now that they failed their way out of that system, idiots with short memories in the West (and youngsters who weren’t alive back in the day) think communism isn’t only “social justice” (groan), but economically viable.Sometimes I think even you, ZMan, thinks you can just stick it to the rich and the big corporations and the result would be a better economy.Also, given that the last economic crash was due to left-wing ‘social justice’ programs of leaning on banks to give mortgages to poor people unlikely to ever be able to pay it back, which was viewed as a way to get blacks to join the middle class, the criticism of capitalism (if that’s what you criticise) seems unfair. These bad loans weren’t small. They weren’t lending out $349.95, these were mortgages and when you give a lot of these massive loans to large numbers of people who won’t pay it back, you get trouble.

        The two big last gasp events were when Taft- Mr Conservative was shafted by the warmongering interventionists who’d made out in WWII and the rise of Buckley. a CIA tool whose purpose was the promotion of the idiot idea of “big government conservatism”.
The political system, as currently constituted,  has political parties who are merely the two wings of the same bird of prey.

        Don’t forget that the decline of the west has come about because people had too much time on their hands.In Europe the emphasis for twenty years was clearing up the rubble and the next ten was making sure that what replaced it was not rubble. But then… job done or perhaps, job thought to be done. Either way, people suddenly had time to think not about rebuilding but about personal views such as fairness and caring, which involved a lot of staring into mirrors and deciding we could be fairer and nicer. This, in turn became a rallying cry for ‘hey, let’s be even more caring and nicer’ and the more recent ‘I care about being more nice and even more fair more than you do.’This process may have started slightly earlier in the States because Europe’s upheavals were, thankfully, out of a bomber’s range (though apparently the Germans were trying to build a bomber that would make a one-way trip to New York, which would have been interesting to say the least).While this polishing and use of mirrors was going on the rest of the world snickered at there west and said they would take over, because they didn’t give a damn about if they were fair or nice. Right now the west has not quite turned away from preening itself in the mirror, so they aren’t looking round as they might.So I do not fear the Yesterday Men: I fear the Tomorrow Men (if they dare call themselves men) who has no recollection of any part of yesterday and think only tomorrow counts without even knowing you have to get through today first.

            I fully agree with your notion that “too much time on their hands”  is the main cause of the idiocy on display today.  When all and I do mean all people worked their collective or solitary asses off just to put food on the table there was no time for “ghey marriage”,  trans-gender fantasy, micro aggressions, rayciss nonsense,  “feminism”  and “studies of any variety that did not yield positive concrete results.  As the theme from All In The Family stated,  “Didn’t need no welfare state, everybody pulled their weight…”  With half of our population on the dole, “preening in front of Z”s metaphorical mirror, only hard times will cure the malaise.

        All things considered, I would much prefer the political state of affairs in the Post-Bellum phase of the 19th century. In cultural and political terms, it was a far more refined time.

        Great post, as usual. But …. (whine, wheeze) I was really hoping at the end that you’d be suggesting some possible new economic arrangements. Because not only are the globalists squeezing us to death, the banksters for a hundred years now have been continuously looting us, and soon we’ll have cheap-smart robots replacing our semi-skilled workers.So yes, we need new political rules, but we also *desperately* need major economic changes before we turn into Argentina-North. And we all know Smoot-Hawley II ain’t the answer.Perhaps some kind of a Social Credit system (to replace ALL existing entitlement programs), combined with an outlawing of fractional reserve banking and concurrently killing off the Fed, combined with some minor flavor of Japanese import rules and regs (NOT tariffs), might do the trick.Also we’d also have to pass a few laws regarding large business, perhaps: – 1) employee compensation for all corporations above a certain size must consist of at least 30% voting stock; 2) likewise all corporations above a certain size must pay substantially into a small business incubator/training system, and 3) all foreign-owned businesses operating in this country must similarly pay into to a technical worker training fund. Both of the above systems to be run privately and competitively.Maybe those aren’t the best ideas possible, but the intent is to a) kill the tyrannical government Leviathan which is bankrupting us; b) finally make banking an honest competitive business, made up of local banks who know their clientele personally, instead of a multinational license to steal; c) kill off war-for-profit as a result of the banking reforms and a stable dollar; and last but not least – d)grow and strengthen local citizens/workers, local ownership, and local companies .And I’d be most grateful for anybody who shared a better idea or two with me.

        Welcome to Weimar America.  From the mid-1920s, German voters gave a plurality of their votes to two parties, the Communists and the Nazis, who clearly, loudly, and repeatedly promised to end representative government if they got voted in.  Neither Trump nor Sanders knows his head from his ass, and doesn’t know the Constitution from the owner’s manual of a 1993 Geo Prizm, but absent some very shady shenanigans at their respective conventions, one of them is going to be President of the United States.

            I think you do Trump a YUUGE  injustice. He’s a master of a level of communication and persuasion that you clearly don’t comprehend, because you’re put off by his bombast, instead of embracing it as a tactic.. All you’re showing is that you’re thinking “checkers”, while the Donald is playing 3D chess.  He’s a very smart guy, both intellectually and street smarts-wise. In a candid moment he’d tell you he doesn’t sh*t about a lot of things, but that’s what his money is for, to buy the best guys who do know sh*t about something. That’s how you make real money is his business: understanding what you don’t know, then going out and buying that knowledge from the best.  In contrast, Jeb! is not a dumb guy either, but the Donald has now reduced him to yelling, “See my mommy and my bro think I’m great.” Hardly words to win with.

        Sorry, I don’t want to comment on grammar, but maybe the title is fair game?
Do you mean “Yesterday’s Men”, which I’m guessing is what you meant, or “Yesterday Man”?

                I agree.  Yesterday Men says it perfectly.   The Beatles did not sing about “Nowhere’s Man”…
The essay is brilliant.  And its headline fits.  In this context, each of the leading candidates is a Yesterday Man.
