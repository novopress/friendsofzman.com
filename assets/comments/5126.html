        An agenda? I suppose.  The core structure of the American Constitution was its separation of powers, now destroyed by modern liberals.  As a matter of history, that constitutional doctrine has its origins in the English Civil war and, strangely, does not descend to us from the followers of Charles but from the Puritans. See MJC Vile’s book “Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers” for the details. It is available through the Liberty Fund.

        Speaking of the American Civil War, more than one historian has noted that the one general who seems to have been beamed directly from Cromwell’s army into that conflict was: Stonewall Jackson.

            I like curry, but that does not make me a Hindu. Stonewall Jackson was out of the Appalachian culture of early America, not the Puritan tradition. Not even close.
I sense an agenda here.

        Your premise about the migration from England, particularly prior to the revolutionary war, affecting current attitudes is basically correct. However it is far more complicated than you describe.Albion’s Seed: Four British Folkways in America by David Hackett Fischer describes this complex source of our various cultures from the outset. But even he does not fully expand it to the current era. Black Rednecks and White Liberals by Thomas Sowell does, to a fair extent, bring it to the current era for a few select groups..Of note, the era of massive European migration from southern and eastern Europe came to a halt in the 1920’s with the introduction of limitations on immigration. This allowed those immigrants over the next several decades to assimilate. The culture at that time, in effect, forced Americanization. The 1960’s immigration law that Edward Kennedy had enacted allowing new massive immigration from a variety of nations, subsidizing them and encouraging “diversity” and not assimilation. This is the situation facing America today. It is Balkanizing our country.I personally would not use roundheads and cavaliers of the English Civil Was and apply them to current American political trends in as much as under the Roundheads you had a ruler called the “Lord Protector” and under the Cavaliers the ruler was called “King”. The Restoration returned King Charles II to power after Cromwell died because of the incompetence of his son who assumed the position of Lord Protector. Neither was particularly for individuals though the result was a stronger parliament which over time reduced the power of the “King”. Unfortunately at this time the British Parliament, much like the federal government in america, is accumulating more and more power and diminishing the individual.

            Honestly, I had trouble keeping that post under my self-imposed limit of 1500 words. It is a huge topic upon which I could go on for a long time. Albion’s Seed is a big book for a reason.Maybe I’ll do a long post on my thoughts at some point, but I’m suing the English Civil War as a starting point. The Puritans evolved into our modern liberals, which means they dropped a lot of traits and developed other ones, but some core values are still there.Similarly, the Tidewater culture has faded entirely. Faulkner wrote about the rise of the vermin-like Snopes clan, who reflect the Scots-Irish Appalachian culture. They slowly overwhelmed the Royalist culture of the South, which was largely destroyed by the Puritans in the American Civil War.

        The phrase “separation of powers,” as well as the political doctrine, originates among Puritan political theorists during the English Civil War. It doesn’t exist before that. The political theory that it displaced was called mixed government, which was the belief that the “King in Parliament” was a unitary system of government.  The separation of powers was then taken up as the definition of constitutional government by Montesquieu who was the primary influence on the Founders. But the separation of powers doctrine, as the core structure of the American Constitution, originates with the English Puritans.

        I had long thought the history of the U.S. is Massachusetts vs. Virginia. Roundhead vs. Cavalier spells it out. Thanks, Z Man.

        UGH – I read the article at Salon link in its entirety.  One may safely assume that any work of prose that requires the use of so many lefty power words like “the Other”, “Islamophobia”, and “toxic masculinity” is horseshit on stilts.  Those whole thing is really more of anomnium gatherumof left-wing slogans and jargon than it is an essay to designed to persuade the reader or advocate a political position in any meaningful way.

        How about the connection of Wall Street bankers like Jacob Schiff to Communist revolutionaries like Leon Trotsky?
Fascism was a European response to the rise of International Marxism promoted by non-Europeans, France first Socialist Prime Minister was the jew Leon Blum.

        The Roundheads vs. Cavaliers thing as the source of our present troubles is a vast oversimplification and distortion. The idea of separated powers within government, the structure of the American Constitution, originates in the dispute between the Puritan Parliament and the king, and in the Puritan understanding of the covenant (as found in the Old and New Testaments) as the basis of law rather than a unitary state under a monarch. In terms of their core political theory, Jefferson, Madison, and the other southerners are, in essence, Roundheads.
