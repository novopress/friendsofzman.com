        Oh dear
At the 1:42 mark of the Carlson/Putin interview, Vlad said the thing I never thought I would hear;
‚ÄúDiversity is our strength‚Ä¶‚Äù

        Ah, yes, but all feedback loops require a regulator of some kind. What is the regulator in the modern world?I would argue that TELEVISION is the regulator for what feedback exists currently. And it is places like MSNBC and CNN ‚Äî the leftist primary organs ‚Äî that tell you what is currently acceptable, since we live under a leftist dominion.This is why a smart man holds his nose and watches at least a little MSNBC. They set the Overton window. Acceptable and unacceptable discourse is determined there. Fox News may like to bluster and stagger around proclaiming its independence, but the limits to what it can say on race, IQ, and the rest are determined solely by MSNBC.[To read more of my stuff, click on my name up above with your mouse]

            Z: Please ban this retarded spammer and his tiresome self-promotion. ‚Äúclick on my name‚Äù, he bleats, as if we are in need of his  instruction in the ways of the web. Always and ever, his wisdom is the shining beacon in the darkness. That he has lasted this long is a testament to the fact that people behave online in ways they never would in the physical world, lest they risk a beating and ejection from the environment they despoil.

        This broken feedback loop üîÅ  of America is correct.The description of the French Revolution isn‚Äôt, they knew and couldn‚Äôt fix the problems, because there were too many legacies- literally.   The French nobility‚Äôs extra sons went in the Army ‚Äì and an excellent army it was ‚Äì but how to pay?But the Dickens version of history isn‚Äôt correct, I doubt if Dickens would claim so.The Origins of Contemporary France by Hippolyte Taine far more useful.     Or the Ancien Regime and the Revolution by de Tocqueville ‚Äì less so and he didn‚Äôt finish it.   France was ruled by an Intendancy ‚Äì 30 Top bureaucrats .  Think 30 Faucis and you have the idea , or 30 Greenspans.    But they knew and couldn‚Äôt fix it.In that way we‚Äôre France.  The Cloud People you refer to ‚Ä¶ are a obscene TV show.  The Intendancy of say the Federal Reserve‚Ä¶ are helpless.Something else- the feedback loop may also be broken for 2 other reasons;  1) not a lack of information but a deluge and too high a floor of noise for signal to rise above it and 2) It‚Äôs not possible in a 2 million square mile continental sized Federation with 330 million people like America to actually process the information at a central point.   That‚Äôs why any successful American administration is mostly local.

        Just for the heck of it I typed ‚ÄúLiz Cheney‚Äù into Google and saw dozens of recent articles. She is still out there talking about Orange Man Bad and muh January 6. She‚Äôs even on the Sunday morning talk show circuit, which is normally reserved for relevant politicians. Remember, this is a person who lost a Wyoming primary by over 30 points. An incumbent losing a primary by 30 points is basically mathematically impossible considering the way these elections are rigged for incumbents these days. It should not even be possible for the daughter of a prominent Wyoming politician, as evil and Sith-like he may be. To lose an election like this, you have to be one of the worst politicians of all time, and completely and totally disconnected from the people you claim to represent.Yet, does the fact that she was totally rebuked by her constituents matter? Not at all. If anything, it‚Äôs a badge of honor for her, the fact that the dirty Wyoming peasants in her district hate her so much is just a sign that she‚Äôs on the right side.

            She shows up in my homepage news feed almost daily. Somebody really wants us to see and hear her. Speaking of things that show up in my homepage, this recently did:
https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/wellness/black-americans-need-320-years-to-achieve-equality-with-white-people-in-living-standards/ss-BB1hSkLP#image=1
That‚Äôs based on a ‚Äústudy‚Äù by McKinsey &amp; Co. I would think they wouldn‚Äôt want to propagate this info too much, as it could lead to waning enthusiasm for the project among whites. Yet there it was.

                I read an article from what could be considered a sociologist from back in the late 30‚Äôs dealing with that very subject.His take was that brain-wise, the average black was 10,000 years behind the average White in cognitive development.

        The real threat to the cloud people may be from other cloud people. The Dirt tend to be sheep.The Great Reset and Replacement are mainly Jewish. A high level cloud person like Musk, in spite of his recent and predictable groveling to the Jews, openly states that much of what is going on is insane.The Jews hate us and want to destroy normal life. However insane plans like you will own nothing and be happy will be disastrous for fabulously wealthy companies like Apple and Amazon. Tesla too. The 10 minutes city will be great for Amazon but not Tesla and all the auto companies.They want to eliminate plane travel for the dirt. How will the airlines deal with that? ‚ÄúWell, we support Mother Gaia so we‚Äôll just go out of business?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so.They are very clear about wanting to kill off agriculture but all these things compound. One of my favorite ones is to limit people to 3 articles of clothing a year. There goes the fashion industry.Jews always double down and that is their weakness.

            You lack vision, dirt man.Elon is a similarly old-fashioned guy, the ‚Äúcountry mouse‚Äù of the oligarchs. His trad-supervillain vision requires that after he destroys civilization, chips our brains and zaps them into shape via his ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù social-credit system etc., there be *something left of humanity* to look like garbage in comparison to his gold and whores‚Äîa meaningfully defeated, recognizably human loser population that his status lets him avoid (and monitor down to the last synapse).His meta-predatory peers like Gates and Soros demand total, eternal death, the end of everything forever. God will see that the end has their name on it‚Äîand thereby prove Himself worthy of existence.

            I used to represent Marmon Group. At one of their social functions, a Pritzker and I were kibbitzing. I asked him the secret to sustained business success. He responded bluntly, ‚Äúwatch the Godfather movies ‚Ä¶ I am Michael Corleone.‚Äù I chatted up another Pritzker and the person also quite seriously injected a Godfather reference into our discussion about business. This family owns my adopted state. They think like mobsters, I am not joking. It‚Äôs par for many of the juice I interact with. They have no moral limitations on behavior unless it‚Äôs not good for their families or the tribe. I was raised in a liberal Episcopal church; I did not become a juice hater until after my professional career matured and I was routinely exposed to the juice. I cannot unhear or unsee what I have witnessed. I hate them.

                I wish I could say I was surprised that they model themselves on the Godfather but that is probably their polite external description. I wonder what they say among themselves?
Unfortunately, it shows why whites were so easily conquered. American Whites traditionally are high trust and just want to be left alone. Whites were sitting ducks

                Valid point, but I am not going to rip on Derb. I have been reading him since his National Review days. He is something of a polymath, and quite witty and intelligent.But yeah, it‚Äôs odd how many of these ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù who oppose immigration like Brimelow and Derb are immigrants themselves. Derb is a ‚Äúrace realist‚Äù but only about blacks. My guess is that Derb is basically an old British imperialist-type who ‚Äúwent native‚Äù with his Chinese wife ‚Äî who is rather good-looking for her (and his!) age.I think those old British guys see the world as either part of the English-speaking commonwealth, or not, and in terms of racial hierarchy (correctly) see Asians as closer to whites but blacks as untermenschen.

                    . Derb is a ‚Äúrace realist‚Äù but only about blacks‚ÄîLet‚Äôs face it, we all are.  I mean yeah we care about racial politics beyond that but no one is white-flighting because too many Japanese move in somewhere.  We‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt, we‚Äôd rather they stayed in their own country, but the genetic distance isn‚Äôt like it is with blacks (or low-level mestizos).Put another way, if you warp 100 years in the future and everyone in the U.S. looks like Derb‚Äôs kids you‚Äôll feel one way, if they all look like Kamala Harris you‚Äôll feel‚Ä¶a different way.  Neither way is what I might call ‚Äúhappy‚Äù, but, it would be different.

            Does the Derb fall into the camp of colorblind civic nationalism, aka Citizenism, or does he advocate for whites to join the identity politics game?
If the former, why does Derb believe that following a strategy that has utterly failed for 50+ years will somehow be successful in the future and how would he convince non-whites and Jews to stop their participation in identity politics when it‚Äôs been so successful for them?
If the latter, how does Derb think that whites should organize when even the slightest hint of white identity politics draws the full firepower of the ruling elite?

            Ask him about his superb novel, Fire from the Sun.  Specifically, why he decided to make the main male character a gay man. It does work, sort of, but I think the novel would have had more appeal if the character was a straight man.

            When the chosen got caught on the wrong side of DEI, Derb (and Jared) believed that this was whites‚Äô chance to persuade some significant fraction of the chosen to oppose anti-white policies because most non-whites see them as white.
Instead, they are carving out exemptions for themselves from DEI.  Further, many prominent tribesman, like John Podhoretz for example, clearly said, ‚Äúwe are not white.‚Äù
Was he wrong in his hope?  It looks like anti-whiteness a non-negotiable part of their group identity.  Response?

        The reason that this system of insane moves by the cloud people keeps happening is it works.The cloud people get wealthier and wealthier and gain more power. Soon with CBDC and AI they can control every aspect of people‚Äôs lives and mercilessly punish them for any infraction.There is also the aspect that many of the key rulers are from a hostile tribe that really hates us, Palestinians and Russians thus the domestic war and the two international ones.The cloud people can be summed up with the old Lily Tomlin joke: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care. We don‚Äôt have to. We are the phone company.‚ÄùLike the phone company the cloud may be broken up but things are still good enough and most people still have too much to lose to rebel. The cloud people are determined to make the masses as miserable as possible so that may change.

                        England was only nominally royalist and in actuality was an economic oligarchy. Their fleet and their isolation from Europe protected them from the French armies and allowed them to organize the successful anti-Bonaparte coalition. Although Nappy went down to defeat, the French revolutionaries actually succeeded in the long run and the conservative monarchies of Europe were all abolished or neutered and replaced with liberal republics (the monarchs in those de facto republics are mere figureheads).

The GAE could walk away from Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan under the guise that ‚Äúwe could have whipped em if we wanted to but we have better things to do,‚Äù but re: Ukraine no such illusions can be propagated.The Kagans may have other motives, but for the top clouds, above them, this is about the dollar.

Which appears impossible.Reading reviews of Emmanuel Todd‚Äôs new book, I see he made the point that GAE clouds seceded from AINO a long time ago. I would say circa 1990. For them it‚Äôs just a vehicle to be driven until it runs out of gas. Back then, maybe they thought it never would run out. More recently they probably still thought so. It appears they don‚Äôt have another vehicle on standby and things have come to a head before they‚Äôve been able to locate one. So they are by necessity all in for Ukraine and the dollar.

            If they need military supremacy to to maintain their dollar economy then why have they worked so diligently to destroy the military?
The ZMan has pointed out that many of them are true believers.  Do they really think that a rainbow military with weapons mostly produced to move funds to the right people and not to win wars is going to help with that?

                Assuming competency is probably a mistake. I would say yes, they most likely do, or at least did, believe the rainbow military would be just as good. Bear in mind that few of the clouds have ever spent much time around negros. Making them more susceptible to believing the most fanciful notions about them. And if one is a fan of homo marriage and trannies, then obviously one is given to believing all kinds of fanciful things.For a great many years, they just took GAE military supremacy for granted. To them it was like a black box (since they never participated in it) that was there ready to do their bidding whenever called upon. How it gained and maintained that supremacy was not their concern. It just ‚Äúwas.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt say this has worn off yet either, although they have to be aware of industrial/logistical shortcomings.

                In their minds, they are not destroying it.  They are foolishly relying on tech to save the day.  They don‚Äôt need competent soldiers because drones, etc. will do the fighting.I‚Äôm no military expert, but seems to me for some sorts of war, that may be true ‚Äì i.e., smash and declare victory.  Not so sure it would work if actual territory needs to be taken and controlled.For example, compare the Houthis success in disrupting the GAE.  No territory needed, in fact no actual casualties needed.  Seems merely the risk of damage is all it took to raise the cost of war for the GAE.On the other hand, the Gaza/Israel war, and the Ukr/Russia war shows that, while drones and tech, etc. are involved, you still need boots on the ground to take and hold territory.

            Personal belief of mine is that sound currency can be built on at least three things:1. a strong economy (real, not fake ‚Äì we have/make things you want)2. strong trust in the political environment (basically, the Swiss model ‚Äì your $$ is safe here and we won‚Äôt steal it or give it to others and is available upon request)3. Force (accept our money or we kill you, or in the case of the petrodollar, we control by force what you want ‚Äì hints of #1)The last remaining of these for the ZOG is #3, and it is fading fast.

        I don‚Äôt know. It is also hard to know because you can‚Äôt follow all of the channels through which information filters. You can at times get lucky and fall upon the correct channels for a given episode.That happened to me yesterday when I saw a story that Sharpton was on CNN with some Connecticut based Great Replacement sponsor. I think he is a Connecticut Senator which means he represents hedge funds and financialization rackets. He went on to plug the bill and the CNN propaganda facilitator, (a.k.a. show host), then lined up Sharpton to scream, ‚ÄúThis is an invasion! You must pass this bill to stop this invasion. Anyone who votes against this bill is voting for the invasion!‚ÄùHere is the deal. The system is bent on dispossessing white America and it is a full court press. In its place it has created a coalition of patronage groups. The primary group getting the most play are blacks in America. This is why they dominate commercials, their national anthem is the new anthem, their months and days are the new national holidays ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ This incident is Sharpton out to try and bamboozle that constituency for the Ruling Regime. Blacks in America are now pissed off about the aliens landing in their neighborhoods and getting better gibz. Sharpton‚Äôs job is to tell White shitlibs and these blacks that this bill will stop the invasion and to get in line and support the bill. If the bill does not pass it is Whitey‚Äôs fault for messing around and permitting his neighborhoods to keep getting invaded.In other words, this bill is the Ruling Regime basically saying ‚Äì We give you nothing. We do want we want and you can suck it. Just like White America, who we feel no compunction about lying to and gaslighting, we have no compunction about lying to and gaslighting blacks in America and turning them into chumps and blaming Whitey who opposes the invasion for supporting the invasion.In other words, the Ruling Regime is full out brazen. They don‚Äôt answer to anyone anymore. They do what they want, and they will use the propaganda organs to lie to anyone and everyone and they will contradict yesterday‚Äôs lie with today‚Äôs lie as many times as they like. It is chaos. This is the Grand Arch Demon‚Äôs satrapy to do with what he wants now. He‚Äôs got the power and the Dirt People and even any non supplicant Cloud People can pound sand.

            That‚Äôs quite plausible. Sharpton is shaking his money maker for the highest bidder, and the financial houses would be a good suspect. Also, TPTB are indeed ruling by brute force now. That‚Äôs not a good long-term strategy but it does work in the interim.

        I want to believe that we are smarter than just standing on the sidelines waiting for the pressure cooker to explode. But that is the current reality. Normie‚Äôs ass is glued to the sofa and only a change in his immediate environment will motivate real action. He sees the carrot of a Trump election as his salvation and opens another bag of Doritos. It never occurs to him that the fatness of his ass is what dooms him when the shit starts flying. There is way too much deadfall waiting on a match and when the conflagration begins, the resultant violence with be extremely local, especially in the big cities. And this carnage will be largely confined to the bottom of the social pyramid, where it will it do absolutely nothing to address the root of the  problem.There is a better way. It begins with the fog of chaos, and out of this fog must arise the antibodies; numerous, dispersed, invisible in their benign blandness. And everything solely within the confines of your cranium. When the elites destroyed all social trust, they enabled the means of their own destruction. Poetic justice methinks.

                In the old Soviet Union, the dirt people learned to speak in code both publicly and privately with friends and family. That evolved as the only safe way to communicate in a world where anyone could be a spy for State and giving trust was risky business that might result in a vacation to the gulag. As a result of modern technology, this problem is an order of magnitude worse in current life. Yes it‚Äôs sad, and it seriously undermines the peaceful creation of grassroots movements, but reality doesn‚Äôt care about your emotions. They hate you and want you dead.

                    Wow.  Brings back memories.  Way long ago, Robert White was at our medical school.  He was famous for cutting off dog heads and reattaching them to other dogs.  Here‚Äôs his Wiki bio:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._WhiteI was a student taking continuing education credits, so attended his presentation.  I thought it was pretty neat.  However, seems even in those days, we had a large antivivisection med student population.All hell broke loose in the surgery auditorium.  Students in lab coats screaming and challenging his ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù as meaningless and worse, immoral.  I must say that 50 years later, I remember little of the science he produced, but all of the entertainment.In any event, you could keep a head alive then and I imagine with drug development and heart-lung equipment, alive and conscious for quite awhile if not indefinitely.  üòâ

        I think that I‚Äôve cleared something up in my mind, so I‚Äôm going to repost something that I just wrote. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out the relationship between our real rulers and the Cloud people that we see every day, and I think that I have it ‚Äì at least in my own mind, so here it is:I tend to see it as the (((bankers))) hire the Cloud people. Basically, the bankers are like producers and directors of a reality show while the Cloud people are the cast of the show. Granted, the Cloud people are only vaguely aware that they‚Äôre just cast members on a reality show, but that‚Äôs what they are.The producers and directors push the show in certain directions but let the cast do their thing so long as it fits what the producers and directors want. It‚Äôs not as though the cast members aren‚Äôt real or that they don‚Äôt have power within the confines of the show. Indeed, if they become popular enough, it becomes difficult for the producers and directors to tell them what to do up to a point.However, if a member of the cast or the whole cast goes way off what the producers and directors want, they will be put back into the place or even replaced.What we‚Äôre seeing is an elaborate reality show.So, the question isn‚Äôt whether the Cloud people (the cast) know what the Dirt People are thinking? It‚Äôs whether the producers and directors of the show know or care.

            Btw, I should say that I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs only Jews as the producers and directors, but they‚Äôre a large portion and the only producers and directors that are organized as a group and loyal to that group, which gives them a huge advantage over the other producers and directors.

            A lot of people don‚Äôt agree, and this includes you based on your comment, but I think it is the inverse: the Tribe is the junior partner of the Puritan Clouds. That is based on the assumption that the Puritans have the monopoly on state power and can liquidate their junior partners at will. As far as I know, the Joint Chiefs don‚Äôt include any Christian Zionists let alone Tribe members. Bribes only go so far if money can be taken outright when the time comes.

                There‚Äôs no way the tribe is the junior partner. Just look at Biden‚Äôs cabinet.
Also, our military is zero threat to the tribe.
The Puritans aren‚Äôt organized, nor do they have ethnic loyalty.

                    Also keeping with their culture, the tribe are bosses and managers.  The military, even those of very high rank, are considered the hired help by the ‚Äútribe.‚Äù    As you say the military is no threat to the them.

                    The true patricians are only loyal to their class.  Randolph and Mortimer Duke don‚Äôt invite merchants to their dinner parties.  At the end of the day, as powerful as they are, to the blue-bloods they‚Äôll always be hairy little hand-rubbing merchants.  Which is fun to think about because:a) that must really annoy them, andb) it‚Äôll drive them over the edge eventually

                Jack, because lots of smart people of good faith disagree about who has the whip hand, I look for evidence that can clarify the chain of command.  I tend to agree with our Silly Citizen, but I‚Äôm willing to change my mind.(Caveats:  the chain of command can change over time and sometimes the ones in control can lose on a particular issue while still being on top.)Doesn‚Äôt the fact that the non-whites who criticize the Gaza genocide got decisively defeated demonstrate that the tribe is at the helm?Doesn‚Äôt the fact that almost every politician with national ambitions must kneel at the wailing wall or visit a holocaust museum show that the tribe calls the tune?

                    Yep. If the military or the old WASP elite had any say at all, we would have forced Israel into a cease-fire. We also wouldn‚Äôt have gone all in on Ukr.
The Puritans are more focused on China than Russia or the Middle East. The Jews also have issues with China but are more focused on Ukr and Israel for obvious personal reasons.

                        Is the military fully onboard Project Ukraine, though? That seems more the handiwork and project of the intelligence services. The Jews got royally slapped down by China but it still more or less runs the political class in D.C., which sanctions it very little.
I also note that Israel has not participated in the sanctions against Russia. What to make of that, I don‚Äôt know.

                        Jack,
The Pentagon wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt on board with Project Ukr, which tells you that they do what they‚Äôre told.
As to Israel, Israeli Jews and Americans Jews don‚Äôt always see eye to eye, though it‚Äôs still fairly rare and they‚Äôll close ranks at the first sign of trouble. But Israeli Jews are easier to deal with. They have some understanding of having to look after the country in which they live.

                    The Tribe attained their status via control of ‚ÄúThe Media,‚Äù which has become surprisingly hostile to Israel in some quarters. Obama, particularly, and Biden, to a lesser extent, purged the media and inserted leftists as officers, almost all of whom are hostile to Israel (there are reports of grumbling over the Red Sea situation). The pop culture is becoming less Jewish although that is admittedly happening from a point of total domination.I agree in part with Citizen, as he said in disagreement, that the Puritans have no ethnic loyalty, but they do have a class and caste loyalty that is as strong as ever. Institutional power trumps money even though it obviously requires it. I‚Äôm watching the Harvard situation closely because while Ackman got his way, it came at a great cost and my money is on the Puritans exacting revenge and regaining total control of that institution.I agree that dominant groups come and go, but I simply don‚Äôt think Jews ever were at the pinnacle. We are seeing money denied Israel and the ADL criticized quite a bit of late, Musk‚Äôs groveling aside. Those are Puritan power plays.

                    I agree that the Finkels are in charge, but I also believe there‚Äôs no way they could have destroyed America without the help of the Kennedys, Rockefellers and Carnegies. Who holds the whip is really beside the point. The fact of the matter is that the Judeo-Puritan combine proved an irresistable and cataclysmic force. And if there is a reckoning, both must pay.

                        While I think the Puritans still have the whip hand, there is no doubt they used Jews as weapons against the Untermensch. If I am wrong on who is still in charge, there certainly have been many cases of hostile takeovers where the folks in charge thought they were more clever and devious than they were.
If there ever is a reckoning, you are absolutely right about the punishment.

                    I would argue a synthesis: Kabbalah. The esoteric teachings and views on alchemy, golems, self/Satanic worship, money/power, all seem to align nicely. In this sense, Israel and Zionism are seen as components, albeit a lesser component in the grand scheme of their beliefs, of a wider belief system.

                    You are correct.  The ongoing slaughter of innocent Gazans has been a clarifying event.  The anti-semites have basically been proven to be correct, not a bunch of fringe lunatics.
Do the anti-semites sometimes go too far?  Yes, and when they do, it helps (((them))) immensely.  But no one can now credibly argue that all anti-semitism is just for nutjobs and hateful racists.

                    I remember (many years ago) reading a transcript of a senate subcommittee meeting. It was a bunch of WASP‚Äôs in the late 1960‚Äôs. I think Fulbright was one of them.I don‚Äôt remember which subcommittee because they weren‚Äôt talking about what they were supposed to be talking about, but rather discussing the fact they had just lost control over America to Jews. They didn‚Äôt come right out and say it, but it was clear to me at the time that they were referring to losing control over the money system (manufacture and distribution) that determined political behavior in Washington DC. We have pretty much always had a system of legalized bribery.My take is that they didn‚Äôt know what to do about it. Vietnam was underway and not going well. Their political cohesion had been taking body blows for decades. They really couldn‚Äôt do much about it.The WASP‚Äôs had not taken the warning signs seriously (Jews don‚Äôt have a monopoly on arrogance as a besetting sin), and by the time they realized they were under terminal attack, they had already decisively lost. Implicit or not, it appears that the Jews gave the WASP‚Äôs a deal: don‚Äôt challenge us for primacy and you can continue to make staggering fat stacks of cash. Just don‚Äôt even think about using that money to organize your goy tribe against us to depose us as the senior ‚Äòpartner‚Äô or we will cut you out of the herd and destroy you. The vast majority of mid/late 20 century WASP‚Äôs were money-grubbing whores in nice suits. They took the deal to the ruin of all.

            On a final note, I‚Äôm wondering if some of the upcoming Cloud people are chaffing at being only reality stars. People like King Cobra and JD Vance don‚Äôt seem too happy to take on that role.
I‚Äôm also wondering if some other the upcoming non-Jewish producers and directors are chaffing at being subordinate to the Jewish producers and directors. You can definitely see that happening internationally. China, Russia, India and Iran want nothing to do with the whole show and want to have their own networks, which isn‚Äôt pleasing GAE.

        The cloud people who should be closest to the pulse of the dirt people are the very important set on the boards of major banks and hedge funds.  Particularly people like Jamie Dimon.  They‚Äôve always had an oversized voice in D.C. given their roles.  While I see blurbs here and there about their unhappiness, along with some other large hedge fund operators, it‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôve had their wings clipped in D.C.  This will sound absurd, but this really comes down to the D.C. cloud people, who actually have their hands on the levers, no longer even understanding money as a concept.  Like a four year old opening the kitchen faucet and just knowing the water is there for them in unlimited quantities.  You could explain the network of pipes and pumps and electricity it takes to get them that water, which came from somewhere else.   They wouldn‚Äôt get it.  It‚Äôs easier for the hedge fund guy to buy a house in New Zealand and have a NetJet account to get there quickly, than to explain to the D.C. crowd people why they‚Äôre playing with fire which only upsets them and causes them to storm out of the room.While most of the cloud people will come together in any peasant revolt.  At least a few of them know what‚Äôs happening.  These same people  were more attached places like Zurich than St. Louis anyway, so they‚Äôll have the idea that they can pull a scene like the Havana new years eve of 1959, where some of the wealthiest Cubans, knowing exactly what was going on, flew to Miami after midnight as Castro was coming down the hills.

        ‚ÄúSomehow, official Washington convinced themselves that bundling Israel money, Ukraine money and open borders money was a winning formula with the Dirt People.‚ÄùNot denying Z-man‚Äôs insight posted today.  However, I‚Äôm not as enlightened‚Äîor as smart‚Äîas Z-man.  To me, the elites simply pulled a common trick out of the hat, which was to ‚Äúname‚Äù the bill something palatable and deceptive, i.e., Immigration Reform Act, then do something completely different within.This is the current level of disrespect they have for the Dirt people, i.e., Dirt people are an ignorant mob/nuisance with short memories.  Certainly it worked for Biden when he passed the Inflation Reduction Act that sent a minor reopening inflation blip into the stratosphere!  Why not do it again 2 years later?This time around however, it seems that the Dirt people‚Äôs suffering has brought about a wonderful ‚Äúfocusing of the mind‚Äù wrt same old, same old from Washington.  Certainly, from day one, the radio pundits rallied the mob with insight as to this common trick‚Äîfalse title, multiple funding efforts, secrecy, etc.The trick was revealed and the bill killed within a few days of release.  Even  predictions were made as to the political shenanigans that would now occur and Biden, the old demented fool, was right on schedule blaming Trump and MAGA zombies for immigration failure‚Äîwhich of course the bill never addressed in the first place outside of its title.I think this is progress of a sort.

            Yes, they actually thought it could pass without too much uproar. That degree of insularity is terrifying. I think the open borders have radicalized more people, including core Democrat/Uniparty constituencies, than the inflation has. At a minimum, this threw gasoline on the fire.
Also recall that W attempted to do the same thing and the public revolted then, too, and it was scuttled. That‚Äôs been almost twenty years ago, and it is somewhat pleasing to see there still are things outside of starvation and cold that can provoke the Dirt folks.

                        The Nuggras may be straying from the plantation a bit here. They think the current situation, where whitey worships the negro, is a pretty good deal and they don‚Äôt want it to change. They fear, and perhaps with some justification, that if AINO is overwhelmed by other PoC, and whitey is thoroughly dispossessed, the country will cease its negrolatry. Whitey is easily bullied into groveling before the Numinous Negro. Those brownskins from Chichen Itza may be less impressed by slam dunks and the guttural racket known as rap.

                        @Ostei:
There is a precedent: the Liberty City riots in 1980. These initially started over four Cuban cops being acquitted of assaulting a black, but intensified with the Marielito boat immivasion. Blacks already were being squeezed out of Miami and that was just fuel on the fire.
It doesn‚Äôt take a tinfoil hat to believe the NGO‚Äôs started to push Sub-Saharans and Haitians across the border not to celebrate diversity but so as not to upset the colored folks as much. It didn‚Äôt work but it was a good theory.

                        Ostei, precisely!  Sharpton and others of the Black grifter class know that they (Blacks) are next in line when Whites decline into meaningless/powerless minority status.  The worst thing for Blacks and their race baiter handlers would be a majority Hispanic community.  We‚Äôve already seen how the Hispanic community handled Blacks in Compton.  Minority communities will not put up with Black dysfunction as have Whites.

                Jack:  I don‚Äôt think they counted on the blaqs resenting the mestizos getting so much of what they regard as ‚Äòtheir‚Äô gibs.  And the fact that the elites don‚Äôt see or understand that level of ethnic competition and racial loyalty amongst/between non-Whites is both funny and frightening.  We know they despise us, and we know they have no reason to worry about a White middle-class uprising in the short-term.  But their blindness extending to non-White competition and turf battles (both political and financial) is what is striking.Note:  I don‚Äôt confuse this non-White competition with any sort of genuine sea change or even temporary allieship ‚Äì unlike gayway pundit who‚Äôs always pushing based blaqs.

        The best recent example of the detachment you describe happened while Liz Truss was prime minister in the UK. With a facial expression of total satisfaction, she used the term ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs inflation‚Äù to describe the rising prices there and throughout the West. You could almost imagine the ‚ÄúEureka‚Äù moment when that phrase was coined by the Managerial Elite. Despite it being such low-hanging fruit, the opposition MP‚Äôs nodded right along in full agreement.British subjects paying exorbitant prices understandably didn‚Äôt buy a word of it, of course. Such scenes also played out in America and the rest of the West, and eventually the term fell into disuse, whether because it polled badly or was forgotten I don‚Äôt know.Even so, as long as houses are warm and bellies are full (too full, actually), this farcical clownshow will go on. Once people get cold and hungry, it will collapse in a nanosecond. You would hope there is a smart faction that realizes there are limits to the fuckery, but that seems not to be the case‚Ä¶Revolutionary France did not have nukes, but it has them now. You can make proper and safe assumptions about what that means.

            The reason the term ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs inflation‚Äù has stopped is because people are stupid. They have already forgotten about the spike in prices and adjusted unconsciously towards an increasingly crappy lifestyle. Inflation is now forgotten. Channel has changed, and so has their pathetic attention span. I fractured my leg a few years ago. At first, I noticed the pain intensely. It continued to hurt for a while. But, after a while, the pain became a dull ache largely forgotten. So with Normie. This does not bode well for the prospects of a peasant revolt.To be clear, I agree with your point about the origin and the fact people‚Äôs bellies are too full. That is why they have forgotten about inflation, for money has always been an elusive, in flux concept for them. Most have lived paycheck to paycheck for year. What this means is most feel rich the moment they get paid, and then they feel poor after they spend it, until the next cycle. This is why only the middle class, the true middle class, one which builds wealth and savings, are feeling it. We are the minority. The mindless masses are insensible.

                Excellent comment. I upvoted you even though I disagree with the central premise. I don‚Äôt think it has been forgotten at all, and that will be evidenced when people lose jobs or have their hours and gibs cut. The dull toothache analogy is close to reality, to be sure, but awareness of it is still there.

                    Besides your close circle of people, probably of a stable financial situation, do you hear anything beyond ‚ÄúThings are more expensive!‚Äù ejaculated? They may have a spasmodic occasional reaction when that nerve is hit (to follow the pain metaphor), but they do not think of it in a way that 1)Changes their lifestyle, and 2) Changes their outlook. Note that you even say they it will be shown when they lose their job, etc. I agree. But I am saying that they are not aware of it in the way we are ‚Äì the slow nibble away of our wealth.Allow me to phrase it in this manner: What could the average Normie living paycheck to paycheck say about it, beyond a brief utterance of curses? Not much. That is how long they can stay attuned to it. The reason is that their lifestyles have not been altered because the proportions may have been shifted, but the fundamental lifestyle is still the same (e.g. ‚ÄúI am 500 bucks short this month, as opposed to 400 last month).My wife and I try to pack away 2 grand a month. We feel the impact because we have been forced to alter our habits (though, to be fair, we were always pretty frugal). The ones on Tiktok whining about inflation were the same ones whining about a living wage 3 years ago. Their circumstances and views have not been altered. Thus, their awareness of inflation is minimal.To revisit my opening point, when have you heard someone outside your circle mention inflation besides in a passing comment, and extremely infrequently? For the morons, inflation is just a word that means I cannot buy everything I want in order to be happy. They have long held this position. We know the difference; they do not.When the belly rumbles, sure. But then what will they do, except what they have always done: Beg for the Gods to save them ‚Äì in this case, Big Gub.

            &gt; Speaking of out of touch elites, Trump is going to do a Superbowl commercial for friggin Bud Lite!!!
So they‚Äôre paying our allies and putting his face up there as a positive spokesperson? Honestly, this sounds like Bud bending the knee to me.

        I think it‚Äôs even sillier (and thus more terrifying) than that. I think the whole bill was Failure Theater for both parties. I posit that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúcompetent fraction‚Äù (for evil clown values of ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù) inside the Apparat. They realize that Projekt Ukraine has failed. They‚Äôre also facing a revolt from one of their core constituencies, the Diverse politicians in places like NY and Chicongo, over illegal immigration.This ‚Äúcompetent fraction‚Äù is setting up the standard Media narrative for any Leftist failure: ‚ÄúRepublican intransigence.‚Äù Once again, we were thiiiiiis close to Utopia, and once again, ‚ÄúRepublican intransigence‚Äù doomed it. By rolling it all into an omnibus bill ‚Äî and making that bill so onerous that no one could possibly support it ‚Äî all the Republicans were supposed to make principled noises as they voted ‚Äúnay,‚Äù and then the Media would roll out their pre-scripted Narratives: There are Russian tanks in Keeeeve, and MS-13 controls Chicago now, because ‚ÄúRepublican intransigence‚Äù killed the necessary blah blah blah.The problem is, the Republicans are so goddamn dumb, and so accustomed to / sexually aroused by getting rolled by the Democrats, that they were gonna pass it anyway ‚Äî thus Glitchy Mitch the Left‚Äôs Bitch having to take to the airwaves to urge everyone to vote against his own bill. (‚ÄúThe shame is part of the kink,‚Äù remember).And now they‚Äôrereallystuck, because any proposed  legislation that might accomplish something in their own interests would be ‚Äúhanding MAGA a win,‚Äù and that‚Äôs unpossible.

            I do think there is some cult service going on with this. ‚ÄúIt is not your fault comrades. The evil ones are to blame.‚Äù I agree that the open borders people had nothing to gain and nothing to lose from this deal, so tying it to a bunch of other stuff did not matter to them. What is puzzling is the neocons were the ones who cooked up this scheme to tie Ukraine money to an open borders bill. If you want to play 4-D chess, look for whoever assigned that simpleton Lankford to be the point man on the bill. That guy better hire a food taster.

            There is a good chance that they sent this crap sandwich for it to be shot down, and they‚Äôll return with another bill that is another crap sandwich, but not quite as bad. The staunch resisters will hem and haw, say ‚Äúwell, we got some of what we wanted‚Äù and pass it.

        I‚Äôm not 100% sure that the Cloud people don‚Äôt know what the Dirt people are thinking. They just don‚Äôt care. Why should they? For at least 50 years, our rulers have been able to either manipulate or ignore the Dirt people with zero consequences. Indeed, they‚Äôve become even more powerful.Perhaps, the Ukr/Israel/border bill wasn‚Äôt due to ignorance but more a middle finger to a powerless people. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do about it, Dirt people? Nothing, that‚Äôs what.‚ÄùAnd you know what. They‚Äôre right. Sure, the bill won‚Äôt get through the House for now. But they‚Äôll still get their money for Ukr one way or the other. And if they don‚Äôt, well, they‚Äôre still in charge and will go on another adventure in a few years.As to Dirt people not understanding the Cloud people, it‚Äôs more a question of understanding that they hate you and view you as cattle.There is no reforming the system because the system is run by a foreign elite who view themselves special ‚Äì chosen if you will ‚Äì and the rest of us as beasts of burden who need to used to produce things and cared for as stupid children. I don‚Äôt even buy completely into the ‚ÄúCloud people‚Äù idea as I think that they are mostly just house ni$$ers for the real power.The French Revolution was a struggle between the French nobility and a rising French bourgeois class ‚Äì but they were both French. Our struggle is more between a small colonial force which rules by money, manipulation, bribery and occasional violence and what is now a collection of tribes. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre never allowed to say who rules us because once they‚Äôre fingered, people will demand accountability.Once you know who rules us, the strange behavior of the Cloud people actually makes a lot of sense.

Precisely. No consequences. A bit of grumbling from the hoi polloi. But no action. And for diversion from the travails of everyday life in the USA, there‚Äôs fentanyl, television, social media, professional sports.
But outside the USA, the cloud people are discovering there are consequences. Foreign powers hit back.

            Last week they were doing the victory marches around the EU screwing over the Europeans and passing a 50 billion Ukraine aid deal.   So what do the Ukies need our money for anyway?They do not care what we think on any subject. We are completely irrelevant.  Our opinions on the matter were neither sought nor considered.  They will do whatever it is they want to do.Though I haven‚Äôt read it, the alt-hype did a podcast on a study that was done about public opinion and the policies enacted by the government.  There was a negative correlation between what the public wants and what policies are enacted.  IOW, the more we want something, the less likely we are to get it.

        Well, the first American Revolution was a revolution from above. John Hancock and George Washington were two of the richest men in the colonies. Nearly all of the Declaration signers were wealthy, prominent men. The southerners were planters (generally) and the northerners were merchants, landlords and shipowners etc.So when the second one comes, it will likely also come from the top. One group of elites will decide the other is bad for business and turf them out. The Dirts will have little to do with instigating it, although their support will be critical for it to succeed.It‚Äôs going to take a financial crisis for this to happen. (That‚Äôs what happened in France). We‚Äôre not getting a revolt with the stock market at all-time highs.

Diamonds have been revealed for the scam they‚Äôve always been (a much larger supply than most people ever realized, with the flow very carefully controlled).  And lab-grown diamonds are now almost indistinguishable ‚Äì same carbon, same pressure, same shiny pretty rock . . . far lower price point.  Same goes for fancy Swiss watches ‚Äì drop in value.  This is not to say some people aren‚Äôt still buying ‚Äòluxury‚Äù items ‚Äì but the people with real money and power aren‚Äôt the nuggras buying branded pleather handbags.Even though the price of precious metals is volatile, consider the volume instead, and who is buying and how much.  And yes, the Silver Institute has its own self-interest, but far more silver is necessary for modern industrial uses (not just electronics) than people realize. Berkshire Hathaway owns 130 million troy ounces of silver.  There is definitely profit taking going on, but the powers behind the professional cloud people are not liquidating their metals holdings.  Neither is Russia, nor any other serious nation.While commercial real estate may be in the toilet, US  housing prices are not dropping significantly.  Yes, there could well be a repeat of 2008, but I‚Äôm not talking about people buying standard stick-built house in the ‚Äòburbs with almost nothing down.  Those who can afford to buy are looking for ‚Äúgood schools‚Äù (i.e. Whiter neighborhoods) and those are ever fewer.  And the people with genuine wealth are buying land ‚Äì and lots of it ‚Äì and the more remote from the hoi polloi the better.  Yes, they‚Äôll still vacation in Portofino, but they tend to buy homes where there aren‚Äôt so many ‚Äòdiverse‚Äô inhabitants on the streets.  Again ‚Äì I‚Äôm not talking Hollywood thots or rich nuggras, I‚Äôm talking about the people with money and genuine political and/or industrial/banking/business power and clout.Point of all that being:  The stock market doesn‚Äôt measure a whole lot of things that matter.  A lot of people seem to lack confidence in the economy longer-term (and whether that means 5 months or 5 years I cannot say), and know just how much inflation really is.  I don‚Äôt believe that Joe Q. Normiecon is going to get off the couch anytime soon, but a lot of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù are genuinely hurting economically.  And they are not measured by the Dow Jones, and no one knows  precisely what  will rouse them ‚Äì but the regime seems peculiarly concerned about some of those dirts.

        One needn‚Äôt look so far afield for historical analogues. There were multiple points leading up to the American Revolution where the Monarchy could have deescalated rather than ramping things up. Great Britain was in straits‚Äîor at least overextended‚Äîafter the Seven Years War, and so had to levy taxes on their colonial holdings. But they didn‚Äôt have to make them so onerous, force citizens to house soldiers, impose taxes on wood so that paper became too expensive for printing (the 18th century version of installing internet kill switches.) It‚Äôs not even as if the feedback mechanisms you speak of didn‚Äôt exist back then; spies have always existed and the people in charge have always been able to get a sense of what‚Äôs actually going on outside the walls if they care to do so. Regime outlets have disabled comments specifically to ensure the windows of their ‚Äúblack box‚Äù stay tinted. Maybe you can still call in to those Sunday morning C-Span shows, and voice discontent, but that‚Äôs about it.I don‚Äôt think this bill is a sign that our rulers are out of touch. I think it‚Äôs a throwing down of the gauntlet, the legislative equivalent of Kevin Williamson‚Äôs infamous ‚ÄúF Off and Die‚Äù article, ‚ÄúDonald Trump and the White Working Class.‚Äù They‚Äôve decided that the demoralization of their enemies (us) plus the inertial force of the border flooding will be enough to actually break us now, once and for all. They can pretty much explicitly admit what they want us to do, which, again, is to die.They may be right about this being their moment. Going out now, I see more and more very Indio-Mestizo featured little guys and gals walking around with stars in their eyes, looking at the stocked shelves of the grocery stores and malls as if it were Disneyland. It‚Äôs looking weird out there, so weird even black people and our garden variety Hispanics are looking at me confused, wondering what‚Äôs going on. Schumer, et. al., are of course grateful. These new constituents really just expect three hots and a cot per day, and maybe less than that. You could probably pay some of these deep South and Central Americans in turquoise beads. No more angry townhalls, no pesky people who‚Äôve read the Bill of Rights so much as once or twice.Most normies are still home, streaming Netflix or watching the game and grilling. And if they were to get off their duffs and protest, a Ray Epps would be thrown into the mix somewhere and they‚Äôd either be doing five years or pushing up daisies with Ashley Babbitt.It‚Äôs our move in a game in which every avenue has been denied us. It‚Äôs either fedposting or pointing out the obviousness of our quandary at this point.

            &gt; Regime outlets have disabled comments specifically to ensure the windows of their ‚Äúblack box‚Äù stay tinted.
The rapidity in which CNN closed their comments was darkly hilarious. Then NPR closed their comments for something along of the lines of defending democracy. NYT still has open comments for paying readers, but they paid an outside company to spam and direct the conversation with regime talking points, which is arguably even worse.
The sheer brazenness brought the ‚ÄúIf only you knew how bad things are‚Äù meme to life.

            At the end, but before the shooting started, the onerous taxes you speak of were reduced to one minor one.  Which was, even then, not out of line with the expense Britain had in protecting the colonies (IMO).
We‚Äôve always been tax averse as a populace and that aversion was played upon by those having ulterior motives.

            I agree with your point, but disagree on scale. Leaders at the state and major city level are the ‚Äúfarm teams‚Äù for the DC Major League; I don‚Äôt expect meaningful resistance from them.However, leaders at the county and municipal level are almost Dirt People themselves. I believe that is (eventually) where dominoes will begin falling when the grillers can‚Äôt grill anymore.That difference aside, excellent point about their greatest fear. I think that it is the only reason we aren‚Äôt bombing Iran. The GAE military is too small for such a conflict, volunteers are nonexistent, and a draft would simply be ignored.TickTock #aintgoing would be the end of the current Cloud People.

        ‚ÄúDirt People political culture is a debate about what in the hell is going on in the clouds.‚ÄùLet it not be overlooked Zman‚Äôs uncanny adeptness at distilling a matter to its essence. The dirt people cannot be sure what really occurs in the clouds. Unless one has access to the upper echelons of power, one can only speculate about the ways of the cloud folks, which tend toward the mysterious, inconsistent, and unpredictable.My own perhaps incorrect impression has long been that bankers run the world. Most of what financier-controlled mass media expose to the public amounts to little more than a theater of endless distractions ‚Äî so that bankers can continue running the world, essentially unopposed. There‚Äôs a reason Jesus chased the moneylenders out of the temple. Puts me in mind of that old Mayer Rothschild quote (possibly misattributed): ‚ÄúGive me control of a nation‚Äôs money supply and I care not who makes its laws.‚Äù Whoever is funding all the madness has the real power. ‚ÄúFollow the money trail‚Äù did not become a stale cliche` for nothing.Then again, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe the cloud people represent some weird, esoteric cult operating on impulses and principles that the rest of us cannot begin to comprehend. Maybe they‚Äôre a bunch of satanic child molesters. As a lifelong dirt person, I really can‚Äôt say one way or the other.

            I tend to see it as the bankers hire the Cloud people. Basically, the bankers are producers and directors of a reality show while the Cloud people are the people on the show. Granted, that actors are only vaguely aware that they‚Äôre just cast members on a reality show, but that‚Äôs what they are.The producers and directors push the show in certain directions but let the cast do their thing so long as it fits what the producers and directors want. Occasionally, the cast goes way off what the producers and directors want and they need to be put back into the place or even replaced.What we‚Äôre seeing is a reality show.

        I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that our rulers don‚Äôt know what we dirt people are thinking, but that they just don‚Äôt care.

            I agree.  And Lankford should be first in line.  As an Oklahoman, I am ashamed that we sent that ghoul to the US Senate.  I sent him a scathing email about what a scumbag he is.  I told him that I am currently a registered Independent but will register as a Republican if he is primaried so I can vote against him.The guy was a ‚Äúyouth minister‚Äù at a Baptist youth camp (Falls Creek) prior to becoming a Senator.  There were credible allegations of sexual abuse of the youths by clergy and other staff at the camp.  I‚Äôm not aware of Lankford being accused of anything, but he was high up in the administration of the camp and I believe he had to be aware of the allegations.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he was involved in covering up what happened.

        France is Catholic, Catholics supposedly have a culture of submitting with docility to authority. If you want to talk about Jews, they have rabbis instead of priests‚Äî the theology department is in charge of the religion. This is how you end up with black boxes, per the first paragraph.A couple of years ago, I was flaming Puritans somewhere, and it struck a false note. I asked myself if it was what I thought, or if I was parroting. Realized I was steeped in a critique of Protestantism (much of it quite valid tbh), which made me realize the spent force Protestantism is today.When I hear talk of revolution lately, it tends to be French, not 1776. America is (or used to be) DIY. God helps those who help themselves. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of that spirit left. Trust the Science! Vote harder! Wait for Jesus! (Or Trump lol.)  Etc.Idk.

            This ‚Äì they don‚Äôt care (and unfortunately don‚Äôt need to care) what Dirt People think.
For that reason, I tend to disagree with this take:
If Mitch McConnell wanted more power, he would never have gone along with this ridiculous bill and instead railed against the Ukraine project.
If Bitch McConnel wants more power (or keep what he has) he will do the bidding of those for whom he is a bitch.  One simple heuristic explains most political conduct (conduct, not necessarily rhetoric) ‚Äì is it good for the juice?

        These are people who have held a grudge against Russia for generations, going back to the Tsardom and the Pale of Settlement.

        I‚Äôm trying to work out where the title ‚ÄúThe Madame‚Äôs Shadow‚Äù came from. The reference to Marie Antoinette is clear. And the other part comes from, I think, the sci-fi mini-series ‚ÄúLexx‚Äù, where the emperor is ‚ÄúHis Divine Shadow.‚ÄùOn an unrelated note I‚Äôm looking forward to watching Tucker‚Äôs interview with Vladimir this evening. I imagine Team Biden is collectively voiding itself in its trousers (and skirts). Tucker is going to face a hard time if and when he returns to US shores, if he‚Äôs courageous (foolhardy?) enough to do so. Personally, if Vladimir offered me a residence permit, I‚Äôd gratefully accept it.

            My experience with male upper middle class white friends is a mixed bag, which is more than I could say a few years ago.  One friend, who is smarter than I am, supports Nikki Haley.  I don‚Äôt even know where to start with that one.Others though are seeing the hook nose peering out from behind the curtain, and are waking up to the evil of our leaders.  A group of us were discussing how much of the history we have learned is probably a lie, and one friend said Osama Bin Laden had a point.  I like to pull up the medal count from the 1936 olympics and show how, contrary to the myth that Jesse Owens humiliated Hitler, the Germans completely dominated with 101 medals versus 56 for the US.I am also starting to tell the joke about the woman who was a holocaust denier all her life, until her family did an intervention.  They brought in a rabbi to explain the history of the Jewish people and what they were doing today.  She did a complete 180 and now can‚Äôt believe it only happened once.

Not that we‚Äôve really kept in touch, but even when my husband last saw some of them in 2019 they were still secure with the status quo.  And who‚Äôs to say they were wrong on a personal level?  These were people generally considered conservative pre-Trump, and government jobs and following ‚Äòthe rules‚Äô made them all very financially comfortable.  They all had far more money than we did, and their kids each had multiple degrees . . . albeit along with multiple divorces and Zero grandchildren.Even one of my husband‚Äôs childhood friends, also government employed although in the hinterlands and not DC ‚Äì still seems to think the pattern will hold.  On the one hand, he acknowledges that everything my husband warned him about has come to pass.  On the other hand, he still has his substantial retirement  money invested in the market, and even pushed his sole child to take the clot shot so he could get a job as a minor government functionary.  It worked for him, so why not his son?  Yes, generational politics here ‚Äì he‚Äôs a boomer with massive normalcy bias.  Even though he‚Äôs smart enough to see how bad things are getting, deep-down he doesn‚Äôt believe the world has truly changed.He‚Äôs a nice enough guy, but I think he‚Äôs going to be shocked by the deluge, when things finally let loose.  So, too, will your golf  buddies.

            I agree with your post, except about the part where Meta is a fiction.  There really are simpleton Americans who live on fuckbook, and Fuckerberg really does spy on them and sell their personal data to advertisers and intelligence agencies.  Though the intelligence agency payments were created via fiat, so I guess I only half disagree.

        James Lankford.
If he were actually a man of the Book like he says he is, he‚Äôd have smelled sulfur around Schumer and then started overturning tables.
I am a wretched sinner, for sure, but at least I don‚Äôt do business with the Devil. Spankford should repent and retire to the desert, if he is who he says he is.

        ‚ÄúThey are all chanting the word chaos now‚Äù.
After I read this post, I went to Gateway Pundit,(to see who an offender was), and sure enough, the article, and the first three comments had, you guessed it, the word ‚Äúchaos‚Äù in it.
While I am distressed by the notion of a collapse, it really is the only way forward, no matter what comes after.
Pray for your kids and grandkids, and most importantly, get their heads prepared. All the food, water, protection and tribe in the world won‚Äôt help if they can‚Äôt deal with the shitshow that‚Äôs coming.

        The black box principle does not only apply stateside. I just saw a headline in a meme but the headline looked real: ‚ÄúKazakhstan passes law to surgically remove the genitals of pedophiles because chemical castration is not sufficiently severe‚Äù.The Globohomo elite have no idea how utterly revolting and sick they look to the rest of the world. Pushing gays was one thing and plenty bad. But if you wanted to make a Russian mechanic, a hardcore jihadist, a hard-nosed CCP Chinaman, a Hindu hardliner from India, a Latino macho man, a farmer from Nebraska and even a French baguette baker all agree on one thing, you could do a lot worse than promoting trans surgery in kids and ‚Äúpedo rights‚Äù.The DC circuit does not understand what kinds of ferocious defense they are poking in others. This could lead to the mother of all miscalculations. And because of the intense feeling of disgust I actually hope it does lead to something just a few rungs down from that, below the nuclear involvement
