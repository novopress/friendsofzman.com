        Looking forward to listening as always.OT ‚Äì it looks like Taki has disabled comments, with a hasty, poorly written notice from ‚Äúthe editors‚Äù:http://takimag.com/article/gag_reflex#axzz5B2Kg70CtThe reason of course, is discussion of the jews.  Not blacks, or homosexuals, or muslims, or trannies, or even white cucks, you see, but jews.There is a large group of people who believe jews actively work to suppress any and all discussion and or criticism of themselves, and are the catalysts behind many of the hate speech laws we see popping up all over the west.  I was never really one of those people, but it‚Äôs hard not to sip the kool aide when they come right out and tell you yeah, we are disabling discussion because we don‚Äôt like it when jews are criticized.   it kind of fuels the fire.

            The Taki comments section was boring, repetitive and crudely racist.  Incessant crusty-old-dude ‚Äúhumor‚Äù.  Most commenters were so caught up in their own cutesy that they wouldn‚Äôt even comment on the articles, (and almost never bothered to compliment the writer).   Just a bunch of lonely old divorcees trading inside-jokes.  The comments section made everyone look bad, and surely kept writing talent away. Not helpful.   If Taki thinks you‚Äôre a bore, then you‚Äôre probably a bore.  I‚Äôm so glad you were all shut down.  Goofy idiots.

        Mateen‚Äôs father being a FBI informant isn‚Äôt surprising when it‚Äôs known that Whitey Bulger was also a FBI informant for many years.
The uncle of the Tsarnaev bomb brothers, who brought them to America, was married to the daughter of Graham Fuller, a top CIA officer.
Mateen‚Äôs father wanted to be Afghanistan President and go to war with Pakistan, I imagine that Uncle Tsarni was involved in Chechenian separatism and was supported by the CIA. Steve Sailer is quite right in saying ‚Äòinvade the world, invite the world‚Äô, these terrorist attacks are blowbacks from the Deep State foreign policy.

                Rap can only convey the things you described. It cannot convey the complex human tragedy of Western Civilization sinking into oblivion. But classical music is complex enough to encompass this tragedy, and more. There is a sweet melancholia in this music that is somewhat akin to gazing on beautiful ruins. Our ruins are not going to be so picturesque.

                    Epaminondas-I agree completely.  There are three things that help me keep calm when I contemplate the ongoing collapse of our culture and any semblance of civilization:  reading history, listening to classical music, and reading the Bible.  All three remind me that humans have encountered devastating problems in the past, and there is grace and beauty even in the darkest times.

        This week also marks the 50th anniversary of the 3 days of rioting that rocked Lagos back in ‚Äô68.  It is hard to estimate the extent to which this singular event drove whitey to the neither reaches of the surrounding counties and sealed Lagos‚Äôs fate as corrupt 3rd world shithole.

        Z-Man ‚Äì the word you are looking to describe the cops is UNDISCIPLINED.  Part of it is training, part is their selection, some of it is total lack of consequences for shooting up a neighborhood.  Combine all that with terrible leadership and the cop unions that go to incredible lengths to cover for their most incompetent members.‚ÄúI feared for my life‚Äù is now justification for spraying bullets indiscriminately.  A few decades ago, a man who uttered such nonsense would rightly be described as a coward and considered ill-suited for police work.The average 20-year-old Infantry Marine has far more trigger discipline ‚Äì and no union sticking up for him when he decides to shoot at the wrong time.

                A few years back someone, possibly John Lott, detailed the fact that lawful citizens who carry are multiple times better than cops at actually shooting the person they intend to shoot, to have correctly identified that person for what he is, to not accidentally hit bystanders, and in many other ways to be vastly superior to cops in similar situations. Not mentioned was that they also do not create situations of deadly force where none existed.I briefly knew two marvelous cops, partners, who existed entirely outside of that culture. I asked them how they did it. They always went home to their families after work. Always. No cop shops, no drinking.

                    Probably was Lott.  Have also read interesting research that shows as the magazine capacity goes up the number of rounds expended climbs.  Unless well trained there is a tendency to do a mag dump once the shooting starts and if more than one officer is shooting it is basically ‚Äúcontagious‚Äù.   A lot of cops marksmanship sucks.  Know a guy who ran the VIP protection unit for the NYPD‚Äìhe jokes that the only two absolutely safe spots if a regular beat cop starts shooting is directly in front or directly behind.  All other points of the compass are in play.  Which is not surprising since quals consist of basically firing the three carried mags twice per year.  When I lived in Philly in a neighborhood that necessitated keeping a revolver handy at night, used to shoot at a range regularly  that had big Philly cop clientele.  most sucked.  Period.  Would outshoot them on 7 and 15 yard silhouettes ‚Äìand I was using a S&amp;W 15 D/A.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolfOne is a familiar companion animal, the other is a wild animal that has been known to attack humans.Yet, they are very VERY similar genetically. In fact, they can crossbreed and the offspring of such hybrids ARE fertile ‚Äì unlike the crossbreeds of Horses and Mules which create infertile Donkeys. It‚Äôs said the common ancestor of Wolves and Dogs is extinct, though scientists debate on whether they are even separate species. Generally though they are considered ‚ÄùSister Taxa‚Äù (separate, though related, species).I‚Äôm one of those that believe there are a ‚ÄùSister Taxa‚Äù to Homo Sapiens ‚Äì Homo Africanus. Both can stand on two legs, however one can speak quite well, the other can mimic human speech (some quite well, others, well, listen to some rap ‚Äùmusic‚Äù or visit a Baltimore public school ‚Äì if you dare).Homo Sapiens live in cities like Seattle, Homo Africanus live in things that vaguely resemble human cities like Baltimore. Though that species deserves to be returned to it‚Äôs own habitat where they can live as nature intended.

        I‚Äôve noticed scientists purposefully ignoring evolutionary facts. Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals both found mostly in Europe and western Asia had significantly larger brains than modern humans.  Something was going on there (seasons for one).https://phys.org/news/2010-03-cro-magnon-skull-brains-shrunk.html

        Yo, Zman ‚Äì about to listen to the cast, but just read this.  It takes a special kind of effort to remain blind to reality.  All those who can see are evil.
https://samharris.org/ezra-klein-editor-chief/
Precis: Sam Harris and Ezra Klein.  Harris shows us how you get Voxplained if you even talk to Charles Murray and why it is a waste of time to talk to Klein.  Read the emails.  Also amusing for the interface between a first-rate mind and one that is‚Ä¶   not quite first-rate.
Worth a mention down the road if you are so moved.

            I saw that. I‚Äôm conflicted non Harris. He seems to struggle controlling his emotions and biases, which leads him into some of the same problems that haunt Pinker‚Äôs work. Atheists always seem to have this defect. On the other hand, he talks about taboo topics on occasion.
Ezra Klein, on the other hand, is just duplicitous grifter. He‚Äôs not very smart either. He does a good job concealing, but that‚Äôs what makes him a successful grifter.

                Harris is the type of anti-religious atheist who is unnerved by the reality of the post-Christian world as it unfolds and is engaged in a desperate search to replace it with something concrete, yet everything he grasps toward that end has  religious overtones. He is not a first rate mind because his character lacks the vision which humility alone provides great men in order to first see themselves as ridiculous.

        The podcasts are getting better every week; and at their core, they are not only educational, but they speak to verboten topics not found anywhere else. It is also brain exercise, which is sorely needed in today‚Äôs climate of cognition suppression by the mass media. Now please go one step further. Help your readers understand how to use this information to make useful predictions. The human mind evolved as a prediction processor, and this is a key survival trait that needs to be employed by everyone right now.

        My apologies Z. The Howie Carr thing was a bit much üôÇAs mentioned things aren‚Äôt getting any better out there. The training has improved drastically in the past few years.My favorite was the range 2000. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúshoot, don‚Äôt shoot ‚Äù scenario with a full size screen and laser guns showing hits and misses.And you‚Äôre right it is a no-win situation. That‚Äôs why you find less and less kids trying to get on the job.In fact the last time I renewed my permit the chief said how happy is he was his kid was getting on the fire department !These new kids need our support, not less of it.P,S did enjoy the rest of the podcast as always.

You come out swinging like a conservative but then turn around and kick people in the nuts that actually support you . . . . . .like police officers !

                Z. You can‚Äôt suck and blow at the same time. Do you want to know what the difference between a Ranger, a Navy SEAL, and a cop is?Training.I‚Äôm a gun hound. I know what I‚Äôm talking about. The only way to train our cops to think their weay through a fire fight is to expose them to fire fights. Do that hard enough and often enough, and the cops you sent in to that training will come out as squaddies. Then you‚Äôll be screaming about militarized police forces. The reason the cops have those military toys is because We The People have them too. If you send Officer Friendly into a gang turf war with a 38 revolver ‚Äì he‚Äôs going to end up in a box. Have you seen the fortified crack houses these guys have to deal with? They‚Äôre popping up in upscale neighbourhoods now. Would you want to try and breach one without a bullet proof vest and an assault rifle?As we careen down the path to a progressive socialist utopia, police work is becoming more and more like a no-win situation. If the cops finally manage to arrest someone ‚Äì any number of judicial finks will be on the tax payer‚Äôs clock trying to get them back out on the street.The cops are not the problem. It‚Äôs us.

                    We the people don‚Äôt have military toys. Some have a  AR-15 but that is not a M-4 with AP ammo meant to slice through body armor and houses. We don‚Äôt have MRAP‚Äôs, armored Hummers or $10k sniper rifles or MP-5‚Äôs, flash bangs, or access to Blackhawks.The fact is most shootings are by pistol, not by rifle since those aren‚Äôt concealable. And even when the bad guys use a fully auto Ak-47 are the users are horribly incompetent and just spray lead.And the last time I checked cops have either 9mm or .40 cal Glocks. .38 special? Jesus you are out of it.Crack Houses? Here in Los Angeles county I haven‚Äôt heard about a crack house raid in over a decade. And we do have a drug problem.  The particular area where I live was once known as the meth capital of CA for a while because of all the places you could cook the stuff.We‚Äôre not the problem. It‚Äôs mostly found within the Black and Hispanic communities and their male population. If you have lots of Mexicans or Blacks in your town you have lots of crime and bad ones at that.My town prior to the advent of subsidized apartments for welfare scum and inner city types was so safe you could leave your front door unlocked at night and your car as well Kids didn‚Äôt have to chain their bicycles because no one would steal them. This was small town CA up until 1980.

                        Rod ‚Äì I KNOW the cops don‚Äôt use 38 special anymore. I guess the point I was trying to make went over your head.The object of any gunfight for a cop is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. That means if you have to shoot people, you want to take them out of play on the first or second shot. At ranges over 25m pistols become very difficult to use for rank and file cops.Let me ask you this: who is enabling the black and brown crime? If you talked like that in court you would be charged with contempt even though it‚Äôs all true ‚Äì and white judges would be happy to sentence you. Yes, WE are the problem. Welfare? Same deal. We‚Äôre paying danegeld to human trash to behave ‚Äì and we‚Äôre getting ripped off. If we don‚Äôt do something about it, it WILL get worse. When it does, you can bet cops and even guys like us will need full blown military hardware to deal with it.One of the things I hate about libertarians is that those idiots can‚Äôt tell the difference between cops and SS storm troopers. Cops now have to deal with what are essentially homegrown warlords. Anyone that denies that doesn‚Äôt understand what the cops are up against ‚Äì and what WE will be up against if this continues. California is turning into a shithole largely because the locals handed it over to the bad guys rather than firing a shot. The thin blue line broke and now as you say, they can‚Äôt leave anything out at night or it won‚Äôt be there in the morning. It serves them right too.
