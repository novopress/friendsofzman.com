        “There is no such thing as gender dysphoria.”Not true. Gender dysphoria, however much you may deplore the term, is very real. Anyone who believes he is “really,” or “deep down,” or “in some sense” actually of the opposite sex, is suffering from gender dysphoria. It’s a recognized mental illness, and it’s still in the diagnostic manuals. In other words: trannies are mentally ill, and the medical establishment knows it. They just refuse to do anything about it. Psychological “counseling” for gender dysphoria is actually nothing more than a vetting process, a series of hoops a man is made to jump through to prove he’s sick and desperate enough to believe in “reassignment.” That way he won’t be likely to sue for malpractice after it’s too late.Then, afterwards, you tell him he’s courageous and victimized, and he becomes the perfect patsy for the Cult. “Into the minefield, Wanda. We’re right behind you.” You’re right about this: it won’t end well. But by the time it ends, all the trannies will be long gone: having outlived their usefulness, they will have been among the first to be “disappeared.”

        For the left, it is not enough for us to watch the Crazy Train going down the rails. We have to get on board.

        Well said. As I wrote here on a comment, if you can force people to believe the impossible, getting them to believe the improbable is nothing.As to the peanut-allergy analogy, children’s allergy to peanuts has been shown to greatly diminish or vanish if they’re exposed to small quantities of peanuts in their diet. Keeping them away from peanuts is actually not the answer.Pointing out a man is a man is not ‘intolerance’. Beating him up or chasing him down the street *is* intolerance. However, his (and his cohort’s) insistence that you pretend he’s a woman is genuinely intolerant.I think Europe is moving to the right and America (still with a far smaller % of Muslims) is still shifting to the left, towards political correctness. In ten years in Europe there’ll be a lot less of this political correctness, though I’m not at all sure that what will replace it will be any better.America would be wise to take an example from Europe but society is anything but wise.p.s there was an article about women who are convinced they’ve been impregnated by aliens and who identify as having hybrid alien children (some of them with horns). What’s the difference between one of these women, the man who identifies as a 6 year old girl and the men who identify as women?

        The way we treat trannies these days is similar to the way we treat kids with peanut allergies.  Previously, when the world was much saner, we would’ve isolated the kid with the peanut allergy.  Now, in order to protect the one kid with the peanut allergy, we pretend that the one kids’ problem affects every child equally, and therefore ban any product containing peanuts from any area the kid with the peanut allergy may come into contact with.Same with trannies.  Instead of isolating them, and treating them humanely, our betters have decided that in order to protect trannies, we need to pretend that this a problem that effects all of us equally.As Chrstopher Lasch may have surmised, we are living under a “Tyranny of the Clever”.

        Brighton is a strange place. They embrace Green politics, are regarded as the ‘gay capital’ of the UK and essentially try to do the sort of things sane people would avoid.But, the fact that Brighton College dragged (pun intended) a cross-dressed man on to a stage might just have made a few of the kids obliged to watch and listen think that they would look just as laughable if they ever tried to be something they are not. They would quietly understand being a comic figure merely turns them into  laughing stock. Such clumsy displays are likely as not to be the sort of miscalculation the left sinks in: as they press for more propaganda the result is not persuasion but dissociation as people get to see what a hopeless joke they are, and how little they represent. I have no doubt a good many of the kids there, even in loony Brighton, would have thought “Dear God, what mess I see before me. So, I won’t be doing that…”By the way, I note the Telegraph picture of the Headmaster has the obligatory smiling black, brown and white mix behind him. Yes, Brighton loves diversity.

        Progs talk a lot about “modernity” which means massive 3rd world immigration to White countries, coloreds having preference in education and jobs, obedience towards Global crony capitalism.
