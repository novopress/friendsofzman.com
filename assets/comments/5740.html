        “Sodomite” has an obviously derogatory connotation.”Of COURSE it does! It makes reference to ONE of the last times the “experiment” failed, and what happened to the entire society that“tolerated” it!I know…I know….”Just hasn’t been done RIGHT yet”,But if you insist…. Poofter, or pillow biter it is !Disclosure: I freely discriminate between *GAY!!!* folks, and those who are simply homosexual.

        “….the scolds who are forever lecturing us never take a break. They are eternal.”“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of itsvictims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live underrobber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’scruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point besatiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment uswithout end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”C. S. Lewis.That seems to be where we have arrived. The scolds just need to be thrashed.

            Did you seriously mean “void” – like in dumping a huge load? Certainly gives your post “food” for thought…

        I have to agree that it has become epidemic.Fortunately this has no effect on me.If someone does not like the plain and often impolite language that I prefer to use then I generally encourage them to become Asexual and go fuck themselves.

        I prefer to use words the way God Almighty defines them. Sodomite and Gommorahite fit the description perfectly. Who can improve upon that?

        No, no one can afford to alienate 2% of the population, especially since they are exactly like the heteronormative except for prodigious promiscuity, gay parades, pederasty, Hollywood, and endless propagandizing. Just as it would be a game ender to take on the illegals invasion–until the moment the Donald just did it.
