        For people not on Gab, the Zman’s Gab comment on the election is also very sharp:***I must admit that even though I’ve been predicting a rigged election for months, it is still a let down to see it happening. It’s like the passing of an old friend who has been sick for a long time. You know what’s coming, but it still feels bad when it happens.America has been sick for a long time. Most here have known it. Some maybe hoped Trump was the miracle cure. Others thought they had reconciled themselves to the inevitable. Others thought Trump would buy some more time with our old friend America.Last night America died. Everyone is justified in feeling bad about it. Treat this like the loss of an old friend. Mourn now, but then use this reality to help your normie friends move past their civic nationalist nostalgia into the cold reality of now, just as you would help a friend mourn the loss of a parent.

        “Back in the days of mechanical voting machines and paper ballots, the vote was counted in hours. If the polls in a state closed at seven, the vote was known by nine.”
Yep. The only reason for this to have changed is to make fraud easier to perpetrate.

                It is…amusing that in the time since the Florida election imbroglio of 2000 that voting management and procedures that were supposedly meant to address the issues have continually made the situation worse, not better.

                    That is also intentional.
Some Leftist, one of the Naomis I think, wrote an entire book about disaster as political opportunities back in the GWB administration.

                        That is wise.Progressive thought is kind of baked into the cake since our original eschatology is linear and assumes a happy ending.Same with its toned down cousin,the  Whig theory of history.I have a more Buddhist POV  myself and assume while a person or occasionally a group of people may achieve whatever enlightenment is, groups and societies do not.History doesn’t exactly repeat or rhyme but it will play out the same themes over and over till the end of days.

                    The American system has perfected a sort of ritualistic “dance of reform”.  It works like this:
X isn’t working!
This step can then be followed by one or both of; throw more money at X! or throw whizbang technology at X!
It later turns out that the money got stolen somehow and/or the technology turned out to be a perpetual motion machine hooked to a Rube Goldberg mousetrap and a random number generator.
A few years later we start to hear… X isn’t working!  We need more….

        Welp, we wanted the system delegitimized.  Now we’re getting it, good and hard.It will mean strife and uncertainty for the rest of many of our lives, but the potential for our children to live in a society that doesn’t hate them.

            Regions which cannot run an election honestly should be expelled from the union. Who decides? A constitutional convention to add ballot security measures to the constitution. Let states who can’t abide rules GTFO.A split would require replacing the dollar anyway, which is another catastrophe soon to happen, and perhaps best done while a bit of advantage can be gained – let the blue states keep all that debt based currency while we switch to a commodity based $ and refuse to take the old $ ?   This could be done so that some very deserving entities get screwed – China, fed reserve banks, most of the “financial elite” wealthy …  the only bond holders I’d care about is the social security “lockbox”, and we’d soon be paying tax dollars into that mess anyway.

                    I agree. I’ve been saying for months that they would rig the election even if Trump turns out a big vote. They simply don’t care anymore who knows. Still, it is a let down to finally see it happening. But, we signed up knowing it was a long fight.

                            That’s the right attitude, Whitney. Brief disappointment is acceptable. A Trump victory should never have been an integral part of any of Our individual or movement planning. Simply one of a number of possibilities that need to be accounted for. Gird your loins, stay physically and mentally fit, and pivot when necessary.

                                I just saw a demographic breakdown showing blacks went 90% for Biden.  This after Trump’s letting a bunch of criminals out of jail, and endless pandering to rappers and such.  Can we please just give up on thinking blacks will ever be anything but Democratic pets?

                                    If Trump wins and it turns out that his pandering to negroes and hispanics worked, it would negate many of the reasons for voting for him. He would probably amnesty the dreamers for starters.

                                        That’s one of my worries too. If the eventual analysis of a Trump victory shows that his fawning over blacks and hispanics put him over the top, he might easily draw the conclusion that those populations are the key to success. It will become gospel for the GOP and cucks.
Conversely, any evidence that whites were less enthusiastic for him than in ’16 could mean that Trump is less committed to whites in his second term.

                                    It’s recently occurred to me that blacks don’t actually vote 90% for dems.  But instead that the dem machine that controls the vote counting in their localities uses their apathy as a blank check for fraud.

                                Kevin Macdonald has an interesting theory of Europeans ruling the World just a century ago and now looking like we cannot survive this. He thinks the Chinese would not have succumb to the propaganda of our enemies but we did.  I never know what would have happened but say the same people that took over our institutions tried this same thing in China or India? Would it have worked there??

                                    I don’t think so. China had a very outward looking position in the 1400s. They had fleets of ships that were far larger than the caravels of Spain and Portugal. They dispatched these ships to the east coast of Africa and Arabia. Theoretically, these ships could have reached to west coast of North America.Then suddenly, the entire fleet was scrapped. Maybe they got a taste of diversity and decided it was not their cup of tea.

                                            Yes, it was. Incidentally, the British stole tea plants from China to grow them in British-controlled areas like India.As far as I know, there is no agreed upon explanation why China scrapped its treasure ships. If they hadn’t, they could have easily reached North America decades before Spain.

                                                It’s worthy of note that the Chinese had also developed the fore-and-aft rig centuries ahead of the West but never became a true seafaring nation. If memory serves, they did so during the T’ang dynasty, maybe 8th century.

                                                A new Emperor took power is why. He didn’t want foreign pollution of his power, so he beheaded the eunuch captains and burned the Treasure Fleet.




And, they did reach North America. An ambassador loyal to the previous dynasty smuggled out a Zheng Ho map of Cuba, including latitude tables.




He gave it to the Pope-in-Exile, who gave it to Ferdinand of Spain, who sent out the call for explorers to find this place, answered by Columbus.

                                        China looked inward, and bought the Fleet home. China naturally throughout it’s history looks inward.They probably have little warlike urges or impulses beyond Taiwan – but again to them Taiwan is a rebel province.China always looks inward, it’s a full time job.  They are only interested in China and their bordering neighbors, mostly to protect China.

                                    It DID work there. Chinese succumbed to commie propaganda in a big way to the tune of 60 million plus dead before they righted the ship finally. So I’m going to say it can work on any population if the enemy is patient enough for the ‘long march’.The more relevant question is, can Europeans on all continents take the hard steps to cut the cancer out as the Chinese had to do before it is too late?

                                    I’m doubtful that it would work there.  The Chinese have never been told to be guilty of the holocaust … that grievance cannot be used to silence them as they see their institutions slowly but methodically overtaken by another ethnic group bent on changing the very fabric of their country … as has been done here over the past decades.

                                    We certainly can.Let me ask this semi rhetorical entirely theoretical  question.Answer if you like but feel free to not answer as OPSEC may matter.What happens if President Trump calls the militia to his aid claiming a coup?He has the legal right to do this and a Constitutional obligation to do so as well.This means outright civil war with half or so of the military  basically all the USMC  some Fed Leos plus Militia groups from bikers and truckers to actual militia vs Antifa, Deep State and some of the rest of the military and maybe some foreign mercs.Will you be ready at the proverbial minutes notice? Will you even go?And sure I know Trump isn’t our guy but what is the option? Communism, perpetual election fraud?Its something worth considering even meditating on as it might happen very soon.

                                    I like the MagaTruck rallies.In 1941 the Germans beat the Russians with inferior numbers and tanks…because they had more trucks.  They could logistically support their Panzers, the Russian tanks broke down en masse and were abandoned.  The Russian tanks the equal [BT-7] or far superior T-34s or KV-1s to the German tanks.
In 1944 the USSR had far more trucks – thanks to Detroit, and lend lease.
Having said that Alzaebo – this won’t be a ‘rally’.  But showing up for work is the first essential part of any job.

                        Like Whitney, I woke up disappointed though knowing this was rigged. Surprised myself still wishing for fluffy bunnies and unicorns.Good….now done with Wah! and back up in the saddle. “We signed up knowing it was a long fight.”And the Senate didn’t flip. Maybe it should have. Pragmatism either way.

                                I find it unfathomable that half the country would vote in a dementia sufferer and a communist social climber.
They bought it, they own it.  They will choke on it.  Nature and fate do not look kindly upon such things.
The madness will now go up a notch or six.  As Ol’ Remus used to say, “stay away from crowds”.

                                            Dutch pondered how half his countrymen could vote for an alzheimer patient and a harlot. Easy: we aren’t a country in any meaningful way other than under force monopoly. And the polyglot hordes are not his countrymen. No need for surprise or shock.Schlicter, Braken, and Pournelle are all good primers for what is to come. Study, rinse and repeat.Deus Vult. I read that phrase when I was a kid and fascinated with knights. God’s Will. Crusader battle cry, yes, but more powerful when whispered to remind oneself to listen, obey, endure, and trust in triumph. I am a little saddened that phrase has become solely associated with a single internet personality. They are words of power and transcendent.Ol Remus’ wisdom is and will be missed going forward. I am glad his suffering is over.

Paying off debt is great advice. Add refusing to cooperate with any but positive elements in your local government is a must.
Raise awareness, support, and comradery with your fellow Whites without sounding bitter. Recruit by example.

                                        Thank you for your reply. We don’t need a shooting war we need a spending war. Yea it is called “maff” and I know it is all about white privilege, but it is real. Stop supporting people that want to see you broke or dead or both.

                                                    There are plenty of younger  Whites and given this isn’t a race war anyway all kinds of Off Whites and others who are much like us. Numbers are not an issue.And its not hard to get skinny and fit to fight especially when we have a hardcore pile of trained soldiers.What we lack is a message of hope that isn’t tied to economics.Nothing that ails us is precisely about money, a smaller but stable economy would work better than a bigger bolder less stable one.Stability sure but we mostly have what we need and want.What ails us is lack of hope and purpose. What I never heard the President say is “I want to make an America where its good to have a family and you can raise healthy happy kids.”And yes I know MAGA encompass that , its not enough.We need solace and as much as he tried, President Trump being a businessman assumes that will come with a better economy.It won’t.Its our job though to build that Hallmark Chanel world, where men and women can find one another, get married, stay together and raise kids 2 maybe even 3 in a healthy moral environment.We have to take on  all the people who are in the way of that, the tech over people maniacs, economic migrants , money men andvested interests who want us chasing the all mighty dollar above all else.  the degenerates ,worse . They need to be gone from power,That will not be easy and it will require a ‘willing to push the button before we lose” mentality otherwise we end up done in by bakers.Worse the rewards will seem meager but done right? Long term? That is America Reborn.After that? Maybe we can go the Space, build an Authoritarian Right underwater city  (we know how the Libertarian one comes out, not good) who knows.

                        They don’t care who knows, because they are on the brink of total control. If they win this one election then they can just sweep everything under the rug later.
I’m surprised at their boldness, all they had to do was stall Trump and wait until 2024.
The question is, will anyone do anything. Even normie right seems awake, they’re posting graphs of fraud and stuff. But that isn’t nearly enough.

                    Most normies will do exactly that, but a sizable minority will have had their faith in “America” shaken, maybe to the core.
We don’t need 100% of normies. If 10% or 20% start to wake up, we’re well on our way.

                        It’s also important to note that many of the people we think are Magatards actually have a much more sophisticated and nuanced (and radical) view of things than you might suspect.  I know this because I’m one.  Take a look at my facebook page for instance,http://haha.justkidding.org/. Well, no of course I’m not linking that here but if I did you would see another delusional Magatard.  It’s all fake though, a role I play on the intertubes.  It’s enough to get the right people sending friend requests and I know some of them are the same.

                            I think you are very right, but that’s just my intuition based on my own projections. I don’t really know any Magatards in real life but i like the hell out of them and I do possess a cap that I never wear, and flew a flag on my truck the last couple days to show solidarity to my imaginary orange man good brothers in arms. I’ve been meaning to go to a rally but keep missing them, but the Magatards are the only everyday people in present society i can look on with tender empathy and warm regard. They are like our children. The ‘Birds and the Bees’ talk is drawing fast at hand though.

                        Faith in our government is shaken to the core … from elation last night to mourning this morning … now to anger (the stages, I guess).How do you mobilize against ALL of the media, a corrupt DOJ &amp; FBI … not to mention other Intelligence agencies?  Make any real noise and they might just take you away … hate speech charges.  I guess that we’re in the period of Martyrs … that’s how it starts, I suppose.

                    I agree.This is a war by the elites against us deplorable whites. Upper middle class whites are too comfortable to come to the defense of their own people.As an example, when I first met a former co-worker in 1996 he was a Pat Buchanan supporter. He was fresh out of law school.  We only worked together about 2 years, but remained in contact up until about 9 months ago when I mentioned my politics are now dissident right.He is now a bigwig at a large Oklahoma City law firm.  After I mentioned my current political leanings, he longer responds to my texts. I guess he is afraid being associated with me will compromise his very comfortable lifestyle.

                        He thinks you’re an informant. Did you bond over life-changing events. No? The partners beneath him time-wise would probably hire an informant to remove him from their path. I hated BigLaw for this reason — every day it was justified paranoia for me, senior partners pitting us against one another often for sport but always for reduced fee slave work. My wife can do it, I never could.

                Exactly. It’s openness of the rigging that’s important. Joe Normie needs a big slap in the face, and he’s getting it now.
Trump is going to lose. Half the country will not accept the results, though, unlike the Left, they won’t riot. But they will have lost faith in elections, and what is America if not a democracy.
Trump really has turned out to be a historic figure. His failure to be re-elected may very well be a turning point in this country.

                    They couldn’t wait just 4 more years.  Trump is the last white male President, and very likely the last “R” president before US becomes like Mexico’s PRI party that held total power for 70+ years.
This out and out rigging of the election isn’t primarily for Joe six pack voter.
No, this is a very public message to those who work in government that this is your last chance to pay homage to the uniparty.

                                If they are really using the elections to line their pockets through the stock market, then sowing confusion to get prices to drop (so they can buy low) then letting Trump win in the end a month form now to rally the market (so they can sell high) would make most sense.But I saw that markets actually rose. So it does not make sense.

                                    They play the options market, that’s why there’s little obvious “insider trading” stock trading.





They buy and sell puts, profiting most on the downward. Their calls and hidden ‘private investor group’ buys are at the bottom, profiting from steep discount.




Plus, Cayman Island and special nephew cutouts. Joe’s brother Jim actually took possession of the moola, so Joe stayed ‘clean’.


“sowing confusion to get prices to drop (so they can buy low)”- good catch. The rise was them covering their short positions and cashing out.  The other side of the trade was waiting and made their bones too, win-win.

                        Trump’s only hope is to hold onto PA, NC and Georgia, and then to somehow win Nevada. Winning Nevada would prevent Cadaver Joe from reaching 270 votes. What happens then, I have no idea. But I’m pretty sure Trump will engage in lawfare to overturn the results. And if that doesn’t work, he may urge those who voted for him to create havoc. I, for one, am ready, willing and able.

                        I think President Trump may pull a win at the last moment but if not it will be litigated. He is if nothing else a fighter.Given war is inevitable anyway maybe its the best thing for all of us.After the horror and chaos are over we can let the nation collapse into homogeneous polities.You see even if we had the demography of 1960, the US would still be  too diverse to exist without an overwhelming reason to do so and we don’t have that.

                            A great many Feds are Deep State and could not be trusted with such a task.There are no easy ways out even a Trump win at the supreme Court will result in riots.Ultimately this will drag on and on for an interminable amount of time till someone concedes.Bush v Gore with extra risk and tension.There is as I noted a reasonable possiblity of civil war as well and of a Canadian invasion as Trudeau claims he’ll step in if Trump won’t step down.I’m OK with that. We could use the land and frankly its stupid to have all those resources unused and in foreign hands.The only downside is that we probably just pushed the word right into a real life Fallout franchise oh well.

                                    Its mostly the weed talking I doubt anything will come of it.Now the Canadian army is pretty good but I doubt they’d be a major threat and they probably wouldn’t obey such a stupid order.Canadian conscripts would fare very poorly.And yes it would probably end up with annexation and at best everything Trudeau owned pounded into rubble if the man wasn’t executed by the military.Also there are a lot of well armed Canadians he wants to disarm who might be willing to help us out. We might not have to directly annex them at all and we can just put in our friendlies. help the nationalists with any needed deportation and be done with it.

                            I’m not sure the feds can do much. Pretty sure the states are in control of the elections. Bush v. Gore being the one big exception I can think of.That said, they’re openly stealing it. I saw a a graph of votes from WI or MI where the line went straight up for Biden early in the morning.  Someone pointed out they stopped counting to figure out how many ballots they needed.On the bright side on the way out the door I overheard 2 women from the office getting really upset over votes appearing out of nowhere. I had no clue they were at all political before this. Plus friends and all blowing up my phone over the steal. People know what’s happening. Frankly most of the defeatism I’m hearing is from people who follow politics.So yes, they’re stealing openly, no doubt aware that the public is on to it. They are daring us to stop them. Like criminals who’ve gotten away with everything and start getting sloppy. It’s a plea for punishment. At least that’s how it looks to me.

                    Simply throwing up 140k votes at midnight for Biden in Michigan and 100k more in Wisconsin, to “close up the gaps”, that was pretty cheeky.  It’s as if they are daring anyone to do something about it.
Actually, they get a twofer.  They flip things their way, and they destroy yet another western institution, the ballot box.
Reality bites, Brothers and Sisters.  At least we, around here, are more likely to see it and take it for what it is, compared to most.  The future will be different from the past, that’s for sure…

                        Let’s be hopeful.  The supremes will invalidate the 140k and 100k fraud votes and give Wisconsin and Michigan to Trump along with Penn and Arizona.  They can do it if motivated by fair play instead of garden parties in DC.

                            Wouldn’t bet on it.  That sort of exercise of raw power against the ultimately ascendant power of team D would be punished severely.
Court packing? Untraceable 3 letter agencies leaking things about justices and their loved ones?  Even impeachment of sitting judges?
The Supreme Court only makes dramatic decisions in one direction.  Cthulhu only swims left.

                                You had better hope that isn’t true because your options are war to the knife and hilt or slavery.Its not that people on our side can’t be brave, they can they simply don’t want to since none of them  see a light at the end of the tunnel if we win.I do understand this. The  consequences are horrific, essentially an end to modernity itself m decades of war , ethnic and political cleansing and impoverishment  for what it essentially economic nationalism , deportation and marriage reform.We have to have some sense of heart or baring that a lust for power.We aren’t Reds and I sure as hell ain’t Stalin but sometimes I really think we need ideological Commissars.Start babbling about how it was a 75 or a hundred years ago or nonsense policies unfit for 2020, stop looking forward to stare back at past and ZAP! Cattle prod to the nuts. Current Year please,Whine about the economic costs,  ZAP! goes the cattle prod.Start fear mongering about misuse of power or black pilling and BZZT! goes the Las Pistol40K jokes aside if you don’t want power or worse you aren’t willing to use it, you are so useless you might as well be on the other side.If things go that bad, terrible things will be done and niceties like trials and bans on collective punishment, ex  post facto ,bills of attainder  free speech and all that will be gone. Best you decide the rulesThe test of character will not be avoiding that but when you take power  knowing when the subversion stops long enough to unwind it.

                    And that is where the problem lies. If the half of the population that voted for Trump just goes away, it will be four years of amnesty, opening of the borders, crushing of the fund raising apparatus of any potential opponent through the alphabet soup agencies. In short, there will be no way to surmount any political opposition to our enemies. But wait, there’s more! Guess who’s putting together an exploratory committee for 2024? Yes, that’s right! It’s that doofy-looking, worthless cuck Jeb!

                    Trump already surpassed his 2016 vote totals in PA. Biden would need 2008 Obama levels of turnout to beat him now. This obviously didn’t happen.
The election will be stolen, and I’d say it’s only 50/50 that the court sides with trump anyways. The question is: what will we or anybody else do about it?

                        First,usual disclaimer about not doing  stupid illegal things.To answer your question, that is up to you. Not me, not the other guy, You and you alone.Waiting on other people to decide to act  means you just  wait . Nothing more.The most important thing you can do, right now, quite legal and undetectable is to change your mindset from a Conservative preserve the USA type to a power hungry, outright nasty piece of work.if you can’t do that than well go in peace. Wear your mask, get your shots and live your life. Its not brave but its your life and choice to make. In all honesty I won’t fault you , none of us should.Become reality based, only power matters right now  and decide what you want and what you’ll be willing to pay for it.After you are there, than you can make the hard choices, But hurry time is limited and the window may close for any number of reasons.At that point, Team Lucifer gets to make the calls for you.

At that point, the “guys” started the plan to keep it from happening again.America has been conquered, or is in the process of being conquered, by the 5th Column inside our ranks.They don’t care if real democracy crumbles .. they can maintain some veneer of democracy, but they will be telling us what you can do and what we can say.Poland or Hungary is sounding better all of the time.

                But weren’t the conditions/terms of the delayed counting stipulated beforehand? Trump was right to be skeptical but regrettably he agreed to it. Too bad he did not try to stop it and demand that the votes all be counted at the same night. This should have gone to the supreme court. and it is possible the court would have ruled that all the ballots must be counted at once.

                    I think that’s what Trump was getting at last night with his remarks about needing to stop the voting (not counting).  We’ll see quite soon if his legal team is going to get this thing moved to the SC quickly.

                “Normal patriotic white people need to come away from this thinking the election was stolen and the ruling class is beyond reform…”—————————————-To what end, though? Not trying to be a dink here, but… I come from a family of shitlibs. These fucks don’t back down. Please forgive my language but – there is nowhere to compromise with them. Their feelings are their reality, and fairness and honesty are net liabilities.I suppose the next step is “an eye for an eye” until that gets boring – then all out warfare. I’d really like to skip the intermediaries and go right to that last option. It would save time and lives.

                    Have hope. Other events will come to pass and affect reality. The grand solar minimum advances. This last year brought big rain and a number of midwest states were late or didn’t get the corn crop in. When the great weather changes, people get up and move into other peoples’ living room. The globalists already had their coup and the great reset is rolling out. Get your vaccine or get your bank account frozen. Don’t count on food and sundries to always be in abundance. Food is used as a Commie weapon.Other factors will play out and push, i.e. the Hayward Fault is locked and loaded and she plays nasty. So is the Wasatch Fault. So are the thrust faults in the LA Basin and the surrounding San Andreas to the east. The unexpected can be the feather that triggers the angle of repose.

                        Aren’t you forgetting the Cascadia subduction fault? That’s my favorite. Maybe it’s just because of my hatred of Portlanders and knowledge that many of the dumb hipsters moved into old unreinforced brick buildings.  They prefer those because they’re “quaint” or “ironic” or some such shit.

                    Normies need to understand that the election was stolen and the polls rigged—in order to keep them from using the excuse, “we’ll get them in the next election”.Indeed, such was the discussion here on the airwaves with one of the major local radio hosts and the former chairman of the Republican Party in AZ.  Most all discussion was how to “rebuild” the party and find and mentor new candidates for office.  Same thing we hear every election cycle.  Wash, rinse, repeat—ad  nauseam.In short, a non-recognition of the inability to repair a broken system using said same broken system—as well as a failure to recognized the demographic changes which caused the present failure.They (Normie) must understand that if their vote could change anything, they’d not be allowed to vote.  Once that settles in, they can be steered into more productive pursuit of political change.

            No, it will be over sooner than you think. Fox has just called Michigan for Biden. It’s all but over now. Trump lost. The democrats will control the House while the GOP will be lucky to retain the barest of majorities in the Senate. It’s been a total disaster for the right. Sure, Biden didn’t win in a landslide, but that doesn’t matter in this system. They’ll control basically everything now, so you can expect things to get worse — censorship, FBI abuse, terrible economic policies, media harassment.What we’ve learned from this election:The Blackpillers were right the whole time. YOU were wrong. We tried to tell you the truth, but you shot us down every time. We tried warning you about Trump sucking up to demographics that will never vote for him. You replied with nonsense about Blackxit and Candace Owens Tweets. Lol. Sure. We tried warning you that Trump’s win was a fluke and he’d better get busy expanding his base. Instead, he shrunk it with unpopular tax cuts for the rich and awful behavior on Twitter.There was never going to be a Trumpslide, just as the Blackpillers tried telling you the whole time. Only a deluded simpleton ever really thought that was a reality. Anyone who pushed the Trumpslide narrative should be discarded from your list of daily reads. Anyone who seriously thought Trump would get more than 50% of the popular vote should, too. Same with all those morons who use “economic” models as a guide to elections; all elections are racial headcounts now, so that stuff no longer matters.Qanon is a hoax.That’s obvious now. Anyone who fell for that is a total moron or grifter.There was never a plan.You were scammed by an incompetent conman who just lost a winnable election through sucking up to black rappers and claiming that Biden was the real racist for signing the 94 crime bill. Turns out, White guys aren’t much into “criminal justice reform” and “lil pump.”Trump never built his wall. Anyone who says otherwise is deluded. Most of what was built was just refurbished sections of old wall. Regardless, it will never be built now — ever. And you’ll get mass amnesty on top of that. Lol.Trump abandoned populism within 48 hours of taking office and spent most of his administration denouncing you while giving away the bank to Israel. He didn’t bother protecting his followers as they were censored. The moron’s closest advisor was Jared Kushner, a corrupt NYC POS and the farthest thing from a populist that you can imagine.Fundamentally, the right is just too stupid to win; no talent, no organizing ability, too little in-group loyalty, easily misled. They are akin to powerless peasants trying to rise up, but historically peasants get brutally put down almost every time. This was no exception.

                Blackpillers are one of the parties responsible for this, in some ways one of the most culpable.  Normies may not realize there is a war on, shitlibs are actually fighting in it, blackpillers KNOW there’s an existential struggle going on…and their response is not just to run away but to STAY on the front running here and there trying to convince OTHERS to desert WITH THEM.Civilized armies would deal with this as a mutiny and it merited an even harsher reprisal than garden variety desertion (which was subject to summary execution).So slink away and stop congratulating yourself on being counterproductive

                    What you call ‘blackpillers’ I call ‘people who do not comfort themselves with childish delusions’.People like you are all the same–you cannot separate pointing out the dangers and follies of unworkable quasi-religious political fairy tales from actively trying to subvert the glorious Sky Castles you build in your own heads.The Right lost this election because it refused to accept the reality of the situation that DJT’s actions revealed. Like women and children, you now blame daddy because he kept telling you that Santa Claus isn’t real.Keep attacking the people who pointed out that if it waddles, quacks, and swims like a duck, the goddamn thing must be a duck and certainly will not turn out to be the unicorn you insist it must be, As this OP said, Trump’s lies about Populism were glaringly obvious within the first 48 hours–to anyone mature enough to be honest with themselves about what his appointments signified. Keep blaming the honest guys who called it the way it obviously was, though! Cuz THAT’LL help.

        Is this going to be the moment where white people finally stand up for themselves? It’s now or never. If Democrats succeed in stealing the election, their first steps are going to make sure it can’t be done to them. So lots of executive orders to grant all but amnesty, “anti-voter suppression” measures that make voting a joke, and harsh internet crackdowns to make sure nobody can question it.If the Democrats succeed in stealing the election and boomercons just mutter, grumble, and go back to consooming and grilling, America isn’t worth saving at this point and we’re going to have to figure out where to go from here.It’s now or never.

            “Is this going to be the moment where white people finally stand up for themselves?”The answer is most likely no, that’s why it is/was important for trump to win.I don’t think white nationalists realize how docile most white people have become.

The people you are talking about are the ones with things to lose.
The diverse, the people in charge, what they have to lose they do not have to risk.

                        Yes, they have things to lose in ‘the battle’. Material comfort, ‘stuff’, social standing, etc.What they don’t realize is, they are also losing thewar, by avoiding the battle. So all those things they think they are ‘keeping’ they are going to lose anyway as they are stripped of all rights &amp; disenfranchised.This is not the first time in history this has happened BTW. Attempting to ‘sit it out’ because you fear losing all your ‘stuff’ has a lot of historical precedent and it always ends the same. You lose it anyways. But your average person has zero historical memory, so the rhyming of the historic cycle continues apace…

                            I’m not going to disagree with any of that.But the idea that so many are “sheep“ strikes me as… Well, childish. As in, big words from the basement.The people we are talking about have children and houses and employers.they are not district attorneys who can ramp up the anarchic-tyranny at will. They are not “journalists,“ people with the morals of child molesters, who can say and do anything they damn please anytime they want. They are not brainless college students, who carry-on as though they will be forever insulated from their own stupidity.The people who threaten them pay no price for abusing their power, pay no price for attacking them physically, for doxxing them, for malicious prosecution, or anything else you can think of that threatens them.They did what they were supposed to do, e.g., go to work, raise their children, stay out of trouble, and vote.If that proves not to be enough, they will not sacrifice their children and what remains of their future. They will simply curl inward and take up defensive positions.

                                    This is a rhetorical non advocational , question so please do not answer it.Its cheap and easy to complain about others not doing stuff  but If this goes wrong, will YOU hunt?If you won’t, stop whining when others won’t.As for me? I can answer it. I’m not in a position where I need to do illegal things and still have free speech to a solid degree.My role for now is to remind you slugs to build a G-Damned ideology before even thinking about doing stupid /illegal things.Have  you ducks in a row, your friends close, ideas in order and a heart like frozen iron.Guns are great and useful but they are useless without skills. a plan and a goal and maybe friends.Defense might be the tactic right now but until you start thinking about offense and what kind of society you’ll build you’ll keep losing and deserve it.

So all those things they think they are ‘keeping’ they are going to lose anyway as they are stripped of all rights &amp; disenfranchised.”The cost benefit analysis is really simple. If you fight now, you lose your stuff now. If you don’t fight now, there’s a slight chance to keep it. Obviously it’s better to not fight now.Alternatively, if fighting is inevitable and you lose your stuff once the fight begins, the choice becomes, do you want to stop enjoying what you have now, or do you want to enjoy it for a little while longer? Complicating things, are you ready to fight now, or do you need time to prepare?Normies aren’t irrational, they’re mostly unprepared, and see little reason to stop enjoying good stuff before it’s absolutely necessary. Remember: just because a fight is inevitable doesn’t mean timing doesn’t matter.

                The awakening won’t occur until real pain becomes a reality as opposed to anxious anticipation. Yes, we have become soft as a result of a half-century of affluence, but that can change fast when the ancient animal within is triggered. There are habits buried in our DNA that can, and will, re-emerge.

                    I hope the best for you personally, but america is gone, every single american institution belongs to the enemy, the young gens are mostly non-white, a good portion of the white youth is trash.Historically when this has happened the native population would move and settle someplace else, I said this on a previous article, but white people are not tied to dirt, find a latino country and move there, become a nomad like the israelites.

                        I think this logic is inevitable but even out here on the DR where we traffic in unpleasant truth… most people can’t bring themselves to accept it. Yet.


People will gnash their teeth, but it will be easier the sooner they come around. At some point it will simply be too late.

                        I live in South America, am bilingual, well-travelled and will presume to tell anyone who cares to hear that there is no such thing as a “latino”. The MesoAmericans who are usually thought of as “latinos” have less in common with, say, Argentines than, say, a Gujarati with a Madrasi. A common language is not enough to define a very diverse group of folks sharing large bodies of land.I did as you suggested 22 years ago and am now very much tied to my own three acres of dirt however.A caveat: moving south  of the Río Grande, no matter how far, is not easy unless one speaks the language of the host country.

                            If you can stand YouTube , there are plenty of Fallout New Vegas clips of the Legate who is a scary scary dude.And generally the assassin patrols were great , once you get to a decent level, they becomes as a buddy of mine out it “free equipment delivery guys”Glass the patrol walk or fast travel to the nearest vendor (there are two close typically) dump the loot, buy more ammo and up a lot of ammo and caps.At low levels though? Them and the NCR patrols are nasty.Anyway off FNV , the Legate is unyielding, determined and within his cruel ideology honest. Most importantly, feared. That is a good things to aspire too.Minus the whole “monster” part anyway.

                Is it docility or that the sane Whites understand we are the only ones keeping this severely listing country afloat. The only ones who can keep good water flowing into your home and bad water treated to prevent actual plagues. The only ones who can grow enough food and manage the complicated distribution systems to keep the nation well fed. The only ones who can safely design and build bridges and other infrastructure.  We understand that if we get up to half the antics of the left we get dumped into camps or outright shot where we stand all that goes with us.How are there even enough traitorous, corrupt, imbecilic Whites voting for a senile old man with one foot in the grave and a vicious commie whore to make it close enough to steal? How do they not understand our contribution to making and keeping everything they take for granted possible?it’s not fun living around zombies. I’ve made my arrangements to remove myself from these ungrateful parasite brains and live among people who will fight to the end. Hope everyone here has the time and resources to do the same. It’s Galt’s Gulch time for all good Whites.

Great story on the forever eyerolling space alien differences between men and women. And a woman’s need for curtains. And order from chaos.Now women hate curtains and create chaos.

            “Is this going to be the moment where white people finally stand up for themselves?”
You’re making a (common) mistake in thinking that “white people” are a single unified entity.
Young whites of both genders are the product of the public schools communist education/propaganda machine and are therefore stupid beyond belief. Frankly, private schools are only negligibly better at this point.
White women are still women, and thus completely unreliable.
Boomers, are, well, Boomers…
I would guess neo-cucks make up somewhere around a third  or more of middle-aged white men.

            It’s hard not to think that, but “the insouciant American people,” as Paul Craig Roberts calls them/us, are ALWAYS the last to know ANYTHING.

        This is completely the result I expected. From a dissident perspective, it is the best result possible. Even the thickest, fattest, burger-grilling BoomerCon is watching his vote being stolen. It is very important to delegitimize the United States’ existing government before it can be dismantled or, if it is even possible, reformed. We are about to have tens of millions of NormieCons radicalized to an extent unprecedented in American history. I cannot emphasize what a good thing this is. My guess about the best-selling gift this Christmas? DVD sets of the televised reporting last night and the events about to take place. Give them to someone you love.

            Might’ve shifted the Overton Window some, but that’s about it. Your millions of radicalized Americans will stay in such a state so long until the next excuse to hunch over their smart phone avails itself. So about five minutes, tops.

                Disagree. There are millions radicalized now. How they react will depend on the degree of oppression. My guess is “Biden” backs off a bit because of the rage, and makes symbolic arrests of “white supremacists.” Still, an economic downturn or loss in war, both likely, and the country comes apart at the seams. Dissidents are in a far better position today than yesterday.
The United States is a dead empire walking now.

            Yes, but they need guidance in how to properly focus their rage and motivation. Do not join a militia, there will always be a Fed turd in the punch bowl. Don’t make it easy for them to target you. The elites want the coming battles to be pleb-on-pleb, patriots vs LEOs; a decimation among the peons. Focus/Focus/Focus. The real disease is actually few in number and a very manageable problem. And technology is your friend and a great equalizer.

                Fully agree. People need to be smart. Violence is something to be studiously avoided. The State has delegitimized itself. Help that along and make it continue to do so. You are right. Their bench is shallow and they are a manageable problem.My guess is the Deep State conducts a false flag terrorist attack in a Red area and blames Muslims, or, more likely, a false flag terrorist attack in a Blue area and blame “white supremacists.” Everyone will know the terror emanated from D.C., regardless of which approach they take.We now have a D.C. government and a local government dichotomy, and not in a federal sense. Be as loyal as circumstances allow to your local government, and if that is not possible, move to where it is possible. The D.C. government is your enemy and will leap at any excuse to oppress you, or manufacture an excuse. Keep that squarely in mind.

                Yes. Learn from Afghanistan as to how to bleed an empire dry. There’s no need for organized resistance. In fact, disorganized resistance is more effective at taking the federal government down. I’d recommend looking up how to make caltrops and molotov cocktails. Look for ways to reduce your taxable income and taxable economic activity. Sell all federal bonds. Move away from urban population centers, and make sure that you have a wood burning stove. Sand is better than thermite when it comes to ruining the gears of the federal government, especially if everyone does autonomously.

        The wicked elites are about to set cities aflame by their reckless actions. It is inconceivable that Trump or Biden will graciously concede. We now know where this is headed. Eventually, the Supremes will decide in Trump’s favor. That’s when the dry brush of political corruption will explode. I am so happy I abandoned big urban areas 20 years ago.

            I’ve spent way too much reading and learning about all this shit over the last few months so I’m going to go contrary to all the blackpilling here a bit.  I actually don’t think Biden will get away with it in the end.  Trump’s people have known they would try this.  Trump probably had that “I know we won” speech prepared because he knew Creepy Joe would be giving a speech to set up the narrative of “count every vote – including the fake ones”.  Trump is a bull-headed egomaniac who will not calmly allow himself to be bested by a zombie and a whore.Over the next weeks and months the recounts and court challenges will be fought out and by January Trump will be grudgingly declared the winner.  That’s when the fun starts.  Invest in fire suppression equipment companies.

                    True, but my point is that the presidency itself has been destroyed by this process, and whoever holds the position will be tied in knots by all the factions that refuse to acknowledge, coordinate, or comply with the mandates and directives of the President, no matter who fills the seat.  This is part of the Color Revolution playbook, which has just been achieved, no matter how things play out from here.

        Just remember, almost half the country voted for a candidate that was endorsed by the American Communist Party, wants to give free stuff and citizenship to those who are not here legally, wants to destroy the petroleum/petrochemical industry, raise taxes on gasoline/diesel, raise federal and business income taxes, impose more destructive regulations. And this is the short list.
What is sad the number who allegedly have a university education voting for these policies, so it’s hard for me to think of these people as folks I want to be around on a daily basis.

        Some in my family were mildly surprised at my lack of focus on “election night.” Despite me telling them all along there would be no “winner” on 3 November 2020.I did not consume one minute of TV. Why expose myself willingly to insurance scam ads, new pharma “medicines” I never heard of and the like. Plus, I already own a lot of pillows.The Democrats have been honing their art of stealing elections for generations. The biographer Robert Caro is on record, video record, as anti-Trump. In a wimpy, nerdy way, but a position nonetheless. However, he is also the author of the multi-volume biography of Lydnon Johnson. These books are practically a set of instructions on how to steal elections via LBJ, a truly corrupt human being, and his handlers.Especially of note in the Caro work is how Johnson was propped up but those behind the scenes. At one point, the lowly school teacher in rural Texas, Johnson, ‘needed money’ to not be ‘poor’ around powerful people. Poof, his handlers got him wealth.It’s all in the Caro LBJ books, I have read them all, they are a slog at times. But they tell you not only what you need to know, but notably nerdy biographer Caro never seems to condemn this behavior — yet he cannot seem to abide by Trump’s “new yorkness”, you know, mean tweets.

            You can be certain every mid to high level cretin in government has read “The Power Broker” (by R. Caro) about Robert Moses.   It’s like their bible.  Robert who?
Robert Moses was/is a god to central planners.  He basically built modern New York, and was never once elected to office.  Fascinating story, but just like Caro’s LBJ books, it gets into the essence of what TRUE power is when wielded by our men with no chests overlords.

                Ah, yes, the Moses book. I own and read that one too but stayed on the topic of stealing elections. The State Park named after old Robert is a notorious homosexual haunt, BTW. Look it up. Proof that God has a sense of humor? New York baseball fans surely don’t have fond memories of Moses.And the point that geeky biographer Caro seems so put off by Donald Trump’s brash style, but never seemed put out by the bureaucrat/dictator Moses any more than the thought of LBJ’s breath as he cornered politicians as he “button holed” one of them… or the countless women he (blank) holed. Imagine giving it up to that ugly, jug-eared thing on both counts.

I had forgotten, but in days lately innocuously asking those in my life what was wrong with Trump, what had he done that was so horrific, it basically boiled down to mean tweets.  It always amazes me how soft people are. But then again it took me sometime to bust out of that mold as well, being raised in the same middle class enclave, although I was never as far gone as these folks.

Looking back, I owe a massive debt of gratitude to every man I worked for, from a young age not to go all ok boomhauer and attract trolls BUT … to every one of them that busted my ass. For leaving grease in the ‘a’ of a Craftsman wrench. Fucking something up on a job site when the boss came by.It no longer amazes me how many of the ‘men’ I come across that basically process along the emotional lines of a teenage girl. Affluent men, ‘successful’ yet total cunt nerd city.Yet these weaklings are watching their country be stolen right before their eyes by more devious people of their own ilk.Ask a ‘man’ why he hates Trump and he’ll screw up his widdle face and spit out something womanly.

            I think the fracking ban was a sop to the left. The permanent US foreign policy establishment is depending on natural gas exports to wean countries away from energy dependence on Russia and to kill Russian export earnings. Reagan used a similar technique in the 1980s with oil exports from the friendly Gulf states (to the point where Gulf overproduction caused a depression in the US oil industry). Plus, renewables don’t work without natural gas.The other factor is that most of the fracking companies were unprofitable and relied heavily on easy credit from the financial sector (ie. the fed).There will be some “restrictions” on fracking that political bribes can easily get around.

Well, if the US grid is unstable and the electricity is too expensive we simply must move all our remaining production to a stable grid with cheap electricity….

There are at least a million original thinking white creatives that fell through the cracks of our materialistic capitalist society, losers in other words, that could easily invent our way into a new technological reality that isn’t a net detriment to the white tribe, that simply need resources and support, to reinvigorate American capitalism towards non myopic technologies. By not shitting on our warrior class, we will reinforce our creative hegemony and punish intellectual property theft. Dissident philanthropists need to create IQ based schools to harvest these dormant white losers.

        The big news is the collapse in Trump support among white men: Trump enjoyed a 31 point advantage in 2016, but this fell to only 18 points in 2020 and may keep falling as the battleground states wrap up counting.Trump did better than 2016 with every other demographic except white men. And honestly, bravo to white men for not blindly throwing their support to someone who never reciprocated.Despite the voter fraud—for which Trump had plenty of time to prepare since seeing it unfold in the 2018 midterms—this is all on Trump. His dithering on the riots kept Minnesota blue and turned Wisconsin blue. However “real” the Covid threat was, his inability to push out more stimulus lost him the support of white men (who have been disproportionately affected by unemployment; black nurses are still twerking on Tiktok). Trump was handed every possible advantage and warning to boost white male support beyond the margins possible for voter fraud, and he blew it.The good news is that our movement is no longer tied to the future of Trump and we should prepare for an influx of disaffected white men.

                Maybe they didn’t want to see one more rapper going into the White House.  It goes on and on.  Whether Trump wins or loses he was taking advantage of the good faith of white guys just as the DNC puts blacks in its pockets.  Only white guys take notice.

                The riots were in heavily democrat urban shitholes. I doubt there were many white men who were realistically potential Trump voters there. I think the Trump pandering to non-whites was blatant enough to  discourage white men from voting for him. Did Biden’s percentage of white men increase?

            It will be interesting to see if Trump takes this to the courts. I have a feeling his twitter bluster is just that, and he will go more or less quietly by the end of the week.And there will be no right-wing rioting—there never has been; even Charlottesville was completely the fault of the left. There might be a few halfhearted rallies by hardcore Trump supporters, but for the most part the right will accept it quietly after a few days of moaning on social media.Thenwe’ll find out if the Harris era will be anti-White accelerationism, or if it’ll be a slackening off if anti-Whites retreat into Netflix and chill. In any case, the next 4 years would only have been time wasted (as if anyone would actually have “prepared” under a second term) interspersed with constant Trump betrayals on DACA and every other thing.

            Trump did really well with Hispanics- apparently he came close to flipping some Texas border counties that went 3:1 or 4:1 for Clinton in 2016. Hispanics really hate BLM!Kushner was overeager- it looks like the moment in which the GOP will be able to completely abandon their white base to Oxycontin while they pander exclusively to the brown “family values” plurality is still 4 or 8 years away.The “abandon the white base to drugs and pander to everyone else” strategy juuuust didn’t make it in 2020, but by the next presidential election it will probably be a safe strategy.Problem is, the Democrats have the same strategy, so which party will win the hearts and minds of the new brown plurality? I think a comment below was prescient: the two parties will probably merge into one with dynastic rule for decades, like the PRI in Mexico.The PRI’s full name, the “Institutional Revolutionary Party,” actually describes the woke globalism of the GOP and Democrats to a tee.

                        I’m not against the wall. However, it was clear that it would take years, require funding from congress and could still contain the “big, beautiful doors” that Trump often mentioned. High profile deportations would have been quicker, cheaper.

                I don’t blame him for the riots – that was on the local Dem poles who let it burn, and they deserved it.  Fuck them.
The mask/Covid fraud was more on him, although for the most part he left it up to the states to decide.
No, what did it in for him was the blatant POC pandering, without giving any support to his own battered supporters.  Where was his “if I had another son he would be Cannon Hinnant” moment?

                    I get your point, but that said, I can’t get my head around an “America First” president who would let his country burn.  Yes, I get the details of how it’s a local problem, but it was always bigger than that.  He owed it to the country to do something real and concrete.   My two cents

            I remember at his rallies, he always talked about Hispanic and black and asian unemployment. But not white men. The 99% white male crowd cheered a bit.
It would be funny if it was the alt-right guys who ended up sinking him. He did perform better with Hispanics.

        The in your face voter fraud by the Dems shows they are willing to to burn down the house so to speak in order to win.Won’t work, the people I’ve talked and the ones my brother talked to in UT, ID and MT all said the same thing before the election that they expected the Dems to cheat on a massive scale. And these folks are mostly normies. .IOW the Dems are fooling no one on this and a lot of Trump supporters are seething.That said FoxNews destroyed it’s credibility with a lot conservatives with being so in the tank for Biden. Really putting Wallace and Brazile to analyze election results? No one was buying that.

        I think it was the death knell of heritage America. Yeah you could put a silver lining on it as you could anything. But the thing that brought it home to me was that Texas was hanging in the balance for so long. Texas used to be the counterweight to California. Now it’s becoming the second California. Demographics really is destiny. And that means America is not America anymore. Was this a 4 yr reprieve?? Maybe, who knows how this chaos ends. But on the longer trends it just showed that the time is up for heritage America. In four years heritage Americans won’t stand a chance.Whites WILL become a minority in America, the real question is how to deal with that. Splitting up the country seems the least bad choice, and that is coming from a Lincoln admirer…

        Yesterday, I saw the long line at our polling place and I wanted to leave. My wife talked me into staying and we waited the hour and a half to cast our ballots.I knew in my heart that that my ballot would be invalidated because some Democrat hack election officials in deep blue areas would stop the counting of legitimate ballots so they could wait for the results from other parts of the state so they could insertjust enough“ballots” that were waiting in the trunk of someone’s car to swing the race in their candidate’s favor.It’s already happened in Michigan. Wisconsin too.https://twitter.com/DarylMSimpson/status/1324029786117779456?s=20They have no problem delegitimizing the system because they never believed in our system of government anyhow. The anti-white pogroms and the PC nonsense, coupled with all of the energy-related stuff and the destruction of the Second Amendment are going to make this a LONG four years with no chance of redemption since elections are now meaningless. They’re as useful as the Soviet ones.It’s hard to believe in a country with this level of technology that we can’t have a better voting system to eliminate fraud. Oh, that’s right, that isn’t wanted by our betters.Thanks to demographic change from the influx of foreigners and blue state goodwhite numbnuts, Georgia is starting to turn purplish much as Virginia and North Carolina did. These goodwhite dickheads in their Subarus who shop at Whole Foods, worry about trannies and their precious carbon footprint are slowly turning the South into a battleground area, which doesn’t bode well for Republicans and white folks going forward.They flee their miserable Blue states and come south for lower taxes and a lower cost of living, yet take their idiotic voting habits with them. They’re like locusts, destroying everything in one area and moving on to pillage another district.I’m sick of it. I think Trump would stave off the nonsense for the next four years, but the accelerationists are going to get what they want and I don’t think it’ll be a good thing, save that a lot more people will join us on our side of the great divide.

        I find it fascinating.  It’s like an electoral hurricane that’s hitting land at just the right place for maximum political impact.  Whether it spits out an illegitimate Alzheimer’s patient and his whore sidekick or the orange clown, either way, maximum impact.  Obviously my own state CA has no future but that’s a given.  We’ll be southern Italy in 10 years.  Yet more incentive to move.  I see moving vans being the big winner in this election.

                I’m more than happy to leave soon, and now a felon can vote in my place.  I love how we rejected the Prop that would have clamped down on shoplifting, as even chain stores are closing from rampant theft.  Everyone will be ordering their groceries online soon as no one will physically be allowed in the stores.  But the demographics, even in the 80s, pointed to this future.

                    I moved to CA from FL 22 years ago. When I lived in FL it was in south FL. Don’t recommend that as it is heavily jewish and diverse.I am looking at the Nocatee/Ponte Vedra area in St Johns County. Saw a promotional video and noticed it was filled with white people with one obligatory negro in the background. Definitely an under the radar appeal to whites. No large college or corporation either. Far enough north in the state for easy evacuation in event of hurricane.Check out the video:https://www.nocatee.com/

                You won’t have to pay for it. We are moving into a cashless economy with a guaranteed basic income (digital), which will simply be “generated” by Big Tech, which is going to replace all banks. It’s already a done deal in Europe, and the Dems introduced the “enabling legislation” in September to move us to a cashless economy. Their target date remains 1 January, although the Trump Revolution (which is what it is) might delay that for “vote counting” and all the lawfare and whatnot. Then the forced vaccinations. Global famine is right over the horizon, too.

                    I really like the Oregon coast and there are some red enclaves there. But the state has high income taxes. Also looked at Vancouver WA (no income tax) and right across the Columbia River from Oregon (no sales tax). But I am sure the area is flooded with Portlanders trying to recreate the mess they made on the other side of the river.So FL is the likely choice. Will have to get out of there between June and October.

A sprawling ugly bedroom community filled with fast food joints, ersatz Mongolian and Thai restaurants, miles of tacky strip malls, insane drivers and clueless libtards that are just now starting to understand what it means to be blessed with vibrancy. Cross it off your list.

                        I’ll second what Peabody said.  My job used to take me to Vancouver a lot.  What most surprised me was the way it was just sort of a vast sprawl of strip malls surrounding a decrepit haunted-looking downtown area.I also don’t recommend OR.  It’s hard to believe but our politics are actually even wackier than CA’s.  The problem is that, while CA actually has quite a few based, heritage whites, everyone in Oregon seems to have moved here less than 20 years ago, preciselybecauseit’s so Left wing.  As a result the whites here are actually more liberal than the few minorities we have.  It’s why it was white Antifa, not the blacks who burned Portland (and will soon be burning it again).  They will keep on voting in wammen governors forever and those income taxes you mentioned will be paying for them to build more light rail in Portland to move “peaceful protesters” from riot, to weed shop, to microbrew pub, to rehab clinic.  Oh, and the weather really isTHATbad.  Portland only gets 39″ of rain a year but it all falls as drizzle and mist that drags on for weeks on end in the winter and spring.  Yes, that’s right, even our famous rain here is fake and ghey.

                                    So I ask myself WTF we can move. Until about three years ago, I went out into the Alaskan bush for ten days alone every other year. The real deal. My former jump buddy operates a float and bush pilot business there. But where he lives on the coast it is very very shit lib. So where to go. The Ozarks? Not the kind of winter I require. We are former patrons of Telluride CO but that place is now Cali-NY despite the altitude. We’re running out of territory for serious social distancing.

There are pockets of negroes, but they are easily avoided. Outside of OKC and Tulsa, Oklahoma is hardcore redneck country.

            Those fleeing now have to forget about finding a like-minded state – you have to focus on rural counties to find pockets of sanity.  Obviously steer well clear of urban areas.  Ask prospectvive counties about their “master plan” for “progress and growth” … if they have one, run in another direction.  Check for preferred demographics via census stats.  Ditto for education and income.  For those serious about moving, know in advance that everything is a trade off; e.g. want airport and interstate proximity?  So do progressives.  Want great public amenities?  So do progressives. Wonderful restaurants and Starbucks?  Etc.  One thing about states though … find one that confiscates the least given your income and investment portfolio.  I like TN; YMMV.Dissidents need to be prepared to go places where life is a little harder, a little colder, and/or a little more rustic.  One thing I’ve learned in the boonies these last 10 years … joggers don’t like hard work.  If you go where the demographics revolve around dirt-under-the-fingernail laborers – loggers, cowboys, fishermen and farmers – then you won’t find many joggers, lesbians, Marxist academics or skinny jean wearing girly-men with $100 hairdos.Last piece of advice – don’t move to the sticks and then commence to complain about crappy schools, crappy roads, crappy internet, etc.  Coalition building will be key to your new move.  Go somewhere where YOU can make things better.  Have something to offer your new community.  Your new neighbors won’t want to hear about how great the amenities were back in Wonderland.

                You want to avoid any town with a university beyond a community college. Also no significant presence of large corporations. For demographic info, the census is probably no longer reliable. I didn’t even answer this year. What I do for local demographics is look at the local schools on greatschools.com. They are updated annually and since they think diversity is a virtue, they don’t hide it.

            White Pill Time.First, President Trump is a fighter and not out yet.More important and this will sound like a Black Pill, its not.US society is immiserated to the point that no one who participates in it wants to have children. The fertility rate is at an all time low and has been lower every year for year after year, Replacement is 2.1The Latino TFR is now 1.8 which while a tiny bit higher than White at 1.6  is below replacement, so is the Black, Asian, Amerind and every group except  Pacific Islanders (2.1)  highly religious who are at about 3 or more for Orthodox and the Amish at around 7  who double every 2 decades!Even during the Trump Microboom , the TFR went down again and again.We live in a  a failed society and no candidate has a plan to fix it because frankly it can’t be .The population will decline and eventually only the faithful will remain. And yes its possible that we could try to bring in more Nigerians. I suspect they are too intractable for the Elite and frankly while they will say the opposite, the Woke are very racist as are the Left.This tell me that if the DR grabs some land during the inevitable chaos and can goose fertility up a bit over time, they can win.A 35% fertility increase will not be easy but its doable and in time with effort you can pull your own Reconqusita and have the nation you want.Get an ideology that works first and apply the requires long term thinking and effort while  not despairing at the drop of a hat and you can have it.

            His decline in white male support lines up almost exactly with the supposed alt-right numbers. He did better with Latinos but his margins were lower in the rural upper midwest – fraud or not.

                “All that pandering, kissing rapper ass and Platinum Plan gave Blompf a 0.6% increase in the vote while losing a full 5% of the white male vote. This was by far the stupidest campaign in Banana Republic of America history!”https://twitter.com/HiseFrank/status/1324017801565147136For months there was a meme/warning going around that Trump would lose the white nationalist vote. Coupled with the studies showing how a significant minority of white men have white nationalist views, it looks like that meme came true.Trump ignored white men, and it cost him the election. Kushner miscalculated that the increase in nonwhite votes would make up for white men.

            The funny thing is that despite the uptick in support from minorities (are they even minorities at this point, or are we?), there was no Blexit. Yet the Kirk/Shapiro/Walsh/Owens wing of the GOP keeps panting over a Blexit…any day now.
You can bet in 2024 they’ll be desperately searching for another Blexit.

                The good thing about the election is that it’s now completely clear republicans can never get appreciable amounts of black votes no matter what they do. If sucking up to blacks for years and promising $500 billion in free money when the other guy absolutely won’t do anything other than token gestures won’t do it, nothing ever will. That demographic is a lost cause and republicans should move away from any attempt to court them. Their vote is solely about racial loyalty — to their side — and nothing else.

        I feel sick — just as Z-man says, we are watching the election being stolen right before our eyes. I see a lot of people are feeling beyond sad, feeling hopeless, black-pilled, ready to quit. There is a part of me which feels the same way — but that is exactly what our enemies want and count on. We have to stay strong in the face of this treachery, this outrageous affront to our traditions. We have to find ways to fight back effectively. It may take years, it may take decades, but we can never, ever give up. This is going to take a lot of mutual encouragement and support in the times to come. We just have to find it within ourselves to carry on. The words of Martin Luther are an inspiration to me at this time — “Here I stand. I can do no other.”

                        It started with changing election rules 30 days out so as not to require postmarks as to when mail-in ballots were received. Whether you want to hear it or not, there was massive fraud, probably unprecedented in Western history, and that assumes you can call the United States a Western nation at this point.
That’s upside, though, because a substantial slice of Joe Normie World realizes what a grubby police state this is now.
Just to be clear: you think this election is legitimate? Because that is an interesting take.

                    The enemy will fail because it only succeeds through destruction of its own foundation (e.g., elections, “fairness”, a functioning economy/polity, etc.).  While it will temporarily gain, it will ultimately lose.  It can take a while – the USSR staggered on for 60 yrs or so, Rome a couple centuries.  This a marathon, not a sprint.  The enemy is sprinting.

        Forgive me. I have read no MSM account of the election and my only exposure to what has been happening is here on Z man’s blog. By far the most reliable account. Already, in my UK based office I had one colleague sound off this morning about ‘another four more years of Trump’… I assume from comments here that it is as yet undecided but looking likely for Biden?In any case, the gloves are now off. If Biden has won, and we see a continuation of all the nonsense the last year has thrown at us; well, there is no nasty orange man to blame now. In a way, as much as it pains me to say it (and I regret saying it as I am not in the US – in the firing line) it is one step closer to linking madness and decline with Democrats and your whole system in general. I know it has been said billions of time before, but an event that hastens the exposure of the system has it’s silver lining.Like I say though, I am in the relative safety of the UK, and don’t consider myself in immediate physical danger – from rogue as well as State operatives. Godspeed to all of you.Also, I am glad that many of the comments here so far express a will to continue and not mope about. Self pity is something that needs to be marshaled strongly.

            The decline will not be linked to the powers, like the soviet union it will all be the fault of “wreckers” secret bad thinkers like you and me who must be rooted out by informants and crushed together with all of their families.  Like how the corona always spreads, not because masks and lockdowns never worked, but because of the few dissenters who visited their grandma or didn’t wear a mask at the park.
This is how authoritarianism works.  The collapse will just be used as cause to inflict further suffering on the system’s enemies.

        What We Learned. If this is boring as fuzzy winter dog poop and you have no time for reading, skip to the last line!A Biden Presidency Will Mean a Faster US Collapse. Note the term Faster. Under Trump, somewhat controlled collapse. Plausible arguments for the globalists guiding the strings attached to the puppets.https://alt-market.us/a-biden-presidency-will-mean-a-faster-us-collapse/“Biden is a full blown globalist and is proud of it;Trump is surrounded by globalistsand banking elites in his own cabinet. Regardless of who loses the election, the elites win. The only question I am here to ask is, which candidate serves the globalist agenda most effectively right now?Trump would preside over America’s rapid decline and that conservative ideals and principles would be blamed by extension.Andbehold, in 2020 this isexactly what is happening, witha pandemicand theimplosion of the “Everything Bubble”now in full swing and the media placing it all in the lap of Trump and conservatives.With Biden in office the time frame changes completely and the crash must move faster. Why? Because the globalists cannot allow a Biden Administration (and by extension the globalists themselves) to be labeled as the culprits behind the crash. They would have to expedite the downturn in the early months of Biden’s first term so that the media can claim the crisis is an aftereffect of Trump’s presidency.If Biden does enter the White House in 2021, expect a hard plunge in economic fundamentals almost immediately.Another factor of a Biden presidency would be the near certainty of federally enforced pandemic lockdowns similar to those now being implemented in countries like France and Germany. Forget about the current state-by-state lockdown orders and nuances; Biden will go for broke, attempt a national lockdown, and the economy will take another massive hit as more businesses go into bankruptcy at breakneck speed. And again, this would have to be implemented quickly so that Trump and conservatives can be blamed. They will claim harsh lockdowns “have to be pursued” because conservatives refused to accept them during the early stages of the pandemic.In light of a Trump “win”, it is obvious that a second term would be used as an invitation for mass demonstrations and riots by extreme leftists, but, this threat doesn’t go away with Biden in office. Actually, the riots may become worse under Biden. The social justice cult will see Biden as a “malleable” and easily controlled political figure who will do anything to appease them. Biden will placate the hard left; not because he fears them, but because he has a role to play in this great Kabuki theater and it serves the interests of the globalist agenda at the moment.Finally, if the establishment puts Biden in the White House it means they want national gun restrictions or outright confiscation within the first couple years of his term. With Trump, the chances of a gun grab are much slimmer (though he hasvoiced support for Red Flag lawsin the past). Under Biden, the gun grab attempt will be swift. This threat along with Level 4 lockdowns on a national level would elicit the only logical response for conservatives – armed rebellion.I do not think this is what the globalists want at this point in time. I do not think they have the capacity to handle it, and I do not think they would be able to get a majority of law enforcement and the military to go along with such policies. This is why I continue to believe they prefer Trump in office and that they will use economic decline and the “failure” of conservative policies as a false rationale for the “global reset” the elites seem to be so excited about.”Be warned, however, that if Biden ends up in office, this should be treated as a sign that a high speed collapse is on the way.

            As I’ve said in previous posts, the next term 2021-2025 will be a tar baby term.  Many, Many chickens coming home to roost, and especially debt chickens. Personal..corporate…date…local..Federal…. The next President, whomever it is, will be the most hated in US history.  Guaranteed.  So why not an Alzheimer’s patient who won with nefarious 3:30am ballots?  The owners of society should have been thrilled that Trump would be re-elected.  Instead they own this tar baby.  Trump is a used condom who sold out the white man by 2017.  It’s sickening to go through, but there’s no way, with this outcome, that either can govern legitimately.  The civ-nats are being mugged by reality right now, and they should be.  We should all be relieved that the talking heads like Sean Hannity are no longer parroting “record black employment.”  As if they want to be employed.

                Trump is a used condom who sold out the white man by 2017.Hey there friendo, that’s not exactly the most respectful way to talk about a guy who volunteered to go from a well liked retired billionaire celeb be the most hated person on the planet with the most powerful enemies on the planet…But hey, I’m sure you’ve given up a lot more than he has and accomplished a lot more.  So I can see why you have the moral authority to hold him in total contempt for not having achieved single handed total victory.Oh by the way, would you please go ahead and save the white race… maybe after lunch tomorrow?  Since Trump was a “used condom” for failing at something so obvious that anyone could do it.  I’m sure a brave pseudonymous hero like you can get er done no sweat.  Thanks a million!

                    I know the truth hurts.  Put some ice on it.  Do you think Trump has done anything in his life that’s not 99% about himself or 1% for Ivanka?  He’s a fraud and a talker.  But don’t look at his words, look at his accomplishments.  When he had the court victories to pull the trigger on sanctuary cities, he didn’t.  He has had court victories (thanks to Sessions) and never applied them.   Immigration is the 1st, 2nd and 3rd most important issue in this country.  I could go on, but it would be lost on you anyway.

                        I’d be interested to know how making your name the most poisonous epithet known to the global power elite gives you and your family a big leg up.Because I was thinking a little and it seems to me that if I was in it for personal gain and was a famous billionaire already… well MAYBE instead of doing THAT I might…simply buy my kid a cushy no show corporate job, media career, a bottomless slush fund in the form of an eponymous “foundation”, maybe a nice mansion or two, ala Chelsea Clinton and Hunter Biden…But I’m probably missing something here.  Like I think having my own successful TV show and a chain of luxury hotels would be pretty cool.  Become internationally hated for expressing public sympathy with working white christians though?  Not really seeing the big additional dividends there so far.

                                I’m plussing both of your comments, and I’m not meaning to virtue signal by saying that but to point out that i see things from both sides and agree with both of you. At the end of the day, as much as I like Trump for pissing off all of the world’s most annoying and insufferable maggots, JR Wirth is right, in the sense that, when you are a billionaire contrarian, you are in the sweetest of spots. Trump is a rebel heathen driven by ego. I can relate. He is not taking on our enemies because he is a white knight. In the end though, it’s all the same! God bless him!

                                        I wouldn’t disagree. But you have people on this side who might argue that is just called winning at evolution. We need a manifesto. There are so many different fucking opinions about who and what we are and what our thing actually is, it’s a giant clusterfuck. I find extreme individualism in the form of carpetbagging capitalism that yields a society where people can accrue billions repugnant, not because I‘m a hater or jealous of another man’s achievement or potential, but because the myopia of such pathological individualism, as someone quoted here a few days ago, is so god damned retarded to me. Many in our thing would look at me as genetic garbage low energy commie fag for feeling that way, and yet, here I am, and I will share a foxhole with that person to preserve ‘white’ people, because i’ve connected the dots, even if I am a weary dumbass.

                        Sure, Trump was disappointing and frustrating in a lot of ways… but let’s go ahead and acknowledge that he was miles ahead of anyone else we had or were likely to have.I don’t know about you, but I have available degrees of opinion between utter perfection and “used condom”.  The man went through a lot that he didn’t have to, and took some hard knocks that VERY FEW would and he deserves some respect from our side at leastI’m also not fond of our tendency to shoot our own side for any deviation or qualified success.  One of the reasons we have trouble finding leaders… you get to be slaughtered by everyone.  The left on the other hand is very supportive of their folks so long as they don’t what?  publicly sodomize kids I guess? And even then… eh well there’s Roman Polanski and Bryan Singer and…I think we could find a middle ground where we just try not to fling feces at one another for the slightest pretext.

Trump is the good candidate.

                                I guessing that what you mean by hardcore WN set are the TRS clan. And that is not what they believed. Their basic analysis was that Trump was doing worse than nothing and keeping White people asleep by just tweeting that he was their guy. I don’t agree with their belief that Trump losing was better, but I disagree even more with your characterization of their opinion.

                If Biden is installed, the debt you mention simply won’t matter. We ae going to be forced into a cashless economy. And that might very well happen even if Trump is installed.“It’s sickening to go through, but there’s no way, with this outcome, that either can govern legitimately.”The operative word being, “legitimately.”  And “govern” should probably be “rule.” It’s already a done deal in Europe: travel restrictions, lockdowns, cashless economy, universal basic income (at 80% of your current income), all of it. Only Trump and the US stand in the globalists’ triumph, which, happily, will ultimately fail b/c there will be revolutions and civil wars. And famines. But between now and their ultimate failure to sustain their Global State there will be a lot of unpleasantness.

        I think it’s kind of telling that the Democrats aren’t trying to steal any Congressional seats.  They appear to be willing to let Republicans win Senate and House seats without “harvesting” the votes they need to overturn results  like they did in 2018.  I think they are well aware that the nutless wonders in the GOP will start elbowing one another aside to be the first to call on Trump to step aside once the MSM has declared Groping Joe the winner.

        The Republicans should start cheating back.  Nevada says they won’t count any more ballots until Thursday for some reason. Why not just start printing up Trump ballots in the counties around Lake Tahoe like the Democrats did for Biden in Michigan and Wisconsin?  If Trump wins Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada he makes 270.

        We also had further confirmation that politics as a replacement for religion for the average Democrat voter.  They had multiple Senate races where they wasted over $100 million or close to it and didn’t come close to winning.  The middle class Democrats who donate to these races are the equivalent of Christians who give money to TV evangelists like Jimmy Bakker and Kenneth Copeland.  That campaign consultants make huge money on these races is not even a secret anymore, there is just no excuse for giving money.

        A contested election is bad for ending the Covid hysteria.

A clear Biden win would have been a return to normalcy.

A clear Trump victory could have been a mandate to end it.

Now the face mask will be the required mark of obedience to the elite who were unable to gain a clear cut victory.

                    It’s called a “Color Revolution”, and the color of ours is Black (how appropriate is that?).  It is a combination of burning down the physical landscape, destroying the country’s political and social institutions from within, and turning the population against itself.  They have practiced this stuff for a long time, mostly in Eastern Europe (to keep the newly freed Soviet satellite states from establishing themselves), and now it is our turn, the big enchilada.

            They’ll probably have Biden wearing a mask with a little recorder in it projecting his voice as if he’s talking live during the oath taking because there’s no way that potato makes it thru the all day ceremonies with enough active brain cells left to carry it off. No ball either which will be blamed on The Rona but it’s really cause it will be way past his bedtime.

        “What We Learned”, if we didn’t already know it, is YT is as soft as puppy shit. We will be getting royally screwed, and in the end, it is deserved. I’m reading graphs that show 9 of the most contested states have more votes cast than registered voters. And what’s going to be done about it? Nothing. Just a shoulder shrug.These were the good times that make weak men. The dark times ahead will forge strong men. That’s the way of the world. I wish it wasn’t so.

        I’ve been ranking the possible outcomes of the election in my head for a couple weeks now,  focusing on what was going to be best for my long term goal of the National Divorce.  The best outcome for that project is the result we appear to be getting: Trump loses narrowly with a credible argument that it was due to fraud.If Trump had won by a landslide, the extreme lunatics on the left might have become convinced that they needed to start pushing for dissolution since the country is so full of deplorables and haters.  The problem would be that a decisive Trump victory would empower the Civnats.  They’d want to fight to keep the union instead of just letting the leftists go.The same dynamic, but in reverse, would have applied if Biden had won decisively enough that the blatant cheating we’re seeing now had been unnecessary.   Ned Normie and Chuckie Civnat would be ready to accept that outcome.   It’s the idea that Biden will have not won fair and square that will stick with (some) of them and push them to our side.Even now my normiecon friends are holding out hope that the courts will be able to fix this.   I hope they don’t.  Other than I would have liked another four years to prep some more,  there’s no point in continuing to put off the inevitable. The sooner Ned and Chuckie understand how broken the system is, the sooner they’ll look to repair it.

            Laura Ingraham and the fox cucks are now saying that a diverse latino party is the future for the GOP. They don’t understand Latinos, they don’t want pandering and low tax they want a big man they respect like Trump.
Leftist secession would be more dems are the real racists, confederacy 2.0!
I think the best outcome for our side is for trump to miraculously win in court. Normies see what happened but still have 4 more years to prep and radicalize.

                    No one in the continental US is “prepped”.  Some people are LARPing more and some less and some not at all.  If you’re chilling in an apartment in Bangkok or have a dacha outside Moscow then yeah, maybe you’re set to survive a civil war in the US without unimaginable risk and hardship.  Otherwise you’re swimming in the same toilet as everyone else if it comes down to it.

                            If you think a panic room is going to mean anything in a civil war you’re in a world of surprise.My country went through a civil war a century ago (Finland), and the policy of both White and Red armies went like this:a) Anyone outside of the White/Red army found in possession of a firearm is to be executed on the spotb) Any house that doesn’t agree to be searched for firearms, enemy literature is going to be lit on fire or reduced to rubble with explosivesIndividual prepping is worse than useless. The more you prep, the more you get treated as a threat by all sides that you refuse to joinYou’re going to come out of that panic room or you’ll die in there.

                    To clarify: Prep more.  Was hoping that a Trump win would put the brakes on the ammo panic, bring the supply up and these panic prices down.

                No. The immediate future is unimaginable to most in the country, including the commentariat here. BTW, I recommend Madison (Madison County) Florida for you.

            Based, this is exactly where I have been for months. Trump’s greatest achievements were inadvertent but profound. His election and the Empire’s reaction to it revealed what a grubby Third World shithole the nation had become. Even so, NormieCons never would have acknowledged it until…they voted for his re-election, he apparently won it, and then had the victory stolen from him (this appears to be where this lands). I’m certain the Left will try to move as far and as quickly as possible to dilute this nation further with foreigners, but a big slice of the Muh Constitution types now know there is no reason to keep alive the fantasy of their freedom and rights, which have been stolen from them.

                I don’t think “they” mean to fill the country with more foreigners. More likely is total lockdowns and NO TRAVEL for anybody from anywhere to anywhere. It’s part of the Great Reset. The travel restrictions are already in place in most of Europe. ANd the cashless economy is a done deal there, too, and the date for that to take effect here is still 1 January. The legislation was introduced in September, although they might not bother with niceties like legislation. The European governments didn’t.

        The Left are really good at rigging.

There are multiple reports across the country that polling stations only had Sharpies available to mark ballots.

Sharpies that bleed through the ballot paper and render it invalid/uncountable.

AP will call the election this afternoon and Biden will declare victory tonight.

I say this from CO which is now full retard like Oregon and blue prog from top to bottom. I should have left when the frogs started turning gay.
Lots of big Trump caravans in these states but the goodwhites voted against Trump and not for Biden; no need for a parade when that is your motivation.

The LDS church is, like water on rocks, pushing beyond loving the gay kids to eventually festooning the chapel with Rainbows.

            The left all but came out and promised they would rig this election.  So the question is, what did the right do to respond?  I’m not talking about putting steps in place to ensure a proper counting of the votes, either.Ace reports that a thumb drive with 128,000 votes — all of them for Joe Biden — appeared in Michigan in the middle of the night.  I have no idea if that’s true, but let’s say it is.  Why, then, didn’t the GOP show up a half hour later with a thumb drive containing 129,000 votes for Trump?  How could they not have plans in place to counteract every bit of leftist chicanery that Stevie Wonder could have seen coming months ago?

                If lots of convenient trump votes showed up at a key time media would instantly call fraud, the three letter agencies would be out in force the same night, the votes would be thrown out, and a whole bunch of people would be going to jail.I understand it emotionally but we’ve got to get over the double standard meme. It’s obvious enough by now that they don’t care and aren’t bothered about appearances. They want you dead or a slave, anything that helps make you dead or a slave is legal, anything that impedes that is illegal. This is the essence and internal logic of the system.

                    I’m not concerned about the appearance of a double standard.  I’m talking about our guys learning that they have to kick, scratch, and claw better than the opposition.  So what if people “go to jail”?  Tear down the walls and free them.  Give judges an offer they can’t refuse.  This is what’s eventually going to have to happen and I don’t see the point in putting it off any longer.

                    We saw four young white boys playing on their bicycles in the desert the other day. I can no longer ride in the sand, not having the requisite leg strength.

        If Trump ultimately does lose, I wish to thank all of you on behalf of Illinois, the most corrupt state in the, ahem, union. Your gracious personal wealth will be transferred to bail us out from generations of our public theft and gross mismanagement. We shall be enabled to bleed you dry with clever, punitive taxes even past the point you believe you could possibly bear. Please smile when your new overlords JB Pritzker, his sister who formerly was his brother, and Lori Lightfoot issue their many edicts for your swift compliance. Remember to pay on time!

            McConnell already signaled this morning that he will cave on state and local aid in a Coronavirus aid package to be passed this year. Here come the bailouts for CA, NY, NJ, IL, and KY. Time to fire up the money printer.I was all in on holding the line for another four years of Trump to buy some time for planning, but with Trump out I’m jumping back on the acceleration wagon. Let’s turn the Senate blue in ’22 and give Americans what they deserve, good and hard.Still interested in touching bases with you if you are planning an exit from Chicago.

        We ALL knew the left was going to cheat…on a biblical scale. Even MY DOG knew it. The problem is the system is SO CORRUPT that the left no longer even TRIES to hide the fact they are cheating. They have only one rule. WIN! And ANYTHING they do to achieve that goal is acceptable. The notion of “rule of law” is a convenient fiction to the left. A tool to use when it serves them, an archaic pointless notion to ignore when it doesn’t serve them. And normal, honest conservatives are too polite, too honest, too enslaved by the loyalty to the idea of “rule of law” to realize that no matter what we do the left always wins…..because we follow rules and they only follow the one rule…..WIN! If NOW is not the time to “pop P Mags”, “step off the porch”, begin the “Boogaloo” then the time is never going to arrive. And being polite, honest and lawful will be the epitaphs that end up on our graves and the slogans the left puts up above the gates to the camps they are planning for all of us who dared oppose their divine (satanic) right to rule.

            The Left’s cheating is not hidden, in part because revealing it further divides our nation and turns our people against each other.  It’s part of the psyops going on here, to break us down.  The genius of it is there really isn’t a good response to it, unless all sides agree to drop the arguments—which the Lefties will never do, as they have been too intensely indoctrinated into their side of the game.

        Here’s a must-watch. Soviet KGB defector Yuri Bemenov lecturing around 1984. He sounds like he was watching us through a time machine, and he tells the people then how they can prevent us from getting to where we are.Understanding the Modern Political ScenarioAt least every minute in the video there is an insight that makes me want to pound my head on the desk because it’s 40 years too late, but here’s one I thought was particularly apropos about reversing the process of demoralization:At that point, at the point of destabilization, also this could be reversed, again, easier than this [crisis stage]. No CIA involvement at this point. You know what it takes here? Restriction of some liberties for small groups which are self-declared enemies of the society. Simple as that.‘Oh, no,’ the media and liberals will tell you. ‘This is against the American Constitution. How can we by force deny the civil rights to criminals?’ for example. ‘Not good!’ So, okay, you allow the criminals to have civil rights. Go on, bring the country to the crisis. This is the bloodless way to do it. Curb the rights. I’m not to put them in prison. No, no, I’m not talking about putting all the gays from San Francisco into the concentration camp. Do not allow them to take political force. Do not elect them to the seats of power, whether it is municipality level, state level, federal level. It has to be bitten in the heads of American voters: a person like that in the seats of power is an enemy. Do not be afraid of this word. It is an enemy. If he is not an enemy here [points to chart of subversion stages on board, of screen], he will be here [points to another spot on off-screen board]. Later on, he will be shot, of course [call back to earlier point in the talk where he says the early destabilization agents are always eliminated after their purpose is fulfilled]. But at this point he is an enemy.You are doing him a great service by denying him a right to capitalize on his own crazy ideas and become a powerful man, a man who uses the seat of power.

                    They control the federal government. There is nowhere to go. Obama spent years flooding republican districts across the country with refugees and immigrants .There is nowhere you can go when they control the government, increasingly at all levels, including state governments. What’s the point of moving to a red state that’s quickly turning blue? Where can you go that they can’t follow? Where isn’t susceptible to demographic change? Where is it impossible for the Biden administration to amnesty illegals or sue your community for not being diverse enough or import refugees or build section 8 housing or bus in members of other communities to your schools or deny loans and federal aid until you embrace diversity? Answer: nowhere. But I’m sure you knew that.

            Please stop with that scam Agent Mulder. It’s obvious nonsense meant to dox posters along with diverting attention to ultimately unproductive endeavors. Do not exchange contact information with this poster or meet up with him in the real world, as he’s often tried to set up. You’re NOT building any communites in this country under mass immigration, when the secret police are everywhere, when the other side controls a government that could easily break up your community any time they want just as Zimbabwe stole White communities in that country. Any claim to the contrary is based on either incompetence or delusion — or both. Stop with this nonsense. It’s a fruitless scam to sucker simpletons.Move where that can’t be flooded with diversity? Didn’t you say Montana the other day? Well, that state is well on its way to becoming another Colorado, so that’s a waste of time. Same with every other suggestion you’ve made. There is nowhere to go in this system that they can’t take from you. There are hundreds of prior examples. Just how stupid is the right to fall for this? The NFW was famous for being an FBI honeypot and NOTHING ever came of it. Duh. Waste. Of. Time. Yet I still see this stuff floating around.

        Note that there was extremely little rioting and looting last night.

It’s almost as if the people in charge knew that is a terrible look and called the whole thing off.

The few scuffles in DC appear to be the work of the lunatics and true believers

            To be fair, his cray-cray was not in calling a Trumpslide, but in thinking the Dems would allow a Trumpslide (particularly after the 2016 debacle).  Had this been a truly free and fair election, Trumpslide would likely have happened.  But we haven’t had a free and fair election around these parts in at least 100 years, 2016 being an aberration because the Dems thought, for once, they did not have to cheat much.

        Look, Amy Coney Barret is about to become the most powerful woman in the world. With the fate of a nation in her well-manicured hands. Hands filled with virtue. Mind filled with neutrality, objectivity.A saint.And IMO she no sooner was confirmed when she signaled to the real ‘big guy’ that she planned to revert to form. After all, she is a classic “liberal” as defined not very long ago.As a betting man, she ends up the pivotal ‘justice’ … she will screw the pooch. The media will sell you this crap sandwich and you’ll either have to eat it, and ask for more … or take to the forests.

        The only upside to an overt theft of the election (and putting a dementia patient in charge of the sole remaining superpower) is that we hit bottom sooner. Then the real fun begins. There will be Jackboots and there will be real pain. Smarter now is imperative. Go dark, it’s pretend Walter Mitty time. Stay off the Fed radar. Be patient, ready, and focused.

                        Martin Armstrong has warned about The Great Reset.  Destroy the economy and then rebuild it in the name of fighting climate change and the Chinese Flu.  It’s  the Green New Deal on steroids and will massively increase government power.  People will lose their jobs and businesses and then be provided with a UBI to sit home and watch tv.  The elites think that they won’t rebel because they won’t bite the hand that feeds them.  The Great Reset is intended to be imposed on the entire world, but China and Russia won’t go along with it.  Pres. Trump is blocking their plan to impose it on the United States, so he needs to go.Mr. Armstrong’s thinking is that history is cyclical, not linear.  His computer software program “Socrates” projected that Pres. Trump would win re-election by a narrow margin and that 2020 would be the most corrupt and violent in American history.  Civil war is here and 2024 may be the last election.  WWIII may break out in the mid 2020s, China will become the world’s premier financial power in 2032 and the US may cease to exist after 2034.https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/

                        When you step on a cockroach, you are not technically engaging in a fight. So, with due respect to Tzu, the supra-supreme art of war is to step on the cockroach when he doesn’t see it coming.

                    To be honest I don’t want to stay alive in a soft or hard tyranny.  If it came to that I’d just be seriously contemplating the best most responsible place and time to draw a line in the sand and get killed rather than submit.  They intentionally make it hard to develop that resolve though… it’s always only a little indignity here or a friendly face passing on government edicts there.  Eventually you’re transformed from a man into a worm and stored away in a dark cold box somewhere.Everyone should read the gulag archipelago, it’s useful context for a lot of realistic futures we need to be personally and communally avoiding.

                    Would be nice, but we should understand that normie truth is filtered through a dozen layers of press manipulation.
That’s how Trump went from funny, warm, avuncular and boisterous guy with a common touch… to insane orange man bad.
Bland impersonal egotist Obama became a charismatic savior.  Hell they even convinced nice white ladies that big mike is a glamorous graceful lady through constant repetition and liberal photoshop.
Most people’s (read: most MSM consumers) sense of reality is stage managed to an almost unbelievable degree.

        Question, election related, not necessarily topic related: AL, MS and LA all have high diversity 27%+, yet quickly called for the red team.  Do the whites there know what they’re in for if they don’t vote red, so fewer go blue?  Based on % numbers MS voted along demographic lines… Can someone in one of these states provide feedback?  Just curious…

Do the whites there know what they’re in for if they don’t vote red, so fewer go blue? … Can someone in one of these states provide feedback?I’m a lifelong resident of Louisiana. Most whites are Republican/conservative. This is true even for upper middle class whites as well. I don’t think I can explain why because it’s all I have really known. In day to day life, you generally assume whites that you encounter are Republicans and blacks are Democrats. If you are dealing with a white person who has  children (including women), it’s almost a certainty.Just as with terms like “joggers”, people will actually use the term “Democrats” to refer to blacks.  For example, if a school is heavily black, you might say, “they’re are a lot of Democrats at that school.”I’ve many times encountered people (who aren’t from the most educated or worldly crowd) who will be genuinely surprised that majorities of whites vote Democrat in other parts of the country. It’s accepted as a fact of life that almost all blacks are Democrats and most whites are Republicans.

                Thanks for the insight…  I have customers in LA and MS in a very blue collar industry so I know how they’re skewed…   I just don’t have insight as to why Suzie homemaker in suburban Dallas votes blue, but the same demo in AL, MS, LA votes red…We also make reference to Democrats (for the demographic), although sometimes the reference is Canadians…  Only the really red-pilled (Is that right, I get my pill colors mixed up), get the jogger reference…

                    All of the states you referenced have large negro populations.  So the white residents of those states deal with negroes on a regular basis.
I attended a majority negro high school.  Trust me, if you deal with negroes up close and personal on a daily basis for an extended period of time, you are immune from “white guilt” for life.  You will not vote for an anti-white political party.
I doubt many suburban housewives in Dallas have had much experience dealing with feral negroes in large numbers.

            Did the white lefties actually move to Canada let alone commit suicide when She failed to win? They just cried, drank boxed wine and wore their vagina hats. Bubba Trump will just cry, drink beer and wear their baseball cap with their favorite negro felon league logo. He’ll only kill himself if he loses his job due to “the pandemic.”

Despair at ‘losing their country’ will lead to more alcoholism and drug-use.  MAGA firearm ownership will do the rest
Melodramatic women are 5X more likely to attempt suicide, but quiet men are 5X more likely to succeed.  Why?  Guns.
We might want them to train their fire on their enemies but most will train it on themselves.

                    Ugh why? So sad.I see that I’ve lost my country too. But I’m not depressed about it. I’m angry, pumping the iron, finding stuff that interests me. Slowly killing yourself just seems like a cowardly way out. Check out of society but not out of life. They seem to not be able to separate the 2 things.
I’m still optimistic in the long term horizon.

                        For me, it is not a loss per se that is so disappointing, but knowing what could have been.  If 2016 Campaign Trump had been the reality of First Term Trump, we would be well on the way to fixing this place.  There was a glimmer of hope with 2020 Campaign Trump, particularly given his opposition, that maybe 2nd Term Trump might have been better.
What might have been hurts more.  Although I am more frustrated than depressed.

                    Guns and sincerity. Men are, in general, more sincere.I have severe depression. I have a job I like, an attractive wife, an intelligent and healthy 4-month-old son, hobbies, friends, and I am still fucked up. (The election hasn’t worsened it.)That said, I think I understand why: screens, bad meals, and life in the squalor of my woke city. It’s killing me. But everything else that I need to live is here.I feel overmatched.

Modern life is unhealthy for us. You’re not the only one for sure.
I have been depressed before, due to external circumstances, so I get it.

                        Congratulations on the baby! Clinical depression is no joke. Your GP will probably want to put you on SRIs. Before you do that, insist on a complete endocrine panel (which will tell you if you have out-of-wack hormones.)

                        Nice to see you didn’t get a lot of “man up” comments like I suspect you would for admitting that. Too many people on this side think its just “being soy” or whatever. The question about those committing suicide on our side is valid. When your “homeland” repudiates you, some are too far gone that this will be backbreaker.  No idea how much or if notable, but it will happen.  Especially given the hallowing out of the country further re: Covid. Stay strong, brother.

                        Food is a huge factor in feeling well.
For me personally, if I’m crushed for time I look for healthy grab and go options at the grocery store like a soup, salad, or other somewhat balanced meal.
If you’re really pressed, the big cans of Progresso soup are decent and cheap. Maybe a little high in sodium. 2 minutes in the microwave and you’ve got breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
Any of it is better for you than a McWoke gut bomb.

                        “There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.”

            They go from Fluffy Bunnies and Unicorns to Suicide in an earthquake moment!? This does sound heartless…And…if we have descended to the level of no inner resources or resilience, no common sense or ability to deal with reality, then this is the beginning of the great culling. Not much can save them. I’ve seen people make a lifetime series of choices that leaves them a hollowed out shell. That with the first wind topples them over. You can lead a man to water….., etc etc.How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb?One….but the lightbulb must want to change.Tend to yourself, and find someone you love, just Be with them, love them up a tish. Find gratitude in even one someone or something. You/we are not responsible for a chunk of humanity. Thinking you are responsible for Humanity can suck the life force from your bones. Or give you a Messiah complex. Which will suck the life force from your bones.

            Our people commit homicide-suicides, usually involving a spouse/loved ones. Look at gun memorial. It is a biologically white way of checking out. Almost all of the white people on that site who didn’t die from a jogger, died that way. It’s really something. That is what to watch out for. It is sad indeed. I’ve never understood the mentality of those that check out who kill the innocent or those closest to them. Makes no damn sense to me.

        Why not let Marxism seize the moment, and they roll out reparations, green deal, more++, and it collapses the world back to the 1800s, in a way that all people’s see who and what is responsible for destroying the modern era. You want those people in charge when it all collapses.

                    No I get it brother. Just a bad joke about having to go back to the 1800’s to see the (((people))) responsible without ending up on the wrong side of history. Plus a bit of skepticism whether the collapse will indict the right people in the minds of those who “voted” them in. But I do appreciate the stoicism and spiritual hardening you recommend, true words I do take to heart.

        Yawn.Hey, guys. I just woke up from a medically-induced coma after drinking some covid-cure medicine I found on the internet. So, uh … how’d the Trumpslide go? How much did we win the black vote by? A lot I bet. Probably 40 or 50%. Yeah, I bet Donald Trump is raring up to jail Hillary Clinton right about now thanks to the secret 4chan messages of Qanon. Trust the plan. Thank God I didn’t listen to all those Blackpillers who tried telling me Trump was in serious trouble. Now that we have lil pump and Kanye West on our side, we’re unbeatable. Bye facediapers and lockdowns. Thank God, too. Millions of people were on the verge of starving to death. It’s good that old people came out in masse to vote against the Covid hysteria. I’m only 25, so I don’t have anything to worry about. How am I supposed to live my life under these circumstances?

            The point he was making is that it couldn’t possibly be more corrupt. At this point I honestly believe the UN would show more integrity.  That’s not praise for the UN, but condemnation of what a circus our nation has become.Democracy in a low trust society is impossible.

            No entity could supervise, and therefore assure, a fair US election.  The current mishmash of rules preclude such observation.  And conversely, simply changing those rules back to common sense standards, typically in use 50 years or so ago would eliminate the need for such observation.

                That’s true  but thinking rules could be changed for a fix Conservatism thinking and it is the problem.The only rules that matter are “Do as I say.” now and anything that doesn’t build power for “Do as I say.” is useless.Power is all that matters now and if Trump loses in the end you can bless the Democrats every night for teaching you this valuable lesson.

                    Yup, when the rules and institutions providing limits and restraint are ripped away, all that is left is the will to power. Those with the strongest will to power are not pleasant people to be around or to live under, at all.

        The data in this article alone should be sufficient to force a recount in WI.
https://mkecitywire.com/stories/564495243-analysis-seven-milwaukee-wards-report-more-2020-presidential-votes-than-registered-voters-biden-nets-146k-votes-in-city
Apparently the voter count numbers in WI necessitated that between 700,000 and 900,000 WI voters registered to vote on election day, and that statewide turnout was approximately 90%. Both of these numbers are completely implausible. This is voter fraud on a massive scale.

Has anyone else noticed that ‘White’ is no longer a category for race on our many, many questionnaires and forms government or otherwise?   It’s Black, Asian, Pacific Islander,Hispanic or not Hispanic.I guess White isNon-Hispanic.

            They are slowly losing population. The exodus is accelerating and even immigration can’t make up for it, particularly if the economy goes down the toilet. I made sure NOT to answer the census and hope to establish residency elsewhere by the end of next year. My once solidly red city in once reliably red Orange County has elected a bunch of SJWs to the city council, mayor, state senate. CA is toast.

        […] Elections are one of those windows into the nature of a society, like the roads or public transport systems. It is a manifestation of the real nature of society. In the case of elections, it is not about the results, but about how the election is run. Orderly, well run societies have orderly, well run elections. The results are known soon after the votes are cast and no one questions them. In disorderly, low-trust societies, the vote is messy and chaotic and no one takes the results at face value. […]

        Win or lose, the rampant voter fraud the democrats have gotten away with for decades is going to jump up and bite them.  The fraudsters were and are likely being surveilled and will be prosecuted.

        Z-man, you are far, far too optimistic about what is going to happen.Biden is not Obama, or Clinton. And the Dems are not what they were. The bad thing about Trump is that he stirred them up like crazy, and they can’t come down from the anti-White hatred, the Save the Planet Utopianism, the BLM Nirvana. They don’t NEED Whites anymore. That’s the reality. They can just CHEAT.So, Robert Reich is once again yapping about Show Trials and forced labor camps. He’s not kidding. Biden’s people are talking about gas taxes to raise a gallon to $20. Beto O’Rourke is now going to be in charge of house to house searches using the military to seize any and every gun. And if they find one, the house is seized and everyone in the household goes off to a Uighur Labor camp. That’s openly discussed. Meat consumption will be banned by ultra high taxes. To save the planet.And we will have a year plus lockdown that Biden already promised. To end all small and medium sized businesses so that only Amazon and Wal Mart remain.Remember, Biden and his people (the Chinese) don’t need us, don’t need our cooperation, don’t need anything but FORCE against us (which is their entire desire anyway).So no, there will be no coming back because there will be no people. Just a Chinese continent packed with mega cities.I would advise any who can leave the country to do so. Leave and never look back.
