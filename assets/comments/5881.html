        When the educrats saw the glamour and glory that accrued to Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford for taking down a president, they had to get their institutions into the act.  The three-card Monte act that the press plays to hide the malfeasance of various Clintons and Obamas is just a bonus.

        There has always been yellow journalism. If you don’t believe me just read what Gen. William T. Sherman had to say about newspapermen. But I think the slide into what we see today really got started with the Watergate scandal. Ever since Woodward and Bernstein brought down the Nixon administration, it seems like every journalist in the profession is out after their very own Pulitzer.

        I.d argue that the average British colonial civil servant knew way more about the colonials than today’s jounos know about the dirt people.

        When I worked in newspapers, I can recall meeting one journalist who told me that she was the only person she knew in the editorial room who wasn’t trying to write a novel. It took me a long time for this to sink in, but I now understand what she really meant: their minds were either on something else or they liked fiction so much they used it in their work every day.

            In my youth I was doing canvassing work for a pol. It was volunteer stuff and a good way to meet women. I was paired up with this gorgeous gal and so I was chatting her up as best I could. The only thing she said that I remember is she wanted to be a journalist so she could make a difference. If I ran a news operation, I’d never hire anyone who wanted to make a difference. Every bloodbath in human history was started by someone trying to make a difference.

        When the French revolutionaries were cutting off the heads of the aristos, I always sympathized with the victims.  If our “cloud people” ever find themselves facing Madam Guillotine, I would want to be in the grandstand.
