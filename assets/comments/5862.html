        Re Ted Cruz’s exceptional quality: He’s only half Cuban (Spanish, broadly speaking). He’s also 3/8 Irish and 1/8 Italian. Might help explain his deviance from Yankee orthodoxy.

        One thing Upper Midwesterners are seeing is the effect of large scale non-European immigration. The Minneapolis Somali problem is well documented, but what a lot of people don’t realize is the changing demographics of many “large small towns”, especially in Minnesota. Formerly white bread towns like Worthington and Willmar have been swamped by Mexican immigration, largely at the behest of the big meat packers. (See Milford, MA for additional data) These places are not changing for the better. Perhaps Governor Dayton could sell his house and move to Worthington, to get closer to all the “New Minnesotans” he seems to cherish.

        56% of the public wants the Muslim immigration stopped, according to Pew.
44% don’t? Now I see why Obama thinks he can run with this.

            That’s a shocking poll. My guess is a mighty big chunk of that 44% has a lot of qualifications. One of those caveats is that they don’t get called a racist.

                One thing that is very noticeable over the last few years is how many people are simply lying or generally obfuscating about their voting intentions. Mainly because one side (the cult as you call it) has been actively harassing anyone who dares go against their wishes.Just look at the UK’s last election. If you were planning on voting Tory or UKIP you just didn’t say anything unless you wanted to get a earful from the nearest moonbat cultist. Nearly all the polls were looking at another coalition before the election, but come the actual night it all changed and all the pollsters looked very confused.

        “………Open borders and multiculturalism sell very well in New England as long as they are not applied locally………..”
The most liberal city in all of the USA, Cambridge, MA., would be, based solely on the color of the skin of its inhabitants (including college students) , the crown jewel of an archtype city established by the  KKK.

                IIRC there were no riots in Cambridge; they occurred in South Boston, a district of Boston that was heavily Irish-Catholic at the time.

        I’m not sure any state, outside of West Virginia, carries a worse reputation outside the South than Louisiana.
Mississippi and Alabama come to mind.

                Louisiana is a schizoid state. The north and the south are polar opposites. The north is a proud member of the bible belt while the south is a bunch of dissipated Catholics. In Shreveport they pre-empted the 1980 Miracle on Ice for the First Baptist (or Methodist) Sunday Service (I don’t remember which KTBS showed on Sundays)  while in New Orleans they sell liquor in grocery stores 24 hours a day. Without knowing a lot about Louisiana from experience it is a fools errand to make predictions about it or based on it.

                    And yet, Huey P was from north LA, and dominated south LA politics for years, and FDR and his gang feared him as a national force.
He coulda been a contenda. Instead, he was assassinated in Baton Rouge. Just in time.
