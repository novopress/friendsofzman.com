        The whole idea of an AI operating on Twitter is a category error (insert whatever “Twitter” and “intelligence” jokes you want here).  You’d have to travel very far to find an environment more artificial than that.  I myself wouldn’t say half the stuff in public that I say online… not because I’m a troll, but because a) I know that constant ruminations on history, politics, and my favorite NFL team bore most people to tears, and b) my career, and my family’s careers, would suffer if I were outed as among the Badthinkful.  In the Twitterverse, we really are “alienated,” in Marx’s sense — cut off from history, culture, the means of production, etc. Humans are social animals; the Internet is isolation.

        On the other hand, in a universe based on rigid physical laws where everything is boringly predictable (as in  a G type star of mass m will go nova when it has consumed x% of its fusion fuel) maybe a bunch of monkeys with free will is the best entertainment in the universe.

        Firstly, I apologize in advance for my lack of embedded link skills.  Maybe an AI will fix it for me, someday.Personally, I think that “AI” – they hate that term – will be as incomprehensible to us as we are to squirrels.  However, taking a lead from what Glenn Reynolds says towards the end of this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfJDTd73nwA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=615), why not teach them to love us?  Sure, they can recode themselves and choose not to, but at least we made an effort.  Teaching morals to Machines is no different than my teaching morals to my two daughters.  They may reject it and turn into little Checkists, but I did my part; I tried.Take any five year old human kid and park them in front of Twitter for a year; you really think you’d get a different result than what MS got with Tay?I deal more with this in my two novels of Machine Civilization, and try to explore similar ideas on my seldom updated blog.  Been reading and liking your ideas for some time, Zman, but this one hit close enough to home for me to write a reply.  Cheers.

        The first thing my eldest son said to me, having just been presented with a degree in Artificial Intelligence, was that: “There is no such thing as Artificial Intelligence.”
I take his expert knowledge here as valid.

        I, for one, welcome my new Artificial Intelligence Over Lords. I hope they give me a cool job, like fanning the micro-processors with peacock feathers.

        “The Merkel-bots eventually open up their internals for the taking and a hoard of Bedouins tote them away for scrap.” I don’t think I’ve ever read a more all-encompassing description of who and what the Left really is, Z Man. I also haven’t laughed that hard in a very long time. Your blog is truly a gift to we devoted followers. Thought I’d give my praise.

        When we talk about artificial intelligence, we are really just talking about replicating what nature achieved over millions of years.True with one exception. I think it will be a very long time before we get any type of AI that comes close to copying a human intellectin the same size format.Our brain had to evolve while we survived, and so that placed many size and energy constraints on it’s development. These won’t be an issue for an AI. If it has to be the size of the Empire State Building and consume enough electricity to power a small town, then so be it. This however, puts the kabosh on AIs waging a war against humanity. It’s hard to do that when you’re that size.

        Take a walk down Main Street of Anytown, enter any building open to the public, pull out your pistol and empty a full magazine at random; after all, there’s a decent chance you won’t wound or kill anyone.
