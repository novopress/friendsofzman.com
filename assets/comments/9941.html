        “Anyway, Cowen is obsessed with food and the so-called foodie culture. ”
Heartiste doesn’t refer to him as “Cheap Chalupas” for nothing …

        The Foodie Culture was actually a 1970s thing, following the 1960s when Jacque Kennedy introduced  French food to the White House.  The Chunnel was one of the most thrilling innovations to the Brits because they could now shop and eat in France.  I was married to a wine aficionado (there are few things more boring) and  had to suffer his winey pals as well.  Numbers of very classy alcoholics finally found a legit place to practice their addiction.Hippies like Alice Waters became famous for cooking.  Ditto Beard, Julia Child, and on and on. And it became hip to know who they were and drop their names.  For food writers, it was nirvana.  Masses of people who really liked to eat and not pay for it became food writers.  Wine writers.The pendulum swung and it was back to hamburgers, fried chicken, home food.  And vegetables.  But always glorified by those who write about such things.  The internet is full of bloggers obsessed with food who write for their respective cults.Here’s Tyler, in what passes for action.  Note Mr. Rogers sweater and beard to cover weak chin.  Kind of a sad sack.  I can’t imagine his ever saying anything moe pithy than “pass the croissants”.https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/business/tyler-cowen-on-how-upper-class-elites-were-the-key-to-trumps-success/2017/02/28/bcb02862-fdc2-11e6-9b78-824ccab94435_video.html

        The saddest version of this is middle-class wannabe Cloud People routinely pissing away their  income one cup at a time every morning at Starbucks.  Hey, I enjoy a good cuppa joe, but making palatable, affordable coffee at home ain’t rocket science.  But Cloud People and their followers were never great on introspection.  Or cost-benefit analysis.

            A three pound bag of Jose’s Colombian beans at Costco $12.50.  A Cuisinart burr grinder for the cheapest price available (retail $50 and worth it.  Can be found for less.).  A Cuisinart coffeemaker (best price at Best Buy with coupon).
This coffee is delicious and brings raves.

        1. This food culture also happened in the decline of Rome. There are old Roman villas with aquariums where they raised exotic fish, and letters describing the same obsessions with foods we see today. The same kinds of health oddities, too. Cicero writes of Julius Caesar coming to his villa in Tusculum for dinner, bringing two thousand troops with him, and describing a new diet wherein he uses emetics.2. The narcissism we see in our culture has been repeated over and over through the centuries. It usually comes about after some great landfall in wealth gained by those in power or close to it, largely unearned wealth. In our case it came from the devastation of the industrial capacity of the rest of the world, which had to recover after two great world wars. This is the wealth that the boomer generation lived off of, and which their kids are disappointed not to have in patrimony.One other form that the wealth windfall can take place is by transfers, or being close to a part of an economy that benefits from a new trade. In ancient Greece think of the booty of the Persian wars followed up by looting the treasury at Delos. The people close to Mugabe getting rich off of the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe (I know that to a lot of people this sounds counterintuitive, but when you are among the first to touch inflated money, it is like counterfeiting, you get so egging for nothing. If you can invest your gains wisely, you get rich, like with a hotel in Zurich) is another example of a transfer, and despite the fact that they come from an impoverished country, they are part of the cloud.

        The other thing about food (sorry if someone above already said this) is that it’s one of the only things that can be discussed in the Cloud.  For example, if you go to India, you’re not allowed to comment on the squalor of it and the indifference of its people towards those in a lower caste. “The FOOD WAS WONDERFUL!” is the only remark you are allowed to make.  Cloud people frequently talk about the quality of coffee and food in polite company.I completely agree with your larger point though.  CLoud people lack a culture, a history, and a family so they talk about the only thing they have.  It would also be impolite for them to talk about the new car they just bought.

            Bringing up designated shitting streets in India or deep fried live dog in China makes whitey feel bad &amp; might force them to take a critical look at these cultures.Much preferable to sing praiseful hymns to the great god of food Dieversity.I hadn’t really thought about how my lack of interest or downright distaste of “exotic” foods also falls in line with my political &amp; cultural views, tbh. I own an international trade business,but I hate to travel outside the US, don’t enjoy the “local culture,” particularly.I do, however, make a mean pot roast, casserole, BBQ, biscuits &amp; gravy, or.. any of  your standard pre-1965 Americana type dish, with full emphasis on my beloved Deep South fare. I love to cook them, people always seem to love to eat them.If this makes me an uninspired, jingoistic, bland purveyor of food, so be it. Tonight’s meal will feature baked ham, baked mac &amp; cheese, green beans with mushrooms &amp; homemade rolls.It won’t go to waste.

        This is related to the fact that the only benefit that the cloud people can come up with for multiculturalism is the wide variety of cuisines.

        C.S. Lewis observed this same ignorance of history in uneducated Englishmen:To us the present has always appeared as one section in a huge continuous process. In [the uneducated man’s] mind the present occupies almost the whole field of vision. Beyond it, isolated from it, and quite unimportant, is something called “the old days”– a small, comic jungle in which highwaymen, Queen Elizabeth, knights-in-armour, etc. wander about. Then (strangest of all) beyond the old days come a picture of “primitive man.” He is “science,” not “history,” and is therefore felt to be much more real that the old days. In other words, the prehistoric is much more believed in than the historic.

        Maybe you shouldn’t assume what a writer like Cowen is TRYING to do. If he can’t get it across to the reader, maybe he isn’t a very good writer.  People read things into the written word that aren’t there. I’m sure if you told Melville that his great White Whale was symbolic of fill-in-the-blank, he’d probably say, “The dickens you say. I wish I had thought of that! I was just trying to write a story with a beginning, middle, and end.”Food is currently a fad. I wonder how many more minutes the glut of food shows on TV have to go until they reach their 15 minutes. I also believe that pretty soon, the only argument the left will have against race realism will be food. “You don’t want illegal immigrants? Without Mexicans, we can’t have Mexican food! How can you be so racist?”

        TC is an idiot, and his analysis is banal, but for once he has actually noticed something:  the obsessive status signaling of “foodie” culture now occupies an outsize place in 21st century affluent America, while popular music’s importance in the wider culture has diminished significantly.  The two may be related, but not in the way that Cowen thinks.The popular music of the latter half of the 20th century was created by young people, mostly young men.  Young men don’t channel their energy and creativity into musical expression these days.  The reasons are various, but foremost would be the social changes which now operate to systematically neuter male endeavor, mostly of white males.  This also relates as to why popular music today, such as it is, is dominated by blacks and black musical forms.Foodie-ism, on the other hand, is the perfect vehicle to express the tastes, literally, of the managerial elite:  it’s androgynous; it “celebrates diversity;” it allows for the display of wealth through travel and dining out – but not too ostentatiously; its hedonistic worldliness and connoisseurship signals to the educated elite (Cowen’s Senegalese stew is a good example); and, contrary to Cowen’s assertion, it is highly political in that the emphasis on “organic” products, “farm-to-table” restaurants virtue signal that the espouser of such enlightened notions is a good thinker of leftist, utopian leanings – and easily distinguished from bad whites who are gmo-gobbling Fritos-eaters.  One only has to set foot in a Whole Foods to be immersed in the social and economic exclusions of the cloud people, which they characteristically and self-servingly ennoble as a kind of progressive idealism – the notion that the satisfaction of their appetites is building a better world.

        “So-called foodie culture is interesting in that it is not really a culture. It is the result of lack of culture.”
Yup. Everybody eats. It’s basic. It’ll be funny to watch as every dish gets a tag of ‘cultural appropriation’ on it. I’ll get the popcorn!

            I would watch Alton Brown’s food game show on occasion. The setup was contestant would get saddled with weird/unpleasant ingredients, along with sabotages like having to use only one hand while cooking. The contestant would then have to make the same dish, usually something simple. A celebrity judge would then evaluate their creations. Rarely did the judge notice that the ingredients were something like spam or cheese from a can.
The reality is, the human palette is not that sensitive or discerning. The most important things are smell, appearance and the proper amount of salt. Otherwise, the rest is show.

                I found that show unwatchable, because I could not get past the idea that the host was the kind of guy who would enjoy pulling the wings off of live butterflies, or aiming his speeding car at the cat caught out in the middle of the road.  Not as some sort of schtick, but for real.  Something really creepy going on there.  The contestants, as on so many similar shows, also communicated the idea that success or failure in arbitrary tests, with few or no objective measures by which to judge, was life changing to them.  I always admired the contestants who simply communicated some version of “see ya around” when they got voted off the island.  They knew they were mere pawns in a media ratings and advertising sales game, and elected to participate at a minimum level of emotional involvement–sort of a knowing wink to the audience.  I’m sure the auditions tried to weed out those sorts, and get the emotionally involved types on board.

                    “I’m doing this to prove that cooks form [name of location] can hang with the professionals.” Or, “I’m doing this to show that [a demo that is not white male] can cook like a pro!” The absolute need to feel oppressed is disgusting to me. Every contestant wen through a casting process and there were there to have fun and get on TV. Why is that not good enough?I generally enjoyed the show simply because Alton Brown is the repudiation of all cooking shows and celebrity chefs. I’ve always suspect that it is his real purpose in doing cooking shows. To show it is all fake.

                        Mrs. Dutch used to watch the Runway show with the clothes. Every contestant seemed to live under a bridge and was troubled and gay, and was some sort of minority mongerel mix, and had always wanted to design fabulous clothes, and life would be worth living if they won the show.  Then they would be pitted against each other, sleep deprived, and encouraged to get all catty.  Way too much drama.  Heidi Klum could have physically smacked down anyone in the room, and everyone knew it.  I wish she would have now and again.

                        I think the whole reason for Alton Brown’s attending culinary school was for making his own cooking show because he thought all the others on TV at the time were garbage.  He’s actually a TV/film guy who transitioned to the culinary world instead of vice versa.  If you’re into eggnog, then Alton Brown’s “aged eggnog” is fantastic to make.

        I go the other way, sometimes just to tweak the foodies on Facebook.  My roots are Appalachian, and there is many a coal miner and hillbilly in my lineage.
I wear it like a badge of honor.
So, when I or my wife make pinto beans with chow-chow and cornbread, or fried potatoes with ramps, or venison stew, I’ll post pictures on Facebook and describe what’s really good food.  Yeah, it tweaks the kale-eating foodies, which is a bonus.

            Ramps, a cat head sausage biscuit, pinto beans, weenies and peppers, a slaw and chillie dog, canned dear meat, a shopping bag of Morrells, fried green tomater’s, now those are about as provincial aspects of culture here in WV as you can get. Culture that is definitely upstream of politics.

        I agree with the article and the comments above.  I like my food and frequent several ethnic restaurants in town but don’t make a big deal over it.  It just seems silly to make that big a deal over your Pad Thai, photograph it, and share it with people not there.  One of the many reasons I don’t do social media is that I don’t care what other people are having for dinner.Anyone that starved for intellectual stimulation should be visiting art museums, exploring classical music, reading classic literature or ancient history.  I’ve met self-professed “foodies” and mentally translate the term to “vapid and shallow”.

        the cloud is a social trance. we were hypnotized into chasing the “best” music in the 70s instead of debating politics &amp; the human (or majority group) condition, or appreciating our ancestor’s accomplishments &amp; trying to add to them. (((somehow))) it all became very narcissistic &amp; trance like (“look over here – entertainment! food!”) now that things aren’t so good, we wake from our trance.

        I have to agree, and expand on this a little: The insatiable hunger for constant novelty at any cost is an r-selected trait. They can never eat the same thing twice, visit the same city twice, sleep with the same person twice – the constant need for endless novelty at the expense of literally everything is the hallmark of such immature minds as we find ourselves being crushed under today.College students used to save money by eating ramen, rice and beans, PB&amp;J. Now they go an extra $20,000 in hole so they can try a new sushi place every night while drinking a $5.00 cup of coffee.Also the closing thought about cutting down the trees to burn – heart breaking in its poignancy. I’d say, “well done,” but it hurts too much.

        Z Man;So TC is sad that food is the new status competition arena and not pop music_?  And he’s sad that food’s not as political as he thought pop music to be_?I see what you mean about the a-hostorical nature of what passes for thought in the Cloud these days. You nail the ‘why food_?’ question.  The other question should be ‘what took so long_?’.There has always been status competition (and likely always will be).  To be a player, one must be (a little) out in front, but that gets harder and harder, (not to mention more and more costly) as the ‘signaling space’ fills up with unoriginality.   So sooner or later a few daring souls branch off into a new genre.  And those with a lot invested in the previous status signaling genre are faced with a dilemma: ‘Must I really start over_?’  If enough say no, the proposed new genre fails, so there’s some status risk entailed in being the first mover: But also the chance for 15 minutes of fame.The main difference with Boomer pop music was that there are a lot of us, hence a suddenly vast market that persisted longer than one might expect because entirely too many of us are  reluctant  to ‘put off our childish ways’.  In my youth in the ’60’s it was common knowledge in the larger culture that every generation preferred the pop music of their late teenage years to all other music as they aged.  Also that they forgot that most of it was dreck and remembered only the few good pieces by the few exceptional artists.Another difference is that The Greatest Generation completely had ruined so-called high culture music: Also art.  One could say that Cloud status signaling took such a destructive, unappealing turn in the ’60’s that low class mores became aspirational in the pop culture rather than the other way ’round, which had been the historical norm.

        Missed it by that much…The food culture and travel culture are all about beating the people around them over the head with how extra-double-plus-aware and special they are to take in all of these places and foods, and you, in your pathetic inferior lives, devoid of photos of exotic places and bellies full of strange foods, are not.  Suck on this, cultural experience inferiors…It is not about looking for strange cultures because they don’t have any culture of their own, but because it elevates them over the rest of us, in their eyes.  Bragging about the Saturday pancake breakfast is so prosaic, but eating the crunchy legs of giant beetles while in Asia is so special, and the rest of us don’t get to do it–so there!

            Indeed, and it’s mostly middle aged professional women with plenty of money but no partner or kid who do this over-the-head beating. They travel, alone or with other single women, because they have nothing else to do in their spare time.

        Everything is pitched for its hipness factor. The competition to be hip is eventually going to drive hipness lovers (most of the population over six) crazy, literally,  as total hipness is an ever-moving target. Hipmania will however never be recognized as an official mental disorder, or even diagnosed, because no one in psychiatry wants to be labeled as unhip. New institutions will have to be built where people can walk around all day in the hippest sneakers, using the hippest cell phones, eating the hippest foods and referencing the latest pop culture hip insights. The marketing of these institutions will be built around their total hipness. Once inside, the hipmaniacs will not want to leave because, in a state of euphoric hipness, they could not imagine a better place to be.

        The same conclusion applies to travel culture as well. People go to great lengths to visit seemingly exotic places for the primary purpose of acquiring photos to display on social media. The goal is to exhibit one’s culture exposure, which, as you mention, makes the implicit assertion that one has no culture of their own.

        Well said. The Cloud people have removed themselves from objective reality and focused on their feelings and subconscious animal desires as the supreme authority to measure value by. They are discovering like Solomon of old that there is nothing new under the sun, even when they call it by some other name.So novelty, such as pursuing exotic or new variations food, is all they have to look forward too to stimulate them.They are slaves to their appetites, living to eat, instead of eating to live, as well as fornicate, and play Sim games treating the Dirt people as their toys to while away their time. They lack the work ethic to pursue more fulfilling activities that require effort and dedication. They play Guitar Hero and believe they are co-equals to Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.So like sycophants in Versailles, they amuse themselves with trifles, while confused by the complaints of the citizens that pay for their playground.
