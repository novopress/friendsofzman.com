        Man, the Trump administration is one big hoot, isn’t it?  I’ve been grinning like an idiot for months.  What the hell did you people think was going to happen?!?  Congrats, “””Progressives,””” you’ve reduced the word “racist” and all its cognates to “I admit I just lost the argument.”  Good show.

        I laugh when the “diversified” work area I am subjected to, has one of the group talk about white supremacists and the Klan as if this was the early 1900’s.   BLM makes the Klan look like a bunch of beta male sissies today.   One fellow talking about how he was in S. Carolina a few years ago and the Klan was running rampant down there.  Asked how he knew this,  did he see a bunch of guys running around in the sheets?   He said no,  he never saw anything,  but you know its rampant,  its just hidden.    I did a google search for Klan related crimes, found nothing and said if the Klan is running rampant down there,  they are doing a piss poor job of terror and promoting themselves.  The retort to me?  “You’re just ignorant.”  LOL

            Twenty years ago, I was in West Virginia. I fell into conversation with a good old boy who was probably late-40’s or early-50’s at the time, so he is an old man now. He mentioned that he was in the Klan 20 years ago, before his kids were born. He quit when he started having kids because he said, “All we did was sit around drinking and playing cards. My wife would no put up with it.”
The only place the Klan exists today is in the imagination of lunatics.

                Actually, a good percentage of members of the Klan today are informants. Its funny actually. I picture a bust of a small group of klansmen and the majority of the people holding guns and badges are infiltrators.You did not mention the difference between the Klan in Reconstruction, the 1920’s and today. The Klan in the South after 1866 was actually one of the few groups that dealt with Southern Whites’ problems. They were similar in that regard to the early mafia, in that they were local and provided protection and “justice” for those outside the power structure. It only lasted until into the 1870’s, by which time Southern Whites had recaptured control of their local and State governments. The 2nd Klan was organized about 1915, lasted longer, and was primarily outside of the South. It had millions of members and had more of an anti-Catholic and anti-jewish leaning. Being anti-jewish meant they were going to be toppled soon, and they had pretty much disappeared by the 1940’s. The 3rd wave was Southern and was in response to the forceable imposition of blacks into White society, schools, and the political process.The Klan of today has maybe 3 to 5,000 members. It is a joke. I do not doubt their beliefs, but that such an insignificant number of people can be labeled as a force of “evil” to be reckoned with is just part of the divide and conquer dialectic.

                    Yeah, the Klan only exists in the fevered imagination of Progressives. It’s why that “reality” show on the “modern Klan” ended up hiring actors. If you could find 1000 people to pretend they are in the Klan I’d be surprised.The real Klan was really three different iterations. The Reconstruction version started out as a drinking club for ex-soldiers. It then morphed into a political force. Then it petered out after a generation. The second Klan in the beginning of the 20th century was mostly a reaction to the changes brought on by industrialization and the South finally recovering from the war. The mid-century Klan was a different thing entirely and mostly a response to the changes post-war.Regardless, it’s all ancient history at the point.

                        An episode of NPR’s “This American Life” exists which is illustrative of at least one extreme tactic jews use maintain fear and group cohesion within their ranks.  The episode focused on summer camps; in this instance jewish summer camp.The subject recalled an assembly where camp councilors were lecturing the campers on jewish identity and the dangers of the goyim. A man in full Klan gear rode up on horseback and snatched the interviewee from the crowd – to the screams of horror of the crowd, then rode off into the Borscht Belt woods.  When out of ear shot she heard a familiar voice under the hood telling her to calm down.If the Klan did not exist, the tribe would have to invent it.“Loxism is a real thing” – FBI Anon

            “I did a google search for Klan related crimes, found nothing and said if the Klan is running rampant down there…”
You do live in a bubble, because the search “klan related crimes in south carolina” reveals KKK operations there who are rampant in the state regarding their operations there.

                @anti-Gonstic – Outside of the Dylan Roof shooting headline at the top of the search “klan related crimes in south carolina”  there is squat there.  The next item on the list is “12 Horrific Crimes…..”  did you bother to read the article,  or are you the typical regressive low-info person who only reads the headlines and not the article?  The article covered the 12 worst crimes going back to 1921 and most of them were outside S. Carolina.  #3 on the list was the “Trials &amp; Tribulations of the KKK in S.C.” which covered the years 1871-1875.   The rest of the page is just random articles covering a wide range of issues.Oh the SPLC lists KKK as a hate group in SC link?  Big fing deal.  Where are the links of news stories with the KKK burning, killing, raping, looting and all the crime they have been committing over the past 30 years?   You’re just like the guy who says Christians are worse than Islamists when it comes to terrorism and the first thing out of your mouth would be Timothy McVeigh from over 20 years ago and then you drop the subject.

                Okay, I’ll bite. I googled “klan related crimes in south carolina” and found pretty much nothing.
But there wasthis gemfrom two years ago: “In the last year, four hate crimes were committed in South Carolina, including the distribution of KKK leaflets in Seneca.”
That be some scary shit. Leaflets in Seneca! Enough to make the average freshwoman at Oberlin get all light headed, I’m sure.

                    It’s an old lefty gag. They expand the definition to something to include things no sane person would include, in order to exaggerate the problem. That way, a couple of guys handing out flyers for their club can be classed as alt-right terrorism. Meanwhile, a Prog warrior gunning down a congressman is just another case of gun violence.
I really have no patience for this sort of bullshit.

                        The bullshit comes from you.  The Reconstruction version of the KKK was in direct relation to blacks receiving the the right to vote.  President Grant took them out.  The 1920’s version was anti-Jew, anti-Catholic, anti-immigration, anti-alcohol.  Internal problems took them out.  The 1950’s version was a result of the removal of Jim Crow segregation from southern life.  Furthermore, if white people in the South sought to interact with black people and were legally and socially prohibited, then there was a clear violation of freedom of association.  Your hypocrisy is revealed.

                I saw the SPLC magazine in a police office too.  In 6 months of issues, two mentions of tiny, Islamic flavored gangs.
This at a time when alShabaa had 24 camps and had bought a defunct Boy Scout camp in Iowa; Jamaat al Fuqra had 69 training camps operating.  Golly knows how many more, with 8000 Sunni mosques open by then.  (2004-ish)

        At the very top of the modern hierarchy of sin is the sin of antisemitism. It’s the one unforgivable transgression.
The rise to prominence of Linda Sarsour might suggest that Islamaphobia has edged out antisemitism. It’s certainly headed in that direction, and in the UK it’s way ahead. See the definitions of Islamaphobia according to the Met policehere.

            Agree.  Anti-semitism seems to be the new “in” thing.  Certainly if you judge by the reports from my kids in college.  It’s just cloaked under “anti-Zionism”.

                Can confirm.  They’ll give you some boilerplate about the Palestinians, of course, but it’s obvious their hearts aren’t really in it.  Antisemitism is rapidly becoming the hot new hate on campus.  Which makes sense, I suppose — if you’re gonna decry “privilege,” there’s no more privileged group in America.

                    Honkies often confuse anti-Zionism, anti-Israel and anti-Semitism. Progressive Jews are very often anti-Zionists. They think nationalism of all stripes is illegitimate. Then you have Progs who are pro-Palestinian, so they are anti-Israel, but they are fanatically opposed to anti-Semitism.
There is a slow convergence on the Left as it becomes less white, but there are still plenty of Jewish liberals who oppose Israel or Zionism, but are sure everyone on the Right is a fan of Hitler too.

                            Good on Z for noting the differing factions.  Israel itself is halved by socialist lunatics, with plenty of government gangsters.
Herzl’s 1870 ‘Zionism’- save your pennies to buy Jerusalem back- was replaced by Red Labor Party Socialist neo-“Zionism” in 1931, conquest by any means or mask necessary.  Those masks can be either left or right- again, any means necessary.  Traitors.

        The weirdest thing about the Left’s obsession with the Klan is that, if you have even the most basic grasp of math (like third grade math) the fear-mongering about the KKK is a transparent joke. The KKK at its most powerful, back when congressmen and businessmen still held ranks like “exalted cyclops” or “grand kleagle,” maybe killed a couple hundred black people in a year. Here are the numbers for murders in ONE CITY (Chicago) for one year (thus far): “Year to DateShot &amp; Killed: 369Shot &amp; Wounded: 1744Total Shot: 2113Total Homicides: 397”Neither the Klan nor the police are anywhere near as dangerous to black people as black people are. Also, ain’t it ironic that this is happening in the quintessential democratic stronghold (where our first and last black president matriculated in the racial hustle)? Trump wants to call the feds into Chicago to do something about the situation. Every white pansy and house negro like Ta Nehisi-Coates is calling it a bad idea. Every sane and rational black person who cares about black people thinks it’s a good idea.

            Only about 4,200 people were lynched in the South between 1865 and 1952. Over one fourth of the lynchees were white. The reality today is that blacks commit murder at a higher rate annually than were lynched during the entire Jim Crow period. Let that settle itself into your head.

        “Still, the thumbless way that groups like the ADL are responding to the Dissident Right suggests they have not just lost their way, but lost their relevance.”I think part of the problem is the three generation rule; first makes the money, second passes it on, third squanders it. Its also a matter of demographics. The people who are going to involve themselves in the ADL (or in ADL fundraising) are going to be more like the current head of the organization  who is a former Obama administration official. That last part, “former Obama administration” is probably the most important part in why the organization is going the way it is with the speed it is.You’d think an organization that is supposed to deal with anti-semitism would be even mildly interested in the the leftist third world unrest going on American campuses but that doesn’t seem to even register on their radar. Given that its a progressive radar, that’s not exactly surprising. (And if you’re wondering what could be going through the mind of Jonathan Greenblatt, keep in mind that he’s married to an Iranian Jew which means he probably figures he can claim his kids as “people of color”. Thats a madness all of its absolute own but the idea that the people on their way up in the progressive world might not want the people currently on top to keep their seats or even think them worthy of their seats hasn’t seemed to occur to him.)

I was surprised at how fast I turned from a phile to an HBD realist once I began to question.
I’ve become rather a broken record, unfortunately.  A lifetime of emotional response blinded me to the huge gaping holes in main narratives such as ‘the Holocaust’ or ‘the Slavery Paper’.
Thank gosh for the Web.  Other large frauds, such as Global Warming or Wars on Terror, aren’t stampeding the herd very long anymore.

        Anti-black racism is a more unforgivable sin in the Progressive theology than anti-Semitism. That’s why “ni@@er” is the most horrible taboo word in the English language (except when blacks say it). Way worse than “k1ke,” or “sp1c” or “f@gg0t” for that matter.
Morris Dees the “Hebrew Avenger” is not a Jewboy and was raised Baptist. It is true that he was named, via his father Morris Sr., after a Jewish friend of his grandfather, hence having a first name that was popular among Jewish men of his generation.

        Not too sure antisemitism is an unforgivable transgression.  It’s always been an element of Leftist ideology, albeit not particularly emphasized.  Given the current Leftists infatuation with radical Islam, I think it’s now an “in” thing for the feral humans.

        I turned myself into Obama’s Attack Watch. I didn’t even get a lousy “Certified Liar About Obama” t-shirt. Now you’re telling me it’s too late to turn myself into the SPLC for a “Certified Hater” t-shirt? Life sucks.

        “The truth is something different. The primary role of the Klan was to keep whites in line, not blacks.”You were asleep in American history class.  The primary role of the KKK was to purify American society through white supremacy and white nationalism.  Violence was a key instrument against whites and blacks who dared to cross them.“Sure, the Klan would terrorize blacks on occasion, but they were mostly interested in keeping the white majority in line.”First, it was more than “an occasion”.  Second, apparently you are opposed to freedom of association.  Southern whites who preferred to deal with blacks economically and socially have that liberty; they should not have been shamed, at best, or hung, at worst, merely for choosing to befriend them.  The KKK it would appear was opposed to freedom of association.  Moreover, the KKK still maintains credibility, as they have the power to recruit.  David Duke is an example of the KKK’s continued presence in our society.

            You are talking out your ass here. Mostly likely because that’s where you keep your head.
Your reading comprehension is below average to boot.
I suggest you get someone with a three digit IQ to explain this stuff you you so you can stop making a giant ass of yourself in the comment section.

                That’s what pissed me off. I’ve written a lot about free association and private discrimination. I don’t care if people call me names. Just get the names right.

            David Duke is only relevant on a national scale when the media has to slander a Republican during Presidential election time. Otherwise nobody says or hears a peep from him other than perhaps local politics.   Like the silliness of the press trying to get Trump to denounce Duke because Duke supported him for President.   To simpletons,  that is a sign that Trump has to be a racist because a racist supports him.  If Duke had supported Hillary,  it would have been treated as a nothing burger because Duke is irrelevant.  Hey the Communist Party USA and other Communist political outfits in this country openly supported Hillary.   Was she ever asked to denounce communism?

                Up until about 18 months ago, David Duke was living in a hut in the Ukraine. Somehow he made his way back and has been trying to attach himself to the alt-right, but I think they consider him a museum piece, at best.

                    If Timothy McVeigh, Dylan Roof and David Duke didn’t exist, the left would need to invent them.  How many hundreds on the left have done the crimes or taken the edgy positions that these three represent in the last 20 years?

                        “If Timothy McVeigh, Dylan Roof and David Duke didn’t exist, the left would need to invent them.”
How do you know they didn’t?  Never discount what can be accomplished with $Trillions of un-accounted-for dollars.  I am of the opinion that damned near every reportable thing which happens in the public eye is part of a show, with a script, a plot, actors, producers and directors.
