Thirty years of 1933 ruling the US has brought us to this point.

        Beautifully written essay. One thing to comment on, though:“That is probably part of Trump’s frustration. He is being treated by world leaders as a guy who lies all the time, when he is not the guy who did the lying.”My point is Trump himself is no paragon of probity. He’s talking garbage all the time — wild promises, exaggerations, misrepresentations, idle and toothless threats. Granted, it’s not the deliberate and malevolent lying of previous presidents. But the impression it creates on the rest of the world is similar: this is a fellow whose word cannot be trusted, who is not reliable, who does not know what he’s talking about. For a recent example look at his criticism of Putin for his strikes on Ukraine, which shows either ignorance or deliberate omission of the fact that the strikes have been retaliation for Ukraine’s drone attacks. Which portrays Trump as either an ignoramus or a liar.In the best of circumstances diplomacy requires patience. But this hold particularly when you’re in a weak position like the USA. The Russians have patience. And implacability.

                    Agreed. The loose cannon is just a variation of the ‘good cop/bad cop’ routine. And it can be surprisingly effective. I have never been impressed with the Dr. Jekyll/Mr/ Hyde routine and would respond to it exatcly the way Putler did and call the bluff. Trump should have been prepared for this…
I think there are still too many jews and neocons in Blumpf’s orbit giving him really, REALLY bad advice and intel…

                            Many did during Trump’s first term. Then later they got assassinated or a huge effort to jail them began if they refused to be removed willingly. There was real hope there for a little while that America had changed course.

                    Here’s a deal Trump could offer that would end the war very satisfactorily: Offer Zelensky asylum, on the condition that Z tell all about the many crooks who got him where he is.What Ukrainian would / could take over the mess? Does it matter for our purposes? – embarrassing a lot of the worst leftist crooks.Zelensky is an narcissistic entertainer who should have a legitimate grudge against the Dbag, NATO, Eurocrat, crooks. Even if he doesn’t rat out his “buddies” (police tactic 101), it’d be funnier than hell watching them crap their skirts(suddenly, Z would become totally untrustworthy – to them and the news media). But Trump’s a great persuader…The real enemy that needs to lose that war is the evil scum from Hunter Biden on up who have killed at least a million there to fatten their bank accounts. Z is just a coke and ego addled chump they used.

                Trump’s loose cannon approach to policy succeeds on the domestic side, but falls short on the international side. I mean, bless his heart, but he seems to think that America still calls the shots globally, like it’s 1991.I support the Donald on his domestic initiatives, but his foreign “policy” shows that he doesn’t do his homework. I had hoped that with his re-election the entire focus of his presidency would be on cleaning house here, drawing the USA away from its interminable “foreign entanglements”, reviving industry, etc. Alas, it is starting to look like our ADHD president will lose himself and his last years in bloviation and diplomatic folly. He should be spendingallhis precious time in power fighting the Swamp*, pushing for real spending reduction, in short, doing the stuff that his millions of supporters hope for. At a guess, not 1 in ten Trump supporters voted for him in order to settle the Ukraine war, keep Iran from going nuclear, or “mediate” a settlement of the Israel/Gaza soap opera.*The same Swamp which tried to impeach, imprison, bankrupt and kill him. I would have applauded Trump even if he used his term in officeexclusivelyto hunt down and destroy his enemies. Sadly, our Donald – our “Orange Hitler” – doesn’t roll like that.

                    It’s like the first Hundred Days were fan service. Now, it’s “The big, beautiful Bill” and I am getting nervous, seeing the “national” “debt” soar to yet new heights, while DJT flails – without result – at being some kind of international broker of deals.
Trump is in a kinda sorta way our Charles de Gaulle: the last of his nation’s leaders who saw himself as leading a great and important nation, but a nation which in fact was in severe and irreversible decline.

Republicans never change, whatever the first 100 days was is over, now it’s back to the same shit from the first term. At least our oligarch overlords will get another tax cut as the country decays into ruin.

            My old company had a list of “acceptable, but less than good” real estate borrowers for our underwriting.
Trump was on that list.
He was on that list because he was a strong credit, had good properties and followed the terms of an agreement…but almost put the asset in bankruptcy if things went sideways.
It was never personal: just the way he did business.

            Trump has done his fair share of lying and double dealing, as his unilateral revoking of the Iran Treaty and some of his building deals have revealed…But in general, he is reasonably honest, but surrounded by neocons who are totally dishonest, like Gen Kellogg…That’s why none of these peace negotiations ever had a chance, and the Russians knew that…Putin is a good politician, so he goes along with these farcical peace overtures in order to be seen as reasonable by the BRICS people…But Trump unfortunately has no governor on his mouth, and continually harms his own position…Calling Putin crazy, apparently uninformed that Ukraine had attempted to assassinate him with a drone swarm, makes a very poor impression…Martin Armstrong’s AI now has Ukraine completely flatlining in the next year or two, and that is where this is going….

            I wonder if the recent erratic verbal spewing is maybe age-related. It seems to have gotten worse and more unhinged (Putin is CRAZY) for example. He’s still light years better than Biden but he’s going to talk his way into war with that stuff and the Euros and neos are going to be right behind him egging him on.

                I have noted that there is more stuff on X recently about Trump’s mental state by the usual suspects. I typically don’t trust that stuff but Trump is no Spring chicken so there might be something to it.

                If you watch him being interviewed decades ago, when he was young, he comes across as reasonable and measured in his speech. So age definitely has something to do with it. He’s still in much better shape than that senile old coot Biden.Age gets us all.

            Trump’s bluster and blow is part of the public act.  It’s a show.  I met him briefly in person, and I read may accounts of people who know him privately or work closely with him and he is a different cat.
I rather like the bluster and blow and how it fans the flames of the dopes who take it seriously.  But you are probably right, Arshad:  The dopes who run Europe probably take the show for real.  I mean, they think the tranny thing is serious, so we are talking about the most gullible fools on the planet.

                This is what I was going to say but I’ll give the examples of the “Canada as 51st State” and the idea of taking over Greenland. I don’t think he’s serious about either but it serves the purpose of trolling his enemies and getting them to say and do stupid things while also indicating the general direction of his thoughts. In this case, it probably a way to signal to the Canadians and Danes that they need to back away from their crazy “green” religion and start living in the real world where prosperity and stability requires stable and reliable energy and other natural resources which both Canada and Greenland have in abundance.I think Trump learned this style of operating doing his real estate deals. One can argue that being a troll is not the right approach to take in global politics but that’s how Trump rolls. Musk has learned from him and a lot of his antics are also pure trollery like his Roman salute, which I found hilarious because of its predictable effect of getting the shitlibs shitting their diapers and completely loosing their tiny little minds all over the internet.

            And you can bet there are people in our own government who hope to use Ukraine as the way to take Trump down, even if it means nuclear war. Hell, they’d probably love to blame it on Trump as the end of their ‘get Trump’ storyline thinking they will write the history and can finally make Trump into the new Hitler for a hundred years to those who survive. So, I give him some sympathy there. It’s a shame it distracts from helping America get back on its feet.

            Yeah, you can imagine the disbelief in Moscow when Trump said he would have ended the Ukraine war in 24 hours… and if the Russians had been just waiting to take his orders the whole time.
He truly does have a completely overblown ego. Self-confidence is one thing, but I’d be surprised if there was ever a millisecond of Trump’s existence in which he wondered if he wasn’t really the center of the universe.

        Trump’s bravado got the best of him in regard to Ukraine. America has a very weak hand. It faces a lot of challenges internally that it won’t even openly discuss. All of its major politicians are bought by a useless ally and make regular trips to undertake rituals of humiliation and fealty groveling and kissing ancient walls that Rome once crushed.The position is very weak. I mean, its most recent DHS Secretary openly facilitated an invasion and the drug cartelization of the country with mass coordinated population resettlement program. Americans sit here in oblivion while adult statesmen in China Russia … … look at what treasonous vipers are doing to destroy this country. It must be astounding to read their internal reports. They must themselves by flabbergasted at how depraved and compromised this operation is.It is time to look inward and find the resolve and the iron will to solve the many problems this country has.

            You would have to ask those rulers how they themselves would solve the problems in the US you describe. The answer is: it cannot be done with the population that exists at this time in the US. They would not stomach it — emphasis on “stomach,” because as in Shakespeare’sCoriolanus, the people are nothing but a stomach, and their appetites must be satiated. Only a leader with an iron will could accomplish it, and it would require a state of exception and open suspension of the laws for years while it was done. It would require a wholesale cultural education of the people as well to wean them from their electronic companions which have turned them into angry, aggressive, amoral zombies. That’s simply not going to happen. No such person exists, and if they do, they’re in a mountain cabin somewhere far away from all of this, because who would give their lives for this pile of excrement?

                The population to do it still exists. The problem is the civilization they are trying to protect is vapor. It is ideas. Clinging to ideas that don’t work and are doomed because of populations that do not care about them.Once someone with power is willing to wield it and willing to do as you described then a significant population of people would stand behind it.Will that happen? Muh principles and muh constitution have a very strong grip, but it doesn’t hold it on younger cohorts on both sides. One side or the other is going to go there. It is just a matter of time.

                Angry, aggressive, amoral–yet passive at the same time, thus the electric companions–which must include those f***ing escooters, that favorite form of transit for weedy hipsters. Thanks for the quote from Coriolanus, the Shakespeare play that I find most fascinating. I need to read it more, but I prefer candid theatrical dialogue as conceived by David Mamet to the Bard’s iambic pentameter or whatever they call it. Rhetorical quicksand might be an apt description.

                Correct. Too few people remember that our leaders emerge from the existing culture. And that culture is sh1t. Trump was the last chance for one man to turn things around and at least give the Empire a bit of breathing space. He is failing. that leaves only the “collapse and rebuild” option.

                We’re in the lawless exceptional state now, openly since 2020. The power to declare it wasn’t one man’s, but a class’s: “judges,” we could say, understanding that it’s not judges. It’s all their friends too.(They expected us to say it’s judges, so in 2019 they declared the term “kritarchy”—and noticing that we’re soaking in it—antisemitic.)Trump can’t make war deals because he’s not in command of the military. Everyone knows it, doesn’t say it, and acts accordingly.Actually they do say it, but we pretend they don’t. They’re not smart enough to have expected that, hence the propaganda and censorship overkill.“But that’s over now…”Did you know that the coming state-sanctioned slaughter of whites in South Africa will be caused by Trump’sslashingof USAID? I learned that from French TV today. “Elon’s revenge,” they called it (in French), the white assault on Their Democracy—andwhatever happensis a righteous defense.They’re test-marketing that. We’re paying for it.

                    The United States has been utterly lawless for far longer than 2020, but otherwise, yes. As for the here and now, compare and contrast Americans flooding into Ukraine to fight for Our Democracy with what happens to any whites who aid and assist their South African brothers and sisters.

        The US is schizophrenic. The left is honing knives for when they come back into power and cancel every executive order. Not saying they will but no legislation can or will pass,  I know big beautiful bill whatever, we just have ever widened ideologues competing for the same spot. Only a madman would make a deal with us.And it is shocking how little Trump knows about the Russia Ukraine war since it seems many of the same people that saw Covid clearly from the beginning also saw this clearly from the beginning. We are not in some murky fog where things will only be visible from a great distance in the future, it is possible to see now.

            Once the BBB gets through the Senate it will literally be the extension of the TCJA of 2017 and no more. Actually, maybe a little more – they will replace the border funding in the BBB with Ukraine funding.
It is telling that eight years later, Trump still can only get an effing tax bill through Congress. It really shows you whose side the GOP is on.

                        The GOP worked with the Brandon cabal to get his dopey POS printed money bills passed, let’s remember. But when it comes to a Republican wanting to pass legislation, they become supposed fiscal hawks, but only for stuff that affects poor people and veterans, not anything that affects the deep state, or the military, or rich people.Trump has always been 100% consistent and insistent that these programs not get touched. It’s the GOP playing their role as the loser party that puts this stuff in. From the GOP’s POV, all the negative blowback from it lands on Trump even if he desires the exact opposite of what they do, and best case scenario for them, it tanks the bill.It’s just crazy how little has changed. It shows without a doubt just what the GOP thinks of this guy, in spite, or because, of the fact that he wins elections and they don’t. I keep thinking back to Nikki Haley making that sudden pivot to attend the RNC right before Butler PA…

        The usual suspects – a talented people in so many ways – really are awful at running things. They’re naturally schemers, not statesman. Once they fully took over foreign policy in the mid 1990s, the country no longer had any real long-term strategy, at least not for the US.First, they raped Russia. Then it was war on the Middle East to help Israel and, hopefully, box in Russia. With no real past in China or exaggerated pogrom stories, they just left it alone, occasionally trying weasel their way into the CCP apparatus, but the Chinese brushed them aside.Other than that, the usual suspect did what they love to do: meddle in other people’s affairs. To what point? Install leaders who will sell their country’s soul to int’l banking to enrich themselves. But the world has wised up to their ways and are shutting them down.All of this, of course, led us to this point. No one in the world trusts us because we’ve been run by conmen for 30 years. But the con no longer works. We no longer have the economic or military ability to push people around or the trust to trick them.The world is closing the book on the 20th Century, which was also the Jewish Century.

                The other problem is that it’s not really in the Jews’ best interest either. Completely lacking any self-awareness, it never dawned on them that ruining white nations – to which they are uniquely bred to live among and prosper – maybe wasn’t the best idea.They never asked the question: Where next? Asians are far too ethnocentric and distrustful to ever accept Jews into their society. Indians are just dumber Jews so that doesn’t work. The Middle East isn’t going to work. Africa is, well, Africa. South America is too poor and run a bit like Medieval Europe, i.e. strongmen who can kill them if needed. That leaves Europe and the US.The Jews committed the cardinal sin: they shit where they live.

                    Citizen of a Silly Country:“South America is too poor and run a bit like Medieval Europe”By and large, Central &amp; South America are run by Crypto-Sephardic J00z.Every once in a while, a Catholic, such Pinochet, can emerge very briefly, but long term, it’s simplyCrypto-Sephardic J00z.There’s a reason that Lev Davidovich Bronstein fled to Mexico, where he found succor.It’s the very same reason that Lee Harvey Oswald was required to spend time in the Mexican Embassy, prior to assassinating JFK.It’s also the very same reason why Mexico has the “Presidente” which it now has:Guaran-d@mn-teed that Sheinbaum and the Castro brothers are literally kissing cousins of one another.BTW, all of this gets back to their control of the Trans-Atlantic Chattel Slave Trade industry.All of the new genealogical evidence is indicating that Christopher Columbus was himself either a Sephardic j00, or else a Shabbos Goy who was extremely closely associated with The Tribe.It’s very very difficult to misunderestimate the damage which was done to Western Civilization by the Trans-Atlantic Chattel Slave Trade Industry.Everywhere in the modern world we are still experiencing the horrifying aftermath of the j00ishTrans-Atlantic Chattel Slave Trade Industry.

                        It’s not well known here, but the Jews of Central and South America have a pogrom narrative and a demand for reparations, the return of farmlands taken from them by communists/Bolivarians/etc.
When I was a kid I sat through a couple red-versus-capitalist dinner table fights about it. Some relatives I never met were exiles from, I think, Honduras. I just wondered what they were doing there. Getting their vineyards expropriated, apparently.

                    Exactly. Jews once were much smarter, too. Always impulsive, and pumped full of grandiosity, and, again, hardly on the same intellectual plane as in the past, they thought the pivot to Asia would be for them and China would let itself be looted. You could tell when Big J realized that ain’t happenin’–poker faces are not their strong suit. So here they are, smack dab in the middle of places they flooded with violent savages who hate them as well, some of the Tribe playing matador with nuclear Russia, and left with no place to run.It was utterly predictable, actually.This tracts with today’s post because the same people yammering about Iran thought the Ukraine would be a cake walk and plunder opportunity. Trump apparently has come to his senses about Iran but the ones whispering in his ear about Russia could take him down and the rest of us out.

        The discourse around this situation has been idiotic and bizarre from day one, but even three+ years later it’s no better. I see no reason why Russia needs to stop fighting a war it is winning, especially when doing so would involve them signing a loser’s treaty with a country backed by other countries that have proven themselves to be dishonest brokers in the past. I mean, we literally have the ex-leader of one of Ukraine’s biggest backers saying on the record that they lied to Russia about a peace treaty in order to arm Ukraine. Why would Russia work with these knaves? It makes no sense. But of course our media and our foreign policy establishment is simply unable to look at things beyond their own worldview. Their behavior only makes sense in this context. The problem is the Ghost of Kiev is not coming to save them.

        Trump thinks statecraft and war are like buying a hotel or a chain of properties. He is completely over his head and so are the ideologues around him, who know little history (Rubio, Hegseth) and are already captives to a worldview that does nothing but hand over American strength and sovereignty to Israel. They believe by simply saying something that everyone on earth is obliged to listen and do as they command.They themselves have almost zero bureaucratic power (judges run Trump’s presidency, not him) domestically, and this lack of strength is, well, a lack of strength. Why a foreign leader with a military such as Russia’s would listen to the mad rantings of a dying empire’s television mouthpiece is beyond my comprehension, but I do not live in the American Fox TV bubble, where Trump is apparently re-making Eisenhower’s America as we speak.It is all a show, and Putin already told Tucker Carlson two years ago that it is impossible to make any agreements with the US, as successive administrations simply toss out prior agreements the moment they take office. We are now less than a year before the “mid-term elections” frenzy blots out the sun for six months, and which will leave the GOP with only nominal control of the Senate, and likely lose the House.If it were your country that was targeted by American regime change maniacs, you wouldn’t “cut a deal” with the “art of the deal” guy if God himself served as a notary.

            That’s exactly the problem.  Treating this like some business deal is ridiculous.  A business deal has two parties looking for mutual benefit, thus each has some leverage.  There is also a court system to (theoretically) enforce the terms of a deal.  Trump himself admitted Ukraine/US/NATO have no leverage and there is no court system to enforce anything.

        Russians have been known for centuries as unyielding negotiators. They never trade what they have for something they already have or are about to have. They always deal from their interests, never personal vanity or out of a need to get along.There is also the fact that any deal with the US is completely unreliable, as the managerial elite no longer respects laws or precedent. The folks building the Keystone Pipeline got the go-ahead under Trump, then as soon as Biden took office, all those assurances were ripped away, and they lost a fortune. You can’t run a country like that, with nobody being able to trust that the word of the current managers will be upheld under the next bunch.If Putin did make a deal with the US, he has no expectation that it will be upheld next time Democrats come into power — or even some Republican factions I could name. Plus, the US/NATO/EU have failed to uphold deals with Russia in the past, another reason they can be expected to renege.The only sensible “deal” for Russia is total victory.

        America was founded as two nations.Jamestown, the founding colony of the South was built by men who wanted to live as they always had, but in North America. This also included businessmen who wanted to make some money, like trading blacks.Plymouth Bay was founded by religious extremists seeking the purity of starting from scratch to build the city on the hill. They eventually mutated into crusaders conquering the world.  After they had conquered Jamestown-Americans.Healing the world fits easily into this vision even after the Puritan religion died out.Few Americans, not even Trump but maybe Vance, and exactly zero foreigners, realize that Trump represents Jamestown-Americans fighting to break free of the Plymouth Bay-American empire.

A situation like selling animals in the Temple, with moneylenders at their tables in front cheating worshippers, perhaps?
(To worship in the Temple, you had to exchange whatever coins for Temple shekels, thus the phrase “giving nine talents for ten.”)

Hamilton was such a shameless gangsta he wore gold lamé, and had a carriage gilded in gold-colored paint. He pimped out his ride!

                Mercantilism isn’t a bad foundation if you can’t do anything else. It at least leads to a pragmatism that benefits ordinary people. So the focus has to be on keeping the lights on, the shelves stocked with food, and the toilets from backing up. China has prospered because it allowed practical concerns like that to take precedence over Communist ideology.The stupid situations the US keeps getting into arise because its elites can never resist the temptation to use the wealth generated by the mercantilists to go on various religious crusades. Since the stated goals of these crusades (racial and social “justice”, “sustainability”, “equity”, “nation building”) are not even close to achievable in the real world it’s never too long before they take on an apocalyptic tone. The US is forever in danger of turning into Jonestown when one of its silly crusades fails to create the New Jerusalem. The fact that it still has nuclear weapons and a large military makes it a deadly threat even to those who would prefer to ignore it.

            The fascinating aspect of the Plymouth/Jamestown dichotomy is that the Puritans started out as religious lunatics, but ended up as mercantilist atheists, whereas the Jamestowners started out as mercantilists themselves, but ended up as deeply religious Christians.It was a complete inversion of their original roles in the tragedy.Two quick points:A) The Jamestown turnaround very likely had a great deal to do with the subsequent mass immigration of Scots &amp; Scots-Irish &amp; Welsh; i.e. the bloodlines of circa 1600 A.D. Virginians were likely very different than were the bloodlines ofcirca1800 A.D. Virginians.B) Goodness only knows what would have become of the Anglosphere if the jesuits had not assassinated Henry Frederick Stuart in 1612. Among other things, we would never have had to have suffered through the English Civil War.

                “Goodness only knows what would have become of the Anglosphere if the jesuits had not assassinated Henry Frederick Stuart in 1612. Among other things, we would never have had to have suffered through the English Civil War.”On a website I found (Wikipedia) it stated that Stuart probably died of typhoid fever. I can tell I’m dealing with a secular or late stage Protestant American of either bloodline (Puritan or Jamestown). They always offer a dubious/overly conspiratorial history and conclude with “Catholics messed up everything”..The reality is that the English were tearing themselves up well before Henry the VIII. Their subsequent break with the Catholicism for political/monetary reasons only added to theirpsychologicalmess*. The mere existence of Catholics/Catholicism have been giving the English a scapegoat for their problems since good old Henry. The wonder is only that the English held it together enough to have a worldwide empire and break off colonies. Someday I hope my fellow brothers and sisters by blood will be able to embrace something like the truth and sanity, because they are all related. Not necessarily become Catholics, but accept their less than perfect history with the good stuff (and that God has a say in all of this too).*The Jesuits had to hide in England to offer Mass because there was a capital punishment for doing so, particularly under Elizabeth I. But those sneaky Jesuits, sneaking around!

            Ukraine was just a periphery until Lenin transferred several major “oblast” to them in 1924: Harkov, Odessa, Nikolaev, Donbas and more. All highly industrialized, all ethnically Russian.Thats the places where it’s been forbidden to speak Russian or study Russian literature since 1991. The civil war started in these places and Putin joined the war 3 yrs ago to protect the suppressed Russian population.in my mind Putin will not stop until these Russian regions come back to Russia.

                I understand all that. My point was that Ukraine being on the periphery meant that it was still effectively part of Russia.
I look at Ukraine as analogous to Canada. Canada is essentially just like the United States, just slightly different. Once it becomes officially part of the United States, you won’t be able to tell any difference.

                    I don’t want Canada to become part of the US if it means Canadians voting in US elections. What a disaster that would be.
Look at the mess that a lot of our territories are, too. They get automatic US citizenship, and if they move to the US, they get to vote in US elections — there are more Puerto Ricans in the continental US than there are in Puerto Rico and they vote overwhelmingly Democrat, because they’re a beggar people.

                    Russian word for periphery is “okraina”. In the times of Russian empire it was called “Malorossia” (small Russia) and their official nationality was “maloros”.Thus their inferiority complex: servants for Poles for several hundred years and then “malorosi” for Russians.beware of servant who becomes a boss.

                        I grew up speaking a Slavic language. We use kraj for edge in one context. In another context, I think it refers to faraway lands. “Stari kraj,” refers to the “old country,” as used by the diaspora here in the USA. As I’m sure you know, kraj and Ukraine are both very similar words with similar meanings.

                        Ukraine (Ukraina) in Polish literally means the borderland. That’s how the territories of former Galicia-Volhynia Principality + the conquests to the east of them were referred to as in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On a side note, Ruthenian nobles from Ukraine wanted to gain status similar to Poles and Lithuanians in the country which contributed to the Cossack rebellions and rising ethnic/religious tensions.As a modern state project, Ukraine started mainly as a short-lived Austrian/Prussian creation of the Great War to establish Mitteleuropa project after the defeat of Russians and the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty with the Bolsheviks (which granted territories to Ukraine- then a German imperial protectorate) in 1918.This is also one of the reasons Ukrainian nationalism is so rabid and spiteful while suffering from a greatness mania. The Ukrainian People’s Republic’s borders (+ Bolshevik additions) are considered to be the “true” borders of Ukraine that remain under “foreign occupation” in the meantime.

        The Russians seem to have realized what much of the American right has not, which is that Trump is an unreliable bullshitter who’s only firm principle is self-aggrandizment. That tweet from RT says it all “…Trump’s message leaves little room for misinterpretation Until he posts the opposite tomorrow morning”I’m curious how long people are going to continue to trust in the 4D chess plan as the momentum of the first 60 days of Trump2 continues to grind to a halt. Trump’s top cops came out this week to tell us that in fact Jeffrey Epstein DID kill himself, so it seems clear that it will be “meet the new boss, same as the old boss” at the FBI at least.

            They have no choice but to continue to believe until January 2029. Trump is the only politician to win the presidency by saying most of the things that Republicans spent decades not saying, and crippling the careers of those who did, like Ron Paul. One cannot blame people for at last embracing someone who said what they wanted to hear, for once. It was the first, and last time, they will hear such policies proposed.That there is no chance of them occurring is simply going to take time to dawn on most, because Americans have been fed Hopium since birth when it comes to their magical political system and City on a Hill, and the idea that this is terminal is repugnant to most normal people if you bring it up in conversation. They don’t want to hear it. So, they will be made to feel it, as have stupid people throughout history who lacked the intelligence and will to take control of their affairs themselves, and instead, hired the job out to carnival barkers working for the very system they were promising to destroy.

                Normie has probably always been that way, but I’m more surprised by how many people that normally are more hardnosed have bought completely into Trump2.0’s Hope and Change.I was watching Mike Farris’ show with Kunstler and Dave Collum, and they were talking about the Epstein thing, and then later said they still expect prosecutions against the Blob. It was a real WTF moment, you guys think that the department claiming Epstein’s suicide is legit are going to be feeding useful evidence to DOJ against the people that whacked Epstein? Ok. Zman has gone pretty WWG1WGA on the subject of Trump also.I admit to having been snowed by Trump’s routine about caring about us working stiffs too, 3 times, but you can only get burned so many times before the veil should drop. The way he caved on the tariffs without getting anything of value(except to his insider trading crew), and now this stupid big beautiful bill with its 4 trillion in inflationary debt at a time when the Republicans have no answer to the veto pen, anyone who still believe the words and not the actions is a fool.If you aren’t a connected rich insider, you better be bracing for impact, and it won’t be the planned demolition I was hoping for with Liberation Day.

        Trump is a captive of the deal he made to stay out of prison. He is as much of a puppet as Biden ever was.

The only difference is Trump knows it. That’s why he’s angry. Maybe he will get angry enough to tell the tribe to fuck off, but I doubt it.

The only silver lining is that precedents are being set, perhaps intentionally, that can be used later by better men.

Harder men.

            Few will say what you just said, but it is the truth. He made a deal and people do not want to admit it. They revel in their putative self-ascribed electoral power that returned him to office, and owned “the Dems.” Everything changed the morning of October 7th for Donald Trump. He was given the choice of two jail cells, and took the more comfortable one. For this reason I would not be surprised if he is magically permitted to serve a third term, as his presence has frozen the remaining handfuls of heritage Americans in place for two more weeks after two more weeks, waiting for the Epstein Files and mass arrests as Q has told us are coming for nine years running.

        The only chance he ever had to stop the Ukrainian war was to cut the aid.  As soon as he allowed the aid to begin flowing again after the pause, the chance was over and the Russians realized he was not serious.
The real problem with Trump is and always was that he is one guy and a total outsider in DC.  His party opposes him and his policies. They do everything in their power to jam up the works.

            True.  Although the MSM spins it as financial aid approved under the prior admin, and no “new” aid is in the works.  Not sure I buy that, but we’ll see soon enough.
On the other hand, intel is just, if not more, valuable and that could have ended on the infamous Day 1.  Perhaps Trump thought intel support was the only weak card he had, and perhaps he’s right.  If he really wanted a deal, he would cut the intel and Zelensky would either sign on the dotted line Russia put in front of him or be obliterated.

ZMan writes about the “alien weirdos who gained control of foreign policy traded American respect and credibility so they could seek revenge on their ancient enemy,” yet is disdainful of antisemites.
It seems like he holds out hope that we can make some sort of peace with the chosen, which seems foolish, if we believe his own writing.

            Pardon my NAJALT, but Z has distinguished between Pale of Settlement Jews and other, more western European Jews. According to Z, our foreign policy problems largely stem from the Pale of Settlement Jews, the fruit of the Bolsheviks and the Holodomor, descendants of which are named Kristol and Kagan.
Then there are right-thinking North American Jews like Stephen Miller and Paul Gottfried and a bunch of Twitter MAGA-Semites, who hate the Kagan Kult as much as we do.

                It’s not so much NAJALT, but as you accurately recognize at least two sometimes conflicting groups exist amongst our betters.  Ones that know they have a great thing going here personally for them, and want to keep it that way.  Ones that want to harness whatever they can of this husk of the GAE to wield against their enemies.

                    Both Marko and c matt are spot on. Imagine a Stephen Miller’s talent on the other side, it makes one shudder.
Remember, this is how the whole brouhaha started amongst them.With golf clubs.
The German Jewish capitalists in Manhatten had fine golf clubs, and voted Republican. They didn’t want those low-grade Russian socialist Democrat shtetl dwellers from Brooklyn trying to crowd into their ritzy getaways.
The German, English, and French Jews had been here since the beginning and were Old Money, intermarried into the heritage population. The Russians were a bunch of noisy, lice-ridden immigrants fresh off the boat.

                I’d guess that the anti-white subgroup is at least 80% of the total group.
The chosen are famously ethnocentric.  I would hesitate to trust the pro-white subgroup to put any supposed shared values ahead of their tribal loyalty.
Remember, the neocons were accepted by the paleocons and then the neocons destroyed the paleocons.

        Mr. Trump has displayed great proficiency in his real estate business. There, he was dealing with New York bankers with whom he shared a common objective; they both wanted to make the deal. The process was imply a matter of haggling over terms. In Ukraine, Trump seems to have the opinion that President Putin shares his objective to “end the war”. He doesn’t. The war is the means by which Putin intends to achieve the objectives that he set out clearly in several comprehensive speeches he gave before Trump returned to office. For Russia, the war will be over when their objectives have been met.

            Russia also started out with the worn-out scraps of a crappy Soviet industrial base that hadn’t yet been sold off. They have a tough time exporting their raw materials due to such things as distance, transport costs, lack of shipping ports, a creaky post-mafia banking system, and the like.WWII made our worn-out, post-Depression industrial base boom. General Motors made more selling tank dynamos than cars, for instance. Russia isn’t going to be the next China or even Brazil anytime soon, so ramping up for war production means a chance to rebuild their formerly robust base, despite the lack of experienced engineers or a cohort of skilled apprentices. (Most found work elsewhere, like most of Eastern Europe.  The oligarchs took their money and fled too.)It will take time, so Putin’s best interest is to keep casualties low and rebuilding engaged.

        Respect is earned, not stolen via gamesmanship or coercion. To his credit, Trump has overcome great trials and tribulations on his journey back to the White House, and that has earned him a measure of respect from Putin. But he is not going to give away the store out of sympathy for Trump’s ongoing plight. Trump will soon bail on Ukraine; which is win for everyone. His ego is smarting because he hates losing. He will get over it and move on to other matters.

        The world is right not to trust America. Trump is sincere, but he will be gone in three years, and the idiots and crazies could be right back in power, undoing everything he did.
Since half of America is idiotic and crazy, and hates the other half and everything it says and does, the nation’s foreign policy, economic policy and trade policies cannot help but be wildly chaotic and untrustworthy.

        We are not considered the good guys anymore. I’d say our reputation around the world is basically what the USSR’s reputation was back in the 1970s and 1980s when they were running around invading Afghanistan and helping cause trouble in Central America.
I don’t think most people get this.
I wonder if the answer to get back our respect from the world is to round up the people responsible for this debacle and execute a half dozen of them, a la Lincoln assassins.

        The Russians already put it quite succinctly:“The USA&amp;co are ‘not agreement capable’.”And the Merkel&amp;Hollande comments reg.

            Stalin’s War is a good book.
Before he lost his mind, Tim Snyder made a good point about the 1938 pact: for Stalin-as-Bolshevik the only thing that mattered was the survival and extension of the Revolution.  Once this is accepted, any compromises or accommodations become a detail.

            Another book, by retired Swiss Colonel Jacques Baud, is The Russian Art of War, which is not too long but which gives a good overview of the Russian Army’s strategy and tactics as well as the post-Afghanistan TO&amp;E of the army’s units, which have been further revised in light of the fighting with the AFU. Other articles by Baud, who served as a liaison officer with NATO and UN peacekeeping units, are available online. Predictably, the Western media sniff that he is a Russian stooge. Judge for yourself.

        The US government has been a perfidious liar and troublemaker for decades now.  If the intel community can’t be reined in and a substantial number of the usual suspects (both here and abroad) removed from governmental power and influence, this country’s downward slide will continue – maybe becoming as irrelevant as the former European powers.

        As most will recall, very early in Trump 2.0, the administration decided to cut munitions to Ukraine. Republicans, neocons, democrats, the Pentagon, and our supposed ‘allied’ leaders, the media, and the purple haired-heifers down the street all went nuts, culminating in Zelensky’s temper tantrum visit.Trump gave in. The bruhaha was such that it was decided that the blame for the hold up in Ukrainian support should fall on SecDef, who supposedly acted ‘pre-emptively’. I don’t buy it, but Hegseth is a decent man, with more than enough stones to play the fall guy. Of course, the blob desperately wants his head on a pike.Even if Trump cut support for Ukraine, the underlying problem goes much deeper. Retiring a few woke generals is lipstick on a pig.

        What is the over/under on the time frame for a District Court Judge deciding that the draft must be re-instituted and sending all STRAIGHT White males ages 17-35 to Ukraine to die? I think that is where we are headed.
Europeans NEED a Ukraine War so they can send their entire White (Straight) Male population to die, to solve the “White problem.” A “terminal solution” if you will. The US leadership of Harvard, Yale, Judges, Feminists, NGOs, the media, and bureaucrats need this as well. There are too many (one is too many) White guys still around.

            If they can keep the war going, after the mid-terms. Plus, by then Trump will have talked a bunch of those people you mention into joining the military. Europe is already in a panic to deploy their fed-up white males to avoid the riots when the next tragedy occurs in their streets.

                This. Young men in the UK and throughout Europe weren’t in the least bit hesitant to pre-announce they would go to jail before submitting to a draft. In some if not most of those countries that opens someone up to the possibility to prosecution, so it isn’t bluster in many if not most cases.I don’t even think a false flag in AINO would work any longer, and if the Regime thinks a “terrorist” blowing up the Alabama capitol in Montgomery will not blow back on D.C. rather swiftly, it is deluded (which it is, but notthatdeluded). The wages of multi-culturalism is no one will defend its empire. It had to have one upside, I suppose.Throwing the border open disqualified the Regime from being defended by the people it put into danger. Again, a bit of lemonade.

        Stalin did the deal because he thought the Germans and the allies would get into a prolonged fight (WWI style) that would take the starch out of both sides and leave them ripe for a Soviet attack. The rapid German victory enraged him. The Soviets were not able to pull the trigger on their attack before the Germans beat them to it.

        Good analysis.But the thing is – Trump IS lying about the Ukraine war, over and again, all the time. He has not earned any right to be trusted – and he over and again throws away any such possibility almost daily.For example; Trump is repeatedly trying to wash his hands of the Ukr war, to deny responsibility, to claim it is Biden’s war; yet from 2016-2020 Trump’s administration was building/ training/ arming the Ukr military; and setting-up intelligence and various evil-research bases in Ukr.The Russians know all this (even if the US public do not) – and they see just another liar-puppet who is (like all the other Western leaders) thereby agreement-incapable.My impression (just that) is that the Russians have given up on the West; and that they agreed to negotiate with Trump simply to show the rest of the world (especially China) that they are being reasonable, and sticking by their earlier statements.In other words Russia regard this war with absolute seriousness and a matter of existential survival, and are engaged in a patient and long-term strategy. Trump is personally being short-termist, impatient, and is buffetted by today’s expediency.Meanwhile there are elements in DT’s administration (and those of Biden, Obama and back) that are also engaged in a long-term and relentless strategy – of destruction. This strategy is not even secret – but has been published in detail for anyone to read; and it can be observed unfolding (more or less) according to plan.The Ukr war has enabled them already to destroy the ex-nation of Ukr as a viable independent nation (vast numbers of its people, and much of its infrastructure); and greatly weaken the economies of Western Europe and elsewhere (by “sanctions”). These US-based elements also aim to destroy Russia by dismemberment, looting, and puppet takeover.Trump is, in fact, part of this plan – whether he knows it or not. He is being used to enable the US to “pivot” away from Ukr to engage in subversion and destruction elsewhere; with the UK/ Germany/ France etc taking over from the US to continue the Ukr war. This is what lies behind the puppet plays of EU and UK leaders slanging matches with Trump; the “falling-out” with the US, and the Europeans vowing (literally, in the case of the UK) to continue the Ukr war on their own.There are, however, strong interests in Western Europe (and the US and UK) who do Not want war with Russia; and so far the political leaders have not been able to achieve it.But the provocations continue and escalate.The most recent attempt (2 days ago) to assassinate Putin – this time by a massive drone swarm attack on his helicopter; was very likely done with US intelligence assistance (at any rate, it seems that this is what the Russians believe, and what the Russian believe is all that matters in this case).IF the assassination had succeeded, very probably we would by-now already be at the start of a WW III; i.e. a war that had spread to target the US, UK, and several other European nations that (i.e. the Russians believe) have been heavily engaged in sabotage and military attacks (eg Kursk) against Russian territory.The world is walking a knife edge, and has been for the past three years – and hardly anyone in the West seems aware of it.

            The one thing They fear most is a united White Colossus of the North; whether you kill the eastern half or the western half of it first, the mission is still being accomplished.
Just imagine: from Spain to the Bering Sea, with a short hop over to Alaska (and an island continent in the South Pacific)- if our peoples were united as a trade bloc or a family, 7 billion wogs against us still wouldn’t stand a chance.

        Saw it coming from a year away.  Trump’s campaign bluster about “this war wouldn’t have happened” and “I’ll settle this in a day” was just nonsense.

His followers want him to just walk away from this mess and let the Russians settle it. Maybe he’ll get there when he’s through blustering

        I have found that my European acquaintances have a fundamental misunderstanding about the structure of the United States. Most of them were shocked to discover that laws and taxes vary from state to state. Until and unless there is a treaty ratified by the Senate there is no deal. The Paris Accords are an example. No Senate, no deal. Putin has repeatedly complained that he has no one to deal with, and he doesn’t. I don’t put the blame on us, the blame rests entirely on the suckers that mistakenly believe they have a deal because a president signed it.

        Excellent essay.“Paul and I will be taking a victory lap on the Covid topic, so use the time to think about how you will congratulate us on being right about everything.”Z, you were one of the best on Covid but we should always remember that the Covid hysteria was retarded and transparently fake. All aspects of it. I am not the least bit surprised that the evil people who rule over us would cook up the hysteria, what saddened me was how so few saw through it no matter how silly and easily debunked. Facts, videos, nothing would deter most people from buying into the hysteria. There was no cruelty too great to make most rebel, especially most women.Even the Right was filled with many men who get that the government and chosen experts always lie, yet they believed the COVID lie in total or in part.

        I think the last time the GAE had to negotiate at a disadvantage was the War of 1812. There’s no institutional memory of how to do it. But there should have been some (Vietnam, Iraq) regarding the unintended consequences of reckless adventurism. They thought they had got around those problems by using other people’s cannon fodder instead of our own (Syria, Libya) but they were wrong. There really aren’t any excuses for the hubris and incompetence that led to this.However, at this point the GAE should conclude that it stands to potentially gain more, or at least lose less, by continuing the war to the last Ukrainian (or Pole, or Finn, or German) than it does by conceding anything. Because that’s the truth. Which is entirely separate from any considerations regarding the irrelevancy of all this to the AINO heritage nation and the negative effect on its welfare, which they don’t care about anyway.

        Also interesting is that there are more and more “scandals” coming out of the Biden circular firing squad. David Hogg, going Hogg Wild, has told a Project Veritas honey pot that Dr. Jill’s Chief of Staff really ran the White House, and that he was both scared of the dude and found him evil. Others are fingering Liawatha, aka Chief Fauxcohantas, as running the auto-pen for Biden. People within the Party are openly attacking the Lightworker as a failure. AOC is likely the front-runner for the nomination, on a full Gay Race Communism platform. Meanwhile the WSJ and the Murdochs are backing Kamala. Yes, Kamala.If money is the mothers milk of politics, I dont see much of it beyond the Murdochs. Trump just disrupting the flow of the grifts has seemingly put a lot people in the Party in an uproar. So there is that … as bad as the Republicans are, the Democrats are in a struggle between the Biden holdovers, the Murdochs (Kamala is aimed at preventing AOC from rising), the David Hoggs who are young and hungry grifters, AOC and the radicals, and the old guard combination of the Clinton and Obama machines.Bet on the Radicals.

        The Obama and Biden Admin kept things together by doling out money. Obama’s “shovel ready” jobs went to feminist studies professors and the like. Biden and his “build back better” (really Obama 3.0) used the same playbook and stuffed billions into Dem NGOs.Trump has lots and lots of money to dole out to others: Red state cities and counties for Harvard/Yale type money to places like Auburn or Alabama. Plus all that Golden Dome stuff, which even if it does not work will “work” just like Obama’s Shovel Ready Jobs(tm).What is remarkable is that the Houthis with help from Russia and Iran were able to force out the US Navy. Were able to either hit or near-hit the Truman to the point where it had to steam away. The US Navy no longer works as an instrument of power and the GWOT model is now dead. That means that either the US just isolates, to keep internal cohesion, or keeps trying to impose global hegemony by mass conscription and mass casaulty assaults like Ukraine. My bet is the latter, though who knows maybe Trump may bribe enough people with money to keep us out of WWIII.

        This is more related to yesterday’s post. Looks like, in response to the DC shooting last week, Trump appointed the Fox news host Ms. Pirro to AG of DC. She spoke resolutely and strongly about restoring justice and law and order and alluded to introducing harsh penalties. It was all said in context of the shooting last week.What is interesting is that even with Trump, the stimulus for such calls for justice all reach into the upper class. The consequences are spilling over into their stomping grounds. That said, he did specifically honor Lakan(sp?) Riley and the families of other victims of vicious crimes perpetrated by illegal invaders.The Regime stands at a crossroads. It can decide to fortify itself and react in response to what hits close to its home, or it can get the people on its side and move to restore justice for middle and lower middle class Americans. Perhaps this is creative. Perhaps if it can’t cut through local corruption, it can at least facilitate and support some semi-official vigilantism. That is an American tradition by the way. It isn’t new and it was very effective.In any case, there will be an onslaught of Mangione’s based on what they choose to do. The Regime on the Potomac is at a critical moment of decision. Does it fortify itself alone, or does it get the American people on its side and make meaningful reforms and take meaningful actions to protect Americans at large.This is related to today’s post in the sense that the global powers understand the crisis that America faces. They may understand way better than the American oligarchy does in fact. This is the problem with Carthage. A merchant empire can’t form a broad view of the good. The good is trade and profit. Our adversaries are civilizational men and statesmen. Putin is pressing the advantage because he has to. In 3 years Nuland and Kagan can be back in charge and he is screwed if he doesn’t.America has a weak hand everywhere that you look. The managers got their GDP numbers where they wanted them, by hook and by crook, but they burnt down massive amounts of social capital to get it. Xi, Putin, Bolsonaro, Erdogan, Netanyahu … … all understand that.The amnesty advocates in particular those who like the neocons have slithered into the Republican side, Joel Kotkin a prime example, must be defeated. One more amnesty and America has zero chance of coming back. We’ll either have factories manned by non-Americans, or a bunch of non-Americans sharing our continent undergoing extreme contraction and privation.

            “Trump appointed the Fox news host Ms. Pirro to AG of DC. She spoke resolutely and strongly about restoring justice and law and order and alluded to introducing harsh penalties.”This is one of the few things the appointee can actually do.  We have absolutely draconian sentencing laws.  Problem is, they are never enforced.  They are used as leverage to get plea bargains.  The top prosecutor in any district can fix this by making all plea deals subject to his approval.  He can just not sign off on guys who should go to prison for a long time, but won’t because of plea bargains.

            My question is, how does the son of a SEIU big shot, who was important enough to be part of the Democratic response to Trump’s State of the Union speech, and a guest of Dem Chicago Congressman, and who spent 45 minutes with Obama at Obama’s mansion, end up shooting to death a young man he did not know and a young woman he did not know, pumping bullets into her as she crawls away until she is dead. And then surrenders without incident to the police shouting “Free Palestine.”Question1: How or why does a big shot spawn end up killing two people and then immediately surrendering (does not indicate classic mental illness).Question2: How did this guy know about the event, where it was held, and who was Jewish and who was not? Redheads are not usually identified as Jewish.Question3: Why did this guy think that killing random Jews would help his cause?Question4: How did this guy identify the people he wanted to kill? How did he know they were both Jewish and worked at the Embassy?Question5: If he knew, how did he know? Did Obama provide targeting info, or someone from his staff, to the shooter’s father? Did he surveil the Embassy to identify staffers (and if so why did both Israeli and US security fail to spot him)?Question6: At the event, how did he know to be not only at an obscure place I’ve never heard of, but at the right time, to kill the victims as they exited?Question7: Why are many Democrats making this guy a hero, defending him, and defending his desire to kill Jews for Palestine? How is this a power-play winner among the elite, or public?Question8: Is this a continuation of the Obama-Ackman struggle over Harvard, if it was going to be an anti-Jewish pipeline to the SEC and DoJ to “curb” Jewish Wall Street influence, power, and money? If so will Obama be seeking to stoke the murders to the highest level and then ride in as the Lightworker 2.0 on his unicorn?Nothing about this shooting makes sense to me.

                For me the Obama vs. Ackman bit is not plausible. Obama is an actor raised up by the Pritzker/Emanuel Ilinois/Chicago political machine. He has no base of his own. He can be penniless and offed tomorrow. I can’t see any scenario that he is going toe-to-toe with any international finance oligarch.

            I wish it wasn’t so, but yes, the whole world will be Palestine before there’s any kind of pushback. Evil always appears to win, unopposed, laughing as it does so. Until, inevitably, it pushes a bit too far, and then, rather quickly, it is defeated. Doesn’t change the fact that decades if not centuries of pain are inflicted beforehand

        The long arm of American foreign policy — like the long arm of the law — comes up short when it encounters another nuclear power. The Russians like to remind everyone of this, which is why they parade missiles thru downtown Moscow. Until the Golden Dome missile defense shield is activated, Moscow will be playing from a position of strength. But the top Russians fear American engineering prowess. When it comes to killing people or not being killed by people, the rest of the world is third class compared to America. Watch for the day when enemy hypersonic missiles can be knocked from the sky with impunity. That’s the day America goes on an unrestrained rampage.

            Luckily, that day will never come. The America that could seriously think about constructing such a defense is so far gone it no longer appears in the rear view mirror. It now exists in our imagination. This is what Russian and China understand. America is a nuclear armed moron that has to be managed.

                we can’t even build a simple bridge in this country.  look at how trump still has not built a wall on the southern border.  and the parts of the wall that were built are laughably easy to get over.  we have no working hypersonic missiles, so we cannot have a defense against them.

                YouTube has changed its algorithm. A lot of blacks talking about black fatigue. The irony right? The last thing a person who is far beyond fatigue wants to see is another black shucking and jiving about black fatigue. They are also hitting hard with fancy DoD propaganda. I watched one that was about Space Force. It was very diverse and the men were very lispy in their speech. It didn’t look like something that would strike fear in the heart of an enemy.
Then again, SpaceX and BlueOrigin are probably doing the heavy lifting.

                    I am jammed up daily with pro-Israel feeds.The one that gave me pause was the One For Israel ads.Jesus is the God of the Jews!At first, I mocked it for chutzpah and manipulation, but now…The speakers are good joes. Earnest. Real. Religion isn’t my dialect, but it fulfills a deep human need in others wherein my kind of thinking is cold, with cold comfort.I’m starting to like it.  After all, Christianity started out as a Roman outreach to the urban, Aramaic-speaking Jewish citizens of the Empire.Should the Christians be able to break the hold of the Holocaust religion- from which there is no coming back, it’s either us, or them, in their minds- and find forgiveness amongst the “Never Forgive” crowd, then one could rightfully see the hand of the Christian God at work.

                Maybe, and then maybe not. The way to construct a Golden Dome is massive spacelift. Musk and Space X, check. [Space X has put into orbit about 85% of the total tonnage in the last five years, the new Starship rockets if built at the scale Musk promises, can either supply a Mars Colony or land and support a US Army division anywhere on the planet within four hours.]There is many a slip betwixt lip and cup of course. But that is the first requirement, massive and sustainable space lift. China can’t compete with us on that which is why they are complaining.The second thing is relatively efficient directed energy weapons that can hit drones at a distance in both the atmosphere from ground/sea level, and from orbit against the hypersonic missiles. As the missiles gain speed around 11-12X the speed of sound, they get a plasma around them like a re-entering orbital capsule, that absorbs radio waves. Thus both radar and jamming are ineffective. Any proposed energy weapon would have to be powerful enough to penetrate the plasma field.What this would entail, practically, is basic research into materials, batteries or energy production, possibly even small fusion reactors, directed high energy methods including lasers, X rays, and more. It is fundamentally an engineering problem.It is also an opportunity. Trump represents for up and coming people an opportunity. The Universities of Florida, Alabama, Auburn, Ole Miss, and so on would get a good chunk of research money moved from Harvard. Its patronage 101. That Musk would get even more money from Trump for Golden Dome and that the money would be spread around Red States has not escaped more thoughtful Governors and such. This is of course a Mid Term bribe. No Golden Dome and money if Dems take power, so Governors in Red States better get a GOP Congress if they want the money.The Chinese certainly think this Golden Dome is possible and not a waste of money, otherwise they would not be threatening Trump over it.

            Golden Dome is a pipe-dream and will never happen. Iron Dome works because they are defending against home made missiles made from steel sewer pipe.  ICBMs are incredibly fast (mach 20 +) and MIRVs and decoys multiply the number considerably.
MAD is the only viable solution to ICBMs coming across the Arctic.
