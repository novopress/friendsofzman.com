        Amazing how the usual suspects could claim the South African genocide claim was fake while Trump played the video with the ruling party bigwigs singing about killing the Boer.

        I don’t know what to think about Memorial Day these days. There was an elderly couple flanking the entrance to a bp near where I live in the middle of nowhere. They had little flags and he had on his “thank me for my service “ hat. Dot indians operate and staff the Bp now so they benefitted from ww2 but will never thank whites. (btw the country joggers can’t stand Indians)anyway I wanted to ask them what that war gained us, if “us” can be defined as white Americans? But I just nodded and drove off, no point in harassing them.it seems a pretty contrived abs almost Soviet holiday: a day of remembrance for the great patriotic war. Well I guess I’ll grill a little..

            I’ve been very critical, for years, of the pedestalization of the empire’s dupes (of whom I was one), and the effect this has had on the “veterans,” but that hat is a new low I haven’t yet encountered.

                I still see many old veterans here, Vietnam era now.  They often wear those hats which indicate which war, branch of service and dates.  I don’t think much of it as I can understand that their period of time in the service was most likely the high point of their life’s achievement.  I can’t get into that mindset, but I won’t belittle what pride they have in such.  Getting old ain’t for sissies.  Life’s hard enough as it is, then it’s over.  Escape back into the past has its benefits.

                    I hadn’t had enough coffee yet and I thought he meant the hat literally said “Thank Me For My Service.” But the sentiment stands.

                    My generation pokes a lot of fun at the concept. We have hats that say “Atropian War Veteran.”Atropiais one of the fictional countries that the US uses in its training exercises because somebody somewhere decided it was uncouth to be straightforward and say that we’re conducting a simulated war game against Russia, China, or some miserable third world dumpsterfire of a country.I go to the American Legion every other week or so (I only ever “deployed” toAtropiaandDonoviaand therefore cannot go to the VFW, were they have my preferred Yuengling on tap) and enjoy being around the older heads. The hats are partially a matter of pride as you suggest, but also them remembering a better past and their place in it. People tend to live in the past because the present is miserable and the future is horrifying. The Legion, and I’d imagine the VFW, are sacrosanct little pockets of a preserved time and era where these guys remember a saner country (the only exception being the TV that’s perpetually blasting modern country music videos…blech), and a lot of younger folks are put off by it. It doesn’t hold up for them because these places are a place for nostalgia and people my age can’t miss something we never experienced. They go expecting the camaraderie of service but instead find a bunch of older guys participating in a camaraderie of homesickness for an era long past who happen to be veterans. The Moose Lodges and other social clubs are mostly defunct now, so the Legion and the VFW have largely taken up the slack for that demographic.I suspect I enjoy spending time in that setting with those guys because I admire it for what it is and can appreciate longing for a time when anti-white and anti-male bigotry weren’t as brazen as they are today. I really can’t fault somebody for living in the past when the present is a mess and things look grim.

                            A long time ago Chuck Barry was one of the first celebrity sponsors of Yuengling. Even wrote a song about the brew called “My Yuengling.”

                            If you can find a Viennese style lager, it’s a lot like that. Crisp and malty with caramel notes and a hint of sweetness. They have a pretty wide distribution network including a brewery in Florida and another in Texas besides the PA one. Sam Adams Boston Lager is similar in style (and slightly better), but not nearly as affordable and the owners of Yuengling endorsed Trump in 2016 where as Jim Koch pulled out of the Boston St. Patrick’s Day parade because they wouldn’t let the sodomites have a float. It’s just called “lager” in PA and it tastes great on tap there due to the fact they don’t pasteurize their kegs.

                                Used to drink the stuff from bottles, then it started giving me wicked hangovers. This is 20+ years ago. The kegs are still great, as you say. I figure they stopped bottling it in PA.
Always favored the porter, black and tan ain’t bad, Lord Chesterfield… they made a pilsner a couple of years ago I quite enjoyed, can’t find it anymore, not that I’m looking too hard.
As a drinker, weaned on Yuengling. Good memories!

                                    Yuengling Premium was their pilsner designed to compete with the “big 3.” They also made a golden pilsner that had a little more depth in flavor. The only ones you can get out of state reliably are the traditional, the black-and-tan (a combination of their premium and their porter), their seasonal Oktoberfest, and “Flights” which is beer-flavored water designed to compete with White Claw. They made an India Pale Lager a while back that was alright as well.

                            Coors beer is what it tastes like, at least in spirit. Great when it’s the forbidden fruit. Rather average when you can get it all the time.

                        you Make an interesting point I never thought about. I suppose it does reflect nostalgia. I could be wrong but I don’t see any operation desert storm hats. I have seen those on the sides of trucks and in a stretched way, there was still some sense that America was a good place even 20 years ago. I don’t see how anyone thinks that now but I did have dinner with a family a few years ago whose 15 year old son wa need to join the military

            Every Memorial Day I think of the men who died, especially the ones who died thinking the fight was for something that it wasn’t. That said, I remember the “thank you for your service” stuff got spun up during the GWOT, and I’ve always thought it was cringe. It’s not about serving as muscle for an evil regime, even though that’s true, and the country we have now is a reflection of that. It’s because the military is, or at least was until it became a DEI enterprise, an incredible opportunity for so many who just needed an opportunity. It pointed so many millions of men in the right direction. They got a lot out of it. It wasn’t selfless service, it shouldn’t have been. Like am I obligated to thank JD Vance for his service? He went from being some weird skirt wearing dork in a downtrodden community with no prospects to VP because of his time in the military. And that’s great but he got paid for his service many times over.“Thank you for your service” always felt like latent guilt from people who sent other people to die for a war that deep down they knew was stupid and wrong and unjust.

                Since it’s become an all-volunteer force, the US military has essentially become the largest and best-equipped mercenary force on the planet. Almost everybody who joins does so for opportunity. Education benefits, a pension (even the new one is 40%), a VA-backed home loan, being able to earn money while accruing no debt (assuming you avoid the skeezy dealership selling Camaros at 30% APR just outside the gates of the base), and other benefits make the military pretty lucrative. If you’re smart, you can buy a house everywhere you get stationed at and rent it when you move so somebody else is paying your mortgage for it. Plenty of people leave at 20 with a full pension and 3 or more properties fully paid off. Military service is one of the only ways for a straight white guy to get ahead and one of the only protected classes he can belong to. With the exception of the years immediately after 9/11, nobody joins the military for abstract reasons like patriotism. The closest you get is “it’s the family profession.” Nobody says a 4th generation farmer is a patriot for continuing the tradition.

                    Yes, and the vast majority of them don’t go anywhere near combat. While watching sportsball I see ads for those “military only” credit unions and they depict grillers and people living normal middle class lives. Now, obviously, it’s an ad, but they are trying to sell to military people and wouldn’t depict something that didn’t exist.
If the military wasn’t a great deal for normal White guys post-GWOT then Obama and Brandon wouldn’t have tried to destroy it with diversity.

                        USAA and Navy Federal Credit are other great benefits for service members. I swear I’m not advertising…I left over COVID and can’t recommend any white man join an organization that would do that to somebody. COVID was the last desperate push to get rid of the enlisted and junior officers that the ripple effect of 8 years after the Obama purges couldn’t. It largely worked. Obama’s legacy is still alive and well. He purged a lot of generals. Congress picks generals, but generals, through their ratings and evaluations, pick colonels. The colonels that Obama-approved generals promoted were awful. And who did they promote to lieutenant colonel? People like them. So on and so forth down the line.The Army actually initiated a program to combat the racist patriarchy where your board file for promotion was stripped of reference to gender and race and your Department of the Army (DA) photo was not included. It resulted in white men getting promoted at extreme rates. They quietly killed that program in favor of letting the oppressed be judged “in the context of their struggles.”

                        Many of our current, so-called “Veterans”never saw battle, stayed holed up in an air-conditioned barracks in Dhahran or Manila playing video games, but they’re always ready to claim that 10% veterans discount at Home Depot, or ask for a price break at your local Walmart.I knew an annoying 40-something who volunteered to play soldier for two years at a time of peace, only to bug out with early retirement on a reduced, but still generous, pension.My gut says that, if his so-called “service” was so important, then his early leave was a shirking of his “duty,” and it would be more honest to call his departure “desertion” than “resignation.”Why he gets the same perquisites and honors that a unwitting draftee who served at a time of kinetic war does is beyond my ken.

                            The Japanese and Korean governments know damn well. A couple of Marines got rolled up last month for Rape in Okinawa. You already know what they look like. There is, of course, the “regret sex” epidemic where a woman is happy to behave like a whore (she’s mentally unbalanced to the point where she entered a man’s profession, after all), but unhappy to be thought of as one. In the Army we referred to them as “barracks bunnies” and the Marines called them “wookies” or “wooks.” There are various reported origins for the Marine version stemming from “Woman Outside Of Kitchen” to “hairy, gross, but during a deployment anything with the right equipment is a ten.”

                Vietnam looms with the “Thank you for your service” stuff.
Soldiers are supposed to follow orders and not question, so I don’t much hold them accountable. War is atrocious business. I imagine most who fight do or see unspeakable things. It’s the nature of the beast, and I imagine living with it is enough. At least that’s the impression I got from my grandfathers and vets I know.
Leadership can take the criticism and the false glory, and the rank and file can be left alone by a public that doesn’t get it (including me). IMO.

                        I was drafted in the next to last year of the lotteries and was in Vietnam ’71 to ’72.That was the era of “Vietnamization” of the war effort, which meant turning most of our equipment over to the ARVN and expecting them to do the bulk of the fighting.I was assigned to an Army depot in Da Nang and usually describe my year there as not much worse that a crappy summer camp: bad food, warm beer, and humongous mosquitos.Nothing to brag about, in other words.  I often wonder how many of my contemporaries who are still going on about their service there had similar gigs but are embellishing the facts in order to claim some attention. Since WW2 at least, the American way of war has involved an enormous logistics train and thus the majority of its veterans were REMF’s like me.  Take their stories with a huge grain of salt.

            I get sick of people who virtue signal that everybody should be somber, solemn, and possibly even miserable on Memorial Day in honor of the fallen. NPCs are going to be NPCs. To them, it’s a Monday they don’t have to show up to work and can cook out and enjoy a few beers, and I don’t really care. Getting mad at the public for lacking the decency and awareness of past generations is a pointless exercise. There are also a lot of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines who would rather remember the good things about their friends who aren’t with them anymore. And Memorial Day isn’t just about the Americans who lost their lives for “democracy” in the 20th and 21st Century. It’s also about the militia men who laid down their lives to defend their families against Indians and Confederate Soldiers who took up arms to protect their way of life.

                Ok , onto chatgdp I go to ask about the origins of Memorial Day. My guess post ww1 at least if not ww2:wow, it’s worse than I thought:Memorial Day originated in the United States as a way to honor and remember military personnel who died in service to the country. Its roots go back to the aftermath of the Civil War, a conflict that claimed more American lives than any other, leading to the establishment of national cemeteries.Key points in its origin:Early Commemorations (1860s): Various towns and cities held springtime tributes to fallen soldiers, decorating graves with flowers and reciting prayers. One of the earliest recorded observances was in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1865, organized by formerly enslaved people to honor Union soldiers who had died in a Confederate prison camp.“Decoration Day”: In 1868, General John A. Logan, leader of a Union veterans’ group, declared May 30 as “Decoration Day” — a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers. The date was chosen because it wasn’t the anniversary of a particular battle.Evolution into Memorial Day: Over time, Decoration Day expanded to honor those who died in all American wars, not just the Civil War.The name “Memorial Day” gradually became more common and was officially recognized by federal law in 1967.Federal Holiday (1971): In 1971, Memorial Day was declared a national holiday by Congress and was set to be observed on the last Monday in May, ensuring a three-day weekend for many Americans.While Memorial Day is often marked by ceremonies at cemeteries and monuments, parades, and moments of silence, it has also become associated with the unofficial start of summer in the U.S.

                    Thoroughly depressing. But part of the battle is reasserting our vision of America. Veteran’s day is about every American man who died in defense of the nation,especiallythe ones who fought against the genocidal Indian tribes and the autocratic Yankee government. I’m also unwilling to spit on the memory of decent people who carried rifles in Europe during the World Wars, even if the cause was wrong. The wignats who demand you disown your WWI/II veteran ancestors are as wrong as the leftists who demand you disown your racist ancestors.

            Yeah, I’ve become pretty ambivalent about it myself. My kid is a service academy grad and did genuine combat tours and could have died in that shithole for nothing. Nobody would have cared. The maudlin Gold Star and Memorial Day crap must ring pretty hollow if you lost your only kid over there just to fulfill Obama’s campaign promises.On the one hand I am very proud of my kid, on the other I am disgusted that every war this country has fought since 1812 has been a bullshit three-ring circus ginned up by the politicians and the defense contractors, and the Fatmerican public happily swallowed the patriotic bullshit they were spoon-fed. Hell, I guess I did too, until I was finally redpilled.

                The Mexican-American War was pretty meritorious. We were suffering from insurgent warfare from across the border and innocent American civilians were getting killed regularly by border-hopping Mexicans (some things haven’t changed). A lot of the greatest military minds and patriots of the Mexican American War went on to defend their country…as Confederate Soldiers.

            It’s hard for me to be too harsh towards people who were young and thought they were fighting on the side of good. I used to have a “W’04” sticker on the back of my truck and contacted my congressman in regards to urging him to support the defense of Israel. That, and a lot of other obsolete and incorrect beliefs litter the roadside to where I am now. A lot of veterans wouldn’t have joined if they could have talked to their future self.

        A few points for Memorial Day:1) I can’t think of any American war that actually benefited the American people.  I guess WWII short-term benefited the country economically as the rest of Europe was smashed.2)  If you know the Ron Kovic’s story, you know what can happen to the best and most idealistic/naive of American boys who enlist.  No war I can think of was worth dying or getting maimed for.3)  While there are elite troops and I’m sure there is good training and learning that can be done, a VAST portion of our serving members and veterans are mediocre to do-nothing pension slaves; not heroes and not remotely impressive.  They had no prospects and decided to put in their 20 years so as to be part of this big WELFARE program, which MOST of the US military is.  Shoot, single moms go into the military for the stated purpose of free childcare and whatnot.

            I think there is a case to be made that WW2 created an enormous economic tailwind for the US from 1945 until 1973, give or take a few years.

                Not only was the US the last economic powerhouse standing, the worst aspects of the managerialism that characterized the war effort and the immediate postwar economy hadn’t yet overshadowed the efficiency and coordination gains it provided.  Chiefly because, instead of ideologues using the business to push some utopian social dream, it was (mostly) still being run by practical men with an eye on what works.
In many ways it was a heyday of engineering.  Guys in white short sleeve shirts and ties, doing math with sliderules… or tinkering in their garage after work.

        The proliferation of cameras and tracking has been an enormous price for little in return.The state has license plate cameras everywhere which photograph your license plate, reads the number and records where you are and which direction you were traveling and the time and date.  They can reconstruct days of your life many months and probably years later.Now even the DOT is selling your data.  You have to get a license or ID card to do anything, so they are forcing you to get it and then selling your data.  How long is going to be before they figure out that the above travel data has some value and want to sell it?Cell phones and related technology have imposed enormous costs on society. We all bear these costs every day.  IMHO, the benefits do not outweigh the costs.  In fact, I question that there are any real benefits at all.

            Another fairly recent invention that imposes more costs than creates benefits is dirt blowers, a.k.a. leaf blowers. They generate deafening noise and air pollution, burn gasoline, and are not labor-saving devices; using one of those pieces of shit is no less taxing than using the old-fashioned rake and broom. I hate the dam’ things. Every morning on my walk to work I’m serenaded by the Dirt Blower Concerto in F-minor by Blose’ Gutierrez.

                I was driving down the road a couple months ago and they were using blowers on a site on the street.  From 3 blocks away I could see this giant dust cloud engulfing the road.  Despite it being a beautiful early Spring day, I had to roll my windows up to prevent having to choke on this damn dust.  Of course, it had to be on a section of the road where traffic backs up and moves slowly.

                While I, too, detested the noise of leaf blowers (always wielded by mestizos) when I lived in the ‘burbs, I bless the tool’s existence now that I live in the middle of the forest.  The first fall out here I raked . . . and raked and raked.  We have tons of trees and just trying to keep the lawn clear left me with massive piles that could have filled my house many times over.  And the battery operated blower we bought for the move didn’t cut it.  I bought a gas-powered backpack husqvarna last summer ($280 then, $400 now) and thank God for it.  The level of leaves out in the woods (where we blow our leaves to) is years’ old, and we’re leaving it to the Forestry gentlemen to come do a controlled burn.

                    My house is surrounded by Bigleaf Maples. After years of raking them, putting them out for the yard waste pickup, or trying to make compost out of them, I’ve finally decided the best thing to do with the leafs is leave them in place, run over them with my mower, and let the shreds decompose over the winter. They’ve all broken down by this spring and have made a nice leaf mold mulch under the trees.But of course, this is a suburb of Seattle and my neighbor isn’t happy about my use of a gas-powered lawnmower. F’ him. It’s too big a job for one of those wimpy battery-powered machines.

                        Husband tried that with the ZeroTurn.  Just shredded the top layer.  He tried burning some of the piles, but the bottom layersretained too much moisture.  I don’t care if it kills some of the grass, but I don’t want it to leave just bare dirt androcks.  Ideally want the whole yard planted in clover.

                Leaf blowers are just noisy brooms.  They don’t remove debris.  They merely move it from here to there.
That said, I love my Stihl backpack blower.  I manage a property that has a large asphalt parking lot under old pines and cedars, and I couldn’t collect the weekly dander without one.

        Well, shoot.  I missed something.
What is the other thing the Poisoners specialize in?
The drugs, the psych drugs.  The Poisoners created the Liberal crazies by drugging them into insanity.  Note they went for the weak links- the women, and then the kids, so they could get the next generation.
They’ve been promoting Mother’s Little Helper since at least the 50s, and school drugs (such as Ritalin) since the 60s.
And who created psychiatry, by the way?

        Remember the James Bond movie Thunderball? When the bad guys hijacked an RAF jet carrying nukes, flew it off somewhere and hid them, and then demanded ransom against threat of their use? It seems to me that the surveillance state has been promoted by people who were afraid of something like that, something that could threaten their power. Because they sure didn’t create it to go after ordinary crime.

            That’s another aspect of the surveillance state.  Despite the cameras being everywhere, they only use them when they want to use them.  If Luigi had merely robbed the guy, no effort to catch him would have happened.  If it hadn’t become a big international story, they would not have exerted the same amount of effort that they did use because it was a worldwide front page story.We have selective enforcement of laws that is so prevalent that it’s the norm.  If Rae Rae and DiQuan are shooting at each other and blow out a bunch of windows, but nobody is hit, no big deal.  There will not be an investigation.  If 250 “teens” go to a mall and get in a big fight and shut the mall down, they all get put on buses to go back home, there are no arrests and no written record of the riot.  This is one of the ways they cook the books to hide the crime.

            Surveillance makes crime textual. What you did is what’s in your report. Now your report is generated by a chatbot “aligned” to promoteinclusion—of white men in prison, and of his enemies in power.A common news story lately is cities ending their contracts with ShotSpotter because its simple system of triangulating microphones is too primitive to ignore non-white crime.Our rulers don’t fear nukes, we’ve learned definitively. That decades-long show was forus. They don’t fear bioweapons, which they make stupidly and release recklessly. They don’t fear anything, I’d say, but they do hate normal people, and they hate us so much they think weshouldkill them. (Of course we should.)So they fantasize that we’re trying to, and they punish every part of thatfantasy. In their stories, some words (it’s always words; movies begin as scripts)—some mean tweets, a manifesto, a demagogue, losers typing to each other, etc.—inspire young men to move in the world, to move with malice toward our rulers, or toward their proxies, symbols of being ruled (women and other preferred populations). This malice is mistaken. Our rulers are both great and good. They haveallgood qualities. They’re even super good at video games, like losers are!“Anarcho-tyranny”—whose record for least facially comprehensible phrase ever invented was finally beaten by “woke right”—is government treating the people as characters initsstory. As text.

                They don’t fear nukes, bioweapons etc. as long as they are the ones who control them. But nukes weren’t the point of my post. Enterprising and ingenious individuals or organizations wishing to strike a blow at the regime were. As the regime is well aware it richly deserves to have done to it.

        There is not a right to self-defense in any jurisdiction in America.  At best, what you have is an ‘Affirmative Defense” to shooting or murder laws.  Much of it is based on who is the prosecutor.  The laws are slimy.  Most places have a law that says you have to have acted “reasonably” and the way a person of “average intelligence” would have acted in your place.   What does this mean? Nothing.  “Let the jury decide” is often the standard the prosecutor will use.  Ask the McMichaels (Georgia), they will tell you all about it.  Ask Michael Drejka (Florida), he’ll tell you all about it. The examples are endless.You are far, far, far better off living in a non-diverse area than a diverse area with the “right” to put on an affirmative defense.  Even living in states with good laws is worthless if the local prosecutor feels the need to kick it to the jury.  Warning shots are basically illegal in every jurisdiction in America.  You would think this would be preferable to shooting to kill, but it is not and there is near 100% certainty you will be charged if the law finds out about it, which they almost certainly will.  We live in an era where people call the police about a kid walking home from school.  If you live anywhere near a neighbor, a gunshot will bring the police.In many jurisdictions, you have a “duty to retreat,” before any deadly force can be justified.  Being trapped is really the only way you will have a right to an affirmative defense. If you have any avenue of escape, you simply cannot use deadly force most of the time.  They’ve been chipping away at gun rights for 100 plus years. There is very little left.

                Generally speaking I agree that the Belichick thing is creepy, but that’s partly because she’s a bitch who treats him badly in public and disrespects him.But in the natural order of things, when a woman is in her natural place, she needs to be younger than her man but also deferential to him and his status. Grover Cleveland married a 19-year old who bore him three kids when he was in the White House (I think he was 52).Aristotle argued that the ideal ages for marriage were 36 for the male, and 18 for the female. A man is not supposed to have much “in common” with his woman other than his children. You see this with a lot of truly powerful men (like Trump). Guys who are that high status and that high-achieving cannot waste time and energy dealing with a woman’s petty, stupid bullshit.

                    The chiefmost complainers about male-female age gaps in romantic pursuits are aged women who are angry at competition they can compete with. There’s a reason European women were in favor of importing infinite fighting-age rapists from the Global South but refused to accept young Ukrainian women as refugees. That said, trophy wives are typically their own problems and wise men avoid them. 5-10 years is a decent age gap. The man’s typically out of the “apprenticeship” phase of his career and can provide a stable house. The woman’s young enough to keep him enticed until his urges start to subside naturally with age and he can appreciate her for her homemaking and maternal skills. The kind of woman who is looking for a man 15 or more years her senior with wealth and status is a climber, and she will always be looking to improve her station in life. The foremost virtue in a woman is fidelity. That doesn’t just mean not sleeping around, but devotion and commitment to her husband.

I was going to say of belichik that it is unbecoming, but otherwise not a big deal.

                Here’s a little something to rile up your ire–The eight-page “Colorado Wildlife and Biodiversity Protection Act”seeks to create theWildlife and Ecosystem Conservation Commission(WECC).Astonishingly, the WECC would consist ofnine appointed members, with the petition strictly stipulating that no member can have any financial ties to agriculture, energy, or development. The petition then goes on to (laughably) assert that these supposed “elite” members – without “financial ties” – will be appointed by universities, environmental groups, and policy institutes. Naturally, this commission will havetotal control over agriculture, energy, and all future development in Colorado.Deal with the DevilBut, have no fear landowners, the petition miraculously provides 25-50% tax abatement for those willing to hand over 49-100% of their private lands asdesignated wildlands…in perpetuity.Given the sheer naivete, and themultitudes of legal errorsmade by petitioners Jessica Presso and Cameron Porter, most would rightly assume the petition would be dead on arrival.Not so fast.Within days, the Colorado Legislative Council Staff and Office of Legislative Legal Servicessent Presso and Portera nineteen-page how-to guide, effectivelygiving free legal adviceby outlining the requirements for a final draft.Similar to court filings,when initiated petitions fail to meet filing requirementsfor single subjects, or properly address statutory amendments, they’resimply refused by the Secretary of State– placing the onus upon the petitioner(s) to seek legal advice.However, this departure from the norm now appears to be part of a growing trend in radical leftist states.OregonLeading up to the 2022 election in Oregon, a similarly wonkyInitiative Petition 13 was introduced to make raising, riding, eating or owning domestic livestock illegal.Similarly, the state donated resources to the petitioners by sending back a lengthyhow-to guide.After significant tweaks,that Initiative Petition isback as IP28and greenlit for signature collection ahead of the 2026 election.In addition tomaking it illegal to own companion animals such as dogs or cats, the IP would make it illegal to render animals for meat in the State of Oregon.﻿While some might be quick to dismiss the actions of a few, seemingly lone environmental zealots, others cite bigger-picture concerns for connections to IGOs and dark money influence.

        Really enjoyed this one, CZ.
So, I often wonder: were the 1980s great because of Reagan, economic prosperity and all that post-Carter euphoria, or were they great because I was in my twenties and life was nothing but upward trajectory both personally and professionally?
It’s a real question. Now that I’m in my sixties, maybe I can’t evaluate our situation. Maybe there are young people in their twenties who are living kickass lives, as I did in the eighties. I hope so.

        The topic of today’s post is thorny questions that provoke thoughtful analysis. And it’s implied that the recipient will somehow benefit from this exercise. But in reality, the responses are likely to be highly varied and unique to a particular person’s life history and experience. Once upon a time, effective answers to these types of questions evolved over time and eventually became known as local wisdom. And it was the duty of all townspeople to spread this wisdom throughout the community. No one had to invent an answer and hope for the best.

        Somewhat counterintuitively, the story of Abraham and Isaac was not about God demanding the sacrifice. It was about Abraham believing in the resurrection of the dead in his time and place. Isaac was born from a woman who, at the time, was far too old to conceive. One miracle creates the basis for the belief in a second, in accordance to the promise. Note also that the incident was a dry run and partial illustration of the cross. You would think more Christians would be aware of, and defer to, Paul’s commentary on the topic whenever it comes up – Hebrews 11:17-19.The question of what you would do to prevent child starvation is a sort of hedonistic moralizing. Since no human has that power, ultimately, the answer is left as a way to easily feel good about yourself over nothing.The deeper problem is that “the wages of sin is death”, and so, in the strict case of an evil or dysfunctional nation, starving children would be the expected and just outcome. God is on record as directing starvation in response to grave sin, and so it also needs to be noted that starvation can be a sort of grace that restricts the damage a certain group of people can do to themselves and those around them.These scenarios built around hedonistic moralizing often require a complete lack of strategic thinking. One pertinent example is how much harder it would be to flood Europe with Africans if America had not expended vast amounts of resources to feed those populations. America provisioned that army, as it were. Between the Old Testament and that example, one should be ready to make the case that feeding the children of other nations should not be standard policy.If your internal workings are so evil or dysfunctional that your children regularly starve, then they probably should, because at the very least, it is better to have less of you than more. Moreover, the pain that the lesser population goes through can spur repentance in a moment where change is easy. If no repentance is possible or desired, then “the wages of sin is death.” End of story.

        It will be a long hot Summer. Another Summer of Love. Bluesky may be quiet, but the crazies are not. The playbook is a repeat of 2020: riots, violence, culminating with an attempt to storm the White House and remove Trump and Vance “by any means necessary” the way they tried (but failed) last time.Trouble is that Trump’s team knows this and is ready, and has very significant backing most particularly the Military Industrial Complex which wants to on-shore manufacturing and a loyal and skilled manufacturing labor force. China’s failure in space which has no margin for Chinesium is due to its low skill, low motivation, low IQ labor force.The media is still going on about “there is no genocide of Whites in South Africa” and rapidly morphing to “there is and that’s a good thing.” While ramping up reparations in Congress and as political issues in the States.Establishment Dems like Van Hollen are all in both Kilmar AND Hamas, even after the Embassy murders. The dude who killed the nice looking young couple seems to have lots of connections, his father is connected to a Latino Congressman and the dude looks like Che Guevara Jr. Since the guy was captured unharmed, there will be both a lengthy trial and pressure from the Left to acquit the dude. There will be questions about who funded him, directed him to the scene, got him the gun, and more. Meanwhile first the fringes of the Dem Left then the Dem mainstream will defend the guy; and agitate for more shootings of Jews to “avenge Gaza” etc. The media will depict the killer as another Saint (see Luigi, the Boston bomber), while people’s X and Facebook feeds will show the girl trying to crawl away as the dude shoots her and images of her before: young, slender, pretty redhead. There will be more and more shootings in this vein, and that will be a crisis.It remains to be seen if Trump 2.0 can not let the crisis go to waste. The shooter was funded by both the Ford and MacArthur foundations, it would be hilarious to see the senior executives both perp walked and charged, and the foundation assets seized and not returned. The process is the punishment and “kill the Chicken to scare the Monkey” per the Chinese proverb.

        Z:“The other thing to watch for this summer is if the crazies get brought out of storage to riot somewhere. If you scan Bluesky, they are depressed. The money dried up and then the jobs dried up. Now they are left to trade scare stories to one another in the weird echo chamber that is Bluesky.”
One does have to wonder how much of the insanity is congenital, versus how much of it is simply low rent psycho-sociological prostitution on the part of the sh!tlibs.

                So strange how I was just thinking about this. In detail.Now, of course women are the font of all evil and such, but…Who told us this? Who has a book filled with example after example of what utterly atrocious creatures they are? Surely such a book is objective.Who tells us that this must be some scheme cooked up solely by women, suddenly and for no reason at all?In fact, who graced us with Critical Theory?And Civil Rights? And Affirmative Action?And then snaked their way into colleges…and then pushed, pushed, pushed women into college, so Affirmative Action could make damn sure they were prepped to become lawyers, and judges, and “education leaders”, and Certified Professors themselves, when…when…well, there was a time when not many women were interested in college.It was a place for nerdy guys to do cool stuff.Now it’s chicks learning about Marginalized Oppression and Radical Organizing and all those uniquely Anglo-Saxon cultural contributions.Odd too how none of this radical women’s stuff really got any traction until after 1881, or popped up in any other culture.Almost as if a culture whose forté of radicalizing identity groups seems to have set the gameboard that informed our women to become something else.Somebody really good at marketing…looking at women as a consoomer class eager to spend their newly liberated money buying stuff because Equality, Equity, and Empowerment. The same messaging unions do!Somebody really good at selling the sizzle.Maybe somebody that has a bone to pick with us?Or maybe, wants to seize power by different means?Or even just to make a butt-ton of money marketing hopes and fears to a different kind of buyer.Can’t put my finger on it.I guess our gals just decided one day with nobody prompting them.

                The only alternative promising a swift fix involves violence against the state, and state-adjacent actors, and all that entails.  A dicey proposition.  Low odds of success.  And regardless, the state apparatus is designed specifically to prevent leaders from coming up, and killing off those that do arise.  Organization is a big challenge.  Lots of normal ‘griller’ white guys hate this regime, but aren’t going to throw their lives away to save AINO.
Collapse is going to fix this.  If whites still exist they’ll survive better than the others.  Best we can hope for.
