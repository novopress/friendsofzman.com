        Great article! Most salient line? There are several, but this one pretty well sums it up:
The curve benders fear a second virus wave, but wait until they get a look at the second layoff wave.

            The curve bender cultists are worse still.
They immediately label anyone who dares question the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù curves as a moron, kook, or intellectual terrorist, regardless of the fact that the questioner may have substantial mathematical experience in their own right.
Save your energies for something far more productive than engaging with these cargo cultists!

                I also like how healtcare workers have become a defacto military wing of the cultists. In one city, they were using a wall of nurses (or something gay like that) to block protesters.

                    Healthcare in my experience are the most rule following script oriented morons pretending to be a science based discipline I have come across.The vast majority have little understanding outside the models taught at med school and even less interest in research. They blindly follow guidelines and parrot official guidance like some sort of priesthood. They could not develop their own diagnostic techniques to save their life.Even within the discipline the few doctors who actually bother to do empirical research tend to be pilloried and hounded even in their own profession if it goes against the dogma of the day.

                        When the $20 Trump pills were shown to be the best way out of the mess, many of the vaunted expert doctors refused to accept this unwanted reality.  No what we need are un discovered vaccines and 1000 dollar anti-viral medications.

            Some at Sailer have actually been pushing back.  My fav:  ‚ÄúMore case studies like this will only result in unbearable costs, bureaucratic paralysis, and a whole lot of spurious conclusions based on the illusory degree of precision and accuracy they foster, meanwhile more businesses tank, more livelihoods are lost, and more power accrues to an objectionable species of apparatchiks and busybodies.Is it your objective to replace the gender studies of the Left with your own equally useless cargo cult of meaningless data manipulation?

                Sailer was the biggest surprise to me. The only thing I can think of is that:
1.HBD is getting old hat and he is looking for a new focus that will get him back into the mainstream or
2. The invisible enemy has punched an emotional button and is providing us with more evidence that, in spite of all the fancy analytics, smart people, like everyone else, are primarily driven by emotion.

                Damn it, and I just bought this oxi-meter iSteve recommended.https://www.unz.com/isteve/buy-a-pulse-oximeter/It‚Äôs really cool.   If you have the Corona virus and you feel like shit, look at the oximeter.  It will confirm that feeling and before they can stick you on a ventilator, which will kill you, you rush to the hospital and show them your oxi-meter results and they‚Äôll treat you with meds instead.

                I deleted some of the personal rant parts. I just needed to get stuff off of my chest, because some days, I can‚Äôt handle all this bullshit.Today, there was a 400 pound Hispanic woman directing supermarket customers as though she were an aircraft marshaller. She even had two illuminated signaling devices! And I saw her rat someone out to a cop for not SDing, too. I didn‚Äôt know whether to attempt to use my entire body to strangle her or to explode into laughter. What a bunch of bullshit clownery. People fighting over a box of cheerios (oh, the irony). And the best part: none of this had to happen. None of it. We could‚Äôve just gotten sick.

                    Yeah, I met that same obese Hispanic woman directing people in the checkout lines at my local supermarket.  I think there‚Äôs only one of her but she‚Äôs able to exist in multiple places at once somehow.  Basically what this thing is, ultimately, is an opportunity for all the worst people in our society to get a taste of power.  Most of us only deal with DMV mentality once every couple years but now you get to experience it every day, everywhere.

Its not a bad restriction subject to the efficiency of the operator as it creates jobs and reduces risks and possibly leakage and similar pollution which is  a small amount if little cost per gallon.
To compare (stats from Oregon Business Report)
Oregon 900 and change stations with a shade under 10K jobs as vs just under 1800 stations with 12k employees  which is like 60+% more staffing and with close to the same per capita number of stations.

                Masks would ruin the tans idiot White wahmen think they need.  Seriously, this pathologizing of pale skin (white as a fish belly, etc.) is sickening.  One reason I don‚Äôt look as old as most others my age is my skin isn‚Äôt crinkled and covered with brown spots from sunbathing.  I like my God-given complexion.

        Well we have gotten a good look at what type of citizenry we have and how society will proceed forward with them. Like you said, they are  emotional and easily led or controlled.
If we didn‚Äôt have elites who weren‚Äôt just the same , I could predict how they would use this knowledge. You are right that mostly chaos is the new order and of course all that is left is the memories of a better time and people. Gird yourself everyone.

            Yes, there will be chaos, but Zman said, ‚ÄúTrump is‚Ä¶the starting point for a period of chaos, as the world tries to create a new ‚Äòlogic of the universe‚Äô.‚Äù That suggests that some kind of new order is expected to eventually emerge, and while it‚Äôs always a good bet that something really bad will result, that‚Äôs not an iron law of  history. Maybe something good will emerge. Even if we only get rid of universal-franchise democracy (which ensures mob rule), we may be measurably better off.

            The thing our financial wizards fear more than anything is asset deflation. Nothing deflates mortgage assets faster than people not paying their mortgage. In the mortgage crisis, we did not also have a collapse of energy assets and commercial paper. That‚Äôs a dob that has yet to bark. What happens when all of these bankrupt retailers stop paying rents?

                That‚Äôs why apartments and public storage facilities were popping up like mushrooms. If you‚Äôre a real estate developer, you have to develop real estate or maybe become a Walmart greeter. After the 2008 debacle the financial guys became unwilling to sort through a bunch of mysterious mortgage failures to straighten things out. They realized that loaning money for apartment complexes was less risky because when the rent doesn‚Äôt get paid the tenant moves out and is replaced. The owner that‚Äôs paying the mortgage remains the same. So there are new, fancy apartments all over the place.Even before this February there was wonder over what the occupancy rate was in these new developments. Where were the tenants coming from? Where had they lived before? Government statistics indicate that the national vacancy rate in January was 6.4%, a fairly low number historically. But, with newer complexes being opened to renters, this number must climb.

                            Honest question: how does it work socially there? Do you talk to your neighbors? Do you have friends in the neighborhood?
My experience in a diverse neighborhood is that people just talk to their own ethnic group, while whitey tries to be friends with everyone. But in reality whitey just doesn‚Äôt fit in and doesn‚Äôt really make friends with the other whites.
Just wondering what it‚Äôs like for you.

                                UFO, your experience is what it‚Äôs like here. The best I can say ‚Äî and it‚Äôs no small thing ‚Äî is that everybody seems to get along. I am unaware of any hostile acts or words among members of different ethnic species.Aside from standard pleasantries when residents are required by circumstance to be in others‚Äô company, there seems to be zero social interaction except with members of the same race or background. That‚Äôs not entirely because of diversity; a lot is down to the alienation you find in urban areas.The neighborhood around the apartment complex includes quite a few government and defense industry employees. They have long enjoyed unusual job security and good salaries, and their self-confidence seems to remain even in the face of the current political and social debacle. They don‚Äôt get in fights at the grocery or criticize people who don‚Äôt keep enough air around them. They‚Äôll stay calm while people in less prosperous regions, already broken, think about Whatever It Takes.I like the idea of some of our techno-gentry sliding into reduced circumstances. But I can‚Äôt deny that for now they are a stabilizing influence in this neck of the woods.

                        Check out the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) for a taste of your future.
Brampton, Ontario, known as ‚ÄúBrowntown‚Äù or ‚ÄúBramptadesh‚Äù is 44% ‚ÄúSouth Asian‚Äù, 13% black, demographically. It‚Äôs really 90% Indian outside of a few older subdivisions with whites and ghetto apartment buildings of blacks. Population is 600,000 and only 26% are white.
Markham Ontario, is 45% Chinese, and only 22% white. Population 330,000.
After a while they stop pretending to care about their host country and it just becomes India or China in Canada. It‚Äôs very sad and I hope that Trump actually bans immigration.

                But we kind of did. Not to the extent of negative prices, but they had fallen a lot more than they have today.  In the summer of 2008 oil was $150 a barrel and it fell to like $30.  The world was so out of storage that they were using oil tankers for storage and they were running out of them as well.

                ‚ÄúWhat happens when all of these bankrupt retailers stop paying rents?‚ÄùBailoutThe lesson from ‚Äô08-09 ‚Äì at least to the Fed and Congress ‚Äì is you can print and borrow all you want to save the system. The Fed just figures that money is credit so if credit (mortgages, bonds, etc.) is falling by around the same amount as you inject money into the system, everything remains in balance. (Also, the velocity of money is crazy low so money isn‚Äôt going anywhere anyway.) For Congress, borrowing doesn‚Äôt change the amount of money in the system; it just moves it around.Granted, this time around the Fed is moving from buying treasuries and govt-back mortgages to, well, everything. Buying treasuries from financial institutions that just sit on the money is one thing; buying commercial paper, corporate bonds, munis, commercial mortgages, etc., is another.As I‚Äôve said before, the really scary thing ‚Äì to me, at least ‚Äì is that the Fed and Congress have said that they will do anything and everything to fix this. They‚Äôve put their reputation, the trust that people have in them, on the line. If cracks start to show and people lose faith that the Fed/Congress can stop all of this, we‚Äôve got nothing left to fall back on.I honestly hope that doesn‚Äôt happen.

                I‚Äôm not sanguine about an economic recovery of any kind for a generation or two myself.The usual solutions by the people at the top, money printing and war won‚Äôt workMoney printing won‚Äôt help largely because none of the money drives demand enough to grow the economy and frankly new suckers err children  aren‚Äôt being born at any rateAny war would result in far too many loses. The damage caused by Kung Flu was probably accidental. I can‚Äôt imagine what an actual intentional Captain Trips would do and even assuming our decaying nuclear arsenal works, everyone else has them too.More locally. my cities  mall, not wealthy but functional and decently run is obviously a ghost town and while I didn‚Äôt go there for anything but the bookstore when it was open , the general assumption of many is that its not going to reopen ever.I guess all the edgy kids will have to live without hot topicA side effect of this is this crisis  will exacerbate the surplus of mall capacity we already have and to hammer commercial real estate is smaller developments too.Another nasty side effect is that even if somehow the economy recovers, spending is going to shift. You‚Äôve just given every younger millennial and Gen Z kid a crisis/prep/scarcity mindset.Gen Y already has been shanked several times as they‚Äôve tried to start out,hence the super low fertility rate but this crisis will put them into the ‚ÄúDo I need that or more stored food , TP and ammo‚Äù mindsetGood to remove R selection, bad for consumer societyAnd yes even  Liberals are buying guns at a clip, 75% of the current surge is first time buyers many city liberals.Changing to spend/abundance mindset  would require a minimum of two decades fast growth  which will never happen even with cheap oil.There is also not going to be an Amazon driven recovery. They don‚Äôt pay enough or employ enough.Lastly, the cheap oil is going to gank future production and thus any broom will be short lived if it happens at all. Oil price down, production stops, cheap oil gone, any recovery driven by that gone.And note this is the optimistic outcome. It can get hella worse . God help us all.

            ‚ÄúImagine what is going to happen when 25+% of mortgages go unpaid‚Ä¶.‚ÄùThe old solution to keep the mortgage market going was for the banks and their elite overlords to support increased immigration, hoping for a combination of factors:  (1) sheer numbers, legal and illegal, out of which some, accustomed to working hard and not blowing their money on material things, would come up with down payments,  maybe in conjunction with other legal or illegal family members, and (2) Chinese immigration and the Chinese investment in real estate that would bring, more than likely Chinese government money financing a big part of that.  Both circumstances helped to inflate prices, which was to the banks‚Äô liking.Maybe, just maybe, what‚Äôs good solely for the banks won‚Äôt matter quite as much anymore.  The economic priesthood gets out the garlic when talking about deflation, but it is not the bogeyman the elites make it out to be, and can actually be beneficial.

                I am looking for a nice, fat default by all student loan debtors. These kids, buried in debt by the same society that drains much of the earnings of an entire life during ‚Äúend of life care‚Äù ‚Ä¶ made it so perpetual renters = Millenials.And speaking of draining all the wealth while keeping dementia patients alive long enough to make sure their reverse mortgages preclude homes being passed down to the next generation, conveniently creating new mortgage holders to buy, or renters forever ‚Ä¶ all this ‚Äòclap for an hour‚Äô bullshit is not for me. I know, everyone is a ‚Äúhero‚Äù.The lights in your rear view that pull you over, conveniently because you are the right, um, demographic to pay a fat fine.The Surprise Medical Bills, hidden costs, that then force you at gunpoint to PAY UP OR ELSE we will ruin your ‚Äúcredit‚Äù in a society that lives on DEBT.Not ‚Äúheroes‚Äù. STFU and do your job. You got to get fat off the calf of our middle class lives with your $400 ear wax clearing. Now suck it up and clap for yourselves or get another job. And stand in front of my rightful protest by car, I might get out and beat your ass hard, hero. Like your Antifa ‚Äúheroes‚Äù.

                            Homer;I‚Äôd venture that the reason medical providers ‚Äúhate hate hate‚Äù telling you what something ‚Äòcosts‚Äô is that they have no clear idea themselves.For example, take the ‚Äòsimple‚Äô problem of how to assign the cost of an MD degree, say $250k up front, to patient visits.  It is clearly a critical asset, and it‚Äôs too big to just ignore.  Common economics dictates that its cost must  be recovered (else who‚Äôd go into medicine).  Yet, if you say to amortize it pro rata, you must guesstimate how many patients you‚Äôd see in a lifetime.  Who can do that_?I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt have any great ideas how to go about it.

                                Big Al, I don‚Äôt disagree with you. I also just assume it is human nature to resent doing work that you are not getting paid for, or in a more bureaucratic world, ‚Äònot my yob man.‚ÄôI have a GP that has been with me for some 30+ years. Great guy, swears like a pirate, really looks out for me and my family. He has told me that some procedures cost less than my co pay if billed as a non insured. The guy does his best to skirt the system, pro patient.So when Obamacare risked me and my family losing this valuable asset, I let him know I would have none of that. I told him that if my carrier was not accepted there, who the fuck cares. I (and my family) am staying as a cash patient. He said he had never thought of that ‚Äì shows you how even well intentioned people can fail to think outside the box.There was no problem with remaining, and it turned out at the time that our new Obammy ordered carrier was picked up by the GP‚Äôs medical group. Although I doubt Obammy was speaking of my approach when he promised people could ‚Äúkeep your doctor‚Äù‚Ä¶.

                        I tried to create some starter sourdough last year and it was  a total failure.I bake a lot of bread, but I cannot get costs that low. Even the store brand flour is like $5 for 10 pounds. For convenience I bake it in a small toaster over that is pretty efficient and it‚Äôs still like 15c in electricity cost (about a kwh) The store brand bread is .99 loaf. It only lasts 2 days.  I wish I knew what to add to it to make it last a week.

                            I can‚Äôt speak on your personal experience. I can say that my missus puts a lot of work into starting and maintaining starters. I see her daily feeding of water, flour. She bakes bread in a full sized oven and buys supplies in bulk since she is practically proofing or baking every day. It really is amazing the amount one person can produce, to the point that store bought sweets and bread are not needed. Plus home baked is so much better, not to mention the fun of having it happen in the house, the upbeat scents and outcomes. Not everything is a big success, sometimes bread fails to rise enough, or too dense. All edible and all natural and compares to the $6.99 artisan loafs.

                            Buy a bread box and store your loaves there. Your bread will last a week at room temperature. You can find cheap ones at discount stores but for reference:https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Kitchen-Dining-Bread-Boxes/zgbs/kitchen/13880451I prepare all my home meals from scratch, including bread. Say what you will. I keep Amish friendship bread starter in my fridge but not sourdough.My customary bread-making technique involves baking yeast dough in an 8-quart enamel-coated dutch oven situated inside my standard kitchen oven and wrapped with baking parchment. I coat the parchment with cornmeal and flour, then unceremoniously dump the dough ball out, twist the parchment and toss the ensemble into the preheated dutch oven with the lid tightly sealed then place this back into the kitchen oven. 50 minutes later pull it out, remove lid, cut the top off the parchment and reinsert into the oven without the lid for 10 minutes and let cool on a wire rack. This method give me easy, cheap and delicious bread.I grind my own flour from grains in a Vitamix blender. The flour I find locally on-sale, and it‚Äôs often grains originating from Bob‚Äôs Red Mill. I let my dough rise in the microwave oven with the door closed as that‚Äôs insulated the dough from vibration and temperature shocks. I acquired a cheap hand-cranked grinder for when the electricity fails, as happened for a week once. Stay at it.

                            I second SearsTower. Sourdough shouldn‚Äôt be hard.1. You don‚Äôt have to feed the starter every day. You can keep the starter in the fridge for weeks without feeding and then fire it back up over a day or two to get it back to full health.2. Get a bread box. Sourdough naturally stays fresh for around a week.3. Use the no-knead method for making the dough. Breadtopia has good video showing how. Just Google ‚Äúno-knead breadtopia‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt take hardly any time.4. Cook the bread in either a dutch oven or, much easier, a Lodge combo cooker. (It‚Äôs hard to drop the dough correctly i the dutch oven. The combo cooker gets rid of that problem.) This will give you the oven spring that you want.5. Use bread flour as well.Honestly, sourdough isn‚Äôt hard. Stick with it. Also, sourdough is much better for you. Look it up.

                                Looky what we have going! Ok, caveat is that I am the bread EATER and breadmaker observation post. I see that starting a starter means daily feeding for a week or two, but since I am the beneficiary of marrying well, that is based on my observations. I am no bread maker.
However, I have observed the Dutch Oven in action. The brand Bob‚Äôs Red Mill. Our oven has a proofing setting.
This is more fun than absorbing fear porn!

                                    HomerB,
The Lodge combo cooker is much easier to use than the Dutch oven. Put the dough on parchment paper first. Score it. Then put it on pan part of the combo cooker and finally place the pot part on top.
No more trying to drop the dough into the dutch oven like some WWII bombardier. Also, remember, use the no knead method. Simple and easy.

                                        A new loaf was born today, to be part of tonight‚Äôs dinner. I am going to copy this breadmaking feedback to share. Decades of successful marriage is partly due to not being overbearing on my part about her things and I trust she does not make too many ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù when I am laying under her car fixing it.
That said, some valuable points here, the parchment paper info piques my interest. Again noting that I am not the breadmaker. I can do lots of things, but respect this craft from just watching and enjoying the results.

                                I used a name brand ‚Äúorganic‚Äù wheat bread flour for the sourdough starter.  Everything was going well until about a week in.  I‚Äôm going to try it again.I generally use regular flour for my regular loaves.Does the bread flour work better?I have one of those wooden bread boxes with the rolling lid. It‚Äôs one of these:https://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-People-Original-Rolltop-Storage/dp/B016N233JS/The best thing I‚Äôve found for improving the bread is proofing the dough in the oven with a pot of boiling water.  You get a much lighter loaf and much better rising.I‚Äôve never made the no-knead dutch oven bread, though I‚Äôve seen a bunch of YT videos on it.I don‚Äôt have a Dutch oven. Maybe I‚Äôll pick one up when the world goes back to normal.Homemade bread is just way, way better than store bought bread, absolutely no argument there.  Hot homemade bread with supper is unbeatable.

                                    I have a Dutch oven and have tried the no-knead recipe (from youtube vids) several times. My loaf is always still doughy in the middle. Perhaps my oven (gas) just doesn‚Äôt come up to temp. I don‚Äôt have an oven thermometer so don‚Äôt know for certain.
I avoid buying breads and baked goods as I generally try and reduce carbs in the ol‚Äô diet, but it would be good to get the bread-baking skills down to a predictable quality outcome like some of you appear to have done.

                            Freeze it. Bread thaws fast and doesn‚Äôt get soggy.  Buy pre sliced or slice before you freeze. You can pry it apart pretty easily.

Prices are about double what they were, particularly compared to what I used to pay (on sale/with coupon).  But none of that counts as inflation.

            The Fed will step in and buy the mortgages, probably leveraging money from the Treasury, and/or Congress will start a program to pay those mortgage payments.
Defaulting mortgages (due to renters not paying) destroys asset prices, i.e. deflation. Powell lies awake at night in fear of deflation. They will do whatever they can to prevent it, but it‚Äôs a battle. There‚Äôs too much debt relative to income. The Fed and Congress are trying to counter the lower income via money printing and borrowing. That works until it doesn‚Äôt.

                I agree. But look at the big success these masters of the universe have had with oil. They may be in over their heads.
As one of those weird savers, I am exposed in the event of a significant currency devaluation. And I am not naive enough to think it could happen. My plan is to live as if 75% of the value of my cash holdings are gone already and equities are worth zero.

                    The dirty secret is that the Fed and Congress can only try to push the head of the beast. If that animal wants to go left, it will go left no matter what the Fed or Congress do. They can plug holes and push at the margin, but they can‚Äôt ‚Äúbe‚Äù the market.Btw, you‚Äôll probably see deflation before you see inflation. Plan for both. Cash and bonds are great for deflation, terrible for inflation. Stocks definitely don‚Äôt like deflation and aren‚Äôt too keen on inflation, but they‚Äôre still good to have around long-term. Nothing wrong with keeping 5% to 10% of your portfolio in gold. Real estate, particularly farmland, is good for inflation. Cash/bonds, stocks, real estate and a touch of gold is a nice combination. It‚Äôs the Talmud portfolio.

                    Yeah, we‚Äôve got a place to go, too. Infinite water supply (practically.) However, we‚Äôll probably only have two or three guns to defend ourselves, with about 7 or 8 men of fighting age. I fear roving packs of vibrants.
But I still doubt it‚Äôll get that bad.

                        Lawdog,Experience has shown me the ‚Äúroving packs of vibrants‚Äù don‚Äôt really much do the rural thing. As a matter of fact, they are as uncomfortable as a hoo-arh in church. I‚Äôve had some humorous encounters. It‚Äôs the land of crazy-ass white men and all the animals are scary, in their eyes. Hispanic compasinos (rural or farm-area originating Mexicans) are the exception.  They are about as ‚Äúredneck‚Äù as our rednecks and probably have more in common with you than some big city Anglo barista does.On the practical note of too many hands and not enough boomsticks I suggest looking at gun stores for used shotguns. I‚Äôve seen older serviceable breach-loading shotguns for as low as $79. I have a buddy who keeps these things in every vehicle he owns and scattered throughout his house. He doesn‚Äôt  fret over their possible theft. He showed off one day and was single loading aimed shots down range at about one per 2.5 seconds. 12g buck, depending on load, that‚Äôs roughly 28 to 36 x 32 caliber rounds down range every 10 seconds. That‚Äôs a lot of lead.You can train up your extra hands in a day or two with these and it beats Quaker guns. Ammo is relatively cheap and while it‚Äôs not true that scatter guns require no aiming, they are forgiving on lack of skill. Press the breach-break lever, crack open, load, aim and fire. Not finger fumbling the load is the only tricky part. You can kit out a fireteam for less than $1000. Save your long arms for distance, aimed shots and fire suppression. Shotguns up closer.Sorry to drone on with unsolicited advice just thought it could be helpful. I live in a rural area and it‚Äôs always our methheads and local bad boys you have to watch, even when it‚Äôs just localized power outage.the rest stand out and the unwelcome mat is easy to roll out.

                The reason we have so much debt and subsequent deflation is of course wage arbitrage .This combines with low fertility to basically create a zero sum market and ends up with a few people owning too much stuff to actually have an economy .Unless wages go up, keeping asset prices from free fall is difficult, in times of a general depression like we are going to enter is  like pushing on a string.The smart thing to do is a general default and jubilee but that won‚Äôt happen unless there is a total collapse or its goes big igloo.What interesting beyond the insane damage to the economy  this lock down has done is guns sales. All time record, 75% of them first time buyers many city people and liberals.That  changes the calculus from ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù since its easy enough to avoid pushing risk and violence adverse conservatives too far too ‚Äúit takes only a match.‚Äù since the Left has no issue with violence.

                Or they can revert to the tried and true method of surcharging fines and then writing tickets out to everyone on everything.  Things were so bad in NYC once that police were writing tickets for sitting outside of bodegas on milk crates.  Not sure if it was a loitering ordinance or improper use of a milk crate.

            With law enforcement and all other local functions, what happens is centralization of power. The one thing local and state governments can‚Äôt do is print their own money. The tempatation of fresh fiat dollars will cause them to willingly hand over what independence they have left.

                Where I live it is patrolled by rural Sheriff‚Äôs Deputies. I guess because they live here and oftentimes don‚Äôt have backup they are pretty judicious on enforcement and quite friendly. Most of their time is spent dealing with local meth addicts, 51-50s and gangbanger types that hover around the casinos.I‚Äôve never actually seen them ticket the locals, and we have some dizzy locals here.

                    Not good for most of the speed traps here as they are set up to nail people in the 30 mph zones, local driving.What DOES work for over the road travel are cheap radar detectors. Years ago there was an ‚Äòarms race‚Äô between John Law and detector manufacturers. X Band was replaced by K Band. Replaced by Ka, instant on, then finally laser. The issue with laser is it is a line of sight tool, so the cops actually have to do some work. I have spoken to a couple of them and asked why they use radar when they have laser right in their car.‚ÄúToo much work.‚Äù They can set the radar to go off at a speed threshold. Here is the thing. The arms race ended when the authorities gave up. Even a $65.00 Cobra is going to pick up K and Ka at plenty of distance on the highway. And since so many cops just drive around brain dead with this shit turned ON in their cars ‚Äì it lets you know where they are, even locally.Not perfect, but if your aim is to avoid that one moment of exposure when the speed limit drops from 65 mph to 55 mph, 55 to 35, 45 to 30, all the usual trap zones and you are not looking to speed per se, running a detector wired to come on when you start your car‚Ä¶. I say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt leave home without it.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt.

                        Well, really there needs to be an integrated speed control system that automatically sets your speed for whatever the local limit is using Google map data and takes data from multiple radar and laser sensors in the car.  They probably already offer this in luxury models but I drive a cheap car so I need to actually look at the road signs.

                                I think I‚Äôve already mentioned my latest Toyota automatically films the speed limit signs and posts it on the dashboard.  Very minor step from there to limit acceleration to match the posted signage.  Big bro is always watching.

                        Seconding this recommendation.My co-pilot is a Beltronics GT-360, which is a rebadged Escort model. It picks up stationary traps and rolling patrols plenty far off.It also provides GPS-based speed readouts and uses GPS to build its own internal database of stationary X-band door alarms and K-band radar signs/photo cameras.Most police are just out there blasting Ka-band radar all over. My unit picks up the leakage from the back of their radar guns long before I ever see the speed trap.I also agree with the comment about laser (lidar) being too much work for the average cop, especially in moderate to extreme traffic volumes. I had previously deduced this conclusion on my own, so it is good to have confirmation from an actual officer.The only thing my detector doesn‚Äôt have is the EMI/RFI shielding that makes it invisible to VG-2 and Spectre radar detector detectors. This is only an issue in jurisdictions where radar detectors are illegal.

        Our society and culture is like a forest managed by the government instead of nature (hello US Forest Service). Every little lightning fire is brutally and immediately suppressed thereby enabling deadfall to accumulate year after year. Then one day, a careless camper triggers a minor brush fire than sweeps outward at lightspeed and in no time becomes a raging uncontrolled inferno. That is the coming chaos. And when the smoke clears. the tallest and strongest trees will remain (scarred but straight) and the decaying deadfall turned into ash.

        ‚Äú In fact, no one knows if they will actually try to do it voluntarily. Local officials have gotten the whiff of authoritarianism in their nostrils and they like it.‚ÄùThis is really scary. Although many of them may not be as naked and outspoken as the dictator of Michigan, there are a LOT of local government officials who have made it clear they‚Äôre happy to let their lockdowns drag on forever and don‚Äôt care the slightest about the suffering of the people they rule.But they‚Äôre oh so concerned about releasing the poor criminals from jail, though! The jail space freed up from released robbers, burglars, muggers, and drug dealers (let‚Äôs not kid ourselves: most ‚Äúnonviolent‚Äù crime is pled down from the more serious crime that actually occurred) is conveniently freed up for the future storage of anyone who protests lockdown.

        I think most here can not help but notice that governments around the world made everything worse in every way they could. From a tyrannical communist government like China to a supposedly ‚Äúfree‚Äù democracy like the US, we have seen governments lock-down their people and their economies in counter productive ways.I can not prove it from here, but I suspect that the stronger the government the greater the damage. Certainly, the more bureaucratic the government the more unnecessary damage was done.If a year ago you had told me that we were going to destroy the future of the young people by producing, on purpose, the greatest depression the world has ever seen to stop the spread of a corona-virus I would have called you nuts. I would have pointed out that the corona viruses mainly cause the common cold. Who would destroy the economy of the world to stop a few old people like me from getting a real bad cold and maybe dying a few months early.But, here we are.

                I think they might do some good depending on the time and place. But I bet going will make you feel better and that is something in itself.
Perhaps the governor of your state will claim that the people ‚Äúmade him do it‚Äù and re-open the state. Worth a shot I think.
And the above comes from a real pessimist.

                Protests are fine when there‚Äôs a reasonable expectation of those being protested bowing to the will of the protesters, e.g. college presidents to BLM.  In this case protesters will hear one giant ‚Äúlolgf‚Äù.  Something stronger‚Äôs called for.

Yes, I think I will go. I‚Äôll wear a mask and gloves for the sake of optics and not getting arrested.
I love how the left is imputing partisan motivations upon the protesters. As though there were something partisan about losing your job, home, or business. Nevertheless, I suspect these protests are going to get a lot bigger.
Something stronger? To what might you be alluding?

I am too old and not in great health. As a young man I might (yes, FBI I said ‚Äúmight‚Äù) have been tempted to use my long gun and send a politician to his just reward. But that itself might be counter productive. So, I don‚Äôt know.
I would love to see a mob go crazy and invade a statehouse. But it will not happen, and it probably would make matters worse anyway.
I got nothing really.

I am 27, and I have a kid on the way. I was finishing up training for an important jump in position and salary. Now, because that training can‚Äôt occur, we a lot have less money to raise our child. If I didn‚Äôt have a kid coming I wouldn‚Äôt be (as) pissed. Maybe that‚Äôs selfish, I don‚Äôt know.
I just don‚Äôt see Murphy budging on this. He‚Äôs crying about needing more tests, whatever the hell that‚Äôs supposed to do.
I hope you‚Äôre staying healthy as you can. I appreciate your advice.

                                    We‚Äôre still riding on the idea that testing is essential because the virus is so deadly. If Smurphy orders more testing, well, then maybe people will take it more seriously.
But he is retarded. I hope the protests intensify. I hope he is shown options. You know, a result in which he learns that he can‚Äôt get everything that he wants.

                                        The laughable testing regime is the Left‚Äôs pseudo-scientific means of establishing the pitifully tiny denominator used in the the death rate calculation.
Anyone with more than two functioning brain cells understands the virus has spread to far more people than those who have been tested.
This means the real denominator in the death rate equations in enormous. Even with the juiced death number they are using for the numerator, this is just the flu.

            The most revealing slip was how the establishment concluded the CCP‚Äôs response was rational and that we had to copy it. When most of our establishment is owned by the CCP in one way or another it‚Äôs not surprising to see them emulate their owners.

                    It has been shocking to me how the Branch Covidians honestly believe the $22T US economy can be flipped on and off like a light switch.

                    Grocery store shopping is metaphor for America and its subjects. The shepherds order shoppers to stay ‚Äútwo carts apart‚Äù from one another and herd them down one aisle and up the next. The shoppers, in ovine fashion, obey, all while wearing their silly masks. Shopping has become an exercise in human beings turning into sheep.

                            Ironically, the more incontrovertibly the facts show that Coronageddon is actually a nothingburger, the more draconian the measures against it become. There is madness here. There is a wallowing in authoritarianism. And there is a mule-headed refusal by the pissant tyrants to admit they were wrong.

                            This is going to make people want to shop a lot less unless they stop all this nonsense in its tracks.Otherwise people who have just spent ,months doing with less with keep doing with less.This means no recovery at any point.That said there are protests all over the place. Media ignores them, Facebook tries to stop them .Problem is the system will not yield and the results of enough to push back to  force them  to  yield would be worse than the current problem.Right now the options are endure and hope it goes back to semi normal or  everything gets very very very very bad.This calculus may change though if the economy fails to recover which is the highest probability result. Very bad might seem OK with a hope true or false.

                                    There is a pushback movement going on but its being fought online with leaks since the media is avoiding covering anything that could possibly help President Trump.For example the Timcast has a  lot of stores today about media saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need masks‚Äù and about a viral picture that Buzzfeed (yes them) of Nurses blocking anti lockdown protestors very probably being fake and other older ones.There are lots of other stories out there as well on YouTube and elsewhere.The thing to remember is the Democrats and to a lesser degree Never Trumper allies don‚Äôt care very much about the little people or the economy only power.They‚Äôll do damned near anything to get it even destroy the economy.This kind of behavior might end up fracturing the union in any number of unpleasant ways  but no one is thinking long term these days.

                Most ‚Äòsmart‚Äô people I‚Äôve worked with in the *data* field are shockingly innumerate, as well as being unable to understand complex information relationships (especially in regard to uncertainty and time-orientation). The ‚Äòsystem‚Äô becomes the truth. Big Tech‚Äôs ‚Äòbig data predictions‚Äô about who you are or what you do sometimes are shockingly accurate, but just as often insanely inaccurate (but we tend only to hear about the accurate predictions).‚ÄúThe Map is Not the Territory‚Äù is pretty much an unknown aphorism these days.I go back to John Gall‚ÄôsSystemanticsall the time. Though this specific aphorism comes from Alfred Korzybski, whom I have yet to read.

                90% of them have an IQ 100 or less. They can‚Äôt be expected to understand complex ideas especially when the experts do not have a clue either.
I‚Äôm not defending the stupid but it is a novel virus and our experts aren‚Äôt all that smart, They go by models and rote and rarely think.
Worse very few of them have any understanding of other disciplines or exposure to other experts and complexity requires an interdisciplinary approach to be successful.

        What happens in a world suddenly awash in BTU‚Äôs? No one knows.
That‚Äôs not really true. We‚Äôve experienced periods of cheap abundant energy in the past. ‚Äî at least, relative to what was available before. In every such instance I know, it has corresponded with a tremendous improvement in human well-being.
The question now is, how will it interact with the shutdown. Hopefully it will have an ameliorating effect.

                I have here. Prices down to $1.38/gallon at some discount pumps. Ramp up some Kroger points with your grocery purchases and you can get gas below $1/gallon.
This has measurable effects. For example, we dispose of a lot of construction waste. At $1.38/gallon, it becomes economically beneficial to drive the truck to the cheaper landfill farther out of the city.
Every mile on the road for truckers is more profitable than it was before.
When the farmers are planting or baling hay this spring, less of their gross is going to pay for fuel for the tractor.

                        I can empathize. Where I live the average is $2.65 for regular, I hop over the state line and drive ten more minutes there are three gas stations where the price for a gallon of regular is anywhere from $1.83, to $1.91. It‚Äôs inexcusable. I get lotto from one of the other stations and I asked the manager of the station why the big disparity compared to next door and was told that the owner of the station will not lower the price. The guy couldn‚Äôt say why.

            The world runs on energy, so yeah, cheap energy is typically good in the short run. This is something different for two reasons. One is the volume. We‚Äôre running out of storage capacity. That‚Äôs new. There‚Äôs also the fact that we have financialized the energy sector. No one knows how levered these energy contracts are or how much is pledged as collateral.

I‚Äôve heard suggestions of filling up the strategic petroleum reserve to previously unhead-of levels. I also heard that Pelosi fought against it. Seems like that‚Äôs something Trump could simply do via executive order on grounds of national security.
The Fed is busily buying up bad debt. Buying up good oil seems like a better deal.

            It does not mean free energy by any stretch.  The actual price paid by consumers and businesses after it is refined, has not fallen that much. Gas is still $1.8/gallon and much more expensive elsewhere in the world.. Cheaper oil can mean   higher profits for refiners  , not necessarily lower prices  for  businesses and consumers.

Read up to some replies to me. Gas prices aren‚Äôt holding high everywhere.Street price has fallen drastically in some areas, and that certainly means it has dropped heavily for companies that buy fuel in bulk.

                            12% adds up from a business perspective. Got a lot of investments paying you 12%? Fantastic deal.
A fixed expense that costs you 12% is less is like earning that much more in profit.

            You‚Äôre probably thinking of the early industrial revolution and that was certainly true then.  The current energy glut though, is politically manufactured and the same political authoritarianism that created it will suppress the kinds of growth that might make life better.  Think of how the Soviet Union had absurd amounts of natural resources available to it and yet remained poor and unproductive.

                I‚Äôm not just thinking of that. I‚Äôm thinking of the widespread adoption of coal as an energy source. I ‚Äòm thinking of the steam engine, which while it wasn‚Äôt a new energy source, brought portable, consistent power to wherever the user needed ‚Äî it was the first time portable multi-purpose power wasn‚Äôt muscle-powered.Every time man has been able to bring more energy to more people cheaper, it has been a good thing.I agree that there will be forces trying to suppress the growth, but I think that has always been true. The glut may be politically manufactured, but it‚Äôs an act of desperation. This race to the bottom wouldn‚Äôt have happened if they didn‚Äôt feel threatened ‚Äî the fact is that energy *is* cheap and abundant, and will remain so long after oil and natural gas are gone. This is a suicide dive that could well break the very powers that are trying to manage it.

        Mass media is mass propaganda, financed by corporate ad dollars.I wonder if a giant society like America can exist without some mass media creating an ‚Äòofficial shared narrative.‚Äô Back in the day, common religion, political beliefs and general culture probably did this but they obviously can‚Äôt do the job anymore. Without Hollywood and MSM, would America even be ‚Äòone society‚Äô in ANY meaningful sense. This is not to defend either, I know exactly what they are and they perversely seem to fit a society in deep, deep trouble in their current form. But I also wonder if America even IS one society today. Much of the same could be said for European countries but they have two advantages, they are far smaller and the native population is of far older stock.

                I think there was an official shared narrative back then, a mix of Christianity, very strong commitment to ‚ÄòAmerican ideals‚Äô, ie strong civ nat, and also 90% were white.
Today none of these could ‚Äòbring the country together‚Äô. And accordingly it does seem to be coming apart.

                    Who, whom.
Who controls the shared narrative and upon whom is it being imposed? That‚Äôs the difference.
In the days when religion imposed the shared narrative, it was imposed upon the great as well as the small.
Note: I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you.

            I‚Äôve been trying to explain The Panic to myself for the last few weeks.  It‚Äôs easy to just pin it all on the media but the media routinely throws out panic-bait about all sorts of stuff ranging from guns to climate change to ‚Äúdeadbeat dads‚Äù.  Thankfully most of these campaigns fizzle and normal life goes on.  Why did this one take hold so fast and so well?It might simply be that people (particularly women and feminized men) suddenly had a grand collective ritual to participate in and feel like they were part of something.  The ‚Äúgeneral culture‚Äù in fact has been fragmenting since the 90s.  First it was just geeky young guys making their own internet culture but now you see a fragmentation in popular entertainment as well with numerous watch-on-demand episodic dramas, comedies, and documentaries as well as YouTube channels vying for attention.The Panic may have become essentially a burst of centripetal force designed to counter all these centrifugal tendencies.  Women especially felt that by putting on those goofy Halloween masks they were once again part of something greater than their Netflix queue and their next Tinder hook up.This is likely to be a very bad thing and could be the first shot in a sort of modern Cultural Revolution complete with gangs of Red Guard types enforcing the 6 foot rule and beating people who don‚Äôt have masks.  If so it would be ironic indeed that the virus came from the country that gave us Mao and the original Cultural Revolution.

Fortunately for us (UNfortunately for them, heh,heh) we‚Äôremuchbetter armed than the Chinese peasants were. Wasn‚Äôt it Chairman Mao who said something about power flowing from the barrel of a gun? Antifa weenies are more likely to carry an umbrella than a gun. I reckon they‚Äôd piss/soil themselves if they started to assault some guy with an umbrella (as they did in Seattle not long ago) and their intendedvictimdrew down on them.

        The Foundation Trilogy by Asimov was one of my favorites in high school. I‚Äôm glad Zman referenced it. Replace the Mule with the Hive Mind and you have a good approximation to how chaos is ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù. Except that we now have a Disrupter-in-Chief. The Hive Mind just stepped on a rake and is reassessing its prospects in the light of this new reality. Good stuff. Strap yourself in.

            I wouldn‚Äôt write the Hive Mind off just yet.It is clear they are already busy pushing several different new narrative threads to keep the fear levels up. Those threads include the second wave, reopening too soon, and virus mutation.I‚Äôm doing my best to live as normally as possible and avoid any engagement with hysterics. For now, I‚Äôll put on a face-covering if it means I can purchase groceries without being confronted by some hero or some ninny calling the local Gestapo on their smartphone.There is no point in debating the hysterics.

                The problem is if the shut down continues for much longer we will start seeing other sorts of shortages like food.

They‚Äôre even being employed to block off protesters.I think it‚Äôs an important part of the plan. The state and media need a large, prestigious sect of the public as allies. They‚Äôre our soldiers now ‚Äî and you DO support the troops, right?Addendum: I‚Äôm losing my mind by gayness again. I was watching BBC Arabic, and this Spanish video comes on of all these dancing, ponce doctors singing ‚ÄúYou have to stay in your house! La la la la!‚Äù THAT‚ÄôS the stuff they think works on us. Cutesy displays of enthusiastic obedience. Nothing better than being cute while you follow the rules, right?

                Yep.  As the healthcare industrial complex stacks in more and more childlike brown people from exotic locations like every other industry.  And the freaks they have taking care of people.  If you walk into a hospital you realize how quickly the latinos are going gay.

                    The most appalling thing about going into a hospital is that a large majority of the ‚Äúhealth care professionals‚Äù display no concern for their own health and appearance.  All I see among the nursing crowd are jelly rolls under pajamas.

                            Because you only need a few smart herders. Then simply by turning the herd and stampeding in any chosen direction anyone standing in the way will get crushed.
Its like a giant hammer that can be turned using media in any desired direction at will (look at this crap ‚Äì 5 weeks in and every social convention for the last thousand years has gone out of the window as if it never existed).
And given its hammer its only action is to smash things. People think the other target deserves it until its focused on you.

                The adulation shown towards everyone from health care workers to cashiers is a symptom that we‚Äôve removed God and spirituality from our world.  In 1958, those spared by the influenza knelt by their beds or in the church of their choice and thanked the Almighty for what blessings and mercy He may have bestowed on them.  Today, we deify the earthly among us and wag our tails at them, hoping to get a pat on the head.  It‚Äôs much easier to get that dopamine rush of sanctity when you can choose your Gods from among those easily flattered.

                        The personal injury lawyers declared war on death as well as life, with all its bad luck and pitfalls, long ago.  Now there are warnings on everything.  Devolution can be blamed on this in part, as well as the populace‚Äôs lack of survival skills.  This current madness is the culmination of the PI attorneys‚Äô mischief, people thinking they should never experience pain or sadness or loss.  Or death.

            Karl;I fear you might be right about the war with the PRC being in the offing.  The stuff we *know*^ they did is pretty close to the ‚Äòdeliberate act of war‚Äô line.  If the virus was from a People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) Offensive BioWeapons Program, *and this could be proven*, it‚Äôs hard to see the situation not getting kinetic at some point in the near future.  This would be true even if the virus‚Äô release was accidental.  At this point who‚Äôd believe the ChiComs even if they fessed up and claimed accidental release,Suspicions are rightly high because the stated objective of PLA military medicine is to keep the PLA healthy and fit for combat.  Therefore they had  no innocent reasons to be working with bat virus.  In any foreseeable conflict, the PLA will not be hiding in bat caves, which is the only real way to get infected with a bat virus.___________________^Lying about human-human transmissibility, yet locking down all travel inside China but sending a million Chinese from Wuhan to all other parts of the world, while claiming it was rayyycisss to block their entry.

            Karl-Don‚Äôt disagree with you. I think that the PRC is looking to seize Taiwan because of its strategic importance to the West. That tiny little island of 23 million punches two or three orders of magnitude above its weight with regard to microelectronics and semiconductor fabrication.Part of me believes that the very public stories about carriers in crisis is bait to draw the mainland into showing a few of its cards.Local air superiority is no longer a forgone conclusion for Taiwan and 2 or 3 USN carriers. The PLA Air Force has a large inventory of fighter aircraft that are quite competitive with the F-16s/F/A-18s/F-35s that would be fielded by the West. They have developed their own native AWACS capability.Also bear in mind that the Chinese are far ahead of the US in terms of hypersonic missiles. At this time it is not really clear if any Western player has a solid defensive answer to the Chinese hypersonic capability.

        You‚Äôve correctly noticed that Red-Team and Blue-Team are not [two sides of the same coin] but actually the same side of the same coin. As far as them going against what the voters voted for, one only need look at the votes against legalizing [gay] sodomized marriage, which were quickly overruled by courts. Other examples of Federal and local governments going against the will of the [people] subjects are rife.Oil futures were traded at historic lows, which is just the way futures trade ‚Äî they beome worthless the moment they expire ‚Äî  but the more important data point is that oil itself is trading around $20-$24, which after accounting for inflation is cheaper than the $10 per BBL it traded at in 1999.You mention Asimov‚Äôs The Mule; I might as well again mention that Isaac Asimov‚Äôs brother was the editor of New York Newsday, and that his niece writes for the San Francisco Chronicle, and his nephew writes for the New York Times.You use the phrase ‚ÄúAt the various LEMON PARTIES, the sobbing and moaning about Trump was understandable‚Äù..https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lemonpartyhas the following to say:  One of the unholy trinity of internet pictures which all must witness to be ‚Äòjaded internet users‚Äô (tubgirl, goatse, and lemonparty), lemonparty is probably the tamest of the three by just being hardcore old man gay orgy sex. Believe me, the other two are worse.

            You are too ‚Äúhard on‚Äù homosexuals. üôÇ After centuries of being relationships at best hidden, but sometimes punished with prison or worse, finally with the legitimization of gay marriage, at last two fudge packers could be Man and Husband, just as Nature intended, well no, but just as they wanted.

        I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt dig for it now, but a Z-reader today mentioned that the common cold is often a common coronavirus.  (There are some some 400 types of virus.)
True, and that‚Äôs why I fear ‚Äònationwide testing‚Äô.
The test only indicates if it‚Äôs a coronavirus, not if it‚Äôs specifically a Covid-19 coronavirus.
They‚Äôll be able to accuse you of anything they want to, basically, an excuse to take any powers or actions they wish.

            no shit. What a great scam.We test for virus markers from the corona family that probably 60-70% of the population carries around most of the time outside summer and we run a police state until this is eradicated.As these viruses mutate quite rapidly and are extraordinarily common this never, ever ends. Its prima facie impossible to achieve this outcome.I would not be surprised if it was picked precisely for this reason (rather than say ebola). Imagine testing every person for the cold virus variants and reporting these as positive on death. The rate would be (as we see now) massively skewed.You just need to convince people that the common cold is somehow the black death, which we see has succeeded fantastically.The added benefit is that there are no real adult political arguments that can be made as everything is framed as an expert health narrative. meaning normal people are dismissed from the discussion and there are no historical arguments to push back on this.Credentialism is all that counts (your superiors and betters) and they are even more beyond reproach in the cloud than political figures.The added benefit is that the majority are so mind numbingly vapid from mass education that the ‚Äúsettled science‚Äù fuckwits are seen as an authority and any disagreement is unable to be internalized on data arguments, and so credentials must be used instead as a gauge of accuracy by the normals.We are always going to lose that argument when its random guy with simple maths vs Ivy league dept models and ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.

                I don‚Äôt see the Dollar losing its status as the reserve currency; if anything I see that it is becoming more widely used, in more countries, both by local overseas companies (who issue their corporate debt denominated in dollars rather than the local currency) and individuals who realize that in spite of constant devaluation of the dollar, it‚Äôs still less than the extreme devaluation of their local currency (e.g. Zimbabwe Dollars).The Federal Reserve could spend the next hundred years issuing tens of trillions of dollars, distributing them worldwide, and still not destroy its cachet or [too much] of its value.

                What replaces it? Well, not the Euro, or the Ruble, as for the Pound, don‚Äôt make me laugh! According to Dominic Frisby the Chinese have been buying up gold in massive amounts for the last 20 yearshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MhywXK2pg&amp;t=858sSomehow I can‚Äôt see the world going along with that. Maybe what replaces the dollar as world reserve currency is a world with no reserve currency.

Seems they are trying, but nothing replaces energy, the petrodollar.
Even SDRs are based on ‚Äòa basket of commodities‚Äô- mining and drilling, or the energy to run the machines, in other words.
And, to clarify about the Fed running the world- through cutouts, of course, the Fed doesn‚Äôt pay interest TO the US Treasury.I don‚Äôt think the World Bank pays anyone either.  I wonder which other BIS banks don‚Äôt.Edit: oops, I see some SDR comments.

                        Direct barter isn‚Äôt that common or likely outside of a new dark age,The many sellers/few buyers you mentioned is the conundrum the economy faces . Growth can only happen with fertility , economic stability and increased wages but the no one is having kids and automation and cheap labor keep wages low.The more urban we get the more its costs to have kids and people will not in a urban environment sacrifice the benefits of that setting to have more kids nor will they have them without a mental guarantee of a couple of decades employment keeping up with costs.This puts a natural barrier on the number of buyers.The natural TFR is basically 1.5 or a bit more in essentially every developed nation  and there is no way back.Governments and big business are strip mining the economy both to pay for retirees and to loot but its destroying the foundation, seed corm yum.Ultimately even if we somehow get back to the early 2018 economy which is really improbable, the TFR that year was well below repalcment alreadyNow that people have been spooked , I‚Äôll guess minus anti accidental lock down babies (which will be  rare since birth control is still for sale and many fertile age people are unmarried) won‚Äôt effect fertility trends.The TFR may go down more since no one wants kids in the current situation.We‚Äôve scrwed the pooch.As for trade, the less the better. Customers are a zero oer even negative sum game and only fairly extreme economic nationalism is able to provide an economy where family formation is possible.

                The SDR is the global settlement currency no one has really heard of.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sdr.asp
For countries its already been used for  settlement since the 70s and is used quite a bit in international shipping.
Its a small step to perhaps detach from the underlying nation currencies, spin into an electronic currency and base it on some for of energy unit (especially if you can bankrupt oil and ban other fossil fuel) it really can be used to keep a cap o the energy expenditures by dint of the currency itself.

                    Somewhere around here I‚Äôve done some posts advocating the SDR be pegged to a basket of energy commodities. Basically, the global reserve currency should be the BTU. That would result in a gentle deflationary system as energy efficiency gradually improves. It‚Äôs not a perfect arrangement and getting the mix of commodities right would be a challenge. Still, pegging the store of value to something that literally powers technological progress makes a lot of sense.

                        That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen.  It was originally proposed by FDRs Treasury Secretary, (((Henry Morgenthau))) in the 1930s.  And he was correct in wanting to do that.  Of course we weren‚Äôt in the strong post war position we were in in 1944 with Bretton Woods.  I‚Äôm not sure it will be a SDR, but we will return to a pegged position among world currencies, likely with a commodity basket, and yes, that basket will include gold, but it won‚Äôt be the majority of it.  They may even us the Goldman Sachs commodity index, SPGSCI, and just peg it one day as the dollar inflates.  We‚Äôre in the late stage of Triffin‚Äôs Paradox, so we really won‚Äôt be able to keep our reserve status without some kind of structural change in four or five years.  No more free floating nonsense.  The problem for the Fed is that you can‚Äôt please the Eurodollar market and the domestic market at the same time, and now you have a basket case indebted government to deal with (that they enabled over 30 years).

                        Why would you assume it would be deflationary?That assumes a market open behavior of innovation.If you kill off oil and other fossil fuels and nuclear you massively do away wit the easy access and most longer term energy storage. You could then make any system you wanted if you control a centralized energy rationing. Especially if all transport is now based on non-portable energy.It also has the benefit of the money supply control being able to be used to strangle the economic functions by restricting the supply and therefore the energy as a system of interlinked credit allocated to each nation.It would be a perfect lever of technocracy.

Now you‚Äôre scaring me.Once the elites own everything- the money, the capital, the assets, the bureaucracy- what do they need capitalism for?
If they control the chokepoints of energy, healthcare, and army, then we might as well tatoo our social security numbers on our arms, and start watching Rollerball.

                        Z Man;Intriguing idea.  A fixed *peg* to BTU is maybe the way to go: A pseudo-gold standard, if you like.IOW, would we really want a consumable to be money_?  The theory used to be that ‚Äòmoney‚Äô was, in itself, necessarily useless.  Some pretty weird shyte has been used as money (woodpecker scalps among Pacific NW Native Americans, for example) but even if it wasn‚Äôt durable, almost never was it consumable.Money‚Äôs role is/was to be medium of exchange and a (relatively) stable storehouse of value.  Consumables tend to fluctuate in value depending on supply and demand for them as consumables, per se.But part of the re-ordering ought to be taking a hard re-look at economic theory.  The view of money (above) was a part of pre-industrial economic theory that never got so far out of whack as to be discarded.  But that body of theory held that the major factors of production were Land, Labor &amp; Capital.  In the post-industrial era that we find ourselves, Energy (and Information) seem like better candidates (probably along with Material).

                There‚Äôs a lot of ruin left in the petrodollar.  We‚Äôll see its end later than sooner and I don‚Äôt think one universal reserve standard replaces it, be it another nation/bloc‚Äôs currency or a basket of commodities, etc‚Ä¶  By the time the petrodollar fails, regionalism will be stronger, with non-standardized/universal currencies in ‚Äúthe West‚Äù and the BRIC-Silk Road coalition (or whatever it  evolves to by then) ‚Äì and likely some smallish third parties as well.

                The founding fathers wanted only gold and silver to be used as currency .

                Maybe.  Maybe what replaces it is a floating mix of local currencies.
Here‚Äôs the thing.   The petro dollar, dollar as world reserve currency, whatever you want to call it has really only existed since the 80s.  In a way, it‚Äôs a driver of and function of globalization.   If globalization abates, so does the need for a global reserve currency.

            The consequences of the USD losing reserve currency status will be so horrific and so bad that it is hard to fathom life after reserve currency status.  It will affect everyone. It would probably cause something akin to hyperinflation where the dollar loses 90% of its value in a couple of years and a worldwide economic collapse. One assumes they would change all the rules in order to avoid it.

        The glut of oil is really a glut of money.  I have been reading over at ‚ÄòOur Finite World,‚Äô that America‚Äôs shale oil production is losing money since 2010 or 2011. The $150 a barrel oil of the summer of 2008 pushed a bunch of money into oil formerly too expensive to produce. But since the world cannot afford $150 a barrel oil, it could not support the new sky-high price. I don‚Äôt know how they are able to continue drilling and producing for 10 years losing money, but I got this from several sources, everything from oil blogs to the financial press.The world had this same problem back in 2009 after the great recession. Oil was dropping and dropping, all the storage tanks were full and there were oil tankers parked in the ocean trying to lower supply to drive the price back up.  If our government had any sense, they would be filling and expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is fairly cheap, underground and buys a lot of security.  But the gov is too busy funding leftist causes with the pandemic stimulus rather than funding a rainy day operation.

                Europe needs Russian oil and gas. Even if all of the oil in the US were financially viable, we really cannot export any of it.  No matter what you may be reading in the mainstream press, we are a large net importer of oil.  All you have to do is look at the amount of oil we produce per day vs the amount of oil we consume per day. Unless production rises over consumption, we are net importers. We are millions of barrels per day away from that milestone.Also, the spot price of oil doesn‚Äôt represent most oil. Most oil is in long term contracts.

        One nit to pick in this otherwise spot-on essay is that while the media reporting of crude oil going negative yesterday was hyped up and largely full of nonsense, the event itself is more than simply nonsense and has importance.  First off, the price of crude oil really was negative for a while, at least for any actual transaction via a May futures contract, meaning that with any provider/producer (can‚Äôt really say seller) of a contract at a negative price will have to pay the taker (can‚Äôt really say buyer) to take the stuff away, so long as the taker stands for delivery.  The fact that this happened at all reflects an (at least perceived) absolute running out and absence of any storage space for above-ground crude.  It becomes like that lack of chairs in a game of musical chairs.  For a producer or holder of crude oil, it can become less expensive and much less risky to pay somebody to take the stuff away than to continue storing and/or take the risk of even being capable of storing that which is not yet delivered yet already committed to (a very serious problem).Of course, some of yesterday‚Äôs futures market drama reflects flat out dysfunction in the crude oil market.  I know some of it, a lot of it actually, is simply this.  I‚Äôm not a true believe in so-called ‚Äúefficient markets‚Äù or any other libertarian market religious dogma. Yesterday, while the May contract at one point fell as low as $-40 per barrel, the June contract remained calm and held around $+22 per barrel.  Today, the crude oil futures market has largely recovered from yesterday‚Äôs dysfunction, with the May contract (last I looked) trading around $5/barrel and the June contract coming down to around $12/barrel.  Because the May contract expires at the end of today‚Äôs session, it is now essentially the cash (spot) price, although discounted for inconvenience (must buy in bulk, must take delivery at specified date and time).  Thus, it will probably go up a bit, and the crude oil price will settle in somewhere between $5 and $12 per barrel (at least for the time being).This tedium actually matters, because it reflects how dysfunctional and seized up everything is ‚Äî absolutely everything.  Everything in our society, and thus by implication in our lives, runs on crude oil.  Even food these days, at least the overwhelming majority of it, is simply the energy contained in crude oil converted to our edible caloric energy.  It is because of this that I largely ignore the media, all media, and its constant trumpeting of panic, sometimes tempered with ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù stories, mixed and matched, I suppose, in an effort to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù the emotions and hence the attitudes and beliefs of the viewers to the desired level.  Speaking of demand destruction, while the amount in crude oil is disturbing, I hope the amount of demand destruction in the advertising market goes off the charts.  The first step to the reduced power and influence of media, of all types from legacy media to Silly Con Valley social media, is for the whole lot of them to suffer a substantial and permanent loss of revenue.  A loss of power and influence will follow as day follows night.  One can dream, at least.

            It was mostly speculators that lost in that market and will keep losing.  The average person has no business getting into the futures market, but many are in there thanks to these get-rich-quick platforms and internet connections.

            Crude oil update:I just rechecked quotes, and now the June contract is down to $9.52 and May is up to $9.40 per barrel.  This is only 12 cents difference, so the crude oil market has now with certainty stabilized and found its level.  Of course, how long this lasts until the next bout of dysfunction and what it will look like next time is anybody‚Äôs guess, although a couple few days prior to June‚Äôs expiration is a good guess.  Still, I don‚Äôt pretend to know.Of course it‚Äôs mostly speculators playing their too cute by half risky business games that were in this.  This reality is the 2nd most significant factor that produced the dysfunction in the first place.  All but the most experienced, and more important than this the luckiest, of such players got creamed.  Most of this crowd is going to stay away from crude oil for a good while and go play in a different playground (if not shut down for fear of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man).Of note, while the May contract has a volume so far today of 11,653, it still has an open interest of a larger amount, 13,044.  I interpret this in conjunction with the crude oil market itself having actually calmed down to mean most if not all of the open interest is standing for delivery.  These are contract holders who actually have the storage space.  Excellent deal for those who bought while the price was negative; rather than having to pay for the crude oil they purchase, they‚Äôll get paid to receive and accept it!  Great business, that is for those who lucky few who were able to do this transaction in the first place.  Lucky bastards.

                Keep in mind, this is a market that has been relatively untouched by the bailouts so far.  But don‚Äôt worry.  Trump is working on it!  Right now as we speak.  Some hash of a program will be hastily developed to ‚Äúsave‚Äù an industry that‚Äôs not in danger and needed a shakeout anyway.  But it‚Äôll be like he‚Äôs coming up to my pockets and stuffing cash in them.  And then he‚Äôll start a little blow up on the Iran border, throwing the prices into reverse.

            Ignoring the legitimate fear of disease for a second, people don‚Äôt want their business ruined, an arrest record , a mandatory month in jail (or longer, courts are closed for the emergency) or a SWAT raid so compliance makes sense unless enough people can get together to organize without being censored even  trying.
White Americans do need to learn a more collective approach to life and  to thinking and axcting but it takes time and comes with risks, if the nation doesn‚Äôt work for all and ours does not, a tribal nation will fall.

        ‚ÄúOil markets would no longer be the victim of forces beyond the control of suppliers. Instead, prices would be steady as producers coordinated with world government to temper supply‚Äù.A consistent theme of the +/- 150 yrs that oil has been a busines is the wild swings in supply/demand and the price of oil, but the ZMan quote above fairly well describes the last 25 yrs.The most pressing issue now is that there‚Äôs no place left to store it.  Tankers are floating storage.  Cushing, OK about to fill up all the storage tanks.  The never before seen sub-zero futures price reflect the complete unknown territory about to be entered.Chaos indeed.

        Not only have the powers that be had a chance to experience the sweet smell of authoritariasm in the morning but their lives have become much easier. They currently don‚Äôt have to pretend to care if the economic lives or daily lives, in general, of their charges are improving. The masters can crack down on any dissent and do away with those pesky things they hate: freedom of speech, movement, religion (Christian variety) and gun ownership. The majority don‚Äôt care. They just want to be protected from the invisible enemy and are content to hide at home.The WHO has anyway informed us that we will never go back to life as it was. Lower your expectations boys because people will die if you want freedom and a job.How, our new world will hang together economically, I have no idea but it won‚Äôt be to our benefit but then what is even in normal times?

        ‚Äù THE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äù In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct.

        Trump may be chaotic but calling him an ‚Äúagent‚Äù assumes both agency and an agenda.Like every POTUS of my voting lifetime, he‚Äôs all man, no mission.  From St. Ron to Zion Don, the ‚Äúmost powerful man in the world‚Äù has largely been a fixer and skid-greaser for the real elites behind the curtain.Some CINC‚Äôs have been more palatable to various factions of the Kosher Sandwich than others ‚Äì Obama with Optics-NYT Lefties vs. Trump with Jignat-NY Post-Righties, for instance ‚Äì but none have ever pushed a ‚Äúvision thing‚Äù that was their own or that was in any real way contrary to the Davos Set‚Äôs agenda.From a sci-fi standpoint, Trump is more Neo than Mule.  A messianic harbinger of change in Episode I-The Escalator, a puppet on his Architect‚Äôs strings in Episode II-The Bloviator.Unlike the Matrix, there will be no Episode 3 for NeoCon Don.  The Chumpening will end not with a new balance of power in human-(((machine))) relations but rather with Installment 2‚Äôs black-pill Architectural victory-lap.

            I‚Äôm not familiar with G. Faye.  From the blurb for his book *Why We Fight* at Amazon;‚ÄúIdentitarians and others making up the European resistance lack a doctrine that truly serves as a political and ideological synthesis of who they are ‚Äì a doctrine that speaks above parties and sects, above rival sensibilities and wounded feelings, that brings the resistance together around clear ideas and objectives, uniting them in opposition to the Europeans‚Äô dramatic decline. Our people today face the gravest peril in their entire history: demographic collapse, submission to an alien colonisation and to Islam, the bastardisation of the European Union, prostration before American hegemony, the forgetting of our cultural roots, and so on. In the form of an introductory text and a dictionary of 177 keywords, Guillaume Faye, one of the most creative writers of the European ‚ÄòRight‚Äô, makes a diagnosis of the present situation and proposes a program of resistance, reconquest, and regeneration. He holds out the prospect of a racial and revolutionary alternative to the present decayed civilisation‚Ä¶.‚ÄùSounds pretty good. Probably has some anti-Anglo traditional French Chauvinism, but no big problem.

        very great essay, Mr Zman. yes, Faye in proper perspective really only describes the upcoming interregnum, not an objective proposal per se, rather an artsy descriptive prose of a dystopian aimless (hopefully temporary) future.the Mule, it has to be a Mule. the biggest one of them all, that one the mischievous pagans drew hanging from a cross when they first met His followers. later they‚Äôd know better.similar with our orange man, albeit without as much of the Truth that He brought, but with all the paradoxical works and upsetting of everything in regards to politics at least. the slaves, those simple and based in heart, can sense the change coming. the elites, they will blindly play their petty games, until the centurions come to storm Masada and nothing remains but a weeping wall‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or string us along one more time, perhaps caving in some way so they can stay safe atop while we enjoy some extra morsels. if some immigration ban and energy independence and some autarky and better welfare/less usury comes out of the appeasement package, maybe we cannot complain much. although looking at those BTUs, the way the small business loans are being misspent on/by usual suspects, and the apparent adcom-bubble-2.0 you describe (makes sense, enough startups), idk, can‚Äôt be too optimistic‚Ä¶ even if the grey clouds are leaving, it must rain a bit, else (((they))) won‚Äôt learn to bring a coat and umbrella‚Ä¶ whatever happens, onward Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and other Rebels (coincidence, i think not)‚Ä¶

        I‚Äôm impressed to death at this analysis ‚Äì apparently, so are other people (Instapundit, among others).I‚Äôm an oddball in feeling OK with chaotic systems (I married a man whose middle name is Spontaneous). I keep the important parts of my life the same, and mostly listen and nod at the nonsense.But, I make my decisions only after my OWN investigations. I don‚Äôt follow the fads, nor am I easily persuaded by emotional pleas. That‚Äôs true in investments, and in other facets of my life.I realize this makes me what Sarah A Hoyt calls an Odd; I prefer to think of myself as an outlier, particularly among women.
