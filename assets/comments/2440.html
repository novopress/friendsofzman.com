        Yeah, I hate women bosses too. They manage like it’s a high school clique. It’s like they have never been in a situation where they have had to actually lead a group.I left the current job because I had a woman boss that made me leave her a note, every day, that I’d locked and alarmed the place at night. I’d been doing it for years and never failed to do it. I went to Netflix for a year and found out she was gone. New maanager is a guy and I can’t say that I’ve had any issues with him.

        …but (from real life) the EEO folks are pretty stupid: they count boxes on the org chart… Once there came a day when all the org charts showed team leads in boxes…And the EEO folks went away!

        @GOBSMACKERAn astute observation.  When the woman boss moves on and is replaced by a man, the gals become calm and happy once again.  Funny old world.

        The worst challenge a woman faces in the workplace is a female boss.  Women are their own worst enemies.  That’s a fact.  But blaming other women gets them no sympathy.  Blaming men does.  Because, victimhood.

        “A woman who leaves her job for five years to raise kids is coming back to work not just having missed five years of working. She is now behind the college grads in many cases.”It’s now what you remove yourself from design for, it’s that you’ve removed yourself.Had a guy I worked with in a design group. Married to a nice Filipino girl. The company offered him a position over there as a manufacturing manager. 6 years later I bumped into him; he was still there and had moved up the management food chain, but he admitted that he couldn’t possibly step into his old job – &gt;50% of his knowledge was obsolete.

        Math, hell! Best advice I got was from a network admin. I asked him what skills would be useful and the first thing he said was psychology!

        I knew some women chemical engineers and chemists who were great, knew their stuff, and were very valuable in a project team.
I also knew some that were ignorant, and worse, were determined to remain ignorant. Refused to learn how to do their jobs. A lot of chemical jobs are OJT, you know. Not stuff you get from college, even to the PhD level.
Problem is, both types of women got promoted and put in charge of stuff. The good ones, and the ignorant ones. So what’s the point of being a good one?

        I do tech support for an ISP. I’ve done it for years now, am good at it and the guys I work with take me seriously. And yet I get calls, mostly from women, that hear my voice and say “oh, I wanted technical support!”  It’s 2014. You’d think that they would know that there are women doing tech support, but I guess they think we all do billing.

        I like the bit where she’s upset about having to plan parties. I’ve been in software teams for almost 20 years, and one thing I’ve noticed is that nearly all women want office parties, and men in technical fields never do. So my informed guess would be that she demanded parties, they humored her by wasting their time standing around eating shitty Crisco-frosting sheet cake, and then she got upset because she had to do all the work for something that she wanted and everybody else hated.We had a middle aged DBA lady who started demanding birthday parties. Inevitably, management decided to humor her. So we just didn’t tell her when our birthdays were. A few months later she left anyway, for family reasons. She hasn’t been replaced. It turned out that her responsibilities only amounted to a few hours a week, so three of the guys divvied it up. Nice lady, though, even if she wasn’t a real tiger technically. I really liked her.The promotion thing is funny too. They expect to be given authority as a reward for showing up and fulfilling expectations. Sticking their neck out taking responsibility and showing leadership (or, in larger shops, engaging in really aggressive bullshittery, blame shifting, and ass kissing) is too hard and risky for the poor little dears.In time, they’ll demand that technical management be reserved entirely for the girls, to give them a career path that doesn’t involve actual engineering, which very few of them enjoy or excel at.

            I think we’re already see a soft management path developing. I know a gal who is a software manager for a global firm. She can’t count to ten, but she manages the software budgets for the whole company. She gets to participate in project management, which mostly means going to meetings and enforcing company policy. From the outside, I think her job is entirely made up just to have a female executive on the technical side.Friends tell me this becoming more common. The real work is done by project managers who are saddled with some gal with an MBA and zero technical ability. She produces progress reports and does budgeting. It reminds me of what happened to the personnel departments in the 80’s. They rebranded them Human Resources and staffed them with women to solve that problem.

        As always, my attitude is “Or else…WHAT?”Of course, I’ve cultured a history of being a swell guy. A freakin’ sweetheart.  But you won’t like me when I’m angry.“Sorry, not interested”, followed by “Return to sender”, is the polite way. Any hounding after that is simply a matter of “Mmmm…I see, OK, let me have a few days to think about that…”(while I decide just how much of a message I want to send to your new found “allies”, and THEIR “underpinnings”). MOST of the time, “I can’t be bothered” works out best, for a variety of reasons.
