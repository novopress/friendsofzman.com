        The growth of government via Progressive schemes for more socialism and its  attendant “programs”, requires money and lots of it. When the money stops, so will the programs, and government will shrink or rearrange itself into a more manageable size.  Who knows when the gravy train for Fed. government runs out, but Greece and Puerto Rico are the canaries in the coal mine.

        Things in public/political life can never return to where they were. It is like a spiral that may, for a time, go one way but it even going the other direction doesn’t stop it ever expanding.When the UK’s Labour government in the immediate post wars years introduced all sorts of nationalisation including the National Health Service, the die was cast that all public/political discussions from then on were never likely to be whether a ‘service’ at the public expense should be curtailed, but only how it could be ‘improved’ or ‘refined.’ In the case of the NHS, it became such political hot potato that no subsequent government even remotely dared to challenge whether this was the best system or not. Even the most supposedly right-leaning Tory government was always at pains (no pun intended) to emphasise how committed they were to the ideal of the NHS.This by the way doesn’t stop all the protests from the hard-of-thinking lefties who scream that ‘The Tories Are Out To Kill The NHS’ when there is never the slightest doubt the Conservatives would never consider such an option in a zillion years. Both socialist and supposedly right-wing administrations spend vast amounts time and effort on the NHS and all of them pump billions into it and merely argue the direction of this huge ‘investment’The issue however does get clouded by for example the appearance of Blair in 97. All politicians began to think that left-leaning, young(ish) looking and ‘with it’ was the only way forward. The old (and for that matter, the experienced) were out and so too was anyone who wasn’t ‘switched on’ and had camera appeal. So Cameron wins and spouts the same thing that Labour would spout if they won. True, it doesn’t stop the lefties hating him but then they hate their own leaders too, so at least in this nothing changes.

            You hear the same thing about Social Security here on this side of the Atlantic. Just once I’d love to hear a candidate for office, when accused of wanting to get rid of Social Security say “Yeah, I DO want to get rid of it.” As for Reagan, he stopped the rate at which the wrench moved forward, but not the movement. I’m with Derbyshire- I think we are doomed!
