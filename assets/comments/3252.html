        Sorry Z. I can’t agree with you about Uber.Uber puts the customer, not the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, back in control.I don’t know anything about the “sharing economy”,but I drove a cab in NYC many, many years ago, when I was in college. It was a crap job then and I don’t imagine it’s improved much today, (except back then we all had college degrees).I think Uber does a pretty good job at distributing scarce resources to where they’re most needed, when they’re most needed. Uber also incentivizes the drivers to be customer oriented, as the drivers are reviewed by the customers (like on Amazon)I’ve used Uber many times when visiting NYC where cabs are always in short supply. Better cars, better drivers &amp; speedy service. Best of all,there’s none of the indignity of standing on a corner waving your arms about trying to attract a rattletrap yellow cab.The price for an Uber “black car” is about the double that of a regular yellow cab, but the price includes the tip. It’s well worth the extra to me. I think Uber keeps one third and the driver gets two thirds. It’s no different than calling an ordinary car service except its much faster and you can see them driving right to you on a real-time map on your phone.I never use cabs in NYC anymore, except when I come out of a hotel and they’re parked right out in front. Even then, the NYC cab experience sucks.The cabs are crap and the drivers are usually sullen &amp; unappealing.There are fewer Yellow Medallion Cabs on the streets of NYC today than in the time of Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. This has raised the price of a NYC Taxi medallions to over a million dollars each. Anything that disrupts this completely artificial supply constraint is okay with me.As for insurance, good luck suing if you’re in an accident with a taxi. I believe you’ll find that NYC cabs carry only the required minimum amounts. The medallion itself is not owned by the cab company, only leased, and each individual cab is it’s own separate entity with virtually no assets other than the aging vehicle.NYC Taxi medallions are a good example of regulatory capture. The medallion owners want to protect the value of their medallion monopoly and do everything they can to prevent more being issued.Without real competition you get typical crap monopoly service. Uber has dramatically altered that equation. Good for them! Good for us!…

        Most Arabs are convinced the Jews run American and Europe. Since the problems in the Muslim world are the fault of the West, the Jews are to blame.
The cab driver had some very elaborate conspiracy theories about how the Jews control his country. I forget the details. Conspiracy theories are really popular in that part of the world.

        Seriously, Z? There are probably about 1000 Jews left in Moslem Pakistan, and that is being generous. Jews have never influenced anything in Pakistan, this is simply Moslem anti-Semitism. Which the Moslem “immigrants” bring with them when they come to our country.

        A lot of the cab regulations are in place to keep the competition out and therefore the prices high. So, while I think your points about the “sharing economy” are valid, Uber has picked on a business sector that could use a shaking up.

        Around here, the cabbies are all third world. I had a Paki cab driver a few years back who spent the entire time telling me how the Jews destroyed Pakistan.

        Good post and valid points.About twelve years ago when I used to drive home from work I would listen to a BBC program of full of bitty news packaged to entertain (or sometimes inform) drivers like me. One bit I looked forward to was a five minute report on the financial world, essentially reporting London’s financial position. The guy who did it was old school Londoner which — contrary to Dick van Dyke’s accent in Mary Poppins — is not all mock cockney (Mockney as we call it) but in a cheerful working class accent now labelled as ‘estuary English’This meant he would have hailed from the east end of the city, probably be in his shirt sleeves and red braces (suspenders, as you may prefer) when delivering his comments about industry and money, including the stock market figures. Being old school, he wasn’t fooled about where money came from. He was scathing about the dizzy world of the dot com surge and wanted to know where the money was going and how it was being generated. As you say in your blog, it was all speculation and exciting words. Hot air and no substance. The man would say, often, ‘but we aren’t making anything’ and he was right. Britain’s manufacturing industry had fled and having bubbly young things telling us about how all this froth would make money didn’t convince him, and it showed.I haven’t listened to the man’s segment for some time but I expect he fell out of favour because he insisted in asking a question no one could answer, and Al-Beeb just don’t like that sort of thing.PS: near my home a lot of the taxi-drivers are Pakistani and it isn’t unknown for the licensed, named driver to be replaced when he doesn’t feel up to it by his cousin, who may or may not be qualified. I doubt anyone ever asks. I also wonder, as you never get a receipt from a lot of these guys, just how much their takings are declared.

        I’ve only become more familiar with Uber in the last few weeks with their coming to Las Vegas. I’m very happy to see the cab cartel-government cartel monopolies being gutted. If Uber is as you describe, or worse, it’s still a long step forward. As jimmy madison saw it, settling things by judging who has the better motives is a loser, so put those bad boys up against other bad boys and watch things shake out. The cab business did not reach a state of perfection and stay unchanged forever, it just stayed unchanged forever.
