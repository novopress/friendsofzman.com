        […] That last part is what no one discusses. The elites imagine a world like the college campus. At the top are the trustees who hire administrators to culture and cultivate the undergraduates who live communal lives. The new definition of socialism is the redistribution of happiness and self-actualization by a cloud people who rule as if they are gods. here…. […]

        I left the USA 17 years ago and Europe 11 years ago to end up in South America, where northwestern Europeans are not exactly popular, given that our work ethic is antithetical to that which prevails down here. Immigration into S.A. requires money and don’t think for a moment that if you don’t speak the local language you will be assisted or cut any slack whatsoever. The English-speaking US should act just as these folks do, and cut the interlopers (i.e. illegals) no slack whatsoever; in fact, best would be to expel them forthwith. ANY other policy is tantamount to demographic suicide.I have a Latina daughter-in-law and by default Latino grandsons, but if they don’t learn English, I will disinherit them. Happily, my son (their father) agrees. My grandsons are dual nationals and in spite of the fact that the US is more and more a suicidal state, I’ll be guddamned if those boys are going to be raised as Latino populists wihout a clue as to what makes a society work without the alien concept of fiat currency and the redistribution of wealth!

            You can walk 5 miles over the Arizona border into Nogales Mexico and be shunned if you’re a gringo. But we’re the xenophobes and racists. Don’t get me started on the hordes of unskilled, illiterate, unassimilated Somali and Sudanese Muslim refugees cruising through the supermarkets with bulging shopping carts bought on our nickel.

        While the media pretends that it’s all just about racism and xenophobia, so they can sweep it under the rug, I think people are just fed up. I think this issue maybe simmering under the  radar in a lot of places. In the USA, the case of Kathryn Steinle is emblematic of our elites demanding we roll over and whizz in the air, while they, the pols, spread their legs for every special interest group,…….except…… the everyday working American.BTW, where are the environmentalists and  zero population growth chicken littles?  Remember the handwringing over increasing population stressing fragile environments to the tipping point of no return.  Was that a bunch of contrived fabricated hooey, or is it that just normal workaday people pollute and stress the environment and illegals do not? Why do these people always talk out of both sides of their mouth?Also, do these people not realize that  BIG AG, factory farming, is becoming more automated?

        …America has, at least for the moment, lucked out with Trump entering the race.Without Trump immigration and lopsided ‘free’ trade pacts wouldn’t even beon the agenda.Instead, the RINOs would be giving us focus-grouped platitudes aboutwhat’s good for us.Anyone considering anyone else other than the Donald, should check their so-called conservative candidate’s positions, prior to Trump, not post Trump.Sure, Walker is now an immigration tough guy – but he was a “pathway to citizenship – immigration reform” guy just two year ago.And Kerryesque Cruz: He supported the TPP before he didn’tand expanded H1-Bs of course.I won’t even bother to mention the rest of the RINO surrender monkeys.The Republican establishment is awful.The Democrats let you know they’re leftists.Bill DiBlasio doesn’t hide his fellow traveler past and gets 73% of NY City’s vote.The Dems reward their minions with Bama-phones, Section 8 vouchers,ever-filled EBT cards and lots of big government jobs.But the Republicans betray their own middle-class voters at every opportunity.Dumb-ass trade pacts, H1-B expansion, open borders &amp; endless ME ‘refugees’,and then even facilitating O’s bogus Iran nuclear treaty –The Republican’s are traitors to their supporters, except of course to their big donors.Trump says that ¡Yeb! will be “the puppet of his donors.”Excepting Trump, how will the others be any different???…

        Immigration ticks number of boxes, all of which are considered doubleplus good.First, a government that invites immigrants (or in Britain’s case under the 13 years of vile NuLabour, actively begs immigrants to come to the UK) then you are seen as ‘caring.’ Caring wins votes.Second, you get the chance to buy in votes. Democracy may be an illusion but if you can get the immigrants to vote for you (again as NuLab did to ‘organise’ community leaders to gather up blank postal voting forms and fill them in on behalf of the elite) then you have a good chance of winning.Third, not only does it bring cheap labour and socially useful people into the country (I know people who purr at how much immigrants contribute to British society, though they rarely mention the fact that while Polish workers are far less likely to cause problems, the Pakistani-origin kiddy-fiddlers and Bulgarian criminals are the real issues) but it gives a government a morally superior position at international meetings. “See how much we do, so why aren’t you doing your share?”Fourth, it distracts the population from the fact that the government is probably in all sorts of deep and smelly doo-doo and stops those media ‘experts’ who aren’t in the ruling elite’s pockets from looking at how wretched society actually is.Admittedly, the population does get stirred up over immigration, but as it will be never be openly discussed in the halls of power, or even in parliament, then so what?

        Meanwhile, what is MSNBC promoting at the top and bottom of every hour?Global Citizenry!   Yea!   “The news is in: Beyoncé, Pearl Jam, Ed Sheeran, and Coldplay will all be headlining the 2015 Global Citizen Festival on Sept. 26 in New York City’s Central Park – and msnbc will be there to film the festivities live.”If you happen to catch any of it, you’ll note that it will have the vibe – and pretty much the hue – of a Bernie Sanders campaign event.At least the angry mob on the Right mostly recognizes it’s being led to the abattoir.  The hipster doofus sheeple of the Left don’t even see it.http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-you-need-know-about-the-2015-global-citizen-festival.Somewhat related:  I live in Irvine, California.  It’s VERY diverse, but not in the usual sense.  Everyone is computer science or bio-this-and-that.  Every nation in an arc stretching from Cairo to Hokkaido is well-represented.  These are the “model immigrants” everyone keeps yakking about……..highly educated, high incomes, minuscule crime rates, blah blah.And they could honestly give three flucks about being American.  I’ve been saying for years that for these people, America is nothing but a goddamned job fair.Anecdotal, but……….This past July 4 I rode my bike thru the neighborhood.  150 houses (all of which are priced in the high 6 figures, btw)I saw a total of 2 American flags out.  My place and that of another troglodyte white guy down the block.

        What you end up with is a new visualization, beyond the old left/right linear graph. You add a vertical axis, and turn it into an X-Y graph, like classic graph paper. The vertical axis is rich/poor, and position evaluation becomes a degree more complex. Basically all the announced candidates are in the cloud above the left/right axis, and want to make sure everyone possible stays on the other end of the rich/poor axis. If they have to bring in a horde of extremely poor to bring the average down, well, that’s just the price you’ll pay to make sure that they have a secure spot at the opposite end of the axis.

        Immigration is The Issue now because the hoi polloi are fed up big time. No, fed up doesn’t even begin to cover it, really. We know that if this isn’t stopped, and soon, we are done as a distinct and singular nation. Who feels our anguish? Or hears our pleas to stop this madness? No one but Donald Trump, it seems. And maybe he’s faking it, maybe not. This is no longer Red Team/Blue Team because really it’s the Purple Team vs. The People. I don’t see anyone standing up for the People except for Trump, and maybe Cruz. Possibly Carson, still watching and listening to him.

            Cruz was literally called a class traitor by Rich Lowry, but he was being descriptive, not accusatory. I think if Trump fades, Cruz picks up his vote. I would not be shocked if Cruz decides to go in with a immigration plan that is better than Trump in an effort to gain back the issue.

                I have to admit I’m concerned about Cruz’s past support for H-1B visas for foreign workers. My oldest will graduate from college next year with a degree in computer engineering. Will he be able to compete with the “slave wage” foreigners when the Dollar is the deciding factor for these traitorous companies? That’s what it is, IMO, when U.S. companies import foreigners to do the jobs that many Americans are more than capable, and willing to do; traitorous. Cruz needs to answer to this before he gets my support.
