If he were convinced, let’s say, that he could fly, society would take custody of him in order to prevent him from jumping off a building. He would be deemed a danger to himself and others. Similarly, if he started slashing his wrists or stabbing himself, he would be remanded to a psychiatric facility and appropriately restrained so he could not mutilate himself. Here…. […]

        An observation on Ms Jenner and the fierce insistence he be called she, and indeed once ‘fathered’ rather than fathered several children.I am told that he is now a woman. One is not allowed to question that, but here goes…I am also told women have a greater ability to see reds (which explains to some extent why men cannot imagine why there are so many shades of red lipstick as to them, most reds are the same.) But seeing more reds is one thing women do well, and possibly may explain why women are better at picking berries.Fair enough, so if Ms Jenner is now all-woman, has she suddenly gained the ability to see a greater range of reds? Or has all the surgery not altered her chromosomes enough so she is still stuck with good old male vision?

        “All the other girls in the K family are getting all the attention,  I’m pretty too, why won’t anyone pay attention to me.”:  Bruce Jenner.  Just kidding but maybe not.

        Let’s see where he (ahem) goes with this. First signs are that he’s got some paying gigs lined up, which if so, might mean he did it as a career move –  just chasing dollars. If he were to just fade away. or becomes a crusader of some sort, that would indicate other reasons for having done it.

            It’s alleged he is worth millions of dollars. If that’s true he’s not doing it for the money. He’s doing it because being Bruce Jenner gold medal winner is no longer satisfying.

        “maleness and femaleness were 100% cultural. … It’s what was behind the push to put girls into sports in the 1970’s.”and is now behind the push to get more women in programming, engineering, and science.
