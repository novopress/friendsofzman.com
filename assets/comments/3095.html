        My favorite no-knowledge-worthless-major is Queer Studies, but I’m guessing the athletes avoid that one like the plague. The diminution of our institutions of higher learning will continue until either the Education Cartels or the Federal government go belly-up, whichever comes first.

        As several people I know point out to me, education is not only teaching the unteachable what they have no interest in being taught but it is also a scheme for filling in a mountain of paper.The authorities and the management all demand that endless amounts of paper be filled out to show the ‘students’ (people who rarely study) have been educated. The fact that many of the kids leave school or college having resisted any such attempt is obvious to the world, though to the powerful controlling bodies they have all the evidence they need that it was all a screaming success.They have the correctly filed paperwork, so that’s that.

        College athletes get only a little sympathy from me.  As a group, they are as much a part of the scam as the school; it works both ways.  Not all of them, but a lot of them, especially the guys in the elite, big revenue sports like football and basketball, are in college only because that’s the best route out of poverty and into a lucrative career in the professional ranks.  Tighten the academic requirements and a lot of them will have to find a different way to perfect their craft.  And you can bet there will be a disparate impact on the black kids from the inner city high schools who spend virtually all their waking hours playing sports instead of cracking the books.

            Not all of them, but a lot of them, especially the guys in the elite, big revenue sports like football and basketball, are in college only because that’s the best route out of poverty and into a lucrative career in the professional ranks.This is not really the case these days. College basketball stopped recruiting the ghetto a long time ago. Instead, prep schools recruit the ghetto. They get these kids out at a very early age and into prep schools. That’s where the colleges go for talent. By the time a kid is recruited by Syracuse or Louisville, he has been out of the ghetto and in the system for a decade.In football, SEC school still troll the ghetto for players, but it is increasingly unnecessary. The supply of lower middle class kids from stable homes is sufficient to stock these programs. Notre Dame in the Lou Holtz era had to recruit Prop 48 kids to compete. That’s no longer necessary. People bemoan big money in college sports, but it has cleaned up many of the excesses. Big money mean big risk and that causes people to avoid things that can get them fired.

        Nothing can go wrong. The money goes to a reliable Cathedral constituency, which spends its days drowning normal Americans’ kids in Cult propaganda, until they start thinking it’s normal, high-status, smart people stuff. It’s great news that the debt is unsustainable, because the only politically feasible answer is to make normal Americans pick up the tab. There’s no mechanism for firing the legions of useless admin staff, across the board. We all know what effect price controls have. The only possible solution is socializing the losses.Tenured faculty and college administrators are on track to be a permanent, ever-growing privileged caste. Nobody can or will say “no” to those termites.And they’ll remain that way until the wheels come off. But until then, the Cathedral — or the Cult, as you call it — knows it’s business.But we all know we’re doomed. More important question: Baker’s or Blanton’s?
