        This will be Biden’s lasting legacy.  Weaponizing the dollar and letting neo-cons use it against the world was a terrible mistake.

            Stolen elections have consequences, especially when they install lunatic ideologues who are largely detached from reality.

                In non-partisan fairness, the same argument can be made if all elections were conducted honestly. The problem with democracies, as wiser men than me have noted, is that they tend to decline once citizens learn they can vote themselves benefits from the public purse and/or spend now and forward the IOU to future generations to — maybe — make good when the creditor comes calling. Nobody ever asks whether the future will be willing, or indeed even able, to pay that debt.Alas, extensive history shows that just because the majority believes something doesn’t make it a wise choice or even true.

            “Money printer go brrrrr” and weaponized sanctions started well before Biden.
The whole world is sick of it.
I remember a talk given by a former Air Force colonel discussing sanctions.  Essentially: “They don’t work quickly, but are designed to destroy your country over generations.”
Cuba an excellent example of this.   The Cold War ended a long, long time ago.  We’re still punishing Cuba.

                I would place the start of it with Bush. They sanctioned a group of banks that had been doing business with North Korea. The point was to cut off the NORKS from the global financial system and starve them of hard currency. It almost worked as they were just recovering from the famine. From that point the use of the dollar as a weapon went out of control.Dollar diplomacy has always been part of the toolkit, but never to the point where the world saw it as a weapon and certainly not as part of a regime change program. There is the real root cause. This idea that the neocons can select your government is the true evil.

                    I’m sure that sanctioning North Korea looked great on paper.
The real-world problem with doing that is the reality that NK has two powerful backing nations – China and Russia.
Both of those countries do not have an issue trading with NK. They are happy to do it directly or help the Norks set up all manner of cut-outs/fronts/shell companies, etc.
Again, this is what happens when there is a ruling class of bubble people that do not interface with actual reality.

                    Yep. A lot of damage in general started with Dubya. Obama was supposed to stop and reverse some of this. But he was both too weak and corrupt to do so.You can find graphs and charts that show the steady decline of the American share of global world trade. Most of this is due to the economic rise of China. Unlike our idiots who considered manufacturing, and particularly tech manufacturing, to be a “back room” low value added activity, the Chinese have always considered the primary industries, particularly manufacturing, to be the basis of an economy. Americans started consuming stupid pills starting around 1995 or so.

                    Zman, we put Iran under sanctions as soon as they kicked out the CIA backed Sha. That was probably the first very publicized instance. When people won’t follow you due to your virtue, well ya gotta use fraud, and when that fails, force!

                        Oh, you can go back a lot further. In 1941, the United States placed Japan under an oil embargo, seized its assets, and more or less did what was then the equivalent of kicking it off what became SWIFT (basically cutting most access to rudimentary TELEX). It did not end well.

                    Trumpbucks were a great lesson. Those envelopes with his signature in them were the nearest any normal person ever got to being the first spender of inflated currency, benefiting from inflation as bankerset aldo.Of course that’s not quite what happened. The system works, and benefiting the citizenry isn’t part of it. The numbers were negligible except symbolically—and except tonon-welfare broke guys,all of whose lives were briefly materially improved by the government for the first and only time (unless they stupidly “saved” the money).What we learned was who’s who(m). Who getsreally fucking angryat the thought of the designated losers of our financial system ever gettinganything? Every libertarian, almost every Republican, and every Democrat who understands that their party’s power is indeciding who gets paid, not in broad gestural magnanimity toward the citizenry—which they now (again) call fascism.If “the right” were right about the negative social/moral/etc. effects of Trumbucks style no-strings cash payments, Democrats would favor them. They do not. They pay specific people to do specific things—to be a specificinjury to others.

                Tater Joe is just a front-man …Plato and Aristotle wrote on this topic 2400 years ago. Politicians are interchangeable and replaceable foci for short-term alleviation of popular discontent. Democracy has always been a tool of oligarchy, including importation of diversity.“Tyrants favour immigration from distant cultures in order to dilute the strength of the moral standards against which their actions will be judged.” — Aristotle 384-322 BC.Of course, back then it was Greeks importing other Greeks from a different tribe, rather than Africans and Muslims. Tater Joe is a front-man for the worst of the two Jewish factions who compete to rule over us. They didn’t invent any of these techniques, they just amplified existing patterns into more civilizationally terminal outcomes. The goal of the Greek tyrant was simply to maintain power and wealth. The goal of the alien tyrants who currently rule over us is our extinction and replacement.

            It’s not Biden. Biden is only the latest in a long line of people abusing the privilege.It’s like the people blaming Biden for the inflation believe all of our problems started on Jan 2021.  Everyone was cheering the money printing before Biden.  Everyone cheered the free money covid checks.  The free money covid SBA checks.  The rent-free housing. The big fat UE checks during covid.  The zero interest rates. QE as far back as 08 and 09.I am certainly no fan of Biden. I did not vote for him and I would not vote for Kumala.  The theft of all the Russian money and the ridiculous sanction regime were terrible policy. But it wasn’t the first and it won’t be the last.

        I think this is another aspect of The Great Replacement. The imported helot/voting-machines get paid in dollars and send them back out to the country of origin. This keeps dollars sloshing around. Those who work above ground are taxed on payday – feeding the empire’s coffers. Then, they all pay large fees sending the money overseas and the banks gorge themselves on the fees. Then their family and folk spend the money back home on consumer goods branded by the empire’s merchant corps. Then those governments tax that and keep their loans to the empire’s real rulers – the banks, paid up.How do we know? The man in charge of The Great Replacement’s Finish The Job phase said so himself. It is a system of usury so vast it beggars belief.Brace yourself. One of the consequences of this is the numbers of aliens they are going to bring in will make the last 3.5 years seem like a trickle. Emporer Caracalla dissolved the Roman people when he granted everyone in the empire citizenship overnight.The GAE is effectively dissolving citizenship not around the Mediterranean basin when most couldn’t travel. It is doing it around the entire globe and handing people plane, boat and train tickets to come in and prop the empire up.This time the aliens are not the same Germanic/Aryan stock occupying the ranks and flooding the borders to essentially act as a great renewal of the people who once made Rome and Greece. No. It is a dissolution whose only source of perpetuation and replenishment is you and whoever has the will to stay strong and survive this Kali Yuga.The GAE is the most evil and corrupt entity the world has ever known. That means whoever runs it are the most evil and corrupt the world has ever known. The bloodthirst, insularity, perfidy of the most powerful of them is on display at the center of the global stage. We aren’t going to have time to worry about. Get ready for the tidalwave and dig in to survive. Were it just an economic calamity we would weather this no problem. Sadly, that is the least of our problems that The Regime is creating for us.

        “The steady decline of the dollar means a steady decline in the American standard of living, barring a revolution in Washington.”
It’s inevitable, period. With or without revolution. The tides of history and all that. It was good while it lasted but all good things come to an end. North America and western Europe are going to see — correction, arealreadyseeing — irreversible declines in the standard of living. I expect the decline to pick up momentum over the years.

                Many like to think so, but I doubt it.  For reference see the tweet I added a link to yesterday.  And Sailer, civnat to his core, even had a post about Indian Suketu Meta’s book “This Land is Our Land: An Immigrant’s Manifesto.”   All those born here travel back and forth constantly to visit family, and have never known a White America (just like Whites under 30).  They will stay and AINO will continue to become indistinguishable from the rest of the sh*tty non-White world.  Only thing left is try to build your progeny a solid financial and White social ark – nothing else worth working towards.

                    “They will stay”
They’ll look for other options, if they’re there. It will be a rational calculation. In the case of white Americans, what frequently holds them back from emigrating is friends and family here, long familiarity with the country, no fluency in any other language, and having been brainwashed into reflexively thinking it’s a dangerous world out there.

                        Arshad Ali:  I would argue it’s more complex and more fundamental than that.  Most White Americans have given little thought to what, exactly, makes them different (assuming that they are) from their immigrant ancestors.  That’s one of the first issues I confronted when I lived overseas:  Am I different?  What makes me American?  Does it matter?  Does it matter to me if my kids are American?  Why?There are a number of beautiful and civilized countries in Europe, but merely being born there – or even learning the language – does not make one Hungarian or Austrian.  There is no magic dirt anywhere.  But the old America – because of abundant land andresources, what used to be the sheer distance from “the homeland,” and the intermingling of various White, Christian ethnicities, did create a new sort of mindset and lifestyle.The distance, and the generations required, and the confidence of the founding population – all that is gone now.  I don’t ‘fear’ the world out there – but I’ve learned what means ‘home’ for me.  We were blessed to spend time in Vienna and London, but the wooded ridges of the Ozarks and the generally solid and hardworking White heritage Americans is where we’ve chosen.

                            “The distance, and the generations required,…”Well, if you’ve a culture that is ethnocentric and tends toward not mixing outside one’s “people”, e.g., Hasidic, or Romanian, or Amish—then never.  Indians might be different as they go back for family and marriage.  In short, they keep repopulating/reimporting.However for more normal races, 3-4 generations will do the trick.  That’s long enough for the last living memory “of the old country” to die off.  Worked for me.  None of my children have ever been to the “old country”.  Might as well tell them stories about “Middle Earth” and their Hobbit ancestors.  They are American—whatever that means today.

                                Compsci:  As long as they are White and of Christian heritage, I’d say 4 generations at least – until they’ve never known a living ancestor who either came from the ‘old country’ or who remembered his/her parent who was born there.  Make it a more ethnocentric group that tends to only marry within its ethnicity  – like the Greeks – and it takes much longer.  Again, ‘assimilation’ – to the very limited extent it even exists – is a two-way street.

                It will. But also white people with means and skills will be emigrating as well. In fact are emigrating. The grass really is greener on the other side. Just as the great-great-grandparents of today’s white Americans moved from Europe to North America because they were literally starving (Ireland, Germany, Norway) so also will today’s white Americans seek to leave the USA.

                    That strikes me as a very shallow view of what makes a people and a nation.  It’s why most people of any normal nation (except for current-day murkans brainwashed with the ‘nation of immigrants’ bullshite) look askance at the immigrant – especially one of a different racial and religious heritage.  Your interpretation is just a variation onrootless cosmopolitanism.

But your European ancestors must surely have felt the same way about the European country they were leaving, no? Blood and soil. But when times were sufficiently bad they made the move. Why do you think Americans won’t leave when confronted with similar choices — i.e., an increasingly tough life in the USA versus greener pastures abroad?

                            I think you and 3g are both right. 3g is correct that there is a certain blood-and-soil rootedness in most people which makes them loath to pull up stakes except under the most dire of pressures. You are also right that the vast majority of people have their price. If it’s a choice between starving to death in the fields outside of Blytheville, Arkansas or leading a middle-class existence in Bologna, Italy, very few people are going to leave their bones in Arkansas.

                                Ostei:  Yes – most people do have their price, and starving is one of them.  There also needs to be a realistic alternative.  For now, most White people don’t have one.  Unless you want to take the time and trouble to trace and prove and document ancestry, most European countries will not accept American Whites as citizens without a substantial amount of money.   My husband qualifies under both Italian and Irish laws but we decided the same problems apply there as here.

                                        There are any number of videos on countries to obtain a foreign passport from (Take that grammar Nazi’s!).   Can’t remember any from what we call the “West”.  What I do note however, is that in most cases—if not all—these countries did *not* give you voting rights, many no working rights, nor welfare, but only an residency right and perhaps protection under the law as provided their natural born citizens.  Non-voting rights seemed a particularly astute move.  If only we were that smart.

                As a first approximation, standards here would have to deteriorate to being worse than where most of the invaders came from. That’s a pretty bad drop. Unless, perhaps, there was a political sea change and the recent arrivals were “encouraged” by various active measures to exit posthaste.

            It all has to do with electronics and miniaturization. Back in the old mechanical days, actually took some talent and know-how to build, let’s say, an NCR cash register. It was not easy and not everybody could do it. Those things were mechanical and heavy and in their own way, a marvel of engineering. Now with electronics, they are practically a throwaway item. Anybody can build one anywhere in the world. Unless we can figure out something else nobody else can replicate, I think we become the new England and France. It was a nice run though.

        This happened because the US &amp; West “elites” were bloodsucking the system.  The final straw was Biden with his openly taking bribes and kickbacks using Ukraine as the vehicle.And then putting sanctions on Russia because they have some kind of hate fetish for Russia.  We visited Moscow &amp; St Petersburg in the early 2010’s.  I commented to my wife, “There is no reason anymore for us to not be friends with Russia.”Anybody with a lick of sense would have seen that since the 1st sanction didn’t work, that we should not have been piling one more and more sanctions.  What are we up to now, the 20th sanction?

        Splitting the world into two competing trade blocs will not be easy but I predict things will turn out for the best. The two sides will settle down peacefully to trade exclusively within their own trade blocs. Europe will accept its status as the New Africa of the world, a land of rising hope and opportunity. Our own new American citizens will inject a jolt of energy we have recently been sorely lacking in our economy. GDP will skyrocket from the diversity dividend. Women make the better decision-makers overall so the West has the edge there as well especially with steering ships into rocks.

                Now that it’s ragging on women in the navy day, the story whose dire implications still seem underappreciated is the one where the senior enlisted (female) on the ship had the secret internet connection antenna set up and lied to superiors about it for a good long while. But the worst part was she had the complicity and participation of the entire chief’s mess, male and female. The chief’s mess is supposed to be the backbone of the ship, the enforcer of order and discipline. Her punishment was demotion from E8 to E7 and there was almost no punishment for the rest of them. What does this tell you about discipline in the ranks of the USN?

                    Quick answer: There ain’t none. I know from my time with the Air Force Reserve and National Guard that discipline in the ranks isn’t what it once was. A lot of it is the soft generation we have now, but a lot of it comes from on high. The days of reaming people new assholes for stupidity are over.

                    What it tells me is access to the interwebs is more important to sailors than duty or honor.  The gals are one problem.  Diversity is another.  Chinese sailor-spies?  Iranian Pentagon-spies.  Its a good thing the Russians are white, or the DOD would be pushing their spies onto the ships, too.
And lets not forget the proud maritime traditions of the Africans and Aztecs.  If we just keep saying in hard enough it will come true:  Diversity is our Strength!

                    Endless empowerment, zero accountability.
In the old Brit Empire, they hung an admiral merely for not pursuing an enemy ship with sufficient vigor.  Losing your ship meant a rigorous inquiry and your career (and perhaps life) was kaput.
Not exactly the standard in the new woke/feminist military.  I doubt that the new military could win a war with Honduras.

        This is generally correct. However, there is one limitation with BRICS. None of the major countries that comprise it have a fully convertible currency. Neither the Russians nor the Chinese are willing to take this last step to make their currency fully convertible. I think this hesitancy is due to politics. This is why the Dollar will still remain the top currency used in trade. But its usage will decline over time. Currently 90% of world trade is in Dollars. This could decline to, say, 60% over the next 10 years if BRICS is successful.The lack of a fully convertible currency is why BRICS is talking about creating international finance institutions that would create SDR’s and other work-a rounds that would allow for trade without a fully convertible currency. This is similar to the old Breton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. I do wish them the best of luck. The bullying that our political class has inflicted on the rest of the world, particularly post 2001, is unacceptable to any self-respecting individual or nation. It is perfectly understandable that much of the world will seek other options for international trade.

            Also throw into the fact that the American-led financial empire is, at least traditionally, a fairly united bloc of like-minded white people. Yes yes, we have our interlopers and wannabes who try and plug into the Euro-American system, but the system and the rules are a product of the native peoples of the Anglosphere and of northern Europe. Yes yes, the rules have been subverted by bad actors and a certain avaricious ethny, but I would assert that your average white Iowan has more in common culturally and morally with a German or a Frenchman or an Ashkenazi than an average Russian has with a Chinese or an Arab or an Indian.I predict BRICS squabbles coming out of the new arrangement. It will not be unlike how the Greeks tried to make right with the German banks, and just couldn’t. At some point, the Arabs will get pissed off with, say, Chinese capriciousness and we’ll see semi-triumphant articles in The Economist.

            Bingo. Until the BRICS can figure out a reserve asset – besides T-bills – they won’t get far.
A Chinese businessman who sells $10 million worth of electronics to an Indian company will get a bunch of rupees that he doesn’t need. What does he do with them? He doesn’t want Indian bonds or other assets. By far, the best option is T-bills, so he converts the rupees to dollars and buys T-bills.
It’s not just about the dollar as the GRC. It’s about T-bills as the global reserve asset.

                    Gold would seem the logical answer. The businessman could convert their rupees or yuan or whatever into gold, which would be stored at the central bank. The physical gold would exist, but the buying and selling would be digital.
Gold is more volatile than t-bills, but it’s safe and likely won’t lose money after inflation like t-bills likely will in the future.

            Convertibility is not necessary. All that is necessary for a clearing house is a sufficient number of transactions in the various currencies. At the end of the day (or whatever clearing time period) all transactions in RMB are netted out, all Euros are netted out, etc. Only whatever is left over needs to be converted, and not even then. For the most part, the clearing house has the assets to let that difference ride overnight and pocket the interest. Which, in a world based on “real” growth rather than financial paper, means reasonable vig, as @Zman explains in his essay.

                Thinking on it a bit, there is a real opportunity for both sides to rapid reporting of these currency imbalances. If there are excess pounds in the system, it will be to England’s advantage not to lose value, so a Brazilian businessman and an English businessman might come to a deal that washes England’s books. For a price, obviously.
And, of course, the losers are those who don’t produce a damn thing but depravity. Which might be the only way out away from those people for America.

        In WWII the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor to start the war in the Pacific because we cut off their oil supply.   They surmised they had no other option.   The West will start a major war to try and prevent all of this.

            A war our depleted and too-PC military can’t win. We have barely 150 (187 if you count the non-combat coded jets) F-22s, while the Chinese are turning out hundreds of their equivalent jets.The F-35 is a world-beating jet, but it is expensive and is too dependent on vulnerable tankers and runways.We’ve fallen behind on UAVs. The ChiComs are putting hulls in the water and our corrupt military industrial complex is just a vast grifting scheme.We are still building littoral combat ships that are supposed to be modular warships able to do tasks with “mission modules,” but we don’t have enough of the modules because of technical issues and these ships are useless empty hulls without them.Unlike WWII, we don’t have the manufacturing and with modern weapons being ridiculously complex, we couldn’t build them fast enough even if we still had the workforce we did in the 1940s. It takes months, even at double shifts, to build an F-35 for example. Same with our now-aging M1 tanks. It takes years to build a warship or heck, even a vital replenishment ship.Years of neglect and “fighting a war of terror” on the Muslims have made our military unable to fight against a “peer” adversary. Our procurement system is so broken that the Pentagon can’t decide what it wants and changes its collective mind far too often.

        It’s my impression that a lot of people here don’t intend to vote, either on the perception that it’s a waste of time because it makes no difference, or because it actively harms by giving an legitimacy to and participating in the GAE.But I do invite anyone reading this to vote, especially if you are registered (or can still register) in one of the seven battleground states.1. Even if the Leviathan is gonna Leviathan no matter who is gets elected, most people on all sides interpret a vote for Trump as a middle finger to the Beast2. It’s a two or three hours if you have long lines, but for for me and probably many others, it’s like half an hour. You could easily spend more time dealing with a clogged sink on a given day.3. Obviously 2017-2021there didn’t “make America great again”, but it did slow down the constant massive pozzing of the Obama and Biden regimes4. There are ways a Trump presidency will make a tangible difference. One example: if Cackles wins, the nightmare will continue and perhaps worsen for the Jan 6th prisoners (as well as the zersetsung of so many others like Guliani, Eastman, etc). If Trump wins, the Jan 6ers will probably be released.

                Respect, I hope you do vote.To me, consistently each election voting for the candidate available who is closest to “based”/the populist right is like putting a tool away after using it rather than leaving it out on the counter, or taking a break during the work day to walk around the block instead of play a game on one’s phone.By itself, it’s not going to change much, but living a good life consists of many small actions like that.Military battles consist of a huge number of small unit actions that add up to battles won and lost.We can all wait for an American Pinochet suddenly arriving and in one grand swoop setting everything straight.  But, meanwhile, what are the actions, however small, that we can take in the war.

                The chief question is, failing a landslide one way or the other, does the vote even matter? It seems fairly clear to me that the Power Structure will install whomsoever it desires regardless of the actual vote tallies. But it does appear possible that Trump and the PS have cut some kind of a deal that would allow him back into the Anti-White House.

                            Ostei – if I understand you correctly, you seem to think that the numbers we see in tallies are close to made up. If so, I can understand such a sentiment. I think that we’re not quite there yet though. The regime has been hemorrhaging legitimacy for years now, and I suspect that if there is clear daylight between Trump and Cackles, rather than obviously rigging again and needing to solely resort to hard power, they’ll let him win and turn to plan B.In other words – your vote does matter and I hope you use it.

                                Certainly, the larger the vote-gap, the harder it is for the Power Structure to fortify Our Democracy. Is the gap large enough to obviate fortification? I have my doubts. But if it is, my vote is unnecessary anyway. And I don’t live in a swing state.

        Our rulers’ frittering away the reserve status of the U.S. dollar has much in common with their people trafficking. They bring in a few million impoverished third-world migrants overnight. Life goes on almost as if nothing has changed, since their productive first-world population still returns to work the next day.And they get to feel all virtuous.That is, until the latter retire or are replaced through affirmative action, whereupon they could find themselves living in another South Africa with no managerial slots reserved for folks of their skin color. Likewise, sacrificing the dollar’s global trade status on the altar of sanctions will have little immediate impact. Our elites can wallow unperturbed in their disdain for Putin, Xi, etc. Unfortunately, their offshoring of American industry over the past few decades means that when the world’s appetite for dollars does eventually wane, they will have very limited ability to satisfy their helots’ demand for goods. All the property heaped up through seignorage could become more of a target than a status symbol. What are the odds they’ll ditch “our democracy” for the protection of acaudillo?

        Yes, spot-on there.  As I mentioned in a recent thread, the dollar in my adopted country — my birth-nation having betrayed me and criminalized me — has been constantly de-valued during the past three years or so.This, simply, is because the (relatively) small banks and economy in this lat-am nation recognize that America no longer is a serious country, and what’s more, is intentionally destroying its own culture and economy in order to ‘Build Back Better’ which, of course, ain’t a-gonna happen.  Nobody else wishes to ride-along with America’s national suicide.Modern Western-based banking and the checking system originated with the Templars and their Crown agency, the East India Company.  A piracy scheme of occult practitioners.  Essentially, the Templars and their modern descendants of the East Coast Cryptocracy (of which Washington is a part) deliberately are ceding global control and subverting their own nation and people.  Culturally, this is most clearly visioned by the replacement of men and masculine culture by women and feminist culture.Men are the principle of order, women the principle of chaos, and so a feminist culture yields. . . well, what you witness taking place all around you.  The two sexes are the fundamental dichotomy on a planet based on dualism (day and night, heaven and earth, hot and cold, light and dark, black and white etc.)The nation has lost its way, and jettisoned God, in the most basic and fundamental way possible and, in a sense, no longer wants to live and is destroying itself from the inside out.  Other nations, looking on, DO want to live and so out of self-preservation are abandoning Her Majesty’s ship, now its gone daft.  Cheers.

            Weird claim:a planet based in dualism (day and night…)Night is what we call being in the shadow of our own planet. It’s theumbracast in the Sun’s light which concerns us, not a shadow cast by Moon light, which is really just reflected sunlight. Now how couldthis wandererbe based in part on a shadow?? That makes no sense at all.According to Scribbling, the Sun and other stars were made on the fourth day, which means that there was no night before that moment on the fourth day. A problem for your god’s credibility, however, is that Scribbling testifies that the god(s) made night and day three days before the Sun was made. It insists that the shadow called night was cast before there was any Sun.That amusing absurdity is just one of many reasons for people to evict Bereshit’s alien, omnimalevolent god(s) from their lives. They have been right to dismiss it (or them) as mythical. Context indicates that a literal interpretation of Ber. 1 was intended, but reality is what doesn’t go away when you accept a creationist myth as fact. The myth could have been sustained by sword and fire, but your faction lost the power to use those methods. Let that myth go.Maybe however there’s a way for you to salvage something of Israel’s god(s) from the landfill of history before the nations of western Evrope perish. Just read Bereshit unliterally, say, as allegory. There’s no reason to assume that a completely different meaning was not intended in addition to the clownishly erroneous—but intended—literal meaning.Perhaps Bereshit 1 is supposed to befirstlya cryptic story told by Canaanite ringleaders about how they established their nation, or a faction of a nation, or how they like to imagine that they organized theirselves. But then Bereshit is not very much about western Evropean people, now is it? At any rate, trinitarian versions are almost worthless for this purpose, correct unliteral interpretation. So you’ll need to obtain a better translation…or to learn how to read some Hebrew with a critical eye and imaginative thinking.

                    Ok, it still gets dark. So what? Do we have day and night if and only if Bereshit is true? Well, no.
I am correct. You are not. Change your mind.
Oh, and Bereshit is Hebrew. It’s the first word of the first verse of the first chapter of a book which you don’t understand. First word. You can look it up yourself on-line. There’s no need to buy another Bible.

        Zman covered all the bases.  I have no additional insights except to emphasize this one:
“What the BRICS summit in Kazan represents is decades of belligerently incompetent foreign policy in Washington.”
The arrogant recklessness of failing to negotiate with Russia in good faith before the Ukraine war, then the belligerent interference in the war pushed the Russians into alliance with China, and now India and the rest.
And instead of recognizing the threat this poses to Western Prosperity the ruling class doubles down on its arrogance and aggression.    We are doomed.

        “it means dollars and instruments denominated in dollars, like debt, will lose value on the global market.”Relative to what? Relative to gold and hard assets, maybe. Relative to other currencies, this is unlikely. I don’t have enough space here for an essay on the multi-trillion Eurodollar system. Suffice it to say that all these BRICS countries have debt denominated in dollars, reserves denominated in dollars, currencies which are either pegged to the dollar (China), or are so volatile (Brazil) or in a state of constant depreciation versus the dollar (India) that they are unsuitable for central-bank reserves. Our country will probably collapse before the dollar does.

            “Relative to what? Relative to gold and hard assets, maybe. Relative to other currencies, this is unlikely.”Yep. Also relative to commodities, goods, services, really everything that isn’t imaginary, like fiat currencies. And America may well be able to flog the other fiats, at least for a while, unless maybe BRICS sets up its clearing house properly. Think the last bit of “Trading Places.” If BRICS sets the rules that every country settles accounts at the end of the day, on pain of loss of clearing privileges, suddenly that puts US hegemony in a completely different light. That rule makes BRICS basically expense-free, and able to get by on only a small skim on every transaction. Participating in SWIFT would be cost-prohibitive for most countries.This would mean US needs to boost exports YESTERDAY. IAs and blue-haired fat chicks and soy boys currently get handouts that raise the money supply. That’s exactly the opposite of what US would need to compete on the world market. All those suddenly become the liabilities that everyone knows they are, and finally that’s how they show up on the balance sheet.US could continue to import, but only to the extent they (we) are willing to pay the extra to participate in a gray-ish market. But dead weight is dead weight. The Fed would have to deflate, and FedGov would be forced to “liquidate” its liabilities, i.e., non-producers. Sure, they will start with white retirees, but that’s not going to be nearly enough.

        This is unintentionally hilarious:Israel and the BRICS: A tightrope to walk | Allia Bukhari | The BlogsExcerpt:Most of the current BRICS members do not share the same loyalties to Israel the way many Western countries do, and it allows them to embrace a harsher stance concerning Israel’s actions. Despite a divided Global South, post-colonial grievances with the western world unite these countries in seeing Israel through a critical lens. The BRICS is also emerging as a counterbalance to the “pro-Zionist stance” of the West and its expansion does affect Israel in its efforts to normalize ties with nations in this part of the world.The challenge for the current members of the BRICS would be maintaining their individual economic and commercial ties with Israel, condemning Hamas while simultaneously navigating their role as the anti-colonial voice of the Global South.Challenge??? The lack of self-awareness is off the charts, but we knew that.

        Well, if the Blackberry Fruitcake Empire can no longer bully and browbeat other nations into submission with their control of the fattest wad, then it will find it much more difficult to use its military to impose its cultural agenda as well.

        “What the BRICS summit in Kazan represents is decades of belligerently incompetent foreign policy in Washington.”Perfect. And Biden/Harris are the epitome of this. At least Trump is a realist businessman.However, a major problem I see for BRICS is lack of trust among its members. Almost mutual hatred in some cases (China-India). And these “economic miracles” have been built on access to the gigantic American and European markets. I also note basket-case South Africa is the “S” in BRICS (for “Shithole”, presumably): are they going to replace demand from California and Germany in the event of a West vs BRICS trade war? With their 40% unemployment and decaying infrastructure?

        Big topic. Speaking of the steady decline of the dollar, I continue to marvel that they were able to sell 2% annual inflation as normal and even desirable. In an honest, healthy system, 0% would be the target.The population explosion of the Global South was a direct result of the globalized USD trading system. Just today I saw an article about Zimbabwe’s new gold backed currency failing, but what struck me about it was a picture of a young Zimbabwean boy going to a food aid station. I’m sure that food aid didn’t come from inside Zimbabwe. I am not predicting the future, just taking in the possible implications.

                To put a finer point on it, the only agriculturally self sufficient country in Sub Saharan Africa is South Africa, thanks to the Boer continuing to do his thing. Every single other one relies on food imports, mostly from outside of Africa. SA no longer produces enough to export a whole lot. And although I lack data to support this assertion, I believe that very few of them are paying for very much of their food imports with their own money. I consider the implications of this in the context of a collapsing global USD economic order.

        This post is yet another excellent exposition of the core problem. We have the diagnosis, now what is the remedy? Can voting harder save us? Can a messiah save us? Can a magic incantation rouse the masses into what (protest marches, riots, civil unrest, revolution)? The Soviet Union died a lingering death in 1991 and a new Russia was born from the ashes a decade later. A well-orchestrated purge can accomplish same in a much shorter time frame.

        Day dreaming that the BRICS cartel grows in power enough to demand the physical persons of the western banking cartel families and presents public tribunals listing their volumes of crimes against humanity before pronouncing their richly deserved death sentences. Member nation Saudi Arabia graciously volunteers to carry out this service for the worlds’ peoples in their usual way. That would make a great x-tube insta-toc video… ‘Sau-di-style’ to the beat of the sound of scimitar chopping and dancing people from all over the world. Without masks this time. A new chapter in the mythology of eternal  victimhood is born The Kazan Khazarian Katastrophe.

            Let’s suppose for a minute that you’re correct about the albatross. Who keeps it there?
The albatross isn’t very intelligent, and it’s greatly outnumbered, by ten or more to one. Its main strategic advantage appears to be a national culture perpetuated with a national literature that gullible White Man often believes is about him, too, even though it’s not.

                My working theory is that they are insane.
Hyperphobic of all any any potential threats and either largely cut off and cloistered from the rest of society, or.. for the one’s who aren’t cloistered… they have drank from the same poisoned well and are afflicted by Jim Jones disease, a.k.a. “Tabula Rasa” theory.
Which sounds nice to women, but it’s not reality.
Them being a matriarchally predisposed culture is also definitely a factor.

Don’t forget Hong Kong.  All of the trade through China goes through HK. It is Hong Kong who handles all the currency stuff for Chinese trade. This is one of the things that made Hong Kong so wealthy.

            Bingo. That and the cherry on top is transfer pricing: Hong Kong has a bunch of container terminals, so all you need to do is export from your China factory to Hong Kong at Price A (booking some profit to be taxed inside the PRC in RMB at ~25%) and then export from Hong Kong at Price (A+whatever) in freely convertible US dollar pegged Hong Kong Dollars taxed at 0%. You can then send your US$ anywhere in the world *or* ‘reinvest’ them back into the PRC under some ‘foreign investment’ dodge. What’s not to like? 😀That’s my kindergarten level understanding of just one of the smaller rackets enabled by having a non-freely convertible currency with conversion permitted in only a limited number of ways and locations. Seems all a bit sleazy, but then compare it to what ‘free trade’ has done to the USA and Rest of the West.Macau is an interesting place. It’s the gambling steam release valve for the PRC of course. But it’s also where the various East and South-East Asian underworlds settle their (literal, as in books) accounts. With all that cash sloshing around and nicely laundered casino checks for the leftover unmatched amounts  at the end of each accounting process, it’s the right place to set up an offsetting shop where everyone settles up with everyone else.

        Sundance at CTH offers an interesting perspective on the sanctions against Russia:
They are not intended to keep Russia out, but are intended to keepus, the citizens in the West,in.
The end goal is a government issued digital currency, which will, of course, be used to keep us, the proles, in line. Step out of line, and they can not only take all your funds, but they can prevent anyone from giving you any.

        It should be noted that India and China are enemies.  Each one of the BRICS will want to be the true power behind the throne.  I’m not as optimistic about their chances because they will squabble.  OPEC has this problem.The West still has the biggest strategic advantage, which is common ancestry and a somewhat common language.  You can get pretty far along in Europe on English alone.The acronyms of BRICS speak Spanish, Russian, Hindu, Mandarin, and English.  No common history.  No cultural bonds.  If you think white people are a pain in the ass these days, we got nothing on that Star Wars cantina club.The question that remains for me is whether the lizard people running the west are actually trying to help BRICS succeed.  To meet their bizarre “climate” goals, they have to massively depopulate and deflate their economies.  A way to do that is to create an alternative.That’s how China ended up with ICBM MIRV technology.  Clinton didn’t like the US military advantage, so he gave China MIRV technology which accelerated their space capabilities by about 25 years.I would be unsurprised to learn that one of these WEF-like pod people forums is helping BRICS.

OR what is far more likely is that they’ll keep pumping out dollars (or ramp it up(, then change the calculation for inflation (again) and have their mouthpieces in the media lie and gaslight and say, “well actually inflation isn’t that high rube.

        anyone here agree with me that looking just at elections only tells part of the story? Like the story goes that the democrats were losing a lot of elections by a lot (see Walter Mondale) and they needed to find someone to run who was more palatable to mainstream audiences to win. It wasn’t until Bill Clinton that they found that someone.But my view is that this is the wrong way of looking at things. I feel 40 years ago, Harris would have lost the PV by a margin worse than Mondale. And the fact she’s on pace to, worst case scenario, lose the popular vote by a 3-4 margin, shows that something beyond demographics has changed. That fact alone I think is the real story.

        The sad part is that America didn’t need move towards this dead end…We didn’t need to outsource manufacturing, or bring in foreign workers, or open the borders to savages who are living off our taxpayers..We allowed the first two for the express purpose of lowering wages, and making more money for corporations…We allowed the border disaster for political reasons, mainly to capture the single, childless, female vote…As Trump has sort of pointed out, the period before the income tax when the Feds depended on tariffs for financing, was the most prosperous in American history….

        The impoverishment of the country is a process that has been going on for awhile. I sometimes point out to my family that what they perceive as an increasing cost of living is actually a sign of increasing poverty. If what you buy goes up 10% in cost but your wages only go up 5%, you are objectively poorer. You can cover up the difference by going into debt but that makes the problem worse in the long run, as the debt must be repaid with interest or discharged through bankruptcy. If enough people/businesses can’t repay their debts, you get an economic crash, which is something like a national bankruptcy. In times past, when the country had a productive industrial economy, the national bankruptcy could be discharged through wealth creation. We no longer have such an economy and the recovery from such a crash will be long and leave us poorer overall. Take away the dollar as reserve currency and what will be left after the crash is a Third World nation. Many of cities already resemble such nations.

        It will be interesting to see if Washington attempts to sabotage the BRICs somehow. Perhaps they’ll start experiencing an unknown series of computer glitches in the months to come. The NSA — the Puzzle Palace — probably has access to some pretty good hackers, if not in-house then in the nether reaches of American society.A computer Lord may find himself with a pretty good deal: wreck this platform and we’ll drop the charges against you. If that oil pipeline in Europe was sabotaged by America, I wouldn’t put it past them to do the same but only to computers.— Greg (my blog:http://www.dark.sport.blog)

            You don’t remember the Hong Kong protests in 2019? We are always and everywhere sticking our nose where it doesn’t belong. Why do you think Putin is very aggressive against the LGBTQ shit? He knows they use that crap as a way to create wedges and force themselves in where they aren’t wanted.  Read up on color revolutions, we had one here in 2020.

                The PRC media helpfully published photos of local protest leaders meeting in a hotel coffee shop with accredited NED people based in the US Consulate in Hong Kong. The then Twittersphere following the protests was full of journalists, NGO types, and people who had been heavily involved in the Kiev Maidan colour revolution.There’s no smoke without fire and the youngsters who participated (instigators were a different kettle of fish) in those protests had legitimate real grievances which are not relevant to the meta discussion. What’s truly disgusting is the callous way in which they were set up to fail and lives blighted just so that the GAE could ‘score points’ against the PRC.That being said, if you added up the prison sentences and time served to date, there’d be fewer Hong Kong Protest man-years in the hoosegow here than there have been for Jan 6. Also there’s no Negro Ass Rape in Hong Kong prisons.

        There is something concerning China that is missing from most conversations about world trade and the historic dominance of the West, particularly of the US$. Our dominance began with the great explorations of the 16th century, and there was another surge of dominance that started in the 18th century with the industrial revolution. That block party is about over. The convergence of Asian prosperity with the Western economic system was supercharged by the emergence of Chinese economic strength. From about 500 B.C. until the early 17th century, China was the world’s wealthiest nation. The last 500 years of Western economic hegemony has been an aberration. History is simply about to return to its accustomed patterns. Like a sleeping volcano, the Eurasian landmass is awakening once more.

            Europe was wealthier(per capita) as early as the 14th century. I think the Roman empire was wealthier than China or India. Your account is tied to the lie that Europe became wealthy through colonialism.
If you convert wealth of that era into US 1990 dollars per purchasing parity then one can state that  in 1500  Italy had 1100 versus China 600,India 550.
More detail : Italy 1100,France 724,England 714,HRE 688,Spain 661,China 600,India 550,Japan 500, Ottomans 496, Egypt 475.

                At the risk of sounding crude, that’s Jew Money Talk though. Leavened with a bit of Boomer Prosperity Gospel.In 1500 nobody feared Florence. Selim the Grim was another matter entirely: he could out-arm and out-man any single European state and plenty of them severally. A generation or so later France was cutting deals with his successor Suleiman the Magnificent to @#$% over the Hapsburgs and wintering his huge fleet in Toulon to the disgust and horror of the rest of ‘Christendom’.Whether or not a coal miner in Shaanxi is richer or poorer than one in Appalachia is moot. (I’d put my money on the one in Shaanxi having more chance of sending his kid to college, but that’s just me… I’m a PRC shill at times). Or are you richer in Shanghai because you can get the clean and shiny subway at midnight sans hallucinating shit stained negroes pushing you onto the tracks?What matters is who has the greater useful and usable military throw weight and who makes and trades more stuff than the other and whose word is more or less their bond in diplomacy and trade. Now you might have some prejudices about Chinese duplicity and sharp trading practices, but ask yourself how the rest of the world sees the USA in the Current Year. Respect matters.The other thing about China and have to grudgingly admit India too is that both of the have truly understood in the (3g4me trigger warning)groksense the Glubb Pasha 250 year dynastic cycle and have survived many multiples of these. The first sentence of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms beings thusly:It is a general truism of this world that anything long divided will surely unite, and anything long united will surely divide.Every Chinese knows this by heart. Inevitably something as yet unknown will take them down in the next century or so just as we are being taken down right now for reasons we only dimly grasp. But they’ll be back. Again and again. Will we? That’s the real question.

                    A lot of words with little effect and not addressing my main point about how Europe was not some dirt-poor backwater. Maybe if you were less allergic to facts you would be aware of China’s ridiculously poor military history only overshadowed in ineptitude by that of India.As for your mighty Ottomans ,they would soon be thrashed at Lepanto by a mostly Spanish fleet which would be subsequently put to the sword by the English. The  French betraying Europe with the Ottomans is much more an indicator of their perfidiousness than a sign of the superiority of the Ottomans over Europe.So much for your claims of the military power of the non European polities .When you respond to someone try to respond to what they said rather than the argument you wish they stated.I don’t mind you being crude it’s the retardation I find irritating.
